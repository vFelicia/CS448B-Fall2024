00:00 - learn how to use figma variants to
00:02 - design a scalable mobile app from amit
00:05 - who is a very experienced ux designer
00:09 - variants can streamline your front-end
00:11 - design process by allowing you to group
00:13 - and organize similar components into a
00:16 - single container hey guys and welcome to
00:20 - a brand new tutorial now in this
00:23 - tutorial what i'm going to share with
00:25 - you is actually how to build a scalable
00:28 - mobile application step by step on figma
00:32 - now this course is actually done in a
00:36 - two separate stages in the first stage
00:39 - what you are going to learn is basically
00:41 - going to be an overview we are going to
00:44 - learn some of the figma's best tools
00:46 - such as how to use frames how to use the
00:49 - auto layout how to use components so
00:51 - that you can build scalable apps on your
00:54 - own but all these three concepts will
00:56 - tie into my favorite components which is
01:00 - variance you will learn how to use figma
01:03 - variants so that you can create scalable
01:05 - applications that are also flexible that
01:08 - have a different variations for your
01:11 - elements so that your designs will not
01:13 - look just like a standard app
01:16 - now what also matters in this course is
01:18 - that i also have added a homework a
01:21 - practice file if you wish that i am
01:24 - actually going to add to the description
01:26 - of this video below so that you can take
01:29 - it and practice the concepts you'll
01:31 - learn to solidify and master it on your
01:34 - own the homework has suggested solutions
01:37 - attached already so don't worry we have
01:40 - everything covered here and then after
01:43 - we gave you the overview and maybe you
01:46 - practiced the homework then you can do
01:48 - the tutorial where we will build a
01:50 - mobile app from scratch it's actually a
01:53 - great long tutorial and i know you will
01:56 - enjoy it and before we go any further if
01:59 - you are new here my name is ahmed and
02:02 - i'm a ui ux designer currently living in
02:04 - canada waterloo and i will be your host
02:07 - today and i will see you on the tutorial
02:10 - but before we begin the tutorial and
02:13 - give you an overview of what you are
02:15 - going to learn
02:17 - what i want to do first is that i want
02:20 - to show you how to use the two figma
02:22 - files i will add to the description to
02:24 - this video below so that you can follow
02:27 - along the tutorial but also get your
02:30 - homework so that you can actually
02:31 - practice what you learned so that you
02:33 - can master the concepts easier
02:37 - now once you go to the description and
02:39 - click one of those links you will have
02:41 - either the tutorial initial screens file
02:44 - or you will have the homework file and
02:46 - doesn't matter which file you are on
02:48 - what i want you to do to actually have
02:50 - the ability to edit these files is you
02:53 - want to click on the drop down here and
02:55 - you want to press duplicate your drafts
02:57 - and let's go to the homework file and
02:59 - let's do that let's say
03:01 - drop down duplicate your drafts and now
03:04 - that is actually saved and i want to
03:06 - press open so now this project is
03:08 - actually copied to my own account and
03:11 - now i actually can edit it if you don't
03:14 - follow this step you won't be able to
03:16 - edit the file because
03:18 - i will not give you an added access for
03:20 - the master file you have to copy it on
03:22 - your own so that you can actually edit
03:25 - it on your own account
03:27 - so once you are here one more thing
03:29 - about the homework file before we go on
03:32 - each homework file actually has an
03:34 - exercise so each homework file has a
03:36 - suggested solution
03:38 - and it and in the main homework frame
03:42 - what you have is that you have your
03:43 - instructions and then you have four
03:46 - different exercises each exercise
03:49 - actually has
03:50 - a solution where if you click on the
03:52 - component here and press ctrl shift h
03:55 - you can view it and then if you press
03:58 - ctrl shift h again you can hide it that
04:00 - is for windows for mac if i'm not wrong
04:03 - it should be
04:05 - command shift h to hide and show and
04:08 - that is how you can compare and contrast
04:10 - your solutions and again if you have any
04:12 - questions whatsoever just comment on
04:15 - this video and i will actually do my
04:17 - best to help you
04:19 - and let's go
04:24 - all right so let's get cracking now what
04:29 - you see right now in my window is the
04:32 - end result of what we are going to
04:34 - design today in this tutorial and what
04:38 - you see is roughly 10 to 12 screens of a
04:41 - activity app that is a mobile app where
04:44 - you get to choose which city you are
04:46 - visiting then you get to pick your
04:48 - activity and you schedule it
04:51 - and then you pay for it at the end so
04:53 - that is going to be the main workflow
04:56 - and
04:57 - the goal for us though isn't just to
05:00 - design this high fidelity mobile app the
05:03 - goal is also to create it and design it
05:06 - with various thing metals and the most
05:08 - important being variants so that it is
05:12 - much more easy
05:14 - to make it scale later
05:16 - and
05:17 - that is what we are going to do today
05:20 - and it's going to be amazing so make
05:22 - sure you stick around till the end of
05:24 - this video and let's get started now if
05:27 - you like this tutorial and you want to
05:30 - get better at ui ux design specifically
05:33 - i have my own personal channel with my
05:35 - name ahmed aferoglu where i post twice a
05:39 - week videos on uiux design on how to get
05:42 - better at figma how to get better at
05:45 - communications how to get better at ui
05:47 - ux design whether that is soft or hard
05:50 - skills so you can actually become a
05:52 - better uix designer you can also go to
05:55 - the free code cam channel for this
05:57 - tutorial where they actually post
06:00 - all kinds of videos from development to
06:03 - security to ui ux design so that if you
06:07 - want to learn holistically all these new
06:09 - technologies free code cam is actually
06:12 - one of the best channels that i know
06:14 - please make sure you subscribe to this
06:16 - channel as well it's been amazing for me
06:19 - to actually learn front-end development
06:21 - and back-end development and i'm really
06:23 - glad this channel exists
06:29 - so before we actually began the process
06:32 - of designing the high fidelity mobile
06:35 - app and make sure that we are using
06:37 - variants we have to cover our bases
06:40 - now because i do not know what your base
06:43 - level of skill is on figma whether that
06:47 - is using its tools or features
06:50 - i have to make sure we are going to
06:51 - cover the basics of what we will use so
06:54 - that you will be able to use the
06:56 - variants that will help your app be much
06:59 - more scalable and to do that i have to
07:03 - actually show you how to use frame
07:06 - auto layout component and variance on
07:09 - figma
07:10 - and
07:11 - if you are new to this don't worry i'm
07:12 - just going to show you in a second but
07:14 - also if you want to solidify what you
07:17 - learn if you feel uncomfortable still
07:20 - after this
07:21 - quick tutorial if you want to solidify
07:24 - what you learn
07:25 - in the description of this video there
07:27 - is a homework link that you can go it
07:30 - has suggested solutions already where
07:33 - you can practice what you learned here
07:36 - and that would solidify your knowledge
07:38 - before you actually go on
07:41 - to
07:42 - do this whole design process from
07:44 - beginning to end
07:45 - so let's get started with framing and
07:48 - also before i start if you look at the
07:51 - bottom left corner i have the shortcuts
07:54 - coming in i'm gonna actually move my
07:57 - yep i'm gonna move my picture to the
08:00 - right so on the left side you can
08:02 - actually see
08:03 - here
08:04 - that i have the
08:06 - key caster tool so that you can actually
08:09 - see what i'm pressing when i'm doing
08:10 - certain shortcuts and i would like to
08:12 - apologize in advance the shift key is
08:15 - buggy so it doesn't show make sure you
08:18 - also hear listen to my voice for the
08:20 - shortcut
08:26 - so anytime i actually want to understand
08:29 - how a certain feature of tool works i
08:33 - basically try to use it in the most
08:35 - simplest ui element possible so i do not
08:39 - focus on what i'm designing but how i
08:41 - will use the tool and the simplest ui
08:43 - design element that i know and you guys
08:46 - know is a button
08:47 - so what i will do is now i will design a
08:50 - button with a frame so i will
08:52 - pick the f short key and i'm gonna move
08:55 - my profile again there you go so i'm
08:57 - gonna press on f as my short key here
09:01 - and i'm gonna drag a frame
09:04 - and i'm gonna set this twist to 128
09:07 - pixels for width
09:08 - and 48 pixels for height and right now
09:11 - it does not have any fill color so if i
09:14 - click on fill here
09:18 - now it does and i'm going to pick a
09:19 - grayish color and now we have something
09:22 - like a background
09:23 - and i'm gonna add to this frame a text
09:26 - so i'm gonna click on the frame
09:28 - press t
09:29 - for the shortcut for text and i'm gonna
09:32 - say login
09:34 - now i'm gonna pick the auto wet so the
09:37 - text doesn't stretch horizontally
09:40 - and now what i want to do is i wanna
09:42 - center it and having a frame basically
09:45 - allows me to group elements that are
09:48 - have to be in the same group visually so
09:51 - for a button that would be your
09:53 - background and that would also be your
09:55 - label text for let's say an input field
09:58 - input text field you might want to frame
10:01 - your label you might want to frame your
10:04 - placeholder and you might want to frame
10:06 - your background all in just one single
10:08 - frame
10:10 - and it also gives you certain powers
10:12 - such as
10:14 - basically making the content very easy
10:16 - to actually align so i can actually
10:19 - center a line horizontally i'm
10:20 - vertically in the right side here
10:22 - and that works right now pretty good
10:29 - now another power that the frames give
10:31 - you on figma is they are a gateway to
10:34 - actually creating more scalable ui
10:37 - designs and the one way to actually make
10:40 - your design much more scalable is to use
10:43 - it with auto layout if you add the auto
10:46 - layout portion to a frame and to do that
10:48 - you have to click on
10:50 - plus and i'm going to do that but i'm
10:52 - just going to copy and paste this
10:54 - so we have an example so on the left
10:57 - side i will have a normal frame and on
10:59 - the right side i will have a frame with
11:00 - an auto layout
11:02 - and boom so what this frame right now
11:06 - has is this
11:07 - auto layout basically lets us
11:10 - dynamically stretch our button no matter
11:13 - what the input that is one of the powers
11:16 - it can give you and i'm gonna show you
11:17 - what i mean so look at the left side the
11:20 - left side is the button again with the
11:22 - no auto layout functionality and i'm
11:24 - just gonna write n n n n nnn and this
11:27 - happens all the time you might have a
11:29 - button with the label login but it might
11:32 - also become submit or download and you
11:35 - might want to use the same design and
11:37 - you don't want to recreate it all the
11:38 - time
11:39 - and
11:40 - for that reason auto layout kicks in
11:43 - very well so if i do and and and n right
11:46 - now you can see this button scales on
11:49 - its own and it so what figma does is it
11:52 - lets you pick the margins the paddings
11:54 - around the element and you can specify
11:57 - here let's say center let's do
12:00 - 24
12:01 - 24 and no matter the text size
12:05 - this
12:06 - button will scale horizontally even if
12:08 - you increase the text size while keeping
12:11 - the right
12:12 - left
12:13 - top button padding the same now is this
12:16 - the only power of the auto layout
12:18 - feature does it only let us design
12:20 - buttons of course not another good way
12:23 - for you to use it is instead of just
12:26 - scaling horizontally
12:28 - also vertically what you can do is you
12:31 - can also use it to add spacing between
12:34 - elements so you can actually use this
12:36 - for more complex stuff for example let's
12:39 - create a new card by pressing f
12:43 - to create our card frame let's fill it
12:45 - with white let's add a drop shadow with
12:47 - effects here
12:49 - and that's a very rough drop shadow but
12:51 - that will do for now
12:53 - and let's add a title
12:57 - and let's get this to be 18 pixels let's
13:02 - fold it out with ctrl b
13:04 - and
13:05 - let's just copy and paste it again here
13:08 - and let's say loram epsom
13:12 - basically let's have our text here
13:15 - let's make this 16
13:18 - and unbolt it okay so we have a title we
13:21 - have a body
13:22 - and we are inside this frame and one
13:25 - thing you usually do is you really want
13:27 - to make sure that there is a certain
13:29 - spacing around your card but also
13:32 - there's a certain spacing between
13:33 - elements
13:34 - so what you can do is if you add the
13:36 - auto layout to your frame here
13:39 - and instead of
13:41 - horizontal direction which we chose for
13:43 - buttons here
13:45 - you can choose the vertical one and you
13:48 - can also specify the
13:51 - spacing between items meaning what's the
13:53 - space gonna be between our title and
13:56 - body text and let's pick that to be 12
13:58 - pixels
14:00 - and also we can add the margins of
14:03 - 16 pixel 16 pixel
14:05 - 16 pixel and you want to be around here
14:08 - so what now happened is we have a left
14:12 - margin of 16 top margin of 16 a margin
14:15 - of 16 and right margin of 16 but the
14:18 - spacing between our elements is 12
14:20 - pixels
14:21 - and this is very useful because what
14:24 - this will lecture is
14:26 - it will make it very easy to make your
14:28 - designs consistent you won't have to
14:30 - check the distance between each element
14:32 - vertically
14:34 - almost ever again if you
14:36 - know how to master the auto layout
14:38 - feature
14:43 - now let's move on to components so you
14:46 - have your frames and you have your
14:48 - auto layouts
14:50 - and let me zoom out a bit with shift
14:52 - zero
14:53 - so what is the value of components and
14:55 - what is it and that's a very good
14:57 - question and to do that i am gonna first
15:00 - create another screen
15:02 - and let's make that a iphone 13 mini
15:07 - and
15:08 - let's
15:10 - what we are going to do is we are going
15:11 - to copy this button again and paste it
15:14 - just below here
15:16 - so
15:17 - you having a frame an auto layout makes
15:19 - it scalable but you still have a problem
15:22 - let's say we decide to use this button
15:25 - i'm gonna control c to copy
15:27 - and ctrl v to paste on this
15:30 - iphone 13 screen which is a very empty
15:33 - screen i know i'm like ah i always
15:35 - forget to place this profile
15:38 - in the right but okay
15:40 - so we have this very boring screen what
15:43 - can we do really
15:45 - what can we do to basically show us the
15:48 - problem that we might have what i will
15:50 - now do is that
15:52 - i want to basically
15:55 - have the second screen of mobile screen
15:58 - and that is also normal you usually will
16:00 - have 30 to 50 and i want this to be
16:03 - actually
16:04 - let's say
16:07 - login as well
16:08 - but
16:09 - during the design i realized that
16:12 - i actually want this to
16:15 - be blue color and let's make this blue
16:18 - oh yep let's make this blue
16:21 - so
16:23 - i designed this color i designed the
16:26 - color of this button again but you can
16:28 - realize even though i copied and pasted
16:30 - from this color this button
16:32 - its color did not change and now picture
16:35 - this let's say you have 50 mobile
16:37 - screens and you realize your
16:39 - color for your button is wrong and you
16:42 - actually wanted blue instead of brown
16:44 - and you have to go now so 50 other
16:46 - screens and change the color each time
16:49 - and that is a hassle and that takes so
16:51 - much time
16:53 - what components do is they actually
16:56 - solve this problem specifically what
16:58 - components do is
17:00 - they let you create a master element and
17:02 - to do that we have to first make this
17:05 - button a component first
17:07 - and the way to do that is
17:10 - control
17:11 - alt k on windows now this is a component
17:16 - and what you can do is i'm going to
17:18 - delete these buttons now
17:21 - what you can do is to actually use a
17:23 - component in the actual
17:25 - app screens you have you go to assets
17:28 - each component shows on the assets panel
17:32 - here
17:33 - and it basically lets you organize your
17:36 - files and this becomes very handy it's a
17:38 - drop down here so it becomes very handy
17:41 - once you have multiple let's say types
17:43 - of components and to fetch it you
17:46 - basically drag the component you picked
17:48 - and it's here
17:51 - and you can also copy and paste like a
17:53 - normal button
17:54 - and it's here
17:56 - and now
17:57 - we realize that we actually want the
17:59 - color of the
18:00 - button to be blue how do we change it we
18:03 - go to the master element
18:05 - click
18:06 - and we basically i'm going to move my
18:08 - profile here a bit and we change its
18:10 - color to blue
18:13 - and then you realize all the other
18:16 - buttons that actually were the children
18:18 - of this master element also change so
18:21 - this makes it very easy for you to make
18:23 - changes yet it has a problem and
18:27 - variants came to rescue for this problem
18:29 - the problem is what if you want to use
18:32 - the blue color
18:34 - and the brown color so in 25 screens of
18:38 - your apps you are using the color blue
18:40 - in 30 of them you are using the color
18:42 - brown
18:44 - how
18:45 - do you make that work in a rigid format
18:48 - of a component where you only have one
18:50 - master element
18:52 - and that's where the variants come into
18:54 - play
18:59 - and what you do is you click on your
19:02 - component and to use variance you have
19:04 - to have a component simple frame won't
19:06 - work
19:07 - and you click on this plus sign for
19:09 - variance
19:10 - now what a variant is basically it's a
19:13 - variation of the same element so we are
19:16 - still designing a button but depending
19:19 - on the properties we have
19:21 - we can actually make it look different
19:23 - and for our case the property will be
19:26 - color because it we are trying to
19:29 - basically change the color from brown to
19:31 - blue so the property of the variants is
19:35 - color
19:37 - now the first button i wanted to be
19:40 - color blue so i'm going to give it the
19:42 - value for the color property blue
19:44 - and the second one
19:46 - i'm going to give it
19:48 - brown
19:50 - and i'm gonna make it go brown here
19:54 - let's go a bit
19:56 - maybe
19:57 - maybe red yeah i like the red better
19:59 - actually let's do red
20:02 - who cares about brown red okay so now we
20:07 - actually have a button with two
20:09 - different variations it can have the
20:11 - color blue it can have the color red
20:14 - and
20:15 - let's just before we go on i'm gonna
20:17 - show you an error type where what would
20:20 - happen if we also name this the same
20:22 - value blue
20:24 - now then pigment gives you a problem
20:26 - because
20:27 - if you have the same values for the two
20:30 - different variations figma doesn't know
20:32 - which one to show it to to you when you
20:34 - are actually fetching it
20:36 - so you want to make sure that each
20:38 - combination of properties and values
20:41 - mapped to a single
20:43 - variant maybe a single variation of that
20:46 - element so this has to be red it can't
20:48 - be the same
20:50 - and what you do to actually get it is
20:54 - you go to the assets panel again and you
20:57 - fetch it just like you fetch a component
21:00 - but now on the right side here you can
21:02 - pick it and if you pick red
21:04 - it's red
21:06 - and let's copy and paste it here
21:08 - and if you pick it blue
21:10 - it's blue
21:11 - look at that and that is the basics of
21:14 - what we are going to use today we are
21:16 - going to use throughout this whole
21:18 - tutorial frames auto layers components
21:21 - and variants
21:22 - and if you are just new to this make
21:24 - sure you go to the homework practice
21:27 - file in the description just like i said
21:29 - in the previous video
21:31 - and
21:32 - that might help you solidify your
21:33 - knowledge but if you feel bold or you're
21:36 - already comfortable with what i just
21:38 - talked about
21:39 - let's actually begin designing
21:45 - and in this video i'm going to show you
21:47 - how to create type system
21:49 - basically we are using throughout this
21:52 - let me actually go to a screen here
21:54 - let me zoom in
21:56 - let me go shift to zoom in yep so
21:59 - throughout this app we are actually
22:01 - using a single font called sf pro text
22:05 - now
22:05 - if you are using if you have a macbook
22:07 - you can use sf pro if you're on windows
22:09 - you can use sf pro text and again i will
22:13 - add in the description how to download
22:15 - this font if you are in windows if you
22:17 - are a mac user it should already be
22:19 - pre-installed when you bought your
22:22 - computer or your laptop so while we are
22:24 - using only one font
22:27 - we are using it for different sizes and
22:30 - one thing you want to do if you are
22:32 - going to create a scalable application
22:34 - is you want to create and determine your
22:36 - type system early on so in order to do
22:39 - that i'm gonna press on frame to create
22:41 - a new frame
22:43 - and i'm gonna name this type system
22:47 - and i'm gonna move my profile again to
22:49 - here
22:50 - i always forget this guys
22:52 - so
22:53 - in here what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
22:55 - have
22:56 - i'm gonna press on t
22:59 - for
23:00 - this is a text basically i am gonna
23:04 - this is gonna be my mainframe and i'm
23:05 - gonna come back to check which kind of a
23:08 - type can i use but then once we add all
23:11 - the different versions of the type we
23:13 - are going to use i am actually gonna
23:15 - create a half i'm gonna show you how to
23:17 - create a type system on figma so you
23:19 - never have to visit this frame ever
23:22 - again so let's begin what i'm gonna do
23:24 - is i'm gonna copy this
23:29 - and i'm gonna copy this as again and i'm
23:32 - gonna copy this again and you're gonna
23:34 - have basically in this app two different
23:36 - versions we are gonna have
23:38 - 12 pixel 15 pixel 17 pixel and 34 pixel
23:42 - and we will have this for regular and
23:45 - bold that's all the type versions that
23:47 - we are using so
23:49 - i'm gonna have this as my h1 meaning
23:52 - title text
23:53 - this is gonna be my title text
23:58 - and this is gonna be my second header so
24:01 - each
24:02 - one text sorry h2 text
24:06 - my bad so sub header i think subheader
24:09 - would be a better
24:11 - text and this is going to be 17 pixels
24:17 - and 15 pixels is going to be my body
24:20 - text
24:22 - so this is going to be the
24:24 - body text
24:27 - and i'm going to also automate this as
24:29 - well
24:31 - and it then 12 pixel will be my smallest
24:34 - text so span text
24:36 - i'm gonna call the span text and in
24:38 - mobile 12 pixels is usually the smallest
24:41 - you want to go
24:42 - for like icon labelization in ios you
24:45 - can go 10 pixel but i wouldn't recommend
24:47 - going below 12 pixel it's very hard to
24:51 - read so this is the bolded version so
24:53 - you can see each element here is bold
24:56 - so now what i'm gonna do
24:59 - is i am also gonna
25:01 - select all of these and copy and paste
25:04 - to the right side
25:05 - here
25:07 - and these all of these will be the
25:09 - regular version so they will be the
25:12 - regular version
25:15 - oh yeah sorry my bad i was trying to
25:18 - change the type this will be the regular
25:21 - version here
25:22 - boom
25:23 - okay
25:24 - so now that we actually have our types
25:29 - every type we are going to use is here
25:32 - we can actually add them to figma as a
25:34 - type system so to do that i am going to
25:37 - go over each type here
25:38 - right corner style so i can add them as
25:41 - a style and i can click click on this
25:44 - and i'm gonna be here header
25:48 - slash
25:50 - regular
25:54 - uh
25:55 - my bad this one is the bold one right
25:58 - yes
25:58 - this this one is the bold one i have to
26:00 - edit ah
26:01 - ah matt you are making mistakes
26:04 - ah
26:05 - and that happens guys we all make
26:06 - mistakes so this is the
26:09 - bold one
26:10 - and i'm gonna add this to be
26:13 - header
26:16 - regular
26:18 - and i'm gonna add this one as a sub
26:21 - header
26:24 - bold
26:27 - and i'm gonna add the
26:28 - yep
26:30 - another bold and as you guessed it
26:35 - sub header
26:42 - and this one will be body
26:50 - bold and this one will be
26:55 - body
26:56 - regular now if you are asking why am i
26:59 - adding a slash
27:03 - and the reason for that is
27:06 - i have to move my profile here i'm going
27:08 - to move myself here
27:09 - once you use a slash figma understands
27:12 - that you are actually
27:14 - basically nesting certain elements so
27:16 - once i do header slash figma creates a
27:19 - basically a title named header and puts
27:21 - everything inside that i had like a bold
27:23 - regular so this is much more easier to
27:26 - read for our eyes
27:28 - so the body is done next will be the
27:29 - span so i'm gonna do the same here so
27:33 - span as you guessed it slash
27:37 - bold
27:39 - and
27:40 - i'm gonna do the same for this one
27:43 - click on the plus span
27:46 - regular
27:48 - perfect
27:50 - and i'm just gonna give it a check here
27:52 - and now that we have this this is what
27:54 - we can then i'm gonna show you how we
27:55 - can use this a bit
27:57 - so if we were to have a text here let's
27:58 - say i am a text we can actually and
28:01 - let's move this to somewhere else like
28:03 - our
28:04 - iphone screen here and these screens
28:06 - will be deleted shortly but this is just
28:08 - to prove the point of why this is useful
28:10 - i can
28:11 - change its styles here without ever
28:14 - going to copy paste from here this is
28:16 - almost like how we learned how to use
28:18 - variants almost like a variance for
28:21 - type but figma made it very easy for the
28:23 - type system to do
28:25 - to
28:26 - actually have this very neat in the
28:28 - sidebar here it's actually very neat and
28:31 - now that we are done with the type
28:34 - we are going to move to do this how to
28:36 - create the style design system for the
28:39 - color palette
28:44 - all right so let's create our color
28:47 - system
28:48 - so to do this i'm going to go the same
28:50 - thing i'm going to create a frame by
28:52 - actually click tapping the keyboard
28:55 - shortcut f
28:56 - so i'm going to draw this out
28:59 - and i'm going to name this
29:01 - color system
29:03 - and what i'm going to do is basically i
29:06 - am going to
29:08 - what this will have is basically every
29:10 - variation of colors we will have in this
29:13 - app from this blue and you can
29:16 - see that we have different shades of
29:18 - blue right so i'm just going to zoom in
29:20 - here a bit but this is blue this is blue
29:23 - we have white i believe
29:25 - around
29:26 - if you have a good eye you can tell this
29:28 - is also some sort of a blue color
29:31 - it looks black but it is also blue
29:34 - and
29:35 - we have let's say a gray color here
29:38 - and the background of the screens for
29:41 - this app that i designed aren't actually
29:43 - completely white
29:45 - they are like 98 white so that will be
29:48 - added and those are the colors we are
29:50 - gonna add so one thing we don't want to
29:52 - do again is that we are trying to
29:54 - minimize as much as how much copying and
29:56 - pasting we will do for two reasons first
29:59 - of all copying and pasting is very very
30:01 - hard and time consuming especially if
30:04 - your app scales and becomes instead of a
30:06 - 12 screen app which is here into 100
30:09 - screen app the second is it is error
30:11 - prone you might have copied and pasted
30:13 - the wrong variation of an element you
30:15 - might have copied and pasted wrong color
30:17 - but if you have a system that you can
30:20 - follow step by step you will also make
30:23 - less mistakes and it will save you time
30:25 - so let's go so i'm going to create what
30:27 - i'm going to do here is i'm going to
30:28 - press o to actually draw circles
30:31 - and i'm going to make this like 120
30:34 - pixels
30:35 - 120 pixels and these are going to hold
30:38 - my colors
30:39 - and i'm gonna copy and paste this around
30:44 - i'm gonna copy and paste it around
30:46 - yep four times
30:48 - now i'm gonna pick all of these
30:51 - i'm gonna copy and paste this complete
30:54 - set of row
30:56 - and that is pretty good okay
31:00 - so now what we i'm going to do is i am
31:02 - going to begin by the color blue
31:05 - and the i'm going to go from 100 to 400
31:08 - 100 signals that it's actually a very
31:11 - light color and for as the number goes
31:14 - up it means that the color is getting
31:15 - darker and darker so for this blue what
31:18 - we will have is i'm gonna pick the
31:20 - colorful tool and to do that the window
31:22 - shortcut is i
31:25 - and i'm gonna do this
31:27 - i'm gonna go to the second color
31:30 - and i think the second one here is
31:35 - 200 is this one this blue inside the
31:38 - stepper
31:40 - so i think that one so clicking on that
31:43 - one is a bit difficult but i think i can
31:46 - do this guys ready
31:48 - i am so happy for that magnifier tool
31:52 - and i think my just bugged out
31:56 - yep that's your 200
31:58 - and the 300 is the profile color here so
32:02 - the icon color when it's not selected
32:06 - that has to be zoomed out a bit more
32:09 - i think i'm i think i'm just gonna
32:12 - copy the color here the
32:14 - tool is it's very small so i would make
32:16 - a mistake so i'm just going to copy and
32:18 - paste here
32:20 - and the 400 is actually the text color
32:24 - that i use i'm going to copy and paste
32:26 - this as well
32:29 - now
32:30 - basically each row will serve as one
32:33 - type of a color
32:35 - so the blue is gone
32:38 - what else can we have the blue is gone
32:41 - we will have variations of white so two
32:44 - variations of white
32:46 - so i'm gonna move this and i think we
32:48 - will have a gray somewhere so i think we
32:51 - will have one gray
32:53 - so for variations of white let's tank
32:55 - this through first variation is the
32:58 - input one so input color there is so i'm
33:01 - gonna do is i'm gonna click on my
33:03 - element and i want to
33:05 - have the color fill i'm gonna press i
33:07 - and i'm gonna go here press again
33:10 - that's the
33:11 - oh that is just white okay
33:14 - and then i'm gonna press i and then i'm
33:15 - gonna go copy the background and that's
33:18 - the second one
33:20 - so
33:21 - and for the gray we only have the gray
33:23 - here
33:25 - for the disabled buttons
33:28 - and that is your gray i don't think it
33:30 - copied
33:32 - let's see
33:34 - yes now it copied and white is pretty
33:36 - hard to see so what i'm going to do is
33:38 - i'm going to give this frame a whole
33:40 - dark background because we can't see the
33:42 - white colors i i realize that so i'm
33:44 - going to give it a black color here now
33:46 - we can see all the colors
33:48 - and now that we have this
33:51 - what we can do is i'm gonna go through
33:53 - the same process now at this point i
33:55 - could use a plug-in to actually generate
33:58 - these styles for me but i'm assuming
34:00 - some of you have never done this kind of
34:02 - work and it's beneficial for you to see
34:04 - me on how to do this step by step so i'm
34:06 - going to take the long route and i'm
34:08 - actually going to do the same as what we
34:09 - did in the when we were trying to
34:11 - systematize the type settings so i'm
34:13 - going to
34:15 - click on this and i'm going to click on
34:17 - this style
34:18 - icon there and i'm going to click on the
34:20 - add
34:21 - and i'm going to write blue and as you
34:23 - guessed it slash
34:25 - and i'm going to say 100
34:29 - and i'm going to do this for
34:31 - almost all of them
34:33 - and then 200
34:37 - and
34:39 - this is the part of
34:41 - when you really
34:42 - are happy that you have plugins
34:44 - available to you that will automatically
34:47 - do this for you but
34:49 - it's good to
34:51 - sometimes do it by yourself
34:53 - so we again did the slash so we can
34:55 - actually see them roll by row
34:57 - and this is gonna be your
35:00 - one so this is gonna be the white
35:01 - hundreds
35:03 - right
35:04 - hundred
35:06 - and this is gonna be the
35:08 - y200
35:11 - and 200
35:14 - and let's see this is gonna be the
35:19 - gray
35:22 - 100 okay
35:24 - and let's see how it works right now i'm
35:27 - gonna go on to the screen again i'm
35:29 - gonna draw my rectangle on this iphone
35:31 - and i'm gonna see if i can change its
35:33 - styles and boom i'm gonna move my
35:35 - profile here and yeah just like our type
35:37 - system our color system works it's
35:39 - easily scannable it's very easy to skim
35:42 - and i'm pretty happy with it all right
35:44 - so now that we have actually done the
35:47 - color styles now we are going to move to
35:49 - the icons we are going to create the
35:51 - icon set that we will use for this
35:53 - project in the next video
35:59 - all right so let's actually begin
36:01 - fetching our icon set now we are not
36:04 - going to be creating all these icons
36:06 - from scratch so what i did is actually i
36:09 - created a frame called icon set and i
36:11 - wrote down all the icons we need and you
36:14 - can see the tenth one is bolded and
36:16 - there's a reason why it's pulled just
36:18 - wait for a bait give me a minute i will
36:20 - explain now what i want to do now is i
36:22 - am going to actually use a plugin to
36:24 - fetch most of these icons and i'm
36:26 - actually going to use two plugins the
36:28 - first line i'm going to actually use the
36:30 - plugin called feather icons
36:32 - and the second one the last one the
36:34 - store the visa icon i'm gonna use the
36:36 - plugin called iconify now this is very
36:40 - important and i'm gonna show you how to
36:42 - actually install both of these plugins
36:44 - so in the future you can also have a
36:47 - starting icon set that you can use on
36:49 - your own to save you time for your
36:51 - designs and also it's a good practice to
36:53 - learn how to create your work setup
36:55 - where you actually can have the plugins
36:57 - that you need to fasten your work so
37:00 - let's install the plugins to install i
37:02 - want you to go to click on the main menu
37:05 - plugins and i want you to go to bottom
37:08 - here and say bros plugins in community
37:10 - once you see the screen i want you to
37:13 - type feather icons this is the first
37:15 - plugin we will download and i want you
37:17 - to filter with the plugins here and i
37:19 - want you to click on install for this
37:21 - plugin once that is installed i want you
37:23 - to write here iconify and i want you to
37:26 - install this one as well now if both of
37:28 - these are installed now you can actually
37:31 - download these icons and i am not going
37:34 - to go over the process of actually using
37:36 - the plugin what i will do is basically
37:38 - i'm gonna go to the feather icons the
37:41 - first plugin we installed and i'm gonna
37:43 - basically install all these nine icons
37:46 - by fetching it here it's gonna be a bit
37:48 - boring so i'm gonna actually speed
37:50 - things up in the video level so that's
37:52 - why all these texts are there and you
37:54 - can also do this on your time and let's
37:57 - go
38:18 - and for the last icon i'm gonna for the
38:20 - visa i'm gonna go plugins
38:22 - and instead of going through
38:24 - feather icons i'm gonna go for iconify
38:27 - and i'm gonna look for visa
38:30 - and i'm gonna pick this one
38:34 - yeah i'm gonna put this here and you can
38:37 - see all of these icons are actually i'm
38:40 - gonna select all again
38:43 - and i'm gonna
38:44 - [Music]
38:45 - basically create a
38:48 - i'm gonna select all
38:50 - it should show me
38:53 - i think figma is backing up because it
38:55 - should show me a spacing option as a
38:57 - shortcut
38:59 - yep there you are and i'm gonna have
39:01 - this as maybe 24 that's better and
39:04 - they're all spaced well right now and
39:07 - one thing i'm making sure is the
39:09 - bounding box that each icon has is 24 to
39:12 - 24. the inside icon size doesn't matter
39:15 - as long as it doesn't go out of bonds
39:17 - but for your styling knees it's very
39:19 - important that each icon has the same
39:22 - width and height of a surrounding box
39:25 - now you will see in the design some of
39:27 - the content meaning the actual
39:30 - vectors might have different sizes than
39:32 - the other icons but that's okay as long
39:34 - as the bounding box is the same we will
39:37 - make it work so now that the icon set is
39:39 - actually created let's move on to the
39:43 - actually
39:44 - creating your first variations for our
39:47 - first login and sign up screens
39:49 - so before we actually move on to
39:53 - the looking at the up and login screens
39:56 - i forgot to do one thing in our icon set
39:59 - so vial and i'm going to zoom with the
40:02 - shift 2 here while you actually might
40:05 - have get got the icons from the plugins
40:08 - we use fedora icons and iconify one
40:10 - thing i forgot was to actually make each
40:13 - icon a component so we would actually be
40:15 - eligible to use them from the asset spat
40:18 - assets panel and the main benefit for
40:20 - that is is you do not want to be coming
40:22 - back to the screen to copy and paste
40:24 - icons all the time that takes a lot of
40:27 - time it's much easier to use the assets
40:29 - panel and just drag and drop so let's do
40:32 - that so i'm going to go to layers and
40:34 - i'm going to go
40:35 - on the left side i am just gonna
40:38 - go through the i'm inside the icon set
40:40 - frame i am
40:42 - with shift i am mass selecting each icon
40:46 - and then what i'm gonna do is i am going
40:49 - to make these a component
40:52 - and
40:53 - let's see
40:57 - ah
40:58 - yeah thingama did not have that shortcut
41:00 - did it so that just created the combo
41:03 - mess so we have to go through the old
41:05 - way i'm just gonna do the ctrl alt k for
41:09 - each of these
41:10 - and that is boring
41:13 - i don't know if this has a shortcut or
41:15 - not i thought it would
41:17 - it didn't and it's crushed my dreams but
41:20 - it happens so
41:23 - let's do that
41:25 - so now each icon is actually a component
41:28 - and we can actually reach them from here
41:32 - and that is very handy
41:38 - so let's move now
41:40 - into the sign up screen login screen
41:42 - let's create our first variant so i want
41:45 - you to take a look at this two screen
41:47 - and i want you to basically
41:50 - ask yourself two questions
41:52 - what elements to visual look alike and
41:55 - of these elements are they also
41:57 - logically alike
41:59 - what do i mean by this so when i am
42:01 - actually looking at the screen what i
42:03 - want to do is i want to systematize
42:05 - patternize almost everything so i do not
42:08 - do unnecessary work because in a
42:10 - production level design like i said
42:12 - previously you are not going to be
42:14 - working with 12 screens we are going to
42:16 - be working with 100 and if it's a web
42:18 - app that is actually responsive it might
42:20 - be 300. so you really want to minimize
42:22 - your work and to do that we are looking
42:25 - to actually create the variance well how
42:28 - do we know which elements belong
42:29 - together by answering those two
42:32 - questions i said which elements do
42:33 - visually look alike and for me right now
42:36 - all these rectangles look alike
42:39 - including the button but then i ask
42:41 - myself which of these elements are
42:43 - logically alike and i can justify saying
42:46 - the input text field is
42:49 - logically alike with the email text
42:51 - input and the password is also because
42:53 - they are all input text they are
42:56 - basically all input fields but a button
42:59 - is a button it has a different logical
43:01 - functionality it is used to actually
43:03 - have an action accomplished it doesn't
43:05 - take an input so we are going to create
43:09 - s
43:09 - variants for the input field and it will
43:13 - have three variants
43:14 - the name
43:15 - the email and the password and that's
43:18 - how we decide things we answer those two
43:20 - questions i'm gonna press on f to create
43:23 - a frame
43:25 - and i really want this to have a
43:26 - different
43:28 - background color because i'm going to
43:30 - use a lot of
43:32 - light colors i wanted to have a dark
43:33 - color like the color palette and let's
43:36 - press on f to create our frame and i
43:39 - think the width of that is 325
43:42 - what's the margin there 24 26 okay so
43:46 - ahmed made a mistake to pass me
43:48 - it should probably be
43:50 - 327 so it would have 24 pixels left and
43:53 - right on a iphone device so 327 pixels
43:57 - 48 pixels for height and i'm gonna fill
43:59 - this i'm gonna move my profile image
44:02 - here i'm gonna fill this with the our
44:05 - color style which are now here based on
44:08 - our previous video i'm gonna pick the
44:10 - 100
44:12 - i'm going to add this a border radius
44:14 - because if you look this
44:17 - input all of these inputs have a border
44:19 - radius of 8
44:20 - so i'm gonna add
44:22 - eight here and i'm gonna give it a drop
44:25 - shadow of
44:27 - four or sixteen
44:29 - and probably ten pixels and you probably
44:31 - cannot tell how the drop shadow works
44:34 - there because the background is what
44:36 - would you say black but if it was white
44:39 - this is how the drop shadow would work
44:41 - and let's go to the previous i wanna
44:43 - under the change boom so our frame is
44:46 - good i'm gonna go back to there our
44:48 - frame is good i'm going to rename this
44:50 - as input and i'm going to rename the
44:52 - parent as inputs
44:54 - so it needs now a text
44:58 - for the placeholder text i'm going to
44:59 - write json mamoa i'm doing the text
45:02 - input field and i'm gonna also because
45:06 - we have the type system i'm gonna go and
45:09 - say this can be a regular auto regular
45:12 - body and that's pretty good and i'm
45:13 - gonna make this out of it
45:15 - and i want to basically align this like
45:18 - 12 pixels maybe yeah that looks pretty
45:21 - good and so aligning text vertically is
45:24 - always hard because even if you use
45:27 - autofit there is always bottom and top
45:30 - spacing so in this one you have a three
45:32 - three and a half pixel on top of the j
45:35 - and four pixel on the bottom so your
45:36 - center when you are centering if those
45:39 - two distances are farther apart you're
45:40 - not actually centering the text because
45:43 - the spacing is correct so this should be
45:45 - maybe a bit
45:47 - low
45:48 - but it shouldn't be complete 15 it
45:50 - should have
45:51 - maybe 14 yeah that's how it goes
45:55 - that's a bit better
45:56 - and the color of it should probably not
45:59 - be black but the gray
46:02 - that's perfect
46:04 - so now
46:05 - now that we have our input frame we have
46:08 - to make it a component so that we can
46:10 - actually have eligibility for the
46:12 - variance functionality so to make a
46:15 - component the shortcut on windows is
46:17 - ctrl alt k
46:19 - and now i have a component and i'm going
46:21 - to make this a variant by clicking on
46:23 - this plus button boom and my second
46:26 - variant will probably be the email one
46:28 - so it would be jason at
46:30 - hotmail
46:32 - maybe x
46:34 - jason
46:35 - hotmail.com
46:38 - you know if we have to make this
46:41 - look production level
46:44 - and now i have two
46:46 - examples two variants of the input field
46:48 - now what should my property name be and
46:52 - to answer this to write this to answer
46:54 - this very simply you should ask yourself
46:56 - what is the attribute that i am actually
46:59 - judging the difference of the variance
47:02 - meaning what separates the variant here
47:04 - what separates an input field from
47:06 - another and in our case it's type if the
47:08 - input type is password it will look a
47:12 - certain way if input type is email it
47:14 - will look a certain way so for this one
47:17 - the type and it will be
47:19 - text
47:21 - for this one it will be email
47:25 - and we should add a third one and this
47:27 - is the most complex one
47:29 - it should be the password one and i'm
47:31 - gonna write this password
47:33 - and it has actually an
47:36 - icon at the end and it doesn't have a
47:39 - it has the eye icon so you can actually
47:41 - hide and show the password so i'm going
47:43 - to delete the text it doesn't have a
47:44 - text what it does have is the hidden
47:46 - password right now so i'm going to press
47:48 - o to create those hidden passwords
47:52 - and maybe eight
47:56 - awesome so those are my that's my circle
47:58 - and i want the circle to be like
48:01 - yeah
48:02 - dark blue
48:04 - and i'm clicking on alt to actually
48:07 - drag to duplicate
48:09 - and then
48:11 - i am gonna do one more time
48:14 - that's good
48:15 - and i'm gonna take a look out to see if
48:18 - this works and i think two works
48:21 - and i'm gonna select all of these to
48:23 - basically copy and paste
48:26 - so
48:28 - let's see
48:29 - that i'm gonna select all of them to
48:31 - basically
48:33 - determine their spacing if i zoom in a
48:35 - bit does things let me nope
48:37 - but i think they are equal space so what
48:39 - i'm gonna do is i'm gonna group these
48:42 - circles group selection
48:44 - i'm gonna say
48:46 - password text
48:49 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
48:51 - going to add i'm going to make sure this
48:53 - is aligned well
48:55 - is it by 12
48:57 - oh
48:58 - what am i
48:59 - clicking it's 12 so it matches the
49:02 - alignment of the email field and now i
49:05 - am going to add the
49:09 - eye icon i'm going to my assets icon set
49:13 - and i am going to drop the
49:17 - okay
49:19 - i think
49:20 - we didn't i haven't got the eye icon
49:23 - let's see
49:25 - if i didn't
49:26 - yeah oh i'm okay guys i think i skipped
49:29 - it okay so i forgot to make the
49:31 - component
49:33 - so let me go back
49:36 - so now i'm gonna select my frame
49:39 - i'm gonna drop my eye right there
49:42 - go to my layers my eye is there perfect
49:46 - and i want it to be as away as possible
49:49 - as 12 pixels
49:52 - maybe one two
49:56 - and what's it's yeah i think that looks
49:59 - pretty good i think that looks pretty
50:01 - good
50:02 - one thing i want to make sure is this
50:05 - one
50:06 - two pixels i want it to be one pixel i
50:09 - want the circle to be one pixel as well
50:11 - and i want the whole eyes color to be
50:15 - dark blue
50:17 - we don't use black okay
50:19 - and
50:20 - that one works pretty good one looks
50:23 - pretty good i think also so this one is
50:26 - the visible i think we got the wrong eye
50:29 - icon so
50:30 - in this one what we have is that the
50:33 - password is invisible so that's the
50:35 - wrong eye icon so i have to go back now
50:37 - and okay
50:38 - these mistakes happen they will not
50:40 - deter us so we have to install let me
50:42 - quickly install the other
50:45 - eye icon here
50:49 - right there
50:50 - yep let me put it
50:53 - in the icon set
50:55 - let me put it here
50:58 - let me make it a component
51:01 - and let me oh that's too much
51:06 - let me zoom it zoom out
51:09 - and i'm going back to my inputs
51:12 - come on third time is the charm delete
51:15 - that eye icon
51:17 - click on the
51:19 - password input go to assets get the eye
51:22 - that is actually invisible
51:25 - select its color to be dark blue
51:29 - and we want it to have a stroke of one
51:32 - pixel
51:37 - and also we want to
51:41 - let's see if we what's the distance yeah
51:44 - we wanna give it
51:48 - what is it now 15 12 and then we want
51:52 - this to be 12 also and boom
51:55 - yeah now it works all right so now that
51:59 - so how this is gonna be used again is
52:02 - now that we can go to assets and we can
52:05 - have an inputs variant here like you can
52:07 - see and if i were to drop one here i can
52:10 - pick its version
52:11 - if we pick password this test if you
52:13 - pick email it's this so now that the
52:15 - inputs is done
52:17 - now we can i zoomed out too much now we
52:20 - can focus on the sign
52:26 - all right so now that we are done with
52:28 - the inputs let's begin creating the
52:31 - variants for the
52:33 - large buttons which are the sign up
52:35 - login buttons for our signing and login
52:38 - screens but if you look at the other
52:40 - parts of the app as well we can see we
52:42 - are using the same button for booking
52:44 - and we also have a different state of
52:47 - the button which is the same width and
52:49 - height but it's great so it's disabled
52:51 - and one thing one more thing i want to
52:54 - take your attention is the label in each
52:56 - of these meaning label on each of these
52:59 - large buttons is some of them is login
53:02 - sign up book knob go to checkout the bit
53:05 - of the
53:06 - actual element doesn't change but the
53:09 - size of the label is changing so that
53:12 - means we actually have to use auto
53:15 - layout to accomplish this functionality
53:18 - so let's get cracking so to create a
53:20 - frame again you know this now i'm gonna
53:22 - press f
53:24 - and
53:26 - i'm gonna name this as buttons and the
53:29 - reason i'm doing these all in different
53:32 - frames is because as you can see
53:35 - i actually the more type the more i
53:38 - separate each component apart i will
53:41 - have easier access in assets panel
53:44 - because they will be much more organized
53:46 - so in the buttons what i want to do is
53:49 - it also i'm going to create click on f
53:52 - again tap on f again and i'm going to
53:54 - set this with the 327.48
53:57 - i'm gonna change the
54:00 - color of the buttons frame to match
54:04 - the dark one here
54:05 - and
54:07 - i'm gonna add a fill of white there but
54:10 - my white is actually specified with 100
54:13 - same as what we went through for the
54:15 - input fields it's gonna have eight pixel
54:17 - of radius
54:18 - and it will also have a drop shadow of
54:21 - four four 16 pixels blur and 10 pixel
54:25 - for the
54:27 - actual drop shadows color
54:29 - up for its opacity so now that we have
54:32 - this as the starting point i am going up
54:35 - and one thing i realized it is different
54:38 - for the button is it's actually the blue
54:40 - color so i'm going to change it to here
54:42 - the initial blue
54:44 - boom it also has a label just like the
54:47 - input field but
54:49 - the label is centered and that's
54:51 - important
54:52 - so it will be like login so the label is
54:55 - centered
54:56 - and it is also bolded so in here in the
55:01 - input field the labels were left aligned
55:03 - but also regular
55:05 - but for the buttons it is centered with
55:08 - bolded so they are also bold not regular
55:10 - so i'm gonna pick my text of
55:15 - basically bold 15 which is pretty good
55:19 - and to actually accomplish the centering
55:22 - i am actually going to use auto layout
55:24 - and one thing i want to do is i don't
55:26 - want it to hug content i want it to
55:28 - fixed width
55:29 - and height and there's a reason for this
55:33 - so fixed center
55:36 - fixed center
55:37 - the reason is so i'm gonna show you two
55:40 - ways of this okay so i'm gonna actually
55:42 - drag another one so
55:45 - so let's say how contact hunt content so
55:49 - in this situation if i were to actually
55:52 - add new text
55:56 - you can see the the
55:58 - content of the background also scales
56:01 - but that is not what we have throughout
56:02 - the application because despite the
56:04 - changes of the label size horizontally
56:07 - width and height of the background of
56:10 - the button stays the same buttons width
56:13 - and height stay the same and that means
56:15 - it has a fixed return height but the
56:17 - text is free to grow as slight as it can
56:20 - so that's why we are using fixed instead
56:23 - of hug so now that we are here
56:26 - i i can show you now i can make this
56:28 - grow
56:30 - and the the
56:32 - what would you say rectangle itself will
56:34 - not resize and that is the key here so
56:38 - now i have this what i will actually do
56:42 - is that i am gonna make this a component
56:45 - so that i can make then i have a variant
56:47 - so i'm gonna click on ctrl alt k to make
56:51 - it a component and i'm gonna name it
56:53 - large button
56:57 - and i am going to give it a variant
56:59 - and what should the variant be based off
57:02 - is again
57:03 - the same question
57:05 - and again what attribute are we trying
57:07 - to differentiate we know the key
57:09 - attribute we have right now is that if
57:12 - the button is primary it's going to have
57:14 - the blue background color and if it's a
57:16 - secondary or
57:18 - would you say if the button is active it
57:21 - will have a blue color if it's not
57:23 - active it will have a gray color meaning
57:25 - it will be disabled you won't be able to
57:27 - tap it but we can also have another
57:29 - property here that is important such as
57:32 - we can have and in this application for
57:34 - large buttons like this we don't have it
57:36 - but we can also have a secondary button
57:38 - or a tertiary button meaning that
57:41 - what would happen if we were to show a
57:44 - button here like this look at the cancel
57:46 - button here for the small buttons unlike
57:49 - the primary button here where the button
57:51 - is filled and it gets your attention a
57:53 - secondary button is created with the
57:55 - fill removed but only added in the
57:57 - strokes so i think i will have that in
58:00 - the large button just in case in the
58:02 - future we might need it so i'm gonna
58:04 - have two properties the first property
58:07 - and again is
58:09 - active is it active or not
58:12 - and to add the second property i'm
58:14 - clicking on the more options icon i
58:16 - click on add new property
58:18 - and then the
58:20 - moment a bit of buggy here and the
58:23 - second property will be
58:27 - priority
58:31 - and i'm gonna zoom in so what i'm going
58:33 - to now do is i'm going to the first
58:35 - button and i'm going to say active
58:38 - yes
58:39 - priority primary
58:42 - the second button is also going to be
58:45 - primary
58:46 - but it won't be active
58:48 - and when it's not active we want its
58:50 - background color to be
58:52 - grayed and we want the color of here to
58:56 - be blue
58:58 - and i don't want this to have a complete
58:59 - white that's my mistake we have to use
59:01 - our color system wherever we can
59:04 - and so now we have two primary buttons
59:07 - one is active one is not active and i
59:09 - want a third one just in case that's too
59:11 - much zooming in i want a third one just
59:14 - in case here
59:15 - gonna zoom out third one to be secondary
59:18 - button but active
59:20 - so what that means is it is active but
59:22 - it is secondary and finger is giving me
59:25 - an error because
59:26 - it cannot have the same values as the
59:28 - first one so now what i'm gonna do is
59:30 - i'm gonna click on shift x
59:32 - to switch stroke and fill properties
59:36 - and i am also going to give this
59:39 - the color
59:41 - blue there we go and that looks pretty
59:44 - good so those are our three versions of
59:47 - our colors and yeah so those are our
59:49 - buttons that we can now play with right
59:53 - just before we
59:54 - go on board looking at sign up screen
59:56 - began designing them i haven't mentioned
59:59 - here so in the previous video we did the
60:01 - button variations and one thing that
60:04 - your test of adding new text here might
60:07 - fail so here right now it is not
60:10 - centering the text even though we set it
60:13 - as fixed width and height because you
60:16 - actually have to click here to actually
60:20 - select where do you want the position of
60:22 - the content p and if you select center
60:24 - no matter what you add should actually
60:26 - be recentered alone and that is how it
60:29 - works and what i'm going to do now is
60:31 - i'm going to do this for each of the
60:34 - variants i'm going to check if it's done
60:36 - here it's done if that here it's not
60:38 - done so i'm going to do that here all
60:40 - right so now all of them is done now we
60:43 - can actually move to the login and sign
60:45 - up screens
60:50 - all right so let's go
60:52 - so
60:54 - and this is my tea
60:59 - that tastes great okay so i i know
61:02 - you've been waiting for this part so
61:04 - let's begin so i wanted to show for our
61:06 - frame we actually have iphone 13 mini
61:09 - and when i'm going to do what i'm going
61:12 - to do is i'm going to just press f and
61:13 - i'm going to pick iphone 13 mini as well
61:16 - and i'm going to pick it around here and
61:18 - i want you to take a look at how to go
61:21 - on and design this so when i'm looking
61:24 - at this what i'm seeing is a basically a
61:26 - background image with some kind of an
61:28 - overlay on it we have the company logo
61:30 - we have the
61:32 - message if it's a signup it's welcome if
61:34 - it's a login space if i'll come back and
61:36 - we have some form to fill and at the end
61:39 - of the form we have the option for the
61:41 - user
61:42 - if they have an account already they can
61:44 - go to login if they don't they can come
61:46 - back it's a very simplistic sign in
61:49 - signup that doesn't have social media
61:51 - account signing options etc so let's go
61:55 - so one thing i'm gonna do is
61:57 - i'm gonna need the sign ups
61:59 - sign up screen
62:01 - copy
62:03 - and what i'm gonna do is i am gonna
62:05 - right click and i'm gonna go for the my
62:09 - plugin called on splash to actually find
62:12 - the background image and if you haven't
62:13 - already please install the plugin on
62:15 - splash here and what i'm gonna do is i'm
62:18 - gonna look for travel and let's see what
62:20 - we have let's see
62:23 - i'm looking for this particular image
62:25 - but i might not be able to find it but
62:28 - oh i did i'm lucky so i actually got the
62:31 - image um
62:33 - you know sign up screen and
62:37 - i think i did a mistake here where
62:40 - i think the image is added to the whole
62:43 - frame
62:44 - that's not what i want i want the image
62:46 - to be i want the image to be
62:50 - on top of a
62:52 - rectangle here i think that's what is
62:55 - happening so i think i have to get this
62:58 - overlay here yep i got this rectangle
63:01 - and this rectangle is what i'm going to
63:03 - fill the image as so plugins
63:06 - unsplash the same process maybe travel
63:09 - here
63:12 - go down go down go down here
63:16 - why is it
63:21 - okay
63:22 - now that is correct so
63:24 - sign up screen copy
63:26 - okay so this is correct now i'm going to
63:28 - add an overlay to the image and i'm
63:30 - probably going to add the overlay of
63:32 - blue
63:33 - meaning even in the overlay i'm going to
63:35 - use our primary colors and
63:38 - i am going to
63:40 - go back here
63:42 - get rid of that one
63:44 - i'm gonna add an overlay
63:46 - and i want the overlay to be basically
63:49 - our blue color which is
63:52 - basically i can do
63:54 - i'm gonna press i for its color
63:56 - and i'm gonna pick that
63:58 - and probably
64:00 - 20 px 20
64:02 - that's too little maybe 50 that's too
64:05 - much
64:06 - 40
64:07 - that's too blue so my blue guess was
64:10 - wrong maybe maybe it needs to be a
64:13 - darker color
64:15 - so maybe
64:17 - what we need to do is actually
64:20 - we might need to go and pick our
64:24 - dark blue color here
64:28 - and copy that
64:31 - remove that from our frame
64:34 - go to our image go to its overlay and
64:36 - paste it there
64:38 - that's how is eight i'm trying to find
64:41 - the maximum okay that's so i know eight
64:43 - is too high
64:44 - i know 20 is too low maybe 30 no
64:49 - 50. and what you can do is you can play
64:51 - with as you are holding shift you can go
64:53 - by 10
64:55 - and probably around 55
64:59 - or 45 is the answer i will go with 45
65:02 - for now and that's how you find the
65:06 - background
65:07 - overlay color and you basically find the
65:10 - up maximum and minimum bounce and just
65:12 - play around till your eye actually
65:15 - finds that okay this is the value that
65:17 - makes sense
65:19 - so now i am looking at i'm going to
65:20 - design the logo
65:23 - and i'm going to have a rectangle here
65:26 - and i am going to make this maybe 128
65:29 - pixels
65:31 - and what i want is to have it for it to
65:33 - have the initial blue color we have and
65:37 - one thing that is different for this one
65:39 - is that if you look at it
65:40 - it's a rectangle but only two of its
65:43 - corners are actually having a radius
65:46 - so that's exactly what i'm gonna do for
65:49 - this one and it's probably height is 40
65:51 - pixels as well
65:53 - yeah
65:54 - maybe 60
65:57 - but let's first add these edges
65:59 - let's write 16.
66:02 - do i edit to the right edge
66:06 - i think so yeah
66:07 - so maybe
66:09 - 64.
66:11 - yeah that works and 148 and to see if my
66:15 - height matches now and i could go the
66:19 - easy way here i think for i think 48
66:22 - would work
66:23 - maybe 64. i'm not sure
66:26 - let me check
66:28 - i think this has to be bigger a
66:32 - so for me to actually know i can just go
66:35 - and copy the values but i want to train
66:38 - my eye even though i designed the whole
66:39 - app previously by myself this is not a
66:41 - community project app what i will do is
66:44 - it's still difficult to redesign
66:46 - something what i will do is i will click
66:48 - on shift r which lets me access the
66:50 - ruler tool and i'm dragging a vertical
66:53 - straight line here okay so for the width
66:56 - i got it right so it is 188 pixels
67:00 - and his height looks all right now but i
67:03 - think the radius is
67:05 - for this one a lot more so maybe
67:07 - 32
67:09 - and 32
67:11 - that is correct i think that works and
67:14 - then i will add a text here
67:17 - and it will be activista
67:21 - and i want it to be autobit and
67:25 - i think this is the only text because it
67:28 - serves as a logo that we will not
67:30 - systematize with our type and what i
67:32 - want this to be is basically
67:35 - 36 pixels
67:38 - maybe 20 pixels
67:42 - and i want the second part of it to not
67:44 - be bold
67:46 - so i will have the second part selected
67:48 - i'm going to make it a regular and that
67:50 - works pretty good
67:53 - and now i'm going to align this
67:58 - let's see
68:00 - and i'm gonna check how far away it is
68:02 - and i think i want it to be 24
68:06 - and
68:08 - at 24 that is 42 so
68:12 - at 24 i want the right part to be also
68:14 - 24 so it's centered so i'm gonna get
68:16 - this to be
68:18 - maybe around here
68:22 - so maybe this can be 172.
68:27 - and
68:30 - and yeah i think that works
68:35 - pretty
68:36 - good maybe
68:42 - 17 and again
68:44 - aligning vertically is difficult because
68:46 - you can see top is six pixels but the
68:49 - bottom is eight so
68:51 - you you cannot trust the figma tool here
68:54 - should probably be 16 to 15 and that
68:57 - should work
68:59 - okay
69:01 - so
69:02 - let's move on and we can circle back to
69:04 - the logo again later so now what i'm
69:06 - gonna do is i am gonna have my text
69:08 - welcome
69:10 - and this will basically be my header so
69:13 - i'm gonna tweet it as a header
69:16 - and i'm gonna automate it
69:19 - and i'm gonna add the
69:21 - exclamation point there and then what
69:24 - i'm gonna do is
69:25 - i am basically going to think about
69:28 - all this big form assay frame
69:32 - and inside this frame i will have three
69:34 - groups
69:35 - name group email group password group
69:38 - and then button four groups maybe and
69:41 - the input groups will have a
69:43 - text label like your name and then the
69:45 - input
69:46 - and only the button will not have a text
69:48 - label above it so it's going to be
69:51 - like this so i'm going to go to my
69:54 - assets
69:55 - and i am going to go
69:58 - and fetch an input
70:00 - here all right
70:03 - and before going further i want to add a
70:05 - layout grid here so i can see things
70:07 - better
70:08 - and if you don't know what a layout grid
70:10 - is it basically allows you to
70:15 - 4
70:15 - 16
70:17 - it basically allows you to
70:19 - use vertical and if you want vertical
70:21 - horizontal layout of how your content
70:24 - should be placed at all screens it works
70:26 - very well so i'm gonna do that
70:30 - so i can no okay that's at 24 pixels
70:35 - go above and this is the name field so
70:38 - what i need now is the
70:40 - text label i'm gonna
70:43 - uh undo
70:45 - i'm gonna do zero
70:48 - gonna go here text
70:51 - i'm gonna say your name
70:53 - and this probably should not be but
70:56 - irregular but body bold
71:00 - so your name probably two dots here
71:04 - and i will have this auto bit as well
71:07 - and i'm gonna check how far away it is
71:09 - from the
71:12 - text input it's 22 pixels that's a lot
71:15 - so our left margin is 24 pixels so the
71:18 - spacing i'm going to do
71:20 - here is also important and how i'm going
71:24 - to base it is basically i know our left
71:26 - and right margins will be 24 pixels
71:29 - so
71:31 - i'm going to use the power of two for
71:32 - each margin we will have between
71:34 - different elements
71:36 - and when an element is actually related
71:39 - to a group of element meaning when you
71:41 - are thinking of a
71:43 - text input you cannot think of it
71:46 - without the label of your name so they
71:49 - actually should be closer to each other
71:52 - than they are closer to welcome so what
71:54 - i'm going to do is i am actually going
71:56 - to reduce this distance to
71:58 - 12
72:01 - and that should give me now 12. yep
72:03 - that's pretty good
72:06 - and i'm going to go to layers and i'm
72:08 - going to
72:09 - basically
72:11 - frame these two things and i'm going to
72:14 - write this as
72:16 - text
72:17 - input
72:18 - [Applause]
72:20 - and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
72:23 - copy
72:24 - this one
72:26 - and i'm gonna pick this one to be
72:28 - email
72:30 - and i'm gonna change this to your
72:33 - email very simple
72:35 - and i'm gonna
72:37 - do it the same manner where i'm gonna
72:39 - write this as email input
72:43 - and then i'm gonna
72:45 - drag this again and this will be as you
72:47 - guessed
72:49 - at probably
72:50 - your password
72:54 - and i'm gonna go here to my component
72:57 - and pick its variant to be password
73:00 - all right
73:02 - so
73:03 - now what i'm going to do is i am going
73:05 - to add my button which is
73:08 - our button is missing right now so i'm
73:10 - going to go to our assets i'm going to
73:12 - the button section i'm going to drag it
73:14 - here
73:17 - and i'm gonna go and make it go 24 and
73:20 - it should probably be 327 what's
73:22 - happening
73:24 - and
73:25 - that distance is too much maybe
73:29 - around 30
73:32 - and we can worry about the margins later
73:34 - but right now what i want to do is i
73:36 - want to group all these four things
73:41 - and that would let me use our auto
73:43 - layout function and how i'm i'm going to
73:45 - show you in a second how we are going to
73:46 - use it so i'm going to frame these
73:50 - four elements as well
73:52 - and i'm going to write them as the form
73:56 - sign up form
73:59 - and then i'm gonna add an auto layout
74:02 - and what auto layout does is it's gonna
74:05 - give me between each element so our
74:08 - name frame email frame password frame
74:11 - and our button
74:12 - i want us to have
74:15 - roughly
74:16 - 24 pixels
74:19 - and that's great
74:21 - and i'm gonna
74:24 - basically i really want to
74:28 - hide this
74:30 - yeah i don't want to see the red colors
74:32 - anymore i want to hide our layout so i'm
74:34 - going to click on alt shift 4
74:37 - to actually hide it
74:39 - that's good
74:41 - and now let's see how far away our
74:43 - welcome text to our form that's 43
74:46 - pixels so i'm gonna get it to be
74:48 - maybe 24
74:52 - and let's see how far i made that is 32
74:55 - i think 32 pixel there works well so
74:59 - from the logo to top that's 32 pixels
75:03 - from here that's 24 pixels
75:06 - and i'm gonna check with my ruler how
75:08 - everything is aligned to the left
75:12 - that is pretty good
75:15 - yeah
75:16 - i think this works so this is your sign
75:19 - up screen guys and the only thing
75:21 - missing right now is this text at the
75:23 - bottom and this should be my bad
75:26 - and this should also be sign up
75:30 - and let's add our text
75:33 - our basically gateway to the login
75:36 - screen that says tab here if you already
75:42 - have an account
75:45 - and i want this text to be autofit
75:48 - and i don't want it to be bold i want
75:50 - it's
75:51 - partially to be bold but
75:53 - and i wanted to start at the same
75:56 - left alignment which is 24 pixel for the
75:58 - x coordinates
76:00 - and i wanted to have because it's so
76:02 - related to the sign up button i want it
76:04 - to be like 12 pixels up
76:06 - most so maybe 12 pixel that's pretty
76:09 - good
76:11 - and then i'm gonna make the tab here but
76:14 - uh tap here
76:15 - mode to be bolded
76:19 - and i want it to be
76:21 - again bolded
76:23 - and it's color to be
76:26 - blue
76:28 - and that
76:29 - works pretty good
76:32 - i like what i'm seeing
76:35 - i like what i'm seeing compared to there
76:39 - now what i want to do is i'm going to
76:42 - design the login screen and we are
76:44 - missing the status bar
76:46 - for these two screens so it doesn't
76:48 - matter but later on the status bar will
76:50 - kick in
76:52 - and let's go and design the login screen
76:56 - so what i'm going to do is i am going to
76:58 - basically drag a copy of the sign up
77:01 - screen and i'm going to rename it as
77:04 - login screen copy
77:07 - and
77:08 - the first i'm going to look at the
77:10 - differences the first difference is the
77:12 - welcome back message which is makes
77:14 - sense and then you can see the
77:17 - alignments here of what is the same but
77:20 - how where the text began is the same so
77:23 - what we will do is
77:25 - to keep the same alignment i'm going to
77:28 - just remove your name field here
77:32 - and then it goes up and i'm going to add
77:34 - the
77:36 - welcome
77:37 - back
77:39 - we probably want it to be uppercase i i
77:42 - like it uppercase more now and i'm just
77:44 - gonna drag this
77:46 - but if i press shift you can also go 10
77:48 - pixel up instead of normal one
77:51 - and i'm gonna check the distance that's
77:53 - 12 perfect
77:55 - and the text also has to change it
77:58 - should be if you don't
78:01 - don't
78:04 - don't
78:06 - already
78:12 - i have an account
78:16 - and that
78:18 - works
78:20 - yeah i'm looking at the login screen now
78:22 - and that looks pretty good
78:26 - i don't think it has any issues
78:29 - i think i can ship this one yeah
78:32 - let's move on to the next screen i think
78:34 - the signup and login process is done
78:37 - and let's move to the next things we
78:40 - have to do and i think we have to do a
78:42 - bit more variance before we can
78:49 - all right so
78:51 - let's think about the discover screen
78:53 - and let's find out what we have to
78:55 - design before
78:57 - we move on to the screen what are the
78:59 - elements we
79:01 - have to add as variants so that we can
79:04 - actually make it easy for ourselves when
79:06 - we go to part two and we will copy and
79:08 - paste
79:10 - so that you know
79:11 - we cut our workload again so
79:14 - the
79:15 - a couple of things that we don't have
79:16 - right now is we do not have this top
79:18 - status bar that i believe is present in
79:21 - every other screen
79:23 - and it looks like it has two modes in
79:26 - the first mode it's in the dark blue
79:28 - color
79:29 - you know of our color palette and the
79:32 - second part when it's behind an image is
79:34 - actually white and then i look further
79:37 - and i realize we have a new input type
79:39 - and i think it's the search bar input
79:43 - and that's a new input type and then we
79:45 - have a new
79:46 - element filter elements here one moment
79:50 - filter elements here and it looks like
79:52 - each filter element has two states
79:54 - one is when they are unpicked and one is
79:57 - when they are picked so in the london
79:59 - case here we have a filter element that
80:01 - is picked and then we have a filter
80:03 - element that is unpicked
80:05 - and then we have some cards and it looks
80:08 - like we have a few different
80:11 - options for them we have cities
80:14 - one moment we have cities we have
80:16 - activities
80:18 - and it looks like each city has a three
80:21 - different image and each active is a
80:23 - three different image so i can see just
80:26 - the cycling right biking biking biking
80:29 - they are just changing its position okay
80:33 - so then let's begin by actually
80:36 - finishing the status bar so i'm gonna
80:39 - create a variant for the status bar
80:40 - first
80:42 - so i am gonna do the same process gonna
80:45 - press f
80:48 - and i'm gonna name this frame
80:51 - status bar
80:54 - and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
80:55 - to pick its color i'm gonna
80:58 - tap i
81:00 - and then i copied the color from the
81:03 - inputs
81:04 - and now what i'm gonna do is i am gonna
81:08 - copy this element and i'm gonna paste it
81:12 - and the reason i copied this element is
81:14 - the designing from myself is
81:16 - i it was an element i actually fetched
81:18 - from an ios kit so usually you have to
81:22 - download the apple's resources to
81:24 - actually get the top status bar their
81:25 - design is very intricate it's much
81:28 - better to fetch them yourself and then
81:30 - change their colors for yourself then it
81:32 - just designed from scratch
81:35 - and i am gonna get this one's color to
81:38 - be
81:39 - blue uh
81:40 - for this one maybe
81:42 - we might need to go for
81:44 - white background
81:46 - and this will be a bit difficult because
81:48 - we have a dark color here
81:50 - and
81:51 - maybe a bit of a lighter color because
81:53 - we will also have a white variation then
81:55 - because the background is white we won't
81:57 - be able to see the white variation
81:59 - so let's pick a background maybe
82:02 - somewhere in the
82:05 - bluish here
82:08 - yeah that might work
82:10 - and
82:11 - so right now i'm gonna detach it
82:15 - it was a component before i'm gonna make
82:17 - it this bar
82:19 - like
82:21 - status bar element i'm gonna make the
82:24 - copy for our sake so i'm gonna now make
82:26 - it a component
82:28 - and uh to do that i am gonna
82:31 - press the shortcut ctrl alt k for
82:33 - windows and then i'm gonna add a variant
82:36 - to it
82:37 - and i know now that we know that the
82:42 - the only difference will be its color so
82:44 - what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna
82:46 - basically say
82:47 - uh the the properties value
82:51 - the property will be color and we will
82:54 - just pick its color so
82:56 - for color this is dark blue
82:59 - and for this one we will pick white
83:03 - and
83:04 - let's just do that let's just make this
83:07 - white
83:08 - and boom
83:09 - and that works pretty good
83:12 - so that's your status bar
83:17 - all right so for the filter element i'm
83:20 - gonna do the same thing i'm gonna create
83:21 - my frame with the shortcut f
83:25 - and let's put my frame here and i'm
83:27 - gonna name this frame
83:29 - filter
83:30 - filters
83:33 - and then what i'm going to do is
83:36 - basically
83:37 - i am going to create a
83:41 - frame
83:43 - let's say
83:44 - maybe 32
83:46 - and i'm gonna basically let it have a
83:49 - stroke
83:51 - and i'm gonna give this a 16 pixels for
83:54 - border radius
83:55 - and i want border radius or i want its
83:58 - border color to be blue
84:02 - and then what i want to do is i want to
84:04 - add a text here for its label
84:07 - and let's say
84:09 - london
84:11 - and i want this to be a basically a
84:14 - regular text
84:15 - so i want this to be regular body
84:18 - so let's go to our regular body and
84:21 - let's make this auto wet
84:24 - and i want also this to be have a auto
84:27 - layout
84:28 - so that things always stay at center so
84:31 - i wanted to have an auto layout
84:34 - and i don't want it to hug its content i
84:36 - want it to be
84:38 - maybe i i do want us to
84:40 - hug its content for the
84:43 - wit for its height i'm okay with fixed
84:47 - center
84:49 - so
84:50 - let's think and i want the color of the
84:53 - text to be also the blue
84:56 - and let's see how it works now
85:00 - yep so when so it can it horizontally
85:02 - moves it horizontally
85:05 - increases its bit dynamically but for
85:07 - the height we have a fixed height
85:10 - so that's the
85:12 - i think that looks pretty good to me
85:16 - i'm gonna just check
85:17 - i think this has to be at the center
85:20 - yeah
85:21 - i think maybe eight pixel
85:25 - 8 pixel
85:27 - and
85:29 - e24
85:32 - yeah i think that looks pretty good i
85:35 - think i like that much much more
85:37 - so
85:38 - now that i actually created a design
85:40 - that i like
85:42 - i want it to actually be a component so
85:44 - i can actually make this
85:46 - element a variant so to give it the
85:49 - superpower of a variant i'm gonna go
85:51 - through the same process of doing the
85:53 - shortcut ctrl alt k to make it a
85:55 - component first
85:57 - and i'm going to rename this filter
86:00 - and then i'm going to add a variant to
86:01 - it
86:02 - and
86:04 - the
86:05 - variant property we are going to use is
86:07 - basically
86:09 - uh
86:10 - picked
86:11 - meaning is the filter element picked or
86:13 - not
86:14 - because that's the only change that's
86:17 - the only attribute that determines the
86:18 - change if the filter element is not
86:21 - picked
86:22 - so this is a no
86:24 - it will look like this if it is picked
86:27 - so we have to swap the fill value so i
86:29 - press shift x
86:30 - and i'm gonna get the blue here and i'm
86:33 - gonna make it white
86:35 - and i think i might also make this bold
86:39 - this time
86:41 - yeah so that looks different and this
86:44 - one has to be
86:45 - yes
86:47 - and yeah that is the filters
86:51 - and now they should also show up so now
86:53 - both of our
86:54 - filters and inputs
86:57 - and status bar show up in the assets
86:59 - which is great for us to actually
87:02 - actually use them on the left side
87:04 - instead of going to their original place
87:07 - now
87:08 - let's move on to
87:11 - let's move on to what else do we need
87:14 - bottom navigation and let's get that
87:16 - going
87:17 - and in this design the button navigation
87:20 - we don't have the other screens for the
87:22 - user profile or settings but in the
87:24 - future if we had wanted to grow the
87:26 - application we will definitely need them
87:29 - and for that reason it's probably a good
87:31 - idea to have a
87:33 - three variants for the bottom navigation
87:35 - to have basically selected different
87:38 - icons
87:43 - all right so let's move on forward with
87:46 - the button navigation and i'm going to
87:48 - create the frame with the f shortcut
87:51 - this should be very familiar together
87:53 - guys now we have done this like 10 times
87:55 - i'm going to name this button
87:57 - navigation
87:59 - and i'm going to take a look at the
88:00 - button navigation
88:02 - and okay so it takes the full
88:05 - width of the screen and i think it's
88:07 - between 48 to 60 pixels
88:10 - and it has three icons inside so what
88:13 - i'm going to do is
88:16 - i'm going to go here and i'm going to
88:17 - press f to create the base
88:20 - and it's going to have 375 pixels for
88:24 - width
88:25 - as that is the vet
88:27 - for the iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna
88:30 - have it a fill color
88:33 - and i'm gonna have it the color blue
88:36 - and
88:37 - now i think it's left top and right top
88:41 - sides have a border radius
88:44 - so i'm gonna definitely do that of maybe
88:46 - 12
88:47 - so i'm gonna do
88:49 - eight
88:51 - oh 12 no 16
88:54 - and here 16 nope that wasn't the right
88:57 - one
88:58 - uh 16
89:00 - no
89:01 - the middle one yes i always forget which
89:03 - one is which
89:04 - maybe not even 16 is enough 32 maybe
89:08 - no i think 16 is the right one eh let's
89:11 - look at back
89:13 - yeah i think 16 is the right one
89:16 - so
89:17 - after this what i'm going to do is and
89:20 - is the 48
89:22 - right
89:25 - i think it's a bit bigger than 48 i know
89:28 - this this button is 48 and i'm gonna
89:30 - catch with my eye
89:33 - now i think it's i think it's
89:35 - between 48 to 60 probably
89:39 - let's say 54.
89:44 - maybe 56
89:46 - that's the 56.
89:48 - when in doubt go multiples of four
89:51 - and i don't remember what i designed it
89:53 - to be but it should be somewhere around
89:54 - 56 54 52 maybe
89:57 - but so then what i'm going to do is i'm
89:59 - going to add the icons and to do that i
90:01 - am going to go to our assets
90:04 - and then what i'm going to do is i am
90:06 - actually going to click on the icon set
90:08 - and i'm going to have the compass
90:12 - and i'm done going to have the user
90:14 - profile
90:16 - and then i'm going to have for the third
90:18 - one settings
90:21 - now
90:22 - now that i actually got the content here
90:26 - there is some stuff to do so
90:30 - what i want to do is basically have the
90:34 - left
90:35 - margin of this bottom navigation and the
90:37 - right margin of the bottom navigation to
90:39 - be
90:40 - 24 pixels my mistake that's just a very
90:44 - large zoom out basically if you guys
90:47 - remember
90:49 - how do we show this so
90:53 - i'll shoot four so if you remember our
90:55 - left and right margins is 24 pixels
90:58 - mostly so let's get this to be here so
91:01 - it should be 24 pixels for the left and
91:04 - right and we can show this by
91:06 - in our buttons here actually that's the
91:08 - wrong margin but left is 24 right is 24
91:12 - and we want to keep that for our bottom
91:13 - navigation as well
91:15 - but we also want these elements between
91:18 - each icon to have equal spacing and to
91:20 - do that we have to actually use auto
91:22 - layout
91:24 - so what i'm going to do
91:26 - is i am going to pick these
91:29 - three icons
91:31 - actually i'm going to pick the frame and
91:33 - i'm going to add an auto layout to it
91:35 - and it's going to basically have the
91:38 - horizontal that is correct if we go
91:39 - vertical it's going to be look like this
91:41 - we want horizontal
91:43 - and we want each content to be centered
91:45 - and then what we want
91:48 - is basically
91:50 - we want this to be
91:54 - maybe
91:56 - we'll just say the left margin to be 24
91:59 - the right margin to be 24
92:01 - and it is 46 pixels right now i think we
92:04 - can increase the this to
92:07 - maybe 16
92:09 - and this to be 16 as well and that's
92:12 - pretty good
92:14 - and
92:15 - maybe 15
92:17 - 14
92:19 - 14 might look better
92:21 - yeah and 14 and then what we can do is
92:25 - now the left and right margin my mistake
92:27 - now the left and right margin is 24
92:29 - pixels and distance is equal that looks
92:32 - pretty good now what we have to do is
92:35 - make this icon compass selected and that
92:39 - would be the white
92:40 - and i don't want the black color for
92:43 - either of these icons so i would
92:45 - actually make them go dark blue
92:48 - and that's our bottom navigation now
92:52 - that's just write
92:55 - bottom nav
92:56 - and actually to create the variations of
92:58 - this we have to make this a component
93:00 - again ctrl alt k
93:02 - and then i'm going to add
93:05 - two variations for this two more so
93:08 - maybe one more here
93:11 - okay and we should ask ourselves again
93:14 - well what will the property be and
93:16 - property will be the chosen icon so i
93:20 - will write chosen
93:24 - so
93:25 - in the first one the chosen is pretty
93:27 - simple it is the discover
93:31 - in the second one chosen will be profile
93:35 - and the third one it will be settings
93:38 - now the reason i don't write chosen
93:40 - screen is prop like
93:42 - it would just be three dots and it may
93:44 - be it's too large of a text for it to
93:47 - show so chosen still makes sense and now
93:50 - i'm going to adjust the second
93:53 - button navigation element because
93:55 - in this one what's chosen is the user
93:58 - profile
94:01 - and in this one it will be the settings
94:03 - so
94:05 - and
94:08 - yeah i think that works i think the only
94:12 - stuff that we have to change is i think
94:14 - each of these are now
94:17 - two pixels and i really don't
94:20 - want our icons to have two pixels so
94:22 - what i'm gonna do is
94:24 - i'm gonna go back
94:27 - to the
94:28 - icon set and i'm gonna make these
94:31 - have
94:33 - one pixel width
94:50 - now that we are done with the bottom
94:53 - navigation
94:54 - we can actually
94:57 - go and move on for the image cards
95:06 - all right so let's move on creating the
95:08 - variants for these
95:11 - small
95:13 - image card so
95:15 - if you look at the discover screen here
95:18 - we have
95:20 - kind of two different
95:22 - types of image cards the first one is
95:25 - basically an image that actually showing
95:28 - you the cities like berlin prague
95:30 - amsterdam and in the other cars you
95:33 - actually see the activities so the
95:35 - discovery part one you are picking the
95:37 - city with the cards and discover part
95:40 - two you are picking the activity you are
95:42 - gonna do in that city so that's already
95:45 - two types of
95:46 - variants we can we pick the variant
95:49 - based on
95:50 - its type of whether it's a city or
95:53 - whether it's an activity
95:56 - and
95:58 - that is the way we are going to do but
96:00 - what is also important is
96:03 - if a variant is a city it looks like it
96:06 - has three different types of cities it
96:09 - can be prague it can be berlin and it
96:11 - can be amsterdam and the image looks
96:13 - different depending on what kind of a
96:15 - city it is
96:17 - the same goes for an activity the
96:19 - activity can be eating the activity can
96:22 - be hiking the activity also can be
96:25 - biking so depending not only the type
96:28 - of the cart which is
96:30 - city or activity we also have specific
96:34 - items that we have to account for what's
96:36 - which city is it which activity is it
96:40 - so
96:40 - that's what we are gonna do
96:43 - so
96:44 - let's begin creating the variation now
96:47 - you must be very familiar with this move
96:49 - i'm gonna press f
96:51 - for a frame shortcut and i'm gonna draw
96:53 - this and i'm gonna say
96:55 - image cards
96:58 - and what i'm going to do now is once i
97:01 - named my frame
97:02 - i'm gonna i'm gonna tap the f keyboard
97:05 - keystroke again
97:07 - to draw my card
97:09 - and i'm gonna give this like 156
97:13 - 108
97:15 - and i'm gonna fill this first with like
97:17 - white background but our white
97:20 - and the background of this whole frame
97:23 - i'm gonna darken it because it's very
97:25 - hard to see
97:27 - right now so i'm gonna
97:29 - press i on windows boom
97:32 - all right so
97:36 - i'm going to add a border radius of 8
97:38 - pixels and let's see if i missed
97:41 - anything
97:42 - i think
97:44 - there is a bit wider i'm just going to
97:46 - get the sizing from here
97:48 - for this element that is 150 608 oh i
97:52 - got it right huh my eye was correct i'm
97:55 - glad
97:56 - okay
97:57 - so then what i'm gonna do is
98:00 - i'm actually gonna
98:02 - put in
98:04 - the
98:05 - i'm gonna go click it on my right click
98:08 - and i'm gonna use the plugin called on
98:10 - splash
98:11 - so
98:13 - if you haven't installed this plugin you
98:14 - can just go to your
98:17 - home screen and then you can go here in
98:20 - your community again or you can also do
98:22 - menu
98:23 - plugins
98:24 - and then you say browse plugins in
98:26 - community and search for unsplash
98:30 - now
98:31 - this is a very useful plugin as it lets
98:33 - you import images without leaving figma
98:36 - it's a very good idea to have it
98:38 - installed because as designers we have
98:40 - to actually use these kinds of images
98:44 - all the time and you really do not wanna
98:46 - leave your work setting because it
98:48 - actually disrupts your workflow
98:51 - so
98:52 - you can click on this
98:54 - i
98:55 - also it's installed already for me
98:58 - so you will install this and then you
99:01 - come back and you press right click to
99:03 - use it plugins you find it and you click
99:06 - on on splash
99:09 - and then what we can do is we can look
99:12 - for city
99:14 - and then you can pick basically whatever
99:17 - you want i think we had berlin
99:19 - [Music]
99:20 - so we can pick berlin here
99:24 - and
99:25 - that looks pretty good
99:28 - what we can also do is we can just zoom
99:30 - out and see what else is there so i am
99:33 - realizing that a card is not just an
99:36 - image but it is also an image with a
99:39 - text on top of it now for us to have
99:42 - that white text i believe we need to add
99:44 - some sort of an overlay to certain
99:46 - images
99:48 - because if the image is too
99:51 - let's say white saturated too light the
99:54 - white font will not be visible
99:56 - so let's see so i'm going to press t
100:00 - for text
100:01 - and i'm going to write berlin
100:04 - and that is a bit difficult to see so
100:07 - what i want is
100:09 - i really want this
100:12 - part of the thing and i want this to be
100:15 - actually so the problem we are having
100:17 - right now is if i add a draw if i
100:19 - because the image is added to the frame
100:22 - if i add an overlay to it will it work
100:26 - actually that looks pretty okay
100:30 - yeah no it does work
100:32 - huh i thought it would also overlay the
100:35 - font but it did not i can still see the
100:37 - font clearly this might be a bug but hey
100:39 - it works
100:40 - so now that it works i am just gonna
100:43 - undo the change and i'm gonna go to
100:45 - where i am i want to be at 12
100:49 - by 12 probably
100:51 - so
100:52 - 12 by 12 that looks pretty good and i
100:55 - want my font to be here
100:59 - uh basically body font but bold
101:02 - that first and i wanted to have auto
101:04 - bits
101:06 - and i want to check my surroundings
101:09 - and
101:10 - again it's the auto aligning for the
101:13 - aligning for vertical space is a bit
101:15 - harder so you can see the font actually
101:18 - has a one pixel on its left so this
101:21 - actually is 13 pixels in total so i'm
101:24 - gonna move 11
101:25 - and i'm going to look down and i'm gonna
101:27 - have to move it up two pixels because it
101:29 - has a four pixels
101:30 - bottom oh my bad sorry
101:34 - yes
101:34 - so this and this is actually the 12
101:37 - pixel look
101:38 - okay now that i actually got my card
101:42 - what i'm going to do is i'm gonna to
101:44 - give it the superpower of variance i
101:47 - have to make the component first i'm
101:49 - going to press my shortcut ctrl alt k to
101:52 - make it a component and i'm going to
101:54 - rename this as
101:57 - image
101:58 - card maybe a large image card
102:02 - image card
102:04 - and i am gonna click on the variance
102:07 - plus button there and boom
102:09 - so ahmet
102:10 - how many variants will we have for this
102:13 - and that is a good question
102:15 - so we already know we will have two
102:17 - different types this is a city or an
102:19 - activity and for each city or an
102:22 - activity we will have three different
102:23 - looks so three plus three is six
102:27 - so that's how much we are gonna have and
102:29 - then i'm also gonna go here
102:33 - and i'm gonna go to this variant
102:36 - i'm gonna remove its image it's overlay
102:41 - and probably it's filled
102:44 - and i am gonna go right click plugins on
102:47 - splash
102:49 - and i'm gonna fetch here prog
102:53 - and if you haven't been to prague you
102:54 - are missing out it's one of my favorite
102:56 - cities
102:57 - i'm just giving it
102:59 - prague is a fantastic city
103:01 - so we have berlin prague what was the
103:04 - third city
103:05 - uh my memory fails me come on
103:08 - come on i'm at the amsterdam okay i've
103:12 - never been to amsterdam i mean i've been
103:13 - to the airport airport is nice i don't
103:15 - know the city
103:16 - but let's go here
103:18 - let's delete this
103:20 - and let's right click plugins unsplash
103:24 - and let's pick amsterdam
103:30 - let's see
103:31 - probably this one
103:34 - i think it's that one
103:37 - i might be wrong but
103:39 - yeah it's that one
103:41 - okay our images look intact that's good
103:44 - so the city picks are done now
103:47 - i am now going to add the
103:50 - activities and i'm gonna add
103:53 - till six here
103:57 - oops my bad
104:00 - all right so i have now my six cards now
104:03 - here okay
104:04 - so the fourth one will be the first
104:06 - activity and let's
104:08 - delete the image delete the overlay and
104:11 - let's make this
104:14 - basically the activity of eating
104:17 - because that's my favorite thing to do
104:21 - i mean
104:22 - what are what else are you gonna do you
104:24 - are gonna walk the city and you are
104:25 - gonna probably eat but there are some
104:27 - people among us who probably like hiking
104:29 - as well
104:31 - well to each to its own so i'm gonna
104:34 - just
104:37 - remove the white as well i'm gonna do
104:39 - plugins and we are gonna pick
104:42 - where is the unsplash here i'm gonna
104:45 - pick
104:46 - hiking all right
104:51 - and that's pretty good
104:53 - and for the last one
104:56 - we are gonna pick biking but to do that
104:59 - we have to remove the image
105:02 - and right click
105:04 - this is getting pretty repetitive right
105:06 - now
105:07 - and i am going to ride biking
105:11 - and i am looking for this dude right
105:13 - here yes
105:15 - all right so
105:19 - let's
105:20 - fix with our fonts first so this is
105:22 - berlin this is prague
105:27 - and this is amsterdam
105:32 - and
105:33 - so if you notice now
105:35 - while we can read berlin pretty easily
105:38 - it's very hard to read prague
105:40 - and
105:41 - one thing we really want to do is we
105:44 - want all of these images to have the
105:46 - same overlay because
105:48 - if this design actually went to
105:50 - production if a front-end developer were
105:52 - to take this
105:54 - project
105:55 - they would probably tell you yeah i will
105:57 - not go through each image and put
106:00 - a different kind of an overlay this has
106:02 - to be
106:03 - general and so you don't want to give
106:06 - them too much work
106:08 - so what you want to do is you want to
106:10 - find your worst case scenario meaning
106:12 - the image that is lightest i believe for
106:14 - cities is amsterdam
106:16 - and for the active it's the berlin one
106:19 - sorry it's the fourth activity it's the
106:21 - biking one
106:23 - and we are gonna
106:25 - try to give these guys to overlay first
106:28 - so that's what i'm gonna do 20
106:31 - maybe
106:32 - 25
106:34 - i think 25 will work
106:38 - i think 25
106:40 - will do the job
106:42 - let's look at amsterdam our second worst
106:44 - case scenario
106:46 - all right yeah 25 works
106:49 - so that's what i'm gonna do
106:52 - five pixel 25
106:55 - 25 overlay
106:59 - for eating as well
107:02 - 25
107:04 - and that is pretty good
107:07 - so now i'm gonna
107:09 - actually rename these
107:11 - berlin prague amsterdam this is
107:14 - eating
107:18 - this is hiking
107:22 - and this is biking
107:24 - all right so now that we are actually
107:26 - done with the content of the variant
107:29 - what we want to do is
107:31 - we actually want to specify our
107:33 - properties now our properties were
107:36 - two-fold meaning the type
107:38 - of the card is a city card or an
107:40 - activity card and the second is its name
107:44 - is it berlin prague amsterdam these are
107:46 - all the names so what i'm gonna do is
107:48 - i'm going to make my property the first
107:51 - property to be type
107:53 - and i'm going to go to the more option
107:55 - here add a new property and i'm going to
107:57 - specify this as name
107:59 - and i'm going to go to my first one
108:02 - and i'm going to specify type to be city
108:05 - because it's a city and the city's name
108:07 - is berlin
108:09 - i'm going to go the second one
108:11 - city
108:13 - name
108:14 - prague
108:15 - and figma will give you sometimes errors
108:17 - if you ever make a mistake
108:19 - so it's now saying it doesn't have it
108:21 - has an invalid name which is what we
108:23 - want to avoid so we gotta give it
108:25 - amsterdam
108:29 - and you wanna now i'm on to the
108:31 - activities so this one won't be city but
108:34 - an activity
108:35 - and it will be the activity of eating
108:38 - oh i'm getting hungry
108:41 - but
108:42 - let's plug along this is hiking
108:46 - and this one is going to be
108:49 - activity
108:52 - biking and i'm going to do a quick
108:54 - overview activity hiking that's correct
108:57 - always double check your work
108:59 - city amsterdam city prague see the world
109:03 - that actually looks pretty good and
109:05 - though that is your
109:08 - variance and just for the final check
109:10 - you can go to your assets and now you
109:12 - can actually see
109:14 - let's open this a bit you can see the
109:16 - image cards right here as an asset
109:19 - that's fantastic
109:20 - all right guys
109:22 - so this part of the tutorial is done
109:29 - oh now we are going to update our input
109:32 - fields to add the search field as well
109:35 - and let's begin by analyzing how it
109:37 - looks like on the discover screen so
109:39 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
109:40 - click my screen i'm going to press shift
109:42 - 0 to zoom 100 percent
109:45 - and off the bat what i'm realizing is
109:47 - this if i'm comparing this with the
109:49 - login
109:50 - input field such as the email and
109:52 - password
109:53 - i realize that the height of the element
109:56 - and the width of the total element is
109:58 - the same as 48 pixels 48 pixels 327 327
110:03 - pixels
110:04 - now
110:06 - search field also has a placeholder just
110:08 - like the email and the name fields here
110:13 - and the difference it has is it has a
110:15 - button that is right aligned inside at
110:18 - the search button and that's the one
110:20 - difference that it has
110:21 - and it also can have the actual value in
110:24 - our design such as when a user actually
110:27 - does an input or picks a filter element
110:30 - the placeholder is replaced by the
110:32 - actual text
110:34 - label
110:36 - what does this mean so right now in our
110:38 - input variants we only have the
110:41 - placeholder version for the my bad sorry
110:44 - guys
110:45 - we only have the placeholder version
110:47 - right for the name or the email we do
110:50 - not have an actual value version where
110:52 - how the user would see this input field
110:55 - if they had already put in a value so
110:57 - that's also something we are going to
110:59 - add and we are going to add this to
111:02 - almost every element except password
111:04 - because in terms of user experience
111:07 - standpoint it is not a good idea to add
111:10 - a placeholder to the past password field
111:13 - because it is not that recognizable you
111:16 - probably want to put it just
111:19 - a line to your label
111:21 - like probably around
111:24 - around here if we were to put it to say
111:27 - 6 or 12 characters like give some
111:29 - constraints on how the password should
111:31 - actually
111:32 - contain but it's not a good idea for
111:35 - consistency to just do a bad user
111:38 - experience so we are not going to have
111:40 - the password field have a placeholder
111:43 - but let's begin by adding our
111:46 - search field and i am going to
111:50 - make this basically
111:53 - search
111:55 - city or activity
111:59 - and what i'm going to
112:01 - then do is i'm going to press r for
112:04 - shortcut i'm going to do this drag it
112:06 - it's 40 pixels height probably and 64
112:10 - pixels
112:11 - width and i'm going to give it the
112:12 - standard 8 pixel border radius that we
112:15 - have and i'm gonna change its color to
112:17 - our blue
112:19 - and that already looks good i'm gonna
112:22 - make it go align for shift
112:24 - and maybe not that much but i'm gonna
112:26 - zoom in
112:28 - to see how am i doing four four
112:32 - maybe
112:33 - four four four
112:35 - that looks pretty good
112:37 - and then i'm gonna click on this element
112:41 - and what i'm going to do is i'm gonna
112:44 - right click go to plugins because i want
112:47 - to add my search wait why am i doing
112:50 - that i already have in my assets field
112:53 - my icon set so i can just drop this bad
112:56 - boy in
112:57 - i can bring the search here
113:00 - boom and that looks pretty good
113:03 - i'm gonna give it the color of white
113:07 - and i'm gonna
113:09 - center these two okay that's pretty good
113:14 - and i might even group these things
113:17 - and i don't need them to be framed
113:20 - like search button
113:24 - and that's pretty good
113:27 - and then i'm going to look
113:30 - and
113:31 - zoom out a bit that looks pretty good
113:34 - so
113:35 - what's this going to be is this is going
113:38 - to be
113:39 - search
113:40 - but now as we said before only type
113:43 - property will not be enough because we
113:45 - also want to differentiate if an input
113:47 - has a placeholder or an actual text so
113:51 - i'm going to have to add another
113:52 - property so i'm going to my variants and
113:55 - i'm going to go to the more options and
113:58 - i'm going to click i'm going to click on
114:01 - the add new property
114:03 - and i'm going to say
114:06 - placeholder
114:09 - and if it's a yes
114:14 - and for this one it will also be a yes
114:18 - and
114:20 - let's actually show some versions of how
114:22 - these things would look like so i'm
114:24 - going to have
114:25 - new
114:27 - one for the text
114:30 - and
114:32 - one more for the email
114:34 - so
114:35 - and i'm gonna move this
114:38 - up
114:39 - and this is the hassle with the
114:42 - variants i wish they had a drag drag and
114:45 - drop right it would just resize
114:48 - re-center itself vertically but it
114:50 - doesn't
114:51 - so i'm gonna drop these
114:54 - yep and this one will be the
114:58 - no
114:59 - placeholder and this time it is actually
115:01 - going to be
115:02 - like jason mamoa
115:05 - and it is actually going to have dark
115:09 - yes
115:10 - that's how it's going to look like this
115:12 - is where a user has actually put in
115:14 - their name
115:15 - and right now we have the email and i'm
115:18 - going to move this as well this is going
115:20 - to be the email
115:22 - input field with an actual value not a
115:24 - placeholder
115:26 - and aligning these things is a bit
115:28 - difficult but we will do a polish soon
115:32 - so
115:33 - this is no
115:36 - and
115:37 - email yes place i don't know
115:40 - and what we want here is this is email
115:44 - and what we want this to be also is
115:48 - basically
115:51 - jason
115:53 - hot mail.com
115:56 - and i want this to be
115:58 - dark blue
116:01 - boom and that looks pretty good
116:04 - then
116:05 - what i want to do is i will not give the
116:08 - second type for password in an actual
116:10 - production we would actually have
116:12 - password show and not show but in this
116:15 - application we are not using that
116:16 - variant so i'm not gonna add it
116:18 - no need to go over perfectionistic here
116:22 - but i'm gonna add the second version of
116:24 - the search so in this search we have a
116:26 - search and the placeholder is yes
116:29 - and in the second one
116:31 - which i'm gonna delete
116:33 - because i'm gonna pick this and if i
116:35 - press but like plus it will duplicate it
116:39 - which is pretty good for figma
116:41 - and it will be
116:43 - london
116:46 - and that will be dark blue
116:48 - and that looks pretty good i kind of
116:51 - like it
116:52 - and that's now
116:54 - basically align these things basically
116:58 - space them
116:59 - pretty good maybe distribute them
117:03 - vertical spacing yep
117:05 - and get them left aligned that looks
117:07 - better
117:08 - okay
117:09 - so we are done with the adding the
117:12 - search input field and we added the
117:13 - other options for our
117:15 - name and email field such as
117:18 - adding the option type a placeholder or
117:20 - not now i think we are ready
117:23 - to actually design the discover screen
117:26 - and
117:27 - let's do that in the next video guys
117:34 - oh now the long waited moment of
117:36 - actually designing the new screen
117:39 - and let's zoom in let's do shift
117:43 - 2 to zoom in and this is our screen
117:46 - and we have a status bar which we
117:48 - already created the variants for we have
117:50 - a
117:51 - text big title text asking where does
117:54 - the user want to go and then we have a
117:56 - search field we have the filters and
117:57 - then we have the favorite cities as the
118:00 - city is the first thing a user will pick
118:02 - before an activity
118:04 - oops my bad and so let's do that so what
118:08 - i'm going to do is i'm going to press on
118:11 - f and i'm going to pick iphone mini
118:13 - and i'm going to drag the one that is
118:15 - created to here
118:17 - i know our design actually document is
118:20 - getting crowded we have to actually
118:22 - move things around a bit but i just want
118:24 - to do this screen first before we do
118:26 - that maybe finish the discovery part too
118:28 - as well
118:29 - so
118:30 - now what we will do is basically we will
118:32 - go to our assets and because we already
118:34 - did the heavy lifting i'm just gonna
118:35 - pick stuff i'm gonna go to my
118:40 - i'm gonna
118:41 - click on the status bar i'm gonna drag
118:43 - one here
118:45 - and i'm gonna
118:46 - basically zero
118:47 - for x 0 for y
118:50 - and that looks actually pretty good then
118:52 - what i want to do is i want to press t
118:55 - for creating a text field shortcut and i
118:58 - want to write jason
119:00 - where do you want to go
119:04 - and i know already that
119:06 - the type for this will be bold header
119:10 - so that looks pretty good and i do not
119:13 - want this to be out of it because it
119:15 - would what could happen is it would
119:17 - actually
119:18 - go over the
119:19 - whole screen because it's too wide so
119:22 - what i can do is i can give this
119:24 - an auto height
119:26 - and i want this to be left aligned
119:28 - obviously and
119:30 - let's zoom in here a bit and i want this
119:33 - to have the color of dark blue
119:37 - and that looks pretty good and around
119:39 - here is pretty good
119:42 - and where do you want to go
119:47 - and that looks pretty good so far so
119:50 - then what i want to do is i want to add
119:52 - the search field so for that i wanna
119:56 - okay so for this
119:58 - and again the
120:01 - what's happening is
120:04 - all right the it's the media recording
120:06 - software i'm using is bugging the figma
120:09 - because it's basically overlaying it in
120:11 - front of it and that is pissing me
120:13 - off but hey we did it so
120:16 - this one will actually be a
120:18 - search
120:20 - and look at that look and then we will
120:22 - have
120:23 - our filters and i am going insane with
120:26 - my recording tools
120:28 - guys
120:29 - i never thought this would be a problem
120:31 - but hey
120:32 - if you are using a recording to irish
120:34 - there was an option to pull it to the
120:36 - maybe top side that would be fantastic
120:38 - but
120:39 - it's it happens it's not that perfect
120:41 - for only so
120:43 - i have my filter element now and what
120:45 - i'm looking at this design screen is
120:48 - we basically have a horizontal
120:51 - scrolling view option means basically
120:54 - the user understands they can actually
120:56 - tap with their thumb and move to swipe
121:00 - to right or left to move left or right
121:02 - and that is only shown as a signal when
121:06 - the
121:07 - some half part of this filter
121:10 - element is actually
121:12 - hidden
121:13 - so the user understands visually okay
121:15 - for me to see the remaining part i need
121:16 - to swipe
121:18 - so that part is very important so what
121:20 - i'm gonna do is i'm gonna have four
121:23 - i'm gonna double duplicate this
121:26 - two three
121:28 - and maybe four times but first let's
121:31 - make this
121:32 - istanbul
121:35 - so istanbul
121:37 - and what other cities do we have we have
121:39 - vienna and new york
121:42 - okay so let's make this vienna
121:46 - and
121:50 - let's
121:51 - make the last one new york
121:56 - and that one can be new york here
122:00 - i'm double okay fingma is bugging a bit
122:02 - new york
122:04 - and that's good and then what i'm going
122:06 - to do is i'm going to select all of
122:08 - these
122:09 - and i'm going to
122:10 - frame them and then i'm going to
122:13 - maybe make 24 pixel and i'm going to
122:16 - move the x here
122:18 - okay that's too much maybe 12
122:21 - i think 12 is the right
122:24 - i think 12 looks pretty good there
122:27 - maybe
122:28 - yeah 12 looks pretty good i'm gonna
122:31 - check the distance between the top
122:32 - elements
122:34 - and
122:35 - i want the search field to be at the 24
122:37 - pixel
122:38 - i want the text to be at the 24 pixel
122:42 - and maybe
122:44 - around here and that's pretty good
122:48 - and then what i want to do is
122:50 - i want to actually group
122:54 - all these guys into a frame
122:58 - and that is with ctrl alt g
123:01 - and i will rename this as filters
123:05 - and that's pretty good so now i'm gonna
123:07 - go maybe one pixel up because it's 24
123:10 - pixel it's consistency with the left and
123:12 - right margin that is pretty neat
123:15 - so i'm gonna go what else am i missing
123:18 - i think we are missing the
123:23 - i think the half of the screen is done
123:27 - we might have some spacing issues we
123:28 - might polish later on but let's just add
123:31 - the new text now so i'm going to press t
123:35 - for the text shortcut and i'm going to
123:37 - write favorite cities
123:41 - and what i'm going to do is i am going
123:43 - to pick for this color dark blue and for
123:46 - the text size i think i'm going to go
123:48 - with the sub header bold
123:50 - and i can make this out of it because
123:52 - it's not that big enough to actually
123:55 - go overflow of the screen
123:57 - and
123:58 - once we have our sydney text i can now
124:01 - add the cards which we already created
124:04 - the variants of so that's handy
124:07 - so i'm gonna put myself here
124:11 - for you guys to see and
124:13 - oh
124:15 - i'm gonna pick this one here
124:18 - all right so we put our cards here and
124:22 - now just like the filter element our
124:24 - cards are also horizontally scrollable
124:26 - and we do the same basically signaling
124:29 - saying because half of the card is
124:31 - actually
124:32 - not seen on the screen the user
124:34 - understands i have to swipe
124:37 - and that's exactly what we are gonna do
124:39 - as well
124:40 - so
124:41 - this is gonna be here
124:43 - and i'm gonna do this
124:46 - and i'm gonna do this
124:49 - and
124:50 - now
124:51 - what we want to do is we want to grab
124:52 - these three and make them a frame
124:55 - so we can actually add some auto layout
124:58 - so i'm gonna go layers
125:00 - and i'm gonna name this as
125:03 - favorite
125:04 - cities i think
125:08 - i think thing might put it outside of
125:09 - our iphone frame i'm going to put it in
125:12 - i think that bug
125:13 - kinda tried to ping my sometimes bugs a
125:16 - bit so what we want to do now is we want
125:20 - to add an auto layout here
125:22 - of maybe 24 pixels
125:25 - that's that's too much maybe 16
125:29 - maybe 12.
125:31 - i think 12 does the job and we want to
125:33 - center these
125:35 - and we probably want them to be
125:38 - centered here
125:41 - and
125:42 - now
125:44 - what i want to check for is our
125:46 - alignment for the
125:48 - text so i'm gonna press shift r
125:52 - and i'm gonna get it here
125:55 - and we are almost there but i think
125:59 - i think for the text we are good
126:02 - i think for the
126:05 - text inside the status bar we can do a
126:08 - bit more left but it doesn't matter too
126:10 - much because it's something outside of
126:12 - our control we don't design these these
126:14 - are given by the apple so i i don't have
126:17 - a problem with that part
126:19 - okay so now our alignment looks pretty
126:22 - okay for the
126:23 - vertical
126:25 - now then what we can do is we can
126:27 - actually
126:28 - pick the cities so the first is
126:30 - amsterdam berlin and prague
126:33 - so this one is
126:36 - amsterdam
126:40 - berlin
126:42 - and proc
126:45 - and that's pretty good
126:47 - so i'm gonna check its distance to the
126:49 - top that should probably be closer than
126:52 - 24 pixels
126:54 - maybe
126:55 - 16
126:57 - would work pretty good here
126:59 - and i'm gonna get even closer maybe
127:03 - so what i'm trying to see is what's the
127:05 - bottom
127:06 - spacing here
127:08 - it's i think four pixels
127:11 - so if i get it to 12 it will actually be
127:14 - 16 pixel difference
127:17 - so
127:18 - that looks pretty good i'm gonna click
127:20 - on it i zoomed out too much shift two
127:23 - okay
127:24 - so this looks pretty good i'm gonna add
127:27 - the favorites to these text
127:30 - and so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna so
127:34 - cities this is favorite cities
127:37 - cards
127:38 - so if i were to put this text here
127:42 - you wouldn't see the text because it
127:44 - would actually try to auto layout the
127:46 - text as well so that's not what you want
127:48 - to do what you want to do
127:52 - is actually we have to go back what you
127:55 - want to do is you want to close this
127:57 - cities frame and you want to frame these
128:00 - two as well
128:03 - and that will be favorite cities
128:08 - that's pretty good so now we can
128:10 - actually duplicate it by pressing alt
128:12 - and drag
128:15 - and we are gonna do that with shift so
128:17 - it doesn't change
128:18 - and that looks pretty good
128:21 - so let's see
128:24 - so one thing i want to make sure we have
128:26 - is our bottom navigation
128:29 - as well
128:31 - and you can you see how easy it is to
128:34 - add these things once you have created
128:36 - the variants already
128:40 - and oh i think our bottom navigation
128:43 - width is wrong so
128:45 - it might be a good idea to go back and
128:47 - check it so it should be the whole
128:49 - screen so that should be 375 pixels
128:53 - so i'm gonna look at here
128:55 - and i'm like okay
128:57 - so mod would be 126.
129:02 - okay that's too much
129:03 - so for
129:05 - here
129:06 - what we want to do is
129:08 - i think for the vet we want it to be
129:11 - fixed
129:12 - and that should be 375 pixel
129:16 - and for each of these also the bits
129:18 - should be fixed it should be 375 pixels
129:23 - so let's do that
129:25 - and these mistakes happens guys design
129:27 - is an ongoing process nobody does it
129:30 - perfectly one thing i learned from my
129:34 - once i turned this into a full-time
129:36 - career and i'm a full-time aux designer
129:39 - we always make mistakes and you making a
129:42 - mistake is actually your opportunity to
129:44 - learn something and develop so do not
129:47 - judge yourself as harshly when you make
129:49 - mistakes we all do it's not an if but
129:52 - when and
129:54 - your reaction to your mistakes will
129:56 - actually determine your outcome you can
129:59 - choose to learn from them so i now
130:01 - learned how to that i should double
130:04 - check my bit when it's for variants
130:06 - so i'm going to go back to the
130:09 - to my nav
130:11 - screen i'm going to rename it to be
130:12 - discovery discover part one
130:16 - and
130:17 - for the
130:18 - second part we have top picks for cities
130:23 - so this should be top picks
130:26 - and the third one should be
130:30 - let's see under eyes
130:33 - okay
130:36 - so then
130:39 - what we can do is
130:41 - so i'm gonna check the distance between
130:43 - these two that should be 24 pixels maybe
130:47 - well it's also related so maybe 16
130:50 - [Music]
130:51 - as well
130:53 - so then this one is also 16
130:58 - and that looks okay maybe we can go so
131:02 - in here i did 24 okay i understand
131:05 - because they are each separate so maybe
131:08 - 10 so what i'm doing is if i press shift
131:11 - it just does double so it just actually
131:14 - does 10x so it moves 10 pixels down or
131:17 - up
131:17 - so i'm trying to get to 24.
131:23 - so my math is failing me
131:26 - and so in this one
131:29 - the
131:29 - in the second one the images
131:32 - so
131:32 - while we are using the same
131:34 - cities we are changing their uh location
131:38 - so this one will be berlin
131:40 - this case and in this one this will be
131:43 - berlin
131:45 - and then what is the middle
131:48 - so amsterdam is the middle
131:53 - so amsterdam here is the middle part
131:58 - and
132:01 - this one will be prague
132:06 - yeah
132:07 - and that looks pretty good to me i'm
132:10 - gonna do shift
132:12 - i'm gonna just move
132:14 - zoom out a bit
132:16 - and that looks pretty good i'm gonna
132:19 - check my spacing
132:21 - so all of these can go one pixel up for
132:24 - 24 pixel
132:28 - yep that's pretty good
132:31 - that is pretty good and
132:34 - yeah all these can go one pixel up
132:37 - because it's a 25 pixel there
132:40 - and
132:44 - yeah maybe
132:46 - maybe one more
132:50 - so maybe everything in here
132:53 - can go one more pixel up
132:57 - and that looks
132:59 - pretty good i'm just gonna check the
133:03 - high so 68 therefore y
133:06 - 68 here yeah that is perfect so that is
133:09 - our discovery part 1 screen
133:12 - and
133:13 - we can also do the second part very
133:15 - easily what we will do is we will
133:17 - duplicate this
133:20 - screen
133:23 - and we will rename this discover
133:27 - part 2
133:28 - and what we can do is we can actually
133:30 - pick a city here and the top i picked
133:33 - london but i want to pick istanbul my
133:35 - hometown
133:36 - so i am gonna actually go here i will
133:39 - swa i will toggle it one thing figma
133:42 - does very well on variances if you
133:44 - actually created the variant property
133:47 - and gave it the value yes or no it
133:50 - actually understands that it shows it as
133:52 - a toggle
133:53 - so
133:54 - yes no it's istanbul
133:57 - and then what i want to do here is we
134:00 - have a placeholder now
134:02 - and
134:03 - this should be not text but search
134:07 - and
134:08 - so one thing it doesn't have oh
134:13 - so i think we made a mistake here i
134:16 - think we
134:18 - didn't create the search field
134:22 - well so let me see here so what is this
134:25 - field search yes
134:28 - okay so in some part here
134:30 - we actually made the type search and
134:32 - placeholder yes have two different
134:35 - uh
134:36 - mappings meaning there's some another
134:38 - element that also has the same values
134:40 - here
134:42 - so let's quickly search
134:46 - search yes okay so this is
134:49 - okay this is yes search this is search
134:52 - placeholder now okay so now the mistake
134:55 - should be resolved actually so if we go
134:58 - here we say search
135:00 - placeholder now
135:01 - and we can type this to be
135:06 - istanbul that is pretty good
135:09 - and that is our second pick guys
135:12 - it is our second discover screen that
135:14 - looks pretty good to me
135:16 - and yes i will see on the next video
135:23 - so let's move on to the actual detail
135:26 - screen i'm going to zoom into it by
135:30 - pressing shift 2
135:32 - and this is after we picked a city and
135:35 - we picked activity this is the screen we
135:38 - see and i'm looking at the screen and we
135:40 - already have the status bar we already
135:43 - have the icon for this we have the
135:45 - background image which where we know we
135:48 - can use unsplash to actually get it and
135:50 - we have the text here but one thing we
135:53 - do not have is we do not have these
135:57 - avatars and this is meaning these
136:00 - profile pictures with the labels below
136:03 - them that tells the
136:05 - user who who are attending and what are
136:07 - their names who will you meet
136:10 - and we also don't have the
136:12 - the small link here so
136:15 - if you look at this link like this
136:17 - c-more and c-all is a bit different
136:20 - c-more is basic it's going to extend but
136:22 - sealed is probably going to create a
136:24 - pop-up co is almost like a button here
136:27 - and it's something we call a tetriary
136:29 - button where it's not even a secondary
136:32 - button with the
136:33 - stroke around and with the background
136:36 - like in our
136:37 - large button
136:39 - let me show you so it's not even this
136:43 - but it's almost like it doesn't have a
136:45 - background it's just a text with the
136:46 - underline on it but it still functions
136:48 - as a button then we have these cards
136:52 - which we don't have so it looks like we
136:54 - have three four things here we need to
136:56 - do the avatars variants so that we can
137:00 - actually have multiple versions of this
137:02 - you probably need a small button
137:05 - variations right now we only have large
137:07 - button variations but we know in the
137:10 - next screens especially here we will
137:12 - need smaller versions of those buttons
137:15 - and that's an entirely new category
137:17 - itself so they will have to be a new
137:19 - variant group and then we will need
137:21 - these cards these
137:24 - benefit cards i believe like this
137:26 - activity is cost friendly or this
137:28 - activity can make you friends or
137:30 - something else
137:31 - so let's begin with
137:34 - the
137:34 - avatar
137:36 - variation so what i'm going to do is i
137:39 - am going to zoom out a bit and i'm gonna
137:41 - play press f for short key
137:45 - for frame and i am going to title this
137:48 - frame as
137:51 - avatar
137:53 - images
137:54 - and then i'm going to do shift 2 to zoom
137:57 - in and i'm going to press all for a
137:59 - shortcut for a circle shape
138:02 - and i'm going to make this basically 48
138:05 - by 48
138:08 - and i just want to check if it is 48
138:11 - let me check it looks like 60.
138:15 - is it 60 i want to see
138:19 - it is 60. okay
138:21 - not wrong because 48 look just a bit
138:23 - small to my eyes so let's do 60.
138:30 - and one thing i want to do is i want
138:33 - this
138:34 - circle to first
138:36 - not actually have a fill
138:38 - and i want to right click and use my
138:40 - plugin
138:42 - user profile which will actually give us
138:44 - random profiles
138:47 - now
138:48 - ah to actually install the user profile
138:50 - plugin i want you to click on top menu
138:53 - go to plugins we did this before now
138:55 - actually installing a plugin and
138:58 - and then what you can write here is
139:02 - user profile
139:05 - and once you're done i want you to
139:07 - filter by plugin not files
139:09 - and then i want you to install the first
139:11 - one here
139:12 - and then come back
139:14 - so once you install you can actually use
139:16 - the plugin now so right click go to
139:18 - plugins and go to your user profile and
139:23 - you have a few options now i want male
139:25 - female i don't care
139:27 - and i want to insert a random photo
139:29 - and then what i want is i want to press
139:33 - and i want to write here what does this
139:36 - guy look like he looks like an anton
139:39 - i do not know why but he does
139:42 - so i'm gonna make this a
139:43 - [Music]
139:45 - body regular
139:47 - and then i'm going to center these guys
139:49 - and i'm going to press both of them
139:52 - and i am actually going to
139:55 - frame these two together so i can create
139:57 - them a component and then make them a
139:59 - variant
140:00 - so this is my frame of
140:04 - uh maybe large avatar
140:08 - because i know in the later screens we
140:10 - will have a small avatar so large avatar
140:12 - and then now the next thing i want to do
140:14 - is i want to actually make this a
140:16 - component so i'm going to press
140:18 - ctrl alt k
140:20 - for shortcut and now it's a component
140:23 - and i'm going to add
140:25 - a new variant what is the attribute we
140:28 - are doing basically depending on the
140:31 - name of the person their looks is going
140:33 - to change now of course two people can
140:36 - have the same name and their face will
140:39 - not be the same but not for our avatars
140:41 - if the name is different they are
140:43 - probably going to have a different image
140:44 - okay
140:45 - so
140:46 - real life exceptions don't count so i'm
140:49 - going to right click by selecting the
140:51 - circle i'm going to go to user profile
140:54 - and i'm going to insert another random
140:56 - photo awesome and that looks like to me
141:00 - mary
141:01 - i'm literally judging stock photos here
141:04 - but that happens that's life
141:06 - so i'm gonna click right i'm gonna go
141:09 - plugins again
141:10 - user profile
141:12 - the same
141:17 - okay
141:20 - george
141:22 - and
141:24 - one thing you can do here is
141:26 - actually is you can do an auto layout
141:30 - for vertical
141:31 - and then you can center and this is a
141:34 - very good idea for each of them because
141:36 - like we see here if the name gets too
141:38 - long we stopped being centered and you
141:40 - have to then spend time centering things
141:43 - and that is not an ideal use of our time
141:46 - so i'm gonna do auto layout
141:48 - and i'm gonna center each of these
141:51 - maybe two pixels
141:55 - yeah 2 pixels might do the trick
141:58 - actually
142:00 - and add the auto layout
142:03 - center
142:04 - and 2 pixels
142:06 - there we go okay so george is good
142:10 - let's add a new one and i'm just gonna
142:13 - add a new one so five is good enough
142:15 - so let me replace these as well
142:23 - okay
142:31 - all right
142:33 - i'm gonna name this guy
142:35 - luke
142:37 - and i'm gonna
142:39 - name him matthew
142:42 - alright
142:44 - so this looks pretty good
142:47 - so we have the avatars now and now one
142:50 - thing we don't have is well we have the
142:52 - content we haven't specified the
142:54 - property or the values so right now if
142:56 - we were to actually
142:59 - create
143:01 - like fetch an instance here
143:03 - we would not we would just have variant
143:05 - two variant three those are not name
143:08 - those are not
143:09 - values that we could actually
143:11 - remember six months later when we are
143:13 - going to use this
143:15 - variant and say what is variant for
143:18 - but the name is much more memorable so
143:21 - that's what we are gonna do
143:23 - now the property is going to be name
143:26 - obviously
143:29 - so
143:30 - name and then i'm gonna go through each
143:34 - and i'm gonna give them the name anton
143:39 - mary
143:43 - and this process might actually be
143:45 - boring but it really pays off guys
143:48 - because
143:49 - this is the only repetition we will do
143:52 - anything else we will do is when we are
143:54 - going to use this on design is just drag
143:56 - and drop
143:58 - all right i think i'm pretty good with
144:00 - my avatar images
144:01 - and i think they look pretty good
144:08 - all right so let's move on to create the
144:11 - next
144:12 - set of variance and i want to do the
144:16 - small button versions basically i want
144:19 - this this is our one of the tertiary
144:22 - version of our button
144:24 - and on here we have the secondary and
144:26 - the primary
144:28 - so i'm going to zoom out here
144:32 - and i believe we do not have for the
144:35 - small buttons a disabled version
144:39 - i think we might actually add it
144:42 - a disabled version might actually work
144:44 - well
144:46 - so
144:47 - what i'm going to do i'm going to
144:48 - actually buttons here
144:51 - and
144:52 - i am going to add this variant to the
144:54 - buttons but what i'm going to do is i am
144:57 - actually going to
144:59 - inside here i'm going to
145:01 - click on the frame and i'm going to
145:03 - press f
145:04 - to create
145:05 - create the surrounding box
145:08 - for my small button
145:10 - and this is probably gonna be
145:12 - 32 pixels
145:14 - maybe 96 starting i mean it will have a
145:18 - auto layout but let's say 32 pixels
145:21 - and 8 pixels border radius
145:26 - okay so
145:28 - what we will now do is we can fill it
145:30 - with let's say white but
145:33 - probably blue
145:34 - all right so let's get this and let's
145:36 - put the text on it
145:39 - let's say done
145:42 - oops sorry guys my typing skills are not
145:45 - that good today
145:47 - and done and
145:49 - bodybuild that is pretty good i want
145:52 - this to be out of it
145:54 - and i'm gonna have it here and i'm gonna
145:56 - click on my
145:59 - frame here and i'm gonna rename it as
146:02 - i'm gonna rename it as small button
146:07 - perfect and then i'm going to add an
146:10 - auto layout on it
146:13 - and i probably
146:15 - want to make its vet
146:18 - for now fixed
146:21 - and centered
146:25 - like
146:26 - maybe it can grow
146:28 - but i just want this to be like
146:32 - yeah that looks pretty good to me
146:35 - actually
146:36 - it's in version that looks pretty good i
146:39 - just want to make sure i want to double
146:41 - check if i got the height right
146:43 - and it looks like i did get the height
146:45 - right maybe
146:46 - it can be a bit wider
146:49 - right this is a bit wider
146:51 - so
146:53 - maybe we can do that
146:55 - make this a bit wider and the other
146:58 - label we can use cancel that is actually
147:00 - a bit longer so what we can do here is
147:03 - we can center it
147:05 - and maybe do 32
147:09 - 32
147:12 - and
147:14 - maybe not make it fixed
147:17 - and that might be pretty working and
147:20 - let's see if we add text it will
147:22 - actually dynamically resize it well
147:25 - so that's good because we want the
147:27 - cancel to actually have the same padding
147:29 - as well but let's make the
147:31 - height of it fixed
147:35 - and let's make that center
147:38 - okay because i will make this a compound
147:40 - by pressing ctrl alt
147:43 - k
147:45 - and now it's a component i can make this
147:47 - a variant
147:49 - boom so this is our primary button and
147:53 - how we are going to do this is basically
147:56 - we are going to have just like our large
147:59 - button we are going to have an active
148:01 - state or a priority state
148:04 - and
148:05 - because in the future if we don't know
148:07 - if our small buttons can also be
148:08 - disabled so for now we can just add them
148:12 - and in the future they might actually
148:13 - come useful so let's add the property
148:17 - active
148:20 - and then i'm going to click on this more
148:22 - options button to add a new property and
148:24 - the second
148:26 - property will be priority
148:30 - all right
148:32 - so
148:33 - okay so i'm going to go to the first one
148:36 - now and this is active
148:39 - that is
148:41 - yes
148:42 - and priority
148:44 - primary
148:46 - and i want this to be our
148:48 - secondary button so
148:50 - i'm gonna click on the button and i'm
148:52 - gonna press shift x to actually switch
148:55 - the
148:56 - fill value with the stroke value and i'm
148:59 - gonna click on that
149:01 - label and i'm gonna pick
149:04 - blue
149:05 - and i think we have to make this our
149:07 - white here
149:09 - yes
149:10 - so this works pretty good
149:12 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
149:14 - going to press
149:15 - to create another variant but before
149:17 - that i am going to say
149:19 - yes for active
149:21 - but priority is secondary
149:25 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
149:26 - going to create third theory and for
149:28 - that what i will do is i will actually
149:33 - i will get
149:35 - probably i might get rid of the
149:37 - surrounding uh
149:40 - i might get rid of the surrounding
149:42 - button here
149:43 - so what i will do is i'm just gonna come
149:46 - here i don't want a stroke value there
149:49 - and i want to resize it to the i want to
149:51 - resize the surrounding frame to the
149:53 - width and height of the text so i'm
149:56 - gonna hold alt
149:59 - and i'm just gonna
150:01 - yep
150:02 - maybe a bit larger
150:06 - so just a bit larger so that
150:09 - it doesn't cut off the labels
150:11 - and that is our third here button
150:14 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna click
150:16 - here
150:18 - and okay
150:20 - and let's go up here and say active
150:23 - yes
150:25 - and priority
150:26 - tertiary
150:28 - which is a very hard word
150:30 - and let's check if this one also goes
150:32 - out of bounds okay so one problem we
150:35 - have here is this
150:38 - if we actually increase the
150:41 - width of the element
150:43 - it doesn't increase with the element
150:45 - itself meaning the auto layout doesn't
150:47 - resize so let's check
150:49 - if we have the auto layout
150:54 - so
150:55 - let's look at here
150:58 - yep probably want to hug its content
151:03 - it's just maybe we can reduce the
151:06 - padding it has
151:10 - yeah so this might work better actually
151:13 - yes this works better
151:16 - so how about we do it this way and one
151:18 - thing we want to do one more thing is we
151:20 - want to underline this
151:22 - so i'm going to
151:24 - go to its label
151:26 - and i'm gonna
151:27 - go where is it
151:30 - so that is correct where do we underline
151:34 - this
151:36 - i am searching on figma
151:39 - all right this style alignment now
151:43 - maybe control you
151:46 - now
151:47 - okay so let's go
151:50 - here
151:51 - text
151:53 - underline
151:56 - hmm
151:58 - i think for some reason this did not
152:00 - work
152:02 - why would that be
152:06 - okay
152:07 - for some reason the underline doesn't
152:09 - work i do not know why it doesn't work
152:12 - so far
152:13 - but we can figure this out later i will
152:15 - figure this out on my own this is the
152:18 - this is the small buttons we have so i'm
152:20 - going to rename these as small button
152:22 - that's correct and this one is large
152:25 - button and we should be able to see it
152:27 - in the assets
152:29 - and
152:30 - let's close the editor images button
152:32 - navigations
152:34 - and if we scroll down and move
152:37 - on the bottoms we have now the large
152:39 - button and the small button and that's
152:41 - perfect
152:42 - i will see you in the next video
152:48 - all right so we are going to design the
152:51 - benefits cards in the details screen but
152:54 - i want to tell you that i found a
152:56 - problem with underline here so
152:59 - if i'm clicking the text and i look at
153:01 - the more options i can see that it is
153:03 - actually selected as underlined so the
153:06 - problem is we do not have enough margins
153:08 - at the bottom to show the underline
153:11 - and to actually do that we have to go
153:13 - back to the
153:14 - frame of the label
153:16 - and
153:17 - if you look at here our vertical spacing
153:21 - is fixed so first we have to actually
153:23 - make it a hug content and the moment we
153:26 - did
153:27 - our
153:28 - height stretched a bit to the
153:30 - surrounding
153:31 - margins that we had specified
153:33 - and now what we can do is we can reduce
153:36 - these to the minimum amount that will
153:38 - still be enough to show
153:40 - the
153:42 - what would you say to show the
153:47 - elements underline an element itself and
153:49 - that looks pretty good and then what we
153:52 - can do is
153:54 - we can actually make the
153:57 - now we can actually make the height
154:00 - fixed
154:02 - and that is yep that works
154:06 - that works that's the one
154:08 - so we have our underline there now so we
154:12 - can move on so now i will move to the
154:14 - details screen here and our so
154:18 - our secondary button our small button is
154:21 - done as a variant our avatar is done now
154:25 - if you
154:26 - can see here these are our cards our
154:28 - button overflows them actually because
154:31 - our booking now button actually has a
154:33 - primary importance
154:35 - but
154:36 - actually in the background you can see
154:38 - these cards listen like what is special
154:40 - what is the benefit of this
154:43 - let's say activity
154:45 - why are all these people going and
154:48 - so for that what we have visually is a
154:50 - basically a
154:52 - white rectangle white background we have
154:54 - a text at the center of it that is
154:56 - vertical and then we have a icon on the
155:00 - right side in a circle
155:02 - that is enclosed with a circle so that
155:05 - is what we are going to design
155:07 - so i'm going to go
155:09 - and press f
155:11 - we are going to make this a
155:13 - variant as well
155:15 - as you know because we might have
155:16 - different variations and i'm going to
155:18 - name this
155:19 - benefit
155:21 - card
155:23 - and i actually am also going to
155:26 - get its color to be with eye to this one
155:30 - because it has it is going to be a white
155:32 - rectangle it's hard to see on a white
155:34 - background as well
155:35 - so i'm gonna press f
155:38 - and i know the vitalfit with the circle
155:41 - is 327. so if you pay attention here
155:47 - you zoom out a bit
155:49 - let me go back
155:50 - so you can see that the button which is
155:54 - a 327 pixel width has the same width as
155:58 - the
155:59 - card but for the card you have the
156:02 - rectangle and the circle at the right
156:04 - top side so it is the
156:07 - rectangle
156:08 - plus the circle size that ends up having
156:11 - the
156:12 - same bit as the large button we have so
156:15 - we gotta calculate the size of the
156:17 - circle as well it's probably 24 pixels
156:20 - but it's at the middle part so the
156:22 - calculation is a bit tricky
156:24 - so
156:25 - that's why what i'm gonna do is i'm
156:26 - gonna fill it with white immediately
156:31 - and i'm gonna give it a stroke here the
156:33 - same stroke we use 4 to 16
156:37 - 10 pixels
156:39 - and i'm gonna make this also have eight
156:43 - whoa
156:44 - all right and we probably want this to
156:46 - be
156:47 - like 48 as well
156:49 - that is too much
156:51 - what's happening so maybe 256.
156:56 - yeah that kind of looks okay but
157:00 - maybe
157:01 - we can get this to be a bit longer and
157:05 - i am literally just exploring sizes here
157:09 - maybe this can be 32
157:11 - 32
157:13 - and i know its color is actually the
157:16 - blue that we use
157:18 - so if i were to add this here
157:22 - if i were to look at both of these
157:24 - frames
157:25 - okay how do they look like right now so
157:28 - this is going to be
157:30 - the card
157:34 - background
157:37 - and this one will have a text inside of
157:40 - it
157:41 - that will say
157:43 - let's just copy and paste the text there
157:46 - so let's just ctrl c
157:51 - come back here
157:55 - yep
157:58 - okay
158:00 - wait where is that circle okay that
158:02 - circle is there i think the text
158:04 - disappeared i'm gonna recreate it and
158:06 - i'm gonna paste this okay
158:08 - then i can actually make this out of it
158:10 - that's good and i'm gonna make
158:13 - this text to actually have the style of
158:15 - a normal body it is regular
158:18 - perfect
158:19 - and
158:21 - let's look at it so it's 15 15 i want it
158:24 - to be 12 and centered
158:26 - and
158:27 - again centering is usually difficult
158:29 - with vertically as we talked about
158:31 - let's look at the spacing here
158:34 - three and a half four in the bottom so
158:36 - we are much more biased uh for the
158:39 - bottom
158:39 - so we want a bit more on the top
158:44 - so
158:45 - that looks pretty okay yes
158:48 - so that looks a bit more centered and
158:50 - now what i want is i want this button to
158:54 - actually have an icon as well so i'm
158:56 - going to go here
158:58 - nope i already have my icons in the
159:00 - assets panel
159:01 - and i am going to pick the money
159:06 - and
159:07 - that
159:08 - kind of looks a bit too big what i will
159:11 - do now is i will actually head over to
159:14 - our
159:15 - icon set and i'm going to resize some of
159:17 - the icons because as we talked about so
159:20 - here where we made the icons components
159:24 - so as we talked about while the
159:26 - surrounding box of the icons are the
159:28 - same the sizing can actually change and
159:31 - we might want to have different sizes so
159:33 - this one is actually like
159:37 - let's see so let's see the inside
159:40 - elements for the
159:41 - dollar sign
159:43 - i'm gonna go layers
159:45 - and that's 12 14 that's 22. so i want
159:48 - this actually to be resized and i wanted
159:52 - to have
159:53 - i want to use my icon resizer frame
159:57 - how you can install this you can go to
159:58 - plugins and then you go again browse
160:01 - plugins in the community
160:03 - and then you can type here icon resizer
160:06 - and then you will go on plugins filter
160:09 - and then you can install it
160:11 - and once you install it come back to
160:13 - here
160:14 - click on plugins and go to icon resizer
160:17 - and this lets you specify an icon box
160:20 - site which is 24 pixels which we want
160:23 - and maybe the maximum height to be 16
160:27 - and that's pretty good and i'm going to
160:29 - do that for most of my icons here
160:32 - so i'm going to do icon resizer
160:35 - probably 16
160:36 - [Music]
160:38 - and i'm gonna probably do it for this
160:40 - one as well
160:42 - plugins icon resizer 16
160:47 - okay
160:49 - and that looks pretty okay so far
160:53 - i won't do it for my bottom navigation
160:56 - or these
160:59 - i think those two or three will be
161:01 - enough
161:03 - yeah i think those two or three is
161:04 - enough so let's go back
161:07 - and actually add our
161:09 - actually delete
161:12 - actually now that you can see it
161:14 - actually shrunk a bit which is good we
161:16 - are going to pick its color right
161:18 - and that
161:20 - kind of works
161:22 - so
161:23 - now i am going to actually group the
161:26 - ellipse with the dollar sign
161:31 - okay so what i'm going to do is i'm
161:33 - going to rename this as the
161:36 - benefit icon
161:39 - and now what i'm going to do is
161:42 - i am going to frame i'm gonna
161:45 - get the card background frame and the
161:47 - group and i'm gonna
161:49 - frame these as well so i'm gonna press
161:51 - ctrl alt g for frame
161:54 - and this is gonna be my benefit
161:56 - card and then i'm actually going to make
161:59 - this
162:01 - a component
162:02 - and i'm going to add a variant
162:05 - perfect and my second variant is going
162:08 - to be
162:10 - let's look
162:13 - and before adding the second variant i
162:16 - think we forgot to check the size okay
162:18 - so our size is still pretty small
162:22 - so what we can do is so i know this
162:26 - circle
162:27 - actually will be half the
162:29 - it's
162:31 - with inclusion it to add its width we
162:34 - are only adding the half of its bit to
162:36 - the total because it is at the inside of
162:39 - the card a bit
162:41 - and that is like 16 pixels
162:43 - 327 pixels is the total width v1 so this
162:47 - should actually become 311.
162:52 - so
162:53 - and then this circle should move
162:58 - so let's make this move 10 pixels
163:03 - okay
163:04 - and let's
163:07 - let's also increase this
163:12 - sure
163:13 - okay so
163:15 - this is getting a bit buggy
163:17 - okay
163:18 - so
163:19 - right now it's not centered yet
163:22 - correctly
163:24 - i
163:25 - think okay so this is 32
163:29 - i think that is pretty correct so far
163:35 - okay so let me see the total with here
163:41 - 326. so maybe we are missing in
163:45 - okay
163:46 - i think this can be now correct
163:50 - okay 327 64 pixels i think that is right
163:56 - i want to see if the height of this
163:58 - element was 48 pixels it might be
164:01 - 32 in the actual design
164:03 - let's see let's go back and let's zoom
164:06 - in
164:07 - and let's see
164:09 - inside that was 50 actually okay so
164:12 - that's actually pretty long element i
164:14 - will keep it at 50 i will keep it at
164:16 - 48. and that is our element so now we
164:21 - can just add the second
164:24 - variant
164:27 - and i'm gonna get it to be a bit closer
164:29 - and this one is actually going to have
164:32 - an attribute of
164:35 - benefit
164:39 - and this one is
164:41 - going to be
164:44 - budget
164:46 - friendly
164:48 - and this one is basically going to be
164:51 - maybe exercise
164:56 - and i'm going to get the text for the
164:59 - second one as well
165:01 - from our screens
165:04 - so
165:08 - yep so i'm gonna just
165:10 - ah just
165:16 - yes
165:20 - okay let's say this active helps you
165:22 - burn calories figma is breaking out a
165:24 - bit
165:25 - so i'm just gonna say this activity
165:27 - helps you burn calories
165:30 - 30
165:32 - and that is a very weird saying activity
165:37 - helps you burn calories
165:40 - and that looks pretty good i'm gonna
165:42 - replace this icon inside as well
165:47 - so i'm gonna
165:48 - add
165:50 - the
165:51 - icon of the exercise here
165:55 - and i'm gonna
165:56 - change its color to white
166:00 - and that is
166:02 - perfect
166:04 - so
166:05 - that is
166:07 - pretty good
166:10 - i think that does look pretty good
166:13 - but
166:14 - let's see i don't think that's putting
166:16 - the same
166:17 - so i'm going to just get this to be here
166:21 - and yeah that is our benefit cards guys
166:26 - let's see if we forgot anything
166:30 - i don't think we have that looks pretty
166:32 - good
166:33 - only thing we have to do is make this
166:35 - exercise that's good
166:37 - i think we can now
166:39 - actually begin
166:41 - designing
166:43 - the detail screen
166:44 - [Music]
166:49 - all right now that we have actually
166:50 - designed the variants we need for the
166:53 - details screen we can actually begin and
166:56 - design the details copy screen so what
166:59 - i'm going to do is i'm going to press f
167:01 - for shortcut
167:03 - frame and i'm going to
167:05 - click on iphone 13 mini
167:07 - and i'm gonna rename this as details
167:11 - copy
167:12 - and what i'm gonna do is so basically
167:15 - first i need
167:18 - a status bar so i'm going to my assets
167:21 - and i'm going to close my icon set
167:24 - inputs
167:26 - and just going to grab a status bar here
167:31 - and i'm going to put it to zero
167:34 - 0
167:35 - and so one of the things i'm realizing
167:37 - is we need a
167:40 - basically a rectangle element for the
167:42 - background image so i'm going to make
167:44 - this 375 pixels
167:46 - maybe it's like 192.
167:50 - might be a bit bigger than that one but
167:52 - i'm gonna make this go zero zero
167:56 - and i will go to layers and i'm gonna
167:58 - rename this background
168:00 - and then what i'm going to do is i am
168:02 - actually going to go plugins
168:05 - and i'm going to add an
168:07 - image here from the unsplash
168:10 - and it is the same image we had for
168:12 - biking
168:15 - and yeah so that's the image i'm going
168:18 - to add and maybe
168:19 - 256 instead of yes
168:22 - that looks better and
168:24 - i know that this needs an overlay so i'm
168:26 - going to add an overlay
168:29 - percent actually looks good maybe 25
168:33 - and that looks bigger and now i'm gonna
168:36 - zoom in with shift two
168:38 - and i'm gonna compare here so what i
168:40 - need right now is
168:43 - so i'm going to move the status element
168:45 - above the image so it will actually show
168:47 - and i want the status bar to be
168:49 - basically white
168:51 - and that looks pretty good
168:53 - and then what i need is the back chevron
168:57 - icon
168:58 - so that the user can actually go back so
169:00 - i'm gonna go to my assets
169:03 - to my icon set and i'm gonna get the
169:06 - chevron left icon here
169:08 - i'm gonna put it around there and i'm
169:10 - gonna basically select its color to be
169:14 - white
169:16 - and that's pretty good so far then i
169:18 - will add my text for biking
169:26 - and then i will add my load um some text
169:29 - so i'm gonna copy this
169:33 - and i'm gonna t and i'm gonna just copy
169:37 - and
169:38 - paste here and this is probably gonna be
169:42 - just a
169:43 - regular
169:45 - and then what i'm going to do is i need
169:48 - for the location my location icon
169:51 - and for the pricing i need my dollars
169:53 - icon so
169:55 - for that i am gonna
169:57 - bring my dollars icon here
170:00 - and for the location i'm gonna pick my
170:03 - map icon
170:04 - and that looks pretty good
170:08 - so i'm gonna look up
170:10 - and i'm literally just adding the stuff
170:11 - we need like the bottom navigation
170:15 - so i will just move my profile here
170:19 - so i'm like bottom navigation
170:22 - and you can go in any order you want for
170:24 - these i just know let's see if this is
170:27 - complete bottom
170:31 - yes i think this is
170:34 - it
170:35 - for it yep i think that is vertically
170:38 - and horizontally centered let's just
170:39 - zoom in a bit
170:41 - to see if we are
170:43 - actually centered at well
170:45 - maybe we went overboard a
170:48 - yes that is the
170:50 - correct coordinates
170:53 - and then
170:55 - we have a
170:56 - basically
170:59 - a long paragraph with
171:00 - about but let's finish the basic card
171:04 - design with the activity background
171:06 - there
171:07 - so i'm gonna get another t for
171:11 - london
171:12 - ontario location
171:15 - and i'm gonna make this
171:16 - autobit and i'm gonna make sure this is
171:21 - regular and then i'm gonna make sure it
171:23 - is actually
171:25 - white here
171:27 - and i'm gonna make sure that the
171:29 - location icon is also white
171:33 - perfect
171:35 - and then i am gonna make sure biking is
171:38 - actually a regular header 34 bold
171:42 - and i'm gonna make it out of it as well
171:46 - and we are getting there i believe we
171:49 - are getting there pretty good now in the
171:51 - original design there are some mistakes
171:53 - that i'm not repeating here like
171:55 - this sharing icon to match the other
171:57 - icons actually should be
171:59 - is 2 pixel but in the new design we
172:01 - decided that we want each stroke to be
172:04 - one pixel so that's okay
172:07 - and i'm looking i think i'm also missing
172:09 - this
172:12 - 38 dollar person
172:16 - yes
172:17 - and so
172:18 - let's begin arranging some stuff
172:22 - and i'm gonna
172:24 - basically put this at 24 and what i want
172:29 - to do is
172:31 - i actually want to see the layout so i'm
172:35 - going to do
172:36 - alt shift 4
172:38 - oh that didn't happen so
172:40 - ctrl shift 4
172:42 - sorry yes ctrl shift 4 to see the
172:46 - layout columns we have and
172:49 - in this one so what i want is i want a
172:52 - layout grid
172:55 - i want to do columns
172:58 - 5 margin
172:59 - 24
173:01 - that's also 24 maybe 16.
173:05 - yeah
173:06 - that works so based on this i now know
173:10 - how to actually align my items
173:12 - and so it should be around here
173:16 - and this one because
173:18 - like we said a horizontal alignment is
173:21 - also sometimes difficult because
173:23 - you see the
173:24 - fonts which is starting from here the
173:26 - actual font is for the biking b starts
173:29 - here so there's like three pixels
173:31 - of empty space
173:33 - and when you are aligning things those
173:35 - three pixels matter so that is how the
173:38 - proper alignment would work
173:40 - and
173:41 - this is around there so what i'm going
173:43 - to do now is i'm going to get
173:45 - london ontario and
173:47 - location icon
173:50 - and basically move all of them
173:53 - just a bit yes so that mattress
173:56 - maybe get the london ontario a bit
173:58 - closer and i'm gonna make these centered
174:02 - that's pretty good
174:04 - and now what i'm looking for is what's
174:06 - the distance i think it should be around
174:08 - 12 to 16 pixels there so i'm gonna group
174:10 - these
174:13 - i'm gonna actually frame these so this
174:15 - is the location
174:19 - location info
174:22 - and
174:24 - this one
174:28 - so for this one
174:30 - where did our
174:33 - i think we had a dollar icon but it
174:35 - disappeared oh it's there
174:37 - i just didn't change its color so let's
174:39 - get it to white
174:41 - and let's
174:43 - frame this with ctrl g
174:46 - and
174:48 - let's just go to layers and let's say
174:51 - price info
174:53 - for them i'm like okay
174:56 - and let's move this
174:58 - here
174:59 - and let's
175:00 - make our stream smaller
175:04 - and what i want to do is i actually want
175:06 - to do an auto layout to our frames
175:09 - and this i'm going to center them
175:12 - and that's pretty good and i'm going to
175:14 - basically
175:17 - press
175:18 - ctrl
175:19 - or
175:21 - i think
175:22 - no i think it looks pretty good right
175:25 - yeah i think what's the distance between
175:28 - these two that's one pixel
175:31 - i think it can be
175:33 - so if you zoom in the surrounding so the
175:36 - icon inside the locations is like four
175:39 - five six pixels away so maybe two pixels
175:42 - would make it eight so i'm gonna make
175:44 - this
175:45 - two
175:46 - and i'm gonna add an auto layout here
175:49 - too
175:50 - i'm gonna center it and i'm gonna make
175:52 - this two as well
175:54 - and then i'm going to get these to be
175:56 - aligned
175:59 - and i'm gonna zoom in again
176:01 - and these have to be moving to left a
176:03 - bit
176:04 - so that we have a left alignment with
176:06 - the biking
176:07 - this one needs to be moving here yes
176:12 - and then
176:14 - i am gonna get this a bit closer
176:17 - not that close
176:19 - but somewhere around
176:21 - here
176:24 - yeah somewhere around here would work
176:26 - what's the distance here
176:28 - so that's eight pixels
176:30 - ten
176:32 - and i wanna look at here two four six
176:34 - seven that's 18 pixels so maybe
176:38 - one two back and that should be around
176:40 - 16 and that looks pretty good
176:43 - so
176:45 - now what i'm going to check is the
176:46 - distance between here
176:49 - that is
176:50 - let me zoom out a bit
176:52 - that is
176:53 - four pixels eight pixels plus 11 here
176:58 - and that's 1922 23 that is too far away
177:02 - so
177:03 - what i'm gonna do now is that
177:07 - i am actually gonna go up and compare
177:09 - and contrast
177:11 - so you can see how our bottom here is 24
177:15 - left is 25 that's something we want to
177:17 - do as well
177:18 - so i'm gonna
177:20 - decrease
177:22 - the height here a bit and i'm going to
177:23 - check its contrast that's too much so
177:26 - this should actually be
177:28 - from 24 in the left to 24 at the bottom
177:31 - so
177:32 - and now that we align the height of it
177:35 - to the actually baseline in the second
177:37 - line
177:38 - this is actually pretty accurate 28
177:41 - pixels is a pretty accurate tire so i'm
177:43 - gonna
177:45 - maybe
177:46 - 24 perfect
177:49 - and i'm gonna get both of these to be
177:51 - down as well
177:54 - maybe here
177:57 - 15
178:00 - and 19
178:02 - so maybe one two three
178:05 - that's pretty good and i'm gonna get
178:07 - this down as well
178:11 - and that is
178:13 - three
178:16 - eight and
178:19 - up three eight two that's fifteen to
178:21 - sixteen
178:23 - maybe one more up and at sixteen and
178:26 - that's pretty good
178:29 - so what i will do now is i'm gonna
178:32 - actually
178:33 - look out and decide if the position
178:37 - if the positioning of the arrow icon is
178:39 - pretty good and
178:41 - i think it is
178:44 - like we can always get this time to the
178:46 - left like we have it above here but that
178:49 - is actually in the production not in our
178:51 - control
178:52 - like these are things that you get
178:54 - custom
178:55 - from the apple ios kit
178:57 - so you actually don't have much control
178:59 - there all right so onward to the second
179:02 - part i'm gonna press shift two to zoom
179:04 - in
179:05 - and what i'm gonna do is i am gonna
179:07 - press t
179:08 - for text shortcuts and i'm gonna write
179:10 - about
179:12 - and i'm gonna
179:13 - actually go and copy all this paragraph
179:16 - till here
179:19 - actually all of them actually yes
179:21 - here
179:22 - copy all of them and i'm going to
179:24 - basically press t again
179:27 - draw one and then paste all that text
179:30 - all that websome text and i'm gonna make
179:33 - this
179:34 - basically go
179:36 - regular 15
179:38 - left aligned
179:41 - it
179:42 - and
179:45 - now one thing that actually we might
179:48 - need to do here is
179:51 - we might need the
179:53 - 15 pixels here it's
179:56 - let's just finish the let's do the
179:58 - header first because i think our spacing
180:00 - is a bit different so you can see here
180:02 - we are a bit spacious and we are at 17
180:04 - pixels so maybe not the
180:06 - body regular but maybe regular here
180:10 - that looks a bit better yeah
180:13 - so i think this height is a bit better
180:16 - and what i'm going to do is i am going
180:18 - to pick this as bold sub header
180:20 - and i'm going to make this go out of it
180:24 - and i'm gonna
180:25 - make sure that our color here is dark
180:28 - blue
180:30 - and then i'm gonna go up
180:32 - and i'm gonna do the attendees as well
180:34 - so i'm gonna drag this
180:36 - header with the alt press and i'm gonna
180:39 - basically write here a 10
180:42 - these 34.
180:45 - i'm going to make a left
180:47 - line here
180:49 - and i'm gonna also make this go out of
180:51 - it
180:53 - and maybe
180:54 - here
180:56 - it's a pretty good idea then what i'm
180:58 - gonna do is i'm gonna add our avatars
181:01 - you didn't think we would use them did
181:03 - you so i'm gonna go here move my
181:07 - profile and i'm gonna go avatar and i'm
181:10 - gonna add them here
181:11 - so this is anton and let's see how many
181:14 - we have there we are roughly five four
181:16 - six and because we can see a beginning
181:19 - of my next hours are just at the edge of
181:21 - the screen so that signals to the user
181:23 - that you can actually swipe that's
181:25 - exactly what we are gonna do we are
181:26 - gonna then have six avatars
181:29 - so let's do two three
181:32 - four five six
181:35 - and let's
181:36 - select all of them and make them a frame
181:39 - ctrl alt g
181:42 - and then we will write this as avatar
181:44 - frame
181:46 - and we want the auto layout so we can
181:48 - add spacing around tanks maybe 16 pixels
181:52 - and we definitely want to center things
181:55 - and we yes we definitely want to center
181:57 - things and now we we probably want them
182:00 - to be around
182:02 - here
182:03 - something let's actually
182:07 - how do we center this thing so let's
182:11 - let's see i think this is the center
182:14 - for us that's not quite right so let's
182:16 - think this through
182:18 - maybe 12 pixels
182:21 - because i remember how it looked and
182:25 - okay so
182:28 - is it true that we got six of them yes
182:31 - so maybe 24
182:33 - okay so our spacing is too small so
182:36 - maybe 24.
182:39 - let's see
182:40 - so
182:42 - yeah i think 24 is the spacing we used
182:46 - 24 is a bit too much and it's
182:48 - you know i'm not respecting the
182:50 - horizontal distance here so because in
182:52 - here it was 12 i think 12 will work
182:55 - better so i would much rather ask to
182:57 - have 12
182:59 - around here
183:02 - so i'm just gonna
183:04 - do okay so that's 25 to 20. so maybe
183:08 - let's check now that's true okay i went
183:10 - the wrong way to three
183:12 - that's 21
183:15 - 2
183:16 - okay so let's see maybe
183:18 - minus 22.5
183:21 - and that's perfect and now let's pick
183:24 - everything to be different so let's pick
183:26 - this to be mary
183:29 - let's pick this to be george
183:31 - let's pick this to be look or matthew
183:35 - and lo
183:36 - no let's
183:38 - pick that matthew and let's anton again
183:41 - and that's fine
183:42 - so and the distance between the avatar
183:45 - and the attendees should be roughly 24
183:48 - pixels
183:49 - but we will get there
183:51 - so
183:52 - next i think what we need before we
183:55 - space things up is actually get
183:57 - everything we need so we need a
183:59 - small
184:00 - territory button here so i'm gonna
184:03 - select the details go to assets again
184:06 - and we will go to buttons now and we
184:08 - will get a small button
184:10 - and we will make sure that it is active
184:13 - but
184:13 - territory
184:15 - and that will be like see all
184:20 - all and
184:24 - let's see
184:25 - okay so here's a mistake so
184:29 - so we
184:30 - needed to be hugging its contents but
184:33 - then why is it not hugging the content
184:35 - of c all
184:38 - so what did we do here
184:40 - maybe we gave it a second okay it's
184:42 - because we made it not have auto of it
184:45 - but no it should have auto of it so okay
184:47 - so that looks pretty good see all here
184:51 - is that right
184:53 - okay so maybe
184:55 - like the initial s is capitalized
184:59 - which is fine
185:01 - all right and maybe this one's too okay
185:05 - so that's a bit better
185:06 - let's enter this
185:10 - a bit
185:11 - up
185:12 - all right
185:14 - and let's
185:16 - check it here we need the cards for the
185:18 - benefits
185:20 - and so i'm gonna open here
185:24 - and i'm gonna definitely get my benefit
185:26 - card
185:27 - right here
185:29 - all right so my benefit card is there
185:32 - and i'm gonna get rid of the
185:34 - the
185:35 - columns there ctrl shift four okay that
185:39 - looks a bit better
185:41 - and
185:42 - so one thing that
185:44 - i want to check is what is the
185:48 - color of this
185:49 - details copy and it should match our
185:52 - white here
185:53 - that's good
185:55 - okay
185:56 - so this should be 24.
185:59 - yep
186:01 - and
186:02 - so i'm gonna get this up as well
186:05 - i'm gonna check so this should so there
186:07 - is a bottom margin here of four pixels
186:09 - so this should be like
186:11 - twenty
186:13 - one two three four
186:16 - okay that looks pretty good
186:19 - and
186:21 - then what i'm going to do is i am
186:23 - actually gonna get this
186:26 - up as well so i'm gonna check 24 and
186:29 - it's
186:30 - this for this paragraph i don't need to
186:32 - go and check because it's line height
186:34 - matches where the frame
186:35 - where its
186:37 - actual height is so 24 pixels per tag 24
186:40 - pixel there is actually 24 pixels so
186:43 - then what i'm going to do is
186:46 - i am gonna
186:47 - press ctrl shift 4 just to see where i
186:50 - should have ended here and i'm going to
186:52 - zoom in a bit
186:54 - so this should be a bit to the right
186:57 - yes
186:59 - i think that is correct
187:02 - and maybe down
187:06 - yes
187:07 - that works
187:08 - i'm to move my profile here
187:11 - and then i'm going to check the distance
187:13 - between there
187:15 - that is also 4 pixels so that should be
187:17 - also 20
187:19 - because 4 plus 20 equals 24
187:23 - which is the distance we are looking for
187:25 - that's good
187:26 - and then
187:28 - i'm gonna
187:30 - make this to be 24
187:33 - but i'm gonna get this height to be
187:37 - nope my bad
187:39 - set
187:40 - i'm gonna check
187:43 - maybe
187:44 - 24 here
187:46 - and then i'm gonna
187:49 - copy and paste it here
187:52 - like that so it's like so i can drag it
187:55 - here
187:56 - and i'm gonna go layers the problem
187:58 - right now we have is that
188:00 - the benefit card is above the bottom
188:02 - navigation which is not what we want so
188:04 - i'm gonna pick the bottom nav here
188:09 - oh my bad guys i'm gonna pick the bottom
188:11 - nav here and actually move it up so it
188:13 - is actually above the benefit cards
188:16 - it's around here
188:19 - and i want this to be exercise
188:22 - and i want the distance between these
188:24 - two
188:27 - [Music]
188:29 - yep
188:30 - i want the distance between these two to
188:33 - be
188:34 - i think
188:35 - i think around here let me just move
188:37 - things here
188:40 - yeah
188:41 - so i think we can give it this height i
188:43 - think we need a bit more height here so
188:44 - i'm gonna make things smaller
188:46 - so now i can actually move these two up
188:51 - and i'm gonna check
188:55 - that's 24
188:57 - i think for this we need 20
189:01 - that's 20
189:02 - and for these we will get them up two
189:06 - that's
189:08 - 24
189:10 - and for this i want 16
189:13 - as they are the same elements and that's
189:16 - pretty good
189:18 - then what i can do is i am gonna get my
189:22 - so i'm gonna check
189:24 - how far away am i and i think i'm
189:26 - missing a bit so okay so with avatar in
189:28 - the previous app i actually had just 16
189:31 - pixels
189:33 - and with this i just had
189:35 - okay so i just had 16 pixels there so
189:38 - maybe because attendees is related to
189:41 - the avatar that makes sense
189:44 - to maybe move them up a bit so one two
189:47 - three four five six seven eight
189:50 - and that should give me 16 pixels there
189:53 - and but these for these i am gonna move
189:56 - up
190:00 - yep and
190:02 - that is pretty good
190:05 - okay so now i'm gonna add my main button
190:09 - logan i'm gonna add here
190:12 - and this should be 24 pixel to the
190:16 - navigation so it should be one two three
190:19 - four five six
190:22 - and that should be
190:23 - the
190:24 - book now
190:30 - okay that's good and again the main
190:33 - difference we are having here is i'm
190:35 - going to press shift 2
190:37 - and press shift 2
190:39 - so i am looking here and i'm gonna
190:42 - change its color to be
190:46 - one moment i made a mistake i'm gonna
190:47 - change the text color to be here
190:50 - dark
190:51 - blue that is fine it is blue that is
190:55 - blue
190:56 - and yeah i think those are pretty good
190:59 - i think i'm gonna get rid of the columns
191:02 - now
191:03 - and let me check
191:05 - that looks pretty good
191:08 - compared to our original sample
191:12 - i think our coloring still hasn't
191:14 - updated
191:16 - but
191:18 - let's do maybe
191:21 - white 100 yeah that looks pretty good
191:26 - yeah
191:28 - i think for some reason we are not
191:30 - getting this color
191:33 - i don't know why
191:36 - like this is the white color isn't
191:38 - updating well i will figure that out
191:40 - later
191:41 - but for now this works i like it i think
191:45 - it's a bit more spacious
191:47 - than what we have here but i still like
191:49 - it
191:50 - and one thing that it has here is this
191:55 - yeah overall it looks pretty good
191:57 - i would say so i think it all looks
191:59 - pretty good
192:02 - yeah
192:03 - i'm proud that looks pretty good
192:06 - all right so that is the details copy
192:09 - guys
192:11 - i'm gonna check here
192:13 - that looks pretty good
192:15 - i think these two need to be
192:18 - centered yep that looks better
192:21 - i think that's the only part
192:23 - but yeah i think this looks pretty good
192:26 - i'm very proud
192:27 - and in the next one we will go on to the
192:29 - variant so we can actually begin the
192:32 - scheduling screens and i will see on the
192:35 - next video guys
192:40 - right so the first variant we are
192:43 - actually going to design is this drop
192:45 - down
192:46 - so to show you what this is i'm going to
192:48 - press shift 2
192:50 - and basically we want this to have two
192:52 - options one is when the drop down is
192:54 - closed and then the other is when drop
192:56 - down is open and it shows date picker so
193:00 - basically we will have one state where
193:03 - the property is open
193:05 - or
193:06 - meaning is the
193:08 - drop down open and it's a yes or no
193:10 - value so let's do that
193:14 - that's basically
193:17 - go
193:18 - here press f
193:20 - and
193:22 - do and right drop down
193:25 - and then i'm gonna press f
193:28 - and before that maybe change the color
193:30 - of background to be this
193:33 - and i'm gonna then
193:35 - go to the draw go
193:37 - zoom in shift to
193:39 - and then i'm going to close the benefit
193:43 - card and i'm going to find the drop
193:45 - downs
193:46 - and i'm going to add a fill to the
193:50 - white and i'm going to make this 8 and
193:52 - i'm going to make sure we have white 100
193:56 - and i'm gonna get its height to be 40
193:58 - pixels as that is the standard
194:02 - height we have for the
194:04 - most elements and then i'm gonna make
194:06 - its
194:06 - overshadow to be 16 pixels on blur
194:09 - and 10 percent here perfect
194:12 - and i'm gonna probably get its split to
194:14 - be 327.
194:18 - just in case it takes the whole bit of
194:20 - the
194:21 - available content area on the iphone 13
194:24 - mini
194:26 - and then i know it has a text label so
194:28 - it should be like
194:31 - pick a day
194:34 - and
194:37 - let's think this true and i'm going to
194:39 - zoom out a bit
194:41 - because i'm realizing maybe there is
194:42 - more than two values
194:45 - so i think there is two more than two
194:47 - values because or maybe there's two but
194:50 - when it's closed you have to select a
194:52 - day but when it's open
194:54 - you actually
194:56 - you
194:59 - actually have to have here an actual
195:02 - date
195:03 - okay so
195:04 - there is a mistake here in this design
195:08 - where
195:09 - so can you see even if the person picked
195:12 - the 30th it should actually write 30
195:15 - june 2022 but the design here is wrong
195:18 - so
195:20 - so the drop down can have multiple
195:22 - values in the first
195:24 - i think that there are okay there's two
195:26 - different properties the first one is
195:28 - this is the drop down open or closed
195:32 - but the second one is does the drop down
195:34 - already have a date or not if it doesn't
195:37 - you should write select the dates but
195:39 - the dropdown also might have a date that
195:41 - was picked but we wanted to change so we
195:44 - will have open we will have s properties
195:48 - open
195:49 - and we will also have date packed or not
195:52 - yeah so that would give us roughly four
195:54 - versions so i'm gonna go here
195:58 - i'm gonna zoom in here and i'm gonna add
196:00 - the in the assets the chevron
196:04 - we have
196:05 - from the icon set let's begin with the
196:09 - share run down
196:11 - and let's pick its color to be dark
196:13 - [Music]
196:14 - blue let's pick this color to be dark
196:17 - blue as well
196:21 - and then let's check the distance here
196:24 - that is 12
196:27 - and 15 15 and let's give this the
196:31 - 15 auto
196:33 - and that's pretty good and we want this
196:36 - to be 12 as well
196:39 - so this will require a bit zooming in
196:41 - here to find out
196:44 - all right so
196:46 - in here we have 11 and there is five
196:48 - pixels so
196:50 - we really want to go
196:53 - maybe seven
196:56 - yeah i think that's right so and then we
196:59 - want to go 12 here
197:01 - i think that should give us this
197:03 - that should give us 12 by 12 left and
197:06 - right
197:06 - that's pretty good
197:08 - so pick a day i don't need the auto
197:11 - layout here because the date will never
197:12 - be that long
197:14 - so i think i will just make this a frame
197:16 - now with the ctrl alt
197:19 - g
197:20 - and i'm going to write this drop down
197:24 - and then i'm going to make this a
197:26 - component with ctrl alt k
197:31 - and then what i'm going to do is
197:34 - i
197:35 - actually will
197:37 - give this a variant
197:38 - here
197:40 - and
197:41 - i will give the property the first
197:44 - property to be
197:46 - open
197:49 - oops
197:52 - open and i will go to the more menu add
197:55 - new property and that is
197:58 - has date
198:01 - or let's say picked date
198:05 - okay
198:07 - so let's do this so
198:10 - so let's say select the day here is
198:13 - better
198:14 - select
198:15 - okay so for this one what we have is is
198:18 - it open no
198:21 - is a date picked no
198:24 - and the second one what we can do is
198:27 - we can actually pick a date where we can
198:29 - say 20 22
198:31 - june 20 22
198:33 - and what this means is we are are we
198:36 - open no
198:37 - have we picked the date yes
198:40 - and then what we can do is we need two
198:42 - more of these
198:45 - and so we will have four variations
198:48 - and in this one we are also are we open
198:53 - yes and when we are open we do not
198:57 - and let's say let's pick the date no
198:59 - when we are open the share run down icon
199:02 - actually has to turn into the share run
199:04 - up icon
199:05 - so we need to get rid of the share run
199:07 - down
199:08 - we go to our assets
199:11 - and we get a share run up icon
199:15 - and yes that is the way
199:19 - and i'm gonna remove this so that's the
199:22 - share run down and i'm gonna just
199:25 - basically give this to be the same x
199:27 - coordinate
199:30 - 296.
199:34 - and i'm going to check if it's equal it
199:36 - is equal
199:38 - and
199:39 - then what i'm going to do is i'm gonna
199:43 - press and now i want this to be picked
199:46 - yes and i'm gonna give this
199:49 - 20 20 to june
199:52 - 2022 and that's all of our options guys
200:00 - good morning everybody so let's actually
200:03 - move on
200:05 - with the
200:06 - looking at the scheduling sessions i'm
200:08 - gonna show you here
200:10 - so before we actually get to design
200:12 - these screens there's one more variant
200:14 - we need to actually
200:16 - finish and that is the date picker you
200:19 - can see this element i'm gonna zoom in
200:21 - by pressing shift two and you can see
200:26 - the state picker and basically what
200:28 - happens if any user decides to pick a
200:31 - day for their activity they click on the
200:34 - apple drop down and this opens up and
200:36 - they get to pick the month the date etc
200:40 - now the
200:43 - hard part with this element is actually
200:46 - the content of the days
200:48 - because you actually have two ways to
200:50 - visually create this content you might
200:52 - actually do it column by column like
200:55 - this horizontally or you might do a draw
200:57 - by row by row and to keep each spacing
201:01 - equal you have to use auto layout
201:03 - otherwise you have like 60 margins that
201:06 - you have to align yourself between each
201:09 - date like between 1 2 and 1 8 and 8 9
201:12 - and 8 15 and this just cascades
201:15 - and for me i found it much easier to do
201:19 - auto layout with the row by row solution
201:22 - so that's what we are going to do now
201:24 - before we design again we have to think
201:27 - what are the states of the speaker in
201:29 - terms of variance and there is two
201:31 - states as far as i can see the first is
201:35 - basically a date picker that doesn't
201:37 - have a picked date yet which is this
201:39 - side
201:40 - and the second one is a date picker that
201:43 - has a picked date which is this one
201:45 - where we have the blue color
201:47 - so that's what we are actually going to
201:50 - do
201:51 - and i'm looking at what we need and one
201:53 - of the things we need right now is this
201:55 - right chevron but if you look at here we
201:58 - don't have a right share run on our icon
202:00 - set so we actually have to go back that
202:03 - was a mistake by me so we actually will
202:05 - go scroll here
202:07 - go to our icon set
202:09 - and let's look at here so let's see
202:14 - this one here
202:17 - and i think what we need is we actually
202:20 - got the same one
202:22 - so what we need is a right share run so
202:24 - i'm going to right click
202:26 - go to plugins
202:27 - and we will go to fedora accounts which
202:29 - was the plugin we used to actually fetch
202:32 - our icon set and we are going to write
202:34 - chevron
202:36 - and i want the right chair run here and
202:39 - i got it
202:40 - that's pretty good i'm going to my
202:42 - layers now
202:44 - and the hard part really is that
202:49 - with figma sometimes it's difficult to
202:52 - actually put
202:54 - things like plug-in icons into the
202:56 - what would you say
202:58 - into the frames because they don't you
203:00 - they don't put it usually often so like
203:02 - it put it outside of our icon set frame
203:05 - even though we put we actually fetched
203:07 - it inside so sometimes you have to do
203:09 - this manually like this
203:11 - go and put it there and once we got it
203:14 - we have a few things to change again our
203:16 - color is never black we want dark blue
203:20 - and then what we also want is that we
203:22 - want the stroke width to be one pixel
203:25 - so i'm gonna go inside and i'm gonna
203:27 - pick fun
203:28 - and now that that's done we will
203:30 - actually make this a component by ctrl
203:34 - alt k
203:36 - so now again ctrl alt k
203:38 - so now our chevron write is a component
203:41 - and it should show up in our assets you
203:44 - know
203:45 - panel
203:46 - and let's look and it's there all right
203:49 - so we are ready and done with our icons
203:52 - so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
203:54 - actually create the frame that will hold
203:56 - the variant so for it i'm going to press
203:59 - f for frame shortcut
204:01 - and i'm going to write here date picker
204:05 - and that's all good and swell so then
204:08 - what i want to do is
204:10 - i want you to take a very good look at
204:12 - this visual
204:14 - because what we have here is basically
204:17 - seven
204:19 - lines i seem like monday tuesday
204:21 - wednesday thursday fridays
204:23 - saturday and sunday and we have at most
204:25 - six rows so we have seven columns six
204:28 - rows
204:30 - and how we are going to do the design is
204:32 - basically row by row by row so it will
204:35 - be like
204:36 - row here row here row here
204:39 - okay i think i made a mistake i think i
204:43 - should have done it fit the column i
204:44 - think i'm mixing what i call them in a
204:46 - row is and i apologize for that guys but
204:48 - let's look at my solution okay so i
204:51 - think i did it by
204:52 - column by column right yes this is a
204:55 - column this is a column this is a column
204:58 - okay column by column is a solution and
205:00 - i named them wrong these are all columns
205:03 - so that's what i will do column by
205:05 - column by
205:07 - i apologize guys
205:09 - it's been a long tutorial
205:12 - all right so let's go
205:15 - all right so i'm gonna go here
205:18 - and i'm gonna first change the
205:19 - background color to this match this one
205:22 - and then i'm gonna get
205:24 - i'm gonna zoom in with shift two and i'm
205:27 - gonna press f to create my frame parent
205:29 - frame and this is gonna be 200
205:32 - 327 pixels we know this because it
205:35 - stretches to the left and right sides of
205:38 - the margin of the screen
205:39 - and for the height we are going to give
205:41 - it right now 256 pixels
205:44 - now i don't know if that is good enough
205:46 - we might increase it if we need to but
205:48 - let's go so i'm going to fill it with
205:50 - our white color and i'm going to
205:52 - actually add a border radius of 8 pixels
205:56 - it already started looking nice i'm
205:57 - adding a drop shadow
205:59 - 4
206:00 - 16 10 percent which is our general drop
206:04 - shadow and now what we can do here is
206:08 - this
206:10 - we can press t to add the text let's say
206:14 - june 2022
206:16 - and i'm gonna make this a
206:19 - basically a regular
206:22 - sub header
206:24 - and i can have it here
206:26 - and i'm gonna make this autobit
206:30 - that's pretty good and then what i can
206:33 - do is i can actually fetch my icons that
206:36 - will let the user pick the amount they
206:38 - want to pick on the right side here they
206:40 - might select on the right side so i'm
206:42 - going to get my share on left
206:44 - and i'm gonna get my chevron right
206:48 - okay
206:49 - so chevron right was a bit harder but we
206:53 - got it
206:54 - and i'm gonna actually maybe get these
206:57 - guys a bit more
206:58 - closer now maybe a bit above
207:03 - all right
207:04 - so
207:05 - then what i want to do is i want to
207:08 - do my first column so that would be with
207:12 - t
207:14 - and what i'm gonna do here is
207:18 - basically
207:20 - i'm gonna do
207:22 - m
207:23 - and
207:24 - i'm gonna make each of these
207:27 - take the autobit and it won't be a
207:29 - subheader it will actually be a regular
207:32 - body text and i'm going to zoom in now
207:35 - so what we need here is
207:38 - so this is m for monday and what we need
207:41 - here is first 8 15 22 and 29th of the
207:46 - month
207:47 - so then i'm going to like have to drag
207:49 - this basically and this is going to be
207:51 - one
207:53 - and this
207:55 - is gonna be eight
207:58 - and ahmet are these dates accurate for
208:01 - june 2022 i don't know
208:05 - i didn't check the calendar
208:07 - maybe they are maybe they aren't but i
208:09 - don't think it matters much
208:11 - this is a prototype after all but it is
208:13 - 29
208:14 - and that's the first column
208:18 - so what we want is that we actually
208:22 - want to make this a group here
208:25 - so we want to do this we want to frame
208:28 - this
208:30 - and we want to make this the first
208:32 - column
208:35 - all right so first column works
208:38 - and then we wanna basically
208:41 - duplicate this
208:42 - but first let's give it a bits of
208:44 - spacing so between each element we might
208:47 - want 12
208:48 - and we probably want them to be right
208:51 - aligned
208:53 - yeah i think i like to write a line
208:55 - better maybe center might also work
208:59 - and we will figure out what kind of an
209:01 - alignment we want but we can check our
209:03 - solution again if i did center or light
209:07 - so let's check it
209:11 - okay i think we did center in the
209:12 - solution which is fine
209:14 - sometimes you can also do write a line
209:16 - if it suits you it really is your call
209:19 - but one thing i want to do is i want to
209:20 - make the first m which is the date
209:23 - to actually be body bold
209:28 - and i also want each of the text color
209:31 - to be dark blue not black
209:34 - yes
209:35 - i want this to be dark blue as well
209:39 - okay
209:40 - so that looks actually not bad so i'm
209:42 - going to actually drag this to duplicate
209:46 - and i'm going to drag this okay i'm
209:48 - holding shift so that my horizontal
209:50 - alignment doesn't change four
209:54 - five
209:56 - six
209:58 - and don't worry about the horizontal
209:59 - spacing between each column we will
210:02 - actually accomplish that when we frame
210:05 - each of these columns into a parent
210:07 - frame and that will let us put
210:09 - horizontal spacing
210:11 - distribution the way we wanted
210:13 - so this is actually so i'm gonna go
210:16 - tuesday
210:17 - and this is 2
210:21 - 9
210:24 - 16
210:26 - 23
210:30 - 30
210:31 - and this one will be 3
210:35 - 10
210:38 - 17
210:40 - 24 and 31st so any element after this
210:45 - actually we made a mistake
210:47 - will not have the last
210:49 - row
210:50 - because 31st is the most you can go
210:54 - so what we will do is we will remove
210:56 - this
210:58 - and we will actually drag this one
211:01 - and this one
211:03 - and this one yes so that's monday
211:06 - tuesday wednesday
211:08 - thursday
211:10 - friday
211:11 - saturday and
211:13 - sunday
211:15 - yeah i think that looks pretty good
211:18 - so
211:19 - excuse me let me just drink this tea
211:23 - it's very early in the morning so i need
211:25 - my energy okay so 2 9 3 10 17 24 31st
211:30 - this should be 4
211:32 - 11.
211:33 - if i make any mistakes guys please don't
211:36 - tell me
211:38 - i'm kidding you can't tell me
211:40 - we all make mistakes it's okay
211:42 - especially this early in the morning
211:44 - this is 12 this is 19
211:48 - and this is 26.
211:50 - i definitely made the typo summer
211:53 - 6
211:54 - 13
211:56 - 20
211:58 - and 27
212:01 - and then here is 7 14
212:04 - 7 14 21
212:09 - 28
212:11 - okay that looks pretty good
212:13 - all right so now
212:16 - what i want to do is i wanna
212:19 - select all these columns that we did and
212:22 - i want to frame these by with the
212:24 - shortcut ctrl alt g
212:27 - and this is the dates frame
212:30 - and i will what i will do is i'm going
212:33 - to check the spacing between each
212:35 - element here which is 12 pixel and they
212:36 - are centered
212:38 - and what i will now do is that i am
212:41 - going to
212:42 - add an auto layout to this parent frame
212:44 - and i'm going to make this 12 as well
212:46 - now
212:48 - ahmet is 12 enough
212:50 - probably not because if you think about
212:52 - a person is going to use this app on
212:55 - their mobile phone and you probably want
212:58 - a much more margin between each number
213:01 - because you want this to be very easy to
213:04 - tap between thumbs so let's try 16
213:10 - for the columns as well so let's try 16
213:13 - here
213:18 - so i'm gonna just go through all columns
213:20 - here
213:24 - and
213:25 - yes i'm gonna go through all columns
213:27 - here
213:28 - so 16. so what i'm going to do is i
213:31 - might speed up this portion of the video
213:33 - i'm just going to go through each column
213:34 - and make these 16
213:36 - and
213:37 - i will see when the
213:38 - actual design of the dates are done
213:45 - yeah i think that looks pretty good
213:48 - so now another thing we need is our
213:50 - cancel button but also
213:53 - before that we should realize that 256
213:56 - wasn't enough
213:58 - so i'm gonna actually add 32 pixels
214:00 - there to 888
214:02 - that might be better and even this might
214:04 - not be enough but let's see so another
214:07 - thing that our actual element needs is
214:09 - the
214:11 - small secondary buttons so i'm gonna
214:13 - show shift to
214:14 - so look at here we need the cancel and
214:17 - the done button and then we will also
214:20 - add these circles that the
214:23 - basically if a circle is not filled it
214:25 - signals what day it is right now unlike
214:28 - the time you are using the app and the
214:31 - blue circle that is filled means that
214:33 - that's the data you actually pick the
214:34 - activity to do
214:37 - so
214:38 - here is a good question that the
214:40 - previous design here didn't answer if
214:43 - you are on 29th june 2022
214:48 - should you be eligible to pick the dates
214:50 - beforehand you already cannot go back in
214:52 - time
214:54 - so that is actually a design mistake
214:57 - you already cannot go back in time how
214:59 - can you be on 29 june and have the
215:02 - option to select previous days
215:05 - whoa that's a past mistake for me
215:08 - all right yes let's let's correct that
215:10 - shall we
215:11 - let's let's do better
215:13 - yes that's the motto let's do better
215:16 - so
215:17 - first we are what i'm going to do is i
215:19 - am actually going to add our buttons
215:21 - first i'm going to get our small buttons
215:24 - and i'm gonna make this active yes this
215:27 - is gonna be a secondary button
215:30 - and this is gonna be
215:32 - cancel
215:35 - yep
215:36 - and cancel looks pretty good
215:38 - and then i'm gonna duplicate this by
215:40 - dragging
215:43 - and this is gonna be a primary button
215:47 - saying
215:48 - done
215:51 - okay
215:52 - so far so good
215:54 - 288 is definitely not enough maybe three
215:58 - or four
215:59 - okay so now what i'm gonna do is
216:02 - i am going to pick a date here
216:06 - and i am basically going to let's say we
216:09 - are on the date 16th okay
216:12 - so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna press
216:14 - all
216:16 - and i'm gonna put it oops my bad i'm
216:20 - going to press o and i'm going to put it
216:22 - around here
216:23 - and this is going to be 24 to 24
216:28 - maybe 32
216:30 - 32
216:32 - and it's gonna have
216:34 - no insights and it's gonna have a blue
216:37 - around now i'm not gonna put it inside
216:39 - our date frame because the moment i do
216:42 - it will try to arrange it to like a date
216:44 - and our alignments here will get messed
216:47 - up so one simple trick you can do on
216:49 - ping maze i'm just gonna use the
216:51 - coordinates to pick a date so i'm gonna
216:53 - go to left
216:56 - so i'm going to literally i'm holding
216:58 - shift so i can move 10 pixels at a time
217:00 - and i'm gonna go up here
217:04 - and i'm not gonna align it like this
217:08 - maybe here
217:10 - and that looks pretty good
217:14 - and i think this one is also supposed to
217:17 - be like
217:19 - blue here
217:20 - that's the date you are on and any date
217:23 - before 16 means that it's not eligible
217:25 - for you so i am actually gonna
217:29 - almost make each of these dates to be
217:33 - like the gray
217:34 - yes
217:36 - so i'm gonna make these gray
217:38 - which is a disabled color that we have
217:41 - so that is 3 4 10
217:45 - and i'm sharing these mistakes with you
217:48 - guys instead of redesigning everything
217:50 - because
217:51 - i think it is good to see other
217:53 - designers i actually am a full-time
217:55 - designer and i make mistakes all the
217:58 - time man i make mistakes all the time
218:01 - and i think it is a very good thing for
218:03 - beginner or even mid levels to see that
218:06 - other people are making mistakes while
218:08 - still having a career and that's fine
218:11 - that's how we learn i think it's a very
218:13 - important thing
218:15 - so
218:15 - now the first day from the first to 15
218:18 - is actually disabled we are on 16th
218:21 - and that's the first version of the
218:24 - let's say design that we have now we can
218:27 - actually worry about the small things
218:29 - like spacing
218:30 - so
218:31 - what i'm checking now is i'm checking
218:33 - the distance between everything i want
218:36 - this to be probably 16
218:39 - or maybe even 12 nothing is 60 i'm gonna
218:41 - check our card design to see
218:43 - how what was the difference there like
218:46 - what was the margin left and right
218:48 - because we want to repeat that for
218:49 - consistency
218:51 - so i'm checking here and it was 12 by
218:53 - 12.
218:54 - okay
218:55 - so let's do 12.
218:57 - i'm going to go here shift 2
219:00 - zoom in a bit more
219:02 - and let's go here 12 by 12.
219:05 - so i'm gonna do
219:08 - 12 here
219:10 - 12 there
219:11 - and i want to make sure
219:14 - that
219:16 - that is roughly 12 but that should
219:18 - probably be eight
219:20 - for the text
219:22 - what's happening
219:24 - oh like eight
219:27 - yes
219:28 - and
219:29 - both of these guys can actually go
219:32 - here
219:34 - and i'm gonna check the distance here
219:38 - and that should probably be a bit closer
219:40 - because of the surrounding box
219:42 - and
219:43 - i'm gonna check here
219:45 - okay so that's roughly 9 12 that is
219:49 - correct
219:50 - and with these icons you usually eyeball
219:52 - it if you are very very
219:55 - detailed you can just zoom in and count
219:56 - all of the rectangles which is what i
219:58 - usually do
220:00 - but
220:01 - let's
220:02 - get this to be and let's see if it looks
220:05 - like
220:06 - it is so let's select both of these
220:08 - elements
220:10 - okay so it's almost like it is hitting
220:12 - the baseline there which is the where
220:14 - the most weight of this font like it's
220:16 - not the baseline but
220:18 - where is the most
220:20 - weight
220:21 - of this font of this type street that
220:24 - which is in the
220:26 - like around here right it's like it is
220:29 - not here because most of the focus of
220:31 - this font because we are using a
220:33 - lowercase for most of the letters is
220:35 - here
220:36 - and that makes it look pretty centered
220:39 - because that's where the
220:40 - middle part of this meets
220:43 - and i'm going to check the distance
220:45 - maybe get it here
220:48 - maybe i think this separation is pretty
220:51 - good so that
220:53 - the
220:54 - elements actually maybe they can be a
220:57 - bit closer
220:59 - yeah
221:00 - i think that's a bit better yeah i think
221:02 - that is better
221:04 - and
221:05 - another thing that we can do now is
221:08 - we can also check our spacing here
221:11 - so we probably want to go to 12 as well
221:15 - that is not good so that is yeah that's
221:19 - pretty okay
221:20 - now
221:21 - we might not be able to do 12 because
221:24 - now the problem is that while we are
221:27 - consistent with our card design spacing
221:30 - the hard part is that
221:33 - our outer spacing is much more than the
221:36 - inner spacing we have between each state
221:38 - right the the
221:40 - the marginal difference between 16 and
221:42 - 17 is 16 pixels while the whole parent
221:46 - frame at most has 12 pixel difference
221:48 - which is why it makes it look like we
221:50 - are very squished so you want to really
221:52 - have
221:53 - parent margins to be bigger so probably
221:56 - we will go with 24 and break the
221:58 - consistency
221:59 - so that should be like 20 here
222:02 - and 24 here
222:05 - and that should be like
222:11 - here
222:12 - and we should take it also here
222:16 - yes that looks a bit better and let's
222:18 - make this go 24
222:21 - maybe for alignment 22 yes
222:24 - and let's get you guys to here
222:29 - and let's look at your bottom and let's
222:31 - move you guys up a bit as well
222:34 - and that is
222:36 - so the distance between these two
222:38 - elements is 12 pixels 8 plus 4 that is
222:42 - 12.
222:44 - that is a pretty good distance
222:48 - so
222:49 - what we can do is we can actually check
222:52 - again
222:53 - 12 so
222:56 - like
222:57 - it's almost
222:58 - good and you can see this element
223:01 - actually
223:02 - isn't doing the like it's not fully
223:04 - scratched i think it looks pretty good
223:06 - right now in terms of spacing
223:08 - i'm eyeballing it a bit but it looks
223:10 - pretty good the problem here is that the
223:13 - circle our circle around the 16 is not
223:16 - centered now and it is bugging me so it
223:19 - should be maybe around here
223:22 - nope around here
223:26 - yes
223:29 - no around here yes
223:31 - i think this now looks better and what
223:34 - i'm going to do is basically i'm going
223:36 - to write this as
223:39 - i think we did it is the date picker
223:41 - right yes
223:44 - picker
223:46 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
223:47 - make this a component now
223:52 - oops sorry i'm going to make this a
223:54 - component with the ctrl alt k i don't
223:56 - want to frame a frame i want to make the
223:58 - frame a component and that let's
224:00 - substitute the variance so
224:03 - remember from the beginning of the video
224:06 - we know that they will only have two
224:08 - state states the first one is that the
224:10 - date hasn't picked it is not in pick has
224:14 - not been packed the second state is that
224:16 - the date is picked so for that
224:20 - we need the property of
224:23 - date picked
224:24 - so
224:26 - date picked
224:29 - and for this one it's a no
224:33 - and for this one it should be a yes and
224:36 - we should change stuff
224:39 - so
224:40 - what we should do is let's say the user
224:43 - also let's click let's drag this
224:49 - okay that won't work
224:51 - so
224:52 - let's make a copy of it and let's just
224:55 - basically drag it here
224:57 - let's just say they did 18
225:01 - and i'm gonna press shift x to swap the
225:04 - value
225:05 - that didn't work why is that
225:09 - okay so for some reason figma doesn't
225:11 - let me swap values i can do it the old
225:13 - way
225:15 - i can do it like this
225:18 - and the hard part here is that my circle
225:21 - has to be below my dates which is what
225:24 - i'm gonna do so that the date is visible
225:27 - and i'm gonna press for this one i'm
225:29 - gonna make this white
225:31 - and i think i'm gonna make this bold as
225:32 - well
225:34 - yes that looks a bit better
225:36 - and i think that looks like a selected
225:38 - circle
225:39 - yes that looks like a selected date i
225:41 - think that looks pretty good
225:43 - i think i like what i'm seeing
225:46 - what is the
225:48 - horizontal margin between these two
225:50 - maybe it should be 12.
225:53 - i really don't want it to be not
225:55 - multiples of 4 12
225:58 - and that looks pretty good actually
226:02 - so that is our date picker
226:08 - all right so let's get started with our
226:11 - first two screens for the scheduling
226:14 - ones so what i'm gonna do is
226:17 - like always i'm gonna create my initial
226:19 - frame
226:20 - so i'm gonna press f
226:22 - and i'm gonna pick iphone 13 mini
226:25 - and i'm gonna fetch it here
226:28 - and i can do this as schedule
226:32 - part one
226:34 - now here are the elements that we
226:37 - already designed
226:40 - for our variants to actually for the
226:42 - screen is we have the status bar done we
226:44 - have our button is done i think we might
226:47 - not have the disabled version i will
226:48 - check but our large button is mostly
226:51 - done we have the bottom navigation and
226:53 - we have the date drop down now what we
226:56 - are missing is the stepper functionality
226:59 - for the adults and children here now
227:03 - i do not think these will actually need
227:06 - to be variants or the stepper function
227:09 - needs to be actually variant because
227:12 - now we are not using it as any other
227:14 - parts of the application you might
227:17 - actually make this in the future for a
227:18 - variant but for this tutorial's sake and
227:21 - to
227:21 - maybe not
227:23 - prolong it any further i'm not going to
227:25 - actually make the data variant i'm just
227:27 - going to design it here but as a
227:29 - homework if you want to bonus points
227:31 - from me and show me later and email your
227:33 - work to me you can make the variant on
227:36 - your own so what i'm gonna do is i'm
227:38 - gonna just add our stuff
227:40 - that we have to use so like the i'm
227:43 - gonna move my profile here and i'm going
227:46 - to add the status bar let's say
227:49 - here
227:50 - i am going to where is my button i'm
227:52 - going to add the drop down here
227:55 - where is my bottom navigation
227:58 - show me where is it oh it's here
228:01 - okay
228:02 - so i'm gonna add this okay so the bottom
228:05 - navigations coordinates is
228:08 - 760.
228:11 - and that looks pretty good and this one
228:13 - should be
228:14 - zero
228:16 - zero
228:17 - yep and that looks pretty good and then
228:20 - what i can do is
228:23 - i can actually
228:26 - get the from my icon set i'm gonna get
228:28 - the left share run which actually lets
228:30 - us go back one step
228:32 - so
228:33 - what i'm gonna do is i am gonna go find
228:36 - our icon set and i'm gonna drag the
228:38 - chevron left right here
228:41 - and i'm gonna go to my layers
228:44 - and that worked subliminally pretty well
228:47 - and i'm gonna get this to be like 16
228:51 - or let's see let's see from here what
228:54 - was the coordinates so 16 yes i was
228:56 - right
228:58 - so then we can get it here this would be
229:01 - 24
229:03 - and so far so good i am now gonna check
229:06 - our
229:07 - i'm gonna check our large buttons to see
229:10 - if we have a disabled version
229:13 - if not meaning disabled variant if not
229:15 - we will need to design some stuff and we
229:18 - do
229:18 - okay i'm proud of us so we actually have
229:21 - that one
229:22 - so now i can also then that means i can
229:25 - also shift to i can drop our large
229:28 - button as well
229:30 - and i can disable this it's not active
229:33 - no
229:35 - so
229:36 - let's look again and this is the go to
229:38 - checkout part
229:41 - to
229:42 - check out
229:43 - all right and it's centered perfect
229:47 - so the only thing that remains now is to
229:50 - design the things that are not variants
229:52 - so
229:54 - for the text the main text schedule
229:56 - active i'm going to press t
229:58 - and i'm going to write schedule
230:01 - activity
230:03 - and i'm going to left align this and i'm
230:06 - gonna basically make to say
230:08 - i'm gonna move myself here and i'm gonna
230:11 - make this a top header bold
230:14 - and i'm gonna get you here yes
230:18 - and i'm gonna make this autobit
230:20 - and i am gonna definitely change this
230:23 - color from black to dark blue so it
230:25 - matches with our color palette
230:28 - and then what i'm going to do is i am
230:31 - gonna design this frame
230:34 - so it looks like it will have 327 pixels
230:38 - because it stretches
230:40 - horizontally
230:41 - and i'm going to fill it
230:43 - and i'm going to flip it to our white
230:44 - color
230:46 - and i'm definitely going to add the drop
230:48 - shadow because it's hard to see the
230:50 - white it's 4 to 16 pixels
230:53 - 10 percent and yes
230:56 - i definitely need border radius of 8
230:58 - pixels which is what we usually have for
231:00 - the rectangle elements
231:02 - and that looks pretty good i think it
231:05 - will be taller so maybe 128 pixels
231:10 - yeah that is that might be too tall
231:12 - maybe 1008
231:14 - and we will figure it out but the first
231:16 - things i want to do is i want to add the
231:19 - adult texture so this is basically
231:23 - the
231:24 - user selecting how many adults how many
231:27 - children how many people they will bring
231:30 - for the activity is it just you and your
231:31 - partner or is it just you
231:33 - or do you have a kid with you so
231:36 - i'm gonna make this also dark blue
231:40 - and i'm gonna make it out of it as
231:42 - well and
231:45 - what i'm trying to gauge here is
231:49 - let's zoom into the screen
231:53 - and that looks actually pretty
231:57 - okay i think we might need a double
231:59 - like
232:01 - no maybe not
232:03 - maybe
232:04 - yes
232:05 - all right so what we can do now is we
232:08 - can press r for rectangle
232:11 - and this is probably is the hardest part
232:14 - of this
232:17 - of this video because we are creating an
232:20 - element from scratch this probably has
232:23 - 48 pixels for height
232:25 - maybe not 48 but 40.
232:28 - yeah 48 might be a stretch
232:31 - i'm looking and 48 looks big maybe we
232:33 - thought with the border radius it might
232:35 - look smaller but
232:37 - now 48 is definitely back maybe 44
232:44 - no maybe 40 is it 44 or 40 it's 40 yes
232:48 - because 48 was big so 40 pixels
232:53 - and
232:54 - even with that one we probably want the
232:57 - background to be blue
232:59 - ish and okay so then we want our stepper
233:03 - functionality minus m plus i'm gonna
233:06 - press r again
233:08 - and we might want these to be 32
233:12 - by 32
233:14 - and i probably want this to be eight
233:17 - oops
233:18 - i probably want the border radius to be
233:20 - eight as well
233:23 - whoa eight is too much maybe four
233:26 - yeah
233:27 - four is better and i want this blue to
233:29 - be a bit darker maybe even 300 nope 300
233:33 - is too much maybe 200 yes
233:36 - i need 200 is pretty good
233:38 - and i'm gonna drag this
233:41 - and i'm gonna basically
233:45 - take this one pixel down so it's four
233:47 - four four
233:49 - and take this one pixel to right so it's
233:51 - four four four and at the center of it
233:54 - will be our text
233:55 - so yes to t
233:58 - and let's write this zero
234:00 - and i'm gonna have this to be bolded
234:03 - actually
234:05 - i'm going to have this to be bolded
234:07 - i'm going to have the centered
234:09 - and i'm going to have this autobit
234:12 - and i'm going to check the distance it
234:14 - has
234:15 - and maybe here
234:18 - it's seven to six so it's 259.5
234:23 - and that is centered now i'm going to
234:26 - check the vertical spacing here and i'm
234:29 - going to zoom in to see that's three
234:31 - that's four so it should actually have
234:33 - one more pixel in the up
234:35 - so it should probably be here
234:38 - for centered
234:41 - no sorry
234:42 - my bad
234:44 - it should be around here
234:46 - okay
234:47 - so
234:48 - that
234:50 - let's check our work so far
234:52 - okay we need to get the icon
234:55 - i get that
234:57 - okay so
234:58 - maybe let's check it
235:02 - okay so we need our icons
235:04 - so i'm gonna go to our icons on our
235:06 - assets panel
235:08 - and i realize we actually do not
235:11 - have the minus four plus icon so
235:14 - let's go to our icon set very quickly
235:18 - and fetch those
235:21 - so i'm going to icon set shift 2 to
235:24 - shift
235:26 - shift 2 to zoom in oh what did i do
235:30 - okay so we are here
235:31 - shift two
235:33 - so i'm gonna right click plugins and i'm
235:35 - gonna
235:37 - basically check for feather icons
235:39 - i'm gonna check for plus
235:47 - and i'm checking for minus
235:55 - okay so i think i got both of these
235:58 - icons so one of them is in right now
236:02 - i don't think the plus is in the icon
236:05 - set but i think we can just by going
236:07 - down here so i have to drag the plus one
236:11 - okay so they are both in
236:13 - so both of their colors should be dark
236:15 - blue
236:16 - and i'm gonna make you guys go here
236:18 - and i'm gonna select both of them and
236:20 - make them a component
236:22 - oops
236:24 - make them a component and that's pretty
236:27 - good
236:29 - and
236:30 - oh they just okay my mistake
236:34 - i have to make them okay figma doesn't
236:36 - make you do a component for each so ctrl
236:39 - alt k for this one
236:41 - ctrl alt k for this one okay now it
236:43 - works now we are good
236:45 - so let's go back to our screen
236:48 - click on the screen shift tool to zoom
236:50 - in
236:52 - and let's just add
236:54 - from our assets panel our newly minted
236:57 - icons
236:59 - this
237:00 - is the minus
237:02 - and this is the plus
237:07 - okay
237:08 - those look pretty good let's make these
237:11 - all white
237:14 - and let's
237:16 - basically also
237:19 - make these guys have one pixel so i'm
237:21 - gonna have to go back because we didn't
237:23 - change their stroke yet
237:26 - so i'm actually going back to the icon
237:28 - set i know guys this is frustrating
237:31 - this is my mistake yes so that's one
237:34 - pixel
237:36 - ah they are both going to be one pixel
237:40 - and this is one pixel as well
237:42 - okay now we are good i know we are good
237:44 - enough
237:45 - again click on the screen shift to zoom
237:47 - in
237:49 - okay
237:50 - that looks better
237:53 - so let's look at this is this
237:56 - centered here
237:58 - i'm gonna basically grab this and make
238:00 - these two things an element so ctrl g to
238:04 - group
238:04 - and what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna
238:08 - basically center both of these elements
238:11 - i'm gonna also do this for the plus side
238:14 - and then i'm gonna click both of them
238:16 - and center them
238:19 - yes that looks pretty good
238:22 - and then what i want to do is i want to
238:24 - name this sd
238:29 - yeah that part isn't useful i think we
238:32 - duplicated something that was necessary
238:33 - i'm going to name this background
238:36 - and that looks to me pretty good
238:40 - let's look at our example here i think
238:44 - our steppers can be a bit smaller
238:47 - but so here is the thing if we make it
238:50 - smaller they will also be harder to tap
238:53 - so this is really your decision if we
238:56 - get them smaller now they will
238:58 - aesthetically look better
239:00 - but then being big enough also might
239:02 - give the person a confidence to actually
239:05 - try to tap because they are bigger now
239:07 - 32 pixels i think in the design there
239:09 - are 24 there in the way i did it
239:12 - but there is also benefits to having it
239:15 - at the size
239:17 - so i think i will just keep it at size
239:20 - for the usability
239:22 - and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
239:26 - design this by 12 pixel
239:31 - and definitely like eight or nine
239:36 - so i'm gonna zoom in here
239:40 - yeah definitely 89 here
239:42 - okay maybe 16 will be the way to go
239:46 - but then you might realize for you to
239:49 - solve this is a actually a good dilemma
239:52 - so
239:55 - so for you to actually
239:57 - center design these elements which is
240:01 - like the stepper
240:04 - elements
240:09 - oh
240:10 - we haven't grouped those yet okay my bad
240:12 - that's not the element
240:16 - okay so let's first make this a group
240:18 - shall we
240:21 - with the background and this
240:23 - is our stepper functionality
240:27 - so we will make this a frame
240:30 - and this is stepper
240:32 - and let's check if everything moves with
240:34 - it when we move it yes
240:36 - okay so we want to center design these
240:39 - two elements the adult and the
240:42 - stepper functionality and let's copy
240:45 - them and i'm going to show you a visual
240:46 - problem
240:48 - now what is and we have to grow this
240:50 - size it's 128. so what is the visual
240:53 - problem here now while the
240:56 - figma is telling you the distance is
240:59 - equal
241:00 - between
241:01 - the each row the problem your eye is
241:04 - having is the vertical space between
241:07 - adult to let's say children here
241:11 - is a lot more than the stepper
241:14 - functionality two and stepper
241:16 - functionality one so it's 8 pixels this
241:18 - is probably 30. and your eye is confused
241:21 - because your eye is usually looking for
241:23 - consistent spacing it's looking for one
241:26 - type of spacing if it's 8 pixels
241:28 - vertically it wants it to be 8 pixel on
241:31 - the right vertically as well whereas on
241:33 - the left we have a 30 pixel on the right
241:35 - we have an 8 pixel well how do we solve
241:37 - this what apple does is very smart in
241:40 - their design is they add a horizontal
241:42 - line
241:44 - so the moment you add a horizontal line
241:46 - your eye fixes on the lines and it just
241:49 - checks the distance between line and the
241:52 - top here and i'm going to show you
241:57 - so this would be like
242:01 - maybe
242:02 - 268 yeah maybe 2
242:05 - 72
242:07 - and this would be a gray line
242:10 - and both of these elements would be down
242:15 - and so
242:16 - maybe even a bit longer maybe
242:19 - 282 okay tonight so let's check the
242:22 - distance here
242:24 - so
242:26 - yes maybe
242:28 - so that's 327 pixels
242:31 - so that's 20
242:33 - okay
242:35 - so that's maybe
242:37 - 18
242:38 - or
242:39 - 24 24 so let's group these and make this
242:42 - first row so that will actually make you
242:45 - understand better so let's
242:47 - group
242:48 - and this is first row
242:52 - and let's group this
242:56 - let's frame this and this is the second
242:58 - row
243:00 - and now i'm going to show you
243:02 - so now
243:04 - what we can actually
243:06 - discuss is this
243:08 - okay so what's the distance between
243:10 - these two elements gonna be
243:13 - and
243:14 - one thing we can do is we can even use
243:16 - auto layout to actually
243:20 - picking guests let's say
243:23 - one thing we can do is we can actually
243:24 - do auto layout to actually determine the
243:26 - distance now so you are going to see
243:29 - what i'm doing so
243:30 - what's the
243:32 - margins in the left right and
243:34 - other men
243:35 - other parts let's make them 16
243:38 - here
243:39 - 16 here
243:41 - 16 here
243:43 - and 16 here
243:45 - and we want these to be left aligned
243:46 - that's for sure and
243:49 - one thing we can do here is this we can
243:52 - actually pick the distance between each
243:54 - item
243:55 - and what we can pick is let's say 12
243:59 - and
244:01 - what i want to do now is to pick here
244:05 - so it's actually if we pick it 16 if we
244:08 - match it to the outer spacing
244:10 - that might even work better so if we
244:12 - were to do this
244:15 - so now your top spacing and your element
244:18 - spacing matches so that looks much more
244:21 - unified the only thing this has to do is
244:24 - we have that auto layout here too
244:27 - so we can match them
244:30 - so i'm going to add auto layout for this
244:32 - sub children like the roles so that we
244:35 - can actually horizontally center the
244:37 - elements as well instead of being the
244:39 - child being top alan i want them to be
244:41 - middle aligned
244:42 - and now that looks pretty good
244:46 - i'm pretty
244:47 - and takes the horizontal line
244:50 - our eye actually
244:53 - calculates the
244:54 - vertical distance from this line to top
244:56 - from this line to bottom
244:58 - and
245:00 - the only thing we might have is
245:03 - no i think that looks pretty good i
245:04 - think we might be a bit
245:07 - we might have a bit more height here
245:09 - but i think it looks pretty good i think
245:12 - this is a bit more squishy yeah that's
245:13 - 136 pixels maybe we could have gotten
245:17 - everything to be 12 pixels on the left
245:19 - right
245:20 - and other parts but i think this part
245:23 - works
245:24 - so i think we might keep it 144.
245:27 - i think i like it
245:29 - and let's get this to be
245:31 - all right guys this is already getting
245:33 - to be a long video in the next video i'm
245:35 - gonna actually finish this screen the
245:37 - second one and see in the next video
245:39 - alright so let's finish the screen
245:43 - so what else are we lacking
245:45 - i think we are lacking alignment for
245:49 - and we like are lacking spacing
245:52 - so
245:53 - one thing i'm going to do is
245:56 - i am going to actually start with the
245:59 - checkout
246:00 - with 24 pixels which is r and i want to
246:04 - add i can actually do worship four and
246:07 - i'm going to add the layout grid as well
246:10 - to this one so we can actually check
246:12 - with check which items are aligned
246:15 - our margins left and right to be 24
246:17 - pixels and 16 here
246:20 - and
246:22 - so let's begin with our header here
246:25 - and i'm gonna zoom
246:27 - in a bit farther okay
246:30 - that looks
246:31 - pretty good now
246:33 - maybe one more pixel
246:37 - yes 22 does it does the job
246:40 - and i wanna now
246:44 - i want to get i think this element is
246:47 - already aligned at 24 pixels
246:51 - so that's good i want to get the drop
246:54 - down to be aligned as well
246:57 - yes
246:58 - and then what i want to do is
247:02 - it doesn't need to be that down
247:05 - now the distance to be 24 pixel
247:09 - and i want this to be 24 pixel as well
247:14 - yes i want this to be 24 pixel as well
247:18 - one pixel more down and i'm going to
247:21 - hide the layout knob
247:24 - ctrl shift 4 okay
247:26 - so
247:28 - i think that is our first version
247:32 - now
247:33 - one thing we might do is i think in our
247:35 - drop down we haven't added the calendar
247:37 - icon that i have maybe it might make
247:40 - sense to actually edit because it helps
247:42 - so
247:43 - what i'm going to do is i am actually
247:45 - going to our icon set to fetch it
247:48 - and then i will add i will update the r
247:51 - variant later
247:52 - so i'm gonna go to
247:55 - right click
247:57 - plugins
247:58 - and feather icons
248:00 - and i can check calendar here
248:05 - and boom
248:06 - and i'm going to add this to our icon
248:10 - set
248:11 - so it's gonna be picked from left side
248:13 - here all the thing to here
248:16 - all right so now it's in our icon set
248:19 - and i'm going to
248:21 - basically make its color to be dark blue
248:25 - and i am going to change its stroke
248:28 - width to be one pixel
248:31 - and then
248:32 - i am actually gonna make this a
248:34 - component
248:36 - and before i make it a component this is
248:38 - actually a bit big so i can i might want
248:40 - to resize it so i'm gonna go
248:43 - icon resizer
248:45 - that is at most 16 pixel and yes that is
248:49 - better
248:50 - now i'm going to make this a component
248:53 - and i'm going to zoom out
248:56 - and i'm actually going to go to the drop
248:58 - down here
249:01 - okay so
249:02 - we might actually wanna have it here
249:05 - i'm gonna add it to all four variations
249:08 - so i'm gonna go to assets
249:10 - and i'm going to fetch it from here
249:14 - and i'm gonna move this a bit
249:19 - and i'm gonna get it here
249:22 - and one thing you wanna do is you want
249:24 - the emphasis to be less on the icon and
249:26 - more on the text and one way to do that
249:29 - while still keep consistencies while you
249:32 - make the two elements have the same
249:34 - color you can actually decrease the
249:36 - opacity of the
249:38 - let's say the icon in our case so what
249:41 - you can do here is you can make this
249:43 - eight percent and boom that already
249:46 - makes it better
249:48 - so what i'm checking here is
249:51 - what's the left margin there that's four
249:53 - so this should actually be eight eight
249:55 - plus four is twelve
249:57 - and
249:58 - these actually can
250:01 - maybe
250:02 - difference is four pixels here and yes
250:05 - that looks pretty good
250:08 - yes i think i really like the look here
250:10 - so i will just
250:12 - copy
250:13 - and i will
250:15 - move everything basically so this is 36
250:19 - so i'm gonna move this to be
250:23 - 36 as well i'm gonna
250:26 - copy the
250:27 - calendar and paste it here
250:31 - and i'm gonna do the same for the other
250:33 - so 36
250:36 - i'm gonna do here 236
250:40 - and i'm gonna paste it here
250:42 - and i'm gonna paste it for this one as
250:43 - well
250:44 - and that looks perfect okay
250:47 - so let's go
250:48 - and
250:49 - one thing we can do is we can already
250:52 - realize because our variants are
250:54 - components once we make a change to the
250:56 - master element it auto updates itself
250:59 - and it looks perfect
251:01 - so
251:02 - i think this screen is done maybe change
251:06 - this color to dark blue
251:08 - so what we can now do is we can work on
251:10 - the second screen
251:12 - and that is basically us actually
251:14 - picking a value
251:16 - so that is actually picking the number
251:18 - of guests so this would be part two
251:23 - copy
251:24 - and scheduling part one
251:28 - copy
251:29 - and what we can do here is we can
251:32 - actually but the only change we will do
251:34 - between these two screens is make this
251:36 - two
251:38 - and voila
251:39 - we are showing the interaction now
251:42 - and that looks pretty good
251:44 - now at the end of this tutorial we might
251:46 - actually go back to change some of our
251:49 - drop shadows in certain elements to give
251:51 - them more emphasis but right now i want
251:53 - to make things consistent this looks
251:55 - pretty good
251:56 - so let's do the screens
251:58 - third and fourth
252:00 - so these are the screens where we will
252:03 - actually
252:04 - design so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
252:06 - duplicate the schedule part two
252:12 - and i'm gonna duplicate the schedule
252:14 - part
252:16 - no i'm not gonna duplicate this one i'm
252:18 - gonna make this go to part three and all
252:20 - i'm gonna do is probably just add
252:24 - the
252:25 - date picker drop down
252:29 - and that looks pretty good so
252:32 - well
252:33 - one thing we are actually realizing here
252:36 - is this
252:37 - where
252:38 - we are actually going overboard here so
252:44 - so let's actually get this well the
252:48 - coordinates for this one is not correct
252:52 - so it should actually be 10 pixels lower
252:56 - maybe
252:56 - 11. yes so that is the coordinates and
253:00 - this should be also lower
253:04 - around here
253:07 - and
253:09 - this should be roughly 16 so
253:12 - 412
253:14 - because this part of this element so it
253:15 - should not be just 24 pixels
253:18 - maybe even
253:20 - 12
253:21 - would work yes
253:23 - so
253:26 - now
253:26 - now so this is how it looks like and
253:29 - right now it is not packed
253:32 - and
253:33 - one thing you might think of it is is
253:35 - there a problem with it opening over the
253:38 - checkout button i do not think so
253:41 - because our checkout is already disabled
253:43 - so that is pretty okay
253:46 - one thing we might do is we might
253:48 - actually move everything a bit up
253:51 - or we can also let's see how many
253:56 - so it should end around here
253:59 - if you really want to but that is
254:01 - probably not needed
254:03 - so i really like
254:05 - if it overlays i don't think there's a
254:07 - problem with overlaps i don't think
254:09 - there's a problem what i'm trying to
254:11 - think is
254:14 - what would happen once you picked it and
254:17 - you can actually go to checkout and then
254:20 - if you are trying to press the checkout
254:23 - button but you press here and it's all a
254:26 - mess okay so we need to decrease the
254:28 - height of this and we need to decrease
254:30 - our spacing around
254:32 - a bit so
254:35 - one thing we can do is let's go back
254:38 - here
254:39 - and this was 24 pixels as well what is
254:42 - the distance between each element
254:45 - here is 24 so so far we have 24 pixels
254:49 - so let's tank
254:51 - maybe we can get this to be up a bit so
254:54 - this is like 44 this is 66 so we can
254:58 - actually yeah i think that is the
255:00 - mistake so
255:02 - everything here has to go
255:04 - up so
255:07 - one two
255:09 - three yes so now
255:12 - yes so if you trick check here now our
255:14 - back button matches
255:16 - and i'm gonna do the same for this
255:18 - screen
255:21 - i'm gonna hold shift
255:23 - one two
255:24 - one two then i'm gonna so what i'm doing
255:26 - is the moment i hold the shift it
255:27 - actually shifts 10 pixels instead of one
255:30 - and for 22 pixels i have to do that
255:32 - twice then take my hand off and go
255:36 - twice again for 22 pixels
255:39 - and i'm gonna do this for here as well
255:42 - i'm gonna actually not do it i'm gonna
255:44 - copy again
255:47 - and i'm gonna add in my assets
255:51 - here
255:53 - and
255:54 - that should be pretty good
255:57 - yes that is a lot better and these
256:00 - should also be going down
256:03 - so
256:04 - yes so that is a bit better so another
256:08 - place that we can actually change is we
256:11 - can decrease the margins here
256:14 - and decrease the spacing around here
256:17 - so what would happen if we did
256:20 - 12
256:22 - and with this 12 as well
256:26 - that still looks okay
256:29 - and yeah that still looks okay so we can
256:32 - actually get this up
256:36 - one two three four that should be 24 yes
256:39 - okay
256:40 - so you are seeing a lot of copying here
256:43 - because
256:44 - one mistake
256:46 - like we have made is our spacing well i
256:48 - made this our my spacing didn't work so
256:51 - we are trying just a bit of stuff here
256:54 - and i'm gonna delete this again
256:58 - drag this and now it should work
257:00 - probably
257:01 - let's see
257:03 - yes now it works
257:07 - yeah
257:08 - okay
257:11 - yeah and
257:13 - that is okay
257:14 - that looks pretty good to me
257:17 - and then what we can do is we are gonna
257:19 - rename this
257:21 - this is part three copy and we are gonna
257:24 - drag a new version of this oh wait
257:28 - i think
257:29 - so this should be two because we copied
257:32 - stuff we forgot to change these says two
257:35 - because they already made the choice of
257:36 - the adult at the point two
257:39 - in three they are gonna they open the
257:41 - date and then the four which we are
257:44 - gonna create right now they have
257:46 - selected the date
257:48 - so this will be selected
257:52 - the moment they press done then we are
257:53 - okay to go yes and this is the part four
257:57 - all right let's do the fifth screen so
257:59 - i'm gonna
258:00 - drag this one
258:04 - and i'm gonna write this as five copy
258:07 - and the thing the difference once we
258:09 - make a choice in here and we say done
258:12 - while we picked the date the user has
258:14 - picked the date they have not picked
258:18 - the time of the day that they are
258:20 - actually gonna do the activity in so we
258:22 - have to give them the option that they
258:24 - will also have to pick the time
258:26 - so
258:27 - what we can do is we can go back in our
258:29 - screens and
258:31 - basically copy this horizontal filter
258:33 - process
258:35 - which we have
258:37 - and we can actually paste it here
258:41 - and what we will do is we will just
258:43 - change the
258:44 - we will just first we will make
258:46 - everything to be
258:48 - unpicked
258:50 - and what we will do is we will just
258:52 - change the time so
258:54 - it's it will be like
258:56 - zero eight
258:57 - zero zero am
258:59 - and this would be
259:01 - zero nine
259:02 - zero zero am
259:05 - and then we might jump to let's say
259:06 - eleven eleven zero zero am
259:09 - because we are just showing the
259:10 - available times
259:12 - and then this would be
259:14 - thirteen 000 pm
259:19 - and so i'm gonna go to layers
259:22 - and
259:23 - one thing we might do is we might add an
259:25 - auto layout for this one
259:27 - and we might get this to be 12.
259:31 - yeah i think that actually looks better
259:34 - and we probably want to center this
259:36 - right for this one
259:38 - so i'm going to zoom out a bit i'm going
259:40 - to look here
259:43 - and i think i am going to get this to be
259:45 - off
259:47 - nope the other way
259:50 - 5151 that works and this should be 4
259:53 - pixel above
259:55 - for 12 pixels and yes that looks better
259:59 - and then
260:01 - now that part of the screen is done then
260:04 - what we can do is we are gonna design
260:06 - the sixth screen
260:08 - so i'm gonna drag this one
260:14 - which is the last screen for our
260:15 - schedule
260:18 - and then we will have one option picked
260:21 - let's pick this one
260:24 - and then what we will have is this
260:28 - disabled button has to be also active
260:31 - and boom
260:32 - that looks pretty good actually
260:35 - i'm gonna vertically align these and yes
260:38 - those that was our scheduling feature
260:41 - and in the next video we will do the
260:43 - last two variants
260:45 - so that we can actually design design
260:48 - the last screen the review screen for
260:50 - the checkout so we only have one screen
260:53 - left to design
260:55 - and to actually do that screen we need
260:56 - two more variants the first one is what
260:59 - i would like to call medium cards varian
261:02 - which is this one where it is a bit
261:05 - different it's the activity one so only
261:08 - four activities and
261:10 - what it is is that it doesn't have a
261:12 - label for like that we had so i have to
261:15 - like zoom out a bit here
261:17 - maybe
261:18 - maybe pick one here
261:20 - i think around this and zoom in here so
261:23 - if you look at the activities here
261:26 - each of these activities have this label
261:29 - that signals what it is but for the
261:31 - medium cards that we use in the checkout
261:34 - they don't so we will have to create a
261:36 - new variant for this one
261:38 - and the second variant we will do
261:41 - for this screen is the small avatar
261:44 - images here these very small ones unlike
261:47 - our large avatar images
261:49 - which we use for the attendees these
261:52 - won't have a name attached to them
261:54 - like as in writing
262:00 - let's get those going so i'm gonna
262:03 - actually zoom out here
262:06 - and i'm gonna go to our image cards here
262:11 - what i'm gonna do is i am going to
262:14 - create a new frame
262:18 - i'm gonna name it small
262:20 - image
262:21 - maybe medium image card
262:24 - medium image card
262:27 - it's not that small
262:29 - so and i'm going to give this let's say
262:31 - a bit of 156 pixels i'm going to give it
262:34 - a fill
262:36 - and i'm going to give it eight pixels
262:37 - now what i'm going to do is i'm going to
262:39 - actually add the images and i know these
262:41 - medium cards will only be used for the
262:43 - activities like eating hiking or biking
262:47 - it won't be for the cities because you
262:50 - can never check out the city so what i
262:52 - will do is
262:53 - i will actually
262:55 - remove the fill color right click
262:57 - plugins
262:59 - and i am actually gonna go to unsplash
263:02 - and i'm gonna type eating
263:05 - and i'm gonna pick the same activities
263:07 - there and i'm gonna add the same overlay
263:10 - which is 25 percent if i recall let's
263:13 - quickly check
263:16 - and let's quickly check and it is 75 and
263:20 - i will check the
263:21 - height and bit of it actually
263:24 - so i am checking the height and width
263:28 - and its width is 212 to 148 so it's
263:31 - actually bigger than ours so
263:33 - maybe these are the medium ones
263:37 - i misnamed them card
263:40 - and this is going to be a large image
263:42 - card so
263:45 - so this is
263:46 - 2
263:48 - 12
263:49 - to 148 pixels
263:52 - i'm actually going to make this a
263:54 - component by pressing ctrl alt k
263:56 - shortcut
263:57 - and then i'm going to add variance
263:59 - and first i'm going to set the property
264:01 - and the property will be
264:04 - basically activity
264:07 - and the first one is going to be
264:11 - eating
264:13 - and for the second one we are going to
264:15 - change its image
264:18 - we will look for biking here
264:22 - and pick it and let's name it
264:26 - biking
264:28 - and let's add one more
264:32 - and let's actually go for the hiking
264:37 - all right i'm gonna search for hiking
264:46 - and this one is weather yes
264:49 - so those are the same hiking
264:52 - and boom so now that we have it
264:55 - what we can do is that
264:58 - we will actually zoom out and we are
265:00 - gonna go to the avatars so
265:07 - let's zoom out a bit more
265:10 - and i am looking for where my avatar
265:13 - cards are
265:16 - maybe even if it's more and i'm checking
265:18 - trick and checking
265:22 - and
265:27 - [Music]
265:29 - so in the okay there you guys are okay
265:31 - there at the bottom
265:33 - i did not see these
265:35 - okay
265:36 - these are our normal so let me just grab
265:39 - this
265:41 - here and avatar images so if you have a
265:44 - large avatar you want to create a small
265:46 - avatar so to do that i am gonna press f
265:51 - and i'm gonna zoom in here
265:56 - i'm gonna
265:57 - do shift two
266:01 - to zoom in
266:03 - and i am basically going to make this
266:06 - maybe 36 to 36 and i will give it a
266:09 - border radius of 18 pixels to make it a
266:13 - circle
266:14 - and i'm going to give it a bottom line
266:16 - there
266:18 - and for the sake of this discussion
266:22 - i think i will change the background of
266:24 - it i to this so we can see things better
266:28 - okay so what i'm going to now do is that
266:32 - i will actually get images for this one
266:34 - as well so this will be named small
266:37 - avatar and this is maybe even like we
266:40 - can be a bit smaller maybe 32 pixels
266:46 - yeah
266:47 - maybe 32 and i'm gonna actually find an
266:50 - image for this so plugins
266:53 - and i'm going to use the plugin user
266:55 - profile
266:56 - that will let me generate a random one
267:00 - and that is
267:02 - not good let's do another one let's do
267:05 - one that actually looks like a profile
267:07 - shot
267:09 - okay that is doable so what i'm going to
267:11 - do now is i'm going to make this a
267:13 - component ctrl alt k
267:16 - and i'm going to add a variant and our
267:18 - property will be name just like our
267:20 - large avatar
267:22 - and this one let's say is
267:25 - lucy
267:27 - and for this one i am gonna do the same
267:29 - i'm gonna do user profile
267:33 - insert random photo
267:35 - and this one is let's say
267:38 - helen and i'm gonna go plus here
267:43 - and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go
267:45 - random again and i'm gonna do this three
267:46 - to five times right oops wrong plugin my
267:50 - bad
267:51 - i'm gonna right click plugins user
267:54 - profile
267:57 - and let's see
268:00 - and that is
268:02 - let's say jane
268:06 - and then i'm gonna click again
268:10 - and this is the last one
268:14 - let's get a man here
268:18 - and that can be
268:21 - matte
268:22 - okay
268:27 - all right so
268:29 - let's begin designing our last screen to
268:32 - begin i'm gonna press f
268:34 - so i'm gonna press f i'm gonna pick my
268:36 - iphone 13 mini
268:38 - and i'm gonna make write this as
268:42 - review copy
268:44 - and
268:45 - the first thing we are going to do is we
268:47 - are gonna get our variants that we
268:48 - already designed
268:50 - so we are going to begin with the bottom
268:52 - navigation
268:55 - and we know the coordinate is 760
268:58 - and x is zero
269:02 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
269:04 - looking for the status bar so i'm going
269:05 - to move myself to the right
269:07 - i'm going to get the status bar here
269:10 - i'm going to make this 0. i'm going to
269:12 - make the y 0 as well
269:14 - and its colors over the dark blue maybe
269:17 - i should be around here yes
269:20 - then what i'm going to do is i am
269:22 - actually going to get our
269:25 - t
269:26 - for the
269:27 - elements and for the text and i'm going
269:30 - to write checkout
269:33 - i'm going to auto
269:35 - with the element and then what i'm going
269:37 - to do is i'm going to make this bold 34
269:40 - pixels and i'm going to get this dark
269:41 - blue
269:43 - and then i'm going to get my
269:47 - maybe image cards and in here i want the
269:50 - large image card
269:52 - definitely and i want this to begin at
269:54 - 24 for x
269:57 - and then what i will do i will press t
270:00 - again and i probably want this to be
270:02 - biking
270:05 - then i'm going to zoom in a bit and i'm
270:06 - going to press t
270:08 - for the activity name
270:10 - right biking
270:12 - i'm gonna basically move myself back i'm
270:16 - gonna make this out of it
270:18 - and i'm gonna make this sub header
270:21 - so that is pretty good
270:23 - and then what i want to do is i want to
270:25 - get my location icon
270:28 - so i'm looking for my location icon
270:30 - right here
270:34 - yep that's my location icon i'm gonna
270:36 - get text
270:37 - for the place london
270:40 - ontario
270:42 - and i want this to be dark blue as well
270:45 - this one to be dark blue as well
270:49 - and i want this to be body regular
270:52 - and i want this to be autobit yes and
270:57 - definitely regular here
270:59 - and one thing you can realize is it is
271:01 - not enough this has to be a bit smaller
271:03 - so what we can do is maybe we can go
271:07 - maybe span element here
271:09 - that would work better yes that does
271:12 - work better
271:13 - and i'm gonna align those later then i
271:16 - want my
271:17 - small avatar images
271:20 - so for that i am gonna go amateur images
271:24 - and i'm gonna get a small one
271:28 - and what i'm going to do is
271:32 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
271:34 - zoom in with shift 2.
271:39 - 0
271:40 - and i am gonna duplicate this
271:44 - by dragging it
271:46 - and duplicate another one and another
271:47 - one and i'm going to make sure that all
271:50 - of these small avatar ones are
271:53 - centered
271:54 - and now
271:56 - what we want is basically them being on
271:58 - top of each other so the one that is
272:00 - most on top of each other in the
272:02 - logically meaning in the design also
272:05 - usually should be the most on top so
272:07 - that's the goal so this one would be
272:11 - let's say lucy
272:13 - and this one let's say make this helen
272:15 - at
272:16 - helen is definitely
272:19 - so lucy is going to be the first one
272:21 - helen is going to be the second one
272:24 - and
272:25 - let's say jane is the third one
272:30 - and
272:30 - yep jane is the third one and this one
272:34 - can be met
272:37 - okay
272:38 - so this is the most top
272:40 - this is going to be here
272:43 - this one is going to be the third yes
272:46 - so now then what i will do is i will
272:49 - just take all of these
272:51 - holding shifts so they would come 10
272:54 - pixels back
272:56 - maybe around there
272:57 - so let's check the distance between
272:59 - those two elements that's 13 to 13
273:02 - so maybe
273:04 - one more
273:05 - and 12 yes
273:07 - so we are looking for 12 here i'm going
273:10 - shift
273:11 - with my down key here
273:13 - i'm gonna check again yes that is
273:16 - correct
273:19 - again just 10 pixels at a time
273:23 - oh i'm holding
273:24 - i'm holding caps guys you didn't tell me
273:27 - how dare you okay i was making me say
273:30 - you should hold ship not caps
273:32 - okay i'm i was wondering why this is
273:34 - taking too long man so i'm gonna
273:37 - print these as
273:40 - avatars
273:42 - small avatars
273:45 - yes
273:48 - so that is correct and i'm gonna
273:50 - then move to here
273:52 - i want the color of this to be dark blue
273:56 - and i want you guys to be
273:59 - centered here
274:01 - and maybe
274:02 - let's fix the text
274:06 - and maybe move the text to withholding
274:08 - shift a bit to the there
274:11 - and
274:12 - i'm gonna count the distance so that is
274:15 - like five pixels here
274:18 - so maybe six seven
274:22 - so six
274:24 - uh
274:25 - i'm doing x
274:27 - okay
274:28 - so i know five pixel is here one pixel
274:31 - is there that's six we are looking for
274:33 - two here so it will make to eight
274:36 - for our icons i think that's pretty good
274:38 - we are to center it again and we are
274:40 - going to frame these as
274:44 - location
274:46 - that is pretty good
274:48 - and then the initial part is done
274:51 - then we will do the activity details
274:56 - so let's press t
275:00 - your activity
275:02 - details
275:04 - and these are going to be sub headers
275:06 - right so i'm going to my type system
275:10 - subheader and i'm going to delete left
275:12 - alignment and i'm going to do it out of
275:14 - it
275:16 - perfect okay
275:20 - then i know i will get pricing but let's
275:23 - first finish the your activity details
275:25 - and to do this with the right alignment
275:28 - we probably want to have a layout grid
275:31 - with columns and again it's 24 pixels
275:34 - left and right 16 in the
275:37 - distance and that's pretty good
275:40 - so
275:41 - we already understand that we might need
275:43 - to come back a bit but yes
275:47 - then
275:48 - we will add date
275:51 - so i'm gonna just press here
275:53 - this is gonna be date
275:57 - and then guests
276:05 - yes okay so date and guests
276:08 - and all of both of these will not be a
276:11 - sub header now but will actually be
276:12 - bodybutt bold
276:15 - and then we are going to add the
276:18 - small
276:20 - tertiary buttons of edit
276:22 - so let's add those two from our
276:25 - variants
276:27 - let's find our buttons and then get the
276:30 - small buttons here and we definitely
276:32 - want the tertiary option
276:35 - and yes so let's put these guys around
276:39 - here
276:40 - and let's name these edits
276:42 - perfect
276:45 - and let's look at here
276:48 - yes that looks pretty good
276:51 - so what i'm gonna look for now
276:54 - so edit option is there
276:57 - we are missing two body texts
276:59 - so
277:02 - t here
277:03 - is for
277:05 - the date june
277:08 - 22
277:09 - and first i think it's june 22
277:13 - june 22
277:15 - june 18 22.
277:18 - let's check the date that we selected
277:19 - this 18 june 22 okay yes
277:24 - so this is correct and i'm going to make
277:26 - this body regular and i'm going to make
277:28 - this
277:30 - this way yes
277:32 - and then i'm going to go for guests here
277:36 - and that is going to be two adults
277:40 - zero children
277:44 - that's okay yeah
277:47 - so
277:48 - to align things better what i'm gonna do
277:50 - is i'm gonna zoom in a bit
277:54 - yes and i'm on a windows machine so my
277:58 - magic pad is very very
278:01 - like very sensitive so what i'm going to
278:03 - do now is i'm going to make this a line
278:06 - better
278:08 - yes so that's the 24 pixel that looks
278:12 - pretty good
278:14 - and i'm gonna
278:15 - edit this to the end
278:18 - so they would match
278:20 - that's perfect and
278:23 - these colors should be dark blue
278:26 - and everything literally should be dark
278:28 - blue never black
278:32 - so
278:32 - yes
278:35 - okay so then this is gonna go here
278:39 - and
278:41 - what i'm really trying to do here is i'm
278:43 - gonna check the spacing it should
278:46 - probably be 24 up
278:47 - [Music]
278:51 - oh 20 okay that's not bad so maybe 24 24
278:55 - for us
278:57 - so i'm gonna do
278:58 - listen like this should be roughly 14
279:02 - so i'm gonna zoom in i'm looking for 16
279:04 - pixel total
279:06 - so four pixel there seven pixel maybe
279:09 - nine
279:13 - yes so that is the distance and
279:17 - this should be roughly 12 total that's
279:20 - four five yes that is correct that
279:23 - should be the distance and i am actually
279:26 - gonna get this up
279:29 - and the distance between drew 9 guests
279:31 - should be roughly 16 because they
279:34 - actually belong to a different group so
279:36 - the
279:37 - distance between data and activity
279:38 - should be the same as the guests and
279:40 - date which should be 16 so
279:43 - i'm zooming in
279:45 - there's three pixels here
279:48 - that's four seven so that should be
279:50 - roughly nine so
279:53 - two three four
279:56 - yes
279:57 - and it will be a bit to the left
280:00 - there we go and this one is also just a
280:02 - bit maybe not
280:05 - and this one is as well i just wanted to
280:08 - touch there yes
280:11 - and that's pretty good so far okay
280:16 - so now what i want is i want to patch
280:17 - this one as well
280:20 - and i want this to be five based on just
280:23 - like here literally i'm just
280:25 - copying my distances
280:28 - and that looks pretty
280:30 - good let's look at it from here and that
280:32 - looks pretty good
280:34 - now this has to be aligned
280:37 - so i'm checking here where it goes maybe
280:40 - a bit up
280:42 - no
280:46 - and i wanted to see how it's
280:48 - basically how it
280:52 - looks from here i'm gonna turn off the
280:55 - yes i'm gonna turn off there and
280:59 - i'm gonna press shift r to actually have
281:01 - a ruler present to see the middle point
281:05 - and maybe one pixel up
281:09 - so maybe around
281:12 - here yes
281:13 - i think that's the way to go
281:16 - and
281:17 - then what i'm going to do is i am going
281:19 - to duplicate this
281:24 - and i am basically gonna go down a bit
281:29 - and i am gonna have it around here
281:33 - and i'm gonna do my ruler again to check
281:35 - if it's
281:36 - aligned centerwise on the baseline no
281:38 - it's not
281:39 - so maybe
281:40 - one two three four five
281:43 - okay
281:44 - baseline again which is the middle of e
281:46 - and that looks pretty good yes i'm okay
281:49 - with that i'm gonna press shift ctrl
281:52 - shift
281:53 - ctrl 4
281:54 - the right alignment is correct so we can
281:57 - actually frame these now so
281:59 - i like our spacing so i'm going to
282:01 - select every element
282:03 - so i can make them all a gigantic frame
282:05 - ctrl alt g and i'm gonna name this
282:09 - activity details
282:11 - so i can do the spacing of the whole
282:13 - element easier
282:14 - because i want this whole group to be 24
282:17 - pixel
282:19 - here and this one is probably just going
282:22 - to be 24
282:25 - here so that should be like
282:30 - should be four five
282:32 - yep
282:33 - four
282:34 - eight so that should be like 16
282:36 - so
282:38 - maybe
282:39 - one
282:41 - yes
282:44 - roughly here is 24 for it
282:47 - and i am gonna get this to up as well
282:53 - yep
282:54 - and
282:55 - i really don't watch 18 pixels maybe 16
283:00 - horizontally and
283:03 - each of these elements can have 16
283:05 - pixels
283:07 - here
283:09 - so that's 10
283:10 - so maybe one two three four five six
283:15 - and
283:16 - i'm checking for the vertical alignment
283:19 - with my shift r ruler tool
283:23 - and
283:24 - so this should be a bit to the right
283:28 - that's good
283:29 - and this should the smaller beta images
283:32 - should definitely come up
283:34 - and let's see their distance
283:39 - so that's ten so six plus four here
283:42 - that's ten
283:43 - so maybe six down
283:45 - two three four five
283:47 - six
283:48 - and that looks pretty good
283:51 - the only part is it looks too spaced out
283:54 - so
283:55 - maybe it should all be 12 pixels so
283:59 - maybe
284:00 - one two three four
284:02 - and let's do
284:04 - one two three four
284:08 - yeah that actually might look better
284:13 - that looks to my eye better that's
284:15 - roughly
284:17 - 16 pixels yes so let's check
284:21 - 4
284:22 - 7
284:23 - that's 16 maybe even more right
284:27 - three four and i'm gonna do the same
284:29 - maybe this should be 164
284:33 - and that looks better yes that's much
284:35 - less spacing
284:38 - and i'm going to frame these as well so
284:41 - gonna frame these three elements
284:44 - ctrl alt g
284:48 - and activity
284:51 - t
284:52 - basically
284:53 - review
284:56 - and then what i'm going to do is
284:58 - i'm going to do the pricing
285:02 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
285:04 - press t
285:08 - and i am gonna write this as pricing we
285:11 - are almost there
285:13 - it's looking good i'm gonna make this
285:14 - dark blue and you have done this before
285:16 - this is gonna be our sub header so i'm
285:19 - gonna
285:19 - make this go out of it as well and then
285:22 - what i'm going to do is i am just going
285:24 - to copy the contents of this text
285:29 - my bad
285:31 - so i'm going to go here ctrl c
285:37 - i need
285:38 - new text and i'm going to control v
285:42 - and i'm going to make this a normal
285:44 - regular
285:45 - and i'm going to also give this a auto
285:48 - width
285:49 - and make its color to be dark blue there
285:52 - we go and i'm just going to duplicate it
285:54 - for the taxes so
285:56 - i'm going to press alt with shift so
285:59 - that the alignment keeps
286:01 - not getting disturbed and i'm going to
286:04 - write
286:05 - 450
286:06 - for texas
286:08 - so i'm gonna go here and write
286:11 - 450
286:13 - for taxes
286:16 - shift 2 to go back to zoom mode and
286:20 - that's
286:21 - 77 okay so then we will have a total
286:23 - there
286:26 - okay so then what we will have is we
286:28 - will press alt
286:29 - shift
286:31 - and this is going to be our total
286:34 - and this one is actually bold
286:38 - and i'm going to create another text
286:40 - here i'm going to duplicate this
286:44 - and i'm going to write as 77
286:49 - 77 and
286:51 - yep
286:52 - that's already out of it i am gonna
286:54 - shift this to the right edge
286:59 - and i am gonna
287:01 - duplicate this one again
287:04 - holding shift with alt
287:06 - and i'm gonna write
287:09 - 4.5 and i'm gonna
287:12 - get it to the right alignment
287:15 - so what i'm looking for what am i
287:17 - missing is the final total number here
287:20 - then i will have to frame everything and
287:22 - my total is missing total cad so
287:26 - c8d here
287:30 - so i'm holding my shift and i'm
287:32 - pressing down and there we go and that
287:35 - is if my mat is correct 81 50
287:40 - and i'm gonna
287:41 - yeah shift it here
287:44 - and that's pretty good
287:46 - so what i'm going to do now is i'm going
287:48 - to group all these elements
287:53 - i'm going to frame them ctrl g
287:56 - and this is your pricing
288:01 - and one thing i can do is
288:04 - and this could be a cool spacing i'm
288:06 - gonna frame these as well
288:09 - this is the
288:10 - fee
288:12 - and this is going to be
288:17 - taxes
288:21 - and this one will be
288:25 - total
288:28 - what this will let me now do
288:30 - is that
288:32 - now if i ever add an auto layout for the
288:35 - vertical i want this to be
288:38 - left and i want this to be maybe 12
288:40 - pixel
288:42 - or let's go maybe
288:44 - yeah 12 works pretty good actually 12
288:47 - pixel works here and i want this to be
288:49 - bold as well
288:53 - right here yes
288:56 - so that works and i'm gonna get rid of
288:58 - the
289:00 - layout grid now
289:02 - and i'm gonna make the color of this to
289:04 - be white
289:08 - these white as well
289:11 - yes i think we have to go back and
289:13 - recolor these because these are pure
289:15 - white
289:16 - it's a detail i just called let's go
289:18 - here
289:20 - i'm gonna come back just a moment guys
289:24 - okay this is why you should check your
289:26 - colors beforehand
289:30 - okay that should be good
289:34 - so
289:36 - but final thing we need is actually the
289:39 - paved frame
289:41 - with the edit option for the card and we
289:43 - have a pre-selected card
289:45 - and we also need a
289:47 - large button at the below so let's do
289:49 - that first
289:51 - let's get this one it is disabled so
289:54 - it's an active
289:55 - it's primary and it is basically
290:01 - pay
290:02 - yes
290:04 - so make a payment this would be the best
290:07 - one
290:09 - payments
290:13 - and i think
290:15 - this should be primer i don't know why
290:17 - this is disabled actually
290:19 - this should not be disabled at all so
290:21 - let's make this active
290:24 - and that should be
290:26 - 24
290:28 - yes
290:30 - that's better and then we can add the
290:32 - card
290:33 - so i'm gonna press
290:35 - this has to go up a bit
290:39 - yeah
290:40 - maybe even more up here roughly yes
290:44 - 24 pixels and then i'm going to press t
290:48 - for writing
290:50 - pay with
290:52 - so pay vet
290:56 - and this is going to be a sub header
291:01 - and it's gonna be autobit and it's not
291:03 - gonna be black
291:06 - yes
291:07 - everything
291:08 - nothing is black yes
291:11 - okay
291:12 - so then we are going to create our card
291:15 - our card is 327 pixels
291:18 - press r
291:20 - i'm gonna get it turned 327 and 64
291:24 - is probably gonna have at least eight
291:26 - pixels on the side it might have even
291:29 - more
291:31 - but eight pixels blue but it's gonna
291:32 - have our dark blue color
291:35 - and it's gonna have our name the user's
291:37 - name the
291:39 - expiry date the type of card it is
291:42 - and then it will have the last four
291:44 - digits of the card
291:46 - and so for that we are gonna have t
291:52 - jason malta
291:56 - and i think for this one we are okay to
291:58 - do it with
292:00 - regular span element that's okay
292:04 - and then we will need the the expiry
292:08 - date so i'm gonna just drag it here
292:11 - zero seven twenty five i'm gonna make
292:14 - this out of it
292:17 - and then i'm gonna get our visa icon
292:21 - from our assets from our icon set my
292:24 - profile here
292:26 - and let's get this visa icon
292:29 - and let's give it a color of
292:33 - maybe this blue now maybe it's 200
292:37 - 100 might work yes that looks pretty
292:40 - good
292:41 - and then i want these circles so i think
292:44 - they are roughly three or four pixels
292:48 - so i'm just gonna go in and do them so
292:50 - roughly 12 circles
292:53 - for the whole
292:55 - credit card so
292:56 - i'm gonna press all
293:00 - and i'm gonna make this
293:03 - four
293:06 - maybe five is even better yeah i'm okay
293:08 - with five so i'm gonna then drag here
293:12 - and then i can do is i'm gonna
293:15 - hold shift to drag with the same
293:17 - distance
293:18 - and
293:20 - that looks pretty good so
293:23 - i'm gonna now hold these first four
293:29 - i'm gonna hold the
293:30 - choose these first four make them
293:33 - have the white color
293:36 - and then i'm gonna drag this whole group
293:41 - and i'm gonna do it again
293:46 - and
293:47 - not again my bad
293:49 - last one we don't need it
293:51 - and then i think they are not spaced
293:53 - equally yet so what i'm going to do is
293:55 - i'm just going to say
293:56 - distribute vertically that's awesome
294:00 - and then i'm going to have the text
294:03 - last four digits which can be 3406
294:08 - and it really should be a span element
294:10 - because this should be very small
294:14 - and yeah
294:16 - that looks pretty good i'm gonna zoom
294:19 - out a bit
294:22 - yes that looks pretty good to me
294:26 - this has to be at the edge so i'm
294:28 - holding shift when i'm moving it to the
294:32 - right
294:33 - and what i'm going to do now is i'm
294:35 - going to align the
294:37 - this one so
294:41 - i
294:42 - want 12 pixels up and left
294:45 - so
294:46 - i'm zooming in
294:48 - that's one pixel so this should be
294:50 - roughly 11.
294:53 - and it is two pixels so this one should
294:55 - be
294:57 - the
294:58 - y should be roughly
295:00 - here so 10 plus 2 is 12.
295:04 - that looks pretty good now i'm going to
295:06 - align it my bad now i'm going to pick
295:08 - the
295:09 - visa and i'm gonna
295:12 - go to x i'm gonna align it here
295:15 - i want these two elements to be
295:18 - aligned to the right well so
295:20 - maybe one more pixel
295:24 - there we go
295:26 - and i'm gonna check here
295:28 - that's 9 12 yes that works
295:32 - that works
295:35 - and i'm gonna then pick all the ellipses
295:40 - the number
295:42 - and we'll group these
295:44 - control g
295:46 - card number
295:52 - and i'm gonna click on the text here
295:53 - maybe one pixel up to be centered
295:57 - yes there
296:00 - and that's
296:01 - pretty good actually
296:04 - i am pretty pleased let's check the
296:07 - vertical and horizontal spacing here
296:12 - and what i'm going to do is i'm just
296:13 - going to copy the y from here so this is
296:16 - 6 21. so
296:19 - so this is like 621
296:23 - and to look at its left alignment of 12
296:26 - pixels i'm just gonna
296:27 - press alt that's 16. so
296:32 - that's 12. yes that looks pretty good
296:34 - because is no left spacing in the phone
296:37 - so it is correct so we are going to
296:39 - align these as well
296:46 - yes
296:48 - and let's get these guys to the bottom
296:50 - as well
296:52 - so that's nine
296:56 - maybe around here because we are gorging
296:59 - with the text here
297:02 - yes
297:02 - that should be pretty good
297:05 - so i'm taking a look
297:08 - and
297:10 - i'm gonna group all of i'm gonna make a
297:12 - frame out of all of these ctrl g
297:17 - this is credit card and let's see if we
297:20 - can move everything here
297:22 - after the background didn't come in so
297:24 - let's move this here
297:26 - background has to be at the bottom
297:29 - that's good
297:32 - and let's see
297:34 - oh
297:42 - yeah
297:44 - i don't think we took every element
297:46 - there
297:48 - so
297:52 - yeah the card number didn't come in so
297:54 - let's move the card number in this well
297:56 - okay
297:57 - so let's enlarge in but our frame is a
298:00 - bit off and
298:02 - right now my shortcut doesn't work
298:05 - so i'm just going to check the distance
298:07 - here
298:09 - and that can be between these two
298:12 - elements
298:13 - that is 12 we probably
298:16 - wanted to be in total 16
298:19 - that's four that is good that is
298:21 - excellent actually
298:22 - we want here 18 24 that actually works
298:27 - so it actually works i'm pretty happy
298:29 - with it
298:30 - so there you go guys that is your screen
298:33 - at the end and
298:35 - yeah
298:37 - that is the whole tutorial
298:40 - i think it looks pretty good there might
298:42 - be some spacing issues here and here but
298:46 - if you have stuck a lot stuck

Cleaned transcript:

learn how to use figma variants to design a scalable mobile app from amit who is a very experienced ux designer variants can streamline your frontend design process by allowing you to group and organize similar components into a single container hey guys and welcome to a brand new tutorial now in this tutorial what i'm going to share with you is actually how to build a scalable mobile application step by step on figma now this course is actually done in a two separate stages in the first stage what you are going to learn is basically going to be an overview we are going to learn some of the figma's best tools such as how to use frames how to use the auto layout how to use components so that you can build scalable apps on your own but all these three concepts will tie into my favorite components which is variance you will learn how to use figma variants so that you can create scalable applications that are also flexible that have a different variations for your elements so that your designs will not look just like a standard app now what also matters in this course is that i also have added a homework a practice file if you wish that i am actually going to add to the description of this video below so that you can take it and practice the concepts you'll learn to solidify and master it on your own the homework has suggested solutions attached already so don't worry we have everything covered here and then after we gave you the overview and maybe you practiced the homework then you can do the tutorial where we will build a mobile app from scratch it's actually a great long tutorial and i know you will enjoy it and before we go any further if you are new here my name is ahmed and i'm a ui ux designer currently living in canada waterloo and i will be your host today and i will see you on the tutorial but before we begin the tutorial and give you an overview of what you are going to learn what i want to do first is that i want to show you how to use the two figma files i will add to the description to this video below so that you can follow along the tutorial but also get your homework so that you can actually practice what you learned so that you can master the concepts easier now once you go to the description and click one of those links you will have either the tutorial initial screens file or you will have the homework file and doesn't matter which file you are on what i want you to do to actually have the ability to edit these files is you want to click on the drop down here and you want to press duplicate your drafts and let's go to the homework file and let's do that let's say drop down duplicate your drafts and now that is actually saved and i want to press open so now this project is actually copied to my own account and now i actually can edit it if you don't follow this step you won't be able to edit the file because i will not give you an added access for the master file you have to copy it on your own so that you can actually edit it on your own account so once you are here one more thing about the homework file before we go on each homework file actually has an exercise so each homework file has a suggested solution and it and in the main homework frame what you have is that you have your instructions and then you have four different exercises each exercise actually has a solution where if you click on the component here and press ctrl shift h you can view it and then if you press ctrl shift h again you can hide it that is for windows for mac if i'm not wrong it should be command shift h to hide and show and that is how you can compare and contrast your solutions and again if you have any questions whatsoever just comment on this video and i will actually do my best to help you and let's go all right so let's get cracking now what you see right now in my window is the end result of what we are going to design today in this tutorial and what you see is roughly 10 to 12 screens of a activity app that is a mobile app where you get to choose which city you are visiting then you get to pick your activity and you schedule it and then you pay for it at the end so that is going to be the main workflow and the goal for us though isn't just to design this high fidelity mobile app the goal is also to create it and design it with various thing metals and the most important being variants so that it is much more easy to make it scale later and that is what we are going to do today and it's going to be amazing so make sure you stick around till the end of this video and let's get started now if you like this tutorial and you want to get better at ui ux design specifically i have my own personal channel with my name ahmed aferoglu where i post twice a week videos on uiux design on how to get better at figma how to get better at communications how to get better at ui ux design whether that is soft or hard skills so you can actually become a better uix designer you can also go to the free code cam channel for this tutorial where they actually post all kinds of videos from development to security to ui ux design so that if you want to learn holistically all these new technologies free code cam is actually one of the best channels that i know please make sure you subscribe to this channel as well it's been amazing for me to actually learn frontend development and backend development and i'm really glad this channel exists so before we actually began the process of designing the high fidelity mobile app and make sure that we are using variants we have to cover our bases now because i do not know what your base level of skill is on figma whether that is using its tools or features i have to make sure we are going to cover the basics of what we will use so that you will be able to use the variants that will help your app be much more scalable and to do that i have to actually show you how to use frame auto layout component and variance on figma and if you are new to this don't worry i'm just going to show you in a second but also if you want to solidify what you learn if you feel uncomfortable still after this quick tutorial if you want to solidify what you learn in the description of this video there is a homework link that you can go it has suggested solutions already where you can practice what you learned here and that would solidify your knowledge before you actually go on to do this whole design process from beginning to end so let's get started with framing and also before i start if you look at the bottom left corner i have the shortcuts coming in i'm gonna actually move my yep i'm gonna move my picture to the right so on the left side you can actually see here that i have the key caster tool so that you can actually see what i'm pressing when i'm doing certain shortcuts and i would like to apologize in advance the shift key is buggy so it doesn't show make sure you also hear listen to my voice for the shortcut so anytime i actually want to understand how a certain feature of tool works i basically try to use it in the most simplest ui element possible so i do not focus on what i'm designing but how i will use the tool and the simplest ui design element that i know and you guys know is a button so what i will do is now i will design a button with a frame so i will pick the f short key and i'm gonna move my profile again there you go so i'm gonna press on f as my short key here and i'm gonna drag a frame and i'm gonna set this twist to 128 pixels for width and 48 pixels for height and right now it does not have any fill color so if i click on fill here now it does and i'm going to pick a grayish color and now we have something like a background and i'm gonna add to this frame a text so i'm gonna click on the frame press t for the shortcut for text and i'm gonna say login now i'm gonna pick the auto wet so the text doesn't stretch horizontally and now what i want to do is i wanna center it and having a frame basically allows me to group elements that are have to be in the same group visually so for a button that would be your background and that would also be your label text for let's say an input field input text field you might want to frame your label you might want to frame your placeholder and you might want to frame your background all in just one single frame and it also gives you certain powers such as basically making the content very easy to actually align so i can actually center a line horizontally i'm vertically in the right side here and that works right now pretty good now another power that the frames give you on figma is they are a gateway to actually creating more scalable ui designs and the one way to actually make your design much more scalable is to use it with auto layout if you add the auto layout portion to a frame and to do that you have to click on plus and i'm going to do that but i'm just going to copy and paste this so we have an example so on the left side i will have a normal frame and on the right side i will have a frame with an auto layout and boom so what this frame right now has is this auto layout basically lets us dynamically stretch our button no matter what the input that is one of the powers it can give you and i'm gonna show you what i mean so look at the left side the left side is the button again with the no auto layout functionality and i'm just gonna write n n n n nnn and this happens all the time you might have a button with the label login but it might also become submit or download and you might want to use the same design and you don't want to recreate it all the time and for that reason auto layout kicks in very well so if i do and and and n right now you can see this button scales on its own and it so what figma does is it lets you pick the margins the paddings around the element and you can specify here let's say center let's do 24 24 and no matter the text size this button will scale horizontally even if you increase the text size while keeping the right left top button padding the same now is this the only power of the auto layout feature does it only let us design buttons of course not another good way for you to use it is instead of just scaling horizontally also vertically what you can do is you can also use it to add spacing between elements so you can actually use this for more complex stuff for example let's create a new card by pressing f to create our card frame let's fill it with white let's add a drop shadow with effects here and that's a very rough drop shadow but that will do for now and let's add a title and let's get this to be 18 pixels let's fold it out with ctrl b and let's just copy and paste it again here and let's say loram epsom basically let's have our text here let's make this 16 and unbolt it okay so we have a title we have a body and we are inside this frame and one thing you usually do is you really want to make sure that there is a certain spacing around your card but also there's a certain spacing between elements so what you can do is if you add the auto layout to your frame here and instead of horizontal direction which we chose for buttons here you can choose the vertical one and you can also specify the spacing between items meaning what's the space gonna be between our title and body text and let's pick that to be 12 pixels and also we can add the margins of 16 pixel 16 pixel 16 pixel and you want to be around here so what now happened is we have a left margin of 16 top margin of 16 a margin of 16 and right margin of 16 but the spacing between our elements is 12 pixels and this is very useful because what this will lecture is it will make it very easy to make your designs consistent you won't have to check the distance between each element vertically almost ever again if you know how to master the auto layout feature now let's move on to components so you have your frames and you have your auto layouts and let me zoom out a bit with shift zero so what is the value of components and what is it and that's a very good question and to do that i am gonna first create another screen and let's make that a iphone 13 mini and let's what we are going to do is we are going to copy this button again and paste it just below here so you having a frame an auto layout makes it scalable but you still have a problem let's say we decide to use this button i'm gonna control c to copy and ctrl v to paste on this iphone 13 screen which is a very empty screen i know i'm like ah i always forget to place this profile in the right but okay so we have this very boring screen what can we do really what can we do to basically show us the problem that we might have what i will now do is that i want to basically have the second screen of mobile screen and that is also normal you usually will have 30 to 50 and i want this to be actually let's say login as well but during the design i realized that i actually want this to be blue color and let's make this blue oh yep let's make this blue so i designed this color i designed the color of this button again but you can realize even though i copied and pasted from this color this button its color did not change and now picture this let's say you have 50 mobile screens and you realize your color for your button is wrong and you actually wanted blue instead of brown and you have to go now so 50 other screens and change the color each time and that is a hassle and that takes so much time what components do is they actually solve this problem specifically what components do is they let you create a master element and to do that we have to first make this button a component first and the way to do that is control alt k on windows now this is a component and what you can do is i'm going to delete these buttons now what you can do is to actually use a component in the actual app screens you have you go to assets each component shows on the assets panel here and it basically lets you organize your files and this becomes very handy it's a drop down here so it becomes very handy once you have multiple let's say types of components and to fetch it you basically drag the component you picked and it's here and you can also copy and paste like a normal button and it's here and now we realize that we actually want the color of the button to be blue how do we change it we go to the master element click and we basically i'm going to move my profile here a bit and we change its color to blue and then you realize all the other buttons that actually were the children of this master element also change so this makes it very easy for you to make changes yet it has a problem and variants came to rescue for this problem the problem is what if you want to use the blue color and the brown color so in 25 screens of your apps you are using the color blue in 30 of them you are using the color brown how do you make that work in a rigid format of a component where you only have one master element and that's where the variants come into play and what you do is you click on your component and to use variance you have to have a component simple frame won't work and you click on this plus sign for variance now what a variant is basically it's a variation of the same element so we are still designing a button but depending on the properties we have we can actually make it look different and for our case the property will be color because it we are trying to basically change the color from brown to blue so the property of the variants is color now the first button i wanted to be color blue so i'm going to give it the value for the color property blue and the second one i'm going to give it brown and i'm gonna make it go brown here let's go a bit maybe maybe red yeah i like the red better actually let's do red who cares about brown red okay so now we actually have a button with two different variations it can have the color blue it can have the color red and let's just before we go on i'm gonna show you an error type where what would happen if we also name this the same value blue now then pigment gives you a problem because if you have the same values for the two different variations figma doesn't know which one to show it to to you when you are actually fetching it so you want to make sure that each combination of properties and values mapped to a single variant maybe a single variation of that element so this has to be red it can't be the same and what you do to actually get it is you go to the assets panel again and you fetch it just like you fetch a component but now on the right side here you can pick it and if you pick red it's red and let's copy and paste it here and if you pick it blue it's blue look at that and that is the basics of what we are going to use today we are going to use throughout this whole tutorial frames auto layers components and variants and if you are just new to this make sure you go to the homework practice file in the description just like i said in the previous video and that might help you solidify your knowledge but if you feel bold or you're already comfortable with what i just talked about let's actually begin designing and in this video i'm going to show you how to create type system basically we are using throughout this let me actually go to a screen here let me zoom in let me go shift to zoom in yep so throughout this app we are actually using a single font called sf pro text now if you are using if you have a macbook you can use sf pro if you're on windows you can use sf pro text and again i will add in the description how to download this font if you are in windows if you are a mac user it should already be preinstalled when you bought your computer or your laptop so while we are using only one font we are using it for different sizes and one thing you want to do if you are going to create a scalable application is you want to create and determine your type system early on so in order to do that i'm gonna press on frame to create a new frame and i'm gonna name this type system and i'm gonna move my profile again to here i always forget this guys so in here what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna have i'm gonna press on t for this is a text basically i am gonna this is gonna be my mainframe and i'm gonna come back to check which kind of a type can i use but then once we add all the different versions of the type we are going to use i am actually gonna create a half i'm gonna show you how to create a type system on figma so you never have to visit this frame ever again so let's begin what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna copy this and i'm gonna copy this as again and i'm gonna copy this again and you're gonna have basically in this app two different versions we are gonna have 12 pixel 15 pixel 17 pixel and 34 pixel and we will have this for regular and bold that's all the type versions that we are using so i'm gonna have this as my h1 meaning title text this is gonna be my title text and this is gonna be my second header so each one text sorry h2 text my bad so sub header i think subheader would be a better text and this is going to be 17 pixels and 15 pixels is going to be my body text so this is going to be the body text and i'm going to also automate this as well and it then 12 pixel will be my smallest text so span text i'm gonna call the span text and in mobile 12 pixels is usually the smallest you want to go for like icon labelization in ios you can go 10 pixel but i wouldn't recommend going below 12 pixel it's very hard to read so this is the bolded version so you can see each element here is bold so now what i'm gonna do is i am also gonna select all of these and copy and paste to the right side here and these all of these will be the regular version so they will be the regular version oh yeah sorry my bad i was trying to change the type this will be the regular version here boom okay so now that we actually have our types every type we are going to use is here we can actually add them to figma as a type system so to do that i am going to go over each type here right corner style so i can add them as a style and i can click click on this and i'm gonna be here header slash regular uh my bad this one is the bold one right yes this this one is the bold one i have to edit ah ah matt you are making mistakes ah and that happens guys we all make mistakes so this is the bold one and i'm gonna add this to be header regular and i'm gonna add this one as a sub header bold and i'm gonna add the yep another bold and as you guessed it sub header and this one will be body bold and this one will be body regular now if you are asking why am i adding a slash and the reason for that is i have to move my profile here i'm going to move myself here once you use a slash figma understands that you are actually basically nesting certain elements so once i do header slash figma creates a basically a title named header and puts everything inside that i had like a bold regular so this is much more easier to read for our eyes so the body is done next will be the span so i'm gonna do the same here so span as you guessed it slash bold and i'm gonna do the same for this one click on the plus span regular perfect and i'm just gonna give it a check here and now that we have this this is what we can then i'm gonna show you how we can use this a bit so if we were to have a text here let's say i am a text we can actually and let's move this to somewhere else like our iphone screen here and these screens will be deleted shortly but this is just to prove the point of why this is useful i can change its styles here without ever going to copy paste from here this is almost like how we learned how to use variants almost like a variance for type but figma made it very easy for the type system to do to actually have this very neat in the sidebar here it's actually very neat and now that we are done with the type we are going to move to do this how to create the style design system for the color palette all right so let's create our color system so to do this i'm going to go the same thing i'm going to create a frame by actually click tapping the keyboard shortcut f so i'm going to draw this out and i'm going to name this color system and what i'm going to do is basically i am going to what this will have is basically every variation of colors we will have in this app from this blue and you can see that we have different shades of blue right so i'm just going to zoom in here a bit but this is blue this is blue we have white i believe around if you have a good eye you can tell this is also some sort of a blue color it looks black but it is also blue and we have let's say a gray color here and the background of the screens for this app that i designed aren't actually completely white they are like 98 white so that will be added and those are the colors we are gonna add so one thing we don't want to do again is that we are trying to minimize as much as how much copying and pasting we will do for two reasons first of all copying and pasting is very very hard and time consuming especially if your app scales and becomes instead of a 12 screen app which is here into 100 screen app the second is it is error prone you might have copied and pasted the wrong variation of an element you might have copied and pasted wrong color but if you have a system that you can follow step by step you will also make less mistakes and it will save you time so let's go so i'm going to create what i'm going to do here is i'm going to press o to actually draw circles and i'm going to make this like 120 pixels 120 pixels and these are going to hold my colors and i'm gonna copy and paste this around i'm gonna copy and paste it around yep four times now i'm gonna pick all of these i'm gonna copy and paste this complete set of row and that is pretty good okay so now what we i'm going to do is i am going to begin by the color blue and the i'm going to go from 100 to 400 100 signals that it's actually a very light color and for as the number goes up it means that the color is getting darker and darker so for this blue what we will have is i'm gonna pick the colorful tool and to do that the window shortcut is i and i'm gonna do this i'm gonna go to the second color and i think the second one here is 200 is this one this blue inside the stepper so i think that one so clicking on that one is a bit difficult but i think i can do this guys ready i am so happy for that magnifier tool and i think my just bugged out yep that's your 200 and the 300 is the profile color here so the icon color when it's not selected that has to be zoomed out a bit more i think i'm i think i'm just gonna copy the color here the tool is it's very small so i would make a mistake so i'm just going to copy and paste here and the 400 is actually the text color that i use i'm going to copy and paste this as well now basically each row will serve as one type of a color so the blue is gone what else can we have the blue is gone we will have variations of white so two variations of white so i'm gonna move this and i think we will have a gray somewhere so i think we will have one gray so for variations of white let's tank this through first variation is the input one so input color there is so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna click on my element and i want to have the color fill i'm gonna press i and i'm gonna go here press again that's the oh that is just white okay and then i'm gonna press i and then i'm gonna go copy the background and that's the second one so and for the gray we only have the gray here for the disabled buttons and that is your gray i don't think it copied let's see yes now it copied and white is pretty hard to see so what i'm going to do is i'm going to give this frame a whole dark background because we can't see the white colors i i realize that so i'm going to give it a black color here now we can see all the colors and now that we have this what we can do is i'm gonna go through the same process now at this point i could use a plugin to actually generate these styles for me but i'm assuming some of you have never done this kind of work and it's beneficial for you to see me on how to do this step by step so i'm going to take the long route and i'm actually going to do the same as what we did in the when we were trying to systematize the type settings so i'm going to click on this and i'm going to click on this style icon there and i'm going to click on the add and i'm going to write blue and as you guessed it slash and i'm going to say 100 and i'm going to do this for almost all of them and then 200 and this is the part of when you really are happy that you have plugins available to you that will automatically do this for you but it's good to sometimes do it by yourself so we again did the slash so we can actually see them roll by row and this is gonna be your one so this is gonna be the white hundreds right hundred and this is gonna be the y200 and 200 and let's see this is gonna be the gray 100 okay and let's see how it works right now i'm gonna go on to the screen again i'm gonna draw my rectangle on this iphone and i'm gonna see if i can change its styles and boom i'm gonna move my profile here and yeah just like our type system our color system works it's easily scannable it's very easy to skim and i'm pretty happy with it all right so now that we have actually done the color styles now we are going to move to the icons we are going to create the icon set that we will use for this project in the next video all right so let's actually begin fetching our icon set now we are not going to be creating all these icons from scratch so what i did is actually i created a frame called icon set and i wrote down all the icons we need and you can see the tenth one is bolded and there's a reason why it's pulled just wait for a bait give me a minute i will explain now what i want to do now is i am going to actually use a plugin to fetch most of these icons and i'm actually going to use two plugins the first line i'm going to actually use the plugin called feather icons and the second one the last one the store the visa icon i'm gonna use the plugin called iconify now this is very important and i'm gonna show you how to actually install both of these plugins so in the future you can also have a starting icon set that you can use on your own to save you time for your designs and also it's a good practice to learn how to create your work setup where you actually can have the plugins that you need to fasten your work so let's install the plugins to install i want you to go to click on the main menu plugins and i want you to go to bottom here and say bros plugins in community once you see the screen i want you to type feather icons this is the first plugin we will download and i want you to filter with the plugins here and i want you to click on install for this plugin once that is installed i want you to write here iconify and i want you to install this one as well now if both of these are installed now you can actually download these icons and i am not going to go over the process of actually using the plugin what i will do is basically i'm gonna go to the feather icons the first plugin we installed and i'm gonna basically install all these nine icons by fetching it here it's gonna be a bit boring so i'm gonna actually speed things up in the video level so that's why all these texts are there and you can also do this on your time and let's go and for the last icon i'm gonna for the visa i'm gonna go plugins and instead of going through feather icons i'm gonna go for iconify and i'm gonna look for visa and i'm gonna pick this one yeah i'm gonna put this here and you can see all of these icons are actually i'm gonna select all again and i'm gonna basically create a i'm gonna select all it should show me i think figma is backing up because it should show me a spacing option as a shortcut yep there you are and i'm gonna have this as maybe 24 that's better and they're all spaced well right now and one thing i'm making sure is the bounding box that each icon has is 24 to 24. the inside icon size doesn't matter as long as it doesn't go out of bonds but for your styling knees it's very important that each icon has the same width and height of a surrounding box now you will see in the design some of the content meaning the actual vectors might have different sizes than the other icons but that's okay as long as the bounding box is the same we will make it work so now that the icon set is actually created let's move on to the actually creating your first variations for our first login and sign up screens so before we actually move on to the looking at the up and login screens i forgot to do one thing in our icon set so vial and i'm going to zoom with the shift 2 here while you actually might have get got the icons from the plugins we use fedora icons and iconify one thing i forgot was to actually make each icon a component so we would actually be eligible to use them from the asset spat assets panel and the main benefit for that is is you do not want to be coming back to the screen to copy and paste icons all the time that takes a lot of time it's much easier to use the assets panel and just drag and drop so let's do that so i'm going to go to layers and i'm going to go on the left side i am just gonna go through the i'm inside the icon set frame i am with shift i am mass selecting each icon and then what i'm gonna do is i am going to make these a component and let's see ah yeah thingama did not have that shortcut did it so that just created the combo mess so we have to go through the old way i'm just gonna do the ctrl alt k for each of these and that is boring i don't know if this has a shortcut or not i thought it would it didn't and it's crushed my dreams but it happens so let's do that so now each icon is actually a component and we can actually reach them from here and that is very handy so let's move now into the sign up screen login screen let's create our first variant so i want you to take a look at this two screen and i want you to basically ask yourself two questions what elements to visual look alike and of these elements are they also logically alike what do i mean by this so when i am actually looking at the screen what i want to do is i want to systematize patternize almost everything so i do not do unnecessary work because in a production level design like i said previously you are not going to be working with 12 screens we are going to be working with 100 and if it's a web app that is actually responsive it might be 300. so you really want to minimize your work and to do that we are looking to actually create the variance well how do we know which elements belong together by answering those two questions i said which elements do visually look alike and for me right now all these rectangles look alike including the button but then i ask myself which of these elements are logically alike and i can justify saying the input text field is logically alike with the email text input and the password is also because they are all input text they are basically all input fields but a button is a button it has a different logical functionality it is used to actually have an action accomplished it doesn't take an input so we are going to create s variants for the input field and it will have three variants the name the email and the password and that's how we decide things we answer those two questions i'm gonna press on f to create a frame and i really want this to have a different background color because i'm going to use a lot of light colors i wanted to have a dark color like the color palette and let's press on f to create our frame and i think the width of that is 325 what's the margin there 24 26 okay so ahmed made a mistake to pass me it should probably be 327 so it would have 24 pixels left and right on a iphone device so 327 pixels 48 pixels for height and i'm gonna fill this i'm gonna move my profile image here i'm gonna fill this with the our color style which are now here based on our previous video i'm gonna pick the 100 i'm going to add this a border radius because if you look this input all of these inputs have a border radius of 8 so i'm gonna add eight here and i'm gonna give it a drop shadow of four or sixteen and probably ten pixels and you probably cannot tell how the drop shadow works there because the background is what would you say black but if it was white this is how the drop shadow would work and let's go to the previous i wanna under the change boom so our frame is good i'm gonna go back to there our frame is good i'm going to rename this as input and i'm going to rename the parent as inputs so it needs now a text for the placeholder text i'm going to write json mamoa i'm doing the text input field and i'm gonna also because we have the type system i'm gonna go and say this can be a regular auto regular body and that's pretty good and i'm gonna make this out of it and i want to basically align this like 12 pixels maybe yeah that looks pretty good and so aligning text vertically is always hard because even if you use autofit there is always bottom and top spacing so in this one you have a three three and a half pixel on top of the j and four pixel on the bottom so your center when you are centering if those two distances are farther apart you're not actually centering the text because the spacing is correct so this should be maybe a bit low but it shouldn't be complete 15 it should have maybe 14 yeah that's how it goes that's a bit better and the color of it should probably not be black but the gray that's perfect so now now that we have our input frame we have to make it a component so that we can actually have eligibility for the variance functionality so to make a component the shortcut on windows is ctrl alt k and now i have a component and i'm going to make this a variant by clicking on this plus button boom and my second variant will probably be the email one so it would be jason at hotmail maybe x jason hotmail.com you know if we have to make this look production level and now i have two examples two variants of the input field now what should my property name be and to answer this to write this to answer this very simply you should ask yourself what is the attribute that i am actually judging the difference of the variance meaning what separates the variant here what separates an input field from another and in our case it's type if the input type is password it will look a certain way if input type is email it will look a certain way so for this one the type and it will be text for this one it will be email and we should add a third one and this is the most complex one it should be the password one and i'm gonna write this password and it has actually an icon at the end and it doesn't have a it has the eye icon so you can actually hide and show the password so i'm going to delete the text it doesn't have a text what it does have is the hidden password right now so i'm going to press o to create those hidden passwords and maybe eight awesome so those are my that's my circle and i want the circle to be like yeah dark blue and i'm clicking on alt to actually drag to duplicate and then i am gonna do one more time that's good and i'm gonna take a look out to see if this works and i think two works and i'm gonna select all of these to basically copy and paste so let's see that i'm gonna select all of them to basically determine their spacing if i zoom in a bit does things let me nope but i think they are equal space so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna group these circles group selection i'm gonna say password text and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to add i'm going to make sure this is aligned well is it by 12 oh what am i clicking it's 12 so it matches the alignment of the email field and now i am going to add the eye icon i'm going to my assets icon set and i am going to drop the okay i think we didn't i haven't got the eye icon let's see if i didn't yeah oh i'm okay guys i think i skipped it okay so i forgot to make the component so let me go back so now i'm gonna select my frame i'm gonna drop my eye right there go to my layers my eye is there perfect and i want it to be as away as possible as 12 pixels maybe one two and what's it's yeah i think that looks pretty good i think that looks pretty good one thing i want to make sure is this one two pixels i want it to be one pixel i want the circle to be one pixel as well and i want the whole eyes color to be dark blue we don't use black okay and that one works pretty good one looks pretty good i think also so this one is the visible i think we got the wrong eye icon so in this one what we have is that the password is invisible so that's the wrong eye icon so i have to go back now and okay these mistakes happen they will not deter us so we have to install let me quickly install the other eye icon here right there yep let me put it in the icon set let me put it here let me make it a component and let me oh that's too much let me zoom it zoom out and i'm going back to my inputs come on third time is the charm delete that eye icon click on the password input go to assets get the eye that is actually invisible select its color to be dark blue and we want it to have a stroke of one pixel and also we want to let's see if we what's the distance yeah we wanna give it what is it now 15 12 and then we want this to be 12 also and boom yeah now it works all right so now that so how this is gonna be used again is now that we can go to assets and we can have an inputs variant here like you can see and if i were to drop one here i can pick its version if we pick password this test if you pick email it's this so now that the inputs is done now we can i zoomed out too much now we can focus on the sign all right so now that we are done with the inputs let's begin creating the variants for the large buttons which are the sign up login buttons for our signing and login screens but if you look at the other parts of the app as well we can see we are using the same button for booking and we also have a different state of the button which is the same width and height but it's great so it's disabled and one thing one more thing i want to take your attention is the label in each of these meaning label on each of these large buttons is some of them is login sign up book knob go to checkout the bit of the actual element doesn't change but the size of the label is changing so that means we actually have to use auto layout to accomplish this functionality so let's get cracking so to create a frame again you know this now i'm gonna press f and i'm gonna name this as buttons and the reason i'm doing these all in different frames is because as you can see i actually the more type the more i separate each component apart i will have easier access in assets panel because they will be much more organized so in the buttons what i want to do is it also i'm going to create click on f again tap on f again and i'm going to set this with the 327.48 i'm gonna change the color of the buttons frame to match the dark one here and i'm gonna add a fill of white there but my white is actually specified with 100 same as what we went through for the input fields it's gonna have eight pixel of radius and it will also have a drop shadow of four four 16 pixels blur and 10 pixel for the actual drop shadows color up for its opacity so now that we have this as the starting point i am going up and one thing i realized it is different for the button is it's actually the blue color so i'm going to change it to here the initial blue boom it also has a label just like the input field but the label is centered and that's important so it will be like login so the label is centered and it is also bolded so in here in the input field the labels were left aligned but also regular but for the buttons it is centered with bolded so they are also bold not regular so i'm gonna pick my text of basically bold 15 which is pretty good and to actually accomplish the centering i am actually going to use auto layout and one thing i want to do is i don't want it to hug content i want it to fixed width and height and there's a reason for this so fixed center fixed center the reason is so i'm gonna show you two ways of this okay so i'm gonna actually drag another one so so let's say how contact hunt content so in this situation if i were to actually add new text you can see the the content of the background also scales but that is not what we have throughout the application because despite the changes of the label size horizontally width and height of the background of the button stays the same buttons width and height stay the same and that means it has a fixed return height but the text is free to grow as slight as it can so that's why we are using fixed instead of hug so now that we are here i i can show you now i can make this grow and the the what would you say rectangle itself will not resize and that is the key here so now i have this what i will actually do is that i am gonna make this a component so that i can make then i have a variant so i'm gonna click on ctrl alt k to make it a component and i'm gonna name it large button and i am going to give it a variant and what should the variant be based off is again the same question and again what attribute are we trying to differentiate we know the key attribute we have right now is that if the button is primary it's going to have the blue background color and if it's a secondary or would you say if the button is active it will have a blue color if it's not active it will have a gray color meaning it will be disabled you won't be able to tap it but we can also have another property here that is important such as we can have and in this application for large buttons like this we don't have it but we can also have a secondary button or a tertiary button meaning that what would happen if we were to show a button here like this look at the cancel button here for the small buttons unlike the primary button here where the button is filled and it gets your attention a secondary button is created with the fill removed but only added in the strokes so i think i will have that in the large button just in case in the future we might need it so i'm gonna have two properties the first property and again is active is it active or not and to add the second property i'm clicking on the more options icon i click on add new property and then the moment a bit of buggy here and the second property will be priority and i'm gonna zoom in so what i'm going to now do is i'm going to the first button and i'm going to say active yes priority primary the second button is also going to be primary but it won't be active and when it's not active we want its background color to be grayed and we want the color of here to be blue and i don't want this to have a complete white that's my mistake we have to use our color system wherever we can and so now we have two primary buttons one is active one is not active and i want a third one just in case that's too much zooming in i want a third one just in case here gonna zoom out third one to be secondary button but active so what that means is it is active but it is secondary and finger is giving me an error because it cannot have the same values as the first one so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna click on shift x to switch stroke and fill properties and i am also going to give this the color blue there we go and that looks pretty good so those are our three versions of our colors and yeah so those are our buttons that we can now play with right just before we go on board looking at sign up screen began designing them i haven't mentioned here so in the previous video we did the button variations and one thing that your test of adding new text here might fail so here right now it is not centering the text even though we set it as fixed width and height because you actually have to click here to actually select where do you want the position of the content p and if you select center no matter what you add should actually be recentered alone and that is how it works and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to do this for each of the variants i'm going to check if it's done here it's done if that here it's not done so i'm going to do that here all right so now all of them is done now we can actually move to the login and sign up screens all right so let's go so and this is my tea that tastes great okay so i i know you've been waiting for this part so let's begin so i wanted to show for our frame we actually have iphone 13 mini and when i'm going to do what i'm going to do is i'm going to just press f and i'm going to pick iphone 13 mini as well and i'm going to pick it around here and i want you to take a look at how to go on and design this so when i'm looking at this what i'm seeing is a basically a background image with some kind of an overlay on it we have the company logo we have the message if it's a signup it's welcome if it's a login space if i'll come back and we have some form to fill and at the end of the form we have the option for the user if they have an account already they can go to login if they don't they can come back it's a very simplistic sign in signup that doesn't have social media account signing options etc so let's go so one thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna need the sign ups sign up screen copy and what i'm gonna do is i am gonna right click and i'm gonna go for the my plugin called on splash to actually find the background image and if you haven't already please install the plugin on splash here and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna look for travel and let's see what we have let's see i'm looking for this particular image but i might not be able to find it but oh i did i'm lucky so i actually got the image um you know sign up screen and i think i did a mistake here where i think the image is added to the whole frame that's not what i want i want the image to be i want the image to be on top of a rectangle here i think that's what is happening so i think i have to get this overlay here yep i got this rectangle and this rectangle is what i'm going to fill the image as so plugins unsplash the same process maybe travel here go down go down go down here why is it okay now that is correct so sign up screen copy okay so this is correct now i'm going to add an overlay to the image and i'm probably going to add the overlay of blue meaning even in the overlay i'm going to use our primary colors and i am going to go back here get rid of that one i'm gonna add an overlay and i want the overlay to be basically our blue color which is basically i can do i'm gonna press i for its color and i'm gonna pick that and probably 20 px 20 that's too little maybe 50 that's too much 40 that's too blue so my blue guess was wrong maybe maybe it needs to be a darker color so maybe what we need to do is actually we might need to go and pick our dark blue color here and copy that remove that from our frame go to our image go to its overlay and paste it there that's how is eight i'm trying to find the maximum okay that's so i know eight is too high i know 20 is too low maybe 30 no 50. and what you can do is you can play with as you are holding shift you can go by 10 and probably around 55 or 45 is the answer i will go with 45 for now and that's how you find the background overlay color and you basically find the up maximum and minimum bounce and just play around till your eye actually finds that okay this is the value that makes sense so now i am looking at i'm going to design the logo and i'm going to have a rectangle here and i am going to make this maybe 128 pixels and what i want is to have it for it to have the initial blue color we have and one thing that is different for this one is that if you look at it it's a rectangle but only two of its corners are actually having a radius so that's exactly what i'm gonna do for this one and it's probably height is 40 pixels as well yeah maybe 60 but let's first add these edges let's write 16. do i edit to the right edge i think so yeah so maybe 64. yeah that works and 148 and to see if my height matches now and i could go the easy way here i think for i think 48 would work maybe 64. i'm not sure let me check i think this has to be bigger a so for me to actually know i can just go and copy the values but i want to train my eye even though i designed the whole app previously by myself this is not a community project app what i will do is it's still difficult to redesign something what i will do is i will click on shift r which lets me access the ruler tool and i'm dragging a vertical straight line here okay so for the width i got it right so it is 188 pixels and his height looks all right now but i think the radius is for this one a lot more so maybe 32 and 32 that is correct i think that works and then i will add a text here and it will be activista and i want it to be autobit and i think this is the only text because it serves as a logo that we will not systematize with our type and what i want this to be is basically 36 pixels maybe 20 pixels and i want the second part of it to not be bold so i will have the second part selected i'm going to make it a regular and that works pretty good and now i'm going to align this let's see and i'm gonna check how far away it is and i think i want it to be 24 and at 24 that is 42 so at 24 i want the right part to be also 24 so it's centered so i'm gonna get this to be maybe around here so maybe this can be 172. and and yeah i think that works pretty good maybe 17 and again aligning vertically is difficult because you can see top is six pixels but the bottom is eight so you you cannot trust the figma tool here should probably be 16 to 15 and that should work okay so let's move on and we can circle back to the logo again later so now what i'm gonna do is i am gonna have my text welcome and this will basically be my header so i'm gonna tweet it as a header and i'm gonna automate it and i'm gonna add the exclamation point there and then what i'm gonna do is i am basically going to think about all this big form assay frame and inside this frame i will have three groups name group email group password group and then button four groups maybe and the input groups will have a text label like your name and then the input and only the button will not have a text label above it so it's going to be like this so i'm going to go to my assets and i am going to go and fetch an input here all right and before going further i want to add a layout grid here so i can see things better and if you don't know what a layout grid is it basically allows you to 4 16 it basically allows you to use vertical and if you want vertical horizontal layout of how your content should be placed at all screens it works very well so i'm gonna do that so i can no okay that's at 24 pixels go above and this is the name field so what i need now is the text label i'm gonna uh undo i'm gonna do zero gonna go here text i'm gonna say your name and this probably should not be but irregular but body bold so your name probably two dots here and i will have this auto bit as well and i'm gonna check how far away it is from the text input it's 22 pixels that's a lot so our left margin is 24 pixels so the spacing i'm going to do here is also important and how i'm going to base it is basically i know our left and right margins will be 24 pixels so i'm going to use the power of two for each margin we will have between different elements and when an element is actually related to a group of element meaning when you are thinking of a text input you cannot think of it without the label of your name so they actually should be closer to each other than they are closer to welcome so what i'm going to do is i am actually going to reduce this distance to 12 and that should give me now 12. yep that's pretty good and i'm going to go to layers and i'm going to basically frame these two things and i'm going to write this as text input and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna copy this one and i'm gonna pick this one to be email and i'm gonna change this to your email very simple and i'm gonna do it the same manner where i'm gonna write this as email input and then i'm gonna drag this again and this will be as you guessed at probably your password and i'm gonna go here to my component and pick its variant to be password all right so now what i'm going to do is i am going to add my button which is our button is missing right now so i'm going to go to our assets i'm going to the button section i'm going to drag it here and i'm gonna go and make it go 24 and it should probably be 327 what's happening and that distance is too much maybe around 30 and we can worry about the margins later but right now what i want to do is i want to group all these four things and that would let me use our auto layout function and how i'm i'm going to show you in a second how we are going to use it so i'm going to frame these four elements as well and i'm going to write them as the form sign up form and then i'm gonna add an auto layout and what auto layout does is it's gonna give me between each element so our name frame email frame password frame and our button i want us to have roughly 24 pixels and that's great and i'm gonna basically i really want to hide this yeah i don't want to see the red colors anymore i want to hide our layout so i'm going to click on alt shift 4 to actually hide it that's good and now let's see how far away our welcome text to our form that's 43 pixels so i'm gonna get it to be maybe 24 and let's see how far i made that is 32 i think 32 pixel there works well so from the logo to top that's 32 pixels from here that's 24 pixels and i'm gonna check with my ruler how everything is aligned to the left that is pretty good yeah i think this works so this is your sign up screen guys and the only thing missing right now is this text at the bottom and this should be my bad and this should also be sign up and let's add our text our basically gateway to the login screen that says tab here if you already have an account and i want this text to be autofit and i don't want it to be bold i want it's partially to be bold but and i wanted to start at the same left alignment which is 24 pixel for the x coordinates and i wanted to have because it's so related to the sign up button i want it to be like 12 pixels up most so maybe 12 pixel that's pretty good and then i'm gonna make the tab here but uh tap here mode to be bolded and i want it to be again bolded and it's color to be blue and that works pretty good i like what i'm seeing i like what i'm seeing compared to there now what i want to do is i'm going to design the login screen and we are missing the status bar for these two screens so it doesn't matter but later on the status bar will kick in and let's go and design the login screen so what i'm going to do is i am going to basically drag a copy of the sign up screen and i'm going to rename it as login screen copy and the first i'm going to look at the differences the first difference is the welcome back message which is makes sense and then you can see the alignments here of what is the same but how where the text began is the same so what we will do is to keep the same alignment i'm going to just remove your name field here and then it goes up and i'm going to add the welcome back we probably want it to be uppercase i i like it uppercase more now and i'm just gonna drag this but if i press shift you can also go 10 pixel up instead of normal one and i'm gonna check the distance that's 12 perfect and the text also has to change it should be if you don't don't don't already i have an account and that works yeah i'm looking at the login screen now and that looks pretty good i don't think it has any issues i think i can ship this one yeah let's move on to the next screen i think the signup and login process is done and let's move to the next things we have to do and i think we have to do a bit more variance before we can all right so let's think about the discover screen and let's find out what we have to design before we move on to the screen what are the elements we have to add as variants so that we can actually make it easy for ourselves when we go to part two and we will copy and paste so that you know we cut our workload again so the a couple of things that we don't have right now is we do not have this top status bar that i believe is present in every other screen and it looks like it has two modes in the first mode it's in the dark blue color you know of our color palette and the second part when it's behind an image is actually white and then i look further and i realize we have a new input type and i think it's the search bar input and that's a new input type and then we have a new element filter elements here one moment filter elements here and it looks like each filter element has two states one is when they are unpicked and one is when they are picked so in the london case here we have a filter element that is picked and then we have a filter element that is unpicked and then we have some cards and it looks like we have a few different options for them we have cities one moment we have cities we have activities and it looks like each city has a three different image and each active is a three different image so i can see just the cycling right biking biking biking they are just changing its position okay so then let's begin by actually finishing the status bar so i'm gonna create a variant for the status bar first so i am gonna do the same process gonna press f and i'm gonna name this frame status bar and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna to pick its color i'm gonna tap i and then i copied the color from the inputs and now what i'm gonna do is i am gonna copy this element and i'm gonna paste it and the reason i copied this element is the designing from myself is i it was an element i actually fetched from an ios kit so usually you have to download the apple's resources to actually get the top status bar their design is very intricate it's much better to fetch them yourself and then change their colors for yourself then it just designed from scratch and i am gonna get this one's color to be blue uh for this one maybe we might need to go for white background and this will be a bit difficult because we have a dark color here and maybe a bit of a lighter color because we will also have a white variation then because the background is white we won't be able to see the white variation so let's pick a background maybe somewhere in the bluish here yeah that might work and so right now i'm gonna detach it it was a component before i'm gonna make it this bar like status bar element i'm gonna make the copy for our sake so i'm gonna now make it a component and uh to do that i am gonna press the shortcut ctrl alt k for windows and then i'm gonna add a variant to it and i know now that we know that the the only difference will be its color so what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna basically say uh the the properties value the property will be color and we will just pick its color so for color this is dark blue and for this one we will pick white and let's just do that let's just make this white and boom and that works pretty good so that's your status bar all right so for the filter element i'm gonna do the same thing i'm gonna create my frame with the shortcut f and let's put my frame here and i'm gonna name this frame filter filters and then what i'm going to do is basically i am going to create a frame let's say maybe 32 and i'm gonna basically let it have a stroke and i'm gonna give this a 16 pixels for border radius and i want border radius or i want its border color to be blue and then what i want to do is i want to add a text here for its label and let's say london and i want this to be a basically a regular text so i want this to be regular body so let's go to our regular body and let's make this auto wet and i want also this to be have a auto layout so that things always stay at center so i wanted to have an auto layout and i don't want it to hug its content i want it to be maybe i i do want us to hug its content for the wit for its height i'm okay with fixed center so let's think and i want the color of the text to be also the blue and let's see how it works now yep so when so it can it horizontally moves it horizontally increases its bit dynamically but for the height we have a fixed height so that's the i think that looks pretty good to me i'm gonna just check i think this has to be at the center yeah i think maybe eight pixel 8 pixel and e24 yeah i think that looks pretty good i think i like that much much more so now that i actually created a design that i like i want it to actually be a component so i can actually make this element a variant so to give it the superpower of a variant i'm gonna go through the same process of doing the shortcut ctrl alt k to make it a component first and i'm going to rename this filter and then i'm going to add a variant to it and the variant property we are going to use is basically uh picked meaning is the filter element picked or not because that's the only change that's the only attribute that determines the change if the filter element is not picked so this is a no it will look like this if it is picked so we have to swap the fill value so i press shift x and i'm gonna get the blue here and i'm gonna make it white and i think i might also make this bold this time yeah so that looks different and this one has to be yes and yeah that is the filters and now they should also show up so now both of our filters and inputs and status bar show up in the assets which is great for us to actually actually use them on the left side instead of going to their original place now let's move on to let's move on to what else do we need bottom navigation and let's get that going and in this design the button navigation we don't have the other screens for the user profile or settings but in the future if we had wanted to grow the application we will definitely need them and for that reason it's probably a good idea to have a three variants for the bottom navigation to have basically selected different icons all right so let's move on forward with the button navigation and i'm going to create the frame with the f shortcut this should be very familiar together guys now we have done this like 10 times i'm going to name this button navigation and i'm going to take a look at the button navigation and okay so it takes the full width of the screen and i think it's between 48 to 60 pixels and it has three icons inside so what i'm going to do is i'm going to go here and i'm going to press f to create the base and it's going to have 375 pixels for width as that is the vet for the iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna have it a fill color and i'm gonna have it the color blue and now i think it's left top and right top sides have a border radius so i'm gonna definitely do that of maybe 12 so i'm gonna do eight oh 12 no 16 and here 16 nope that wasn't the right one uh 16 no the middle one yes i always forget which one is which maybe not even 16 is enough 32 maybe no i think 16 is the right one eh let's look at back yeah i think 16 is the right one so after this what i'm going to do is and is the 48 right i think it's a bit bigger than 48 i know this this button is 48 and i'm gonna catch with my eye now i think it's i think it's between 48 to 60 probably let's say 54. maybe 56 that's the 56. when in doubt go multiples of four and i don't remember what i designed it to be but it should be somewhere around 56 54 52 maybe but so then what i'm going to do is i'm going to add the icons and to do that i am going to go to our assets and then what i'm going to do is i am actually going to click on the icon set and i'm going to have the compass and i'm done going to have the user profile and then i'm going to have for the third one settings now now that i actually got the content here there is some stuff to do so what i want to do is basically have the left margin of this bottom navigation and the right margin of the bottom navigation to be 24 pixels my mistake that's just a very large zoom out basically if you guys remember how do we show this so i'll shoot four so if you remember our left and right margins is 24 pixels mostly so let's get this to be here so it should be 24 pixels for the left and right and we can show this by in our buttons here actually that's the wrong margin but left is 24 right is 24 and we want to keep that for our bottom navigation as well but we also want these elements between each icon to have equal spacing and to do that we have to actually use auto layout so what i'm going to do is i am going to pick these three icons actually i'm going to pick the frame and i'm going to add an auto layout to it and it's going to basically have the horizontal that is correct if we go vertical it's going to be look like this we want horizontal and we want each content to be centered and then what we want is basically we want this to be maybe we'll just say the left margin to be 24 the right margin to be 24 and it is 46 pixels right now i think we can increase the this to maybe 16 and this to be 16 as well and that's pretty good and maybe 15 14 14 might look better yeah and 14 and then what we can do is now the left and right margin my mistake now the left and right margin is 24 pixels and distance is equal that looks pretty good now what we have to do is make this icon compass selected and that would be the white and i don't want the black color for either of these icons so i would actually make them go dark blue and that's our bottom navigation now that's just write bottom nav and actually to create the variations of this we have to make this a component again ctrl alt k and then i'm going to add two variations for this two more so maybe one more here okay and we should ask ourselves again well what will the property be and property will be the chosen icon so i will write chosen so in the first one the chosen is pretty simple it is the discover in the second one chosen will be profile and the third one it will be settings now the reason i don't write chosen screen is prop like it would just be three dots and it may be it's too large of a text for it to show so chosen still makes sense and now i'm going to adjust the second button navigation element because in this one what's chosen is the user profile and in this one it will be the settings so and yeah i think that works i think the only stuff that we have to change is i think each of these are now two pixels and i really don't want our icons to have two pixels so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go back to the icon set and i'm gonna make these have one pixel width now that we are done with the bottom navigation we can actually go and move on for the image cards all right so let's move on creating the variants for these small image card so if you look at the discover screen here we have kind of two different types of image cards the first one is basically an image that actually showing you the cities like berlin prague amsterdam and in the other cars you actually see the activities so the discovery part one you are picking the city with the cards and discover part two you are picking the activity you are gonna do in that city so that's already two types of variants we can we pick the variant based on its type of whether it's a city or whether it's an activity and that is the way we are going to do but what is also important is if a variant is a city it looks like it has three different types of cities it can be prague it can be berlin and it can be amsterdam and the image looks different depending on what kind of a city it is the same goes for an activity the activity can be eating the activity can be hiking the activity also can be biking so depending not only the type of the cart which is city or activity we also have specific items that we have to account for what's which city is it which activity is it so that's what we are gonna do so let's begin creating the variation now you must be very familiar with this move i'm gonna press f for a frame shortcut and i'm gonna draw this and i'm gonna say image cards and what i'm going to do now is once i named my frame i'm gonna i'm gonna tap the f keyboard keystroke again to draw my card and i'm gonna give this like 156 108 and i'm gonna fill this first with like white background but our white and the background of this whole frame i'm gonna darken it because it's very hard to see right now so i'm gonna press i on windows boom all right so i'm going to add a border radius of 8 pixels and let's see if i missed anything i think there is a bit wider i'm just going to get the sizing from here for this element that is 150 608 oh i got it right huh my eye was correct i'm glad okay so then what i'm gonna do is i'm actually gonna put in the i'm gonna go click it on my right click and i'm gonna use the plugin called on splash so if you haven't installed this plugin you can just go to your home screen and then you can go here in your community again or you can also do menu plugins and then you say browse plugins in community and search for unsplash now this is a very useful plugin as it lets you import images without leaving figma it's a very good idea to have it installed because as designers we have to actually use these kinds of images all the time and you really do not wanna leave your work setting because it actually disrupts your workflow so you can click on this i also it's installed already for me so you will install this and then you come back and you press right click to use it plugins you find it and you click on on splash and then what we can do is we can look for city and then you can pick basically whatever you want i think we had berlin so we can pick berlin here and that looks pretty good what we can also do is we can just zoom out and see what else is there so i am realizing that a card is not just an image but it is also an image with a text on top of it now for us to have that white text i believe we need to add some sort of an overlay to certain images because if the image is too let's say white saturated too light the white font will not be visible so let's see so i'm going to press t for text and i'm going to write berlin and that is a bit difficult to see so what i want is i really want this part of the thing and i want this to be actually so the problem we are having right now is if i add a draw if i because the image is added to the frame if i add an overlay to it will it work actually that looks pretty okay yeah no it does work huh i thought it would also overlay the font but it did not i can still see the font clearly this might be a bug but hey it works so now that it works i am just gonna undo the change and i'm gonna go to where i am i want to be at 12 by 12 probably so 12 by 12 that looks pretty good and i want my font to be here uh basically body font but bold that first and i wanted to have auto bits and i want to check my surroundings and again it's the auto aligning for the aligning for vertical space is a bit harder so you can see the font actually has a one pixel on its left so this actually is 13 pixels in total so i'm gonna move 11 and i'm going to look down and i'm gonna have to move it up two pixels because it has a four pixels bottom oh my bad sorry yes so this and this is actually the 12 pixel look okay now that i actually got my card what i'm going to do is i'm gonna to give it the superpower of variance i have to make the component first i'm going to press my shortcut ctrl alt k to make it a component and i'm going to rename this as image card maybe a large image card image card and i am gonna click on the variance plus button there and boom so ahmet how many variants will we have for this and that is a good question so we already know we will have two different types this is a city or an activity and for each city or an activity we will have three different looks so three plus three is six so that's how much we are gonna have and then i'm also gonna go here and i'm gonna go to this variant i'm gonna remove its image it's overlay and probably it's filled and i am gonna go right click plugins on splash and i'm gonna fetch here prog and if you haven't been to prague you are missing out it's one of my favorite cities i'm just giving it prague is a fantastic city so we have berlin prague what was the third city uh my memory fails me come on come on i'm at the amsterdam okay i've never been to amsterdam i mean i've been to the airport airport is nice i don't know the city but let's go here let's delete this and let's right click plugins unsplash and let's pick amsterdam let's see probably this one i think it's that one i might be wrong but yeah it's that one okay our images look intact that's good so the city picks are done now i am now going to add the activities and i'm gonna add till six here oops my bad all right so i have now my six cards now here okay so the fourth one will be the first activity and let's delete the image delete the overlay and let's make this basically the activity of eating because that's my favorite thing to do i mean what are what else are you gonna do you are gonna walk the city and you are gonna probably eat but there are some people among us who probably like hiking as well well to each to its own so i'm gonna just remove the white as well i'm gonna do plugins and we are gonna pick where is the unsplash here i'm gonna pick hiking all right and that's pretty good and for the last one we are gonna pick biking but to do that we have to remove the image and right click this is getting pretty repetitive right now and i am going to ride biking and i am looking for this dude right here yes all right so let's fix with our fonts first so this is berlin this is prague and this is amsterdam and so if you notice now while we can read berlin pretty easily it's very hard to read prague and one thing we really want to do is we want all of these images to have the same overlay because if this design actually went to production if a frontend developer were to take this project they would probably tell you yeah i will not go through each image and put a different kind of an overlay this has to be general and so you don't want to give them too much work so what you want to do is you want to find your worst case scenario meaning the image that is lightest i believe for cities is amsterdam and for the active it's the berlin one sorry it's the fourth activity it's the biking one and we are gonna try to give these guys to overlay first so that's what i'm gonna do 20 maybe 25 i think 25 will work i think 25 will do the job let's look at amsterdam our second worst case scenario all right yeah 25 works so that's what i'm gonna do five pixel 25 25 overlay for eating as well 25 and that is pretty good so now i'm gonna actually rename these berlin prague amsterdam this is eating this is hiking and this is biking all right so now that we are actually done with the content of the variant what we want to do is we actually want to specify our properties now our properties were twofold meaning the type of the card is a city card or an activity card and the second is its name is it berlin prague amsterdam these are all the names so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to make my property the first property to be type and i'm going to go to the more option here add a new property and i'm going to specify this as name and i'm going to go to my first one and i'm going to specify type to be city because it's a city and the city's name is berlin i'm going to go the second one city name prague and figma will give you sometimes errors if you ever make a mistake so it's now saying it doesn't have it has an invalid name which is what we want to avoid so we gotta give it amsterdam and you wanna now i'm on to the activities so this one won't be city but an activity and it will be the activity of eating oh i'm getting hungry but let's plug along this is hiking and this one is going to be activity biking and i'm going to do a quick overview activity hiking that's correct always double check your work city amsterdam city prague see the world that actually looks pretty good and though that is your variance and just for the final check you can go to your assets and now you can actually see let's open this a bit you can see the image cards right here as an asset that's fantastic all right guys so this part of the tutorial is done oh now we are going to update our input fields to add the search field as well and let's begin by analyzing how it looks like on the discover screen so what i'm going to do is i'm going to click my screen i'm going to press shift 0 to zoom 100 percent and off the bat what i'm realizing is this if i'm comparing this with the login input field such as the email and password i realize that the height of the element and the width of the total element is the same as 48 pixels 48 pixels 327 327 pixels now search field also has a placeholder just like the email and the name fields here and the difference it has is it has a button that is right aligned inside at the search button and that's the one difference that it has and it also can have the actual value in our design such as when a user actually does an input or picks a filter element the placeholder is replaced by the actual text label what does this mean so right now in our input variants we only have the placeholder version for the my bad sorry guys we only have the placeholder version right for the name or the email we do not have an actual value version where how the user would see this input field if they had already put in a value so that's also something we are going to add and we are going to add this to almost every element except password because in terms of user experience standpoint it is not a good idea to add a placeholder to the past password field because it is not that recognizable you probably want to put it just a line to your label like probably around around here if we were to put it to say 6 or 12 characters like give some constraints on how the password should actually contain but it's not a good idea for consistency to just do a bad user experience so we are not going to have the password field have a placeholder but let's begin by adding our search field and i am going to make this basically search city or activity and what i'm going to then do is i'm going to press r for shortcut i'm going to do this drag it it's 40 pixels height probably and 64 pixels width and i'm going to give it the standard 8 pixel border radius that we have and i'm gonna change its color to our blue and that already looks good i'm gonna make it go align for shift and maybe not that much but i'm gonna zoom in to see how am i doing four four maybe four four four that looks pretty good and then i'm gonna click on this element and what i'm going to do is i'm gonna right click go to plugins because i want to add my search wait why am i doing that i already have in my assets field my icon set so i can just drop this bad boy in i can bring the search here boom and that looks pretty good i'm gonna give it the color of white and i'm gonna center these two okay that's pretty good and i might even group these things and i don't need them to be framed like search button and that's pretty good and then i'm going to look and zoom out a bit that looks pretty good so what's this going to be is this is going to be search but now as we said before only type property will not be enough because we also want to differentiate if an input has a placeholder or an actual text so i'm going to have to add another property so i'm going to my variants and i'm going to go to the more options and i'm going to click i'm going to click on the add new property and i'm going to say placeholder and if it's a yes and for this one it will also be a yes and let's actually show some versions of how these things would look like so i'm going to have new one for the text and one more for the email so and i'm gonna move this up and this is the hassle with the variants i wish they had a drag drag and drop right it would just resize recenter itself vertically but it doesn't so i'm gonna drop these yep and this one will be the no placeholder and this time it is actually going to be like jason mamoa and it is actually going to have dark yes that's how it's going to look like this is where a user has actually put in their name and right now we have the email and i'm going to move this as well this is going to be the email input field with an actual value not a placeholder and aligning these things is a bit difficult but we will do a polish soon so this is no and email yes place i don't know and what we want here is this is email and what we want this to be also is basically jason hot mail.com and i want this to be dark blue boom and that looks pretty good then what i want to do is i will not give the second type for password in an actual production we would actually have password show and not show but in this application we are not using that variant so i'm not gonna add it no need to go over perfectionistic here but i'm gonna add the second version of the search so in this search we have a search and the placeholder is yes and in the second one which i'm gonna delete because i'm gonna pick this and if i press but like plus it will duplicate it which is pretty good for figma and it will be london and that will be dark blue and that looks pretty good i kind of like it and that's now basically align these things basically space them pretty good maybe distribute them vertical spacing yep and get them left aligned that looks better okay so we are done with the adding the search input field and we added the other options for our name and email field such as adding the option type a placeholder or not now i think we are ready to actually design the discover screen and let's do that in the next video guys oh now the long waited moment of actually designing the new screen and let's zoom in let's do shift 2 to zoom in and this is our screen and we have a status bar which we already created the variants for we have a text big title text asking where does the user want to go and then we have a search field we have the filters and then we have the favorite cities as the city is the first thing a user will pick before an activity oops my bad and so let's do that so what i'm going to do is i'm going to press on f and i'm going to pick iphone mini and i'm going to drag the one that is created to here i know our design actually document is getting crowded we have to actually move things around a bit but i just want to do this screen first before we do that maybe finish the discovery part too as well so now what we will do is basically we will go to our assets and because we already did the heavy lifting i'm just gonna pick stuff i'm gonna go to my i'm gonna click on the status bar i'm gonna drag one here and i'm gonna basically zero for x 0 for y and that looks actually pretty good then what i want to do is i want to press t for creating a text field shortcut and i want to write jason where do you want to go and i know already that the type for this will be bold header so that looks pretty good and i do not want this to be out of it because it would what could happen is it would actually go over the whole screen because it's too wide so what i can do is i can give this an auto height and i want this to be left aligned obviously and let's zoom in here a bit and i want this to have the color of dark blue and that looks pretty good and around here is pretty good and where do you want to go and that looks pretty good so far so then what i want to do is i want to add the search field so for that i wanna okay so for this and again the what's happening is all right the it's the media recording software i'm using is bugging the figma because it's basically overlaying it in front of it and that is pissing me off but hey we did it so this one will actually be a search and look at that look and then we will have our filters and i am going insane with my recording tools guys i never thought this would be a problem but hey if you are using a recording to irish there was an option to pull it to the maybe top side that would be fantastic but it's it happens it's not that perfect for only so i have my filter element now and what i'm looking at this design screen is we basically have a horizontal scrolling view option means basically the user understands they can actually tap with their thumb and move to swipe to right or left to move left or right and that is only shown as a signal when the some half part of this filter element is actually hidden so the user understands visually okay for me to see the remaining part i need to swipe so that part is very important so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna have four i'm gonna double duplicate this two three and maybe four times but first let's make this istanbul so istanbul and what other cities do we have we have vienna and new york okay so let's make this vienna and let's make the last one new york and that one can be new york here i'm double okay fingma is bugging a bit new york and that's good and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to select all of these and i'm going to frame them and then i'm going to maybe make 24 pixel and i'm going to move the x here okay that's too much maybe 12 i think 12 is the right i think 12 looks pretty good there maybe yeah 12 looks pretty good i'm gonna check the distance between the top elements and i want the search field to be at the 24 pixel i want the text to be at the 24 pixel and maybe around here and that's pretty good and then what i want to do is i want to actually group all these guys into a frame and that is with ctrl alt g and i will rename this as filters and that's pretty good so now i'm gonna go maybe one pixel up because it's 24 pixel it's consistency with the left and right margin that is pretty neat so i'm gonna go what else am i missing i think we are missing the i think the half of the screen is done we might have some spacing issues we might polish later on but let's just add the new text now so i'm going to press t for the text shortcut and i'm going to write favorite cities and what i'm going to do is i am going to pick for this color dark blue and for the text size i think i'm going to go with the sub header bold and i can make this out of it because it's not that big enough to actually go overflow of the screen and once we have our sydney text i can now add the cards which we already created the variants of so that's handy so i'm gonna put myself here for you guys to see and oh i'm gonna pick this one here all right so we put our cards here and now just like the filter element our cards are also horizontally scrollable and we do the same basically signaling saying because half of the card is actually not seen on the screen the user understands i have to swipe and that's exactly what we are gonna do as well so this is gonna be here and i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna do this and now what we want to do is we want to grab these three and make them a frame so we can actually add some auto layout so i'm gonna go layers and i'm gonna name this as favorite cities i think i think thing might put it outside of our iphone frame i'm going to put it in i think that bug kinda tried to ping my sometimes bugs a bit so what we want to do now is we want to add an auto layout here of maybe 24 pixels that's that's too much maybe 16 maybe 12. i think 12 does the job and we want to center these and we probably want them to be centered here and now what i want to check for is our alignment for the text so i'm gonna press shift r and i'm gonna get it here and we are almost there but i think i think for the text we are good i think for the text inside the status bar we can do a bit more left but it doesn't matter too much because it's something outside of our control we don't design these these are given by the apple so i i don't have a problem with that part okay so now our alignment looks pretty okay for the vertical now then what we can do is we can actually pick the cities so the first is amsterdam berlin and prague so this one is amsterdam berlin and proc and that's pretty good so i'm gonna check its distance to the top that should probably be closer than 24 pixels maybe 16 would work pretty good here and i'm gonna get even closer maybe so what i'm trying to see is what's the bottom spacing here it's i think four pixels so if i get it to 12 it will actually be 16 pixel difference so that looks pretty good i'm gonna click on it i zoomed out too much shift two okay so this looks pretty good i'm gonna add the favorites to these text and so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna so cities this is favorite cities cards so if i were to put this text here you wouldn't see the text because it would actually try to auto layout the text as well so that's not what you want to do what you want to do is actually we have to go back what you want to do is you want to close this cities frame and you want to frame these two as well and that will be favorite cities that's pretty good so now we can actually duplicate it by pressing alt and drag and we are gonna do that with shift so it doesn't change and that looks pretty good so let's see so one thing i want to make sure we have is our bottom navigation as well and you can you see how easy it is to add these things once you have created the variants already and oh i think our bottom navigation width is wrong so it might be a good idea to go back and check it so it should be the whole screen so that should be 375 pixels so i'm gonna look at here and i'm like okay so mod would be 126. okay that's too much so for here what we want to do is i think for the vet we want it to be fixed and that should be 375 pixel and for each of these also the bits should be fixed it should be 375 pixels so let's do that and these mistakes happens guys design is an ongoing process nobody does it perfectly one thing i learned from my once i turned this into a fulltime career and i'm a fulltime aux designer we always make mistakes and you making a mistake is actually your opportunity to learn something and develop so do not judge yourself as harshly when you make mistakes we all do it's not an if but when and your reaction to your mistakes will actually determine your outcome you can choose to learn from them so i now learned how to that i should double check my bit when it's for variants so i'm going to go back to the to my nav screen i'm going to rename it to be discovery discover part one and for the second part we have top picks for cities so this should be top picks and the third one should be let's see under eyes okay so then what we can do is so i'm gonna check the distance between these two that should be 24 pixels maybe well it's also related so maybe 16 as well so then this one is also 16 and that looks okay maybe we can go so in here i did 24 okay i understand because they are each separate so maybe 10 so what i'm doing is if i press shift it just does double so it just actually does 10x so it moves 10 pixels down or up so i'm trying to get to 24. so my math is failing me and so in this one the in the second one the images so while we are using the same cities we are changing their uh location so this one will be berlin this case and in this one this will be berlin and then what is the middle so amsterdam is the middle so amsterdam here is the middle part and this one will be prague yeah and that looks pretty good to me i'm gonna do shift i'm gonna just move zoom out a bit and that looks pretty good i'm gonna check my spacing so all of these can go one pixel up for 24 pixel yep that's pretty good that is pretty good and yeah all these can go one pixel up because it's a 25 pixel there and yeah maybe maybe one more so maybe everything in here can go one more pixel up and that looks pretty good i'm just gonna check the high so 68 therefore y 68 here yeah that is perfect so that is our discovery part 1 screen and we can also do the second part very easily what we will do is we will duplicate this screen and we will rename this discover part 2 and what we can do is we can actually pick a city here and the top i picked london but i want to pick istanbul my hometown so i am gonna actually go here i will swa i will toggle it one thing figma does very well on variances if you actually created the variant property and gave it the value yes or no it actually understands that it shows it as a toggle so yes no it's istanbul and then what i want to do here is we have a placeholder now and this should be not text but search and so one thing it doesn't have oh so i think we made a mistake here i think we didn't create the search field well so let me see here so what is this field search yes okay so in some part here we actually made the type search and placeholder yes have two different uh mappings meaning there's some another element that also has the same values here so let's quickly search search yes okay so this is okay this is yes search this is search placeholder now okay so now the mistake should be resolved actually so if we go here we say search placeholder now and we can type this to be istanbul that is pretty good and that is our second pick guys it is our second discover screen that looks pretty good to me and yes i will see on the next video so let's move on to the actual detail screen i'm going to zoom into it by pressing shift 2 and this is after we picked a city and we picked activity this is the screen we see and i'm looking at the screen and we already have the status bar we already have the icon for this we have the background image which where we know we can use unsplash to actually get it and we have the text here but one thing we do not have is we do not have these avatars and this is meaning these profile pictures with the labels below them that tells the user who who are attending and what are their names who will you meet and we also don't have the the small link here so if you look at this link like this cmore and call is a bit different cmore is basic it's going to extend but sealed is probably going to create a popup co is almost like a button here and it's something we call a tetriary button where it's not even a secondary button with the stroke around and with the background like in our large button let me show you so it's not even this but it's almost like it doesn't have a background it's just a text with the underline on it but it still functions as a button then we have these cards which we don't have so it looks like we have three four things here we need to do the avatars variants so that we can actually have multiple versions of this you probably need a small button variations right now we only have large button variations but we know in the next screens especially here we will need smaller versions of those buttons and that's an entirely new category itself so they will have to be a new variant group and then we will need these cards these benefit cards i believe like this activity is cost friendly or this activity can make you friends or something else so let's begin with the avatar variation so what i'm going to do is i am going to zoom out a bit and i'm gonna play press f for short key for frame and i am going to title this frame as avatar images and then i'm going to do shift 2 to zoom in and i'm going to press all for a shortcut for a circle shape and i'm going to make this basically 48 by 48 and i just want to check if it is 48 let me check it looks like 60. is it 60 i want to see it is 60. okay not wrong because 48 look just a bit small to my eyes so let's do 60. and one thing i want to do is i want this circle to first not actually have a fill and i want to right click and use my plugin user profile which will actually give us random profiles now ah to actually install the user profile plugin i want you to click on top menu go to plugins we did this before now actually installing a plugin and and then what you can write here is user profile and once you're done i want you to filter by plugin not files and then i want you to install the first one here and then come back so once you install you can actually use the plugin now so right click go to plugins and go to your user profile and you have a few options now i want male female i don't care and i want to insert a random photo and then what i want is i want to press and i want to write here what does this guy look like he looks like an anton i do not know why but he does so i'm gonna make this a body regular and then i'm going to center these guys and i'm going to press both of them and i am actually going to frame these two together so i can create them a component and then make them a variant so this is my frame of uh maybe large avatar because i know in the later screens we will have a small avatar so large avatar and then now the next thing i want to do is i want to actually make this a component so i'm going to press ctrl alt k for shortcut and now it's a component and i'm going to add a new variant what is the attribute we are doing basically depending on the name of the person their looks is going to change now of course two people can have the same name and their face will not be the same but not for our avatars if the name is different they are probably going to have a different image okay so real life exceptions don't count so i'm going to right click by selecting the circle i'm going to go to user profile and i'm going to insert another random photo awesome and that looks like to me mary i'm literally judging stock photos here but that happens that's life so i'm gonna click right i'm gonna go plugins again user profile the same okay george and one thing you can do here is actually is you can do an auto layout for vertical and then you can center and this is a very good idea for each of them because like we see here if the name gets too long we stopped being centered and you have to then spend time centering things and that is not an ideal use of our time so i'm gonna do auto layout and i'm gonna center each of these maybe two pixels yeah 2 pixels might do the trick actually and add the auto layout center and 2 pixels there we go okay so george is good let's add a new one and i'm just gonna add a new one so five is good enough so let me replace these as well okay all right i'm gonna name this guy luke and i'm gonna name him matthew alright so this looks pretty good so we have the avatars now and now one thing we don't have is well we have the content we haven't specified the property or the values so right now if we were to actually create like fetch an instance here we would not we would just have variant two variant three those are not name those are not values that we could actually remember six months later when we are going to use this variant and say what is variant for but the name is much more memorable so that's what we are gonna do now the property is going to be name obviously so name and then i'm gonna go through each and i'm gonna give them the name anton mary and this process might actually be boring but it really pays off guys because this is the only repetition we will do anything else we will do is when we are going to use this on design is just drag and drop all right i think i'm pretty good with my avatar images and i think they look pretty good all right so let's move on to create the next set of variance and i want to do the small button versions basically i want this this is our one of the tertiary version of our button and on here we have the secondary and the primary so i'm going to zoom out here and i believe we do not have for the small buttons a disabled version i think we might actually add it a disabled version might actually work well so what i'm going to do i'm going to actually buttons here and i am going to add this variant to the buttons but what i'm going to do is i am actually going to inside here i'm going to click on the frame and i'm going to press f to create create the surrounding box for my small button and this is probably gonna be 32 pixels maybe 96 starting i mean it will have a auto layout but let's say 32 pixels and 8 pixels border radius okay so what we will now do is we can fill it with let's say white but probably blue all right so let's get this and let's put the text on it let's say done oops sorry guys my typing skills are not that good today and done and bodybuild that is pretty good i want this to be out of it and i'm gonna have it here and i'm gonna click on my frame here and i'm gonna rename it as i'm gonna rename it as small button perfect and then i'm going to add an auto layout on it and i probably want to make its vet for now fixed and centered like maybe it can grow but i just want this to be like yeah that looks pretty good to me actually it's in version that looks pretty good i just want to make sure i want to double check if i got the height right and it looks like i did get the height right maybe it can be a bit wider right this is a bit wider so maybe we can do that make this a bit wider and the other label we can use cancel that is actually a bit longer so what we can do here is we can center it and maybe do 32 32 and maybe not make it fixed and that might be pretty working and let's see if we add text it will actually dynamically resize it well so that's good because we want the cancel to actually have the same padding as well but let's make the height of it fixed and let's make that center okay because i will make this a compound by pressing ctrl alt k and now it's a component i can make this a variant boom so this is our primary button and how we are going to do this is basically we are going to have just like our large button we are going to have an active state or a priority state and because in the future if we don't know if our small buttons can also be disabled so for now we can just add them and in the future they might actually come useful so let's add the property active and then i'm going to click on this more options button to add a new property and the second property will be priority all right so okay so i'm going to go to the first one now and this is active that is yes and priority primary and i want this to be our secondary button so i'm gonna click on the button and i'm gonna press shift x to actually switch the fill value with the stroke value and i'm gonna click on that label and i'm gonna pick blue and i think we have to make this our white here yes so this works pretty good and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to press to create another variant but before that i am going to say yes for active but priority is secondary and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to create third theory and for that what i will do is i will actually i will get probably i might get rid of the surrounding uh i might get rid of the surrounding button here so what i will do is i'm just gonna come here i don't want a stroke value there and i want to resize it to the i want to resize the surrounding frame to the width and height of the text so i'm gonna hold alt and i'm just gonna yep maybe a bit larger so just a bit larger so that it doesn't cut off the labels and that is our third here button so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna click here and okay and let's go up here and say active yes and priority tertiary which is a very hard word and let's check if this one also goes out of bounds okay so one problem we have here is this if we actually increase the width of the element it doesn't increase with the element itself meaning the auto layout doesn't resize so let's check if we have the auto layout so let's look at here yep probably want to hug its content it's just maybe we can reduce the padding it has yeah so this might work better actually yes this works better so how about we do it this way and one thing we want to do one more thing is we want to underline this so i'm going to go to its label and i'm gonna go where is it so that is correct where do we underline this i am searching on figma all right this style alignment now maybe control you now okay so let's go here text underline hmm i think for some reason this did not work why would that be okay for some reason the underline doesn't work i do not know why it doesn't work so far but we can figure this out later i will figure this out on my own this is the this is the small buttons we have so i'm going to rename these as small button that's correct and this one is large button and we should be able to see it in the assets and let's close the editor images button navigations and if we scroll down and move on the bottoms we have now the large button and the small button and that's perfect i will see you in the next video all right so we are going to design the benefits cards in the details screen but i want to tell you that i found a problem with underline here so if i'm clicking the text and i look at the more options i can see that it is actually selected as underlined so the problem is we do not have enough margins at the bottom to show the underline and to actually do that we have to go back to the frame of the label and if you look at here our vertical spacing is fixed so first we have to actually make it a hug content and the moment we did our height stretched a bit to the surrounding margins that we had specified and now what we can do is we can reduce these to the minimum amount that will still be enough to show the what would you say to show the elements underline an element itself and that looks pretty good and then what we can do is we can actually make the now we can actually make the height fixed and that is yep that works that works that's the one so we have our underline there now so we can move on so now i will move to the details screen here and our so our secondary button our small button is done as a variant our avatar is done now if you can see here these are our cards our button overflows them actually because our booking now button actually has a primary importance but actually in the background you can see these cards listen like what is special what is the benefit of this let's say activity why are all these people going and so for that what we have visually is a basically a white rectangle white background we have a text at the center of it that is vertical and then we have a icon on the right side in a circle that is enclosed with a circle so that is what we are going to design so i'm going to go and press f we are going to make this a variant as well as you know because we might have different variations and i'm going to name this benefit card and i actually am also going to get its color to be with eye to this one because it has it is going to be a white rectangle it's hard to see on a white background as well so i'm gonna press f and i know the vitalfit with the circle is 327. so if you pay attention here you zoom out a bit let me go back so you can see that the button which is a 327 pixel width has the same width as the card but for the card you have the rectangle and the circle at the right top side so it is the rectangle plus the circle size that ends up having the same bit as the large button we have so we gotta calculate the size of the circle as well it's probably 24 pixels but it's at the middle part so the calculation is a bit tricky so that's why what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna fill it with white immediately and i'm gonna give it a stroke here the same stroke we use 4 to 16 10 pixels and i'm gonna make this also have eight whoa all right and we probably want this to be like 48 as well that is too much what's happening so maybe 256. yeah that kind of looks okay but maybe we can get this to be a bit longer and i am literally just exploring sizes here maybe this can be 32 32 and i know its color is actually the blue that we use so if i were to add this here if i were to look at both of these frames okay how do they look like right now so this is going to be the card background and this one will have a text inside of it that will say let's just copy and paste the text there so let's just ctrl c come back here yep okay wait where is that circle okay that circle is there i think the text disappeared i'm gonna recreate it and i'm gonna paste this okay then i can actually make this out of it that's good and i'm gonna make this text to actually have the style of a normal body it is regular perfect and let's look at it so it's 15 15 i want it to be 12 and centered and again centering is usually difficult with vertically as we talked about let's look at the spacing here three and a half four in the bottom so we are much more biased uh for the bottom so we want a bit more on the top so that looks pretty okay yes so that looks a bit more centered and now what i want is i want this button to actually have an icon as well so i'm going to go here nope i already have my icons in the assets panel and i am going to pick the money and that kind of looks a bit too big what i will do now is i will actually head over to our icon set and i'm going to resize some of the icons because as we talked about so here where we made the icons components so as we talked about while the surrounding box of the icons are the same the sizing can actually change and we might want to have different sizes so this one is actually like let's see so let's see the inside elements for the dollar sign i'm gonna go layers and that's 12 14 that's 22. so i want this actually to be resized and i wanted to have i want to use my icon resizer frame how you can install this you can go to plugins and then you go again browse plugins in the community and then you can type here icon resizer and then you will go on plugins filter and then you can install it and once you install it come back to here click on plugins and go to icon resizer and this lets you specify an icon box site which is 24 pixels which we want and maybe the maximum height to be 16 and that's pretty good and i'm going to do that for most of my icons here so i'm going to do icon resizer probably 16 and i'm gonna probably do it for this one as well plugins icon resizer 16 okay and that looks pretty okay so far i won't do it for my bottom navigation or these i think those two or three will be enough yeah i think those two or three is enough so let's go back and actually add our actually delete actually now that you can see it actually shrunk a bit which is good we are going to pick its color right and that kind of works so now i am going to actually group the ellipse with the dollar sign okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to rename this as the benefit icon and now what i'm going to do is i am going to frame i'm gonna get the card background frame and the group and i'm gonna frame these as well so i'm gonna press ctrl alt g for frame and this is gonna be my benefit card and then i'm actually going to make this a component and i'm going to add a variant perfect and my second variant is going to be let's look and before adding the second variant i think we forgot to check the size okay so our size is still pretty small so what we can do is so i know this circle actually will be half the it's with inclusion it to add its width we are only adding the half of its bit to the total because it is at the inside of the card a bit and that is like 16 pixels 327 pixels is the total width v1 so this should actually become 311. so and then this circle should move so let's make this move 10 pixels okay and let's let's also increase this sure okay so this is getting a bit buggy okay so right now it's not centered yet correctly i think okay so this is 32 i think that is pretty correct so far okay so let me see the total with here 326. so maybe we are missing in okay i think this can be now correct okay 327 64 pixels i think that is right i want to see if the height of this element was 48 pixels it might be 32 in the actual design let's see let's go back and let's zoom in and let's see inside that was 50 actually okay so that's actually pretty long element i will keep it at 50 i will keep it at 48. and that is our element so now we can just add the second variant and i'm gonna get it to be a bit closer and this one is actually going to have an attribute of benefit and this one is going to be budget friendly and this one is basically going to be maybe exercise and i'm going to get the text for the second one as well from our screens so yep so i'm gonna just ah just yes okay let's say this active helps you burn calories figma is breaking out a bit so i'm just gonna say this activity helps you burn calories 30 and that is a very weird saying activity helps you burn calories and that looks pretty good i'm gonna replace this icon inside as well so i'm gonna add the icon of the exercise here and i'm gonna change its color to white and that is perfect so that is pretty good i think that does look pretty good but let's see i don't think that's putting the same so i'm going to just get this to be here and yeah that is our benefit cards guys let's see if we forgot anything i don't think we have that looks pretty good only thing we have to do is make this exercise that's good i think we can now actually begin designing the detail screen all right now that we have actually designed the variants we need for the details screen we can actually begin and design the details copy screen so what i'm going to do is i'm going to press f for shortcut frame and i'm going to click on iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna rename this as details copy and what i'm gonna do is so basically first i need a status bar so i'm going to my assets and i'm going to close my icon set inputs and just going to grab a status bar here and i'm going to put it to zero 0 and so one of the things i'm realizing is we need a basically a rectangle element for the background image so i'm going to make this 375 pixels maybe it's like 192. might be a bit bigger than that one but i'm gonna make this go zero zero and i will go to layers and i'm gonna rename this background and then what i'm going to do is i am actually going to go plugins and i'm going to add an image here from the unsplash and it is the same image we had for biking and yeah so that's the image i'm going to add and maybe 256 instead of yes that looks better and i know that this needs an overlay so i'm going to add an overlay percent actually looks good maybe 25 and that looks bigger and now i'm gonna zoom in with shift two and i'm gonna compare here so what i need right now is so i'm going to move the status element above the image so it will actually show and i want the status bar to be basically white and that looks pretty good and then what i need is the back chevron icon so that the user can actually go back so i'm gonna go to my assets to my icon set and i'm gonna get the chevron left icon here i'm gonna put it around there and i'm gonna basically select its color to be white and that's pretty good so far then i will add my text for biking and then i will add my load um some text so i'm gonna copy this and i'm gonna t and i'm gonna just copy and paste here and this is probably gonna be just a regular and then what i'm going to do is i need for the location my location icon and for the pricing i need my dollars icon so for that i am gonna bring my dollars icon here and for the location i'm gonna pick my map icon and that looks pretty good so i'm gonna look up and i'm literally just adding the stuff we need like the bottom navigation so i will just move my profile here so i'm like bottom navigation and you can go in any order you want for these i just know let's see if this is complete bottom yes i think this is it for it yep i think that is vertically and horizontally centered let's just zoom in a bit to see if we are actually centered at well maybe we went overboard a yes that is the correct coordinates and then we have a basically a long paragraph with about but let's finish the basic card design with the activity background there so i'm gonna get another t for london ontario location and i'm gonna make this autobit and i'm gonna make sure this is regular and then i'm gonna make sure it is actually white here and i'm gonna make sure that the location icon is also white perfect and then i am gonna make sure biking is actually a regular header 34 bold and i'm gonna make it out of it as well and we are getting there i believe we are getting there pretty good now in the original design there are some mistakes that i'm not repeating here like this sharing icon to match the other icons actually should be is 2 pixel but in the new design we decided that we want each stroke to be one pixel so that's okay and i'm looking i think i'm also missing this 38 dollar person yes and so let's begin arranging some stuff and i'm gonna basically put this at 24 and what i want to do is i actually want to see the layout so i'm going to do alt shift 4 oh that didn't happen so ctrl shift 4 sorry yes ctrl shift 4 to see the layout columns we have and in this one so what i want is i want a layout grid i want to do columns 5 margin 24 that's also 24 maybe 16. yeah that works so based on this i now know how to actually align my items and so it should be around here and this one because like we said a horizontal alignment is also sometimes difficult because you see the fonts which is starting from here the actual font is for the biking b starts here so there's like three pixels of empty space and when you are aligning things those three pixels matter so that is how the proper alignment would work and this is around there so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to get london ontario and location icon and basically move all of them just a bit yes so that mattress maybe get the london ontario a bit closer and i'm gonna make these centered that's pretty good and now what i'm looking for is what's the distance i think it should be around 12 to 16 pixels there so i'm gonna group these i'm gonna actually frame these so this is the location location info and this one so for this one where did our i think we had a dollar icon but it disappeared oh it's there i just didn't change its color so let's get it to white and let's frame this with ctrl g and let's just go to layers and let's say price info for them i'm like okay and let's move this here and let's make our stream smaller and what i want to do is i actually want to do an auto layout to our frames and this i'm going to center them and that's pretty good and i'm going to basically press ctrl or i think no i think it looks pretty good right yeah i think what's the distance between these two that's one pixel i think it can be so if you zoom in the surrounding so the icon inside the locations is like four five six pixels away so maybe two pixels would make it eight so i'm gonna make this two and i'm gonna add an auto layout here too i'm gonna center it and i'm gonna make this two as well and then i'm going to get these to be aligned and i'm gonna zoom in again and these have to be moving to left a bit so that we have a left alignment with the biking this one needs to be moving here yes and then i am gonna get this a bit closer not that close but somewhere around here yeah somewhere around here would work what's the distance here so that's eight pixels ten and i wanna look at here two four six seven that's 18 pixels so maybe one two back and that should be around 16 and that looks pretty good so now what i'm going to check is the distance between here that is let me zoom out a bit that is four pixels eight pixels plus 11 here and that's 1922 23 that is too far away so what i'm gonna do now is that i am actually gonna go up and compare and contrast so you can see how our bottom here is 24 left is 25 that's something we want to do as well so i'm gonna decrease the height here a bit and i'm going to check its contrast that's too much so this should actually be from 24 in the left to 24 at the bottom so and now that we align the height of it to the actually baseline in the second line this is actually pretty accurate 28 pixels is a pretty accurate tire so i'm gonna maybe 24 perfect and i'm gonna get both of these to be down as well maybe here 15 and 19 so maybe one two three that's pretty good and i'm gonna get this down as well and that is three eight and up three eight two that's fifteen to sixteen maybe one more up and at sixteen and that's pretty good so what i will do now is i'm gonna actually look out and decide if the position if the positioning of the arrow icon is pretty good and i think it is like we can always get this time to the left like we have it above here but that is actually in the production not in our control like these are things that you get custom from the apple ios kit so you actually don't have much control there all right so onward to the second part i'm gonna press shift two to zoom in and what i'm gonna do is i am gonna press t for text shortcuts and i'm gonna write about and i'm gonna actually go and copy all this paragraph till here actually all of them actually yes here copy all of them and i'm going to basically press t again draw one and then paste all that text all that websome text and i'm gonna make this basically go regular 15 left aligned it and now one thing that actually we might need to do here is we might need the 15 pixels here it's let's just finish the let's do the header first because i think our spacing is a bit different so you can see here we are a bit spacious and we are at 17 pixels so maybe not the body regular but maybe regular here that looks a bit better yeah so i think this height is a bit better and what i'm going to do is i am going to pick this as bold sub header and i'm going to make this go out of it and i'm gonna make sure that our color here is dark blue and then i'm gonna go up and i'm gonna do the attendees as well so i'm gonna drag this header with the alt press and i'm gonna basically write here a 10 these 34. i'm going to make a left line here and i'm gonna also make this go out of it and maybe here it's a pretty good idea then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna add our avatars you didn't think we would use them did you so i'm gonna go here move my profile and i'm gonna go avatar and i'm gonna add them here so this is anton and let's see how many we have there we are roughly five four six and because we can see a beginning of my next hours are just at the edge of the screen so that signals to the user that you can actually swipe that's exactly what we are gonna do we are gonna then have six avatars so let's do two three four five six and let's select all of them and make them a frame ctrl alt g and then we will write this as avatar frame and we want the auto layout so we can add spacing around tanks maybe 16 pixels and we definitely want to center things and we yes we definitely want to center things and now we we probably want them to be around here something let's actually how do we center this thing so let's let's see i think this is the center for us that's not quite right so let's think this through maybe 12 pixels because i remember how it looked and okay so is it true that we got six of them yes so maybe 24 okay so our spacing is too small so maybe 24. let's see so yeah i think 24 is the spacing we used 24 is a bit too much and it's you know i'm not respecting the horizontal distance here so because in here it was 12 i think 12 will work better so i would much rather ask to have 12 around here so i'm just gonna do okay so that's 25 to 20. so maybe let's check now that's true okay i went the wrong way to three that's 21 2 okay so let's see maybe minus 22.5 and that's perfect and now let's pick everything to be different so let's pick this to be mary let's pick this to be george let's pick this to be look or matthew and lo no let's pick that matthew and let's anton again and that's fine so and the distance between the avatar and the attendees should be roughly 24 pixels but we will get there so next i think what we need before we space things up is actually get everything we need so we need a small territory button here so i'm gonna select the details go to assets again and we will go to buttons now and we will get a small button and we will make sure that it is active but territory and that will be like see all all and let's see okay so here's a mistake so so we needed to be hugging its contents but then why is it not hugging the content of c all so what did we do here maybe we gave it a second okay it's because we made it not have auto of it but no it should have auto of it so okay so that looks pretty good see all here is that right okay so maybe like the initial s is capitalized which is fine all right and maybe this one's too okay so that's a bit better let's enter this a bit up all right and let's check it here we need the cards for the benefits and so i'm gonna open here and i'm gonna definitely get my benefit card right here all right so my benefit card is there and i'm gonna get rid of the the columns there ctrl shift four okay that looks a bit better and so one thing that i want to check is what is the color of this details copy and it should match our white here that's good okay so this should be 24. yep and so i'm gonna get this up as well i'm gonna check so this should so there is a bottom margin here of four pixels so this should be like twenty one two three four okay that looks pretty good and then what i'm going to do is i am actually gonna get this up as well so i'm gonna check 24 and it's this for this paragraph i don't need to go and check because it's line height matches where the frame where its actual height is so 24 pixels per tag 24 pixel there is actually 24 pixels so then what i'm going to do is i am gonna press ctrl shift 4 just to see where i should have ended here and i'm going to zoom in a bit so this should be a bit to the right yes i think that is correct and maybe down yes that works i'm to move my profile here and then i'm going to check the distance between there that is also 4 pixels so that should be also 20 because 4 plus 20 equals 24 which is the distance we are looking for that's good and then i'm gonna make this to be 24 but i'm gonna get this height to be nope my bad set i'm gonna check maybe 24 here and then i'm gonna copy and paste it here like that so it's like so i can drag it here and i'm gonna go layers the problem right now we have is that the benefit card is above the bottom navigation which is not what we want so i'm gonna pick the bottom nav here oh my bad guys i'm gonna pick the bottom nav here and actually move it up so it is actually above the benefit cards it's around here and i want this to be exercise and i want the distance between these two yep i want the distance between these two to be i think i think around here let me just move things here yeah so i think we can give it this height i think we need a bit more height here so i'm gonna make things smaller so now i can actually move these two up and i'm gonna check that's 24 i think for this we need 20 that's 20 and for these we will get them up two that's 24 and for this i want 16 as they are the same elements and that's pretty good then what i can do is i am gonna get my so i'm gonna check how far away am i and i think i'm missing a bit so okay so with avatar in the previous app i actually had just 16 pixels and with this i just had okay so i just had 16 pixels there so maybe because attendees is related to the avatar that makes sense to maybe move them up a bit so one two three four five six seven eight and that should give me 16 pixels there and but these for these i am gonna move up yep and that is pretty good okay so now i'm gonna add my main button logan i'm gonna add here and this should be 24 pixel to the navigation so it should be one two three four five six and that should be the book now okay that's good and again the main difference we are having here is i'm going to press shift 2 and press shift 2 so i am looking here and i'm gonna change its color to be one moment i made a mistake i'm gonna change the text color to be here dark blue that is fine it is blue that is blue and yeah i think those are pretty good i think i'm gonna get rid of the columns now and let me check that looks pretty good compared to our original sample i think our coloring still hasn't updated but let's do maybe white 100 yeah that looks pretty good yeah i think for some reason we are not getting this color i don't know why like this is the white color isn't updating well i will figure that out later but for now this works i like it i think it's a bit more spacious than what we have here but i still like it and one thing that it has here is this yeah overall it looks pretty good i would say so i think it all looks pretty good yeah i'm proud that looks pretty good all right so that is the details copy guys i'm gonna check here that looks pretty good i think these two need to be centered yep that looks better i think that's the only part but yeah i think this looks pretty good i'm very proud and in the next one we will go on to the variant so we can actually begin the scheduling screens and i will see on the next video guys right so the first variant we are actually going to design is this drop down so to show you what this is i'm going to press shift 2 and basically we want this to have two options one is when the drop down is closed and then the other is when drop down is open and it shows date picker so basically we will have one state where the property is open or meaning is the drop down open and it's a yes or no value so let's do that that's basically go here press f and do and right drop down and then i'm gonna press f and before that maybe change the color of background to be this and i'm gonna then go to the draw go zoom in shift to and then i'm going to close the benefit card and i'm going to find the drop downs and i'm going to add a fill to the white and i'm going to make this 8 and i'm going to make sure we have white 100 and i'm gonna get its height to be 40 pixels as that is the standard height we have for the most elements and then i'm gonna make its overshadow to be 16 pixels on blur and 10 percent here perfect and i'm gonna probably get its split to be 327. just in case it takes the whole bit of the available content area on the iphone 13 mini and then i know it has a text label so it should be like pick a day and let's think this true and i'm going to zoom out a bit because i'm realizing maybe there is more than two values so i think there is two more than two values because or maybe there's two but when it's closed you have to select a day but when it's open you actually you actually have to have here an actual date okay so there is a mistake here in this design where so can you see even if the person picked the 30th it should actually write 30 june 2022 but the design here is wrong so so the drop down can have multiple values in the first i think that there are okay there's two different properties the first one is this is the drop down open or closed but the second one is does the drop down already have a date or not if it doesn't you should write select the dates but the dropdown also might have a date that was picked but we wanted to change so we will have open we will have s properties open and we will also have date packed or not yeah so that would give us roughly four versions so i'm gonna go here i'm gonna zoom in here and i'm gonna add the in the assets the chevron we have from the icon set let's begin with the share run down and let's pick its color to be dark blue let's pick this color to be dark blue as well and then let's check the distance here that is 12 and 15 15 and let's give this the 15 auto and that's pretty good and we want this to be 12 as well so this will require a bit zooming in here to find out all right so in here we have 11 and there is five pixels so we really want to go maybe seven yeah i think that's right so and then we want to go 12 here i think that should give us this that should give us 12 by 12 left and right that's pretty good so pick a day i don't need the auto layout here because the date will never be that long so i think i will just make this a frame now with the ctrl alt g and i'm going to write this drop down and then i'm going to make this a component with ctrl alt k and then what i'm going to do is i actually will give this a variant here and i will give the property the first property to be open oops open and i will go to the more menu add new property and that is has date or let's say picked date okay so let's do this so so let's say select the day here is better select okay so for this one what we have is is it open no is a date picked no and the second one what we can do is we can actually pick a date where we can say 20 22 june 20 22 and what this means is we are are we open no have we picked the date yes and then what we can do is we need two more of these and so we will have four variations and in this one we are also are we open yes and when we are open we do not and let's say let's pick the date no when we are open the share run down icon actually has to turn into the share run up icon so we need to get rid of the share run down we go to our assets and we get a share run up icon and yes that is the way and i'm gonna remove this so that's the share run down and i'm gonna just basically give this to be the same x coordinate 296. and i'm going to check if it's equal it is equal and then what i'm going to do is i'm gonna press and now i want this to be picked yes and i'm gonna give this 20 20 to june 2022 and that's all of our options guys good morning everybody so let's actually move on with the looking at the scheduling sessions i'm gonna show you here so before we actually get to design these screens there's one more variant we need to actually finish and that is the date picker you can see this element i'm gonna zoom in by pressing shift two and you can see the state picker and basically what happens if any user decides to pick a day for their activity they click on the apple drop down and this opens up and they get to pick the month the date etc now the hard part with this element is actually the content of the days because you actually have two ways to visually create this content you might actually do it column by column like this horizontally or you might do a draw by row by row and to keep each spacing equal you have to use auto layout otherwise you have like 60 margins that you have to align yourself between each date like between 1 2 and 1 8 and 8 9 and 8 15 and this just cascades and for me i found it much easier to do auto layout with the row by row solution so that's what we are going to do now before we design again we have to think what are the states of the speaker in terms of variance and there is two states as far as i can see the first is basically a date picker that doesn't have a picked date yet which is this side and the second one is a date picker that has a picked date which is this one where we have the blue color so that's what we are actually going to do and i'm looking at what we need and one of the things we need right now is this right chevron but if you look at here we don't have a right share run on our icon set so we actually have to go back that was a mistake by me so we actually will go scroll here go to our icon set and let's look at here so let's see this one here and i think what we need is we actually got the same one so what we need is a right share run so i'm going to right click go to plugins and we will go to fedora accounts which was the plugin we used to actually fetch our icon set and we are going to write chevron and i want the right chair run here and i got it that's pretty good i'm going to my layers now and the hard part really is that with figma sometimes it's difficult to actually put things like plugin icons into the what would you say into the frames because they don't you they don't put it usually often so like it put it outside of our icon set frame even though we put we actually fetched it inside so sometimes you have to do this manually like this go and put it there and once we got it we have a few things to change again our color is never black we want dark blue and then what we also want is that we want the stroke width to be one pixel so i'm gonna go inside and i'm gonna pick fun and now that that's done we will actually make this a component by ctrl alt k so now again ctrl alt k so now our chevron write is a component and it should show up in our assets you know panel and let's look and it's there all right so we are ready and done with our icons so now what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna actually create the frame that will hold the variant so for it i'm going to press f for frame shortcut and i'm going to write here date picker and that's all good and swell so then what i want to do is i want you to take a very good look at this visual because what we have here is basically seven lines i seem like monday tuesday wednesday thursday fridays saturday and sunday and we have at most six rows so we have seven columns six rows and how we are going to do the design is basically row by row by row so it will be like row here row here row here okay i think i made a mistake i think i should have done it fit the column i think i'm mixing what i call them in a row is and i apologize for that guys but let's look at my solution okay so i think i did it by column by column right yes this is a column this is a column this is a column okay column by column is a solution and i named them wrong these are all columns so that's what i will do column by column by i apologize guys it's been a long tutorial all right so let's go all right so i'm gonna go here and i'm gonna first change the background color to this match this one and then i'm gonna get i'm gonna zoom in with shift two and i'm gonna press f to create my frame parent frame and this is gonna be 200 327 pixels we know this because it stretches to the left and right sides of the margin of the screen and for the height we are going to give it right now 256 pixels now i don't know if that is good enough we might increase it if we need to but let's go so i'm going to fill it with our white color and i'm going to actually add a border radius of 8 pixels it already started looking nice i'm adding a drop shadow 4 16 10 percent which is our general drop shadow and now what we can do here is this we can press t to add the text let's say june 2022 and i'm gonna make this a basically a regular sub header and i can have it here and i'm gonna make this autobit that's pretty good and then what i can do is i can actually fetch my icons that will let the user pick the amount they want to pick on the right side here they might select on the right side so i'm going to get my share on left and i'm gonna get my chevron right okay so chevron right was a bit harder but we got it and i'm gonna actually maybe get these guys a bit more closer now maybe a bit above all right so then what i want to do is i want to do my first column so that would be with t and what i'm gonna do here is basically i'm gonna do m and i'm gonna make each of these take the autobit and it won't be a subheader it will actually be a regular body text and i'm going to zoom in now so what we need here is so this is m for monday and what we need here is first 8 15 22 and 29th of the month so then i'm going to like have to drag this basically and this is going to be one and this is gonna be eight and ahmet are these dates accurate for june 2022 i don't know i didn't check the calendar maybe they are maybe they aren't but i don't think it matters much this is a prototype after all but it is 29 and that's the first column so what we want is that we actually want to make this a group here so we want to do this we want to frame this and we want to make this the first column all right so first column works and then we wanna basically duplicate this but first let's give it a bits of spacing so between each element we might want 12 and we probably want them to be right aligned yeah i think i like to write a line better maybe center might also work and we will figure out what kind of an alignment we want but we can check our solution again if i did center or light so let's check it okay i think we did center in the solution which is fine sometimes you can also do write a line if it suits you it really is your call but one thing i want to do is i want to make the first m which is the date to actually be body bold and i also want each of the text color to be dark blue not black yes i want this to be dark blue as well okay so that looks actually not bad so i'm going to actually drag this to duplicate and i'm going to drag this okay i'm holding shift so that my horizontal alignment doesn't change four five six and don't worry about the horizontal spacing between each column we will actually accomplish that when we frame each of these columns into a parent frame and that will let us put horizontal spacing distribution the way we wanted so this is actually so i'm gonna go tuesday and this is 2 9 16 23 30 and this one will be 3 10 17 24 and 31st so any element after this actually we made a mistake will not have the last row because 31st is the most you can go so what we will do is we will remove this and we will actually drag this one and this one and this one yes so that's monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday saturday and sunday yeah i think that looks pretty good so excuse me let me just drink this tea it's very early in the morning so i need my energy okay so 2 9 3 10 17 24 31st this should be 4 11. if i make any mistakes guys please don't tell me i'm kidding you can't tell me we all make mistakes it's okay especially this early in the morning this is 12 this is 19 and this is 26. i definitely made the typo summer 6 13 20 and 27 and then here is 7 14 7 14 21 28 okay that looks pretty good all right so now what i want to do is i wanna select all these columns that we did and i want to frame these by with the shortcut ctrl alt g and this is the dates frame and i will what i will do is i'm going to check the spacing between each element here which is 12 pixel and they are centered and what i will now do is that i am going to add an auto layout to this parent frame and i'm going to make this 12 as well now ahmet is 12 enough probably not because if you think about a person is going to use this app on their mobile phone and you probably want a much more margin between each number because you want this to be very easy to tap between thumbs so let's try 16 for the columns as well so let's try 16 here so i'm gonna just go through all columns here and yes i'm gonna go through all columns here so 16. so what i'm going to do is i might speed up this portion of the video i'm just going to go through each column and make these 16 and i will see when the actual design of the dates are done yeah i think that looks pretty good so now another thing we need is our cancel button but also before that we should realize that 256 wasn't enough so i'm gonna actually add 32 pixels there to 888 that might be better and even this might not be enough but let's see so another thing that our actual element needs is the small secondary buttons so i'm gonna show shift to so look at here we need the cancel and the done button and then we will also add these circles that the basically if a circle is not filled it signals what day it is right now unlike the time you are using the app and the blue circle that is filled means that that's the data you actually pick the activity to do so here is a good question that the previous design here didn't answer if you are on 29th june 2022 should you be eligible to pick the dates beforehand you already cannot go back in time so that is actually a design mistake you already cannot go back in time how can you be on 29 june and have the option to select previous days whoa that's a past mistake for me all right yes let's let's correct that shall we let's let's do better yes that's the motto let's do better so first we are what i'm going to do is i am actually going to add our buttons first i'm going to get our small buttons and i'm gonna make this active yes this is gonna be a secondary button and this is gonna be cancel yep and cancel looks pretty good and then i'm gonna duplicate this by dragging and this is gonna be a primary button saying done okay so far so good 288 is definitely not enough maybe three or four okay so now what i'm gonna do is i am going to pick a date here and i am basically going to let's say we are on the date 16th okay so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna press all and i'm gonna put it oops my bad i'm going to press o and i'm going to put it around here and this is going to be 24 to 24 maybe 32 32 and it's gonna have no insights and it's gonna have a blue around now i'm not gonna put it inside our date frame because the moment i do it will try to arrange it to like a date and our alignments here will get messed up so one simple trick you can do on ping maze i'm just gonna use the coordinates to pick a date so i'm gonna go to left so i'm going to literally i'm holding shift so i can move 10 pixels at a time and i'm gonna go up here and i'm not gonna align it like this maybe here and that looks pretty good and i think this one is also supposed to be like blue here that's the date you are on and any date before 16 means that it's not eligible for you so i am actually gonna almost make each of these dates to be like the gray yes so i'm gonna make these gray which is a disabled color that we have so that is 3 4 10 and i'm sharing these mistakes with you guys instead of redesigning everything because i think it is good to see other designers i actually am a fulltime designer and i make mistakes all the time man i make mistakes all the time and i think it is a very good thing for beginner or even mid levels to see that other people are making mistakes while still having a career and that's fine that's how we learn i think it's a very important thing so now the first day from the first to 15 is actually disabled we are on 16th and that's the first version of the let's say design that we have now we can actually worry about the small things like spacing so what i'm checking now is i'm checking the distance between everything i want this to be probably 16 or maybe even 12 nothing is 60 i'm gonna check our card design to see how what was the difference there like what was the margin left and right because we want to repeat that for consistency so i'm checking here and it was 12 by 12. okay so let's do 12. i'm going to go here shift 2 zoom in a bit more and let's go here 12 by 12. so i'm gonna do 12 here 12 there and i want to make sure that that is roughly 12 but that should probably be eight for the text what's happening oh like eight yes and both of these guys can actually go here and i'm gonna check the distance here and that should probably be a bit closer because of the surrounding box and i'm gonna check here okay so that's roughly 9 12 that is correct and with these icons you usually eyeball it if you are very very detailed you can just zoom in and count all of the rectangles which is what i usually do but let's get this to be and let's see if it looks like it is so let's select both of these elements okay so it's almost like it is hitting the baseline there which is the where the most weight of this font like it's not the baseline but where is the most weight of this font of this type street that which is in the like around here right it's like it is not here because most of the focus of this font because we are using a lowercase for most of the letters is here and that makes it look pretty centered because that's where the middle part of this meets and i'm going to check the distance maybe get it here maybe i think this separation is pretty good so that the elements actually maybe they can be a bit closer yeah i think that's a bit better yeah i think that is better and another thing that we can do now is we can also check our spacing here so we probably want to go to 12 as well that is not good so that is yeah that's pretty okay now we might not be able to do 12 because now the problem is that while we are consistent with our card design spacing the hard part is that our outer spacing is much more than the inner spacing we have between each state right the the the marginal difference between 16 and 17 is 16 pixels while the whole parent frame at most has 12 pixel difference which is why it makes it look like we are very squished so you want to really have parent margins to be bigger so probably we will go with 24 and break the consistency so that should be like 20 here and 24 here and that should be like here and we should take it also here yes that looks a bit better and let's make this go 24 maybe for alignment 22 yes and let's get you guys to here and let's look at your bottom and let's move you guys up a bit as well and that is so the distance between these two elements is 12 pixels 8 plus 4 that is 12. that is a pretty good distance so what we can do is we can actually check again 12 so like it's almost good and you can see this element actually isn't doing the like it's not fully scratched i think it looks pretty good right now in terms of spacing i'm eyeballing it a bit but it looks pretty good the problem here is that the circle our circle around the 16 is not centered now and it is bugging me so it should be maybe around here nope around here yes no around here yes i think this now looks better and what i'm going to do is basically i'm going to write this as i think we did it is the date picker right yes picker and what i'm going to do is i'm going to make this a component now oops sorry i'm going to make this a component with the ctrl alt k i don't want to frame a frame i want to make the frame a component and that let's substitute the variance so remember from the beginning of the video we know that they will only have two state states the first one is that the date hasn't picked it is not in pick has not been packed the second state is that the date is picked so for that we need the property of date picked so date picked and for this one it's a no and for this one it should be a yes and we should change stuff so what we should do is let's say the user also let's click let's drag this okay that won't work so let's make a copy of it and let's just basically drag it here let's just say they did 18 and i'm gonna press shift x to swap the value that didn't work why is that okay so for some reason figma doesn't let me swap values i can do it the old way i can do it like this and the hard part here is that my circle has to be below my dates which is what i'm gonna do so that the date is visible and i'm gonna press for this one i'm gonna make this white and i think i'm gonna make this bold as well yes that looks a bit better and i think that looks like a selected circle yes that looks like a selected date i think that looks pretty good i think i like what i'm seeing what is the horizontal margin between these two maybe it should be 12. i really don't want it to be not multiples of 4 12 and that looks pretty good actually so that is our date picker all right so let's get started with our first two screens for the scheduling ones so what i'm gonna do is like always i'm gonna create my initial frame so i'm gonna press f and i'm gonna pick iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna fetch it here and i can do this as schedule part one now here are the elements that we already designed for our variants to actually for the screen is we have the status bar done we have our button is done i think we might not have the disabled version i will check but our large button is mostly done we have the bottom navigation and we have the date drop down now what we are missing is the stepper functionality for the adults and children here now i do not think these will actually need to be variants or the stepper function needs to be actually variant because now we are not using it as any other parts of the application you might actually make this in the future for a variant but for this tutorial's sake and to maybe not prolong it any further i'm not going to actually make the data variant i'm just going to design it here but as a homework if you want to bonus points from me and show me later and email your work to me you can make the variant on your own so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna just add our stuff that we have to use so like the i'm gonna move my profile here and i'm going to add the status bar let's say here i am going to where is my button i'm going to add the drop down here where is my bottom navigation show me where is it oh it's here okay so i'm gonna add this okay so the bottom navigations coordinates is 760. and that looks pretty good and this one should be zero zero yep and that looks pretty good and then what i can do is i can actually get the from my icon set i'm gonna get the left share run which actually lets us go back one step so what i'm gonna do is i am gonna go find our icon set and i'm gonna drag the chevron left right here and i'm gonna go to my layers and that worked subliminally pretty well and i'm gonna get this to be like 16 or let's see let's see from here what was the coordinates so 16 yes i was right so then we can get it here this would be 24 and so far so good i am now gonna check our i'm gonna check our large buttons to see if we have a disabled version if not meaning disabled variant if not we will need to design some stuff and we do okay i'm proud of us so we actually have that one so now i can also then that means i can also shift to i can drop our large button as well and i can disable this it's not active no so let's look again and this is the go to checkout part to check out all right and it's centered perfect so the only thing that remains now is to design the things that are not variants so for the text the main text schedule active i'm going to press t and i'm going to write schedule activity and i'm going to left align this and i'm gonna basically make to say i'm gonna move myself here and i'm gonna make this a top header bold and i'm gonna get you here yes and i'm gonna make this autobit and i am gonna definitely change this color from black to dark blue so it matches with our color palette and then what i'm going to do is i am gonna design this frame so it looks like it will have 327 pixels because it stretches horizontally and i'm going to fill it and i'm going to flip it to our white color and i'm definitely going to add the drop shadow because it's hard to see the white it's 4 to 16 pixels 10 percent and yes i definitely need border radius of 8 pixels which is what we usually have for the rectangle elements and that looks pretty good i think it will be taller so maybe 128 pixels yeah that is that might be too tall maybe 1008 and we will figure it out but the first things i want to do is i want to add the adult texture so this is basically the user selecting how many adults how many children how many people they will bring for the activity is it just you and your partner or is it just you or do you have a kid with you so i'm gonna make this also dark blue and i'm gonna make it out of it as well and what i'm trying to gauge here is let's zoom into the screen and that looks actually pretty okay i think we might need a double like no maybe not maybe yes all right so what we can do now is we can press r for rectangle and this is probably is the hardest part of this of this video because we are creating an element from scratch this probably has 48 pixels for height maybe not 48 but 40. yeah 48 might be a stretch i'm looking and 48 looks big maybe we thought with the border radius it might look smaller but now 48 is definitely back maybe 44 no maybe 40 is it 44 or 40 it's 40 yes because 48 was big so 40 pixels and even with that one we probably want the background to be blue ish and okay so then we want our stepper functionality minus m plus i'm gonna press r again and we might want these to be 32 by 32 and i probably want this to be eight oops i probably want the border radius to be eight as well whoa eight is too much maybe four yeah four is better and i want this blue to be a bit darker maybe even 300 nope 300 is too much maybe 200 yes i need 200 is pretty good and i'm gonna drag this and i'm gonna basically take this one pixel down so it's four four four and take this one pixel to right so it's four four four and at the center of it will be our text so yes to t and let's write this zero and i'm gonna have this to be bolded actually i'm going to have this to be bolded i'm going to have the centered and i'm going to have this autobit and i'm going to check the distance it has and maybe here it's seven to six so it's 259.5 and that is centered now i'm going to check the vertical spacing here and i'm going to zoom in to see that's three that's four so it should actually have one more pixel in the up so it should probably be here for centered no sorry my bad it should be around here okay so that let's check our work so far okay we need to get the icon i get that okay so maybe let's check it okay so we need our icons so i'm gonna go to our icons on our assets panel and i realize we actually do not have the minus four plus icon so let's go to our icon set very quickly and fetch those so i'm going to icon set shift 2 to shift shift 2 to zoom in oh what did i do okay so we are here shift two so i'm gonna right click plugins and i'm gonna basically check for feather icons i'm gonna check for plus and i'm checking for minus okay so i think i got both of these icons so one of them is in right now i don't think the plus is in the icon set but i think we can just by going down here so i have to drag the plus one okay so they are both in so both of their colors should be dark blue and i'm gonna make you guys go here and i'm gonna select both of them and make them a component oops make them a component and that's pretty good and oh they just okay my mistake i have to make them okay figma doesn't make you do a component for each so ctrl alt k for this one ctrl alt k for this one okay now it works now we are good so let's go back to our screen click on the screen shift tool to zoom in and let's just add from our assets panel our newly minted icons this is the minus and this is the plus okay those look pretty good let's make these all white and let's basically also make these guys have one pixel so i'm gonna have to go back because we didn't change their stroke yet so i'm actually going back to the icon set i know guys this is frustrating this is my mistake yes so that's one pixel ah they are both going to be one pixel and this is one pixel as well okay now we are good i know we are good enough again click on the screen shift to zoom in okay that looks better so let's look at this is this centered here i'm gonna basically grab this and make these two things an element so ctrl g to group and what i'm gonna do now is i'm gonna basically center both of these elements i'm gonna also do this for the plus side and then i'm gonna click both of them and center them yes that looks pretty good and then what i want to do is i want to name this sd yeah that part isn't useful i think we duplicated something that was necessary i'm going to name this background and that looks to me pretty good let's look at our example here i think our steppers can be a bit smaller but so here is the thing if we make it smaller they will also be harder to tap so this is really your decision if we get them smaller now they will aesthetically look better but then being big enough also might give the person a confidence to actually try to tap because they are bigger now 32 pixels i think in the design there are 24 there in the way i did it but there is also benefits to having it at the size so i think i will just keep it at size for the usability and then what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna design this by 12 pixel and definitely like eight or nine so i'm gonna zoom in here yeah definitely 89 here okay maybe 16 will be the way to go but then you might realize for you to solve this is a actually a good dilemma so so for you to actually center design these elements which is like the stepper elements oh we haven't grouped those yet okay my bad that's not the element okay so let's first make this a group shall we with the background and this is our stepper functionality so we will make this a frame and this is stepper and let's check if everything moves with it when we move it yes okay so we want to center design these two elements the adult and the stepper functionality and let's copy them and i'm going to show you a visual problem now what is and we have to grow this size it's 128. so what is the visual problem here now while the figma is telling you the distance is equal between the each row the problem your eye is having is the vertical space between adult to let's say children here is a lot more than the stepper functionality two and stepper functionality one so it's 8 pixels this is probably 30. and your eye is confused because your eye is usually looking for consistent spacing it's looking for one type of spacing if it's 8 pixels vertically it wants it to be 8 pixel on the right vertically as well whereas on the left we have a 30 pixel on the right we have an 8 pixel well how do we solve this what apple does is very smart in their design is they add a horizontal line so the moment you add a horizontal line your eye fixes on the lines and it just checks the distance between line and the top here and i'm going to show you so this would be like maybe 268 yeah maybe 2 72 and this would be a gray line and both of these elements would be down and so maybe even a bit longer maybe 282 okay tonight so let's check the distance here so yes maybe so that's 327 pixels so that's 20 okay so that's maybe 18 or 24 24 so let's group these and make this first row so that will actually make you understand better so let's group and this is first row and let's group this let's frame this and this is the second row and now i'm going to show you so now what we can actually discuss is this okay so what's the distance between these two elements gonna be and one thing we can do is we can even use auto layout to actually picking guests let's say one thing we can do is we can actually do auto layout to actually determine the distance now so you are going to see what i'm doing so what's the margins in the left right and other men other parts let's make them 16 here 16 here 16 here and 16 here and we want these to be left aligned that's for sure and one thing we can do here is this we can actually pick the distance between each item and what we can pick is let's say 12 and what i want to do now is to pick here so it's actually if we pick it 16 if we match it to the outer spacing that might even work better so if we were to do this so now your top spacing and your element spacing matches so that looks much more unified the only thing this has to do is we have that auto layout here too so we can match them so i'm going to add auto layout for this sub children like the roles so that we can actually horizontally center the elements as well instead of being the child being top alan i want them to be middle aligned and now that looks pretty good i'm pretty and takes the horizontal line our eye actually calculates the vertical distance from this line to top from this line to bottom and the only thing we might have is no i think that looks pretty good i think we might be a bit we might have a bit more height here but i think it looks pretty good i think this is a bit more squishy yeah that's 136 pixels maybe we could have gotten everything to be 12 pixels on the left right and other parts but i think this part works so i think we might keep it 144. i think i like it and let's get this to be all right guys this is already getting to be a long video in the next video i'm gonna actually finish this screen the second one and see in the next video alright so let's finish the screen so what else are we lacking i think we are lacking alignment for and we like are lacking spacing so one thing i'm going to do is i am going to actually start with the checkout with 24 pixels which is r and i want to add i can actually do worship four and i'm going to add the layout grid as well to this one so we can actually check with check which items are aligned our margins left and right to be 24 pixels and 16 here and so let's begin with our header here and i'm gonna zoom in a bit farther okay that looks pretty good now maybe one more pixel yes 22 does it does the job and i wanna now i want to get i think this element is already aligned at 24 pixels so that's good i want to get the drop down to be aligned as well yes and then what i want to do is it doesn't need to be that down now the distance to be 24 pixel and i want this to be 24 pixel as well yes i want this to be 24 pixel as well one pixel more down and i'm going to hide the layout knob ctrl shift 4 okay so i think that is our first version now one thing we might do is i think in our drop down we haven't added the calendar icon that i have maybe it might make sense to actually edit because it helps so what i'm going to do is i am actually going to our icon set to fetch it and then i will add i will update the r variant later so i'm gonna go to right click plugins and feather icons and i can check calendar here and boom and i'm going to add this to our icon set so it's gonna be picked from left side here all the thing to here all right so now it's in our icon set and i'm going to basically make its color to be dark blue and i am going to change its stroke width to be one pixel and then i am actually gonna make this a component and before i make it a component this is actually a bit big so i can i might want to resize it so i'm gonna go icon resizer that is at most 16 pixel and yes that is better now i'm going to make this a component and i'm going to zoom out and i'm actually going to go to the drop down here okay so we might actually wanna have it here i'm gonna add it to all four variations so i'm gonna go to assets and i'm going to fetch it from here and i'm gonna move this a bit and i'm gonna get it here and one thing you wanna do is you want the emphasis to be less on the icon and more on the text and one way to do that while still keep consistencies while you make the two elements have the same color you can actually decrease the opacity of the let's say the icon in our case so what you can do here is you can make this eight percent and boom that already makes it better so what i'm checking here is what's the left margin there that's four so this should actually be eight eight plus four is twelve and these actually can maybe difference is four pixels here and yes that looks pretty good yes i think i really like the look here so i will just copy and i will move everything basically so this is 36 so i'm gonna move this to be 36 as well i'm gonna copy the calendar and paste it here and i'm gonna do the same for the other so 36 i'm gonna do here 236 and i'm gonna paste it here and i'm gonna paste it for this one as well and that looks perfect okay so let's go and one thing we can do is we can already realize because our variants are components once we make a change to the master element it auto updates itself and it looks perfect so i think this screen is done maybe change this color to dark blue so what we can now do is we can work on the second screen and that is basically us actually picking a value so that is actually picking the number of guests so this would be part two copy and scheduling part one copy and what we can do here is we can actually but the only change we will do between these two screens is make this two and voila we are showing the interaction now and that looks pretty good now at the end of this tutorial we might actually go back to change some of our drop shadows in certain elements to give them more emphasis but right now i want to make things consistent this looks pretty good so let's do the screens third and fourth so these are the screens where we will actually design so i'm gonna do is i'm gonna duplicate the schedule part two and i'm gonna duplicate the schedule part no i'm not gonna duplicate this one i'm gonna make this go to part three and all i'm gonna do is probably just add the date picker drop down and that looks pretty good so well one thing we are actually realizing here is this where we are actually going overboard here so so let's actually get this well the coordinates for this one is not correct so it should actually be 10 pixels lower maybe 11. yes so that is the coordinates and this should be also lower around here and this should be roughly 16 so 412 because this part of this element so it should not be just 24 pixels maybe even 12 would work yes so now now so this is how it looks like and right now it is not packed and one thing you might think of it is is there a problem with it opening over the checkout button i do not think so because our checkout is already disabled so that is pretty okay one thing we might do is we might actually move everything a bit up or we can also let's see how many so it should end around here if you really want to but that is probably not needed so i really like if it overlays i don't think there's a problem with overlaps i don't think there's a problem what i'm trying to think is what would happen once you picked it and you can actually go to checkout and then if you are trying to press the checkout button but you press here and it's all a mess okay so we need to decrease the height of this and we need to decrease our spacing around a bit so one thing we can do is let's go back here and this was 24 pixels as well what is the distance between each element here is 24 so so far we have 24 pixels so let's tank maybe we can get this to be up a bit so this is like 44 this is 66 so we can actually yeah i think that is the mistake so everything here has to go up so one two three yes so now yes so if you trick check here now our back button matches and i'm gonna do the same for this screen i'm gonna hold shift one two one two then i'm gonna so what i'm doing is the moment i hold the shift it actually shifts 10 pixels instead of one and for 22 pixels i have to do that twice then take my hand off and go twice again for 22 pixels and i'm gonna do this for here as well i'm gonna actually not do it i'm gonna copy again and i'm gonna add in my assets here and that should be pretty good yes that is a lot better and these should also be going down so yes so that is a bit better so another place that we can actually change is we can decrease the margins here and decrease the spacing around here so what would happen if we did 12 and with this 12 as well that still looks okay and yeah that still looks okay so we can actually get this up one two three four that should be 24 yes okay so you are seeing a lot of copying here because one mistake like we have made is our spacing well i made this our my spacing didn't work so we are trying just a bit of stuff here and i'm gonna delete this again drag this and now it should work probably let's see yes now it works yeah okay yeah and that is okay that looks pretty good to me and then what we can do is we are gonna rename this this is part three copy and we are gonna drag a new version of this oh wait i think so this should be two because we copied stuff we forgot to change these says two because they already made the choice of the adult at the point two in three they are gonna they open the date and then the four which we are gonna create right now they have selected the date so this will be selected the moment they press done then we are okay to go yes and this is the part four all right let's do the fifth screen so i'm gonna drag this one and i'm gonna write this as five copy and the thing the difference once we make a choice in here and we say done while we picked the date the user has picked the date they have not picked the time of the day that they are actually gonna do the activity in so we have to give them the option that they will also have to pick the time so what we can do is we can go back in our screens and basically copy this horizontal filter process which we have and we can actually paste it here and what we will do is we will just change the we will just first we will make everything to be unpicked and what we will do is we will just change the time so it's it will be like zero eight zero zero am and this would be zero nine zero zero am and then we might jump to let's say eleven eleven zero zero am because we are just showing the available times and then this would be thirteen 000 pm and so i'm gonna go to layers and one thing we might do is we might add an auto layout for this one and we might get this to be 12. yeah i think that actually looks better and we probably want to center this right for this one so i'm going to zoom out a bit i'm going to look here and i think i am going to get this to be off nope the other way 5151 that works and this should be 4 pixel above for 12 pixels and yes that looks better and then now that part of the screen is done then what we can do is we are gonna design the sixth screen so i'm gonna drag this one which is the last screen for our schedule and then we will have one option picked let's pick this one and then what we will have is this disabled button has to be also active and boom that looks pretty good actually i'm gonna vertically align these and yes those that was our scheduling feature and in the next video we will do the last two variants so that we can actually design design the last screen the review screen for the checkout so we only have one screen left to design and to actually do that screen we need two more variants the first one is what i would like to call medium cards varian which is this one where it is a bit different it's the activity one so only four activities and what it is is that it doesn't have a label for like that we had so i have to like zoom out a bit here maybe maybe pick one here i think around this and zoom in here so if you look at the activities here each of these activities have this label that signals what it is but for the medium cards that we use in the checkout they don't so we will have to create a new variant for this one and the second variant we will do for this screen is the small avatar images here these very small ones unlike our large avatar images which we use for the attendees these won't have a name attached to them like as in writing let's get those going so i'm gonna actually zoom out here and i'm gonna go to our image cards here what i'm gonna do is i am going to create a new frame i'm gonna name it small image maybe medium image card medium image card it's not that small so and i'm going to give this let's say a bit of 156 pixels i'm going to give it a fill and i'm going to give it eight pixels now what i'm going to do is i'm going to actually add the images and i know these medium cards will only be used for the activities like eating hiking or biking it won't be for the cities because you can never check out the city so what i will do is i will actually remove the fill color right click plugins and i am actually gonna go to unsplash and i'm gonna type eating and i'm gonna pick the same activities there and i'm gonna add the same overlay which is 25 percent if i recall let's quickly check and let's quickly check and it is 75 and i will check the height and bit of it actually so i am checking the height and width and its width is 212 to 148 so it's actually bigger than ours so maybe these are the medium ones i misnamed them card and this is going to be a large image card so so this is 2 12 to 148 pixels i'm actually going to make this a component by pressing ctrl alt k shortcut and then i'm going to add variance and first i'm going to set the property and the property will be basically activity and the first one is going to be eating and for the second one we are going to change its image we will look for biking here and pick it and let's name it biking and let's add one more and let's actually go for the hiking all right i'm gonna search for hiking and this one is weather yes so those are the same hiking and boom so now that we have it what we can do is that we will actually zoom out and we are gonna go to the avatars so let's zoom out a bit more and i am looking for where my avatar cards are maybe even if it's more and i'm checking trick and checking and so in the okay there you guys are okay there at the bottom i did not see these okay these are our normal so let me just grab this here and avatar images so if you have a large avatar you want to create a small avatar so to do that i am gonna press f and i'm gonna zoom in here i'm gonna do shift two to zoom in and i am basically going to make this maybe 36 to 36 and i will give it a border radius of 18 pixels to make it a circle and i'm going to give it a bottom line there and for the sake of this discussion i think i will change the background of it i to this so we can see things better okay so what i'm going to now do is that i will actually get images for this one as well so this will be named small avatar and this is maybe even like we can be a bit smaller maybe 32 pixels yeah maybe 32 and i'm gonna actually find an image for this so plugins and i'm going to use the plugin user profile that will let me generate a random one and that is not good let's do another one let's do one that actually looks like a profile shot okay that is doable so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to make this a component ctrl alt k and i'm going to add a variant and our property will be name just like our large avatar and this one let's say is lucy and for this one i am gonna do the same i'm gonna do user profile insert random photo and this one is let's say helen and i'm gonna go plus here and what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go random again and i'm gonna do this three to five times right oops wrong plugin my bad i'm gonna right click plugins user profile and let's see and that is let's say jane and then i'm gonna click again and this is the last one let's get a man here and that can be matte okay all right so let's begin designing our last screen to begin i'm gonna press f so i'm gonna press f i'm gonna pick my iphone 13 mini and i'm gonna make write this as review copy and the first thing we are going to do is we are gonna get our variants that we already designed so we are going to begin with the bottom navigation and we know the coordinate is 760 and x is zero and then what i'm going to do is i'm looking for the status bar so i'm going to move myself to the right i'm going to get the status bar here i'm going to make this 0. i'm going to make the y 0 as well and its colors over the dark blue maybe i should be around here yes then what i'm going to do is i am actually going to get our t for the elements and for the text and i'm going to write checkout i'm going to auto with the element and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to make this bold 34 pixels and i'm going to get this dark blue and then i'm going to get my maybe image cards and in here i want the large image card definitely and i want this to begin at 24 for x and then what i will do i will press t again and i probably want this to be biking then i'm going to zoom in a bit and i'm going to press t for the activity name right biking i'm gonna basically move myself back i'm gonna make this out of it and i'm gonna make this sub header so that is pretty good and then what i want to do is i want to get my location icon so i'm looking for my location icon right here yep that's my location icon i'm gonna get text for the place london ontario and i want this to be dark blue as well this one to be dark blue as well and i want this to be body regular and i want this to be autobit yes and definitely regular here and one thing you can realize is it is not enough this has to be a bit smaller so what we can do is maybe we can go maybe span element here that would work better yes that does work better and i'm gonna align those later then i want my small avatar images so for that i am gonna go amateur images and i'm gonna get a small one and what i'm going to do is what i'm going to do is i'm going to zoom in with shift 2. 0 and i am gonna duplicate this by dragging it and duplicate another one and another one and i'm going to make sure that all of these small avatar ones are centered and now what we want is basically them being on top of each other so the one that is most on top of each other in the logically meaning in the design also usually should be the most on top so that's the goal so this one would be let's say lucy and this one let's say make this helen at helen is definitely so lucy is going to be the first one helen is going to be the second one and let's say jane is the third one and yep jane is the third one and this one can be met okay so this is the most top this is going to be here this one is going to be the third yes so now then what i will do is i will just take all of these holding shifts so they would come 10 pixels back maybe around there so let's check the distance between those two elements that's 13 to 13 so maybe one more and 12 yes so we are looking for 12 here i'm going shift with my down key here i'm gonna check again yes that is correct again just 10 pixels at a time oh i'm holding i'm holding caps guys you didn't tell me how dare you okay i was making me say you should hold ship not caps okay i'm i was wondering why this is taking too long man so i'm gonna print these as avatars small avatars yes so that is correct and i'm gonna then move to here i want the color of this to be dark blue and i want you guys to be centered here and maybe let's fix the text and maybe move the text to withholding shift a bit to the there and i'm gonna count the distance so that is like five pixels here so maybe six seven so six uh i'm doing x okay so i know five pixel is here one pixel is there that's six we are looking for two here so it will make to eight for our icons i think that's pretty good we are to center it again and we are going to frame these as location that is pretty good and then the initial part is done then we will do the activity details so let's press t your activity details and these are going to be sub headers right so i'm going to my type system subheader and i'm going to delete left alignment and i'm going to do it out of it perfect okay then i know i will get pricing but let's first finish the your activity details and to do this with the right alignment we probably want to have a layout grid with columns and again it's 24 pixels left and right 16 in the distance and that's pretty good so we already understand that we might need to come back a bit but yes then we will add date so i'm gonna just press here this is gonna be date and then guests yes okay so date and guests and all of both of these will not be a sub header now but will actually be bodybutt bold and then we are going to add the small tertiary buttons of edit so let's add those two from our variants let's find our buttons and then get the small buttons here and we definitely want the tertiary option and yes so let's put these guys around here and let's name these edits perfect and let's look at here yes that looks pretty good so what i'm gonna look for now so edit option is there we are missing two body texts so t here is for the date june 22 and first i think it's june 22 june 22 june 18 22. let's check the date that we selected this 18 june 22 okay yes so this is correct and i'm going to make this body regular and i'm going to make this this way yes and then i'm going to go for guests here and that is going to be two adults zero children that's okay yeah so to align things better what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna zoom in a bit yes and i'm on a windows machine so my magic pad is very very like very sensitive so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to make this a line better yes so that's the 24 pixel that looks pretty good and i'm gonna edit this to the end so they would match that's perfect and these colors should be dark blue and everything literally should be dark blue never black so yes okay so then this is gonna go here and what i'm really trying to do here is i'm gonna check the spacing it should probably be 24 up oh 20 okay that's not bad so maybe 24 24 for us so i'm gonna do listen like this should be roughly 14 so i'm gonna zoom in i'm looking for 16 pixel total so four pixel there seven pixel maybe nine yes so that is the distance and this should be roughly 12 total that's four five yes that is correct that should be the distance and i am actually gonna get this up and the distance between drew 9 guests should be roughly 16 because they actually belong to a different group so the distance between data and activity should be the same as the guests and date which should be 16 so i'm zooming in there's three pixels here that's four seven so that should be roughly nine so two three four yes and it will be a bit to the left there we go and this one is also just a bit maybe not and this one is as well i just wanted to touch there yes and that's pretty good so far okay so now what i want is i want to patch this one as well and i want this to be five based on just like here literally i'm just copying my distances and that looks pretty good let's look at it from here and that looks pretty good now this has to be aligned so i'm checking here where it goes maybe a bit up no and i wanted to see how it's basically how it looks from here i'm gonna turn off the yes i'm gonna turn off there and i'm gonna press shift r to actually have a ruler present to see the middle point and maybe one pixel up so maybe around here yes i think that's the way to go and then what i'm going to do is i am going to duplicate this and i am basically gonna go down a bit and i am gonna have it around here and i'm gonna do my ruler again to check if it's aligned centerwise on the baseline no it's not so maybe one two three four five okay baseline again which is the middle of e and that looks pretty good yes i'm okay with that i'm gonna press shift ctrl shift ctrl 4 the right alignment is correct so we can actually frame these now so i like our spacing so i'm going to select every element so i can make them all a gigantic frame ctrl alt g and i'm gonna name this activity details so i can do the spacing of the whole element easier because i want this whole group to be 24 pixel here and this one is probably just going to be 24 here so that should be like should be four five yep four eight so that should be like 16 so maybe one yes roughly here is 24 for it and i am gonna get this to up as well yep and i really don't watch 18 pixels maybe 16 horizontally and each of these elements can have 16 pixels here so that's 10 so maybe one two three four five six and i'm checking for the vertical alignment with my shift r ruler tool and so this should be a bit to the right that's good and this should the smaller beta images should definitely come up and let's see their distance so that's ten so six plus four here that's ten so maybe six down two three four five six and that looks pretty good the only part is it looks too spaced out so maybe it should all be 12 pixels so maybe one two three four and let's do one two three four yeah that actually might look better that looks to my eye better that's roughly 16 pixels yes so let's check 4 7 that's 16 maybe even more right three four and i'm gonna do the same maybe this should be 164 and that looks better yes that's much less spacing and i'm going to frame these as well so gonna frame these three elements ctrl alt g and activity t basically review and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to do the pricing so what i'm going to do is i'm going to press t and i am gonna write this as pricing we are almost there it's looking good i'm gonna make this dark blue and you have done this before this is gonna be our sub header so i'm gonna make this go out of it as well and then what i'm going to do is i am just going to copy the contents of this text my bad so i'm going to go here ctrl c i need new text and i'm going to control v and i'm going to make this a normal regular and i'm going to also give this a auto width and make its color to be dark blue there we go and i'm just going to duplicate it for the taxes so i'm going to press alt with shift so that the alignment keeps not getting disturbed and i'm going to write 450 for texas so i'm gonna go here and write 450 for taxes shift 2 to go back to zoom mode and that's 77 okay so then we will have a total there okay so then what we will have is we will press alt shift and this is going to be our total and this one is actually bold and i'm going to create another text here i'm going to duplicate this and i'm going to write as 77 77 and yep that's already out of it i am gonna shift this to the right edge and i am gonna duplicate this one again holding shift with alt and i'm gonna write 4.5 and i'm gonna get it to the right alignment so what i'm looking for what am i missing is the final total number here then i will have to frame everything and my total is missing total cad so c8d here so i'm holding my shift and i'm pressing down and there we go and that is if my mat is correct 81 50 and i'm gonna yeah shift it here and that's pretty good so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to group all these elements i'm going to frame them ctrl g and this is your pricing and one thing i can do is and this could be a cool spacing i'm gonna frame these as well this is the fee and this is going to be taxes and this one will be total what this will let me now do is that now if i ever add an auto layout for the vertical i want this to be left and i want this to be maybe 12 pixel or let's go maybe yeah 12 works pretty good actually 12 pixel works here and i want this to be bold as well right here yes so that works and i'm gonna get rid of the layout grid now and i'm gonna make the color of this to be white these white as well yes i think we have to go back and recolor these because these are pure white it's a detail i just called let's go here i'm gonna come back just a moment guys okay this is why you should check your colors beforehand okay that should be good so but final thing we need is actually the paved frame with the edit option for the card and we have a preselected card and we also need a large button at the below so let's do that first let's get this one it is disabled so it's an active it's primary and it is basically pay yes so make a payment this would be the best one payments and i think this should be primer i don't know why this is disabled actually this should not be disabled at all so let's make this active and that should be 24 yes that's better and then we can add the card so i'm gonna press this has to go up a bit yeah maybe even more up here roughly yes 24 pixels and then i'm going to press t for writing pay with so pay vet and this is going to be a sub header and it's gonna be autobit and it's not gonna be black yes everything nothing is black yes okay so then we are going to create our card our card is 327 pixels press r i'm gonna get it turned 327 and 64 is probably gonna have at least eight pixels on the side it might have even more but eight pixels blue but it's gonna have our dark blue color and it's gonna have our name the user's name the expiry date the type of card it is and then it will have the last four digits of the card and so for that we are gonna have t jason malta and i think for this one we are okay to do it with regular span element that's okay and then we will need the the expiry date so i'm gonna just drag it here zero seven twenty five i'm gonna make this out of it and then i'm gonna get our visa icon from our assets from our icon set my profile here and let's get this visa icon and let's give it a color of maybe this blue now maybe it's 200 100 might work yes that looks pretty good and then i want these circles so i think they are roughly three or four pixels so i'm just gonna go in and do them so roughly 12 circles for the whole credit card so i'm gonna press all and i'm gonna make this four maybe five is even better yeah i'm okay with five so i'm gonna then drag here and then i can do is i'm gonna hold shift to drag with the same distance and that looks pretty good so i'm gonna now hold these first four i'm gonna hold the choose these first four make them have the white color and then i'm gonna drag this whole group and i'm gonna do it again and not again my bad last one we don't need it and then i think they are not spaced equally yet so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to say distribute vertically that's awesome and then i'm going to have the text last four digits which can be 3406 and it really should be a span element because this should be very small and yeah that looks pretty good i'm gonna zoom out a bit yes that looks pretty good to me this has to be at the edge so i'm holding shift when i'm moving it to the right and what i'm going to do now is i'm going to align the this one so i want 12 pixels up and left so i'm zooming in that's one pixel so this should be roughly 11. and it is two pixels so this one should be the y should be roughly here so 10 plus 2 is 12. that looks pretty good now i'm going to align it my bad now i'm going to pick the visa and i'm gonna go to x i'm gonna align it here i want these two elements to be aligned to the right well so maybe one more pixel there we go and i'm gonna check here that's 9 12 yes that works that works and i'm gonna then pick all the ellipses the number and we'll group these control g card number and i'm gonna click on the text here maybe one pixel up to be centered yes there and that's pretty good actually i am pretty pleased let's check the vertical and horizontal spacing here and what i'm going to do is i'm just going to copy the y from here so this is 6 21. so so this is like 621 and to look at its left alignment of 12 pixels i'm just gonna press alt that's 16. so that's 12. yes that looks pretty good because is no left spacing in the phone so it is correct so we are going to align these as well yes and let's get these guys to the bottom as well so that's nine maybe around here because we are gorging with the text here yes that should be pretty good so i'm taking a look and i'm gonna group all of i'm gonna make a frame out of all of these ctrl g this is credit card and let's see if we can move everything here after the background didn't come in so let's move this here background has to be at the bottom that's good and let's see oh yeah i don't think we took every element there so yeah the card number didn't come in so let's move the card number in this well okay so let's enlarge in but our frame is a bit off and right now my shortcut doesn't work so i'm just going to check the distance here and that can be between these two elements that is 12 we probably wanted to be in total 16 that's four that is good that is excellent actually we want here 18 24 that actually works so it actually works i'm pretty happy with it so there you go guys that is your screen at the end and yeah that is the whole tutorial i think it looks pretty good there might be some spacing issues here and here but if you have stuck a lot stuck along with me so far thank you for watching this tutorial i hope you enjoyed it and if you really like the free
