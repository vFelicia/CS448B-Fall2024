00:56 - spot a mile to check in the project that

02:32 - the first photo sauce is that it's very
02:35 - organized very modular and very useful
02:38 - and assign natural step after getting to
02:41 - know CSS and using it for a while the
02:44 - coding says seems to be really easier to
02:46 - maintain and easier to add another
02:48 - component easier to come back after time
02:50 - to and great for bigger apps great for
02:53 - working a team great for maintenance of
02:56 - the project and coming back to it later

04:08 - crossed for your success because it's
04:11 - really hard and I haven't just only get
04:14 - and it's harder to stay on a daily track
04:17 - of learning to code I'm focused on
04:19 - holding the whole thing and majority of
04:23 - the time I spend on coping or learning
04:26 - to code on learning to design but you
04:30 - guys really do it you know partially
04:32 - afterwards and still manage to do it
04:34 - successfully you wrong guys so it's

04:57 - timing coming back to it tomorrow this
05:00 - week because of the project that I also
05:03 - start soon I was comparing that to
05:07 - typing tools that I've using before but
05:10 - not a long time so I had to revise them
05:13 - once again and I decided on experience
05:16 - design when I do the designs for myself
05:19 - very often I do not use them at all
05:21 - because sketching gets very often enough
05:24 - majority of prototyping tools are really
05:27 - similar so if you know one it's easy to
05:29 - use the other one what's different super
05:31 - the backing to is very often the price
05:33 - and the level of functionality if it's
05:37 - really mad major product or not
05:41 - this week I gathered q brownie points so
05:46 - together I have right now 464 brand new
05:50 - points and and I was active but not as I
05:55 - wanted and but still the for the first
05:59 - four days I was active also Peter
06:01 - helping others so from monday to
06:04 - thursday i gathered few more homes to my
06:07 - 500 round challenge the article is ready
06:12 - right now to be revised by quincy and i
06:16 - want to publish it an integral x
06:18 - application and when we talk about this
06:22 - article I was focusing on how much did
06:27 - it cost me to harm this funding
06:30 - certificate and I focus mostly on data
06:36 - on numbers and later discuss details and
06:40 - man she knew sources so feedback and to
06:43 - think about sharing and came back and
06:47 - also what's next so let's show you the
06:51 - whole story right now I hope you will

07:10 - to it after one day something's coming
07:13 - to it and after longer break if I have
07:16 - time and polishing it so changing what's
07:21 - needed also expected things happen when
