With timestamps:

00:00 - Thanks for checking out this video, we're going 
to cover the basics of sass, and then we'll create  
00:04 - a project from scratch and deploy it. And I'll 
show you how you can easily include sass in your  
00:09 - workflow. And I want to give a big thanks to bow 
and free code camp.org. for publishing this video,  
00:14 - Free Code Camp is an awesome resource. And on 
behalf of the community, thank you for all that  
00:18 - you do. So before we get into this video, I'd like 
to quickly let you know who I am. I'm a husband, a  
00:24 - father and a programmer, I've got over two decades 
of it experience. I'm a full stack developer, I  
00:30 - recently decided to create a YouTube channel. And 
initially, I just wanted to help people. But after  
00:35 - my first couple of videos, I realized that it's 
actually helping me to become a better programmer,  
00:39 - I do research for every video, and a lot of 
times I come across things that I didn't know,  
00:44 - or a better way of doing things. So I'm learning 
and teaching at the same time. So when when my  
00:49 - channel is new, but I upload new videos every 
week, I'd greatly appreciate it if you check out  
00:54 - my channel and subscribe. And that's enough of 
this. Let's get into the video. So we're going  
00:58 - to go over the basics of sass, and set up our 
environment. And then we'll go through a project  
01:02 - from beginning to end using sass. There's 
timestamps in the description if you'd like  
01:06 - to skip through certain parts. So what is sass 
is a CSS extension language, and gives your CSS  
01:14 - superpowers. Once you see how easy it is to write 
and how logical and organized it can be. You'll  
01:20 - never write plain CSS again, you'll see what I 
mean in a minute. Let's look at what you need  
01:25 - to write CSS. First, you'll need a code editor. 
And I recommend VS code because it's open source,  
01:31 - and it has great extensions, and awesome community 
support. Now your browser can't read sass, so it  
01:38 - has to be compiled into plain CSS. But don't let 
that scare you. It's easy. There's several ways  
01:44 - that we could go about this, we could use node j 
s to run a compiler that will watch our sass files  
01:50 - and compile them automatically for us. Or we could 
use Gulp to do the same thing. Or we could use an  
01:57 - extension in VS code. And for this video, that's 
what we're going to do, we're going to use live  
02:02 - sass compiler. Another extension that we're going 
to use is live server. If you're unfamiliar with  
02:08 - VS code, and how to set it up for web development, 
I do have a video on that. I'll have a link  
02:13 - in the description below. Alright, I'm going to 
quickly walk you through installing the live sass  
02:18 - extension. So in VS code, we'll go to extensions, 
and we will search for live sass. And there you'll  
02:25 - see live SAS compiler, go ahead and click on 
that and then click Install. And after that's  
02:30 - installed, we're going to look at some settings. 
So let's go to our settings. And then we'll  
02:36 - search for SAS and then click on live SAS compiler 
there. And then you'll see in the format settings,  
02:45 - we're going to want to change the Save location. 
Now these settings are a personal preference. By  
02:52 - default, it will compile your CSS and put it into 
the same directory. And I prefer for the compiled  
02:59 - file to go into my distribution folder. So we'll 
click on edit in settings, Jason, and then here  
03:06 - we're going to add some settings. So these are 
your options. So the default is at the top here,  
03:13 - format is expanded. So there's no compression 
going on. The extension name is dot CSS, and then  
03:21 - the safe path is no. So that means it's going to 
go into the same directory as your sass files. So  
03:27 - you could also change the format to compressed 
if you want. And it will go ahead and compress  
03:32 - and minify your CSS all in one shot. And then you 
can change the extension name to dot min dot CSS,  
03:40 - and then you see what they're where we can put 
it into our distribution folder. So I'm actually  
03:45 - going to do just a combination of the two for this 
video, we're going to keep the format at expanded  
03:50 - and the extension is dot CSS. And we're just going 
to change the safe path to slash dist slash CSS.  
03:59 - And then we'll save that and we're good to go. 
Alright, now that we have all of that set up,  
04:05 - let's create a standard folder structure here. 
So I have a new project folder that I've created,  
04:11 - and I opened it in VS code. And let's go ahead and 
create a folder here called dist. And then within  
04:20 - our dist folder, we'll create an HTML file index 
dot HTML. We'll use Emmet. We'll use exclamation  
04:32 - enter, get a template here and we'll just name 
this tutorial. We'll add a link here to our CSS.  
04:45 - So currently, we don't have one but we will be 
adding it. Notice the extension here is CSS not  
04:54 - sass or SCSS. So this CSS file is what's going to 
be compiled. Once we've created our sass files,  
05:01 - Now, before we create our sass files, it's 
important to understand that there are two  
05:05 - syntaxes supported by sass. So there's the SCSS 
syntax, and it uses the file extension SCSS. And  
05:14 - this stands for sassy CSS is basically a superset 
of CSS, which means essentially, that all valid  
05:22 - CSS is valid SCSS as well. I'll show you that 
in a minute. But because of this similarity,  
05:30 - it's the easiest syntax to get used to and the 
most popular. Now the other syntax is the indented  
05:36 - syntax. And this was the original syntax for sass. 
And it uses the file extension dot s. css, the  
05:45 - indented syntax supports all of the same features 
as SCSS. But it uses indentation instead of curly  
05:52 - braces and semicolons. There are a few other 
minor differences. But we're not going to be using  
05:58 - SPSS in this video. So we're not going to go over 
those. Alright, so we'll be using the SCSS syntax.  
06:03 - And so let's go ahead and create that structure. 
So be sure you're in the root of your project. And  
06:08 - go ahead and create another folder here. And we're 
going to name this SCSS. And then within here,  
06:15 - we're going to create a main dot s CSS. Alright, 
now that we have that file open, we've got our  
06:22 - extension installed. So now you should see this 
watch sass at the bottom. So go ahead and click  
06:27 - on that. And you're going to see an output here. 
We'll see here that it's watching for our sass  
06:33 - files now, and it is compiling and generating 
them automatically. And now it's watching for  
06:38 - us to save the file again. And when we save it, 
it's going to automatically recompile and create  
06:43 - that CSS file every single time that we save the 
document. So we didn't add this CSS folder here,  
06:50 - but now we have a folder in dist. And so that 
extension created the folder, and it created our  
06:56 - CSS file. And of course, we don't have anything 
in our sass file. And so I don't expect to have  
07:03 - anything in our CSS file either. So remember, we 
said that any valid CSS is also a valid sass. So  
07:12 - let me show you what I mean by that. So here in 
our sass file, we can add, let's just do something  
07:19 - generic here, we'll say body background. And 
we'll set it to blue. And I'll hit save. And it  
07:31 - automatically compiled our CSS for us. So now if 
we go to the CSS file, we'll see body background  
07:37 - blue, just the same as we see it here. so we can 
write plain CSS in our sass file, and it will work  
07:43 - just fine. So I also have a live server installed. 
So I'm going to go ahead and hit that go live.  
07:49 - And here you see we have a blue website. So One 
important note here is that we should never modify  
07:57 - the CSS file. Only modify the CSS file. Every time 
the compiler runs, it's going to overwrite the CSS  
08:05 - file. So the first sass feature that we're going 
to look at is variables. And now you might say CSS  
08:11 - has variables too. And that's true. css does have 
variables now. But sass has had variables long  
08:19 - before CSS. Currently, CSS variables compatibility 
across browsers is about 90%. So that's pretty  
08:27 - good. And I don't see any reason not to use 
CSS variables. But when you use sass variables,  
08:32 - they don't compile into CSS variables, they 
compile to the actual value. So let me show  
08:39 - you what I mean there. So in normal CSS, we could 
add variables like this. So now we could set our  
08:53 - background here using a CSS variable, just like 
that. And so now if I save this, you'll see that  
09:01 - our CSS file is pretty much identical to the 
scss file. And if we switch over to our website,  
09:09 - we now have a gray background. So now, let 
me show you the difference between this and  
09:16 - the sass variables. So with sass, we can get 
rid of the root. And instead of the dashes,  
09:25 - we'll add $1 sign. So $1 sign indicates that is a 
variable. So instead of calling bar, we will just  
09:39 - input the variable. And we'll save this, we'll 
switch over to our website, and it's still great.  
09:48 - And let's look at our CSS now. We don't have 
any variables defined, it puts the actual value  
09:56 - there. So using sass variables has a 100 percent 
compatibility across browsers. Alright, next,  
10:03 - let's talk about maps. So if you're familiar with 
JavaScript, you could compare maps to arrays. maps  
10:10 - are lists of key value pairs. So I'll create one 
here. So we'll define a variable. And we'll name  
10:24 - it font weights. And then to to define a map, we 
start with parentheses. So answer a key. So we'll  
10:37 - say, regular will be the key, and then the value 
will be 400. We'll enter another one, we separate  
10:47 - these by commas. So we'll say medium will be 500. 
And then bold, will be 700 is probably not the  
11:03 - best example. But you can create a map of colors 
or different things. So that we have something to  
11:11 - really add this to let's put some HTML markup in 
here. So we'll add a div with the class of main.  
11:20 - And then we will put a paragraph and we'll just 
put some Mormon here 50. Right now in the body, we  
11:32 - could apply a font weight. Globally, if we wanted 
to get a value out of the map, we'll use map get,  
11:43 - right, and so it's looking for the map. And that 
would be font weights. And then the key would be,  
11:55 - let's say bold. So this may seem like a bit much. 
But if we have our font weights defined throughout  
12:04 - our CSS in many different areas, and for some 
reason, we want to change the way that the normal  
12:11 - medium or bold font looks, let's say we want bold 
to actually be 900. Instead of 700. I can change  
12:18 - it in this one spot, instead of searching through 
all of my CSS and changing it on each individual  
12:24 - line. Now before I save this, let me pull up 
the website. Oh, and our text, we forgot to  
12:31 - text color. Let's apply our color. And we'll set 
that to text color. Now we see that everything is  
12:41 - in bold. So this looks at our map, and we tell it 
which key to look for. It finds the key and then  
12:51 - it extracts the value and it puts the value here 
as font weight, we go to CSS, we'll see that our  
12:57 - font weight is set to 700. Right, next, let's 
talk about nesting. So nesting might be one of  
13:04 - the best features of SAS. But depending on how big 
your project is, be careful with too much nesting.  
13:10 - Using classes that can be reused instead of nest 
after nest is much better. But to demonstrate  
13:18 - nesting, we will look at our paragraph here. So we 
have a div with the class of main in a paragraph.  
13:29 - So let's look at the main div. First, let's say 
that we want to center it and add some margin on  
13:35 - the side. So we'll set the width here to 80%. And 
we'll set margin, top and bottom to zero left and  
13:48 - right to auto. And this is just plain CSS. So if 
we go here, we'll see now it's centered and we've  
13:56 - got some margin on the sides. Alright, so now if 
we wanted to style our paragraph, normally, we  
14:03 - would have to do main and then paragraph and do it 
like this. Or we could just do paragraph and that  
14:12 - would globally change all of the paragraphs. But 
we don't want to do that. with SAS, we can nest  
14:21 - so within main, we could just do this. And let's 
say we just want to put that font weight only on  
14:30 - this paragraph. We'll move it down here. And I'll 
save that switch. And we will see. Same thing,  
14:41 - nothing has changed. And if we go to our CSS, 
you'll see that it has written it as proper CSS  
14:49 - so that the browser can parse it. Now if we want 
to do this properly, let's add a class here to the  
14:57 - paragraph. We'll set it to Main paragraph. And 
then so instead of targeting the tag directly,  
15:10 - we can do main paragraph by saying save that now 
it compiles properly into CSS. But with sass,  
15:26 - we have some shortcuts. So instead of typing main 
again, we could take this part out and we can use  
15:36 - an ampersand. So ampersand equals the parents. 
Right? So let's save that and go to our CSS. Now,  
15:44 - it's not quite right, because its main underscore 
paragraph on its own, not within the main parent.  
15:50 - So to fix that, we actually have to use something 
called interpolation. What that means is we don't  
15:58 - want just dot main paragraph, we want everything 
before it. So we have to wrap the ampersand in  
16:06 - hashtag curly braces. So now what we could do 
is add a hover on the paragraph. And so we want  
16:16 - to add that on the paragraph, not main. So we'll 
nest that again. And this time, we'll use just one  
16:22 - ampersand. And we'll use colon hover like we would 
normally. And then let's just change the color to  
16:35 - pink. All right, now we'll save this. And if we 
go to our website, and we hover over it, now it's  
16:44 - pink. Right, let's look at our CSS. Let's see what 
happened here. So we've got everything separated  
16:52 - as it should be in CSS now. So let's talk about 
separating files. So with sass, we can create  
16:58 - partial sass files that contain little snippets 
of CSS that you could include in other sass files.  
17:05 - So if we're working on a large project, it's a 
great way to modularize your CSS and make things  
17:12 - easier to maintain. A partial is simply a sass 
file named with a leading underscore. So the  
17:19 - underscore lets sass know that the file is only 
a partial, and that it should not generate a CSS  
17:25 - file. So the compiler is going to ignore those 
files that begin with an underscore. So let's  
17:31 - create a partial here, make sure that you're in 
your SCSS folder. And we'll create a new file,  
17:37 - and we're going to name it underscore recettes 
dot SCSS. All right now in this resets file,  
17:47 - we're just going to include our normal resets. 
So we will do a box sizing of border box margin,  
17:56 - zero, and padding of zero. All right, just some 
normal resets there, I'm going to save that. And  
18:06 - then in our main CSS, we'll want to include them 
at the top here, because generally, we'll have our  
18:13 - resets at the top. So to include that, we will 
use an app import. And then we will indicate  
18:23 - the name. So notice here that we don't have to 
put the underscore or the extension. So now if  
18:32 - I save this, and we look at our main CSS, it has 
compiled our resets into our main CSS from the  
18:40 - partial. And also notice that the vendor prefixes 
are automatically added by the compiler. So what  
18:47 - we could also do is we could create another file 
here, and we could name it underscore variables,  
18:54 - that SCSS. And then in our variables, we could 
take all of these, and we'll put them into  
19:05 - our variables partial. And I'll save that and 
then I'm going to use Alt Shift Down arrow to  
19:12 - duplicate that and will include our variables. So 
now if I save that, you'll see that the variables  
19:25 - are still working. So by using partials, we could 
separate major components into partials. And this  
19:33 - is especially helpful when working with a team on 
large projects, we can break up the components and  
19:39 - work on them individually. Alright, so now let's 
talk about functions. So if you're familiar with  
19:44 - JavaScript functions in sass are very similar. So 
to create a function, we'll put it here at the top  
19:50 - and we're gonna say at function to define that 
this is a function and then we will name it so  
19:57 - this this map gets In the font weights down here, 
it's a bit much it's kind of ugly, we can shorten  
20:04 - that up, especially if we're going to be using 
it all over our CSS. So we're going to create  
20:09 - a function that is called weights. And then we're 
going to open parentheses. And we're going to put  
20:17 - an argument in here, we're going to put a variable 
of weight name. And then we're going to open it  
20:25 - with curly braces. And within the function, we're 
going to return. And we're going to use map gets.  
20:33 - And we're going to target the font weights. And 
the key is going to be our weights name. So this  
20:47 - variable here is going to be passed within our 
sass file whenever we call it. So instead of map  
20:54 - get down here, we're going to use the function 
name weights. And within that, we'll pass it  
21:02 - the weight name that we're looking for. And if 
we change this to regular, it would return the  
21:10 - regular weight. So let me save this. And we'll go 
to our CSS. Now we're looking for the font weight,  
21:17 - let's see what it what it is font weight of 400. 
Right. So that's our regular font. If I go back  
21:24 - here and change it back to bold, and we check 
our compiled CSS. Now it's 700. Right now we'll  
21:32 - move on to mix ins. And so mix ins are similar to 
functions. So to demonstrate this, let's add some  
21:40 - more HTML markup. So I'm going to just duplicate 
this, this paragraph here, when you use Alt,  
21:48 - Shift Down Arrow, create another paragraph. And 
I'm going to save that, then back in our sass file  
21:55 - in the main here. Let's say we want to display 
this as flex. And we want to justify the content  
22:06 - center and align items center. If you haven't 
learned CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid, I have videos on  
22:16 - those as well. I'll put links in the description 
below. Let me save this. And let's switch over to  
22:22 - our website. And we see now that our paragraphs 
are side by side, because we define them as flex,  
22:30 - by default, that is going to flex to a row, go 
back to our code here. And let's just say that  
22:36 - we have many of these flex boxes that we need to 
create. And we don't want to type display flex and  
22:42 - justify content and align items a million times. 
So we'll go up here, and we're going to create a  
22:47 - mixin. So at symbol mixin. And we're going to 
name this and we'll name it, flex center. And  
22:55 - then within flex center, we're going to put all of 
this content that we don't want to repeatedly type  
23:03 - in now within main, instead of typing all of that, 
we will include the mixin. So at include, and then  
23:15 - flex center, just like that. Now I'll save that, 
and let's check out our CSS. And in our main,  
23:24 - we've got all of our flex. And again, it's added 
all of the vendor prefixes as well. Now similar to  
23:31 - functions, we could also pass an argument into a 
mixin. So let's say we want to pass it direction.  
23:39 - And then we could define flex direction, as 
direction. So now instead of including flex  
23:52 - center, we're going to also include an argument 
here, and by default, it is a row. So let's, let's  
23:59 - define it as column. And I'm going to save that 
and let's go back to our website. And now you'll  
24:05 - see that they are in a column and not a row. And 
of course, if I change this to row and save it,  
24:12 - and now you'll see they're in a row, or so mixins 
and functions are very similar, but just remember  
24:19 - that functions should be used to compute values 
and return values. mixins should define styles.  
24:26 - Another example of a mixin is choosing between a 
light and dark theme. So by default, right now,  
24:34 - our website is a dark theme. So we could add a 
mixin and we'll name it theme. And we're going to  
24:44 - pass it a boolean value. So we can assign Boolean 
values to variables. So we will say light theme  
24:54 - and by default, we're going to set it to true So 
now, again, if you're familiar with JavaScript,  
25:03 - we can in sass, we can use if statements. So 
we're going to say if light theme. So that  
25:13 - means if light theme is true, then we're going 
to set background. Currently background is set  
25:22 - to primary color. But what we're going to do is 
we're going to wrap this in a light, and then we  
25:33 - can tell it how much to lighten up by we're going 
to say 100%. So it's basically going to invert the  
25:40 - color. And then we will need to set the color 
as well. Currently, that set to the text color,  
25:47 - the text color is white by default, so we're 
going to need to do the opposite. So we're  
25:52 - going to darken the text, color. And we're going 
to do that by 100%. Alright, so now to use this,  
26:04 - we're going to create a let's go down here at 
the bottom, and we're going to create a Lites  
26:13 - class. And we're going to include our theme, we're 
going to pass it that variable. So light theme,  
26:26 - true. I don't have to actually type this light 
theme, I could just say true. This makes it a  
26:34 - little bit more identifiable. Alright, so let's 
save this. And now we need to add this class  
26:40 - somewhere. So let's just, let's just add it to the 
body for now. Class of light, save that. And now  
26:49 - let's go to our website. Now we have a light 
theme. And so now if we change this to false,  
26:55 - let's see what happens. It's still a dark theme. 
Even though we have the class of lights on body,  
27:01 - it's still a dark theme. How is that possible? 
So let's look at our main CSS, we've got our body  
27:08 - here, remain over main paragraphs. But there's no 
light theme here. Go back to our SCSS. And we've  
27:20 - got it included here. Well, we've included the 
theme, and we've said false. So if we go up here  
27:26 - to theme, so if it's true, it's going to add these 
CSS styles to the light class. If it's false,  
27:34 - it's not going to add anything. So that means the 
light class is empty. So when the compiler runs,  
27:40 - if it finds a definition that's empty, it's 
just not going to include it in the CSS at  
27:46 - all. Alright, so if I go back here, and I change 
this back to true, let's look at the compiled CSS.  
27:54 - And now we have our light class, right back in 
our main sass file. mixins are pretty cool. So  
28:01 - I'm going to show you one more mixin. This one has 
to do with media query. So we're going to create a  
28:05 - mixin. And we're going to call it mobile. And then 
we're going to use a media query. So just a normal  
28:18 - CSS media query, we're going to say max width 
of, let's just say 800 pixels. And then in here,  
28:28 - we want to include content. So this content will 
be passed when the mixin is called. Now what we  
28:37 - also could do, instead of defining this, this 
width here, we could actually use a variable and  
28:44 - it would be better to use a variable because if we 
ever wanted to change, it would be easy to change.  
28:48 - So we're going to create a variable here called 
mobile. And we will just set that to 800 pixels.  
28:58 - And then back here in our sass file, instead of 
putting the value there of 800 pixels, we'll just  
29:07 - include the mobile variable. Alright, so now 
let's see, what did I miss here content? There  
29:17 - we go. Now to include this, let's say if the width 
gets below 800 pixels, we're going to want that to  
29:25 - change to a column. Alright, so here within main, 
so here, we're going to include our mixin include,  
29:34 - and then that is going to be mobile, and then 
within this, basically view this as your media  
29:43 - query. So what do you want it to do when it's 
below 800 pixels? So we're going to say, flex  
29:49 - direction, column. Right, let me save that. And 
I'll switch to the website. Alright, so let's make  
29:59 - this smaller And there you go. Once we get below 
800 pixels, it changes to a column. Right and then  
30:08 - move it back over, it's back to a row. Right. And 
then if we ever need to change the width, we have  
30:16 - the variables here where we can change our widths. 
Alright, so now let's talk about extensions. So  
30:22 - we can extend an element. And so the element that 
we extend it to would then inherit all the styles  
30:28 - from the selected element. So to demonstrate that, 
let's go to our HTML, we'll change the classes to  
30:36 - paragraph one and paragraph two. Alright, so now 
here, we will change this to paragraph one. And  
30:42 - so let's say that we want to extend all of the 
styles of paragraph one, on to paragraph two,  
30:49 - we want them to look the same, but we just want 
to change one or two things on paragraph two.  
30:55 - And we don't want to have to retype all of the 
styles on both paragraphs. So we could do this,  
31:00 - we have to interpolate again, the ampersand. 
And then we'll do paragraph two. And then here,  
31:10 - we could extend main paragraph one. And we'll save 
that switch. And now they're both identical just  
31:26 - as they were before. But now we want to make a 
change to this paragraph. So we've extended all  
31:33 - of the same properties. But let's say we want to, 
we'll use hover again. And this time, we'll change  
31:41 - the color to our accent color. Right, and so now, 
we have our accent color. So if there was a bunch  
31:57 - of styles here in paragraph one, and we didn't 
want to retype everything, we could just extend  
32:02 - from that class on to this class. The last thing 
that we're going to look at is operations. So,  
32:08 - addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. 
So in normal CSS, we could do calc. And then I  
32:17 - don't know why we'd want to do this. But if for 
some reason we wanted to subtract 40%. That would  
32:25 - work just fine. But in SAS, we don't need the 
calculation. And it will work just like this.  
32:38 - We'll hit save, go back in just the same. Now one 
thing to note, with the normal CSS calculation,  
32:47 - I could do minus 400 pixels. And see 
this will work just fine. But with sass,  
33:03 - we can't mix types. So the operation has to be 
of the same type. So if we're using percentage,  
33:11 - they all have to be percentage, or they all have 
to be pixels. So now let's see what that looks  
33:15 - like in the CSS. So we have 80% minus 40%. So now 
we just have the result of that, which is 40%. So  
33:32 - if we so if we use the normal CSS calc, let's look 
at what the compiled CSS looks like. So it's gonna  
33:38 - go ahead and pass that entire calculation into 
our normal compiled CSS. Alright, so that's pretty  
33:46 - much the basics of sass. So if you want to learn 
more, you can look at the documentation on sass,  
33:53 - dash lang.com. sass is very powerful. And once you 
get the hang of it, it's hard to go back to normal  
34:00 - CSS. Alright, now let's look at a real world 
example. So this is what we're going to build. A  
34:06 - portfolio website has this cool animated menu and 
several pages in the menu along with the entire  
34:13 - website is responsive. And we're going to take a 
mobile first approach when we build this. So here,  
34:20 - I've got VS code open, and I've created a project 
folder on my computer and then I opened it in VS  
34:25 - code. And all that I've done so far is I created 
a dist folder, along with an image folder,  
34:31 - and I just brought in the images that we'll be 
using in this project. I will have a link in the  
34:35 - description below so that you can download the 
project files as well. So in the dist folder,  
34:39 - let's start out by creating an index that HTML 
file. I'm going to close the sidebar by pressing  
34:47 - Ctrl B. And now let's start with our HTML markup. 
So we use Emmet exclamation, enter. That gives us  
34:55 - a boilerplate and let's title this and we'll just 
go with Mike's With a portfolio we're also going  
35:05 - to add our style sheet, which will be created for 
us from our sass. So we'll add a link. And we'll  
35:13 - set that to CSS, main dot CSS, and the body here, 
we're going to start out with a header. And then  
35:25 - we'll create a div with the class of menu button. 
And then within here, we'll create a span with the  
35:35 - class of menu button burger. So the menu button is 
going to be pure CSS, we're not going to use any  
35:48 - images or fonts for that. Within the header, let's 
create a nav, we'll have a class on that of nav.  
35:56 - And then we'll create our menu items. So we'll 
have a ul with the class of menu nav. And then our  
36:07 - allies will have a class of menu nav item. Right 
now, we'll have a link with the class of menu nav  
36:24 - link. And that is going to go so our first one 
will be home. So that's index dot HTML. And we'll  
36:39 - name that one home. Alright, so now we're going 
to take this Li and we're going to duplicate it  
36:43 - down three times. So Alt Shift Down Arrow, 123. So 
in our home, this is the page that we're on right  
36:50 - now. So we're going to set this Li to active. And 
then the next one will be our about. So we'll say  
36:58 - about me. And the next one is our projects will 
say my projects. And the last one is our contact.  
37:12 - And I will say contact me. Right, I think that's 
it for the header. Let's go to our main section  
37:24 - now. Alright, we're going to start with a main 
tag. And then we'll have a section. And we'll  
37:36 - have a class of home. And then we'll create an h2. 
And in here, we'll say I, my name is then an h1  
37:55 - with the class of home name. Then here, we'll put 
the name so Mike. And then we're going to have a  
38:05 - span with the class of home name, last name here, 
we'll put the last name Smith. And then we'll have  
38:20 - an h2. And this will be his titles. Web developer, 
designer, and programmer. Right now we're going to  
38:40 - add our social icons, we're actually going to 
put that in our sections still. So we'll add a  
38:50 - div with the class of social icons, and then a 
link. And that's not going to go anywhere. And  
39:03 - then we'll add the icon. So we're gonna use, we're 
gonna use Font Awesome, and I'll show you how to  
39:09 - set that up in just a minute. So we're going to 
use an icon with the class of FA be in another  
39:15 - class of fa, Twitter. And we're also going to 
add a class of FA times two. Right? And then  
39:27 - let's take these three lines and copy that down. 
three more times. And then we'll change Twitter,  
39:40 - to Facebook, Instagram and GitHub. Right. And then 
after that, one last thing is footer. And that's  
40:07 - just going to contain our copyright. So we'll do 
a present copy for the copyright symbol, and then  
40:13 - copy, right? Whatever you current year is, we're 
going to have some basic JavaScript, we're going  
40:22 - to include a script with a source, and the source 
will be j s, main dot j s. Alright, I think that  
40:33 - is it for the markup. So let's look at the Font 
Awesome, we also have to add something here for  
40:38 - that. Alright, so this is Font Awesome website. 
And they recently changed things up a little bit,  
40:43 - you actually have to sign up for a free account. 
So I've already logged in. And I'm just going to  
40:48 - go to my kits. And here's the kit that I have. And 
so what we need to do is to copy this script and  
40:57 - put that into our HTML files. So I'm just going 
to hit copy code. And then we will put that here.  
41:04 - Alright, so I think that is it for the index dot 
HTML. Let's go ahead and save this. And we'll see  
41:11 - what this looks like. So I have have live server 
installed. So if you just right click here,  
41:19 - you can say, open with live server, or you can see 
there's some shortcut here. You can see that that  
41:26 - looks pretty ugly. There's no CSS. So okay, so 
let's start with our SAS going to open the sidebar  
41:34 - by pressing Ctrl V. And then make sure that you're 
in the root and create a folder SCSS. Then within  
41:44 - SCSS, we're going to create a file of main dot s 
CSS. And we're actually going to start with let's  
41:55 - create another file. And we'll name it underscore 
config, dot SCSS. So that's going to be a partial.  
42:02 - And we're actually going to create partials for 
all of our elements. In a large project, that's  
42:09 - what you would do, you would separate everything 
into partials. And this isn't a large project,  
42:14 - but we're going to go through that workflow so 
that you can see it. Let me close the sidebar  
42:18 - here. Ctrl B, in our config, we're going to have 
our variables. So we'll have a primary color. And  
42:26 - that's going to be a dark gray. And then we'll 
have our secondary color. And that will be an  
42:42 - orange. And then we'll put our resets in here. 
So box sizing, border box, margin, zero, and  
42:54 - padding zero, just some standard resets. All 
right, I'm gonna save that in, then we'll go to  
43:01 - our main CSS. And the first thing we need to do is 
import that config. So we'll say import config, we  
43:09 - don't have to put the underscore or the extension. 
Alright, first, let's look at the body. And we're  
43:18 - going to set the background to the primary color. 
And then we'll set the text color. For now we'll  
43:32 - just set that to a white, we're going to come back 
to that in a minute. The height will be 100 Vh. So  
43:41 - 100 view height view, view that as a percentage. 
So basically, it's 100% of the available viewport  
43:49 - height, we're gonna change the font family, like 
the sagoo. And we're going to set the line height  
43:59 - to one. All right, now, we're going to target 
our h1, h2 and h3. And I want the font weights  
44:12 - of those to be a little bit less, more normal 
400. And then we've got some links in here. So  
44:19 - we're going to target all of the links globally. 
And we're going to set the color to white for  
44:29 - now. And the text decoration to none. Right and 
then let's look at our header. So for the header,  
44:46 - we want it to have a position of fixed. We need 
it to always be on top of everything else. So  
44:53 - we're going to set a z index up to a width of 100% 
And padding of one rim. So if you're unfamiliar  
45:05 - with REM and M units, so REM units are based on 
the font size of the body, so the default font  
45:14 - size of the body is 16 pixels. And so one, one rim 
would be one times 16. Two REM would be two times  
45:19 - 16. So that would be 32 pixels. If we change 
the font size of the body to 20 pixels, then  
45:30 - one REM would be 20 pixels and two REM would be 40 
pixels, m m is pretty much the same thing. Except  
45:37 - it's not based on the font size of the body, it's 
based on the font size of the parent. All right,  
45:43 - so now let's go to our z main, target the main 
here, and we'll set a height of 100% and a width  
45:55 - of 100%. And then we'll start doing some nesting. 
Let's target our social icons. For the for those,  
46:07 - I want them to be position fixed with a bottom. 
So from the bottom, one rim, and from the left,  
46:19 - one rim. Within the icons, there are links. So 
let's target those. We want a padding on those  
46:30 - of 0.4 rim and then on hover, we're going 
to change the color, we'll set that to our  
46:44 - secondary color. Lastly, we'll target our footer. 
And we will set the font size on there to one rim.  
47:02 - We're gonna set a fixed position on this as well, 
because we're going to, we want that to be at the  
47:07 - bottom say bottom point forum. Then, right one 
room, do a text align right? Having a one realm  
47:25 - and we'll set the color on that to white for now. 
So before we save this and load it, we actually  
47:32 - have to initialize our sass extension. So we're 
running the live sass compiler extension. So what  
47:40 - we'll do is we'll hit watch sass, if you don't 
have VS code set up, I've got a video with a web  
47:46 - dev setup where we walk through the installation 
of these extensions on the hit watch SAS.  
47:53 - And it opens up an output here, and it's 
watching and it is compiling our CSS every  
48:00 - time that we hit save and automatically updated 
with live server. We go to our files here,  
48:08 - we can see that it created a CSS directory and we 
have our main CSS here. Alright, so that is still  
48:15 - not looking great. Let's look at some CSS that 
is directly applicable to the home page. So what  
48:23 - we're going to do is we're going to create in the 
CSS folder, we're going to create a new partial,  
48:29 - and we'll name it home that SCSS. Alright, and 
so in here, we're going to target our home class.  
48:36 - And we're going to set the height to 100%. Put a 
padding on the top of 40 Vh. So again, let's view  
48:49 - that as a percentage 40% of the available viewport 
height, I'm going to set the overflow to hidden.  
48:56 - We don't want any scroll bars on the homepage, 
it should always fit. We're going to align items  
49:03 - to the center. And we'll do a text align center. 
And then let's set our background. So we're gonna  
49:14 - have that picture that is URL. We need to go up 
one level, so dot dot slash image slash and then  
49:25 - it was modeled dash one dot jpg. And then we're 
going to set a background size to cover. Alright,  
49:36 - let's just save that and see what we have 
so far. Oh, and we have to go back to our  
49:40 - main and we have to import that home. So import 
home. Save. Alright, so I think the images here  
49:52 - it's just let's expand this. Yep. So the image is 
actually there. It's just not positioned properly,  
49:58 - yet. So what we're going to do back in our home 
on the background, we're also going to set some  
50:06 - positioning. So we're going to say center top. 
That's a little bit better. Now the image is too,  
50:14 - too bright, it's too white. So we're going to put 
an overlay on top of it. And there's several ways  
50:19 - to do that, you could use HTML markup, and then 
target that and create an overlay. That way,  
50:25 - you could use pseudo elements. But we're actually 
going to do it right here in the background. So  
50:31 - we're going to add a linear gradient, and then 
we're going to say, We want the gradient to go to  
50:38 - the right. And then we put in our colors, so we're 
going to use RGBA. And then that takes the first  
50:49 - part of it takes your color, so we're going to set 
primary color, really use that variable, and then  
50:58 - we will set this 2.9 opacity. And then we'll do 
another RGBA for the second gradient value, again,  
51:10 - primary color. And we could do point nine again 
and have it the same across, but we're going to  
51:19 - set the right side of it 2.3 then we need a comma 
here. All right, let me save this. There, that  
51:27 - looks a lot better. Make sure that you're still 
within the home class. And now we're going to  
51:32 - target our underscore name. So this is going to be 
the home underscore name. The ampersand remember,  
51:43 - and present always refers to the parent. So it's 
the same as typing dot home underscore name. Okay,  
51:50 - so in here, we're gonna set our font size to five 
rim, we'll set the padding on the bottom to one  
52:00 - rim margin on top of one rim. And we're going to 
set a border on the bottom. And we'll set that to  
52:13 - two pixels solid. And for now, we're going to 
set this to white. And then within that name,  
52:21 - remember, we have a span that goes around the last 
name. And so that was present, which is going to  
52:31 - be the same as dot home underscore name, dash dash 
last. And we're going to set the color on here to  
52:42 - the secondary color. And the font weights, we're 
gonna increase that one up to 700. All right,  
52:52 - let's save this. Now it's looking pretty good. 
Alright, so when we're hovering over these icons,  
53:00 - the color just kind of pops right in. So I'm 
going to add a bit of a transition to that.  
53:06 - So back in our config, let's add a mixin. So 
at symbol mixin, we'll name this transition  
53:17 - ease. In then we will set a transition. It will 
set all point O five seconds, is in out. Okay,  
53:35 - so normally on transition, I would target what 
we're trying to transition is the color is the  
53:41 - position, what is it? Here, we want to reuse this. 
So when I include this mixin, I want it to target  
53:47 - any transition that it can set it to a point five 
or half a second ease in and out. Alright, so let  
53:54 - me save this. Let's go to our main. And we had a 
hover in our social icons right here. Alright, and  
54:02 - so let's add the transition on the link. So we'll 
do to include the mixin we do include, and then  
54:12 - the Nixon name, transition ease. Great, let's save 
this. And let's hover over them. You see that it's  
54:20 - slowly changing the color is now let's look here 
at our colors, we have it set to white, but in our  
54:29 - config, we have the ability to change the primary 
and secondary color. So if we change the primary  
54:35 - color to white, then you won't be able to see the 
text. So what we're going to do in our config is  
54:40 - we're going to create a function that is going 
to give us an appropriate color for our text. So  
54:46 - to create a function, we'll do add function. And 
this is a lot like a JavaScript function if you're  
54:53 - familiar with JavaScript, so we're going to set 
this to set text color We're going to pass it a  
55:01 - variable of color. And then we're going to use an 
if statement. So we're going to say at symbol if,  
55:10 - and then lightness, we're going to evaluate the 
lightness of the color that we're passing it. So  
55:18 - if the lightness is greater than 40%, then 
we're going to return we'll just we'll set  
55:32 - this to black. Alright, so if the lightness is 
greater than 40%, so it means it's a light color,  
55:38 - then we want to return a dark color, so black, 
and then we'll do else. So if it is a dark color,  
55:51 - we want to return white. Right, so now we can 
use this function, instead of declaring the  
56:02 - color. Go back to our main here. So instead of 
white, we're going to call set, text color. And  
56:11 - then we're going to pass it our primary color. 
So it's going to evaluate this primary color,  
56:18 - which is dark. And it's going to return us the 
white value. So anywhere else that we have the  
56:25 - color set, we can swap that out. So say set text 
color, primary color. Let's see, did we set that  
56:36 - anywhere else? I think there was one other spots. 
Yep, on the footer. So set text color. Primary,  
56:48 - there we go. We'll save that. Nothing's going to 
change obviously. In, up, so we also had it here  
56:59 - on our border. So this line that goes across in 
the middle here, we're going to set that as well  
57:05 - set text color primary. I think we're good there. 
Okay, so everything is looking pretty good, except  
57:13 - for our menu, of course. So let's start to let's 
let's get to work on our menu. So let me open up  
57:19 - the sidebar here. And we're going to create a new 
partial. So underscore menu, dot SCSS. And close  
57:29 - the sidebar. And let's see, first we'll target 
the menu button. We're going to set that to a  
57:36 - position of absolute. Set the Z index here to one, 
right, one room and top one room. Okay, so we're  
57:52 - going to absolutely position this. So we want this 
in the top right corner, we'll set the height to  
57:58 - 20 pixels, and the width to 28 pixels. And when 
we hover over this, we want a cursor pointer. And  
58:10 - we're going to include our transition mixin. So 
include transition is because we're going to be  
58:18 - adding some transition animation to this. Alright, 
so within the menu button, we have our menu button  
58:27 - burger, so we can do ampersand underscore burger. 
And this one, we will again position absolute  
58:42 - we're going to say that this one would be right 
zero, and top is going to be point five rim the  
58:54 - width of 28 pixels. Height of three pixels in the 
background will be our set text color. And that's  
59:10 - going to be our primary color. And again, we're 
going to include on this one, our ease transition.  
59:19 - Alright, so let's save this and see what we have. 
And actually we have to remember back in our main,  
59:26 - we have to include this. So import that was menu. 
Right and so now we have a line. So that's just  
59:41 - one line in so again, let's look at the HTML. 
So the menu button is basically a wrapper,  
59:51 - and we're using this we're going to be using this 
as our click event. Within the menu button. We're  
59:58 - going to have our bars For the hamburger, we just 
configured the middle bar. And so we set it to 28  
60:09 - pixels wide, three pixels high, and the background 
color is going to be the text color, which is  
60:13 - going to be white. And so now what we're going to 
do to create the other two bars is we're going to  
60:21 - use pseudo elements. So within the burger, so 
we're going to use ampersand before. And with  
60:31 - a pseudo element, we have our content, we'll set 
that to nothing. We have a position of absolute  
60:40 - is that the top two negative eight pixels, so we 
want it to move up eight pixels from its initial  
60:49 - position. And the width will be 28 pixels. Height 
of three pixels. Background color will be the set  
61:06 - text color. And we're going to also include or 
ease transition. Okay, and now let's save that.  
61:20 - And now we have our top bar. Right. And so now to 
add the bottom bar, we're within the burger class  
61:29 - still. So we're going to use ampersand after. 
And we're basically going going to do the same  
61:39 - thing. So I'm just going to copy this. And then 
instead of eight pixels up, we want to go eight  
61:46 - pixels down. And I want the bottom bar to be not 
the same width. So set that to 20. All right,  
61:53 - and then let's save that. There we go. So now we 
have our menu button. Okay, so now on the menu  
62:00 - button, we're going to have it animate a bit. So 
again, still within the burger through JavaScript,  
62:07 - we're going to assign it an open class. So 
when the open class gets applied to the menu,  
62:16 - we want it to transform. And we're going to 
rotate 720 degrees. And then we're going to  
62:27 - set background to transparent. Let's save this 
for now. And we'll come back to it. Let's go  
62:39 - ahead and look at the JavaScript. So let me open 
up the sidebar. And in our distribution folder,  
62:47 - let's create another folder named j s. 
And then within j s, let's create a file,  
62:52 - rename that main dot j s. Alright, and close. 
The sidebar, we'll start by targeting are DOM  
63:00 - elements. So we'll set some constants here, we're 
going to set the menu button. We'll use document  
63:10 - dot query selector. And then here we can query 
by tag or by ID, or by class. So was we'll use  
63:22 - class here and menu button was the class. 
Right, and we'll create another constant of  
63:30 - hamburger. So the menu button again, that's the 
basically the wrapper, and then the hamburger is  
63:41 - our span. So we'll do document query selector. 
And that was menu menu button for burger. Okay,  
63:58 - so then we're going to create a variable called 
show menu, we're going to set that to false. So  
64:05 - initially, the menu is not shown. Then we will add 
an event listener to the menu button. We're going  
64:17 - to listen for the click event. And then we will 
toggle menu we'll call this function that we're  
64:27 - going to create here. So we're going to create a 
function called toggle menu. And so we'll start by  
64:37 - saying if not show menu. So the exclamation is a 
NOT operator. So if show menu is false, then we're  
64:50 - going to get that hamburger class and we're going 
to target the class list and we're going to add  
64:59 - Open. So we're going to say that it's now open, 
then we'll need to set our show menu to true. So  
65:14 - now we know that the menu is open, and then we'll 
put our else statement. So if the menu is open,  
65:20 - we want to do the opposite, right? So hamburger, 
class list, remove, open. So just the opposite.  
65:32 - And then we're also going to want to set our show 
menu, back to false. Alright, so that's it for the  
65:40 - JavaScript for now, add a few more lines in a 
minute. But let's save this and let's see what  
65:45 - it does. So there we go, it rotates and the middle 
line becomes transparent. So if I click it again,  
65:55 - it should go back to normal. There we go. So 
that is the first part. So the goal is to make  
66:06 - that turn into an X. So now what we'll do here is 
in our open class, we're now going to target our  
66:16 - pseudo elements. So we'll do ampersand before. 
So this is targeting that top, that top bar,  
66:25 - and we're going to set the Transform, rotate to 45 
degrees. And we're also going to add a translate,  
66:38 - translate moves it in the first value is going to 
be your x or your horizontal position. So we want  
66:47 - to move it five pixels over. And then the second 
value is your y or your vertical. So we want to  
66:54 - move it down eight pixels. Alright, let's just 
let's save that and see what we have so far. There  
67:02 - we go. That's part of our x right there. Okay, so 
now let's target our after. So and present. After  
67:13 - that's going to be the bottom line. Now 
remember, the bottom line was a bit shorter,  
67:17 - so we need to actually change that. So we'll say 
width 28 pixels make it the same as the top now.  
67:23 - And then we will add our transform with a rotate 
of this time will be a negative 45 degrees to make  
67:34 - that other side of the x. And then we will 
translate this one to three pixels over and  
67:42 - negative seven pixels. So move it up a bit. And 
I had to play around with these numbers to get  
67:48 - it to work just right, but this is what I came up 
with. So let's save that. And now when I click it,  
67:54 - we should have an x There we go. Alright, pretty 
cool. Okay, so now we want to show the menu.  
68:06 - Alright, so for the menu, let's target the nav. 
And on that we want the position to be fixed in  
68:16 - the top of zero, and a left of zero width of 100 
view width. So with with view width is the same as  
68:29 - view height. So 100 would be like saying 100% of 
the available viewport width, we're going to set  
68:36 - the opacity to point nine, eight. So just want to 
see a little bit behind it. And initially we're  
68:43 - going to set the visibility to hidden. Okay, so 
within the nav, we're going to do the same thing  
68:49 - in JavaScript and we're going to add a class to 
it. So it's gonna be the same thing. We're going  
68:53 - to do the ampersand, so it's mean nav dot open. 
And then if it is open, we want to change the  
69:02 - visibility to visible still within the nav, let's 
target our menu nav. Right and then then the main  
69:15 - menu nav, we have our menu items the home about me 
my projects contact me. So we're going to display  
69:21 - those as flex. And then we're going to see if 
flex flow we'll set that to column. And then  
69:32 - if for some reason we have a weird device height, 
we'll set this to wrap. We're going to align items  
69:43 - center, justify content center. We want the height 
to be 100 view height overflow hidden. We don't  
69:53 - want any scroll bars ever on our menu. We're gonna 
set the background to the primary color will do  
70:01 - the list style. So let's get rid of those. Those 
bullet points, let's do a padding on the right to  
70:14 - see one rim, and then we'll do a transform 
and translate actually rindu translate y,  
70:22 - we'll set this to a negative 100%. And we're 
going to include our ease mixin. Alright,  
70:31 - so what this is doing, if you're not familiar with 
Flexbox, I have a video on that as well and check  
70:37 - it out at my channel. So what we're going to do 
on the menu is we have it, translate y, so that is  
70:43 - going to be your vertical, and we have it set to 
a negative 100%. So that means the position of the  
70:49 - menu is going to start off the page at the top. 
And when we click the button, we want it to come  
70:55 - in from the top. So what we'll do here is within 
our menu nav, when the menu nav gets assigned the  
71:05 - open class, then we want to transform, translate 
y to zero, so the initial position, and we're  
71:18 - going to need to go into our JavaScript and add 
some more lines here. So we need to also target  
71:23 - our nav. So that is going to be document, query 
selector. And then we will also need our menu nav,  
71:41 - which is the UL, that was menu. Alright, so we 
have those. And so now we're going to do the same  
72:00 - thing in here. We'll take our nav, class list, 
add, open. And then our menu nav, class list,  
72:16 - add, open. Alright, so I'm just going to 
take these, copy them down here, and we're  
72:24 - going to change add to remove Ctrl D to select 
multiple of the same. So if I highlight, remove,  
72:33 - I can control D and select all three of them have 
three cursors. That's a good, good little shortcut  
72:39 - to learn. That's it for the JavaScript for now. 
Let's save that. And let's see what we have. So  
72:45 - now you see that the menu items are gone. So now 
when we click on this, there we go. Now we need  
72:53 - to format our actual links here. So let's go back 
to our menu sets. Okay, so still within our menu,  
73:05 - now, we're going to see it was menu nav underscore 
item. So we're going to target each item,  
73:15 - the menu itself is coming down from the top, we 
want the menu items to come in from the right,  
73:23 - so we're going to transform translate x this time, 
so x is your horizontal, and the initial value is  
73:33 - going to be 100 view width. So we want the links 
to be all the way off the right side of the page,  
73:40 - we're going to include our transition mixin. And 
then in JavaScript, we're going to add the open  
73:54 - class just like we did on the others. And when 
it's open, we want to transform translate x to  
74:04 - the initial position, so that we'll bring them in 
from the right, we're also going to add an active  
74:11 - class to our menu items. And then we're going to 
target the a the link within and we want to set  
74:21 - the color on that to the secondary, the secondary 
color. And so that's just going to highlight  
74:28 - which page you're currently on. And then in the 
JavaScript, we have a couple more lines to add.  
74:36 - Alright, we're going to add a constant here of 
nav items. And we're do documents and we can't do  
74:46 - query selector because that selects one element. 
So we're going to use query selector all and we're  
74:52 - going to get an array of elements here. And that 
is menu nav item Right, and so then down here, we  
75:04 - need to add that or we need to add that open class 
to these. So what we'll do is we'll do nav items.  
75:11 - And we'll use a high order array function will 
do for each, we're going to use an arrow function  
75:17 - here. So we're going to loop through the items, 
and we're going to pull each time we're going to  
75:25 - pull one item out. And so in the function, we'll 
say item dot class list, dot add, open. Alright,  
75:39 - so we'll do the same thing down here. Except 
instead of adding, we're going to remove, right,  
75:51 - and that should be everything for the JavaScript. 
Now there's nothing else that we're going to add  
75:55 - in here. So let's see what that does now. All 
right, they came in, if you can barely see it,  
76:03 - they come in pretty quickly from the right, but 
at the same time, that the menu is coming down,  
76:09 - so it's not very noticeable. So let's add some 
more sass to our menu. Alright, so now make sure  
76:18 - that you are within the menu nav still. Right, and 
we're going to use ampersand links is going to be  
76:29 - a menu nav link, we want to display these inline 
block, we're going to do a font size of two REM  
76:45 - text transform to uppercase. padding, top 
and bottom of two REM zero left and right  
76:56 - font weights of 300. And we're going to include 
our ease transition. And then on hover roids do  
77:12 - a color of secondary color. Right, let's 
save that. Let's see what we have now.  
77:21 - It looks pretty good. But see they're coming in 
all at the same time. And a coming in too quickly.  
77:26 - It's going to our menu sass. And then all the way 
at the bottom, we're going to include a for loop.  
77:34 - So very similar to JavaScript. If you're familiar 
with that at four, then we're going to declare  
77:40 - a variable of I. And we're going to say from one 
through four, because we have four links. Alright,  
77:51 - so now we're going to target our menu, menu nav, 
item, and we're going to target the nth child. And  
78:03 - we can't just put the variable in here you see 
how it's highlighting red, it's telling us that  
78:10 - you can't do that within a function. So we need 
to wrap this with dollar sign curly braces. So  
78:21 - now we've targeted the nth child. So this is going 
to iterate through the links. So the initial one  
78:28 - is going to target the first link, then it's going 
to count up one. So that would be the second week,  
78:33 - the third link the fourth link. So on each link, 
we're going to do a transition delay. And in here,  
78:42 - we can use the variable as it is. So we're going 
to do the variable times 0.1 seconds. And then  
78:52 - we're going to add to that 0.15 seconds. And this 
is a complicated formula formula, but it's what I  
79:00 - came up with. Alright, so it's going to iterate 
through each one, and it's going to add a delay  
79:05 - to each one so they should stagger in. Alright, 
let's save that. And now let's see what we have.  
79:12 - There we go. Alright, so let's look something 
is a little bit off here. Let me go. Yeah, okay,  
79:23 - actually here in the home menu, the margin bottom, 
or the margin should be margin bottom. On the name  
79:32 - that's a little bit off right there. So let's 
save that. There we go. That looks much better.  
79:37 - So that's gonna be it for the homepage. So now 
let's look at the about page. So let me open the  
79:44 - sidebar here. And in the distribution folder, we 
want to add a file about the HTML. And let's go  
79:55 - ahead and add the sass file for that as well. 
We'll add the partial underscore About SCSS,  
80:01 - close the sidebar, let me close some of these, we 
don't need the JavaScript anymore. We shouldn't  
80:11 - need the menu. Alright, so let's start with the 
HTML markup, we're just going to begin with the  
80:16 - index dot HTML. We'll copy everything from there, 
paste it into about. And let's say about Mike  
80:26 - Smith. All right, the menu then now let's take the 
active off of the home. And we'll put it on the  
80:35 - about. And then let's look at our section here. 
Let's change this to about, then this first part  
80:47 - of the section here, let's delete. And we'll add 
a div about bio image. And then within here, we'll  
81:00 - have an h2 with the class of text, secondary. And 
we'll say bio. So we're going to add a class here,  
81:13 - text secondary. So this will be a reusable class, 
anything that we put it on will have the secondary  
81:18 - color. So let's go ahead and do that go to our 
main sass file. And we'll just put it right here.  
81:25 - Text secondary. And this is just going to change 
the color to the secondary color. Right, and let's  
81:37 - go ahead while we're in here, let's add our about 
sass partial. written here, let's add a paragraph  
81:46 - and we'll add some Lorem in here. 30. Now under 
this, we're gonna have some jobs almost like a  
81:55 - small resume, we'll add a div with the class of 
jobs. Another div jobs. Job. So each job. So the  
82:11 - first one, I will say we'll put an h2, the class 
of text secondary. And let's say 2017 to current,  
82:24 - and then we'll do it h. h three will say that he 
works for Google. And then an H six is position,  
82:35 - full stack developer, and then we'll add a 
paragraph with some more Lorem. I'll put 20  
82:44 - on there. Let's take this job here. And let's 
duplicate it two more times. So Alt Shift down,  
82:51 - one, two. All right, so let's change this 
one, to 2015 to 2017. And let's say that was  
83:04 - Microsoft. And let's see, front end developer. 
And the last one here, we'll say 2012. To 2015.  
83:23 - We'll just make something up web design Co. 
And we'll say graphic designer. All right,  
83:38 - then everything else we want the social icons, 
we want the footer, everything else is the same.  
83:45 - Okay, so let's got all that. Yep, let's save 
this. Let's go into our sass file. Alright,  
83:53 - we'll start with our about class. Let's add a 
padding on here to the bottom, we'll add to rim  
84:03 - and then within here we have our about bio image. 
Here we'll set the height to 50 view height,  
84:16 - the width will be 100%. And then we're going 
to do the same thing with background that we  
84:23 - did in the home page here. So I'm going to copy 
this and paste that there. I think then on here,  
84:35 - we'll have a will display as flex. And we'll set 
the flex direction to column, align items center  
84:48 - and then justify content we're going to use flex 
and K now still within our about let's target the  
84:57 - paragraph. That's the bio paragraph We'll set a 
margin. On the bottom there have to ram. Right,  
85:06 - let's just see what we have so far. We'll 
save that. All right, we'll go to about me,  
85:13 - it's already looking pretty good. So we set 
the view height to 50%. We've got the image  
85:19 - back there with the overlay, we've got the title 
here, and the paragraph displaying is flex, set  
85:25 - it to a column. And so that we can align center 
and then flex to the end. We still got a bit more  
85:33 - to do here, we put that this, why does that say 
block end, margin bottom. Alright, so we put this  
85:43 - two rim margin on the bottom, so it wouldn't go 
all the way to the, to the edge. Actually, here,  
85:49 - this paragraph should have been here, so we have 
to be careful with nesting. nesting too much can  
85:56 - become an issue. Didn't want to target all the 
paragraphs. So actually miss something here,  
86:06 - we forgot to wrap this, we needed to wrap this 
in in about bio. Alright, so now let's target  
86:19 - or I'm still within the about, we'll start at the 
about veyo. We'll set the width here to 80%. And  
86:28 - then text align, center. And then I want to target 
the text secondary. So that's the heading, I could  
86:41 - just target the heading directly. There's many 
different ways of doing things. But we're just  
86:47 - targeting the text secondary, and I want to add a 
padding on that on the bottom of one rim. Alright,  
86:54 - let's check that out. There. That's looking good. 
Alright, so now let's style our jobs. So still,  
87:02 - within about we'll go to jobs. And then within 
there, let's set the width to 60 view width. So  
87:13 - 60% of the view width of set a margin on here of 
two rim top, auto right, zero on the bottom on the  
87:22 - left, we're going to display this as grid, we'll 
set the grid template columns to initially one  
87:34 - fractional unit, and then the grid gap will set 
to two. So if you're not familiar with CSS Grid,  
87:45 - I have a video on that as well check that out in 
my channel. Alright, let's see what we have so  
87:50 - far. All right, looking better. Now within jobs. 
We have jobs job. So each job we're going to have  
88:03 - a background. And we're going to lights and so 
we're going to use the primary color. And we're  
88:12 - going to lighten it by 10%. And then we want a 
padding, we'll add point five REM all around,  
88:21 - and then a border bottom we'll do five pixels, 
solid and secondary color. Alright, that's  
88:33 - looking good. Um, everything's a little squished 
together. So within the job here, let's just go  
88:40 - ahead and target the headings directly, we'll say 
h two and H three. We'll set those to a margin,  
88:50 - top and bottom of point five rim and zero left and 
right. On the H six. I'm going to set the top and  
89:02 - bottom a little bit less. So let's go point three, 
zero and left and right. There we go. That looks  
89:11 - pretty good. Alright, so now notice, the social 
icons and the copyright are getting in the way a  
89:20 - bit. All right, so let's go down here still within 
about let's target our social icons. And this time  
89:30 - we were going to display these as flex and we want 
to set the flex direction to column. Alright, so  
89:43 - now they're out of the way that looks good. And we 
need to do something with the footer now. So let's  
89:51 - target the footer and we're going to transform 
will Start by rotating it, and we're going to  
90:02 - rotate it 90 degrees. And we're going to translate 
or move it. The X value will be a negative three,  
90:14 - rim and the y value will be a negative five 
rounds, I had to play around with these numbers  
90:20 - as well. So there you go, we flipped, flipped it 
up and put it on its side. Now it's out of the  
90:27 - way as well. All right, so that is it for this 
page, we'll get into the responsiveness once  
90:35 - we're finished with all of our pages. Alright, so 
now let's move on to our projects page. So let me  
90:41 - open the sidebar. And in this, let's add another 
file. And this is going to be projects dot html.  
90:50 - And then let's go ahead and add our sass file 
as well, the partial underscore projects,  
90:58 - dot SCSS. Alright, close the sidebar. And now, 
what we'll do here is let's just use the about  
91:08 - let's copy everything from there into projects, 
and then we'll modify it. Alright, so we'll say  
91:18 - Mike Smith projects. And let's take the active 
here, and let's put it on the projects link.  
91:31 - Alright, so let's rename this to projects. And I'm 
actually going to have the image in here as well.  
91:39 - So let's rename this to projects, bio image. And 
then within the bio image, I will delete this will  
91:51 - add an h1 with a text, secondary class, and we'll 
say my projects. Alright, and then let's get rid  
92:04 - of the jobs here. Alright, so now here, let's put 
a div with the class of projects. items should be  
92:22 - projects, projects, items, and then projects, item 
items and then item, this time we're going to use  
92:38 - an image. And the source is going to be image 
and then project one. For the alt, so I'll just  
92:50 - put my projects right under this, we're going to 
have a div with the class of projects, projects,  
93:02 - buttons. Alright, so we're gonna have an overlay 
over these, and there's going to be some buttons  
93:09 - within the overlay. So in here, let's add a link, 
the class of projects button. And that's just not  
93:22 - that's not going to go anywhere. And then we'll 
put an icon here. And it's going to be FA s, fa,  
93:30 - I, oops, not gas, fa s. Alright, and then after 
that, let's say, preview, right, and then let's  
93:44 - take this link, and we're going to Alt Shift 
Down Arrow, copy it, we want two links here.  
93:51 - This one is going to be instead of I it's going 
to be GitHub. And actually he says as a brand,  
94:00 - we have to change it to FA B for brand. And let's 
change this to GitHub. Alright, so that is one  
94:11 - project. So let's highlight this and we're going 
to duplicate it, we have six total projects. So  
94:18 - we're going to duplicate it five times. I'll Shift 
Down Arrow 12345. Alright, let's go back up to the  
94:25 - first one. Right, here's the first one. And all 
we're going to change on these is the the project  
94:33 - image. Everything else will stay the same. So 2345 
and six, right and then everything after that the  
94:50 - social icons, the footer, everything else will be 
the same. So let's save this. Let's go ahead and  
94:58 - check that out. It's going to look up Yeah, okay, 
can't really tell what's going on there. So let's  
95:05 - go to our sass. And the sass here is going to 
be pretty close to what's in the about CSS flow  
95:12 - for the most part, the top part anyway, so let's 
just copy this and we'll make some adjustments.  
95:18 - Alright, so this is going to be projects. 
padding bottom to ram is good image. This time,  
95:28 - I want it to be 30, view height, background, all 
of that's good. Flex columns, center flex, and all  
95:39 - of that's good. So here's where things will change 
up a bit, we'll take the paragraph out where to  
95:45 - target the text secondary, and want the font size 
to be a bit bigger, set it to two rim and I want  
95:55 - the margin on the bottom to run. Alright, and 
then we don't need this. Alright, so here, um, a  
96:10 - lot of this is the same. So we'll change jobs to 
projects, items. So that's the wrapper. Or it's  
96:25 - let's take the, let's take this part out. And 
then we also have projects item. So on the item,  
96:37 - we're going to set the position to be relative, 
because we're going to need to absolutely position  
96:47 - other items, we're going to set the border bottom 
to five pixels solid, and the secondary color. We  
97:02 - want the overflow to be hidden. We'll talk about 
that in a minute. cursor pointer. Now within here  
97:11 - we have the image. And we want the width on 
those to be 100%. Right now they're way off  
97:18 - the page. Alright, let's, let's stop there. And 
let's see what we have. Well, I keep forgetting  
97:30 - in our main sass, we need to import that. 
So let's import our projects. Save. Oh, that  
97:38 - looks much better. Alright, let's get back over 
here to our sass file. So that's looking, okay,  
97:44 - we're going to do something with these buttons. 
Now. Let's go in here, and we're going to create  
97:50 - an overlay. This time, we're going to use a 
pseudo element. So we're going to use this is the  
97:57 - project's item. And then we'll create an after we 
have our content, we'll set that to blank position  
98:08 - here is going to be absolute. That's why we have 
the parent container set to relative. Alright,  
98:14 - we're going to initially set the top at 100%. So 
that is going to push it all the way to the bottom  
98:20 - initially is going to be under its element. And 
so that's the reason why we set the overflow to  
98:27 - hidden that way we don't see it, because when we 
hover we want it to pull up from the bottom right,  
98:33 - we're gonna set left to zero, set the height to 
100% and the width to 100%. We're gonna set the  
98:45 - background to the secondary color, and opacity 
initially, initially is going to be zero. And  
98:55 - let's include our transition. Alright, that's 
looking good. No, that's really not going to do  
99:04 - anything. And we'll save it, you'll see, it really 
looks the same because that item is hidden. So  
99:11 - let's create a hover event here. So this is going 
to be the item and present, hover. And what we're  
99:21 - going to do is on hover, we need to target the 
pseudo element. So that's going to be after we  
99:29 - want the top to be zero instead of 100%. So that's 
going to put it back where it should go. And the  
99:36 - opacity want to set it 2.09 I just want to barely 
see through it. All right, so let's save that. Now  
99:47 - if we hover over it, there we go. It comes up from 
the bottom and becomes visible. Alright, so now we  
99:56 - still have these buttons to deal with. Okay, so 
this so we're still in the Item. All right. And  
100:02 - what we need is projects buttons. So projects is 
the main. So we're going to have to come down here  
100:11 - and make sure that we're not under the item we're 
under the projects. So ampersand buttons, here,  
100:21 - we're going to set a position of absolute. On the 
top is going to be zero, height of 100%, width of  
100:35 - 100%. We set a z index of one, we're going to 
display these as a grid. So let's do our grid,  
100:46 - template columns. And these will also always be 
in a two column layout. So we want the preview to  
100:54 - be on the left and GitHub to be on the right. 
So we're going to use repeat, we're going to  
100:59 - say repeat twice, one fractional unit. So that 
will make them equal. And we're going to align  
101:06 - items to the center, and text align, center. Okay, 
let's save that. And now they're there. But I only  
101:19 - want them to pop up when I hover. Let's target the 
individual buttons now. So projects button. Here,  
101:30 - we're going to set the opacity to zero 
initially, set the color to the set text, oops,  
101:39 - set text color. Based on the secondary, we want 
to base it off of the secondary because that's  
101:52 - what's going to be behind it. Right, and then 
let's include our transition. And now we need a  
102:00 - hover. So can present hover. On hover, I want the 
text color change. So we're going to say color.  
102:09 - And let's see, we can do can do this. On orange, 
I think that's going to return a white. But when  
102:20 - I hover over, I wanted to change the black just 
to show that that I'm hovering over it. And so  
102:27 - I want it to be the opposite. So I know that this 
is white. So I can kind of a hack. But I can do,  
102:36 - I can wrap that in another set text color. So 
that's going to set the text color against white,  
102:46 - which is going to be black. Now what we need 
to do is I want the button to display when I  
102:53 - hover over the project item. So in order to do 
that, I have to go to the project item here. And  
103:00 - we'll go to our hover event. And after the pseudo 
element, we'll do projects button, and then we'll  
103:12 - change the opacity to one. All right, let's save 
that. Let's see what we have. Okay, the hovers not  
103:21 - working. Why is this set to column ruled? color? 
Sorry about that. All right, let's see. Okay,  
103:34 - it was opposite. Alright. So initially, this is 
black. We want to hover over to changes to white.  
103:41 - For the social icons in the footer, they're great. 
We're going to leave them just like that. All  
103:55 - right, that's all looking good. So now let's look 
at the contacts page. We pull out the sidebar,  
104:03 - and under dist. Let's create contact dot html. 
Let's go ahead and create our sass partial  
104:12 - underscore contact.sc s s. Right, let's go ahead 
and in the main let's go ahead and add that before  
104:24 - I forget. And that was contact. Alright, let's 
just let's use the project's HTML Copy that. We'll  
104:36 - paste that in the contact and we'll say contact 
Mike Smith. Alright, and then let's change our  
104:54 - active here to our Contact link. Change or section 
class to contact, and then everything within here,  
105:07 - we can go ahead and remove. So we're going to 
add an h2 and we're just going to say contact  
105:17 - me. Alright, then let's add a div with the class 
of contact list. And then we'll add a div with  
105:30 - the class of contact, contact email. Within here, 
we'll have an icon, fa, S, fa envelope. And then  
105:46 - we'll just say email there. And then we'll have a 
div with a class of text secondary. Within here,  
105:56 - we'll put the email so we'll just say email, 
at email. com. Alright, so let's copy this down  
106:05 - twice. Alright, and so we have an email, we also 
have phone. And that's going to be mobile, Alt,  
106:16 - C phone, and this will just put a number in here. 
There we go. And then this last one is going to be  
106:32 - address. And for that, we'll use the icon, marker, 
Alt, to say, we'll say address, and then just put  
106:47 - a generic address 123 First Street, Houston, 
Texas. All right. Everything else past here,  
106:59 - we're going to keep the same. Right, let's save 
that. Let's go to the contact page is going to be  
107:07 - ugly. There we go. Alright, so let's go to our 
contact CSS. So from here, this one's going to be  
107:14 - a lot like home. So let's just copy all of this 
from home. into here. change this to contact.  
107:25 - Alright, so we're going to have a view height 
of 100% padding on the top 40 view height. Okay,  
107:34 - so here, we're going to change this, we're going 
to display this as flex. And we're going to set  
107:42 - the flex direction to column background is good, 
we're going to use that same thing. Alright. And  
107:51 - so then everything up to this, we can take that 
out. So here, we're going to target the h2. And  
108:00 - we're going to set the font size to three, REM 
and margin, bottom to REM. And then we're going  
108:11 - to target the contact contact list. We're going 
to display this as grid. So get our grid template  
108:24 - columns. And initially it's going to be set to 
one fractional unit. We want a grid gap to run  
108:34 - and we're gonna change the font oops, and change 
the font size to 1.5 rim. Right and then yeah,  
108:45 - let's let's save that. See what we have. 
Alright, that's looking. Okay, so far. Let's see,  
108:52 - I think goodness something here. Flex column. 
Yeah, we need to align items center. There we  
109:02 - go. So that is all of the pages. Let's go through. 
We've got our main page here. And then our about  
109:12 - me. And projects looking good. All right, and 
then the contact. Actually, you know what I want  
109:28 - to do on the contact, I want to change the social 
icons, I want them to be up here. So right here,  
109:38 - let's do social icons. Let's change the position 
to initial and we'll set a margin top on there  
109:49 - have to rim. Yeah, I like that better. It's all 
in the same spot to contact. Next we'll make this  
109:57 - responsive. Alright, let's see what this looks 
like. Before we make any responsive changes,  
110:03 - actually doesn't look terrible. But obviously, we 
don't want to have this menu. When we're at this  
110:14 - size. Let's see the other pages. That actually 
doesn't look terrible either. But we'll make a few  
110:24 - changes here, maybe make this text bigger. Let's 
check out projects. Oh, yeah, that's, that's too  
110:31 - big. You know, we'll need to adjust that grid. 
And then we'll make these inline instead of  
110:41 - stacked. Alright. So the first thing that we need 
to do is we'll go to our config in our sass file,  
110:54 - and we will go and then at the bottom, we're going 
to include some mixins. So mixin. And we're going  
111:03 - to create a mixin for for some media queries. 
So we'll start with a medium size. And so we're  
111:11 - going to include in this mixin, a media screen. 
And we'll put a minimum width of 768. And then  
111:26 - in here, we will put at content. So now when we 
call this mixin, whatever content will be will get  
111:34 - passed into this media query. All right, so that's 
for the medium size, let's go ahead and just copy  
111:39 - this down, Alt Shift down, we're going to create 
two more. So we're going to create a large,  
111:47 - that is going to be 1024 pixels. And then we're 
going to create an extra large, and that will be  
111:54 - anything over 1600 pixels. Alright, and let's 
save this. And let's start with, let's just go  
112:03 - back to the homepage here. So what we're going to 
do is, we're going to create a new sass file. I'm  
112:13 - going to name it underscore responsive, dot SCSS. 
Alright, and then let's go to our main s CSS, and  
112:27 - let's include that. There we go. Save that. Now in 
our responsive, we're going to include our media  
112:41 - queries, those mixins. So we're going to include 
media medium, we'll start with the smaller,  
112:48 - smaller sizes and work our way up. So let's start 
with the menu. So menu button. At this size,  
112:58 - we want the visibility to be hidden, and then our 
nav. We want the visibility of this to be visible.  
113:08 - And then within the nav, we have our menu nav. And 
we need to make some alterations, because we don't  
113:19 - want the full page now to come up, we want a nav 
bar at the top. So let's change this display here  
113:25 - to block by default, it's fixed. And then we're 
going to transform and translate. Why? Because  
113:36 - we had that all the way at the top. So now we need 
to put it back in its place. And then let's set a  
113:43 - height here. To 100% that is available to it. Set 
the background currently it has the the dark gray  
113:53 - background, the primary color, so we're going to 
set that to transparent. And then we're going to  
113:59 - text the line to the right. Then within here we 
have our items. So that is menu nav item. And  
114:09 - we need to display these in line. Right and then 
we're gonna add a padding on the right of 1.5 rim.  
114:21 - Then we need to target the menu link. Then on the 
link, we're going to change the font size because  
114:32 - we we made it bigger earlier. So by default, I 
think it was three REM so we're going to change  
114:37 - it to 1.5 REM let's see what we have so far. We'll 
save that. Alright, now let's check it out. So  
114:44 - we get over 768 Here we go. Nice. That looks 
good. All right. Let's See what we need to do  
115:00 - on the about page? I think we'll just make this 
text a little bit bigger as we go. Yeah. Okay,  
115:14 - so outside of. So we're still inside the media, 
the medium media query are outside of the nav. So  
115:23 - we're going to add and about bio. And then let's 
change the font size to 1.5. REM, make it just a  
115:35 - little bit bigger. All right, let's see. That 
looks good. Yep. All right. Let's look at the  
115:48 - projects. So it's one column they're in, then 
yeah, we're gonna want to change that. So let's  
116:00 - target projects. And then within the projects, I 
think it was the bio image. Yeah, the heights on  
116:12 - there? Because let's see when we get. Yeah, let's 
get a little too close, I think. So let's change  
116:20 - the height. So I think it was 50 initially, 
so let's go 40 view height. And then projects,  
116:33 - items. Let's change the grid template columns. And 
we're going to change that to a repeat to have one  
116:46 - fractional unit. Right? And then this, my projects 
would probably need to increase that a bit. So  
116:54 - that was, so we could target the text secondary. 
I will change the font size there to three REM.  
117:05 - Right. Let's save that and see what we have. Now 
that's that looks good. Right. don't think there's  
117:20 - anything? Let's see. Let's go to contacts. Yeah, 
so let's, let's make this to let's add contacts,  
117:32 - contact lists. And what the grid template columns, 
and we'll do the repeats to one of our on that  
117:46 - one as well. All right, let's see. Yeah, that's 
good. All right. So that is on medium screens.  
118:02 - So let's move on to the large screens, a couple of 
things that we're going to change here. So let's  
118:08 - include that mix in media query. So include 
media, large, I think projects. Yeah, let's,  
118:20 - let's make projects, let's turn projects into a 
three column at a large layout. So let's see where  
118:29 - was that? We could take this. paste it here. Get 
rid of the bio image and close that out and change  
118:46 - this to a three. That should work. Let's say that. 
All right, medium size to large size three. Yeah,  
118:57 - that's good. All right. And then let's do the 
same thing for the contact. Let's change that  
119:06 - to three. So I'll just copy this. Put it there 
and change that to three. Save it. To There  
119:20 - we go. That looks pretty good. It looks good. 
All right. And then the last part. Let's see,  
119:29 - let's go to projects. So you're right in this 
area, the image is getting too close. So I want  
119:44 - to increase the height on this on an extra large 
screen. So let's go to our last mixin. That's the  
119:54 - large media query. So let's include the extra 
large And so let's hear that was project's bio  
120:07 - image. And then let's change the height to 50 v 
H. There we go. That looks good. Right? And then,  
120:28 - let's see, we could make this have a fourth 
column, possibly, but I think it looks good.  
120:39 - So let's go through it real quick. We've got 
the main screen looks good on a big screen  
120:48 - and go down to a small screen looks good as well, 
we have our menu, right? Let's go to our about me,  
120:59 - that looks good. Let's go to a larger screen. Now 
I could take these and turn them into columns as  
121:07 - well. But I like the way that they're stacked 
because of the years. So current is on top,  
121:13 - and then it goes down. So I'm just gonna leave 
this as a column, I think it looks better. And  
121:18 - then projects, we already looked at that that 
looks good. And then contact. So that that looks  
121:31 - good as well. Nice. Alright, so let's talk about 
deploying this. So we're gonna deploy this today  
121:39 - on GitHub Pages, we could also use natla phi, 
that's another good one. But I went ahead and  
121:44 - uploaded the project to GitHub. And if you're not 
familiar with Git and GitHub, I have a video on  
121:49 - that as well, you can check out on my channel, 
but it's very simple. So I've got this uploaded,  
121:54 - and we're going to go to Settings. And then if 
you just scroll down to the GitHub Pages portion,  
122:00 - just set this to the master branch. Alright, 
let's scroll back down. And now it says your  
122:13 - site is ready to be published. So we could 
set a custom domain if we want. I'm just  
122:18 - gonna leave the default there. So now if we go 
here, and go to dist, there we go. So this is  
122:31 - live on the internet now. So that's gonna 
be it for this video. If you stick around  
122:36 - to the end. Thank you for watching. Alright,

Cleaned transcript:

Thanks for checking out this video, we're going to cover the basics of sass, and then we'll create a project from scratch and deploy it. And I'll show you how you can easily include sass in your workflow. And I want to give a big thanks to bow and free code camp.org. for publishing this video, Free Code Camp is an awesome resource. And on behalf of the community, thank you for all that you do. So before we get into this video, I'd like to quickly let you know who I am. I'm a husband, a father and a programmer, I've got over two decades of it experience. I'm a full stack developer, I recently decided to create a YouTube channel. And initially, I just wanted to help people. But after my first couple of videos, I realized that it's actually helping me to become a better programmer, I do research for every video, and a lot of times I come across things that I didn't know, or a better way of doing things. So I'm learning and teaching at the same time. So when when my channel is new, but I upload new videos every week, I'd greatly appreciate it if you check out my channel and subscribe. And that's enough of this. Let's get into the video. So we're going to go over the basics of sass, and set up our environment. And then we'll go through a project from beginning to end using sass. There's timestamps in the description if you'd like to skip through certain parts. So what is sass is a CSS extension language, and gives your CSS superpowers. Once you see how easy it is to write and how logical and organized it can be. You'll never write plain CSS again, you'll see what I mean in a minute. Let's look at what you need to write CSS. First, you'll need a code editor. And I recommend VS code because it's open source, and it has great extensions, and awesome community support. Now your browser can't read sass, so it has to be compiled into plain CSS. But don't let that scare you. It's easy. There's several ways that we could go about this, we could use node j s to run a compiler that will watch our sass files and compile them automatically for us. Or we could use Gulp to do the same thing. Or we could use an extension in VS code. And for this video, that's what we're going to do, we're going to use live sass compiler. Another extension that we're going to use is live server. If you're unfamiliar with VS code, and how to set it up for web development, I do have a video on that. I'll have a link in the description below. Alright, I'm going to quickly walk you through installing the live sass extension. So in VS code, we'll go to extensions, and we will search for live sass. And there you'll see live SAS compiler, go ahead and click on that and then click Install. And after that's installed, we're going to look at some settings. So let's go to our settings. And then we'll search for SAS and then click on live SAS compiler there. And then you'll see in the format settings, we're going to want to change the Save location. Now these settings are a personal preference. By default, it will compile your CSS and put it into the same directory. And I prefer for the compiled file to go into my distribution folder. So we'll click on edit in settings, Jason, and then here we're going to add some settings. So these are your options. So the default is at the top here, format is expanded. So there's no compression going on. The extension name is dot CSS, and then the safe path is no. So that means it's going to go into the same directory as your sass files. So you could also change the format to compressed if you want. And it will go ahead and compress and minify your CSS all in one shot. And then you can change the extension name to dot min dot CSS, and then you see what they're where we can put it into our distribution folder. So I'm actually going to do just a combination of the two for this video, we're going to keep the format at expanded and the extension is dot CSS. And we're just going to change the safe path to slash dist slash CSS. And then we'll save that and we're good to go. Alright, now that we have all of that set up, let's create a standard folder structure here. So I have a new project folder that I've created, and I opened it in VS code. And let's go ahead and create a folder here called dist. And then within our dist folder, we'll create an HTML file index dot HTML. We'll use Emmet. We'll use exclamation enter, get a template here and we'll just name this tutorial. We'll add a link here to our CSS. So currently, we don't have one but we will be adding it. Notice the extension here is CSS not sass or SCSS. So this CSS file is what's going to be compiled. Once we've created our sass files, Now, before we create our sass files, it's important to understand that there are two syntaxes supported by sass. So there's the SCSS syntax, and it uses the file extension SCSS. And this stands for sassy CSS is basically a superset of CSS, which means essentially, that all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well. I'll show you that in a minute. But because of this similarity, it's the easiest syntax to get used to and the most popular. Now the other syntax is the indented syntax. And this was the original syntax for sass. And it uses the file extension dot s. css, the indented syntax supports all of the same features as SCSS. But it uses indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons. There are a few other minor differences. But we're not going to be using SPSS in this video. So we're not going to go over those. Alright, so we'll be using the SCSS syntax. And so let's go ahead and create that structure. So be sure you're in the root of your project. And go ahead and create another folder here. And we're going to name this SCSS. And then within here, we're going to create a main dot s CSS. Alright, now that we have that file open, we've got our extension installed. So now you should see this watch sass at the bottom. So go ahead and click on that. And you're going to see an output here. We'll see here that it's watching for our sass files now, and it is compiling and generating them automatically. And now it's watching for us to save the file again. And when we save it, it's going to automatically recompile and create that CSS file every single time that we save the document. So we didn't add this CSS folder here, but now we have a folder in dist. And so that extension created the folder, and it created our CSS file. And of course, we don't have anything in our sass file. And so I don't expect to have anything in our CSS file either. So remember, we said that any valid CSS is also a valid sass. So let me show you what I mean by that. So here in our sass file, we can add, let's just do something generic here, we'll say body background. And we'll set it to blue. And I'll hit save. And it automatically compiled our CSS for us. So now if we go to the CSS file, we'll see body background blue, just the same as we see it here. so we can write plain CSS in our sass file, and it will work just fine. So I also have a live server installed. So I'm going to go ahead and hit that go live. And here you see we have a blue website. So One important note here is that we should never modify the CSS file. Only modify the CSS file. Every time the compiler runs, it's going to overwrite the CSS file. So the first sass feature that we're going to look at is variables. And now you might say CSS has variables too. And that's true. css does have variables now. But sass has had variables long before CSS. Currently, CSS variables compatibility across browsers is about 90%. So that's pretty good. And I don't see any reason not to use CSS variables. But when you use sass variables, they don't compile into CSS variables, they compile to the actual value. So let me show you what I mean there. So in normal CSS, we could add variables like this. So now we could set our background here using a CSS variable, just like that. And so now if I save this, you'll see that our CSS file is pretty much identical to the scss file. And if we switch over to our website, we now have a gray background. So now, let me show you the difference between this and the sass variables. So with sass, we can get rid of the root. And instead of the dashes, we'll add $1 sign. So $1 sign indicates that is a variable. So instead of calling bar, we will just input the variable. And we'll save this, we'll switch over to our website, and it's still great. And let's look at our CSS now. We don't have any variables defined, it puts the actual value there. So using sass variables has a 100 percent compatibility across browsers. Alright, next, let's talk about maps. So if you're familiar with JavaScript, you could compare maps to arrays. maps are lists of key value pairs. So I'll create one here. So we'll define a variable. And we'll name it font weights. And then to to define a map, we start with parentheses. So answer a key. So we'll say, regular will be the key, and then the value will be 400. We'll enter another one, we separate these by commas. So we'll say medium will be 500. And then bold, will be 700 is probably not the best example. But you can create a map of colors or different things. So that we have something to really add this to let's put some HTML markup in here. So we'll add a div with the class of main. And then we will put a paragraph and we'll just put some Mormon here 50. Right now in the body, we could apply a font weight. Globally, if we wanted to get a value out of the map, we'll use map get, right, and so it's looking for the map. And that would be font weights. And then the key would be, let's say bold. So this may seem like a bit much. But if we have our font weights defined throughout our CSS in many different areas, and for some reason, we want to change the way that the normal medium or bold font looks, let's say we want bold to actually be 900. Instead of 700. I can change it in this one spot, instead of searching through all of my CSS and changing it on each individual line. Now before I save this, let me pull up the website. Oh, and our text, we forgot to text color. Let's apply our color. And we'll set that to text color. Now we see that everything is in bold. So this looks at our map, and we tell it which key to look for. It finds the key and then it extracts the value and it puts the value here as font weight, we go to CSS, we'll see that our font weight is set to 700. Right, next, let's talk about nesting. So nesting might be one of the best features of SAS. But depending on how big your project is, be careful with too much nesting. Using classes that can be reused instead of nest after nest is much better. But to demonstrate nesting, we will look at our paragraph here. So we have a div with the class of main in a paragraph. So let's look at the main div. First, let's say that we want to center it and add some margin on the side. So we'll set the width here to 80%. And we'll set margin, top and bottom to zero left and right to auto. And this is just plain CSS. So if we go here, we'll see now it's centered and we've got some margin on the sides. Alright, so now if we wanted to style our paragraph, normally, we would have to do main and then paragraph and do it like this. Or we could just do paragraph and that would globally change all of the paragraphs. But we don't want to do that. with SAS, we can nest so within main, we could just do this. And let's say we just want to put that font weight only on this paragraph. We'll move it down here. And I'll save that switch. And we will see. Same thing, nothing has changed. And if we go to our CSS, you'll see that it has written it as proper CSS so that the browser can parse it. Now if we want to do this properly, let's add a class here to the paragraph. We'll set it to Main paragraph. And then so instead of targeting the tag directly, we can do main paragraph by saying save that now it compiles properly into CSS. But with sass, we have some shortcuts. So instead of typing main again, we could take this part out and we can use an ampersand. So ampersand equals the parents. Right? So let's save that and go to our CSS. Now, it's not quite right, because its main underscore paragraph on its own, not within the main parent. So to fix that, we actually have to use something called interpolation. What that means is we don't want just dot main paragraph, we want everything before it. So we have to wrap the ampersand in hashtag curly braces. So now what we could do is add a hover on the paragraph. And so we want to add that on the paragraph, not main. So we'll nest that again. And this time, we'll use just one ampersand. And we'll use colon hover like we would normally. And then let's just change the color to pink. All right, now we'll save this. And if we go to our website, and we hover over it, now it's pink. Right, let's look at our CSS. Let's see what happened here. So we've got everything separated as it should be in CSS now. So let's talk about separating files. So with sass, we can create partial sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you could include in other sass files. So if we're working on a large project, it's a great way to modularize your CSS and make things easier to maintain. A partial is simply a sass file named with a leading underscore. So the underscore lets sass know that the file is only a partial, and that it should not generate a CSS file. So the compiler is going to ignore those files that begin with an underscore. So let's create a partial here, make sure that you're in your SCSS folder. And we'll create a new file, and we're going to name it underscore recettes dot SCSS. All right now in this resets file, we're just going to include our normal resets. So we will do a box sizing of border box margin, zero, and padding of zero. All right, just some normal resets there, I'm going to save that. And then in our main CSS, we'll want to include them at the top here, because generally, we'll have our resets at the top. So to include that, we will use an app import. And then we will indicate the name. So notice here that we don't have to put the underscore or the extension. So now if I save this, and we look at our main CSS, it has compiled our resets into our main CSS from the partial. And also notice that the vendor prefixes are automatically added by the compiler. So what we could also do is we could create another file here, and we could name it underscore variables, that SCSS. And then in our variables, we could take all of these, and we'll put them into our variables partial. And I'll save that and then I'm going to use Alt Shift Down arrow to duplicate that and will include our variables. So now if I save that, you'll see that the variables are still working. So by using partials, we could separate major components into partials. And this is especially helpful when working with a team on large projects, we can break up the components and work on them individually. Alright, so now let's talk about functions. So if you're familiar with JavaScript functions in sass are very similar. So to create a function, we'll put it here at the top and we're gonna say at function to define that this is a function and then we will name it so this this map gets In the font weights down here, it's a bit much it's kind of ugly, we can shorten that up, especially if we're going to be using it all over our CSS. So we're going to create a function that is called weights. And then we're going to open parentheses. And we're going to put an argument in here, we're going to put a variable of weight name. And then we're going to open it with curly braces. And within the function, we're going to return. And we're going to use map gets. And we're going to target the font weights. And the key is going to be our weights name. So this variable here is going to be passed within our sass file whenever we call it. So instead of map get down here, we're going to use the function name weights. And within that, we'll pass it the weight name that we're looking for. And if we change this to regular, it would return the regular weight. So let me save this. And we'll go to our CSS. Now we're looking for the font weight, let's see what it what it is font weight of 400. Right. So that's our regular font. If I go back here and change it back to bold, and we check our compiled CSS. Now it's 700. Right now we'll move on to mix ins. And so mix ins are similar to functions. So to demonstrate this, let's add some more HTML markup. So I'm going to just duplicate this, this paragraph here, when you use Alt, Shift Down Arrow, create another paragraph. And I'm going to save that, then back in our sass file in the main here. Let's say we want to display this as flex. And we want to justify the content center and align items center. If you haven't learned CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid, I have videos on those as well. I'll put links in the description below. Let me save this. And let's switch over to our website. And we see now that our paragraphs are side by side, because we define them as flex, by default, that is going to flex to a row, go back to our code here. And let's just say that we have many of these flex boxes that we need to create. And we don't want to type display flex and justify content and align items a million times. So we'll go up here, and we're going to create a mixin. So at symbol mixin. And we're going to name this and we'll name it, flex center. And then within flex center, we're going to put all of this content that we don't want to repeatedly type in now within main, instead of typing all of that, we will include the mixin. So at include, and then flex center, just like that. Now I'll save that, and let's check out our CSS. And in our main, we've got all of our flex. And again, it's added all of the vendor prefixes as well. Now similar to functions, we could also pass an argument into a mixin. So let's say we want to pass it direction. And then we could define flex direction, as direction. So now instead of including flex center, we're going to also include an argument here, and by default, it is a row. So let's, let's define it as column. And I'm going to save that and let's go back to our website. And now you'll see that they are in a column and not a row. And of course, if I change this to row and save it, and now you'll see they're in a row, or so mixins and functions are very similar, but just remember that functions should be used to compute values and return values. mixins should define styles. Another example of a mixin is choosing between a light and dark theme. So by default, right now, our website is a dark theme. So we could add a mixin and we'll name it theme. And we're going to pass it a boolean value. So we can assign Boolean values to variables. So we will say light theme and by default, we're going to set it to true So now, again, if you're familiar with JavaScript, we can in sass, we can use if statements. So we're going to say if light theme. So that means if light theme is true, then we're going to set background. Currently background is set to primary color. But what we're going to do is we're going to wrap this in a light, and then we can tell it how much to lighten up by we're going to say 100%. So it's basically going to invert the color. And then we will need to set the color as well. Currently, that set to the text color, the text color is white by default, so we're going to need to do the opposite. So we're going to darken the text, color. And we're going to do that by 100%. Alright, so now to use this, we're going to create a let's go down here at the bottom, and we're going to create a Lites class. And we're going to include our theme, we're going to pass it that variable. So light theme, true. I don't have to actually type this light theme, I could just say true. This makes it a little bit more identifiable. Alright, so let's save this. And now we need to add this class somewhere. So let's just, let's just add it to the body for now. Class of light, save that. And now let's go to our website. Now we have a light theme. And so now if we change this to false, let's see what happens. It's still a dark theme. Even though we have the class of lights on body, it's still a dark theme. How is that possible? So let's look at our main CSS, we've got our body here, remain over main paragraphs. But there's no light theme here. Go back to our SCSS. And we've got it included here. Well, we've included the theme, and we've said false. So if we go up here to theme, so if it's true, it's going to add these CSS styles to the light class. If it's false, it's not going to add anything. So that means the light class is empty. So when the compiler runs, if it finds a definition that's empty, it's just not going to include it in the CSS at all. Alright, so if I go back here, and I change this back to true, let's look at the compiled CSS. And now we have our light class, right back in our main sass file. mixins are pretty cool. So I'm going to show you one more mixin. This one has to do with media query. So we're going to create a mixin. And we're going to call it mobile. And then we're going to use a media query. So just a normal CSS media query, we're going to say max width of, let's just say 800 pixels. And then in here, we want to include content. So this content will be passed when the mixin is called. Now what we also could do, instead of defining this, this width here, we could actually use a variable and it would be better to use a variable because if we ever wanted to change, it would be easy to change. So we're going to create a variable here called mobile. And we will just set that to 800 pixels. And then back here in our sass file, instead of putting the value there of 800 pixels, we'll just include the mobile variable. Alright, so now let's see, what did I miss here content? There we go. Now to include this, let's say if the width gets below 800 pixels, we're going to want that to change to a column. Alright, so here within main, so here, we're going to include our mixin include, and then that is going to be mobile, and then within this, basically view this as your media query. So what do you want it to do when it's below 800 pixels? So we're going to say, flex direction, column. Right, let me save that. And I'll switch to the website. Alright, so let's make this smaller And there you go. Once we get below 800 pixels, it changes to a column. Right and then move it back over, it's back to a row. Right. And then if we ever need to change the width, we have the variables here where we can change our widths. Alright, so now let's talk about extensions. So we can extend an element. And so the element that we extend it to would then inherit all the styles from the selected element. So to demonstrate that, let's go to our HTML, we'll change the classes to paragraph one and paragraph two. Alright, so now here, we will change this to paragraph one. And so let's say that we want to extend all of the styles of paragraph one, on to paragraph two, we want them to look the same, but we just want to change one or two things on paragraph two. And we don't want to have to retype all of the styles on both paragraphs. So we could do this, we have to interpolate again, the ampersand. And then we'll do paragraph two. And then here, we could extend main paragraph one. And we'll save that switch. And now they're both identical just as they were before. But now we want to make a change to this paragraph. So we've extended all of the same properties. But let's say we want to, we'll use hover again. And this time, we'll change the color to our accent color. Right, and so now, we have our accent color. So if there was a bunch of styles here in paragraph one, and we didn't want to retype everything, we could just extend from that class on to this class. The last thing that we're going to look at is operations. So, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. So in normal CSS, we could do calc. And then I don't know why we'd want to do this. But if for some reason we wanted to subtract 40%. That would work just fine. But in SAS, we don't need the calculation. And it will work just like this. We'll hit save, go back in just the same. Now one thing to note, with the normal CSS calculation, I could do minus 400 pixels. And see this will work just fine. But with sass, we can't mix types. So the operation has to be of the same type. So if we're using percentage, they all have to be percentage, or they all have to be pixels. So now let's see what that looks like in the CSS. So we have 80% minus 40%. So now we just have the result of that, which is 40%. So if we so if we use the normal CSS calc, let's look at what the compiled CSS looks like. So it's gonna go ahead and pass that entire calculation into our normal compiled CSS. Alright, so that's pretty much the basics of sass. So if you want to learn more, you can look at the documentation on sass, dash lang.com. sass is very powerful. And once you get the hang of it, it's hard to go back to normal CSS. Alright, now let's look at a real world example. So this is what we're going to build. A portfolio website has this cool animated menu and several pages in the menu along with the entire website is responsive. And we're going to take a mobile first approach when we build this. So here, I've got VS code open, and I've created a project folder on my computer and then I opened it in VS code. And all that I've done so far is I created a dist folder, along with an image folder, and I just brought in the images that we'll be using in this project. I will have a link in the description below so that you can download the project files as well. So in the dist folder, let's start out by creating an index that HTML file. I'm going to close the sidebar by pressing Ctrl B. And now let's start with our HTML markup. So we use Emmet exclamation, enter. That gives us a boilerplate and let's title this and we'll just go with Mike's With a portfolio we're also going to add our style sheet, which will be created for us from our sass. So we'll add a link. And we'll set that to CSS, main dot CSS, and the body here, we're going to start out with a header. And then we'll create a div with the class of menu button. And then within here, we'll create a span with the class of menu button burger. So the menu button is going to be pure CSS, we're not going to use any images or fonts for that. Within the header, let's create a nav, we'll have a class on that of nav. And then we'll create our menu items. So we'll have a ul with the class of menu nav. And then our allies will have a class of menu nav item. Right now, we'll have a link with the class of menu nav link. And that is going to go so our first one will be home. So that's index dot HTML. And we'll name that one home. Alright, so now we're going to take this Li and we're going to duplicate it down three times. So Alt Shift Down Arrow, 123. So in our home, this is the page that we're on right now. So we're going to set this Li to active. And then the next one will be our about. So we'll say about me. And the next one is our projects will say my projects. And the last one is our contact. And I will say contact me. Right, I think that's it for the header. Let's go to our main section now. Alright, we're going to start with a main tag. And then we'll have a section. And we'll have a class of home. And then we'll create an h2. And in here, we'll say I, my name is then an h1 with the class of home name. Then here, we'll put the name so Mike. And then we're going to have a span with the class of home name, last name here, we'll put the last name Smith. And then we'll have an h2. And this will be his titles. Web developer, designer, and programmer. Right now we're going to add our social icons, we're actually going to put that in our sections still. So we'll add a div with the class of social icons, and then a link. And that's not going to go anywhere. And then we'll add the icon. So we're gonna use, we're gonna use Font Awesome, and I'll show you how to set that up in just a minute. So we're going to use an icon with the class of FA be in another class of fa, Twitter. And we're also going to add a class of FA times two. Right? And then let's take these three lines and copy that down. three more times. And then we'll change Twitter, to Facebook, Instagram and GitHub. Right. And then after that, one last thing is footer. And that's just going to contain our copyright. So we'll do a present copy for the copyright symbol, and then copy, right? Whatever you current year is, we're going to have some basic JavaScript, we're going to include a script with a source, and the source will be j s, main dot j s. Alright, I think that is it for the markup. So let's look at the Font Awesome, we also have to add something here for that. Alright, so this is Font Awesome website. And they recently changed things up a little bit, you actually have to sign up for a free account. So I've already logged in. And I'm just going to go to my kits. And here's the kit that I have. And so what we need to do is to copy this script and put that into our HTML files. So I'm just going to hit copy code. And then we will put that here. Alright, so I think that is it for the index dot HTML. Let's go ahead and save this. And we'll see what this looks like. So I have have live server installed. So if you just right click here, you can say, open with live server, or you can see there's some shortcut here. You can see that that looks pretty ugly. There's no CSS. So okay, so let's start with our SAS going to open the sidebar by pressing Ctrl V. And then make sure that you're in the root and create a folder SCSS. Then within SCSS, we're going to create a file of main dot s CSS. And we're actually going to start with let's create another file. And we'll name it underscore config, dot SCSS. So that's going to be a partial. And we're actually going to create partials for all of our elements. In a large project, that's what you would do, you would separate everything into partials. And this isn't a large project, but we're going to go through that workflow so that you can see it. Let me close the sidebar here. Ctrl B, in our config, we're going to have our variables. So we'll have a primary color. And that's going to be a dark gray. And then we'll have our secondary color. And that will be an orange. And then we'll put our resets in here. So box sizing, border box, margin, zero, and padding zero, just some standard resets. All right, I'm gonna save that in, then we'll go to our main CSS. And the first thing we need to do is import that config. So we'll say import config, we don't have to put the underscore or the extension. Alright, first, let's look at the body. And we're going to set the background to the primary color. And then we'll set the text color. For now we'll just set that to a white, we're going to come back to that in a minute. The height will be 100 Vh. So 100 view height view, view that as a percentage. So basically, it's 100% of the available viewport height, we're gonna change the font family, like the sagoo. And we're going to set the line height to one. All right, now, we're going to target our h1, h2 and h3. And I want the font weights of those to be a little bit less, more normal 400. And then we've got some links in here. So we're going to target all of the links globally. And we're going to set the color to white for now. And the text decoration to none. Right and then let's look at our header. So for the header, we want it to have a position of fixed. We need it to always be on top of everything else. So we're going to set a z index up to a width of 100% And padding of one rim. So if you're unfamiliar with REM and M units, so REM units are based on the font size of the body, so the default font size of the body is 16 pixels. And so one, one rim would be one times 16. Two REM would be two times 16. So that would be 32 pixels. If we change the font size of the body to 20 pixels, then one REM would be 20 pixels and two REM would be 40 pixels, m m is pretty much the same thing. Except it's not based on the font size of the body, it's based on the font size of the parent. All right, so now let's go to our z main, target the main here, and we'll set a height of 100% and a width of 100%. And then we'll start doing some nesting. Let's target our social icons. For the for those, I want them to be position fixed with a bottom. So from the bottom, one rim, and from the left, one rim. Within the icons, there are links. So let's target those. We want a padding on those of 0.4 rim and then on hover, we're going to change the color, we'll set that to our secondary color. Lastly, we'll target our footer. And we will set the font size on there to one rim. We're gonna set a fixed position on this as well, because we're going to, we want that to be at the bottom say bottom point forum. Then, right one room, do a text align right? Having a one realm and we'll set the color on that to white for now. So before we save this and load it, we actually have to initialize our sass extension. So we're running the live sass compiler extension. So what we'll do is we'll hit watch sass, if you don't have VS code set up, I've got a video with a web dev setup where we walk through the installation of these extensions on the hit watch SAS. And it opens up an output here, and it's watching and it is compiling our CSS every time that we hit save and automatically updated with live server. We go to our files here, we can see that it created a CSS directory and we have our main CSS here. Alright, so that is still not looking great. Let's look at some CSS that is directly applicable to the home page. So what we're going to do is we're going to create in the CSS folder, we're going to create a new partial, and we'll name it home that SCSS. Alright, and so in here, we're going to target our home class. And we're going to set the height to 100%. Put a padding on the top of 40 Vh. So again, let's view that as a percentage 40% of the available viewport height, I'm going to set the overflow to hidden. We don't want any scroll bars on the homepage, it should always fit. We're going to align items to the center. And we'll do a text align center. And then let's set our background. So we're gonna have that picture that is URL. We need to go up one level, so dot dot slash image slash and then it was modeled dash one dot jpg. And then we're going to set a background size to cover. Alright, let's just save that and see what we have so far. Oh, and we have to go back to our main and we have to import that home. So import home. Save. Alright, so I think the images here it's just let's expand this. Yep. So the image is actually there. It's just not positioned properly, yet. So what we're going to do back in our home on the background, we're also going to set some positioning. So we're going to say center top. That's a little bit better. Now the image is too, too bright, it's too white. So we're going to put an overlay on top of it. And there's several ways to do that, you could use HTML markup, and then target that and create an overlay. That way, you could use pseudo elements. But we're actually going to do it right here in the background. So we're going to add a linear gradient, and then we're going to say, We want the gradient to go to the right. And then we put in our colors, so we're going to use RGBA. And then that takes the first part of it takes your color, so we're going to set primary color, really use that variable, and then we will set this 2.9 opacity. And then we'll do another RGBA for the second gradient value, again, primary color. And we could do point nine again and have it the same across, but we're going to set the right side of it 2.3 then we need a comma here. All right, let me save this. There, that looks a lot better. Make sure that you're still within the home class. And now we're going to target our underscore name. So this is going to be the home underscore name. The ampersand remember, and present always refers to the parent. So it's the same as typing dot home underscore name. Okay, so in here, we're gonna set our font size to five rim, we'll set the padding on the bottom to one rim margin on top of one rim. And we're going to set a border on the bottom. And we'll set that to two pixels solid. And for now, we're going to set this to white. And then within that name, remember, we have a span that goes around the last name. And so that was present, which is going to be the same as dot home underscore name, dash dash last. And we're going to set the color on here to the secondary color. And the font weights, we're gonna increase that one up to 700. All right, let's save this. Now it's looking pretty good. Alright, so when we're hovering over these icons, the color just kind of pops right in. So I'm going to add a bit of a transition to that. So back in our config, let's add a mixin. So at symbol mixin, we'll name this transition ease. In then we will set a transition. It will set all point O five seconds, is in out. Okay, so normally on transition, I would target what we're trying to transition is the color is the position, what is it? Here, we want to reuse this. So when I include this mixin, I want it to target any transition that it can set it to a point five or half a second ease in and out. Alright, so let me save this. Let's go to our main. And we had a hover in our social icons right here. Alright, and so let's add the transition on the link. So we'll do to include the mixin we do include, and then the Nixon name, transition ease. Great, let's save this. And let's hover over them. You see that it's slowly changing the color is now let's look here at our colors, we have it set to white, but in our config, we have the ability to change the primary and secondary color. So if we change the primary color to white, then you won't be able to see the text. So what we're going to do in our config is we're going to create a function that is going to give us an appropriate color for our text. So to create a function, we'll do add function. And this is a lot like a JavaScript function if you're familiar with JavaScript, so we're going to set this to set text color We're going to pass it a variable of color. And then we're going to use an if statement. So we're going to say at symbol if, and then lightness, we're going to evaluate the lightness of the color that we're passing it. So if the lightness is greater than 40%, then we're going to return we'll just we'll set this to black. Alright, so if the lightness is greater than 40%, so it means it's a light color, then we want to return a dark color, so black, and then we'll do else. So if it is a dark color, we want to return white. Right, so now we can use this function, instead of declaring the color. Go back to our main here. So instead of white, we're going to call set, text color. And then we're going to pass it our primary color. So it's going to evaluate this primary color, which is dark. And it's going to return us the white value. So anywhere else that we have the color set, we can swap that out. So say set text color, primary color. Let's see, did we set that anywhere else? I think there was one other spots. Yep, on the footer. So set text color. Primary, there we go. We'll save that. Nothing's going to change obviously. In, up, so we also had it here on our border. So this line that goes across in the middle here, we're going to set that as well set text color primary. I think we're good there. Okay, so everything is looking pretty good, except for our menu, of course. So let's start to let's let's get to work on our menu. So let me open up the sidebar here. And we're going to create a new partial. So underscore menu, dot SCSS. And close the sidebar. And let's see, first we'll target the menu button. We're going to set that to a position of absolute. Set the Z index here to one, right, one room and top one room. Okay, so we're going to absolutely position this. So we want this in the top right corner, we'll set the height to 20 pixels, and the width to 28 pixels. And when we hover over this, we want a cursor pointer. And we're going to include our transition mixin. So include transition is because we're going to be adding some transition animation to this. Alright, so within the menu button, we have our menu button burger, so we can do ampersand underscore burger. And this one, we will again position absolute we're going to say that this one would be right zero, and top is going to be point five rim the width of 28 pixels. Height of three pixels in the background will be our set text color. And that's going to be our primary color. And again, we're going to include on this one, our ease transition. Alright, so let's save this and see what we have. And actually we have to remember back in our main, we have to include this. So import that was menu. Right and so now we have a line. So that's just one line in so again, let's look at the HTML. So the menu button is basically a wrapper, and we're using this we're going to be using this as our click event. Within the menu button. We're going to have our bars For the hamburger, we just configured the middle bar. And so we set it to 28 pixels wide, three pixels high, and the background color is going to be the text color, which is going to be white. And so now what we're going to do to create the other two bars is we're going to use pseudo elements. So within the burger, so we're going to use ampersand before. And with a pseudo element, we have our content, we'll set that to nothing. We have a position of absolute is that the top two negative eight pixels, so we want it to move up eight pixels from its initial position. And the width will be 28 pixels. Height of three pixels. Background color will be the set text color. And we're going to also include or ease transition. Okay, and now let's save that. And now we have our top bar. Right. And so now to add the bottom bar, we're within the burger class still. So we're going to use ampersand after. And we're basically going going to do the same thing. So I'm just going to copy this. And then instead of eight pixels up, we want to go eight pixels down. And I want the bottom bar to be not the same width. So set that to 20. All right, and then let's save that. There we go. So now we have our menu button. Okay, so now on the menu button, we're going to have it animate a bit. So again, still within the burger through JavaScript, we're going to assign it an open class. So when the open class gets applied to the menu, we want it to transform. And we're going to rotate 720 degrees. And then we're going to set background to transparent. Let's save this for now. And we'll come back to it. Let's go ahead and look at the JavaScript. So let me open up the sidebar. And in our distribution folder, let's create another folder named j s. And then within j s, let's create a file, rename that main dot j s. Alright, and close. The sidebar, we'll start by targeting are DOM elements. So we'll set some constants here, we're going to set the menu button. We'll use document dot query selector. And then here we can query by tag or by ID, or by class. So was we'll use class here and menu button was the class. Right, and we'll create another constant of hamburger. So the menu button again, that's the basically the wrapper, and then the hamburger is our span. So we'll do document query selector. And that was menu menu button for burger. Okay, so then we're going to create a variable called show menu, we're going to set that to false. So initially, the menu is not shown. Then we will add an event listener to the menu button. We're going to listen for the click event. And then we will toggle menu we'll call this function that we're going to create here. So we're going to create a function called toggle menu. And so we'll start by saying if not show menu. So the exclamation is a NOT operator. So if show menu is false, then we're going to get that hamburger class and we're going to target the class list and we're going to add Open. So we're going to say that it's now open, then we'll need to set our show menu to true. So now we know that the menu is open, and then we'll put our else statement. So if the menu is open, we want to do the opposite, right? So hamburger, class list, remove, open. So just the opposite. And then we're also going to want to set our show menu, back to false. Alright, so that's it for the JavaScript for now, add a few more lines in a minute. But let's save this and let's see what it does. So there we go, it rotates and the middle line becomes transparent. So if I click it again, it should go back to normal. There we go. So that is the first part. So the goal is to make that turn into an X. So now what we'll do here is in our open class, we're now going to target our pseudo elements. So we'll do ampersand before. So this is targeting that top, that top bar, and we're going to set the Transform, rotate to 45 degrees. And we're also going to add a translate, translate moves it in the first value is going to be your x or your horizontal position. So we want to move it five pixels over. And then the second value is your y or your vertical. So we want to move it down eight pixels. Alright, let's just let's save that and see what we have so far. There we go. That's part of our x right there. Okay, so now let's target our after. So and present. After that's going to be the bottom line. Now remember, the bottom line was a bit shorter, so we need to actually change that. So we'll say width 28 pixels make it the same as the top now. And then we will add our transform with a rotate of this time will be a negative 45 degrees to make that other side of the x. And then we will translate this one to three pixels over and negative seven pixels. So move it up a bit. And I had to play around with these numbers to get it to work just right, but this is what I came up with. So let's save that. And now when I click it, we should have an x There we go. Alright, pretty cool. Okay, so now we want to show the menu. Alright, so for the menu, let's target the nav. And on that we want the position to be fixed in the top of zero, and a left of zero width of 100 view width. So with with view width is the same as view height. So 100 would be like saying 100% of the available viewport width, we're going to set the opacity to point nine, eight. So just want to see a little bit behind it. And initially we're going to set the visibility to hidden. Okay, so within the nav, we're going to do the same thing in JavaScript and we're going to add a class to it. So it's gonna be the same thing. We're going to do the ampersand, so it's mean nav dot open. And then if it is open, we want to change the visibility to visible still within the nav, let's target our menu nav. Right and then then the main menu nav, we have our menu items the home about me my projects contact me. So we're going to display those as flex. And then we're going to see if flex flow we'll set that to column. And then if for some reason we have a weird device height, we'll set this to wrap. We're going to align items center, justify content center. We want the height to be 100 view height overflow hidden. We don't want any scroll bars ever on our menu. We're gonna set the background to the primary color will do the list style. So let's get rid of those. Those bullet points, let's do a padding on the right to see one rim, and then we'll do a transform and translate actually rindu translate y, we'll set this to a negative 100%. And we're going to include our ease mixin. Alright, so what this is doing, if you're not familiar with Flexbox, I have a video on that as well and check it out at my channel. So what we're going to do on the menu is we have it, translate y, so that is going to be your vertical, and we have it set to a negative 100%. So that means the position of the menu is going to start off the page at the top. And when we click the button, we want it to come in from the top. So what we'll do here is within our menu nav, when the menu nav gets assigned the open class, then we want to transform, translate y to zero, so the initial position, and we're going to need to go into our JavaScript and add some more lines here. So we need to also target our nav. So that is going to be document, query selector. And then we will also need our menu nav, which is the UL, that was menu. Alright, so we have those. And so now we're going to do the same thing in here. We'll take our nav, class list, add, open. And then our menu nav, class list, add, open. Alright, so I'm just going to take these, copy them down here, and we're going to change add to remove Ctrl D to select multiple of the same. So if I highlight, remove, I can control D and select all three of them have three cursors. That's a good, good little shortcut to learn. That's it for the JavaScript for now. Let's save that. And let's see what we have. So now you see that the menu items are gone. So now when we click on this, there we go. Now we need to format our actual links here. So let's go back to our menu sets. Okay, so still within our menu, now, we're going to see it was menu nav underscore item. So we're going to target each item, the menu itself is coming down from the top, we want the menu items to come in from the right, so we're going to transform translate x this time, so x is your horizontal, and the initial value is going to be 100 view width. So we want the links to be all the way off the right side of the page, we're going to include our transition mixin. And then in JavaScript, we're going to add the open class just like we did on the others. And when it's open, we want to transform translate x to the initial position, so that we'll bring them in from the right, we're also going to add an active class to our menu items. And then we're going to target the a the link within and we want to set the color on that to the secondary, the secondary color. And so that's just going to highlight which page you're currently on. And then in the JavaScript, we have a couple more lines to add. Alright, we're going to add a constant here of nav items. And we're do documents and we can't do query selector because that selects one element. So we're going to use query selector all and we're going to get an array of elements here. And that is menu nav item Right, and so then down here, we need to add that or we need to add that open class to these. So what we'll do is we'll do nav items. And we'll use a high order array function will do for each, we're going to use an arrow function here. So we're going to loop through the items, and we're going to pull each time we're going to pull one item out. And so in the function, we'll say item dot class list, dot add, open. Alright, so we'll do the same thing down here. Except instead of adding, we're going to remove, right, and that should be everything for the JavaScript. Now there's nothing else that we're going to add in here. So let's see what that does now. All right, they came in, if you can barely see it, they come in pretty quickly from the right, but at the same time, that the menu is coming down, so it's not very noticeable. So let's add some more sass to our menu. Alright, so now make sure that you are within the menu nav still. Right, and we're going to use ampersand links is going to be a menu nav link, we want to display these inline block, we're going to do a font size of two REM text transform to uppercase. padding, top and bottom of two REM zero left and right font weights of 300. And we're going to include our ease transition. And then on hover roids do a color of secondary color. Right, let's save that. Let's see what we have now. It looks pretty good. But see they're coming in all at the same time. And a coming in too quickly. It's going to our menu sass. And then all the way at the bottom, we're going to include a for loop. So very similar to JavaScript. If you're familiar with that at four, then we're going to declare a variable of I. And we're going to say from one through four, because we have four links. Alright, so now we're going to target our menu, menu nav, item, and we're going to target the nth child. And we can't just put the variable in here you see how it's highlighting red, it's telling us that you can't do that within a function. So we need to wrap this with dollar sign curly braces. So now we've targeted the nth child. So this is going to iterate through the links. So the initial one is going to target the first link, then it's going to count up one. So that would be the second week, the third link the fourth link. So on each link, we're going to do a transition delay. And in here, we can use the variable as it is. So we're going to do the variable times 0.1 seconds. And then we're going to add to that 0.15 seconds. And this is a complicated formula formula, but it's what I came up with. Alright, so it's going to iterate through each one, and it's going to add a delay to each one so they should stagger in. Alright, let's save that. And now let's see what we have. There we go. Alright, so let's look something is a little bit off here. Let me go. Yeah, okay, actually here in the home menu, the margin bottom, or the margin should be margin bottom. On the name that's a little bit off right there. So let's save that. There we go. That looks much better. So that's gonna be it for the homepage. So now let's look at the about page. So let me open the sidebar here. And in the distribution folder, we want to add a file about the HTML. And let's go ahead and add the sass file for that as well. We'll add the partial underscore About SCSS, close the sidebar, let me close some of these, we don't need the JavaScript anymore. We shouldn't need the menu. Alright, so let's start with the HTML markup, we're just going to begin with the index dot HTML. We'll copy everything from there, paste it into about. And let's say about Mike Smith. All right, the menu then now let's take the active off of the home. And we'll put it on the about. And then let's look at our section here. Let's change this to about, then this first part of the section here, let's delete. And we'll add a div about bio image. And then within here, we'll have an h2 with the class of text, secondary. And we'll say bio. So we're going to add a class here, text secondary. So this will be a reusable class, anything that we put it on will have the secondary color. So let's go ahead and do that go to our main sass file. And we'll just put it right here. Text secondary. And this is just going to change the color to the secondary color. Right, and let's go ahead while we're in here, let's add our about sass partial. written here, let's add a paragraph and we'll add some Lorem in here. 30. Now under this, we're gonna have some jobs almost like a small resume, we'll add a div with the class of jobs. Another div jobs. Job. So each job. So the first one, I will say we'll put an h2, the class of text secondary. And let's say 2017 to current, and then we'll do it h. h three will say that he works for Google. And then an H six is position, full stack developer, and then we'll add a paragraph with some more Lorem. I'll put 20 on there. Let's take this job here. And let's duplicate it two more times. So Alt Shift down, one, two. All right, so let's change this one, to 2015 to 2017. And let's say that was Microsoft. And let's see, front end developer. And the last one here, we'll say 2012. To 2015. We'll just make something up web design Co. And we'll say graphic designer. All right, then everything else we want the social icons, we want the footer, everything else is the same. Okay, so let's got all that. Yep, let's save this. Let's go into our sass file. Alright, we'll start with our about class. Let's add a padding on here to the bottom, we'll add to rim and then within here we have our about bio image. Here we'll set the height to 50 view height, the width will be 100%. And then we're going to do the same thing with background that we did in the home page here. So I'm going to copy this and paste that there. I think then on here, we'll have a will display as flex. And we'll set the flex direction to column, align items center and then justify content we're going to use flex and K now still within our about let's target the paragraph. That's the bio paragraph We'll set a margin. On the bottom there have to ram. Right, let's just see what we have so far. We'll save that. All right, we'll go to about me, it's already looking pretty good. So we set the view height to 50%. We've got the image back there with the overlay, we've got the title here, and the paragraph displaying is flex, set it to a column. And so that we can align center and then flex to the end. We still got a bit more to do here, we put that this, why does that say block end, margin bottom. Alright, so we put this two rim margin on the bottom, so it wouldn't go all the way to the, to the edge. Actually, here, this paragraph should have been here, so we have to be careful with nesting. nesting too much can become an issue. Didn't want to target all the paragraphs. So actually miss something here, we forgot to wrap this, we needed to wrap this in in about bio. Alright, so now let's target or I'm still within the about, we'll start at the about veyo. We'll set the width here to 80%. And then text align, center. And then I want to target the text secondary. So that's the heading, I could just target the heading directly. There's many different ways of doing things. But we're just targeting the text secondary, and I want to add a padding on that on the bottom of one rim. Alright, let's check that out. There. That's looking good. Alright, so now let's style our jobs. So still, within about we'll go to jobs. And then within there, let's set the width to 60 view width. So 60% of the view width of set a margin on here of two rim top, auto right, zero on the bottom on the left, we're going to display this as grid, we'll set the grid template columns to initially one fractional unit, and then the grid gap will set to two. So if you're not familiar with CSS Grid, I have a video on that as well check that out in my channel. Alright, let's see what we have so far. All right, looking better. Now within jobs. We have jobs job. So each job we're going to have a background. And we're going to lights and so we're going to use the primary color. And we're going to lighten it by 10%. And then we want a padding, we'll add point five REM all around, and then a border bottom we'll do five pixels, solid and secondary color. Alright, that's looking good. Um, everything's a little squished together. So within the job here, let's just go ahead and target the headings directly, we'll say h two and H three. We'll set those to a margin, top and bottom of point five rim and zero left and right. On the H six. I'm going to set the top and bottom a little bit less. So let's go point three, zero and left and right. There we go. That looks pretty good. Alright, so now notice, the social icons and the copyright are getting in the way a bit. All right, so let's go down here still within about let's target our social icons. And this time we were going to display these as flex and we want to set the flex direction to column. Alright, so now they're out of the way that looks good. And we need to do something with the footer now. So let's target the footer and we're going to transform will Start by rotating it, and we're going to rotate it 90 degrees. And we're going to translate or move it. The X value will be a negative three, rim and the y value will be a negative five rounds, I had to play around with these numbers as well. So there you go, we flipped, flipped it up and put it on its side. Now it's out of the way as well. All right, so that is it for this page, we'll get into the responsiveness once we're finished with all of our pages. Alright, so now let's move on to our projects page. So let me open the sidebar. And in this, let's add another file. And this is going to be projects dot html. And then let's go ahead and add our sass file as well, the partial underscore projects, dot SCSS. Alright, close the sidebar. And now, what we'll do here is let's just use the about let's copy everything from there into projects, and then we'll modify it. Alright, so we'll say Mike Smith projects. And let's take the active here, and let's put it on the projects link. Alright, so let's rename this to projects. And I'm actually going to have the image in here as well. So let's rename this to projects, bio image. And then within the bio image, I will delete this will add an h1 with a text, secondary class, and we'll say my projects. Alright, and then let's get rid of the jobs here. Alright, so now here, let's put a div with the class of projects. items should be projects, projects, items, and then projects, item items and then item, this time we're going to use an image. And the source is going to be image and then project one. For the alt, so I'll just put my projects right under this, we're going to have a div with the class of projects, projects, buttons. Alright, so we're gonna have an overlay over these, and there's going to be some buttons within the overlay. So in here, let's add a link, the class of projects button. And that's just not that's not going to go anywhere. And then we'll put an icon here. And it's going to be FA s, fa, I, oops, not gas, fa s. Alright, and then after that, let's say, preview, right, and then let's take this link, and we're going to Alt Shift Down Arrow, copy it, we want two links here. This one is going to be instead of I it's going to be GitHub. And actually he says as a brand, we have to change it to FA B for brand. And let's change this to GitHub. Alright, so that is one project. So let's highlight this and we're going to duplicate it, we have six total projects. So we're going to duplicate it five times. I'll Shift Down Arrow 12345. Alright, let's go back up to the first one. Right, here's the first one. And all we're going to change on these is the the project image. Everything else will stay the same. So 2345 and six, right and then everything after that the social icons, the footer, everything else will be the same. So let's save this. Let's go ahead and check that out. It's going to look up Yeah, okay, can't really tell what's going on there. So let's go to our sass. And the sass here is going to be pretty close to what's in the about CSS flow for the most part, the top part anyway, so let's just copy this and we'll make some adjustments. Alright, so this is going to be projects. padding bottom to ram is good image. This time, I want it to be 30, view height, background, all of that's good. Flex columns, center flex, and all of that's good. So here's where things will change up a bit, we'll take the paragraph out where to target the text secondary, and want the font size to be a bit bigger, set it to two rim and I want the margin on the bottom to run. Alright, and then we don't need this. Alright, so here, um, a lot of this is the same. So we'll change jobs to projects, items. So that's the wrapper. Or it's let's take the, let's take this part out. And then we also have projects item. So on the item, we're going to set the position to be relative, because we're going to need to absolutely position other items, we're going to set the border bottom to five pixels solid, and the secondary color. We want the overflow to be hidden. We'll talk about that in a minute. cursor pointer. Now within here we have the image. And we want the width on those to be 100%. Right now they're way off the page. Alright, let's, let's stop there. And let's see what we have. Well, I keep forgetting in our main sass, we need to import that. So let's import our projects. Save. Oh, that looks much better. Alright, let's get back over here to our sass file. So that's looking, okay, we're going to do something with these buttons. Now. Let's go in here, and we're going to create an overlay. This time, we're going to use a pseudo element. So we're going to use this is the project's item. And then we'll create an after we have our content, we'll set that to blank position here is going to be absolute. That's why we have the parent container set to relative. Alright, we're going to initially set the top at 100%. So that is going to push it all the way to the bottom initially is going to be under its element. And so that's the reason why we set the overflow to hidden that way we don't see it, because when we hover we want it to pull up from the bottom right, we're gonna set left to zero, set the height to 100% and the width to 100%. We're gonna set the background to the secondary color, and opacity initially, initially is going to be zero. And let's include our transition. Alright, that's looking good. No, that's really not going to do anything. And we'll save it, you'll see, it really looks the same because that item is hidden. So let's create a hover event here. So this is going to be the item and present, hover. And what we're going to do is on hover, we need to target the pseudo element. So that's going to be after we want the top to be zero instead of 100%. So that's going to put it back where it should go. And the opacity want to set it 2.09 I just want to barely see through it. All right, so let's save that. Now if we hover over it, there we go. It comes up from the bottom and becomes visible. Alright, so now we still have these buttons to deal with. Okay, so this so we're still in the Item. All right. And what we need is projects buttons. So projects is the main. So we're going to have to come down here and make sure that we're not under the item we're under the projects. So ampersand buttons, here, we're going to set a position of absolute. On the top is going to be zero, height of 100%, width of 100%. We set a z index of one, we're going to display these as a grid. So let's do our grid, template columns. And these will also always be in a two column layout. So we want the preview to be on the left and GitHub to be on the right. So we're going to use repeat, we're going to say repeat twice, one fractional unit. So that will make them equal. And we're going to align items to the center, and text align, center. Okay, let's save that. And now they're there. But I only want them to pop up when I hover. Let's target the individual buttons now. So projects button. Here, we're going to set the opacity to zero initially, set the color to the set text, oops, set text color. Based on the secondary, we want to base it off of the secondary because that's what's going to be behind it. Right, and then let's include our transition. And now we need a hover. So can present hover. On hover, I want the text color change. So we're going to say color. And let's see, we can do can do this. On orange, I think that's going to return a white. But when I hover over, I wanted to change the black just to show that that I'm hovering over it. And so I want it to be the opposite. So I know that this is white. So I can kind of a hack. But I can do, I can wrap that in another set text color. So that's going to set the text color against white, which is going to be black. Now what we need to do is I want the button to display when I hover over the project item. So in order to do that, I have to go to the project item here. And we'll go to our hover event. And after the pseudo element, we'll do projects button, and then we'll change the opacity to one. All right, let's save that. Let's see what we have. Okay, the hovers not working. Why is this set to column ruled? color? Sorry about that. All right, let's see. Okay, it was opposite. Alright. So initially, this is black. We want to hover over to changes to white. For the social icons in the footer, they're great. We're going to leave them just like that. All right, that's all looking good. So now let's look at the contacts page. We pull out the sidebar, and under dist. Let's create contact dot html. Let's go ahead and create our sass partial underscore contact.sc s s. Right, let's go ahead and in the main let's go ahead and add that before I forget. And that was contact. Alright, let's just let's use the project's HTML Copy that. We'll paste that in the contact and we'll say contact Mike Smith. Alright, and then let's change our active here to our Contact link. Change or section class to contact, and then everything within here, we can go ahead and remove. So we're going to add an h2 and we're just going to say contact me. Alright, then let's add a div with the class of contact list. And then we'll add a div with the class of contact, contact email. Within here, we'll have an icon, fa, S, fa envelope. And then we'll just say email there. And then we'll have a div with a class of text secondary. Within here, we'll put the email so we'll just say email, at email. com. Alright, so let's copy this down twice. Alright, and so we have an email, we also have phone. And that's going to be mobile, Alt, C phone, and this will just put a number in here. There we go. And then this last one is going to be address. And for that, we'll use the icon, marker, Alt, to say, we'll say address, and then just put a generic address 123 First Street, Houston, Texas. All right. Everything else past here, we're going to keep the same. Right, let's save that. Let's go to the contact page is going to be ugly. There we go. Alright, so let's go to our contact CSS. So from here, this one's going to be a lot like home. So let's just copy all of this from home. into here. change this to contact. Alright, so we're going to have a view height of 100% padding on the top 40 view height. Okay, so here, we're going to change this, we're going to display this as flex. And we're going to set the flex direction to column background is good, we're going to use that same thing. Alright. And so then everything up to this, we can take that out. So here, we're going to target the h2. And we're going to set the font size to three, REM and margin, bottom to REM. And then we're going to target the contact contact list. We're going to display this as grid. So get our grid template columns. And initially it's going to be set to one fractional unit. We want a grid gap to run and we're gonna change the font oops, and change the font size to 1.5 rim. Right and then yeah, let's let's save that. See what we have. Alright, that's looking. Okay, so far. Let's see, I think goodness something here. Flex column. Yeah, we need to align items center. There we go. So that is all of the pages. Let's go through. We've got our main page here. And then our about me. And projects looking good. All right, and then the contact. Actually, you know what I want to do on the contact, I want to change the social icons, I want them to be up here. So right here, let's do social icons. Let's change the position to initial and we'll set a margin top on there have to rim. Yeah, I like that better. It's all in the same spot to contact. Next we'll make this responsive. Alright, let's see what this looks like. Before we make any responsive changes, actually doesn't look terrible. But obviously, we don't want to have this menu. When we're at this size. Let's see the other pages. That actually doesn't look terrible either. But we'll make a few changes here, maybe make this text bigger. Let's check out projects. Oh, yeah, that's, that's too big. You know, we'll need to adjust that grid. And then we'll make these inline instead of stacked. Alright. So the first thing that we need to do is we'll go to our config in our sass file, and we will go and then at the bottom, we're going to include some mixins. So mixin. And we're going to create a mixin for for some media queries. So we'll start with a medium size. And so we're going to include in this mixin, a media screen. And we'll put a minimum width of 768. And then in here, we will put at content. So now when we call this mixin, whatever content will be will get passed into this media query. All right, so that's for the medium size, let's go ahead and just copy this down, Alt Shift down, we're going to create two more. So we're going to create a large, that is going to be 1024 pixels. And then we're going to create an extra large, and that will be anything over 1600 pixels. Alright, and let's save this. And let's start with, let's just go back to the homepage here. So what we're going to do is, we're going to create a new sass file. I'm going to name it underscore responsive, dot SCSS. Alright, and then let's go to our main s CSS, and let's include that. There we go. Save that. Now in our responsive, we're going to include our media queries, those mixins. So we're going to include media medium, we'll start with the smaller, smaller sizes and work our way up. So let's start with the menu. So menu button. At this size, we want the visibility to be hidden, and then our nav. We want the visibility of this to be visible. And then within the nav, we have our menu nav. And we need to make some alterations, because we don't want the full page now to come up, we want a nav bar at the top. So let's change this display here to block by default, it's fixed. And then we're going to transform and translate. Why? Because we had that all the way at the top. So now we need to put it back in its place. And then let's set a height here. To 100% that is available to it. Set the background currently it has the the dark gray background, the primary color, so we're going to set that to transparent. And then we're going to text the line to the right. Then within here we have our items. So that is menu nav item. And we need to display these in line. Right and then we're gonna add a padding on the right of 1.5 rim. Then we need to target the menu link. Then on the link, we're going to change the font size because we we made it bigger earlier. So by default, I think it was three REM so we're going to change it to 1.5 REM let's see what we have so far. We'll save that. Alright, now let's check it out. So we get over 768 Here we go. Nice. That looks good. All right. Let's See what we need to do on the about page? I think we'll just make this text a little bit bigger as we go. Yeah. Okay, so outside of. So we're still inside the media, the medium media query are outside of the nav. So we're going to add and about bio. And then let's change the font size to 1.5. REM, make it just a little bit bigger. All right, let's see. That looks good. Yep. All right. Let's look at the projects. So it's one column they're in, then yeah, we're gonna want to change that. So let's target projects. And then within the projects, I think it was the bio image. Yeah, the heights on there? Because let's see when we get. Yeah, let's get a little too close, I think. So let's change the height. So I think it was 50 initially, so let's go 40 view height. And then projects, items. Let's change the grid template columns. And we're going to change that to a repeat to have one fractional unit. Right? And then this, my projects would probably need to increase that a bit. So that was, so we could target the text secondary. I will change the font size there to three REM. Right. Let's save that and see what we have. Now that's that looks good. Right. don't think there's anything? Let's see. Let's go to contacts. Yeah, so let's, let's make this to let's add contacts, contact lists. And what the grid template columns, and we'll do the repeats to one of our on that one as well. All right, let's see. Yeah, that's good. All right. So that is on medium screens. So let's move on to the large screens, a couple of things that we're going to change here. So let's include that mix in media query. So include media, large, I think projects. Yeah, let's, let's make projects, let's turn projects into a three column at a large layout. So let's see where was that? We could take this. paste it here. Get rid of the bio image and close that out and change this to a three. That should work. Let's say that. All right, medium size to large size three. Yeah, that's good. All right. And then let's do the same thing for the contact. Let's change that to three. So I'll just copy this. Put it there and change that to three. Save it. To There we go. That looks pretty good. It looks good. All right. And then the last part. Let's see, let's go to projects. So you're right in this area, the image is getting too close. So I want to increase the height on this on an extra large screen. So let's go to our last mixin. That's the large media query. So let's include the extra large And so let's hear that was project's bio image. And then let's change the height to 50 v H. There we go. That looks good. Right? And then, let's see, we could make this have a fourth column, possibly, but I think it looks good. So let's go through it real quick. We've got the main screen looks good on a big screen and go down to a small screen looks good as well, we have our menu, right? Let's go to our about me, that looks good. Let's go to a larger screen. Now I could take these and turn them into columns as well. But I like the way that they're stacked because of the years. So current is on top, and then it goes down. So I'm just gonna leave this as a column, I think it looks better. And then projects, we already looked at that that looks good. And then contact. So that that looks good as well. Nice. Alright, so let's talk about deploying this. So we're gonna deploy this today on GitHub Pages, we could also use natla phi, that's another good one. But I went ahead and uploaded the project to GitHub. And if you're not familiar with Git and GitHub, I have a video on that as well, you can check out on my channel, but it's very simple. So I've got this uploaded, and we're going to go to Settings. And then if you just scroll down to the GitHub Pages portion, just set this to the master branch. Alright, let's scroll back down. And now it says your site is ready to be published. So we could set a custom domain if we want. I'm just gonna leave the default there. So now if we go here, and go to dist, there we go. So this is live on the internet now. So that's gonna be it for this video. If you stick around to the end. Thank you for watching.
