00:00 - autodesk revit is a building information
00:02 - modeling software for architects
00:04 - engineers and designers in this
00:06 - university course you will learn how to
00:08 - use revit for 3d modeling and design
00:11 - so this one is going to be focused on
00:13 - giving you the basis
00:15 - for working in revit
00:18 - so i'm going to
00:20 - probably record three videos three
00:22 - tutorial videos just showing from start
00:24 - to finish how to produce a very very
00:26 - simple
00:27 - very very basic project in revit so
00:32 - the course itself has a website of
00:35 - course and
00:36 - as
00:38 - long students you already have seen the
00:40 - course those of you who are not fluent
00:43 - students can also kind of jump in
00:47 - jump into the website by just
00:51 - writing down this this address here
00:54 - and in the course we have a lot of
00:57 - information here but that's not not
00:59 - not that important what's important is
01:03 - um
01:05 - where is it oh my god i will need to
01:08 - re-format
01:10 - this uh what's important is what kind of
01:13 - a
01:14 - client you're going to choose your your
01:16 - fictional client for for the project and
01:18 - also uh this
01:20 - supplementary material right so we will
01:23 - not be starting from scratch we will be
01:26 - using a 3d model that i've made
01:29 - um to get you guys started to just have
01:32 - some sort of a environment ready
01:36 - for us to model in
01:37 - so
01:39 - there are these two
01:40 - links here site 3d model and sat format
01:43 - and site 3d model in rhino 5 format the
01:46 - reason i use rhino5 is because
01:50 - i just make sure that everyone can
01:52 - follow along you know with the older
01:53 - version of rhino
01:56 - so
01:57 - i have already kind of made it and
02:00 - downloaded it and so on once you do that
02:02 - and you open it up you will see
02:04 - [Music]
02:06 - this 3d model right here
02:08 - so the task of the course is going to be
02:11 - um to
02:13 - 3d model out some sort of a building
02:16 - in between these two
02:18 - so it's you know it's it's kind of a
02:19 - challenge it's it's quite a narrow one
02:22 - and these are called narrow buildings
02:23 - for a reason right
02:25 - um
02:27 - right so
02:28 - we will
02:30 - let's just take a
02:32 - closer look at it in arctic view
02:35 - there's nothing fancy i believe i just
02:37 - extracted some dwg file from uh lund
02:41 - city
02:42 - um
02:43 - and just modeled out a few few buildings
02:45 - from that dwg file
02:50 - so
02:52 - we are now looking in rhino but this
02:54 - course is about revit so let's stop
02:56 - looking at it in rhino and rather let's
02:59 - look at it in revit so in revit
03:02 - once you open up revit you will be
03:04 - presented with this
03:06 - window here
03:08 - um and
03:10 - basically it's asking you to create a
03:11 - new file right to start working so we
03:14 - will do exactly that i will click on
03:16 - new models new
03:19 - and here it's going to ask me what kind
03:21 - of
03:22 - template do i want to use and it
03:25 - asks you whether or not you would like
03:27 - to use imperial units or metric units
03:30 - so i will be using metric of course
03:34 - in sweden we do use metric system
03:37 - um
03:38 - and if you don't see it here you can
03:40 - always click on browse
03:45 - and then expand the top
03:47 - bar here
03:49 - go back to
03:50 - uh templates
03:52 - so 1 1 4 up or
03:55 - so to say
03:57 - and here you will see
03:59 - english or
04:00 - we just
04:02 - ah let's go for
04:05 - english
04:07 - default metric we can use that one
04:10 - so it's it's either one
04:12 - you matter
04:14 - i'll use default metric that that seems
04:17 - fine i'll just hit open
04:19 - yep sure hit ok
04:21 - and it's going to load up a new file for
04:24 - us
04:26 - once that's done i will immediately save
04:28 - it
04:29 - just so that auto saving kicks in and if
04:33 - it crashes or anything like that i don't
04:35 - lose a lot of information so i'll go to
04:38 - file save as
04:43 - oh can i just save i'll save yeah i can
04:46 - just save well
04:48 - here i'll just save it to my desktop
04:50 - because i don't have a folder for it
04:53 - ada15
04:56 - tutorials
04:58 - sure
04:59 - hit save
05:01 - that's it so so you're done with that
05:04 - right so let's start with me showing you
05:07 - the user interface or either kind of
05:09 - quickly going through the user interface
05:12 - so here in in the right and the top we
05:15 - have a few mostly used
05:19 - shortcut buttons
05:20 - such as open file save file plot undo
05:23 - redo
05:25 - check dimension and so on right
05:28 - so those are kind of handy
05:31 - but i don't tend to use them that often
05:34 - if i need to save something i'll just
05:36 - click on this file tab and just choose
05:38 - to save here i don't know why but
05:40 - that's just how i do it
05:43 - and here right below those shortcut
05:46 - buttons you have your tabs your tabs
05:49 - where
05:50 - all of the tools
05:52 - in revit are located
05:55 - so
05:56 - i already showed you the
05:58 - file tab well it's not really a tab but
06:00 - the file button here
06:02 - for opening a new file
06:04 - or creating a new file opening up a file
06:06 - existing one saving all all of that good
06:09 - stuff
06:10 - um so that's not interesting but what's
06:13 - interesting is these
06:14 - tool tabs here we have architecture we
06:17 - will be using quite a bit of it of the
06:20 - tools in architecture tab of course
06:23 - uh this is like the main one
06:25 - structure tab
06:27 - uh we will almost
06:29 - not be wait let me see no we will not be
06:32 - using anything from the structure tab
06:35 - even though it's it's super for for
06:38 - engineering purposes but since this is
06:40 - just uh
06:41 - like a proposal level
06:44 - entry-level project that we're doing
06:47 - we don't really need needed
06:49 - then we have steel precast and systems
06:52 - tabs all of these are engineering
06:54 - related we don't care
06:56 - about them insert tab basically lets you
06:58 - import
06:59 - or insert stuff that's not native to
07:03 - revit such as dwg files and
07:06 - and whatnot images
07:08 - we will be using a little bit of it
07:10 - annotate tab
07:12 - um actually quite useful i'm not sure if
07:14 - we will be using it though
07:16 - maybe text we will see but annotate is
07:19 - basically dimensions text
07:23 - tags
07:24 - symbols all of that good stuff is in the
07:26 - annotate tab
07:28 - analyze we will not be using that
07:30 - messing inside
07:32 - um
07:33 - [Music]
07:36 - in this case uh for this particular
07:39 - course i'm not sure if we are going to
07:42 - be using it
07:43 - but in aada
07:47 - 20 in the next course
07:49 - i believe we will
07:51 - so you'll need to wait for that
07:54 - collaborate basically it helps you
07:57 - if you're working in a team uh tools
08:00 - here
08:00 - help you
08:02 - collaborate with other people working on
08:04 - the same project
08:05 - quite a strong tool
08:08 - uh but given the situation of of code
08:11 - and not not being able
08:13 - all of us not being able to be in the
08:15 - school
08:16 - uh we will be skipping skipping this
08:20 - tab right here
08:21 - view tab quite
08:23 - um yeah we will be using it quite quite
08:25 - a bit
08:26 - um basically just is used to make
08:29 - sections to extract 3d views elevations
08:32 - and also changing the the graphics of
08:35 - the drawings themselves
08:38 - i will be revisiting it quite a bit
08:41 - manage add-ins and modify
08:44 - um these three tabs we will not be using
08:47 - that much well modify tab you will
08:49 - notice when we will be
08:52 - [Music]
08:53 - double clicking on or changing some sort
08:55 - of geometry modify tab will
08:57 - automatically open up with additional
09:00 - uh tools
09:02 - uh that that can be used for that
09:04 - precise geometry for instance if you
09:06 - create a floor slab and you want to edit
09:09 - the boundary of the of the floor slab
09:13 - uh then you
09:15 - um
09:16 - i believe double click it or click on
09:18 - edit i don't remember
09:20 - i'm not a revit user by the way
09:23 - um but it will open up the modify tab
09:26 - where you will have
09:27 - additional tools available for you to
09:30 - modify the boundary of the floor
09:33 - you'll see that in action in just a
09:35 - second okay so that's all about the tabs
09:38 - then here on the left hand side you have
09:41 - the the properties
09:44 - so these are the properties of every
09:47 - piece of geometry that there is if that
09:51 - you have selected right
09:53 - if you don't have anything selected that
09:56 - means
09:57 - the the properties will show you
10:00 - uh the settings for the view itself
10:03 - and in this case we are in level one
10:06 - so we're looking at the top of for for
10:09 - level one that's that's our view and
10:11 - it's basically the properties or the
10:13 - settings for that particular view
10:17 - uh once we have some geometry in here i
10:19 - will talk about the properties a little
10:20 - bit more
10:22 - uh then we have our
10:24 - project browser
10:26 - which is basically all of our views all
10:29 - of our floor plans and so on are going
10:30 - to be located here so right now since we
10:33 - loaded up the
10:35 - default
10:36 - template
10:38 - uh it already has a few
10:41 - a few views set up for us and actually
10:43 - it has too many
10:45 - so we don't need that many views right
10:47 - now
10:48 - and what i'm going to do is i will
10:50 - probably get rid of
10:52 - yeah let's get rid of them so for
10:54 - instance ceiling plants we don't really
10:56 - need any ceiling plants whatsoever so
10:59 - i'll just
11:00 - single click to select level one and hit
11:03 - delete
11:04 - single click to select just make sure
11:06 - that you are deleting ceiling plants not
11:09 - the floor plans right i select level two
11:12 - delete don't need those
11:14 - as for elevations we will be creating
11:16 - our own elevations so we don't really
11:18 - need that as well so i'll delete the
11:20 - east north south
11:23 - west elevations as well
11:26 - all right so now
11:29 - we we only see level one level two and
11:32 - site actually level two
11:34 - i'll get rid of that as well
11:37 - okay so now we only have level one and
11:39 - site uh two two plants
11:43 - i want to import
11:46 - my
11:47 - geometry into the model right
11:50 - sorry my geometry by my geometry i mean
11:52 - the surrounding environment into this
11:55 - revit model
11:57 - to actually have something to work work
11:59 - with
12:00 - to do that i will go to
12:04 - uh insert
12:06 - i'll choose to import
12:08 - cad
12:10 - right
12:11 - import cad
12:13 - which is going to basically ask me
12:15 - where's the model and what kind of
12:17 - format
12:18 - should i use so as you can see here it
12:21 - does accept rhino files which is great
12:24 - we we can use the the rhino file aeda15
12:29 - site
12:30 - that's fine
12:31 - or
12:33 - if that
12:34 - gives you an error sometimes it does
12:36 - just to be safe
12:38 - uh there's also an option to import sat
12:41 - file acis sat file
12:43 - um so that sat file is also located
12:49 - let me just
12:50 - add right here
12:53 - site 3d model in set format
12:57 - so if rhino gives you problems importing
13:00 - rhino gives you problems just import the
13:01 - sat file uh i'll import the set file i
13:04 - guess so i'll select that select the set
13:07 - file that i have downloaded
13:10 - um
13:11 - blah blah blah
13:13 - import as category
13:16 - so that's an important one
13:19 - basically in
13:20 - revit
13:22 - every piece of geometry belongs to a
13:25 - geometry category right so revit needs
13:29 - to to know what kind of geometry is it
13:32 - is it a column is it a ceiling is it a
13:34 - door
13:36 - you know what what is it
13:38 - so here uh
13:40 - our site model is neither one of those
13:43 - things right
13:44 - so we will be importing it is
13:47 - it as a generic model
13:50 - so i'll hit on open
13:54 - generic model is basically
13:57 - yeah just anything
14:00 - geometry that doesn't have a type
14:03 - and it seems like it's import it has
14:06 - been imported
14:09 - good enough
14:10 - seems like it's fine
14:12 - okay so we have our geometry here
14:15 - that's great
14:16 - and we have these doodads
14:18 - right here
14:20 - which we don't really need so these are
14:22 - leftovers from where we had the
14:25 - elevations
14:27 - elevation views these were markers for
14:29 - elevation views i think i'll just delete
14:31 - them
14:33 - delete delete
14:35 - so i'm just selecting them uh just click
14:37 - delete
14:40 - click delete if you don't have them
14:42 - that's even better
14:44 - okay so we have our top view of our
14:48 - generic model
14:50 - that's cool and all but we kind of want
14:52 - to
14:53 - uh also see it in 3d right
14:56 - no just to
14:58 - understand uh
15:00 - how well did it import so to do that we
15:03 - can go to view
15:05 - and we can create view tab and we can
15:08 - create 3d view
15:12 - that's it
15:13 - that's all we needed to do
15:16 - um so
15:18 - now on to how do we navigate in the
15:20 - viewport in the 3d viewport in revit so
15:23 - you do it by holding down the shift key
15:26 - and clicking the scroll wheel
15:28 - clicking and dragging the scroll wheel
15:30 - you can rotate
15:32 - if you just click and drag the scroll
15:34 - wheel you pan
15:37 - scroll wheel
15:46 - right now there's not a lot of things
15:48 - going on here nothing too fancy
15:51 - um but that's fine
15:54 - all right so we have our 3d model here
15:58 - and let's start creating some or rather
16:00 - preparing to create some
16:02 - um
16:04 - some geometries
16:06 - so what i like doing is
16:08 - oh by the way sorry every view that you
16:10 - open will be
16:12 - shown here in these tabs so you can
16:14 - easily switch between them or you can
16:16 - just double click on the
16:18 - on the name of the view here level one
16:22 - uh
16:23 - so in revit you always work
16:27 - not always but most of the time you work
16:29 - in plan views like um what would be a
16:32 - good example
16:36 - like in sims
16:38 - like in that video game sims
16:41 - um
16:42 - you kind of work in plan view and the 3d
16:44 - view is just represent it it becomes
16:47 - like a representation of that so all of
16:49 - the drawing and
16:54 - drawing of walls and whatnot is done in
16:57 - plan view
16:58 - so in level one
17:01 - okay so let's start off by
17:04 - actually
17:06 - giving it a few axes
17:10 - that's at least what i like to do in
17:11 - this case it doesn't really make a lot
17:13 - of sense but i still like to do it just
17:15 - to keep it clean so i'll go to
17:18 - architecture tab
17:20 - and i'll choose grid here
17:23 - grid
17:25 - bam
17:26 - and as you can see immediately once i
17:28 - chose the grid option
17:31 - it gives me
17:32 - it it takes me to modify tab
17:36 - where it basically asks us
17:39 - how would you like to place the grid
17:41 - where would you like to place the grid
17:43 - axis
17:44 - so i will do that
17:47 - by just clicking on these endpoints and
17:49 - the snapping is kind of kind of nice in
17:52 - revit
17:55 - so i'll click on one of the corners of
17:56 - the surrounding buildings and i'll drag
17:58 - out the grid
18:00 - line here
18:02 - that's our first grid line and i'll do
18:04 - the same thing for the second one
18:07 - from here
18:09 - to here and align them perfect
18:13 - so that's our
18:15 - grid axis one and grid axis two
18:18 - um i could do grid axis three and four
18:21 - maybe we should
18:23 - so grid axis three
18:26 - um i wonder
18:29 - should it should we do it here
18:32 - or should we do it
18:34 - here
18:38 - let's do it here
18:39 - so that's our grid axis three oh come on
18:42 - there we go
18:43 - and that's going to be our grid access
18:45 - form
18:48 - bam
18:49 - done
18:51 - once you've done that you just hit
18:52 - escape
18:54 - [Music]
18:56 - that's all that's all
18:57 - right so now i will just clean them up a
19:00 - little bit
19:01 - so i'll click on this uh arrow key here
19:04 - or i believe i can just hit escape once
19:06 - more
19:07 - um and then it will automatically go to
19:10 - my arrow key
19:11 - or arrow
19:13 - tool
19:14 - i'll select let's say grid access three
19:17 - and i'll add
19:19 - this this markup three i will add it
19:22 - to the other side as well right here
19:26 - three
19:27 - so let me do that again you select grid
19:30 - access three and there's a tick mark box
19:32 - on the other side
19:35 - right which you tick and then it's
19:37 - basically it understands that oh okay i
19:39 - need to show
19:40 - uh the grid axis
19:42 - okay that's good
19:44 - for grid access for we do the same thing
19:47 - we find that tick box here sometimes
19:50 - it's hard to see it
19:52 - of course it starts auto saving
19:57 - let's wait there we go
19:59 - red x is four
20:00 - then there same thing for axis one and
20:03 - same thing for axis 2.
20:06 - let me drag them out a little bit so
20:09 - that it's
20:11 - nice and tidy
20:15 - there we go
20:20 - up
20:22 - there we go i might need to squish the
20:24 - scooch
20:25 - grid axis three and four closer uh to
20:28 - the to the building but that's gonna be
20:30 - done later
20:32 - for now this is good enough um
20:35 - so in architecture you don't really have
20:38 - a grid axis going in both directions
20:41 - being marked
20:43 - in numbers so if in one direction grid
20:46 - axes are marked in numbers one two three
20:48 - four five and the other one they're
20:51 - going to be marked in letters a b c d
20:54 - blah blah blah
20:55 - so here for grid access three
20:59 - where it says name
21:01 - let me do that again maybe it's a little
21:03 - bit too fast i'll select grid axis 3 and
21:06 - i'll say that no this is not 3 this is a
21:09 - so i select it
21:12 - once i selected the properties changes
21:14 - and here where it says name i will just
21:16 - change this to a
21:18 - hit apply
21:21 - very good
21:22 - same thing for a grid access 4. instead
21:25 - of 4 i change this to b
21:29 - there we go
21:30 - okay so now we are all set we are all
21:33 - set to start uh start
21:37 - making our
21:38 - building
21:40 - right so
21:42 - before um
21:44 - i wonder which which
21:48 - yeah let's start with walls right
21:50 - i think we should start with walls
21:53 - um
21:55 - so to to add a wall there is this wall
21:57 - tool the
21:59 - of course it's under architecture tab
22:01 - wall
22:02 - if i expand it i can see that there are
22:06 - a few options here but for now we don't
22:08 - care about those options we just care
22:10 - about the regular wall tool right so i
22:13 - will not be expanding that that tool
22:17 - i'll click on the wall tool
22:19 - and
22:20 - before i start just going to town
22:22 - drawing it i will
22:25 - choose instead of having basic wall
22:27 - generic 200 millimeters
22:30 - i will choose
22:32 - a thicker one actually the one that that
22:35 - we should be using
22:37 - is like
22:40 - 400 500 millimeters
22:44 - but we don't have it in in this
22:48 - drop down list
22:49 - so i will probably just
22:52 - just say yeah screw it let's do 300
22:55 - millimeters
22:56 - who cares
22:58 - right but usually you when working in an
23:01 - office you do have
23:03 - a library that office itself has a
23:06 - library of walls that
23:08 - that office uses right
23:11 - um and and then you can just choose from
23:13 - from that library here it's just generic
23:15 - stuff so
23:17 - yeah sure we will just use generic stuff
23:20 - so 300 millimeters it is
23:23 - um i believe in
23:26 - in sweden it's it's
23:28 - right now the regulation is around
23:31 - you can't get away with walls that are
23:34 - thinner
23:35 - than
23:37 - around 500 millimeters
23:40 - due to heat insulation being so so thick
23:43 - but i might be wrong about that
23:47 - at least at least in the baltic region
23:49 - it's it's 500 millimeters
23:52 - but 300 is fine here um okay so we have
23:56 - our wall type then we have our location
23:59 - line and also it's it's kind of
24:02 - the
24:03 - mostly used settings are kind of here
24:07 - in the in the top row
24:09 - uh where it basically asks for what kind
24:11 - of height the wall should have
24:14 - um
24:15 - what's the location of the line so let
24:17 - me explain how how that works so
24:21 - to determine
24:23 - height of the wall
24:26 - let's do
24:28 - unconnected
24:29 - right
24:31 - so it's it's height and it's unconnected
24:34 - right
24:37 - and the the unconnected height from
24:40 - level one upwards
24:42 - here is set to be eight hundred eight
24:45 - thousand millimeters so eight meters
24:47 - right
24:48 - um
24:50 - and so that's fine that's fine for us
24:52 - right now because i'm just showing you
24:54 - how it works
24:56 - um
24:57 - but the nice thing about it is that you
24:59 - can have it connected to
25:01 - the second floor right so if you change
25:04 - the height of the second floor the
25:06 - height of the wall will change as well i
25:08 - will show that in just a second
25:10 - uh for now let's have it unconnected
25:12 - eight 000
25:14 - location of the line center line
25:17 - so if it's center line and i start
25:19 - drawing a wall you can see that it draws
25:23 - as if that that line through which i
25:25 - draw the wall is right in the middle of
25:27 - the wall so i don't really need that i
25:30 - don't really want that
25:31 - um i want the wall to go inwards here
25:35 - right
25:36 - so instead of a center line i will say
25:40 - finish face exterior
25:44 - right
25:46 - and then i'll start start drawing the
25:49 - wall as if it's
25:52 - not as if but i will start drawing the
25:55 - wall clockwise so
25:59 - that the exterior is is is on the
26:01 - outside
26:03 - like that
26:06 - like that
26:07 - so i'm just kind of snapping it
26:11 - that's it right we have we have our wall
26:15 - if i check it in 3d
26:20 - i kind of look at it
26:22 - that's our wall that we just drew
26:25 - and it's exactly eight meters high right
26:29 - let me jump back to level one
26:31 - you just uh see
26:33 - a few more uh a few more settings that
26:36 - that can be changed so
26:39 - let me
26:40 - delete that
26:44 - all together
26:46 - um grab the wall tool again
26:48 - um
26:49 - and and continue on with with the
26:52 - with the settings so here we have a
26:56 - chain chain is basically once you
26:58 - finished drawing one segment of the wall
27:01 - it will ask you to continue drawing the
27:04 - other segment and then the other and
27:06 - then the other right so it chains
27:08 - segments of the wall
27:09 - like a polyline it basically works like
27:12 - a polyline rather than a line tool
27:15 - offset is basically
27:17 - let's say 250 ml offset from where we
27:20 - draw
27:22 - and that's
27:24 - the bad offset
27:25 - let's say offset minus 250 to the other
27:29 - side
27:32 - so you can see it draws the wall
27:37 - with an offset of 250 millimeters from
27:40 - our reference line
27:43 - so that's uh sometimes
27:45 - handy uh this time it's not so let me
27:49 - yeah okay so offset
27:51 - um
27:52 - resets itself to zero if you escape out
27:55 - of the tool
27:57 - radius um have no idea what the radius
28:00 - is
28:01 - we can actually check
28:05 - yeah
28:06 - it's a little bit laggy ah okay so
28:09 - radius is basically a fillet of the wall
28:13 - so we don't really care about the radius
28:17 - at least for for for my example i will
28:20 - not be using any fillet
28:23 - corners
28:24 - and joint status allow or disallow it's
28:26 - basically when you make a corner of two
28:29 - walls do you want them to merge into one
28:33 - uh one geometry
28:35 - or not geometry but would should all of
28:38 - the
28:39 - layers inside of the walls kind of merge
28:41 - together nicely
28:43 - so i always have it set to be allowed
28:47 - all right let's actually do do something
28:50 - let's draw something because this is
28:51 - getting boring so i'll go to the website
28:56 - and here i will just quickly read that
28:59 - um we have three clients to choose from
29:02 - right annabelle which is an arts curator
29:05 - uh brian which is a car enthusiast or
29:09 - clementine which is a musician and
29:13 - i think i will go for animal
29:17 - in in for this particular tutorial just
29:19 - because i don't a
29:21 - or annabelle
29:24 - um and b for brian
29:26 - huh
29:27 - so
29:29 - annabelle is an arts curator and is
29:31 - looking to expand her gallery she wants
29:33 - the ground floor of her house to be open
29:35 - to public and should work as a small art
29:38 - gallery exhibition area she will live
29:40 - above this gallery so all other floors
29:42 - need to be private
29:44 - okay her stylistic
29:46 - preference is minimalist which with
29:49 - occasional strong color accents
29:52 - she has
29:53 - she has a cat no family so that will
29:55 - help us determine
29:58 - the the the living room or bedroom area
30:02 - and and so on
30:04 - okay
30:06 - uh first floor public second floor
30:08 - private uh
30:10 - gallery in the first floor um all other
30:13 - floors are living spaces
30:15 - easy
30:16 - let's jump back to revit
30:19 - and let's let's plan this out so
30:22 - you have a street here right
30:24 - and you have people walking along and
30:27 - you have
30:28 - you want this area to be the arts
30:30 - gallery right so i will say
30:35 - i will say
30:38 - the arts gallery itself
30:41 - is going to be or rather the entrance is
30:43 - going to be pushed in a little bit from
30:46 - the street so that there can be
30:48 - like a small gathering before an arts
30:52 - exhibition opening or something like
30:54 - that people like to go outside and smoke
30:56 - and have a chat and not stay indoors
30:59 - that much so you do need a little bit of
31:02 - space in the front right you don't want
31:04 - them to just be standing here on the
31:06 - street so i will be
31:08 - insetting
31:10 - this uh this building a little bit
31:12 - inwards
31:14 - uh to do that i need one more grid line
31:16 - because i like to keep things tidy so i
31:19 - will choose my grid tool here
31:22 - and instead of
31:23 - drawing the grid line
31:26 - i will do one
31:29 - one fancy
31:30 - not fancy but one additional like thing
31:33 - with it which is
31:35 - instead of here instead of drawing a
31:38 - line a grid line
31:40 - from point to point oh by the way sorry
31:42 - forgot when you hover your mouse over a
31:44 - tool it will show you what that tool
31:46 - does very handy
31:48 - um
31:49 - i will choose this tool right here pick
31:52 - lines
31:54 - the clients will help me determine from
31:56 - where do i
31:58 - from which line do i create
32:00 - a new grid line right
32:03 - and then i will say
32:05 - that actually
32:06 - i will
32:07 - my plan is to pick line b this this grid
32:10 - line here
32:12 - right
32:13 - come on
32:15 - okay it doesn't let me but that's fine
32:16 - it at least it lets me pick the the
32:19 - street
32:20 - uh straight line that's fine as well so
32:22 - i will be using this line here and i
32:25 - will be offsetting it inwards by
32:29 - i don't know 1.5 meters something like
32:31 - that
32:32 - i think 1.5 should should do the trick
32:37 - yeah let's do 1.5 ish
32:40 - uh meters so
32:43 - i am picking the line with this tool and
32:45 - here when where it says offset i will
32:48 - choose 1500
32:51 - for the offset right
32:53 - and then i just pick this line and
32:54 - already
32:55 - without clicking it already shows me
32:58 - where it's going to place the line if i
33:00 - want to place it on the other side by
33:01 - the way i can
33:03 - i can just type in minus 1500 and it's
33:06 - going to place it on the other side
33:09 - okay
33:10 - so click
33:11 - that's it
33:12 - create a third
33:14 - um
33:15 - [Music]
33:18 - why is there's uh
33:21 - no no no no no no sorry about that
33:25 - for some reason there there was um
33:29 - grid line d as well i don't want that
33:32 - again grid
33:33 - quick line
33:35 - 1
33:36 - 500
33:38 - um
33:39 - [Music]
33:41 - come on down okay there we go so now i
33:44 - just created one gridline that there was
33:46 - a
33:47 - i explained it to too much
33:49 - and i made too many gridlines um right
33:53 - so we have that oh right that's why
33:55 - that's because i keep clicking on it
33:57 - without actually
33:59 - looking that i'm still creating
34:01 - gridlines so this is how you can create
34:04 - gridlines quite fast with that offset
34:07 - offset tool but we don't need that so i
34:09 - will just be deleting all of these
34:12 - and i'll be just looking at gridline e
34:15 - which i'll pull back
34:18 - i'll pull back this one here
34:21 - create a tick mark uh not
34:23 - put the tick mark down
34:25 - red line e that's actually not e that is
34:28 - the new b
34:30 - grid line
34:31 - i wonder if it's going to let me do that
34:33 - no it doesn't i first need to change the
34:35 - grid line b here
34:37 - to c
34:39 - and this one is going to be gridline
34:42 - there we go
34:44 - we're good
34:45 - okay so that's going to be the
34:49 - inset of my
34:52 - um
34:53 - of my floor not my floor but off of my
34:56 - first floor
34:57 - walls
34:59 - let's actually let's create the walls
35:01 - right
35:02 - so bam walls
35:04 - uh finish face exterior great chain
35:07 - great let's just do it bam bam
35:11 - bam
35:12 - bam bam and yes i know it's right now
35:15 - unconnected but we are fine with that
35:19 - okay
35:20 - so we have done that right
35:23 - and if i take a look at it in 3d view
35:28 - bam there we go
35:32 - [Music]
35:33 - we have our
35:38 - our walls uh here shown and they are
35:41 - exactly eight meters high which is way
35:43 - too much but that's that's okay we'll
35:45 - fix that by the way if you don't like
35:47 - this
35:48 - wireframe view
35:50 - it's not wireframe line uh hidden line
35:52 - view
35:57 - if you don't like this hidden line view
35:58 - you can always go here to the
36:00 - oh wait
36:03 - there we go
36:04 - you can always go here to the bottom
36:07 - of the window and click on visual style
36:11 - hidden line here and choose shaded for
36:14 - instance and then you'll see the shaded
36:16 - view i just prefer to keep it
36:19 - clean at the start so i just use the
36:21 - hidden line view
36:24 - okay
36:26 - we have that done
36:28 - so now
36:29 - i want to
36:31 - actually create
36:34 - um
36:35 - actually connect sorry not create but
36:37 - actually connect
36:38 - these walls to level two right so that
36:41 - if i need to for some reason change the
36:44 - height of level two i can
36:47 - layer down the line
36:49 - so i will do that by
36:51 - first of all i need to create level two
36:53 - because here i only have level one right
36:56 - the ground floor level
36:58 - uh so i need to create level two and the
37:00 - way you do it
37:01 - is by actually um
37:05 - describing it or marking it out in the
37:08 - elevation view or in a section view
37:11 - so to do that first of all we need to
37:13 - create a section view or an elevation
37:16 - view and this is where
37:18 - actually creating views
37:20 - before the design starts
37:23 - start uh actually makes sense right um
37:27 - so let's do that
37:29 - um i will go to view
37:32 - here view
37:33 - and i'll choose
37:35 - to create an elevation view actually
37:37 - i'll make two of them one for the back
37:40 - side of the building and one for the
37:42 - front side right so elevation
37:46 - click
37:47 - that's in the view tab elevation click
37:51 - and it's basically asks me would i like
37:54 - to attach it to a grid and not not
37:56 - really i don't really care about
37:58 - attaching it to the grid i'll just do
38:00 - something like this
38:02 - right place it like that and it
38:05 - immediately looks at the
38:08 - [Music]
38:10 - at the facade that i've made and i'll do
38:12 - the same thing for
38:14 - the side here
38:18 - maybe a little bit further down there we
38:20 - go
38:23 - so we have two elevations here
38:26 - one and two
38:28 - and i can actually rename them as well
38:32 - sorry
38:33 - i first want to move move this bad boy
38:36 - away
38:38 - so these are basically the points from
38:40 - which we start looking at elevations or
38:42 - rather elevation markers
38:44 - um i will select
38:47 - my table
38:53 - sorry my table is falling apart okay so
38:56 - i will select one of them and i'll just
38:58 - take a look at what what can be what can
39:01 - be done with it so there are two ways of
39:03 - how you can select it first one is let
39:05 - me zoom in first
39:07 - first way to select it is if you select
39:09 - the circle right if you select the
39:11 - circle there's not much that you can
39:14 - that you can change here
39:16 - right you can kind of add a type
39:19 - and and
39:20 - choose a different
39:23 - and you even choose
39:25 - yeah you can kind of choose a different
39:28 - style for for this markup but other than
39:30 - that nothing else
39:33 - um
39:34 - well you can add more elevations from
39:36 - that point but we don't care about it
39:39 - uh yes please delete it okay um
39:44 - but what we do care about
39:46 - is this little arrow here
39:48 - this black arrow once we select the
39:51 - arrow
39:53 - then we have a lot of things that are
39:56 - going on first of which if we zoom out
39:58 - we can see this box here
40:01 - uh partially dashed line box partially
40:03 - blue line box that's uh that has
40:05 - appeared so this box right here
40:09 - basically tells us how wide
40:12 - the elevation is going to be
40:15 - right that view that we are going to
40:17 - generate
40:18 - how wide is it going to be
40:21 - so i'm going to take that
40:23 - and i'm going to push it to be quite
40:26 - narrow
40:27 - up until here
40:30 - and quite narrow up until here right
40:33 - because that's all we need
40:34 - we just need it to be there
40:37 - and
40:38 - so so that's the width and these two
40:41 - arrows here are the depth
40:44 - so if i click and drag on those
40:47 - i can say that i actually want to see
40:51 - it in my elevation view i want to see
40:53 - the background building if it's going to
40:56 - show up but i do want to see it right
40:59 - so i am kind of
41:00 - describing how far we are going to see
41:04 - that's one i'll do the same thing for
41:07 - the other one
41:10 - i'll change the width
41:14 - like that
41:16 - and the length
41:18 - like that should be good enough you can
41:21 - change the length
41:22 - uh
41:23 - any way you want as long as you know you
41:26 - show the stuff that you want to show
41:28 - um
41:29 - i will just rename them because i think
41:31 - that's that's kind of important
41:34 - so let me just see which one is which
41:37 - actually
41:40 - uh yeah it will from time to time it
41:42 - will ask you to
41:44 - save the project sure i will just click
41:46 - on save and here i just double clicked
41:49 - on elevation 2a
41:53 - and i'll just drag it out
41:56 - so
41:56 - sorry i i'm doing it automatically
42:00 - sorry
42:01 - um
42:02 - when you have uh double clicked on
42:05 - either elevation one a or elevation two
42:08 - a doesn't matter
42:10 - once you double clicked on them uh for
42:12 - the first time they will generate the
42:14 - view right so once the view has been
42:17 - generated it's going to kind of load up
42:19 - faster
42:20 - um and let's say elevation one a
42:24 - you can see this border that's clipping
42:27 - out
42:28 - or clipping away our
42:31 - view
42:34 - so i will select that border
42:37 - and i will drag
42:40 - on these these dots here i i'm able to
42:42 - drag it so that i can see more
42:47 - of this border
42:49 - or within this border
42:51 - like that and the width i will not be
42:54 - messing around too much with the width
42:58 - that's fine and maybe we can
43:01 - get away with something like this
43:03 - so this narrow thing right here is going
43:06 - to be our building and if i look at it
43:08 - in 3d view
43:10 - i can see that um okay i can see that
43:14 - we do see a balcony here
43:18 - and in 3d view i can see balcony is
43:20 - there that means that elevation 1a is
43:24 - actually our street elevation and
43:26 - elevation two a is going to be our
43:29 - uh
43:30 - garden elevation i don't know backside
43:32 - elevation
43:35 - so i will
43:37 - just extend
43:40 - come on
43:41 - higher it's a little bit laggy but
43:43 - that's fine that's that's not a big deal
43:47 - there we go
43:48 - so elevation
43:50 - 2a is our
43:51 - back elevation so i will actually rename
43:55 - them because i think that's important
43:58 - you can right click on elevation 1a or
44:01 - you can just
44:03 - single click on its name
44:05 - and choose to rename it to
44:11 - street
44:14 - elevation
44:17 - come on elevation
44:19 - and then elevation 2a is going to be
44:23 - back
44:26 - elevation
44:29 - there we go that's it
44:31 - so we have that done
44:33 - and now
44:34 - back to
44:35 - [Music]
44:38 - back to what we we had before
44:41 - uh we we need to specify
44:44 - our
44:45 - uh levels right
44:47 - in in the elevations actually now uh
44:50 - let's let's create a section or rather
44:53 - two sections first and then we will
44:55 - do the levels so
44:57 - back to level one
44:59 - here we do have two elevations already
45:02 - prepared now let's create two sections
45:04 - so section markup or rather section is
45:07 - generated through the view tab as well
45:10 - it's under section here
45:13 - if i click on it
45:16 - it basically just asks me to give it uh
45:18 - a line right draw a line uh through
45:22 - which we will cut
45:24 - uh so i will draw just draw a line right
45:28 - through the middle of the building like
45:30 - so
45:32 - and can i click on that
45:35 - yes i can okay so right in the middle of
45:38 - that line
45:40 - you can see the zigzag here if i click
45:43 - on it then i can
45:44 - then i'm able to
45:46 - kind of drag away
45:50 - that section line away from the building
45:52 - i don't want it to be present
45:55 - inside of the building because i'm going
45:57 - to be designing uh like walls in it and
46:00 - i don't want the section line to get in
46:02 - the way
46:04 - okay so that's our section it kind of
46:06 - works in the similar way as our
46:08 - elevations you have you know how wide it
46:10 - is
46:11 - and also how deep it is right
46:15 - so here i'll just specify the depth like
46:17 - so
46:19 - yeah i think that's that's good so
46:21 - that's our section a a
46:23 - right and i can
46:24 - i can rename it and so on we will do
46:27 - that i think a little bit later
46:30 - uh i'll just call it section one for now
46:32 - i'll keep it as section one if we take a
46:35 - look at it it's nothing too fancy
46:38 - you know
46:39 - it's just a bunch of a bunch of lines
46:41 - nothing
46:43 - nothing more
46:45 - nothing fancy at all
46:50 - just move it up
46:52 - here we go perfect
46:55 - okay um so so that is done
46:58 - that's our section one and let's do
47:00 - section two across section
47:03 - so
47:05 - bam bam
47:08 - and
47:10 - i will be repositioning the sections uh
47:13 - later
47:14 - of course
47:16 - uh so that they show more
47:18 - uh and that
47:20 - that i'm not cutting at awkward places
47:24 - but for now just having everything here
47:26 - i think is great
47:28 - so so that you don't forget
47:31 - okay so we have that section two is also
47:34 - generated
47:37 - let me just make it nicer
47:40 - [Music]
47:43 - bam
47:45 - right now it's not it's not gonna look
47:47 - nice but that's fine we will make it
47:51 - look nice layer down the line
47:55 - okay
47:57 - almost there
47:59 - we will be finishing up by creating
48:03 - floor floors
48:04 - so level one
48:06 - is here and as i mentioned before you
48:09 - can add more levels as long as you're in
48:12 - either elevation or a section view
48:14 - so in elevation view i will just go to
48:20 - [Music]
48:23 - wait where is it
48:25 - architecture
48:27 - oh yeah sorry it's under architecture in
48:30 - the architecture tab
48:32 - it's
48:33 - level
48:35 - right so it's not under view tab it's
48:37 - under architecture tab level as a level
48:40 - to the model okay so the way i'm going
48:43 - to work with this is i will be
48:46 - rebuilding
48:47 - right now i've been using the gener
48:49 - generic levels i will just rebuild all
48:52 - of the levels from scratch which is
48:53 - going to be
48:55 - easy uh quite quite fast so level
48:58 - here
48:59 - and i will just say
49:03 - my first level
49:06 - right doesn't it snap oh there we go it
49:09 - does snap so
49:11 - there's like
49:12 - two lines here
49:14 - i need to
49:15 - make sure that i'm snapping to the
49:17 - correct one
49:21 - why are there two lines here let me see
49:24 - three oh okay so the two lines are there
49:27 - because my
49:29 - plate here my ground plate has a
49:31 - thickness
49:33 - of course
49:34 - so that's why
49:36 - in let's say street elevation or that
49:38 - doesn't matter back elevation uh we see
49:41 - these two lines
49:43 - right that that's the thickness of the
49:45 - ground
49:47 - so i do need the first one the top one
49:51 - to work as my ground floor
49:54 - level
49:56 - from here
49:57 - to here
49:59 - it says level three but that's that's
50:01 - that's fine that's fine uh level three
50:03 - is okay
50:04 - i'll hit escape
50:06 - and we will be renaming them either way
50:09 - that's level three
50:10 - then
50:11 - i will choose to rather than drawing
50:13 - i'll choose to use the pick lines tool
50:17 - because i have a grid line here
50:19 - a picc lines tool
50:23 - and i will say
50:26 - offset
50:28 - you know by how much will we offset from
50:31 - here so i'm picking i'm going to be
50:33 - picking this level 3
50:36 - line which
50:37 - it doesn't let me
50:39 - pick that well hello
50:42 - let me
50:43 - i saw you ah there we go
50:45 - so
50:46 - we will be offsetting from this line and
50:49 - for some reason
50:54 - oh okay so it doesn't let me pick the
50:57 - the grid line it only lets me pick lines
50:59 - from the mall that's fine that's okay as
51:01 - well
51:02 - um
51:04 - by by specifying the offset i will
51:06 - specify the height of my first floor
51:09 - right
51:10 - so
51:12 - let's go for three meters
51:14 - because i think that's that's just a or
51:17 - maybe the gallery space could be a
51:19 - little bit higher the ceiling height
51:22 - could be higher so let's go for three
51:23 - and a half meters
51:25 - so 3500
51:28 - from here
51:29 - up
51:30 - there we go level four
51:33 - right
51:34 - and then then
51:37 - um
51:38 - all other spaces will be three meters
51:41 - high right so the ceiling height will be
51:43 - three meters so three meters here
51:46 - um
51:48 - three meters here let's
51:50 - see let's see
51:52 - can i fit
51:56 - i'm just thinking if i can fit the the
51:58 - whole building into three floors so
52:01 - first floor is going to be the gallery
52:03 - space which is
52:05 - yeah that's just used up
52:07 - second floor
52:09 - um kitchen
52:11 - living room
52:12 - bathroom
52:16 - third floor
52:19 - bedroom work
52:21 - work room
52:24 - now we we won't be able to to fit
52:27 - kitchen bedroom
52:28 - kitchen living room and bathroom into
52:30 - one floor so just in case i'll add a
52:33 - third floor here or or fourth floor and
52:37 - we'll see how we can kind of
52:39 - work around with it
52:41 - so that's our levels now it's time to
52:44 - make them nice
52:47 - let's escape out a bunch of times from
52:51 - our
52:54 - tool
52:55 - and then let's just
52:58 - make them nice in this in in this
53:00 - particular view
53:01 - so here i'll just make sure that
53:04 - they're shown on both sides
53:08 - even though we don't need it actually we
53:10 - don't need it sorry sorry don't don't do
53:12 - that don't do that
53:15 - so let's untick
53:17 - the right hand side and just keep it at
53:19 - the
53:20 - left hand side
53:22 - and then here i'm just going to rename
53:24 - them so i'll select level 3 and call it
53:30 - hello level three
53:37 - why do you not
53:40 - yeah there we go or okay let's do it
53:42 - this way
53:44 - here where it says level three i'll just
53:46 - click on the name of it and i'll just
53:48 - call it
53:49 - round floor
53:53 - would you like to rename corresponding
53:55 - level and views yes
53:58 - becomes ground floor
54:00 - level four
54:03 - is going to be
54:04 - first floor
54:11 - yes
54:12 - level five is going to be ah
54:17 - accidentally
54:19 - double clicked on it
54:21 - level five is going to be
54:23 - second floor
54:28 - don't show me this message again there
54:30 - we go
54:31 - level six
54:35 - third
54:38 - four
54:43 - and then we have level seven wait
54:46 - am i making a skyscraper
54:48 - let's see
54:51 - uh so that's first or ground floor first
54:54 - floor second floor
54:56 - third floor
55:00 - oh yeah and then it would be fourth
55:02 - floor but i can just say yeah
55:04 - let's keep it consistent so fourth
55:07 - floor
55:11 - okay
55:11 - so that's done
55:13 - uh let me
55:15 - now delete level one and the site
55:19 - um
55:21 - floor plans because we don't need them
55:23 - anymore
55:25 - level one deleted site deleted there we
55:27 - go
55:28 - now we're good to go
55:30 - so that's our ground floor
55:32 - looks like that we'll need to kind of
55:36 - make it nice again but that's fine then
55:38 - we have our second floor third floor
55:40 - fourth floor fifth floor uh our first
55:42 - floor
55:43 - actually the
55:45 - the way it's arranged here sucks so i'll
55:48 - just say
55:50 - zero
55:51 - dash ground floor
55:57 - 3500 dash
56:00 - first floor
56:03 - i hope you you understand what i'm what
56:05 - i'm doing
56:06 - here 6500 dash
56:09 - this is in millimeters how high
56:13 - each floor is
56:15 - then we have
56:17 - 9500
56:19 - dash
56:20 - third floor
56:22 - and we have
56:24 - uh
56:26 - 12500
56:28 - dash
56:30 - or floor
56:32 - yes to have all of them kind of stacked
56:34 - up nicely because it goes along the
56:36 - alphabetical order
56:39 - all right
56:41 - almost there
56:43 - not almost there we're done with the
56:45 - the floor plans let's see uh with adding
56:49 - the floor plans so now i'll make
56:50 - everything tidy again by just uh putting
56:54 - down the tick marks where
56:56 - uh where they need to be and
56:59 - cutting open the sections so that they
57:02 - are not in the way
57:05 - uh while i'm doing that
57:07 - questions that you will have are
57:10 - well usually questions that students
57:11 - have
57:12 - can you just use the wall of this
57:15 - building
57:16 - of the surrounding building
57:18 - rather than build your own wall here
57:21 - because it becomes a double wall
57:24 - the answer to that is no you can't you
57:27 - need to build your own wall
57:30 - um then another question would be
57:37 - wait
57:38 - yeah can you change the style of the
57:41 - grid axes and the
57:44 - elevation markups and the section
57:46 - markups and whatnot
57:47 - uh my answer to that is
57:50 - yes you can as long as you download the
57:55 - as you as long as you download them
57:58 - i did the styles i mean
58:00 - and honestly
58:02 - it's too much of a hassle to find a nice
58:05 - one and download it and get it get it
58:08 - going so instead
58:10 - my suggestion would be to
58:13 - just stick stick to these ones
58:17 - uh and if you want to make it nicer
58:20 - then when you plot it out
58:22 - when you plot this this out as a pdf
58:27 - uh change it in photoshop
58:30 - straight up i mean it's gonna take you
58:32 - what 15 minutes to
58:35 - to change all of the drawings
58:38 - section markups and all
58:39 - maybe 20 uh to change the section
58:42 - markups and all of the plans uh where is
58:44 - the tick mark there we go um
58:47 - but it's it's you will have full control
58:50 - over the style of it
58:52 - um yeah yeah that that's that's about it
58:56 - so it created a bunch of ceiling plants
58:58 - as well uh every time when you create a
59:00 - floor uh it will create a ceiling plan
59:03 - as well we don't care about the ceiling
59:05 - plans again and just to
59:07 - be sure that you're not going into the
59:10 - ceiling plans
59:12 - delete them
59:16 - because i i get so many questions about
59:19 - the ceiling plants and
59:21 - not not the ceiling plants but something
59:22 - is not working and then we take a look
59:25 - and
59:26 - students are drawing in
59:28 - in the ceiling plant trying to draw
59:29 - walls in the ceiling plant never works
59:31 - out
59:32 - okay back to here ground floor
59:36 - bam we have our walls
59:38 - um and here you can see that our walls
59:42 - are being constrained not to ground
59:45 - floor but rather to level one so
59:48 - let me
59:50 - let me explain this a little bit more i
59:52 - think i need to explain this a little
59:54 - bit more every
59:56 - geometry
59:57 - in rhino almost every geometry in rhino
60:00 - this is not rhino this is revit
60:02 - goddammit every geometry in revit can be
60:06 - and usually is
60:09 - attached or constrained to some other
60:13 - geometry or a thing an object
60:16 - which makes revit quite parametric in
60:19 - that sense if something changes other
60:21 - things will follow along which is nice
60:23 - but also it adds much more settings for
60:26 - you to kind of remember and know about
60:30 - one of those settings is
60:32 - base constraint
60:34 - so if i select this floor
60:36 - this is not a floor this is a wall if i
60:39 - select this wall right
60:42 - here
60:44 - in the ground floor plan
60:46 - and i choose uh i i take a look at its
60:48 - properties i can see that it's a basic
60:50 - wall it's a generic wall nothing fancy
60:52 - there
60:53 - it does have a base constraint
60:56 - right and it's constrained to level one
60:59 - that's because we drew it in level one
61:02 - even though level one doesn't exist here
61:03 - anymore
61:05 - it's still constrained to it so that
61:06 - doesn't make any sense
61:08 - right so we need to either redraw it in
61:11 - ground floor so that
61:12 - the bottom of the wall all always will
61:16 - follow
61:17 - the ground floor
61:18 - the height of the ground floor
61:20 - or
61:22 - we can just change change it here base
61:24 - constraint
61:25 - move that out
61:27 - find uh ground floor there we go
61:31 - same thing for all other ones if you
61:33 - hold down the control key you can select
61:35 - many walls at once
61:38 - and you can constrain all of them to
61:40 - ground floor so now
61:42 - if ground floor moves the walls will
61:44 - follow along
61:46 - then
61:47 - let me actually have all of them
61:49 - selected
61:51 - then you have
61:52 - a base offset this is basically how high
61:57 - does the
61:59 - do these walls are these walls offset
62:02 - from the ground floor plane
62:05 - right so right now it's zero meaning
62:07 - that they are right on
62:09 - the ground floor
62:11 - and then you have
62:13 - if it's 250 they'll kind of be floating
62:16 - 25 centimeters above the ground floor
62:21 - then you have top constraint which is
62:23 - unconnected
62:25 - sure
62:27 - and you have unconnected height so this
62:29 - is basically
62:31 - it's always going to have the same
62:33 - height of 8 meters and it's just going
62:36 - to be floating
62:37 - in space if you mess around with the
62:39 - height of the ground floor right
62:42 - if you want it to kind of snap
62:44 - to
62:47 - let's say
62:48 - first floor
62:50 - right up to
62:52 - top constraint up to level 3500 first
62:55 - floor
62:57 - then unconnected height becomes locked
63:00 - right
63:00 - and what that means is if i
63:04 - drag this out
63:08 - it's smaller
63:11 - like that
63:15 - right um
63:17 - and if i go to
63:19 - back elevation let's say
63:22 - so
63:22 - by the way you can have two views here
63:26 - you do something like this right
63:30 - so that's my 3d view of
63:32 - with those walls and that's my back view
63:36 - right
63:37 - so now i can say
63:40 - first floor elevation this guy right
63:42 - here instead of 3500
63:45 - i can say
63:47 - 4000
63:49 - [Music]
63:50 - right and see how this moved up let me
63:53 - do that again from 4000 i will switch
63:56 - this to 1500
64:00 - very very small first floor but all of
64:03 - the walls they follow along this is
64:05 - super this is very very useful let's
64:08 - come back to 3500
64:11 - okay so that's great
64:12 - um
64:15 - and let me close 3d view
64:18 - that's great let's jump back to our
64:21 - ground floor plan
64:23 - and continue
64:24 - continue working on this
64:28 - so by now
64:31 - you already have
64:33 - like um
64:35 - the the perimeter for the first
64:38 - floor
64:39 - or the ground floor now let's do the
64:42 - perimeter for the first floor
64:44 - right here
64:46 - right
64:47 - so here
64:49 - i want the
64:52 - why doesn't it show
64:55 - just a second
65:08 - [Music]
65:13 - okay for now we will not be
65:17 - doing that
65:18 - you will see something like this
65:20 - which is okay i will show you
65:24 - how to mess around with the view
65:27 - later
65:28 - later in the tutorials but for now you
65:31 - don't really see in the first floor you
65:33 - don't see the walls which are in the
65:36 - ground floor that's fine because we have
65:38 - these grid axes here and they are here
65:40 - for a reason right
65:42 - so
65:45 - with these grid axes here
65:47 - i will probably specify
65:51 - i i will just draw another perimeter for
65:54 - me to work with so i will create a wall
65:59 - and here is going to be a generic wall
66:02 - it's going to start from the first floor
66:06 - perfect
66:07 - um
66:09 - it's going to be
66:10 - actually not unconnected so i can either
66:14 - specify it here or here doesn't matter
66:16 - so it's not going to be unconnected it's
66:18 - going to be connected to the second
66:20 - floor since i'm drawing it in the first
66:22 - floor right
66:24 - the second floor
66:26 - um and it's going to be
66:30 - finished face exterior that's fine
66:36 - yeah nothing else needs to be changed
66:38 - and then i'll just draw it here and this
66:41 - one i will draw
66:43 - full perimeter
66:45 - um
66:46 - [Music]
66:48 - oh that's not the full perimeter that's
66:50 - too much of a
66:52 - period
66:55 - okay let me try it again wall
66:58 - yes to the second floor that's perfect
67:01 - uh we draw it from here
67:05 - to here
67:06 - just make sure that you snap to the
67:08 - correct
67:10 - um
67:12 - that you snap to the correct points
67:17 - there we go
67:18 - bam
67:19 - that's it hit escape a bunch of times
67:22 - let's take a look at it in 3d view
67:26 - boom how it looks like in
67:29 - [Music]
67:33 - in 3d view
67:34 - right
67:35 - so i have a little bit of a
67:39 - of a nook here
67:40 - or for people to catch a catch a break
67:44 - during a
67:46 - gallery opening or something like that
67:48 - also
67:49 - it's nice it's always nice to have
67:51 - something inside
67:53 - when it's raining
67:55 - so that when you get a tumble for your
67:57 - keys and so on you don't need to
68:00 - stand in the rain
68:03 - okay
68:04 - so we have that done
68:07 - actually maybe i want this to be
68:11 - yeah let's do one thing so now i'm
68:13 - designing i know sorry
68:16 - bear with me i will create a grid line
68:22 - an additional grid line so i'll select
68:25 - i'll choose that i'm going to pick lines
68:28 - and my offset is going to be 1500 again
68:32 - and i'll just offset from grid line a
68:36 - a new grid line which is grid line d
68:39 - and then in the first floor
68:42 - no first floor is fine
68:45 - first layer is fine in the ground floor
68:48 - i will actually take this wall
68:51 - and i'll move it
68:55 - i don't know if i can yes i can there we
68:57 - go i'll just move it
69:01 - to
69:02 - grid line d
69:06 - perfect
69:08 - okay
69:09 - so the reason why i did that is
69:13 - now i have a possibility
69:16 - to do a balcony here
69:19 - right or for my second floor which is
69:22 - great
69:23 - that's exactly what i want
69:26 - okay
69:28 - let's jump back to okay so ground floor
69:30 - is fine right now i'm just blocking out
69:32 - the basic
69:34 - volumes right
69:37 - as as i'm
69:38 - as i'm moving forward with this
69:42 - so that's ground floor
69:46 - first floor is here
69:49 - second floor
69:52 - for the second floor
69:56 - so that's a balcony
70:02 - do we do one more balcony here
70:05 - do we make it smaller and smaller
70:09 - that's the question
70:13 - let's do it simple okay so here i'll
70:15 - just create a wall uh that's gonna be
70:18 - yeah locked to the third floor
70:21 - and i'm just going to say from here to
70:23 - here
70:25 - nothing fancy from here to here to here
70:27 - to here
70:29 - here something like that
70:31 - that's good i won't even show you that
70:33 - third floor
70:35 - and third floor i'm thinking of
70:39 - creating one more grid line
70:43 - and doing an offset of
70:45 - two meters
70:49 - uh yeah picking the line doing an offset
70:52 - of two meters inwards
70:54 - so that it kind of lines from grid line
70:56 - a to grid line e
70:58 - here
70:59 - and the reason why i do two meters is
71:02 - how did i know that it's two meters
71:05 - for alignment is
71:07 - first of all
71:08 - it's it's always done in increments of
71:10 - 50 centimeters right these kind of
71:14 - building offsets and so on usually
71:16 - around 50 centimeters and here it's mere
71:19 - uh one meter 500 so i just assume that
71:22 - it's going to be one more step so that
71:24 - that becomes two meters um oops
71:28 - don't need that grid line
71:31 - okay
71:32 - so
71:33 - here
71:36 - i'm thinking of having it
71:40 - okay so we're drawing a wall but it's
71:42 - going to be a super small one
71:46 - like that
71:50 - okay let's take a look at it in 3d oh
71:53 - and uh sorry i need to make sure that
71:55 - it's
71:56 - up to level four okay great so it is
71:59 - locked to level four now
72:01 - um so this is how it looks
72:04 - the the block out how the blockout looks
72:07 - like
72:11 - that's not good
72:18 - that's a pretty ugly
72:25 - yeah i hate that
72:34 - 1400 no sorry uh 1440
72:40 - centimeters okay so
72:43 - what if we do straight up
72:45 - 10 meters
72:50 - it's probably not going to be enough huh
72:53 - all right that's actually
72:56 - yeah but then you put on a roof and so
72:58 - on so it becomes
73:00 - shitty again
73:02 - we will need to kind of take a closer
73:05 - look at that and see if if it
73:08 - if it looks bad with the roof on but for
73:11 - now this is how this is how it looks
73:14 - that's our block out okay
73:16 - let's uh create some floor slabs right
73:20 - because right now if i take a look at a
73:22 - section of it
73:25 - um and let's just shade it real fast
73:29 - shade that section dash or save the
73:31 - project
73:33 - um
73:34 - you don't really see
73:36 - any any floor slabs that's because we of
73:39 - course you don't see any floor slabs
73:40 - that's because we haven't created any
73:43 - the
73:44 - so let's create some floor slabs
73:46 - i'll show you how to
73:48 - so i'll come back to ground floor
73:50 - and
73:52 - usually you don't really need to create
73:53 - a floor slab from the for the ground
73:55 - floor for a proposal level uh project
73:58 - because it's already on the ground but
74:01 - uh whatever let's go to architecture tab
74:05 - and let's choose
74:07 - floor
74:08 - here
74:09 - floor
74:11 - and it's going to ask us to
74:15 - basically what kind of floor do we want
74:17 - so 1500 is a little bit thin
74:21 - um
74:22 - i'm thinking more
74:24 - about
74:27 - well
74:29 - let's let's see this is only three
74:32 - meters well yeah around three meters
74:38 - actually the thousand five hundred is
74:40 - not that thin that's fine
74:42 - let's use that
74:44 - and here i can either draw
74:47 - a boundary line
74:49 - or i can pick walls right so i can just
74:52 - click
74:53 - click
74:54 - click click that's easy right just
74:56 - picking walls
74:58 - uh or i can pick lines as well you know
75:02 - as long as you create a perimeter it's
75:05 - going to make a floor slab inside of
75:07 - that perimeter
75:09 - this tool does that
75:11 - it's really
75:15 - really simple
75:16 - how it works
75:19 - so yeah
75:20 - let me just hit
75:22 - finish editing mode
75:25 - that's it that's our
75:27 - floor slab right there
75:30 - um right
75:32 - same thing for first floor
75:34 - actually let's take a look at this
75:36 - section
75:37 - so the floor slab goes down
75:41 - into the ground
75:43 - which is fine
75:46 - there are going to be
75:49 - things that we will need to
75:51 - kind of investigate with with the other
75:55 - uh with
75:57 - the the first floor
75:59 - also why are you you need to be here and
76:03 - you need to be gone there we go
76:06 - so let's do first floor because it's
76:08 - going to be a little bit more tricky due
76:10 - to the balcony and the cantilever here
76:14 - first floor
76:16 - there we go a floor
76:18 - slab
76:20 - and here we have
76:24 - a balcony right remember that we
76:28 - hope you do
76:29 - we have a balcony here
76:33 - and we have a cantilever here so let's
76:37 - see how we can do this
76:42 - i will just pick lines for now and i'll
76:46 - just say this this this
76:49 - and this
76:51 - these four lines here
76:54 - except lines cannot intersect each other
76:58 - um
77:00 - continue okay so it doesn't let me uh
77:04 - intersect the lines that's fine i can
77:06 - just draw the lines myself
77:09 - that's okay let me cancel quit uh are
77:11 - you sure you want to discard four yes uh
77:14 - so i will just do it again
77:17 - this time i'll choose floor and instead
77:19 - of picking lines i will just draw my own
77:23 - line
77:24 - um
77:27 - like that
77:28 - that
77:30 - like that easy right so i'm just using
77:33 - the line tool
77:34 - once i'm done i hit the accept button
77:37 - here
77:39 - uh would you like walls to go up to this
77:41 - floor's level to attach to its bottom
77:44 - would you like
77:47 - ah would you like walls that go up to
77:49 - this floor's level
77:51 - you attach to its bottom
77:56 - attach i don't know
77:59 - okay so we have our floor slab here
78:03 - um this is sketchy let's look at it in
78:06 - this section
78:11 - actually looks good
78:14 - okay
78:16 - looks looks not not that bad looks fine
78:20 - uh this one though
78:23 - this
78:24 - should extend to the outside
78:27 - of well
78:29 - not really it shouldn't it shouldn't
78:31 - extend to the outside of the wall but
78:35 - oh me i know i know i know i know how
78:38 - we're going to deal with this so
78:41 - let me explain
78:43 - this wall and this wall
78:47 - and this floor make a very awkward
78:49 - connection here what we want is we want
78:51 - this wall to go into the ground as if it
78:55 - was a foundation block and we could do
78:58 - foundation blocks i know but
79:01 - i'm lazy so i'll just extend these walls
79:04 - so let's go to ground floor
79:06 - and select these floors
79:09 - and where it says
79:12 - um
79:13 - base offset
79:14 - i'll say minus 500 millimeters hit apply
79:20 - go to section one
79:23 - and now they offset
79:25 - downwards by minus 500 millimeters so we
79:29 - have foundation blocks kinda
79:31 - good enough
79:32 - for this kind of
79:34 - project
79:35 - um
79:36 - one two
79:38 - three three more
79:40 - or rather two more floor slabs and the
79:42 - roof but i will make a flat roof so it's
79:44 - i'm just going to use a floor slab to to
79:47 - make a flat roof
79:49 - um
79:50 - or should i make a angled roof
79:55 - i'll do both i'll show you how to make
79:57 - an angled roof and then i will make a
79:59 - flat roof afterwards so
80:03 - second floor
80:05 - there we go
80:06 - let's do floor
80:10 - and here
80:11 - it's going to be very straightforward
80:13 - it's just going to be picking walls
80:17 - because there's no cantilevers there's
80:19 - no balcony so i'm just picking floors uh
80:21 - picking walls
80:23 - attached
80:24 - um
80:26 - highlighted walls are attached
80:29 - to but miss the highlighted targets
80:32 - [Music]
80:36 - yeah sure okay
80:38 - let's see sometimes it gives you errors
80:41 - but i think we are
80:44 - ah
80:47 - that's why
80:48 - so we don't want to attach huh
80:52 - let's let's investigate investigation
80:54 - time
80:55 - so the reason why this happened
81:03 - so that's fine
81:05 - that's okay
81:06 - but this is not
81:08 - uh the reason why this happened is that
81:11 - these walls
81:13 - the bottom ones i think or maybe the top
81:16 - ones now the bottom ones the bottom
81:18 - walls
81:20 - had to move down
81:22 - since we said to attach they moved down
81:26 - to
81:26 - let the floor slab in but the problem is
81:31 - that
81:32 - the floor slab
81:33 - only reaches the inside of the walls not
81:37 - the outside so
81:39 - honestly i'm going to fix it by
81:44 - detaching here
81:46 - let me ctrl z
81:50 - delete
81:51 - let me do it again
81:53 - actually i could have just left it as it
81:55 - is but
81:56 - i want to show you
81:58 - um how to do it so floor
82:02 - this time i'm going to yeah sure i'll
82:05 - i'll pick walls again
82:08 - intercept
82:09 - but here i'll say don't attach
82:11 - right
82:12 - and now
82:13 - technically yeah now it's fine and in
82:16 - this section it also looks fine
82:19 - good we fixed it
82:22 - now this is going to be a little bit
82:24 - more tricky
82:28 - but we'll make it we'll make it
82:30 - believe i believe so third floor
82:34 - the floor slap is going to go up until
82:36 - here up until grid line a
82:39 - while the walls end here so we get
82:42 - one more balcony
82:45 - and also here we get a balcony
82:47 - or do we wait
82:49 - i don't remember yeah so we got two
82:52 - balconies here
82:54 - we get a lot of balconies we need to
82:57 - take a look at that later on um
83:00 - so in third floor i'm going to
83:04 - create a floor
83:07 - which is going to
83:10 - [Music]
83:16 - which is going to go
83:20 - between grid line a
83:23 - and grid line c
83:25 - with this one right here okay
83:27 - so let me just draw it uh
83:30 - it's it's just going to be faster to
83:32 - just draw
83:33 - draw it like that
83:35 - there we go
83:37 - except
83:38 - this time we attach i believe
83:43 - yep
83:44 - um let's take a look at it in the
83:47 - section
83:49 - yeah that's
83:51 - good enough i think
83:54 - yeah okay
83:55 - so that that that that looks good
84:00 - so we have our
84:03 - our volume here
84:06 - um can i
84:09 - and this is our volume with the shadows
84:14 - not much to so you can turn on the
84:17 - shadows by
84:19 - clicking on the shadow icon of course
84:22 - i wonder how do you
84:24 - how do you change this yeah send
84:26 - settings there we go send settings
84:28 - um
84:31 - top
84:32 - left
84:33 - now
84:34 - sign settings
84:37 - up left
84:38 - and there we go
84:43 - not much is going on but you know kind
84:45 - of helps you understand
84:49 - the volume a little bit better maybe
84:51 - maybe i don't know
84:53 - okay
84:54 - so we have that
84:57 - let us
85:00 - continue
85:01 - um so there are two more things that i'm
85:03 - gonna do and then we will finish up this
85:05 - portion of the tutorial
85:07 - um tutorial number one
85:09 - so
85:10 - i am going to show you how to make a
85:13 - roof
85:15 - so making a roof is going to be
85:18 - quite fun let's let's jump to
85:23 - let's jump to the third floor
85:28 - no the fourth floor that's our where our
85:31 - roof is going to be
85:33 - and
85:34 - i just need to know so our
85:37 - walls go between e and b
85:41 - and they reach here so it's it's between
85:43 - e
85:45 - and it's
85:46 - between b so here we have our floors
85:49 - by the way
85:50 - if you are tired of kind of playing
85:53 - detective and not seeing it you can go
85:56 - to
85:57 - view range here
86:01 - view range
86:04 - and choosing that the
86:07 - view depth how deep do you see
86:10 - uh goes a little bit
86:13 - a little bit deeper so let's say
86:18 - unlimited sure unlimited view depth hit
86:22 - apply
86:26 - hit okay
86:27 - and now you will see the
86:30 - the floors
86:33 - all of the floors below below fourth
86:36 - floor so now you see the the walls here
86:38 - um
86:39 - and we will
86:41 - add a roof so this is going to be an
86:44 - angled roof
86:46 - click
86:47 - there we go and it's basically uh it's
86:50 - the same way as drawing a floor slab
86:52 - right you just choose um
86:55 - [Music]
86:56 - for instance the walls click click click
86:59 - click like that
87:01 - and here you can choose
87:05 - not
87:09 - there we go so here you can choose what
87:12 - kind of
87:17 - sorry
87:21 - um
87:24 - having having a stroke i think
87:27 - here you can choose what kind of angle
87:29 - the roof will will have so now i'm just
87:32 - kind of clicking on all the walls and
87:35 - hitting accept and this is the roof and
87:38 - if we take a look at it in 3d
87:42 - uh it's the ugliest roof
87:44 - that you could that you could find
87:47 - let me just try to snap it there we go
87:51 - that's done um let's take a look at it
87:55 - there it is
87:57 - so there's a lot of problems with it
87:59 - right
88:01 - the main one
88:02 - being that it's
88:07 - there there's this kind of
88:09 - very weird gap where the the walls end
88:12 - and the roof begins that makes
88:14 - absolutely no sense whatsoever
88:17 - right so so that's that's bad
88:19 - of course
88:20 - um
88:21 - and other things are
88:24 - what if you don't want
88:26 - all all of these slopes to be like that
88:29 - right what what if you want
88:31 - um
88:32 - a roof like this right
88:36 - uh can can you control it of course you
88:38 - can right so i'm going to do it again
88:41 - but this time i'm going to show you how
88:43 - do you fill
88:47 - how do you not make this this ugly gap
88:49 - here right so i'll delete the roof and
88:52 - i'll
88:53 - create a new one
88:59 - roof there we go roof
89:01 - and i'll just
89:02 - choose
89:03 - by the way you need you can choose what
89:06 - kind of a
89:07 - roof you want is it concrete is it uh
89:10 - generic i'll just see generic doesn't
89:12 - matter
89:13 - um
89:14 - and here instead of choosing the walls i
89:17 - will choose
89:18 - to just draw a line i i that's what i
89:20 - prefer to do
89:22 - that
89:23 - that
89:26 - that
89:31 - come on
89:36 - and that's why we save by the way
89:41 - there we go
89:46 - such a mess
89:51 - that
89:52 - oops slightly messed it up but that's
89:54 - fine we will fix it and
89:57 - i mean that point
89:59 - there we go
90:01 - oh my god
90:04 - when you zoom in okay so while this is
90:07 - like when you zoom in
90:09 - too much it's going to redraw the whole
90:12 - model
90:13 - at a higher detail and that's why it
90:14 - lags um i absolutely hate that thing
90:18 - about
90:19 - revit but
90:21 - they insist on doing it so yeah
90:24 - whatever
90:25 - okay so
90:27 - here i just need to
90:29 - move
90:31 - those
90:32 - i'll just need to move that point
90:35 - but that's fine
90:36 - uh for now let's just
90:40 - accept it and this is how the the roof
90:42 - looks like now
90:45 - a little bit better why is it sticking
90:47 - out here
90:51 - why is it
90:52 - is it sticking out it is sticking out
90:55 - did i mess up i think i messed up
90:59 - i think i
91:01 - anchored it to the wrong no i didn't
91:06 - wait
91:10 - so it's not sticking out here what about
91:12 - section two
91:15 - and it is indeed sticking out here but
91:17 - it's sticking out here because i messed
91:19 - up the other side oh yeah that's
91:22 - of course that that's why uh that's
91:25 - because i i misclicked on the other side
91:27 - while i was
91:29 - right here so this is the part that's
91:31 - sticking out
91:33 - so let's fix it you can double click on
91:35 - the roof and then you can
91:38 - change the
91:43 - change the points where where they are
91:48 - that
91:49 - uh
91:50 - [Music]
91:52 - cancel
91:54 - how are you even joined don't don't lie
91:57 - to me
92:01 - okay or
92:02 - or you can just draw it again because
92:06 - it's
92:07 - faster
92:08 - oh my god to do it that
92:10 - way okay so let's draw it again
92:14 - click
92:16 - click
92:18 - this time don't mess up
92:20 - click
92:22 - click
92:25 - click there we go
92:27 - okay
92:28 - we have our clean room roof right
92:31 - uh now i'm going to click on this modify
92:34 - icon here so that i can select my
92:38 - um um
92:40 - [Music]
92:41 - lines
92:43 - and notice how here we have the angles
92:47 - so i can define um
92:50 - the angles of all of the slopes
92:53 - of each individual slope of the roof so
92:57 - here by default it's set to 30 but what
92:59 - if we do 75
93:01 - for this side
93:03 - 75 for this side
93:06 - and then these are going to be
93:09 - dasher let's let's do 75 here as well
93:11 - why not why not
93:15 - this is gonna be fun okay so we hit uh
93:18 - finish
93:21 - we take a look at it and that's our new
93:23 - roof
93:24 - great
93:27 - [Music]
93:28 - so that's with 75
93:31 - degree angle again uh not the roof that
93:35 - we want
93:36 - so let's double click on it again
93:40 - or not
93:42 - let's double click on it again there we
93:43 - go and let's mess around with it even
93:46 - further so
93:49 - these icons right here specify which
93:52 - lines define slope right and if i select
93:56 - one of these lines let's see this one
93:59 - it will have a tick mark here that says
94:01 - define slope so for instance if i were
94:05 - to
94:06 - choose this line and say that it doesn't
94:08 - define slope
94:11 - and choose this line and also say and
94:13 - tick the part that says define slope
94:16 - so that it doesn't define slope here as
94:18 - well and change this to something more
94:20 - reasonable let's say 45 degrees
94:24 - and this one change this to 45 degrees
94:27 - as well
94:28 - hit accept
94:31 - now we have a proper
94:33 - you know a proper roof just like this
94:35 - one right
94:37 - well the the walls are disconnected from
94:40 - it but other than that i think it's fine
94:43 - so actually that's that's important how
94:46 - do we connect the walls
94:49 - to the roof
94:51 - so what we can do is we can go to the
94:54 - third floor
94:55 - and we can choose the walls that we want
94:57 - to connect
95:00 - like that we choose these walls right
95:03 - and we want to say yo
95:05 - extend these walls
95:07 - until they attach
95:09 - to the roof so attach
95:11 - so i'll go to
95:13 - when i have this wall selected i'll
95:15 - choose
95:16 - this tool attach top base
95:20 - like that
95:21 - and then i'll just simply click on the
95:24 - roof
95:25 - so you might need to change your view or
95:28 - something like that or
95:30 - just have two views opened and click on
95:32 - the roof
95:36 - and click on the roof
95:37 - there we go
95:39 - so then it attaches
95:41 - and then you
95:43 - yeah you hit escape a bunch of times and
95:45 - take a look at it and uh
95:48 - yeah that's good that's that that's good
95:50 - that's uh that's a wall that's attached
95:52 - to the roof
95:54 - right
95:57 - so that's uh
95:59 - that's how you work with a sloped roof
96:02 - nothing too fancy right
96:07 - another thing is how do you work with a
96:12 - flat roof
96:13 - and this one i i prefer um
96:17 - i just i don't know i i prefer flat
96:20 - roofs so i'll delete this
96:23 - right so immediately the walls come back
96:26 - to being normal because they don't have
96:28 - anything to to attach to
96:30 - and instead in the
96:32 - fourth floor i'll just create a floor
96:36 - right
96:36 - i'll just create a floor i will just
96:39 - choose
96:40 - um
96:43 - i'll just pick walls i think yeah let's
96:46 - just do it super simple pick walls
96:49 - intercept
96:50 - uh would you like two walls to go up to
96:52 - this floor no no we don't we want to
96:55 - keep it as it is so don't attach
96:59 - uh would you like to join geometry cut
97:01 - the overlapping volume out of the walls
97:03 - up
97:04 - yeah sure
97:06 - whatever
97:08 - okay
97:09 - and we're gucci
97:10 - so
97:12 - ah battery no
97:15 - no battery come back
97:20 - i wonder
97:21 - it's going to be alive now
97:25 - right there we go
97:28 - hey
97:30 - okay good
97:31 - um
97:34 - where was i
97:35 - oh yeah
97:37 - one last thing is
97:39 - i am going to be doing concrete railings
97:43 - um so i'm going to be showing that how
97:46 - to do you know for these balconies of
97:47 - course they need railings uh so i'm
97:49 - going to be doing concrete railings uh
97:52 - you might want to do you know
97:54 - regular railings that's that's fine as
97:56 - well it's just remember that by default
98:00 - revit has really really ugly
98:03 - rails
98:04 - so
98:06 - you know
98:08 - take it with caution right
98:10 - use that tool with caution i will show
98:11 - that in in the next tutorial but for now
98:14 - concrete railings those are basically
98:16 - walls right nothing nothing fancy so
98:19 - let's take a look uh i will need a a
98:22 - railing on the
98:24 - third floor
98:26 - two railings actually on the third floor
98:30 - there and there
98:32 - and also i'll need a railing on the
98:36 - first floor
98:38 - yes first floor railing in the garden
98:40 - view and a third floor railing okay so
98:43 - let's start with first floor
98:45 - first ah that's a tank twister first
98:48 - floor railing
98:50 - uh right here
98:52 - right
98:53 - and i'll just grab a wall this time i
98:56 - don't need a
98:58 - 30 centimeter
99:00 - wall
99:01 - um i'll just be using um
99:03 - [Music]
99:06 - block work maybe
99:09 - now let's go for
99:10 - generic uh
99:12 - 140 millimeters
99:14 - yeah that that's fine
99:16 - so basic generic wall 140 mil
99:20 - um finish face exterior height
99:23 - this time it's going to be
99:25 - unconnected and it's going to be the
99:28 - height of the railing so um
99:31 - let's go for
99:33 - a meter
99:35 - a meter is a little bit
99:37 - low for railing but i think that's fine
99:40 - usually it's
99:41 - 1.1 let's go for 1.1 there's no
99:46 - um there are cats there so
99:50 - i don't know why i said that
99:54 - doesn't matter okay so we do have our
99:59 - railing there
100:00 - oh it even has an ugly
100:03 - hatch
100:04 - oh i don't like that hatch
100:09 - i wonder if we can get rid of it
100:14 - hidden line
100:17 - so
100:18 - this happens
100:20 - sometimes uh not sometimes it's usually
100:23 - the case that uh certain types of
100:26 - geometries have certain times of
100:27 - representation you know in certain
100:30 - drawings
100:31 - so this one
100:33 - in particular has
100:35 - this ugly ugly
100:39 - brick work hatch
100:42 - which we can i believe
100:44 - fix
100:46 - okay first of all let me escape
100:49 - no i don't want to make a floor quit i
100:52 - think cannot be under yes
100:55 - okay uh so if i select this is going to
100:59 - be me actually investigating how to get
101:01 - rid of that hatch
101:03 - if i select all of these walls and i add
101:05 - a type
101:10 - so i click on edit type here we have
101:16 - the graphics and maybe here i can choose
101:20 - to not have a hatch
101:23 - yeah no pattern
101:25 - hit ok
101:27 - hit apply
101:34 - yeah that
101:37 - that doesn't care
101:39 - that doesn't care at all
101:41 - uh there's one more thing that i could
101:43 - do at the type
101:46 - basic wall
101:48 - structure added structure
101:51 - concrete messing i believe it's
101:54 - somewhere here
101:57 - so that's
101:58 - thermal and that's concrete masonry so i
102:02 - could change
102:04 - change it here
102:07 - with this block or sorry this this
102:10 - that's cut pattern surface pattern i
102:12 - could change it here but i really
102:14 - don't want to
102:16 - really really don't want to
102:18 - [Music]
102:23 - let's leave it let's leave it as it is
102:25 - for now um yeah let's not mess around
102:28 - with that
102:30 - sorry for that intermission uh hope you
102:33 - didn't get too bored with me
102:36 - um let's add
102:38 - more
102:39 - uh
102:40 - walls here i can't look at it i'm just
102:43 - going to
102:44 - to change it
102:47 - i'm just going to change its
102:51 - type so i'm going to select these walls
102:54 - and
102:54 - just do
103:00 - foundation generic 200 ml i could do 200
103:04 - ml or 135
103:10 - yeah there we go okay so i'm i've just
103:12 - chose a different
103:15 - different type of uh
103:18 - wall
103:19 - for that okay so now let's draw a wall
103:23 - not masonry but rather 135 mil
103:27 - wall
103:28 - from here to
103:31 - oh it goes along the center line no no
103:34 - no no no no no
103:36 - so we will need to switch it
103:39 - push it around
103:44 - yeah yeah save project
103:47 - um
103:49 - so it goes along finish face exterior
103:53 - it goes along
103:55 - it's unconnected it's 1100
103:59 - no
104:00 - yes 1100
104:02 - it's chained
104:04 - has this type
104:06 - perfect
104:08 - that's all we need
104:11 - and then we just draw it
104:13 - straight up
104:14 - bam bam
104:16 - bam
104:17 - enter
104:19 - that's drawn
104:20 - and then we have another
104:23 - we have it
104:24 - in another site notice how i'm not
104:26 - creating any geometry whatsoever
104:30 - in the
104:31 - in the 3d view
104:33 - yeah that's that's how you work with
104:37 - revit
104:38 - so here i'm going to
104:41 - draw up
104:42 - am i in the floor
104:46 - escape out of that sorry about that draw
104:49 - walls
104:50 - from here
104:51 - uh oops that was my bad a long
104:57 - long there we go enter
105:00 - so we have our
105:02 - railing here as well
105:05 - all right i think we are
105:10 - we're fine i think we're good with with
105:14 - the
105:15 - with the geometry so far
105:18 - uh one last thing that i want to show
105:20 - you before we finish up
105:22 - uh for today for this tutorial
105:26 - is
105:29 - as you probably can tell i'm not a big
105:31 - fan of the user interface
105:34 - of
105:35 - revit
105:36 - and the clunkiness
105:38 - of it um
105:40 - so one last thing that i want to show
105:41 - you
105:42 - is called a
105:44 - a section box and
105:47 - for that i need to
105:51 - go to so so if i in 3d view
105:55 - if i actually don't want to see all of
105:57 - this crap
105:59 - right
106:00 - especially here what the hell are you
106:02 - delete
106:03 - there we go
106:05 - if i don't want to see all of this crap
106:07 - i can
106:08 - just create a section just a small
106:11 - section of the
106:14 - building itself right so in 3d so i can
106:18 - do that by going to
106:20 - modify
106:26 - yeah i can go to modify tab i can select
106:29 - all of the objects here
106:32 - all of the objects
106:34 - and i can click on this icon right here
106:37 - which is called selection box
106:41 - bam
106:43 - so it will create this kind of a
106:45 - box for me
106:47 - around my
106:48 - everything that i have selected and i
106:50 - can once i select that box i can click
106:53 - and drag
106:54 - the side sides of it
106:59 - right
107:04 - so that i only
107:07 - i only see
107:09 - my building
107:11 - and also that's that's a good way of how
107:14 - to investigate uh the inside of the
107:16 - building so my box is a little bit
107:20 - you know the angle is not that great so
107:22 - let me just switch it to top view here
107:25 - real fast in 3d by just clicking on the
107:29 - on this icon right here top
107:31 - and i will just rotate
107:35 - what the
107:38 - oh it rotates around that
107:41 - that point why
107:44 - um again we do it again rotate this time
107:48 - i will actually look at
107:51 - the tools here so i'll say
107:54 - center of rotation place
107:56 - i will place the center of rotation here
108:00 - perfect
108:02 - and i will rotate it
108:05 - like so
108:06 - bam
108:08 - that's good enough right
108:10 - um that's it uh then we can go back to
108:13 - our 3d view
108:15 - by just clicking on this you know
108:16 - dragging on on on this box here
108:20 - not box yeah it is a box right on the
108:23 - top right hand side
108:25 - and now i can mess around by just moving
108:28 - in the section box and looking at my
108:32 - at my geometry
108:37 - right
108:38 - and that's my block out for now
108:41 - i will change the angle of the sun
108:48 - [Music]
108:56 - do i even care i don't care
108:59 - so boston sure i'll just change the time
109:03 - lie
109:04 - okay that's
109:05 - 5 p.m
109:06 - that's my bad 12
109:09 - no
109:10 - morning
109:11 - no even more
109:14 - yeah that's night time right
109:16 - uh
109:17 - summer solstice apply
109:21 - 9 a.m
109:22 - good eight that's that's even better
109:25 - okay
109:26 - so now the sun is shining inside of my
109:30 - um inside of my building
109:33 - through this section
109:40 - okay i think that's that's good enough
109:43 - for for
109:44 - for today
109:46 - uh so the task is
109:48 - right now after you've watched tutorial
109:50 - one to make this kind of a block out
109:54 - very basic block out of
109:58 - the volumes that you're going to
110:00 - have
110:01 - in the
110:03 - you know in between squished in between
110:05 - those two buildings
110:06 - that you are going to put function in
110:09 - uh into tomorrow
110:11 - so that's that's the task
110:13 - um for those of you who are not sure how
110:16 - you'll manage to fit in you know the
110:20 - bedroom and and whatnot
110:23 - um i would suggest just taking a piece
110:25 - of paper or
110:27 - autocad or whatever and just drawing out
110:29 - the plan basic basic plans you know with
110:32 - the staircases and whatnot
110:34 - just to know what you
110:36 - what you actually want to do right what
110:38 - you actually want to accomplish
110:40 - here i am not doing that just to save
110:42 - time
110:44 - um
110:44 - so my building is going to be worse uh
110:48 - much much worse than your buildings
110:52 - right
110:53 - so other than that i think we are
110:57 - um
110:58 - we're done here
111:01 - go get to work and i'll see you tomorrow
111:04 - so
111:05 - in part one we have finished doing the
111:07 - block out
111:08 - so this is what i would call uh
111:11 - you know a good enough block out for us
111:13 - to start detailing so we basically have
111:16 - the whole proportion going and
111:19 - everything seems to be in order
111:21 - in this regard so now uh what i want to
111:24 - do is i want to focus on
111:27 - um shall we go for doors and windows
111:30 - perhaps
111:31 - yeah let's go for doors and windows so
111:34 - i'll show you
111:36 - different techniques and different ways
111:38 - on how you can
111:40 - create doors and windows in your revit
111:43 - file so
111:44 - to begin let's add a door let's add an
111:47 - entrance door to our building
111:50 - i'll go to ground floor
111:52 - here and actually
111:54 - at this stage i really
111:56 - like doing like i really like splitting
111:59 - um this view into two so
112:03 - here i have my 3d view
112:07 - and my ground floor view right these two
112:09 - views if you don't see a 3d view just
112:11 - double click here right
112:14 - and it will open up the 3d view for you
112:16 - so we have these two tabs these two
112:18 - views
112:20 - and basically what i want to do is i
112:21 - just want to take this 3d view
112:24 - and drag it
112:26 - away
112:28 - all right like so so now it's like a
112:31 - separate window that is not docked
112:33 - anywhere and then just taking it and
112:36 - dragging it to the side
112:38 - like so
112:41 - will
112:42 - eventually show me this
112:45 - right this blue rectangle once i see
112:48 - this blue rectangle i will release my
112:50 - mouse button and then this 3d view gets
112:54 - docked so now i'm working
112:56 - in two views at the same time or rather
112:59 - i see two views at the same time which
113:02 - is super convenient
113:04 - so
113:06 - let me just
113:08 - cut away that part
113:10 - so that's my box selection tool remember
113:14 - we are using it
113:15 - um
113:17 - and i'm using it to just cut away the
113:19 - bits that i don't need i'll maybe even
113:23 - cut deeper
113:24 - into into these surrounding buildings
113:28 - just so that i only see the
113:31 - my
113:32 - almost only see my building
113:37 - something like that okay so that is no
113:40 - no
113:41 - now that is not obscured
113:44 - okay so this is our entrance area
113:47 - uh which is which relates to this wall
113:50 - right here you can see once i select
113:52 - this wall here it will show up here
113:55 - get highlighted here as well
113:58 - and here i just want to add a door so
114:01 - how do you do that well you select the
114:03 - door tool uh well i zoomed in so now we
114:06 - wait there we go
114:07 - i click on the door tool and here before
114:10 - i start adding it it will ask me for
114:13 - what kind of door do i want
114:14 - so this is a single flush door 2.1
114:17 - meters high 0.9 meters 90 centimeters
114:20 - wide this is like a typical
114:23 - typical door
114:25 - and actually there's not a lot of
114:27 - options here to choose from so i will be
114:30 - choosing the default you know the
114:33 - regular doorway
114:35 - i think that's that's absolutely fine
114:38 - i'll just add it
114:40 - do we center it
114:43 - probably just do it like that
114:46 - bam
114:48 - so i have just added the door and let's
114:50 - say um
114:52 - let's say i want
114:55 - a layer down the line i will want to add
114:58 - a shelf here or i will want to have a
115:00 - possibility to add a shelf here so we
115:02 - know that the shelf width is 60
115:05 - centimeters
115:06 - so the way i do it is
115:08 - i will just
115:11 - let me just see if i can
115:13 - hello
115:15 - i'm i zoomed in too much again just give
115:18 - me a second
115:19 - give not me give right uh rabbit a
115:22 - second
115:23 - two to catch up there we go
115:26 - oh my god
115:29 - it's quite a quite a slow program
115:33 - ain't gonna lie
115:35 - not responding huh
115:37 - well that that calls for a coffee break
115:41 - zoom out there we go
115:47 - and i'll just click on modify
115:50 - here this modify button
115:52 - there we go
115:53 - i will select the door
115:55 - and now i can
115:57 - here this this dimension i can add i can
116:01 - write rather
116:02 - what kind of dimension i want instead of
116:05 - zero instead of the door being flush
116:07 - with this wall i can add 600 millimeters
116:10 - enter
116:11 - that is wrong minus 600
116:15 - that is correct
116:17 - so the correct way as well of course
116:21 - and thus we
116:23 - now have this gap here where we will be
116:25 - able to put a shelf or you know a
116:28 - seating area anything like that usually
116:31 - i i do this for
116:34 - for a rack
116:36 - for clothes rack
116:38 - for the entrance
116:40 - so that's how you add a door that's
116:42 - that's basically it right you you just
116:44 - kind of do it you just add a door
116:47 - um another thing is adding a window so
116:51 - while we're still here in our entrance i
116:54 - i will be adding a window here
116:57 - in this area
116:59 - so
116:59 - it's done in a exactly same way as the
117:02 - door i'll select the window
117:05 - tool
117:06 - and i will choose what kind of window i
117:08 - want i think i'll just go for the
117:11 - default one because these guys have too
117:14 - many subdivisions i don't want that many
117:16 - subdivisions so i'll just use the
117:20 - regular one
117:22 - and
117:24 - i'll choose this the type of it
117:27 - so let's say
117:32 - that's
117:33 - 90 centimeters by 1.8
117:36 - meters i think that's that's gonna be
117:38 - okay
117:40 - or let's do
117:42 - let's do 40 centimeters
117:45 - by 1.8 meters i think that's going to be
117:47 - cooler
117:48 - like that
117:52 - and here i can specify how high the
117:55 - window is going to be
117:57 - right so that's before me clicking on
118:00 - the wall i can specify how high this
118:02 - window can be or i can do that layer
118:05 - layer down the line that's fine as well
118:08 - so let me just
118:10 - put it in
118:11 - [Music]
118:12 - probably
118:14 - maybe closer to the door
118:16 - there we go something like that so i
118:19 - constantly check the dimensions to see
118:21 - if they are correct and 300 ml i think
118:24 - is fine so we end up with having
118:28 - the door and this kind of a
118:30 - narrow window inserted
118:33 - let me click on the modify tool again
118:36 - select the window and see what we can
118:39 - what we can change with it so the first
118:40 - thing is cell height
118:42 - and the second thing is head height
118:44 - right so in terms of cell height i can
118:46 - say well what if it's 500 millimeters
118:50 - hit apply
118:52 - see the window just moves up
118:55 - and then the head height updates as well
118:58 - so now
119:00 - let's say i want the window to be
119:01 - aligned the height
119:03 - the top of the window rather to be
119:05 - aligned with the door
119:07 - the way i do it is i will just select
119:09 - the door and just double check so the
119:11 - head height of the door is 2.134
119:15 - meters
119:16 - so if i select the window and here for
119:19 - the head height i type in two one three
119:21 - four
119:23 - hit apply
119:27 - ah yes of course
119:29 - it gets aligned it does get aligned with
119:31 - the door but i forgot the how is that
119:34 - called the framing the framing of the
119:36 - door and i assume the framing of the
119:38 - door is like um
119:40 - that looks like five or maybe ten
119:42 - centimeters no that's definitely not 10.
119:44 - so that looks like a 5 centimeter
119:46 - framing so i will just add
119:49 - 5 centimeters to this head height
119:52 - which is going to be a total of 2184
119:56 - millimeters
119:58 - and that looks right
120:01 - i think
120:02 - maybe not
120:06 - yeah we're one centimeter
120:09 - away
120:10 - two one
120:13 - nine four
120:15 - i could just yeah probably i should do
120:17 - this i could just kind of select the
120:19 - door right and go to edit type and find
120:23 - the trim
120:24 - extension here
120:26 - so apparently trim width
120:29 - is set to be 76
120:34 - millimeters
120:35 - so i will just change it to
120:38 - 50. apply
120:42 - so now it is indeed 5 centimeters
120:46 - and now if i change this back to 2 1 8 4
120:50 - apply
120:51 - there we go now they are aligned so it's
120:54 - a little bit fiddly uh edit type lets
120:57 - you edit the type of the door itself so
120:59 - you can make adjustments to how the door
121:02 - looks like same thing for the window
121:06 - um right so we have that done now
121:09 - uh nothing too fancy but you know
121:13 - it is
121:14 - it it it is working
121:17 - so that's good
121:18 - um
121:19 - and that's
121:20 - what
121:24 - we will visit that partly ah no never
121:26 - mind that's that's the surrounding
121:28 - building so that's not not an issue
121:30 - um
121:32 - so that's basically how you add doors
121:34 - and windows right nothing too fancy by
121:36 - the way if you want to change
121:38 - the type of a window once you have
121:41 - inserted it you can same thing for the
121:43 - door so you just select the window you
121:45 - go to prop
121:47 - you go to the properties tab and you
121:49 - just choose a different type right
121:51 - bam it changes
121:55 - and now we need to fish out which one
121:57 - yeah it was this one good
122:00 - um so that is that
122:03 - in terms of
122:06 - let me do it again for the
122:09 - for the other side just so that
122:13 - we are on the same page
122:15 - and everyone is following along or
122:17 - rather
122:18 - maybe i want this
122:20 - to be full glass
122:22 - right this whole area perhaps i want it
122:25 - to be full glass
122:27 - i can do that by
122:30 - first carving out
122:33 - a hole in the wall
122:37 - and then adding
122:40 - what's called the curtain curtain
122:42 - curtain wall inside of that opening
122:45 - so to do an opening
122:48 - to create an opening you can either
122:50 - create a vertical or a horizontal
122:52 - opening and the vertical opening is just
122:54 - called a
122:56 - wall opening nothing fancy and
123:01 - the horizontal one or rather maybe i
123:03 - should call this the vertical one so the
123:05 - shaft is a vertical opening while the
123:08 - wall opening is horizontal right
123:12 - so yeah again the the
123:15 - shaft is is
123:17 - [Music]
123:18 - you carve away from what's called
123:23 - floor slabs and
123:25 - ceilings and
123:26 - roofs
123:27 - with wall opening you carve away from
123:29 - the wall
123:30 - so i will just select that tool
123:33 - which will basically ask me to
123:37 - what does it ask me
123:39 - that's a rectangular opening in a
123:41 - straight uh or curved wall so for that i
123:44 - probably need to do it in 3d right or
123:47 - maybe we can do it in 2d let's see
123:52 - click
123:53 - no click yes
123:55 - okay so it's basically two clicks uh let
123:58 - me do that again because this was a a
124:00 - bit dodgy
124:02 - uh
124:02 - wall opening
124:06 - click
124:08 - click
124:10 - click there we go so you select the wall
124:14 - and you see then you
124:16 - say from where do you start opening and
124:18 - where do you end so here it's it's a
124:20 - little bit wonky um you can see how what
124:23 - kind of hole it made but we can make a
124:25 - bunch of adjustments uh
124:28 - later um that's that's going to be easy
124:31 - to do
124:32 - and that layer is now actually
124:35 - so let me click on modify
124:37 - and here you can see that i can select
124:40 - the opening the shaft i can indeed
124:42 - select it
124:44 - and i can change its measurements right
124:46 - so here i want a precise measurement of
124:49 - three meters let's see if that's gonna
124:52 - gonna work yeah it is gonna work and i
124:55 - want it to be centered right so that's
124:57 - 103 and that's 97 that doesn't work i'll
125:01 - just do
125:02 - 100 by 100
125:04 - right so 3 meters
125:06 - 10 centimeters 10 centimeters so we have
125:09 - this this opening here
125:11 - and the height of it
125:13 - right
125:14 - i can change the height of it as well so
125:17 - first things first let's check the
125:20 - the bottom
125:22 - so the bottom
125:24 - here the base offset is minus 19.2
125:28 - for some reason i don't want that i will
125:31 - just say base offset is zero hit apply
125:35 - so it gets moved up a bit
125:37 - and then the top
125:39 - offset so that is from the
125:41 - [Music]
125:43 - from the first floor level you can see
125:45 - that top constraint is said to be up to
125:47 - level 3500
125:49 - right so it's it's from this level here
125:52 - um
125:52 - it's being moved down by one point uh
125:55 - [Music]
125:56 - one meter eight centimeters right which
125:59 - is a very weird offset so actually for
126:02 - for this kind of window i will say
126:07 - uh minus
126:09 - minus 500 ml i think that's that's going
126:12 - to be okay
126:14 - so it gets moved closer there we go so
126:16 - we have our our opening here
126:19 - which is ready to
126:21 - uh accept or or
126:24 - now we are ready to put in a curtain
126:26 - wall inside of it
126:29 - the way we do it
126:30 - is we just
126:32 - create a wall
126:35 - we start creating a wall and in the
126:37 - properties you scroll down until you see
126:40 - curtain wall option
126:43 - right and here there's like exterior
126:46 - glazing storefront curtain wall so we
126:48 - will just be creating a regular curtain
126:50 - wall
126:52 - like that
126:54 - um and we will say
126:57 - that wall goes along the center line
126:59 - that's fine
127:02 - [Music]
127:05 - yeah all of that seems okay
127:08 - let's just start drawing it and see what
127:11 - happens right
127:12 - so this is
127:15 - the default settings top constraint
127:17 - unconnected that's fine
127:21 - and let me just try and draw it through
127:23 - the middle point of this wall
127:26 - from here
127:28 - to here
127:31 - there we go okay so that is done
127:34 - um it's basically it just created a
127:37 - single
127:38 - glass panel right now and you can see
127:41 - that that panel doesn't even reach the
127:43 - top so we need to somehow
127:46 - be able to reach
127:49 - apologies
127:50 - we need to reach
127:52 - the top of this hole and the way we do
127:55 - it i believe is by just no we can't well
127:59 - technically we can by just saying that
128:01 - it needs to be up to
128:04 - the first floor level
128:05 - right
128:06 - but the top offset needs to be the same
128:09 - as the top offset of our
128:11 - hole
128:12 - which we used 500 millimeters for right
128:15 - so it goes up to level one
128:18 - uh and the top offset is minus 500
128:22 - millimeters
128:23 - hit apply
128:26 - it didn't change why didn't it change
128:29 - that's because
128:32 - we are still in
128:34 - place wall tool and not edit wall tool
128:38 - that's my bad
128:39 - sorry about that so we actually need to
128:42 - escape out
128:44 - completely so hit escape until you don't
128:46 - have any tools
128:48 - running we need to do that
128:51 - and
128:52 - then we select
128:54 - this glazing
128:56 - wall
128:58 - how is it called curtain wall sorry this
129:00 - curtain wall
129:01 - we selected and then here we can change
129:05 - the settings so that was my bad
129:08 - before i was changing the settings for
129:11 - the next
129:12 - curtain wall that i'm going to be
129:14 - creating
129:15 - so top constraint from unconnected i
129:18 - changed this to first floor
129:20 - and top offset i changed this to minus
129:23 - 500 and now it should be good to go
129:27 - there we go so now it's all tied up
129:30 - okay so we have our
129:33 - uh
129:34 - single
129:35 - glass
129:36 - piece here
129:38 - which is not you know it's okay but it's
129:41 - it's maybe not something that
129:44 - we necessarily want perhaps we want to
129:48 - have a little bit more divisions and so
129:51 - on of course
129:52 - it
129:54 - is it possible to make it like that
129:56 - technically yes but
129:59 - this would cost more than the rest of
130:01 - the building so
130:03 - instead let's let's add a few divisions
130:05 - so i am going to escape out of all of
130:08 - the tools
130:10 - and here in the architecture tab i'll
130:13 - find curtain grid tool
130:17 - so this is going to be
130:18 - actually once i hover my mouse over it
130:20 - it shows what it does it's going to
130:23 - separate
130:24 - the glass panels into
130:27 - a smaller panel right with a grid
130:30 - so curtain grid select that
130:33 - and here in the plan view
130:35 - um
130:36 - i am just going to kind of divide it up
130:39 - and i'm thinking of um
130:42 - perhaps we can do
130:45 - one meter
130:46 - here
130:48 - and one meter here right so two
130:50 - divisions right
130:52 - every one meter
130:54 - like that and then in the
130:58 - let me jump in here in the perspective
131:01 - view
131:03 - i will say that
131:06 - at 2.2
131:08 - meters i also need a division
131:12 - this kind of indicates that i will have
131:14 - the center piece as a doorway i'm able
131:18 - to use it as a doorway and the doorway
131:20 - is not going to be like three meters
131:21 - high
131:22 - which
131:23 - reduces the costs
131:25 - dramatically
131:26 - so
131:28 - once you're done that
131:30 - escape escape
131:33 - hit escape a bunch of times once you've
131:35 - done that you are able to um
131:39 - well you will see that the glass has
131:41 - been separated into parts but there is
131:44 - no framing yet so we need to add the
131:47 - frames
131:48 - and the way you add frames is by
131:51 - creating millions so frames are called
131:54 - millions right
131:56 - i will select that tool mullion
132:00 - like that
132:01 - and it's going to say
132:03 - uh first of all what kind of mullion do
132:05 - do we want right it's going to ask in
132:08 - the properties what kind of million do
132:10 - we want and there's like a bunch of
132:12 - different
132:13 - options
132:14 - 50 by 150 ml is is a pretty
132:18 - intense one i want a little bit thinner
132:21 - one so i'll just use the 30 millimeter
132:23 - square million
132:25 - so that's a cross section it's like
132:26 - three by three centimeters it's super
132:28 - thin it's unrealistically thin but i
132:31 - think that's fine can we add the type of
132:34 - it
132:36 - yeah we can even add a type and we can
132:38 - add any thickness we want but i will
132:40 - stick to
132:42 - to the default one that's that's fine
132:46 - so we have our mullions and then here it
132:49 - asks me to select grid lines right so i
132:51 - can either select grid lines one by one
132:54 - and these divisions are
132:56 - grid lines they are called grid lines
132:59 - i can select them one by one or i can
133:01 - select all of them at the same time
133:04 - so i'm thinking of just
133:06 - going to town and just selecting all of
133:08 - them
133:09 - and clicking
133:10 - so i just selected that tool and clicked
133:13 - on the gridlines and
133:14 - now uh the framing has been placed and
133:17 - you can see it here as well
133:20 - right those those black dots that's
133:22 - that's the framing perhaps um
133:26 - let me undo ctrl z
133:29 - and instead let me actually use the
133:31 - bigger one just so that you can see
133:33 - better uh these these divisions so again
133:36 - i selected the 50 by 150 mil
133:40 - all grid lines
133:41 - select
133:42 - bam big boys
133:45 - right
133:47 - okay so we have our curtain wall here
133:50 - set up
133:56 - you can do the same thing for multiple
134:00 - uh multiple floors as well that's that's
134:03 - fine um you just make a larger shaft
134:07 - actually maybe i should should show you
134:09 - how to do it
134:11 - um
134:14 - can do i show you here or here maybe
134:16 - here
134:17 - let's do a glass facade right in the
134:20 - front of the of the building
134:22 - so i will go to
134:24 - my
134:31 - sorry now i'm just starting to design it
134:34 - i'm trying to figure out
134:36 - a nice
134:39 - nice design for this um
134:42 - so let's say in our first floor
134:46 - ah
134:48 - that's the wrong wrong side
134:50 - and now we need to wait for it to load
134:52 - up so first floor load it up on the
134:54 - right hand side no i want it here
134:57 - so in our first floor i will also create
135:00 - a
135:01 - a shaft opening
135:03 - so sorry a wall opening like that
135:07 - and i will create one from
135:10 - uh
135:10 - on this wall from here
135:13 - to
135:15 - here something like that
135:17 - but this one actually i want to
135:21 - be a little bit
135:23 - less
135:24 - wide
135:25 - so i'll just say
135:27 - something like this
135:28 - perhaps so let's go for 1.5
135:32 - meters
135:33 - that's 1.5 millimeters that's my bad
135:38 - i keep forgetting too that i'm drawing
135:40 - everything in millimeters here
135:42 - um usually in rhino i do block outs in
135:45 - mirrors and then switch to millimeters
135:48 - once i do a
135:50 - detailed project
135:51 - 1500 right
135:54 - and this dimension needs to be zero
135:57 - uh can't keep elements joined
136:00 - that's fine i will just say unjoin
136:02 - elements
136:04 - ah but then it makes that mistake huh
136:07 - so this is where it it starts becoming a
136:09 - little bit
136:13 - just your
136:14 - regular revit things right uh let me
136:17 - undo
136:18 - and here instead of zero
136:22 - oops
136:25 - here instead of in this case instead of
136:27 - 300 millimeters let me write 500
136:30 - something like that so we have a 20
136:32 - centimeter gap here i think that's fine
136:36 - um let me while i'm at it let me make
136:38 - another shaft here
136:41 - from here
136:47 - let's see
136:48 - can i type in
136:50 - 500
136:53 - oh
136:54 - yes i can but it lags
136:57 - so this is another way of how i'm
136:59 - creating shaft so while i'm still in
137:00 - shaft creation tool
137:03 - i am able to kind of continue
137:06 - adding shafts to this
137:10 - but it's not being cooperative at all oh
137:14 - that's
137:16 - that's my bad
137:18 - so
137:19 - i forgot that i'm creating a wall
137:21 - opening and not a shaft so i
137:23 - accidentally cut away from the floors
137:27 - not from the wall
137:28 - oopsie
137:29 - control z
137:30 - uh
137:32 - disregard
137:34 - yes
137:35 - save the project sure okay we're back
137:38 - i'm ah
137:39 - sorry
137:40 - let me just create a wall opening not a
137:43 - shaft opening i will show you how to
137:45 - create a shaft opening in just a second
137:46 - but now we are just creating wall
137:48 - openings
137:50 - like that
137:51 - modify select this and here we just
137:54 - start typing in the dimensions so this
137:57 - one is going to be like 600 mil
138:01 - and it's going to be
138:05 - let's say
138:07 - or actually here
138:09 - this dimension is going to be 200 mil
138:11 - away
138:12 - something like that yeah i think that's
138:14 - gonna look okay
138:16 - and now it's just the height right i
138:18 - need to
138:21 - i i need to fix the height of it so
138:26 - i'm just going to
138:27 - select the first shaft opening and i'm
138:30 - going to say that the top constraint of
138:32 - it is up to
138:34 - the third floor
138:36 - like that
138:37 - and the top offset is
138:39 - um
138:41 - let's go for zero
138:43 - hit apply
138:49 - doesn't cut huh
138:51 - that's weird
138:53 - i wonder why
138:54 - perhaps it's because i made it in
139:01 - wait
139:03 - yeah that's
139:05 - understood that's because
139:07 - these are two separate walls
139:09 - right
139:10 - and this guy
139:12 - this shaft opening can only cut through
139:14 - the one so that but that's that's not a
139:16 - problem i will just
139:19 - move it down and i will say that the
139:22 - the constraint is the second floor top
139:24 - offset is
139:27 - zero
139:28 - apply hit apply
139:30 - same thing for this one
139:32 - not for this one or
139:37 - for this one top offset
139:39 - zero
139:41 - apply
139:42 - there we go and now we just need these
139:45 - two uh shaft openings to go to
139:48 - the second floor as well
139:51 - so i'm just going to do it manually
139:55 - real fast
139:57 - so let me jump to the second floor
140:00 - that's 20
140:01 - that's 20 that's 60. don't remember this
140:04 - one but we'll figure it out
140:07 - uh should be good
140:08 - uh so let me just drag this one in here
140:11 - second floor
140:13 - there we go
140:14 - and i'll do this as fast as i can once
140:17 - this stops lagging
140:20 - while opening
140:22 - on this wall from here
140:24 - to here
140:26 - from here
140:27 - to here okay we have two wall openings
140:30 - this one is
140:32 - 200 mil this one is probably thousand
140:35 - five hundred
140:37 - um oh so that then it changes this
140:40 - 200
140:42 - and this one
140:43 - i don't know
140:44 - i don't know
140:45 - this dimension but that's fine because
140:47 - we will get it by changing this
140:50 - so this one is 600
140:54 - that is 200
140:55 - and then automatically that dimension
140:57 - kind of locks in place
140:59 - in being 700 so
141:02 - now we have one more shaft
141:04 - that's great
141:06 - and all we need to do is just
141:09 - say that top offset of it is zero
141:13 - like that
141:15 - and that our top offset is zero as well
141:19 - apply
141:21 - uh
141:23 - why is this higher than oh this one is
141:26 - also that uh so sorry we need to
141:30 - move it down a bit because we are
141:33 - going into the floor slab
141:35 - so the floor slab is
141:38 - 150 millimeters wide or or thick so the
141:42 - top offset actually needs to be minus
141:46 - 150
141:47 - apply
141:48 - so that we're not going into the floor
141:52 - slab um
141:54 - this one come on come on just let me
141:57 - there we go
141:59 - minus 150.
142:01 - okay so here we have our shaft openings
142:04 - and i'm just going to jump back into
142:06 - first floor where i'm just going to
142:08 - create
142:11 - the the curtain wall again wall
142:14 - architectural
142:16 - curtain wall
142:17 - from here
142:19 - to here and then from here to here
142:23 - right so we have our our walls
142:26 - modify
142:27 - um
142:30 - so
142:31 - sometimes it creates a wall inwards in
142:34 - inside like
142:36 - in in the wrong
142:38 - direction so the way you fix it is by
142:41 - you don't really see it on the screen
142:43 - but there are two arrows here
142:46 - which let you change the orientation of
142:49 - the wall right so you can switch them up
142:52 - so i'll do that i will switch the
142:54 - orientation of these walls uh then i
142:57 - just need to
142:59 - for the first one i just i will just go
143:02 - to top constraint and see that actually
143:04 - it's to the third floor not the second
143:07 - floor and the top offset is actually
143:10 - minus 150
143:12 - due to the thickness of the floor slab
143:15 - same thing for here
143:18 - top offset minus 150
143:21 - up to level
143:24 - three
143:25 - apply
143:26 - there we go so we have our two
143:30 - curtain walls set up now all i need to
143:33 - do is just just add a grid again to them
143:40 - um so here i'll just add one division
143:43 - one vertical division here i don't need
143:44 - to add any vertical divisions
143:46 - right
143:48 - and then i'll jump into 3d and just
143:51 - hovering my mouse over the
143:54 - vertical edge of the curtain the curtain
143:57 - wall i am able to add horizontal
144:00 - divisions
144:02 - so i'll probably add
144:07 - probably add a division here thousand
144:09 - five hundred
144:11 - year thousand five hundred
144:14 - and
144:16 - it doesn't really let me add 1500 here
144:20 - but this seems okay
144:22 - um and then same thing here a thousand
144:24 - five hundred thousand five hundred
144:27 - bam 1500
144:28 - or
144:30 - 1425 that's fine
144:32 - so we have our grids set up
144:35 - and then i'll go to modify tab or to
144:38 - i'll click on the modify button
144:40 - i'll click on million and do the same
144:43 - thing you know rectangular million
144:45 - all grid lines i'll choose the button
144:48 - that says all grid lines
144:50 - and see that all of these need
144:52 - rectangular millions right
144:55 - and these also need rectangular moles
145:00 - so now
145:02 - all of this
145:04 - is kind of done it's kind of set up
145:07 - right
145:08 - we have our
145:11 - uh our
145:12 - facade
145:13 - done
145:17 - last thing that i want to do i will not
145:19 - be messing around with the back side
145:21 - back side would also probably i would
145:23 - add a curtain grid of some sort
145:27 - i will instead just add a doorway and a
145:30 - window here in the in the top
145:33 - so let me go to the
145:36 - let's go here let me go to the
145:39 - third floor
145:50 - come on load up there we go
145:53 - third floor
145:56 - bam bam bam
146:00 - still loading there we go
146:02 - door
146:04 - regular door just add it
146:08 - probably
146:12 - 600 ml again something like that
146:16 - so we have our door and then
146:19 - click on modify window
146:21 - add a window also like a narrow window
146:25 - um 300 millimeters away from the door
146:29 - like that what the hell was uh well it
146:32 - worked out
146:34 - so the window is slightly too low uh we
146:37 - will fix that by just adjusting the
146:41 - head height two one three five um for
146:45 - for this window is actually it needs to
146:48 - be to 185 that's what we remember from
146:51 - our previous insertion of of this window
146:55 - that's it right that's that's it we
146:58 - have um some sort of a facade it's not
147:01 - the greatest
147:02 - for sure
147:03 - but
147:04 - you know it's
147:06 - okay
147:07 - it's good enough to show you the the
147:10 - tools
147:11 - um so that is that
147:14 - now let's
147:15 - look at how can we add
147:19 - in
147:20 - door doors doorways inside of the
147:23 - building
147:25 - um
147:27 - not put doorways walls walls and stairs
147:30 - inside of the building so i'll go back
147:32 - to ground floor
147:34 - and i'll add a staircase first so that's
147:36 - the first thing that i'm going to do
147:39 - is add the staircase so
147:41 - this is going to be a little bit
147:44 - more tricky
147:46 - not not necessarily tricky but um
147:49 - i will
147:51 - go to the architecture tab and i'll
147:53 - choose stair
147:56 - here and here is the stair creation tool
148:01 - right so i am able to
148:04 - either create a straight staircase
148:07 - which is just straight up
148:09 - that and by the way given the height of
148:12 - each step and so on
148:16 - and the width of each step it
148:18 - automatically knows how long the
148:20 - staircase is going to
148:22 - be
148:24 - and here our um
148:27 - this is our
148:29 - settings
148:31 - right
148:32 - so right now desired number of steps is
148:36 - 19 so this is how many steps we want and
148:40 - actual thread depth is 25 so it's only
148:44 - 25 centimeters really
148:48 - maybe that's fine um
148:50 - i like doing 28 centimeters for for for
148:54 - the threads but this is a pretty small
148:57 - house so 25 is okay and then it
149:00 - automatically
149:01 - automatically calculates
149:03 - what's going to be the riser height so
149:05 - that's one point
149:07 - sorry that's 18 centimeters which is
149:10 - fine
149:11 - uh 18 is okay
149:14 - so usually it's 17.5 but again this is a
149:17 - small house so when we just do a regular
149:20 - straight staircase it's it's pretty
149:22 - straightforward right we just
149:25 - i can say run is
149:28 - location of the line is on the left hand
149:31 - side of the run and i can just oops
149:34 - not the left hand side right hand side
149:37 - run right
149:39 - from here
149:40 - to here bam that's it that's that's a
149:43 - staircase
149:45 - i can even show it to you here
149:48 - no i can't i need a section
149:51 - to be able to show you
149:53 - um can we do a section no we can't while
149:56 - we are
149:58 - while we are running the staircase the
150:01 - stair tool
150:02 - so let me open up the building a bit so
150:05 - that you can see better what what's
150:07 - going on
150:08 - so again stair
150:10 - cancel
150:11 - ground floor
150:14 - so
150:15 - notice how that menu popped up that was
150:18 - because i was in 3d view instead i will
150:21 - create a ground floor
150:23 - the staircase and ground floor view so
150:25 - then it won't even ask me any questions
150:28 - so it's there from here to ah run on the
150:32 - right
150:33 - from here to here
150:35 - bam
150:37 - just creates a staircase so there's no
150:39 - opening and so on but that's fine that's
150:41 - that's something that we will
150:43 - we will easily
150:45 - easily fix
150:49 - okay
150:50 - so that is a very
150:54 - simple staircase without any risers
150:57 - without sorry without any landings
150:59 - without anything like that so let me
151:01 - delete it and instead let's see other
151:04 - variations of the staircase that we can
151:06 - do we can do full step spiral
151:09 - so that's that was the straight
151:10 - staircase we can do a full step spiral
151:12 - which is basically just
151:17 - there we go
151:18 - here it fits
151:20 - right so it just generates a spiral
151:22 - staircase nothing nothing fancy about it
151:26 - um
151:28 - not really sure
151:29 - how
151:31 - how it can be used in this particular
151:35 - project because it eats up so much space
151:39 - but it is there
151:41 - then you have center and spiral uh which
151:44 - is basically
151:46 - you describe the center point
151:49 - you and then you describe the end point
151:52 - and you can do
151:54 - you know you you do the spiral staircase
151:56 - so it looks the same but
151:59 - if i were to repeat it and if i were to
152:02 - say
152:04 - um something like
152:05 - this
152:07 - and then
152:09 - repeat it again
152:11 - oh my god this is
152:13 - annoying
152:15 - ah let's just do it this way repeat it
152:17 - again and see something like this
152:20 - bam or
152:22 - fine
152:23 - oh my god
152:26 - i can't fit it properly so i'm
152:28 - struggling with it let's let's try it
152:30 - again
152:31 - uh that's going to be our center point
152:34 - and we will start from here
152:38 - half a turn
152:39 - like that
152:40 - and then
152:42 - this is going to be our center point we
152:44 - will start from here
152:47 - and another half a turn so it's going to
152:50 - make this kind of a this kind of a
152:52 - staircase
152:54 - which uh yep
152:57 - it is how it is it looks how it looks i
153:00 - know but
153:04 - um let me just delete it so that you
153:07 - don't need to look at it
153:09 - uh automatically
153:11 - whatever
153:13 - okay
153:14 - so then we have l form staircase which
153:17 - is
153:18 - quite
153:19 - quite convenient but it's basically just
153:21 - drag and drop and then once you drag it
153:24 - dragged and dropped it you will need to
153:26 - align it with with the walls of course
153:30 - so to align you can either rotate it so
153:33 - you select the tool or the thing and you
153:35 - rotate it
153:41 - like that
153:43 - right
153:44 - that's super super simple or or there is
153:48 - an option for aligning
153:51 - a line
153:53 - so it's going to ask you to give it a
153:55 - reference line so let's see this line
153:58 - and it's going to ask you to give it a
154:01 - alignment line so this line here let's
154:03 - see
154:06 - or that yeah there we go so first it's
154:08 - the alignment line and then there's the
154:09 - reference line and it's just going to
154:11 - snap to snap to place
154:14 - also kind of kind of useful uh
154:16 - especially in these kind of uh kind of
154:19 - houses because then you can
154:21 - um
154:22 - move through
154:24 - move below the the staircase
154:27 - so that might be something that you
154:29 - would like to look into
154:31 - um last one that i am going to cover is
154:34 - the
154:35 - u-shape
154:37 - winder i guess
154:39 - uh so it's basically this kind of
154:41 - staircase
154:43 - right again it this one is just drag and
154:46 - drop and again i will just use align
154:49 - tool click
154:50 - click to just snap it to place
154:55 - easy
154:56 - um
154:57 - right
154:58 - so that's uh that's the staircases uh
155:01 - the default staircases rather so then
155:03 - you have the possibility to make your
155:05 - own uh well not make your own but draw
155:07 - your own staircase which i really
155:10 - enjoy
155:12 - so you can create runs
155:14 - landings
155:16 - and support systems which we don't care
155:18 - about so run
155:20 - is basically
155:21 - let's say i want
155:24 - my first run to be
155:27 - only two meters long
155:30 - and i want my second run
155:33 - to be
155:34 - let's take let's say it starts from here
155:38 - and goes um
155:40 - on the left hand side and goes until
155:43 - let's see only for a meter like that
155:46 - and then i have my third run which is on
155:49 - the right so you keep switching between
155:51 - left right level light to goes like so
155:56 - it's no problem it's going to do it
155:58 - right it's it's not going to
156:01 - be tricky at all uh it's going to
156:03 - automatically connect the staircases
156:06 - with the runs
156:08 - sometimes it doesn't
156:11 - so if it doesn't let's see if if there
156:14 - is a disconnect between
156:17 - this
156:19 - let me show you here
156:22 - in 3d as well if there is a disconnect
156:24 - between this run and this run
156:26 - right
156:27 - i can
156:29 - draw a landing
156:31 - either by hand or by specifying
156:34 - that yo please connect
156:36 - this
156:39 - this and this
156:41 - right
156:42 - so just click click and it will connect
156:44 - them with a run or if i want a fancy
156:47 - some sort of fancy shape for for my my
156:51 - landing
156:52 - then i can create a sketch
156:55 - create a sketch
156:57 - and then just draw it out so i will just
157:00 - say
157:03 - i want my landing to be a beautiful
157:08 - little
157:11 - form
157:14 - like
157:16 - this
157:18 - come on
157:19 - snap
157:21 - there we go
157:23 - bam
157:24 - just make sure that it's a closed uh
157:27 - holy line
157:28 - hit apply
157:30 - bam that's that's your that's your
157:32 - landing and right now it's not tied to
157:36 - your stairs so you would need to
157:39 - actually
157:40 - uh
157:41 - change the relative height of it so that
157:44 - it is indeed
157:46 - tied
157:47 - with with the steps so um you can do
157:50 - that by calculating
157:52 - um
157:53 - the the height of each step and kind of
157:56 - getting the the correct
157:58 - value for it
157:59 - i think like let's say
158:01 - 2500 here apply
158:06 - yeah that's close enough
158:09 - that's close enough
158:10 - so you end up with this kind of a weird
158:13 - run where it may it does make mistakes
158:15 - here
158:16 - uh it doesn't feel it
158:18 - fill it in or anything like that but
158:21 - it is a possibility
158:23 - let me delete that
158:25 - um yeah that's that's about it in in
158:27 - terms of stairs so let me just create a
158:30 - super simple one right now
158:32 - just a
158:34 - straight staircase
158:36 - um and here
158:38 - when i'm going to be creating it i'll
158:40 - just go through the
158:44 - go through the the settings and here i
158:48 - kind of want to do let's see
158:51 - what kind of monolithic staircase how
158:52 - does that look like
158:57 - yeah so i i do
158:59 - like the monolithic staircase type
159:02 - because it's super simple right
159:06 - it does exactly what i want it to do
159:08 - it's it's a super simple staircase so
159:11 - let's let's do it and i'll just do a
159:13 - straight line for it
159:16 - so let's see a person who walks in
159:19 - um
159:20 - hangs his or her coat and then is a
159:23 - staircase waiting for them
159:25 - uh on this side so i just want to give
159:28 - them like 1.5 let's say mirrors of space
159:32 - to move
159:34 - uh 1.5 there we go space to move uh
159:38 - along so so that there is like a
159:42 - there's no awkward awkward moments here
159:46 - uh the width of the staircase is one
159:48 - mirror um i can change it here if i want
159:51 - to but i think for something like this
159:54 - one meter is a okay there's no railing
159:57 - but
159:59 - you can add railing
160:01 - uh to the staircase
160:03 - um
160:04 - by just clicking this this button
160:07 - railing
160:09 - uh where you kind of choose what kind of
160:12 - type of railing you want
160:14 - um
160:14 - [Music]
160:16 - i don't know what's default
160:19 - let's see
160:20 - ma'am
160:22 - hello railing
160:28 - that's weird let me just accept
160:32 - this ah okay so it it did create railing
160:37 - once i have accepted the staircase so
160:40 - this kind of railing is super ugly and i
160:43 - don't like it
160:45 - so if if you don't want the railing you
160:48 - can always
160:51 - delete it
160:53 - straight up
160:54 - just delete it
160:56 - that fixes your
160:58 - your problem of not having a nice
160:59 - railing but now you have another problem
161:02 - which is people falling down your stairs
161:05 - so to fix it let's say uh i will just
161:09 - make a a wall here right
161:12 - for for the staircase i'll just make a
161:14 - wall i'll just put it in the wall
161:16 - the gallery owner needs a wall either
161:19 - way so might as well do it for them
161:24 - so i will
161:26 - create a wall
161:28 - and it's not going to be a curtain wall
161:29 - it's going to be an interior wall uh one
161:32 - three eight millimeter seems fine
161:35 - uh that's a partitioning wall and just
161:37 - create one here uh
161:39 - that is not going to be a center line i
161:42 - don't i can't have it as a center line
161:46 - finish face exterior probably
161:49 - nope i was wrong
161:52 - finish face interior
161:54 - like that
161:55 - so you always kind of mess around with
161:57 - the alignment alignment of the walls
162:02 - so i think that
162:03 - and then that
162:05 - should be a okay
162:08 - enter
162:10 - so we have this kind of a
162:13 - weird awkward interior wall here but we
162:17 - will fix it by just selecting it holding
162:20 - down the control key selecting both of
162:22 - them
162:23 - um and then just saying top constraint
162:26 - is up to
162:28 - the first floor and top offset is
162:32 - minus 150.
162:35 - the reason why it's minus 150 is because
162:37 - of the
162:38 - thickness of the floor slab
162:43 - okay great
162:45 - now we have
162:50 - now now we have some
162:54 - some walls here and i will probably
162:57 - just add
162:59 - architecture door just because i
163:02 - want to i'll just add a door here
163:07 - like that
163:10 - because you kind of want to
163:12 - use up the space
163:14 - below the
163:17 - the staircase for storage
163:20 - so we have that and that is uh good
163:23 - enough for
163:25 - or for paintings to hang and you kind of
163:28 - just you're you're not losing uh surface
163:31 - area for the gallery
163:34 - and that's that's the key i guess
163:37 - um
163:39 - okay
163:40 - so now
163:41 - one last thing
163:43 - just one last thing is that the
163:45 - staircases uh
163:47 - they don't go anywhere right once they
163:49 - reach the second floor they you just
163:51 - bump your head
163:53 - or the first floor you just bump your
163:54 - head
163:55 - uh we need to make a hole in the
163:58 - first floor to let the staircase in
164:02 - and to do that i will just
164:05 - go to first floor
164:08 - right here
164:09 - i can see that the staircase ends here
164:12 - that's perfect
164:13 - uh and i will create a shaft opening
164:18 - so i can either create a shaft opening
164:21 - or i can change the boundary of the
164:24 - floor itself
164:26 - let me show you both variations on how
164:29 - to do it so let's say the first
164:31 - variation is changing the boundary of
164:33 - the floor
164:35 - right
164:36 - so actually changing it in this section
164:39 - sometimes it's kind of hard to select
164:41 - the floor slab
164:42 - so i'll just do it in 3d view selecting
164:46 - the floor slab there and then continue
164:48 - working in the plan view
164:51 - so we are going to change the boundary
164:54 - of this floor slab so if i click on edit
164:57 - boundary
164:58 - right here
165:01 - i can
165:02 - draw
165:04 - lines so the pink line here is the
165:07 - boundary of our floor
165:08 - but if i let's say take a let's go for a
165:12 - circle circle tool and just draw out a
165:15 - circle right in the middle of the
165:17 - boundary and hit accept
165:20 - um
165:20 - [Music]
165:23 - this is
165:24 - what's going to happen right it's going
165:26 - to make a hole uh off of that circle so
165:30 - let me come back here
165:32 - or rather undo ctrl z
165:35 - um and ctrl z once more to
165:39 - undo the the circle and instead let me
165:42 - draw out
165:43 - the opening for the staircase
165:46 - so this is 3.5 meters
165:49 - right
165:51 - the ceiling height is 3.5 meters so that
165:55 - means if
165:58 - if we kind of climb up to the half of
166:00 - the stairs
166:02 - it's 1.75
166:05 - meters of of clearance so that's not
166:08 - good that means we need
166:10 - um
166:12 - at least
166:14 - three more steps
166:16 - uh for for the clearance to be
166:19 - okay so that we don't bump our heads so
166:22 - i'm
166:22 - guessing if this is the middle
166:26 - if this line if it's the middle of the
166:28 - staircase i'm guessing up until here we
166:31 - need an opening
166:33 - so let me just and that's good that we
166:34 - have an arrow just kind of showing us
166:36 - that um so let me just grab a line tool
166:40 - and just draw
166:42 - one
166:42 - two
166:43 - three
166:44 - four
166:45 - five
166:46 - just kind of clicking five times to draw
166:49 - this rectangle hitting accept
166:52 - would you like walls that go up to this
166:54 - floor level to attach to its bottom
166:58 - would you like walls
167:01 - that go up
167:03 - to this floor's level to attach to its
167:05 - bottom
167:06 - nah don't attach don't don't don't care
167:09 - don't care
167:10 - um
167:11 - and yeah we have our opening now
167:15 - right with with our steps
167:17 - there is
167:18 - a little bit of a gap there why is there
167:22 - a gap there
167:27 - ah that's because of the discrepancy of
167:30 - of the riser height so it couldn't fit
167:34 - perfectly
167:35 - but
167:36 - oh or maybe it could
167:39 - no it could because this height is the
167:41 - same as this height okay so that's
167:44 - sorry that that was my bad it's all good
167:47 - it's all good
167:48 - so we have
167:50 - an opening for our staircase the problem
167:52 - now is you know and you kind of continue
167:54 - working on it the problem now is that
167:57 - you can fall down here right in the in
167:59 - the into this hole so we need to build
168:02 - up
168:04 - some
168:08 - some walls
168:10 - yeah sure save project always save your
168:13 - projects by the way so we need to build
168:16 - up some walls
168:18 - from here to here
168:20 - to maybe here
168:23 - just like that
168:24 - enter
168:26 - and then i'm just going to modify
168:30 - select these two walls holding down the
168:32 - control key and say that it's actually
168:34 - connected to the second floor and the
168:37 - top offset is again -150
168:39 - apply
168:42 - perfect
168:45 - so now
168:47 - if i make a section through the stair
168:50 - steps
168:51 - steps
168:52 - i can see
168:53 - you know how exactly this whole thing
168:56 - works
168:58 - right
169:00 - so we're we're making progress right so
169:02 - we can access the first floor and now we
169:06 - have access to the
169:07 - to the second floor
169:10 - and then
169:11 - of course you would need to figure out a
169:13 - way of how to access the third floor
169:16 - and all of that good stuff
169:19 - it would probably be some sort of uh
169:22 - actually let me
169:24 - let me just show you just so that you
169:27 - uh
169:28 - get a sense of of how i'm i'm thinking
169:30 - when i'm doing these things
169:34 - so you arrive here right that's that's
169:36 - your arrival point in the second floor
169:40 - in the first floor sorry from the ground
169:42 - floor uh so that's your arrival point
169:44 - and then you choose to either go up
169:47 - again or to go into
169:50 - this space right so that means it makes
169:53 - sense uh to have a staircase winding
169:56 - around here
169:58 - right
170:00 - doing a u-shaped wind here so i'll
170:02 - create a stair
170:03 - uh cast in place there moletics there
170:05 - that's perfect and i will give it a
170:08 - first run after one meter
170:11 - i'll give it the first run
170:14 - of four steps
170:17 - right here so there is like a gap
170:20 - right here
170:21 - then i will give it
170:24 - uh
170:27 - four more steps here fail to generate
170:29 - automatic landing layout that's fine
170:32 - we'll just move uh these steps away a
170:35 - little bit and it will generate the
170:38 - landing
170:39 - and then the rest is going to be
170:41 - generated here
170:43 - can't make stair stairs
170:47 - uh
170:48 - why
170:53 - cancel
170:55 - cool
170:58 - welcome to revit
171:00 - okay we try again
171:02 - steps
171:04 - this time um
171:08 - let's let's say
171:10 - only three steps here two three no
171:15 - uh a bit closer
171:17 - three steps here
171:19 - then
171:23 - four steps here
171:25 - and then the remaining ones are
171:29 - here
171:31 - can't make stairs
171:33 - why
171:43 - why are you complaining about this
171:48 - cancel
171:50 - okay let me
171:51 - do
171:53 - let me not snap to this
171:55 - edge here maybe it's it doesn't like it
171:58 - and instead snap to
172:00 - like align it with these steps here
172:04 - like that
172:06 - maybe that's yeah okay so that works uh
172:09 - just try until it works
172:12 - that's that's the answer
172:14 - um
172:16 - yeah and that is basically it then then
172:18 - i just hit accept like finish editing
172:22 - bam it creates these railings which we
172:24 - just get rid of
172:27 - like that and now we have our steps to
172:30 - the second floor and the second floor
172:33 - also doesn't have a hole in it right so
172:35 - we need to create a hole for or the
172:38 - second floor
172:39 - uh to do that i will actually show you
172:43 - the other way of how to do it with the
172:45 - shaft so i will go to my second floor
172:50 - that's great
172:51 - that's where the steps are and i will
172:54 - create a shaft opening
172:57 - so i clicked on the shaft option there
173:00 - and the shaft opening basically just
173:02 - asks me to draw a boundary line
173:05 - again
173:06 - so i'm just drawing a line
173:10 - probably something like that
173:13 - yeah let's yolo it
173:16 - something like that
173:17 - accept
173:18 - bam
173:20 - we have our opening and yep the shaft
173:24 - just ate up the
173:26 - floor above as well so we need to change
173:29 - uh the height of the shaft and the cool
173:32 - thing about is is that with the shaft
173:34 - tool you can just kind of go to 3d and
173:37 - just drag it down
173:39 - you know so that it doesn't reach
173:42 - the that floor and you're you're you're
173:44 - good to go
173:46 - so you just kind of drag down the top
173:47 - face of the shaft
173:50 - um that's it about and of course you
173:53 - would need to add the walls there and
173:55 - then so on and kind of
173:57 - mess around with the railing here
174:00 - uh perhaps i shouldn't have deleted the
174:02 - railing there but
174:04 - who cares um
174:07 - right
174:09 - so we covered walls we covered glazing
174:12 - curtain systems curtain panels
174:15 - we cover doors windows
174:18 - uh columns are boring um architectural
174:22 - column you can just
174:24 - kind of place a column anywhere you want
174:26 - bam
174:27 - there's a column
174:29 - for some reason there's two
174:31 - never mind there's only one so you can
174:34 - place columns but i don't think you will
174:36 - need any columns in this kind of a
174:38 - building
174:39 - you have ceilings we don't care about
174:41 - ceilings floors okay we have
174:45 - done all of this all of this
174:50 - grid is done
174:51 - [Music]
174:54 - super okay we are done with this part of
174:57 - the tutorial next time i will show you
175:00 - how to actually get
175:03 - drawings out you know it's going to be
175:05 - the final tutorial so
175:06 - everything that
175:08 - that i've missed i will
175:10 - show you how to do it
175:13 - um
175:14 - how do i say it get to work so to begin
175:18 - we have covered walls doors windows all
175:22 - of that good stuff
175:23 - and the only thing left is
175:26 - furniture and i'm not going to be
175:28 - detailing this this project
175:30 - to
175:31 - you know to its full potential so to say
175:34 - uh this is just for me to show you um
175:37 - the different components so it's not
175:39 - going to be
175:40 - in my case it's not going to be a
175:42 - finished project but for you as students
175:44 - i
175:45 - expect you
175:46 - to
175:48 - kind of do and do a full project
175:50 - um
175:51 - right so let's begin
175:54 - the thing is
175:56 - that with
175:57 - revit 2021
176:00 - uh there are
176:02 - there isn't a lot of
176:04 - objects or a lot of furniture pieces
176:07 - that you can natively
176:09 - get into your project if i go here to
176:11 - component
176:13 - right if i click on this component icon
176:17 - i can see here that there are some desks
176:20 - that i can choose from there's a parking
176:22 - space
176:23 - some trees
176:27 - and that's basically it that that's
176:29 - basically it uh from from the default
176:33 - um
176:35 - like default library
176:38 - so it's not
176:40 - it's far from being a big library
176:43 - uh so how do you get more stuff in here
176:46 - um well there is this button here called
176:50 - load family
176:52 - if you press it it will open up a
176:54 - browser for you a file browser and from
176:57 - here you
176:59 - if you have an older version of revit
177:01 - you would be able to choose
177:04 - a furniture piece or or like you would
177:06 - be be able to navigate through the
177:09 - library of furniture pieces
177:12 - uh but here it's just structural precast
177:15 - and some some weird stuff so
177:17 - i don't have anything here so how do you
177:20 - get
177:21 - a library in revit 2021
177:24 - how do you get a library in here well
177:27 - you need to go to let me first escape
177:30 - out of this tool there we go and you
177:32 - need to go to
177:34 - insert
177:37 - and click on load family
177:40 - and those of you who are working on the
177:43 - school's computers i will be able to i
177:46 - believe you will find the library
177:48 - already installed but those of you who
177:50 - are working from home
177:52 - this is what you need to do especially
177:54 - with the new revit
177:56 - click on get autodesk content
177:59 - right here
178:00 - which will open up
178:02 - you can see it there we go it will open
178:04 - up a browser page uh for you
178:07 - uh where you can get where you can
178:10 - download
178:11 - uh the the
178:13 - content so this is the the library of
178:16 - furniture and whatnot um and that kind
178:19 - of content is
178:21 - split
178:22 - into different regions so english united
178:25 - states english united kingdom and if we
178:27 - scroll down far far down
178:30 - you will see english sweden
178:32 - right and here there there are these uh
178:37 - uh swedish libraries which you can
178:39 - install but there are only 15 megabytes
178:42 - which tells me that there's not a lot of
178:44 - stuff in there right so instead what i'm
178:47 - going to do
178:49 - i'm going to actually download the
178:53 - english united states metric libraries
178:56 - which is 1.2 gigabytes right much larger
179:00 - so that means much more stuff for me to
179:03 - play with so i'll click on this
179:06 - and it will immediately start
179:07 - downloading
179:09 - if it doesn't you might need to sign in
179:11 - but
179:12 - it seems like i haven't signed in so it
179:14 - should be fine right so i'll wait for it
179:17 - to
179:18 - finish downloading uh install it and
179:21 - then we will take a look at
179:23 - [Music]
179:24 - how to get them into your file so just a
179:27 - second
179:29 - actually
179:31 - actually to save time
179:34 - while it's downloading i will be messing
179:36 - around with
179:37 - with the furniture here
179:40 - so
179:40 - with the furniture that i have so in
179:43 - architecture tab i'll click on the
179:44 - component tab and i'll see
179:46 - yeah sure this desk uh pretty ugly one
179:49 - but who cares
179:51 - basically adding a disk is just as easy
179:53 - as going to let's see the ground floor
179:57 - zooming in
180:00 - and
180:01 - hello oh right uh so if you change views
180:04 - it will
180:07 - it it will ask you to to run the command
180:10 - again so i'll click on component desk
180:13 - and here i just
180:15 - can click and place the desk
180:18 - uh
180:19 - okay so it's thinking let's hope it's
180:22 - not gonna crash it didn't so okay so we
180:24 - we have a desk in here and i can place
180:27 - another one if i want to
180:29 - whatever
180:30 - so i have two desks here if i check it
180:32 - in 3d view i can see those two desks
180:34 - being displayed here even being cut one
180:37 - of them is being cut so
180:40 - let me go back to the ground floor
180:43 - delete one of those desks
180:45 - and this one
180:47 - what can you do with it well you can
180:48 - move it around of course
180:50 - you can rotate it so that's the rotate
180:53 - button right here
180:55 - right
180:56 - so
180:57 - from here
180:59 - to here
181:00 - you can rotate it let me undo that
181:03 - and you can align it as well so this
181:06 - desk
181:06 - i will click on the alignment tool
181:11 - choose let's see this wall here
181:13 - this disk
181:16 - line here and it's going to snap in
181:19 - place it's going to be aligned so that
181:21 - means now i can kind of move it
181:25 - okay let me escape out there we go now i
181:28 - can move it and place it properly
181:31 - on my
181:33 - inside of my building
181:35 - uh let's see it in 3d yeah that's how it
181:37 - is um if you don't see a line here
181:41 - um just like i don't uh that means your
181:44 - desk is clipping into it's it's being
181:46 - pushed into the wall a little bit
181:49 - that's fine
181:50 - what we can do is in ground floor we
181:52 - just move it slightly away from the wall
181:56 - one
181:57 - just slightly there we go 10 centimeters
181:59 - that's maybe a little bit too much
182:03 - i zoomed in too far so now we need to
182:04 - wait for it to
182:06 - do its
182:08 - thing i don't know what it's doing but
182:11 - yeah there we go so here now once i
182:13 - selected it i can see the dimension here
182:15 - saying a hundred millimeters i can
182:17 - change this to 50
182:20 - right so it's only five centimeters away
182:22 - from the wall
182:23 - perfect
182:24 - if i
182:25 - go to 3d view i can now see that that
182:28 - line is present
182:31 - oh that's an ugly desk let me just
182:33 - delete it
182:34 - okay
182:36 - is it done yet
182:39 - yes it is okay so once you have
182:41 - downloaded the exe file i'll just run it
182:45 - so it's opening it up
182:50 - revit is famous for being super slow and
182:53 - installing stuff but it seems to be
182:55 - doing the trick let me hit extract
182:59 - and it should be
183:00 - yeah it's fine so it's now it's
183:02 - extracting all of the
183:04 - material that i have downloaded
183:09 - uh
183:10 - taking super long but
183:13 - come on come on
183:17 - not not the best thing for for a
183:19 - tutorial to wait for things to extract
183:22 - but
183:23 - who cares it's just like 15 seconds 20
183:26 - seconds
183:27 - a minute maybe
183:33 - perfect time for a coffee break
183:35 - um while it's extracting actually it
183:38 - should be already loading in the
183:42 - the files and
183:43 - let me just make sure
183:46 - 2021 autodesk folder okay so it should
183:49 - be extracting into the correct folder so
183:52 - let me jump back to ground floor
183:54 - go to
183:56 - architecture tab component
183:59 - and click on load family
184:03 - here
184:05 - and let me find english not english
184:08 - imperial but english
184:11 - oh yeah there we go so there's now a lot
184:13 - of folders in here which is great
184:17 - and they are being
184:21 - some files could not be created please
184:22 - close all applications or between this
184:24 - and restart this installation yeah sure
184:26 - so basically what it's saying is you
184:28 - shouldn't be running
184:30 - you shouldn't be loading in the
184:31 - libraries
184:33 - while you are extracting the libraries
184:35 - we don't care we have
184:37 - quite a few already installed this is
184:39 - going to be enough
184:41 - to
184:42 - get the point across
184:45 - so let me repeat that step
184:47 - just to make sure that you all follow
184:50 - i clicked on
184:52 - components
184:55 - icon and then clicked on load family and
184:57 - here i'm in english imperial library so
185:00 - i just moved up one folder
185:03 - and found my english
185:05 - regular english folder
185:07 - which is metric and here we have
185:10 - different kinds of windows for instance
185:12 - you know new kinds of windows that you
185:14 - didn't see before
185:18 - and also we have
185:21 - furniture
185:22 - furniture there we go furniture system
185:24 - or furniture so let me jump to furniture
185:28 - let me see what kind of tables it has so
185:30 - once i click on one i can see the
185:34 - uh a preview of it so round rectangular
185:37 - um still not that great
185:41 - but a bit a little bit better than what
185:43 - we had before
185:45 - so for instance this round table i'll
185:47 - hit open
185:50 - and nothing happens
185:52 - oh never mind it all immediately loads
185:55 - it in and now i can place it right
185:57 - so
185:58 - once i've pasted it and let me escape
186:01 - out of out of everything
186:03 - and even delete this this
186:06 - table altogether if now i go to
186:08 - components tab i can see that now this
186:11 - table with all of this variations
186:15 - is
186:16 - loaded in to the project right so now i
186:19 - can use it anytime i want right just
186:22 - choose it and place it
186:24 - okay so just i mean on your own time you
186:27 - can
186:28 - investigate what kind of stuff there is
186:30 - and what kind of families you can load
186:32 - in but it's mostly tables beds
186:35 - um
186:36 - [Music]
186:37 - right different kinds of beds
186:41 - seating
186:43 - right different kinds of chairs
186:45 - even carbs just here
186:50 - right that
186:53 - and then if we
186:55 - take a closer look to to all of the
186:57 - folders in the library
186:59 - we can see that there's even curtain
187:02 - wall panels different types of curtain
187:03 - wall panels different types of columns
187:06 - [Music]
187:07 - different types of
187:09 - different stuff
187:12 - so
187:13 - one thing that i'm interested in is
187:16 - windows for instance because before we
187:18 - had to
187:19 - work with pretty
187:21 - default you know pretty regular windows
187:24 - so if i
187:25 - escape out
187:27 - if i have let's say
187:29 - let me look at the 3d model
187:31 - where could i add a window by the way
187:34 - this is
187:35 - this is complete
187:36 - garbage you can't access this area right
187:40 - here so my staircase is completely like
187:43 - nonsense uh it's it's it's a bad
187:47 - staircase
187:48 - i should probably fix it
187:51 - yeah for pedagogical purposes i will be
187:53 - fixing the staircase sorry i can't can't
187:55 - have that in the tutorial so that's uh
187:58 - my first floor
188:00 - let me jump in there
188:02 - uh this staircase blocks off entrance to
188:05 - the
188:07 - to the balcony so i'll just delete it
188:10 - and instead let me just quickly
188:14 - stare
188:15 - there we go
188:16 - let me just from here to here four steps
188:20 - that's perfect and then from here
188:23 - to here all remaining steps
188:25 - that's uh can't make stairs that's cool
188:29 - uh let me try again escape or not escape
188:32 - just create a landing
188:34 - um let's say from here
188:37 - to here
188:39 - there we go now it's fine
188:41 - um i'll hit accept
188:44 - i'll probably change the oh no it is a
188:47 - monolithic run but it does have the
188:50 - um
188:51 - much more call it the the the railing
188:55 - so let me jump to a 3d view
189:00 - get rid of the railing that it's not in
189:03 - the way
189:04 - um i would need to fix a bunch of stuff
189:07 - here but that that is okay
189:10 - um
189:12 - or maybe we keep the railing well
189:15 - either way first floor
189:17 - there's enough of a gap for here to to
189:20 - walk through that's fine and now we have
189:22 - a gap here to actually access the
189:25 - balcony
189:28 - i believe in the second floor we need to
189:30 - yeah
189:31 - on the second floor we actually need
189:34 - um an opening here so uh to to access to
189:38 - be able to access the second floor now
189:40 - from the staircase so i will be
189:44 - either adding a new shaft opening or
189:47 - maybe in this case i will change i will
189:50 - delete the shaft opening altogether
189:53 - and i will change the
189:55 - the boundary of the floor slab here
189:59 - so to do that let in in 3d view let me
190:01 - just select the
190:03 - the floor slab oop
190:05 - this one the floor slab in question
190:07 - uh let me go to the first floor
190:10 - uh nope that's in the second floor there
190:12 - we go
190:13 - and let me click on edit boundary
190:16 - right here
190:19 - wait for it to
190:21 - figure it figure out what i want and
190:23 - here i will just draw a few lines so
190:28 - from here to here
190:32 - and i think up until here should be
190:35 - enough
190:37 - so that's going to be my opening which
190:39 - means that this line and this line
190:42 - like this line segment and this line
190:44 - segment shouldn't be there
190:45 - so i will be
190:47 - uh using
190:49 - either uh
190:51 - no wait pick walls is bad
190:55 - just a second oh there we go i will be
190:57 - using trim extend to corner uh tool
191:00 - right here
191:02 - so i'll select this line first and then
191:04 - this line
191:05 - so now they get
191:07 - like trimmed together
191:09 - and then this line and this line and
191:11 - also they get trimmed together i'll hit
191:14 - accept would you like walls to go i
191:16 - don't attach don't care
191:18 - now i have a proper opening in 3d view
191:21 - if i take a look at it and this is how
191:23 - it looks i think that's fine
191:26 - so now we can move up and we actually do
191:29 - have a
191:31 - possibility for an entrance which i am
191:32 - going to create
191:34 - so
191:35 - let's
191:37 - continue uh let's jump into
191:40 - second floor
191:42 - oh wait no sorry first floor let's jump
191:44 - into first floor and add the door here
191:47 - so to add the door you click on the door
191:49 - tool and actually
191:50 - why don't we find a different kind of a
191:53 - door i assume the library that we
191:55 - downloaded should contain different
191:58 - doors so load family
192:00 - go up from the tables from furniture and
192:04 - let's see
192:05 - dddd stands for doors
192:08 - doors there we go doors
192:11 - double click oh that's a lot of doors
192:15 - um
192:17 - curtain wall double glass door that's
192:19 - nice
192:21 - it's a simple one
192:23 - single panel door commercial doors
192:28 - and nothing too
192:29 - too nice here maybe we can just do
192:32 - curtain wall single glass
192:34 - you know regular doorway
192:37 - only that is in glass hit open
192:40 - it gets loaded in some of all of the
192:42 - families cannot be loaded
192:52 - what
192:57 - that's weird i am in the doors
193:00 - doors family
193:06 - okay you must choose family files of the
193:09 - category doors do you want to re retry
193:12 - loading a new set of oh right okay
193:16 - so this is
193:18 - this is important
193:19 - this is important so notice how the name
193:22 - says m
193:24 - door curtain wall single glass curtain
193:27 - wall is the key thing here so that means
193:29 - that this door belongs to a system of a
193:32 - curtain wall rather than
193:34 - a door system um remember back in
193:38 - the previous tutorial i did a curtain
193:40 - wall
193:40 - so this is a way of how you can add a
193:43 - door into the curtain wall so this
193:46 - family
193:47 - uh doesn't doesn't work so instead we
193:49 - need
193:50 - [Music]
193:51 - like a regular door
193:53 - like that
193:54 - um let's just find one that's
193:59 - good enough
194:00 - so all of these are curtain wall doors
194:04 - right
194:05 - um
194:08 - double
194:09 - no no
194:13 - i shouldn't be picky
194:19 - yeah sure panel would yeah whatever i'll
194:22 - just use that one
194:23 - it's it's not the prettiest but it will
194:25 - do i'll hit open
194:27 - now it it actually works i hit ok
194:34 - sure save the project whatever
194:37 - and now i'm able to add that particular
194:40 - door and it even has different
194:43 - types here
194:45 - for me to choose from right
194:47 - so i'll choose the
194:50 - let's say 2.1 meters by 80 centimeters
194:54 - something like that
194:55 - opens up outwards
194:58 - like that
195:00 - that's it
195:01 - so we have our door uh
195:04 - inserted right if i take a look at it in
195:08 - 3d
195:10 - that's not the door that i want
195:14 - so i will just simply select it
195:16 - scroll down here
195:19 - oh and and just choose the
195:21 - interior single
195:23 - four panel wooden door type right so i
195:26 - just switched the door type
195:28 - so now we're gucci
195:30 - um let's jump to first floor and add the
195:34 - window just like we added the door and
195:35 - let's add a super ugly window so let me
195:39 - go to the window tool load family
195:43 - jump back
195:45 - find windows there we go and let me just
195:49 - find a weird one
195:52 - oh my god this is a no
195:56 - um let's just find a regular one so it's
196:00 - it's the types of windows just like
196:02 - doors it's not like you can add any type
196:05 - of window to any type of geometry
196:08 - uh you will need to
196:10 - fiddle a little bit with it until you
196:13 - you become
196:14 - comfortable i will add
196:18 - oh perfect yeah that that's excellent
196:22 - that's
196:23 - that's exactly the window that i wanted
196:24 - to add i'll hit open
196:27 - it's going to load it in and now i can
196:30 - just add it i'll just add it in here
196:34 - bam
196:35 - like that
196:37 - let me check it in 3d view that's
196:41 - that's how it looks like
196:43 - i believe i will change the sill height
196:45 - to a little bit higher
196:48 - to to be a little bit higher so i'll
196:51 - just change it to 1 meter 200
196:54 - millimeters
196:55 - yeah
196:58 - yeah sounds about right or rather looks
197:01 - about right
197:03 - horrible anyway so that's how you add uh
197:07 - custom custom stuff to your your
197:10 - geometries uh last thing that i'm going
197:13 - to do since this is a gallery i should
197:15 - probably add wind
197:18 - not windows i should probably add like
197:20 - paintings and stuff uh so
197:23 - i will
197:25 - family
197:26 - load in family
197:29 - and where could i find paintings
197:32 - plumbing profiles railings
197:35 - furniture probably furniture right
197:42 - yeah probably furniture so furniture
197:46 - that's mirror
197:48 - beds storage tables
197:51 - there's no painting here huh
197:55 - oh my god so it's going to take me a
197:57 - while to
197:58 - to find it
198:01 - but we can find
198:02 - we can use a cabinet
198:06 - like shelving and place it there at
198:09 - least so i'll do that instead
198:12 - i know for a fact that there are
198:14 - paintings here uh in in this library
198:17 - it's just that finding them
198:19 - you know since i don't do it that often
198:21 - i don't remember where they are so
198:24 - instead i'll add a shelf there
198:26 - um i really hope that i can change the
198:28 - width of the shelf we will see
198:30 - um i'll hit open
198:34 - and probably need to do that in the
198:37 - ground floor right
198:39 - yeah
198:41 - like that and i will add i'll be adding
198:44 - a shelf right here
198:47 - so first let me
198:49 - place it
198:51 - escape
198:53 - there we go so now it's placed and let's
198:55 - see if we can edit type and
198:58 - yeah super so we can edit the
199:01 - [Music]
199:03 - the the shelf width and height and so on
199:06 - that that's that's great that's what we
199:08 - want
199:09 - um so let's make it proper
199:12 - i will
199:13 - grab the 3d view
199:15 - like that and i will dock it to the side
199:20 - like that
199:22 - perfect just so that i can constantly
199:24 - see
199:25 - you know
199:26 - the the shelf itself and there's my
199:28 - shelf
199:30 - just standing there
199:33 - so what i want to do is i want to make a
199:36 - different kind of section so let me move
199:38 - this
199:40 - section plane right here
199:42 - and instead let me move this section
199:45 - plane inwards even more
199:50 - uh maybe that's a little bit too much
199:53 - a little bit out oops that's the wrong
199:55 - one
199:57 - bam
199:58 - okay that's good so now we see our
200:02 - shelf
200:03 - just
200:04 - standing there
200:05 - i will align it
200:07 - so i will select it
200:09 - click on the align tool
200:11 - from
200:12 - to this edge from this edge
200:15 - just line it like that and we have our
200:18 - shelf
200:19 - i'll click on modify
200:21 - select it
200:23 - and now we can actually add a type and
200:25 - let's just hope that it it works right
200:29 - so depth
200:30 - of the shelf
200:32 - uh let's say
200:34 - 500 millimeters
200:39 - let apply
200:40 - okay that that works i will move it to
200:43 - to the correct position
200:45 - just in a second
200:46 - height so i know that the height between
200:49 - the floors the the
200:51 - the ground floor is 3.5 meters minus
200:55 - the floor slab so it's actually
200:58 - two eight five zero millimeters that's
201:02 - the height of the shelf it apply
201:06 - there we go that's good that's good
201:08 - and for width
201:10 - let's do a three meter shelf
201:13 - apply
201:17 - maybe that's a bit too much let's do a
201:19 - two meter shelf
201:22 - yeah that's that's good enough
201:24 - uh and then i will just simply
201:26 - reposition it
201:29 - and snap it in place and now i have a
201:31 - shelf here
201:33 - right
201:34 - to put some stuff in
201:36 - um right so that's how you add furniture
201:40 - uh pretty pretty simple
201:43 - now once once you've done that
201:46 - once you've added uh
201:49 - added furniture added all of the cool
201:52 - stuff that you want to have in your in
201:54 - your building
201:55 - it's
201:56 - around time that we actually start
202:01 - working with the graphics and extracting
202:03 - nice graphics from your 3d model right
202:09 - so how do we how do we go about it well
202:12 - first of all i want to
202:15 - i want to make sure that every view that
202:17 - i have
202:19 - actually has a proper
202:22 - um
202:26 - proper depth if that makes sense so i
202:29 - will be going through actually now i
202:30 - don't need 3d view anymore uh i will be
202:33 - going through every gra every floor and
202:36 - just checking if the depth is proper
202:39 - so here that seems fine
202:42 - that's our ground floor
202:44 - first floor
202:48 - we see the balcony
202:51 - and that seems fine second floor
202:54 - seems okay
202:56 - third floor
202:57 - wait second floor
203:02 - should see the balcony here right on on
203:04 - the on the second floor and we don't so
203:07 - if if that happens
203:09 - uh what you do is without having
203:11 - anything selected you go here on the
203:14 - left hand side and you find
203:17 - view range
203:19 - option
203:20 - view range and you click on edit
203:24 - that view range
203:26 - and here you will you will have this
203:29 - pop-up where you can change
203:32 - uh
203:33 - how deep do you see from that particular
203:36 - floor
203:37 - and it's also at what height do you cut
203:40 - but i don't change that
203:42 - uh so level i will just say i want to
203:45 - see all the way down to ground floor
203:48 - hit apply
203:50 - hit okay and now we see the balcony
203:53 - same thing for the third floor
203:56 - um where is it
204:01 - view range
204:03 - up to the ground floor apply
204:05 - okay
204:07 - there we go
204:08 - fourth floor
204:12 - floor actually does have
204:14 - oh wait we don't need four floor fourth
204:16 - floor is going to be our roof uh so we
204:20 - don't care about the fourth floor
204:23 - all right so we have
204:25 - all of the views done
204:26 - uh
204:27 - like that that we need and now it's all
204:30 - about filling in right all about making
204:33 - hatches creating hatches and
204:37 - one thing that i would probably do
204:40 - before
204:42 - before making it pretty or making it
204:44 - nicer i guess
204:47 - i will go to sheets
204:49 - here
204:51 - remember in rhino you have layouts so
204:53 - here layouts are called sheets and i
204:56 - will create
204:58 - create a sheet
204:59 - for every
205:01 - view that i'm going to have
205:03 - so i will right click
205:05 - on the sheets
205:07 - and choose new sheet
205:10 - click there and you can see that it asks
205:13 - me for a title block and by default it's
205:16 - set to a1 metric and no we will be using
205:21 - a3 and we don't have one right but
205:24 - you're in luck because i have created
205:26 - one for you to use so
205:29 - on the course website
205:32 - uh lth digitalwordpress.com
205:37 - 15
205:37 - [Music]
205:39 - scroll scroll scroll scroll
205:41 - you can download layout sheet template
205:43 - in revit family format
205:46 - this one right here or if this one
205:48 - doesn't work for you then you will be
205:50 - able to download the old version where
205:53 - you will need to change the
205:55 - the title but that's
205:56 - easy
205:58 - an easy fix
205:59 - so you download this one
206:03 - just download
206:07 - there we go
206:09 - have it here
206:12 - paste it here oh i already have had it
206:15 - here
206:16 - um and i will
206:20 - now load it in once it's downloaded i'll
206:22 - click on load i'll go to desktop
206:26 - and i have my aada15 sheet here hit open
206:31 - hit okay
206:33 - there it is right so now if i expand it
206:36 - i can see that it's a0101
206:39 - unnamed
206:40 - sheet that's fine we will be naming them
206:43 - in just a second
206:47 - so how do you get
206:49 - a drawing
206:51 - into
206:52 - the
206:53 - sheet
206:54 - well you do that by
206:57 - just
206:58 - for instance ground floor by just
206:59 - clicking and dragging in the drawing
207:02 - into the sheet
207:03 - click drag
207:05 - bam
207:07 - uh
207:08 - where is it oh yeah
207:11 - it's going to ask you for position click
207:13 - again
207:15 - there it is
207:17 - now it's inside of the sheet
207:22 - good enough
207:23 - good enough for now
207:26 - um i wonder if we can
207:29 - get rid of the
207:32 - ground floor title block
207:34 - i'll need to investigate
207:36 - so
207:37 - [Music]
207:40 - here in in in this particular view
207:43 - you are able to
207:45 - kind of either crop
207:47 - the view or
207:49 - uh change the visuals of this particular
207:53 - view uh i know that that's a not a
207:56 - tongue twister but
207:58 - just
207:58 - my brain is slow today
208:01 - basically you can adjust the graphics of
208:04 - this particular drawing in
208:06 - just to be in this sheet
208:10 - first things first
208:12 - since i have a title block i don't need
208:14 - this
208:15 - [Music]
208:16 - this title right here
208:18 - ground floor 1 to 100
208:21 - with numeration
208:23 - so i will select it
208:25 - and i will actually
208:27 - i believe it's in edit type right yes so
208:31 - once you select it you go to edit type
208:35 - right like right here and you untick
208:39 - show extension line
208:41 - and you
208:42 - where it says show title you
208:45 - say no
208:47 - and that should be yeah that should be
208:49 - that
208:50 - so now it's done hit okay
208:54 - you're good with that
208:56 - now for this particular
208:59 - view it's too big right it doesn't fit
209:02 - in your
209:03 - in your drawing so what do you do well
209:06 - here
209:07 - on once you have selected it on the
209:10 - [Music]
209:11 - left hand side
209:13 - you can find
209:14 - a tab called extends and a tick mark
209:18 - box called or check box called crop view
209:22 - if you
209:24 - select crop view and also if you select
209:27 - crop region visible
209:29 - you'll be able to
209:31 - [Music]
209:33 - to crop
209:34 - to crop the view
209:36 - yeah for the lack of a better word so
209:40 - let's see how how that how that works i
209:43 - don't think you can crop the view in the
209:46 - sheet
209:47 - which which is
209:49 - which kind of sucks
209:50 - but once you have those two tick marks
209:52 - and you go back to your ground floor
209:54 - view
209:56 - this rectangle will appear and then here
209:59 - in your ground floor plan
210:02 - you're able you you will be able to move
210:09 - this box
210:13 - that the sides of this box around until
210:17 - everything kind of fits nicely and then
210:20 - if you look at your sheet again
210:23 - this is how it looks
210:25 - right so i can see that i need to crop
210:28 - it even further so actually i'll just go
210:31 - to ground floor again and crop it even
210:34 - further
210:38 - perhaps there is a better way of doing
210:40 - it
210:41 - but
210:42 - i don't know uh i i always used this
210:45 - this method and it seems to work
210:49 - so yeah
210:50 - you end up with having this this kind of
210:52 - a view and this is 1 to 100 scale
210:56 - right uh this particular view is at the
211:00 - scale of one to a hundred how do i know
211:02 - well when i select the view
211:05 - and i scroll up here i can see view
211:07 - scale is one to a hundred if i change
211:10 - this to one to five hundred hit apply
211:14 - uh it's right here right so that's now
211:17 - one to five hundred you can see that the
211:19 - axes
211:20 - don't scale
211:22 - uh which is
211:24 - it's natural it they don't they
211:26 - shouldn't scale
211:28 - uh with the view
211:31 - there we go so we have our
211:34 - ground floor plan placed in inside of a
211:36 - sheet that's great and now there's
211:39 - just a few more things to fix here
211:42 - before we move on to our other plans
211:45 - so
211:47 - drawing name
211:49 - i wonder why is this not
211:54 - okay so
211:55 - how do you change things here drawing
211:58 - scale of course you don't need to change
211:59 - it's already kind of reading what kind
212:02 - of a
212:03 - scale you were working in
212:05 - but for instance drawing name and
212:08 - author's information you do need to
212:10 - insert right so for drawing name i will
212:13 - just click once
212:14 - and click once more it's not a double
212:17 - click if you double click it it's bad
212:20 - so it's click and then click again
212:23 - um
212:24 - and i'll just say
212:26 - ground
212:27 - floor
212:28 - plan
212:30 - plus 0.000
212:33 - right
212:36 - it should be plus minus but i don't care
212:38 - um and then for
212:42 - uh
212:42 - for the
212:44 - for my own name it's just
212:48 - there we go my own name
212:51 - um that's it right
212:53 - and you can see that the sheets
212:55 - automatically update the name here
212:58 - pops up ground floor plan plus
213:01 - 0.000 altitude okay so now we need to
213:05 - repeat this
213:07 - for every
213:08 - floor for every section and for every
213:11 - elevation and the 3d view as well
213:14 - um
213:15 - i will do this
213:18 - a few more times
213:20 - and i will do this faster just
213:23 - so that you can kind of
213:27 - see the process a few more times and
213:29 - then kind of
213:31 - hopefully it will help you troubleshoot
213:34 - so
213:35 - let's begin so i'll create a new sheet
213:38 - uh it's already present here since i
213:40 - loaded it in
213:42 - like that i will drag in first floor
213:45 - bam like that i will position it
213:48 - like that i will go to my first floor
213:51 - and here i'll scroll down
213:54 - check mark crop view crop region visible
213:57 - i'll crop it to
213:59 - barely fit
214:04 - like that
214:07 - great
214:08 - so that's now cropped
214:10 - i'll jump back to my
214:12 - sheet that's going to fit properly i'll
214:16 - just position it
214:18 - drawing name i will change the drawing
214:20 - name to first
214:22 - floor
214:23 - plan
214:24 - plus
214:26 - 3.5000 or five zero zero
214:29 - um my name is there it remembers that's
214:33 - good yeah that's done
214:35 - all right
214:36 - then let's do one for a section and one
214:40 - for elevation and one for 3d
214:43 - so i will
214:45 - create so that's going to be for section
214:47 - new sheet that's going to be for
214:49 - elevation
214:51 - new sheet that's going to be for 3d
214:54 - all right so let me grab um
214:57 - i don't care which section section one
214:59 - sure
215:00 - i'll just grab section one here
215:02 - place it
215:03 - uh that's fine
215:05 - i'll grab
215:09 - for for this sheet i will grab elevation
215:13 - uh let's go for street elevation
215:16 - edit
215:18 - bam
215:19 - that's done
215:21 - and for this sheet i will grab the 3d
215:24 - view
215:25 - wait uh
215:26 - no that's the section
215:28 - that's the elevation okay sure this one
215:30 - is going to be the 3d view
215:33 - bam
215:35 - click
215:37 - okay so there's a bunch of stuff that
215:39 - i'll need to fix in all three of them so
215:42 - first off um elevation
215:46 - there's uh you
215:48 - [Laughter]
215:50 - you you uh
215:52 - quite quite a few
215:54 - uh quite a few
215:56 - ugly bits but
215:58 - i think we will manage
216:02 - so let me first position it
216:04 - something like that seems to be okay let
216:07 - me check the street elevation
216:10 - um i will just actually drag this uh to
216:13 - be wider so our street elevation already
216:16 - has this uh all of this incorporated
216:20 - that this cropping box which is super
216:22 - great
216:24 - um and let me just drag these out
216:29 - i can't drag them more huh
216:31 - so they get locked for some reason
216:33 - that's fine
216:35 - um
216:37 - and let me oh my god come on just just
216:40 - let me
216:42 - i just want to select there we go okay
216:46 - i managed to select the the last
216:53 - mark
216:56 - and for some reason other
216:58 - marks
216:59 - just disappeared i don't know why
217:03 - that's super weird it shouldn't happen
217:06 - so we try it again
217:10 - yay
217:12 - can we unlock this
217:18 - so
217:19 - this lock means that
217:22 - oh understood okay so
217:25 - these locks mean that if i move
217:30 - uh for instance this
217:33 - um single sheet here
217:36 - see how all others move
217:39 - that's because they are locked together
217:42 - right so that that's what this lock
217:44 - means it's actually a pretty useful
217:46 - thing so
217:48 - the reason why the those disappeared was
217:51 - because once i select this
217:54 - zoomed into too close now it's
217:56 - calculating
217:59 - if i select this
218:00 - bottom markup
218:02 - i can see that it's locked
218:05 - with the dashed line i can see that it's
218:07 - actually locked to
218:09 - the ends of all other floors and i don't
218:12 - want that so what i'm going to do is
218:15 - actually instead of unlocking it i will
218:17 - tick mark here
218:19 - to have it on both sides i will tick
218:21 - mark untick here
218:24 - you barely can see it it's it's right
218:26 - here that that rectangle i will untick
218:29 - here to to hide that side and now i will
218:33 - indeed move
218:35 - the side out so that it fits
218:38 - properly here once everything is aligned
218:40 - i believe all of them get locked
218:42 - together
218:44 - which is absolutely fine this one is a
218:46 - little bit out of bounds so let me just
218:48 - move it back in
218:51 - so this is how it looks
218:53 - let me check check it in 3d not in 3d in
218:58 - the sheet
218:59 - it seems to be fitting quite properly
219:02 - the section plane the section line is a
219:05 - little bit out of bounds so let me fix
219:08 - that
219:08 - street elevation
219:10 - you
219:11 - are
219:14 - way too close
219:16 - or way too far
219:18 - be here
219:19 - and also i don't want this line running
219:22 - through the middle of my drawing so i'll
219:24 - just move it
219:26 - like so
219:28 - like that
219:30 - and like that perfect okay so that is
219:33 - done and maybe even i will get the
219:36 - cropping rectangle and i'll move it
219:40 - slightly in
219:41 - like that
219:43 - just to clean it up a bit
219:46 - um
219:47 - yeah let's see let's see let's see
219:50 - how it looks this is how it looks i
219:52 - think that's okay
219:55 - not great not terrible just okay
219:59 - um but
220:00 - i think this is this is something that
220:02 - we can continue on working with
220:05 - so that's our facade um let me rename
220:08 - this
220:11 - street
220:12 - assad
220:15 - yep
220:17 - let me jump into this section and
220:19 - actually immediately i'll rename this
220:21 - section to
220:23 - section aaa
220:28 - like that
220:30 - notice how the section is uh
220:32 - filled in uh while the all other
220:35 - drawings are not that's because if i
220:37 - take a look at the section um and i
220:39 - believe it's section one right
220:41 - it is filled in here and
220:44 - this is just
220:46 - the graphics settings right so i can
220:48 - change this to hidden line and now it's
220:50 - not filled in and if i now take a look
220:52 - at it in the
220:55 - [Music]
220:57 - sheet i keep wanting to say uh
221:01 - i now forgot the other one i keep
221:03 - wanting to see layout
221:05 - rather than sheet
221:07 - um
221:09 - now it's not filled right so it's it's
221:11 - graphic settings that you want to change
221:13 - if if there's a fill and you don't want
221:15 - to see a fill
221:18 - so that's our section
221:19 - nothing
221:20 - very fancy happening here and it's
221:22 - actually pretty damn close to being
221:25 - fine
221:26 - let me see if i can add more stuff if i
221:30 - can see more stuff within this section
221:34 - okay so there's the surrounding building
221:35 - right there
221:38 - and can i see the one on the other side
221:41 - of the street yes i can so i will just
221:43 - do something like this just to get
221:46 - the section of the street and the the
221:49 - section of the next door building
221:52 - um
221:53 - jump back to section aa this is how it
221:55 - looks
221:57 - almost fits
221:59 - i say i'd say i'd say almost fits
222:05 - um
222:06 - do we just do it like that
222:11 - ah come on
222:13 - by the way you can use arrow keys to
222:15 - kind of move it around
222:17 - so yeah okay good it fits
222:20 - the dashed lines go out of bounds but we
222:23 - don't care about those dashed lines so
222:24 - that's fine and the section line as
222:27 - always is super obnoxious and i will be
222:30 - fixing it
222:33 - map
222:35 - and
222:36 - just move that one in here
222:39 - uh until here
222:41 - clipping plane
222:44 - up
222:45 - like that
222:46 - flipping plane come on come on just give
222:49 - me give me give me like that there we go
222:53 - okay so that is done that's our section
222:56 - a a uh for now
222:58 - and then the last one is the 3d view
223:00 - which we will kind of revisit in just a
223:02 - second right now it's still well
223:05 - actually let's let's uh let's let's make
223:07 - it nice
223:08 - so that's in 3d
223:10 - i will just
223:12 - move my clipping box here
223:14 - [Music]
223:17 - that's fine
223:22 - i think that's something like that is
223:23 - kind of kind of neat
223:27 - let's see if we can add some more
223:29 - bizarres here
223:33 - that's nice
223:42 - i think that that that looks okay
223:44 - um let's
223:46 - see uh is it possible for me to hide
223:49 - this in this view i believe it is if i
223:52 - delete it yeah it's going to
223:55 - um to delete the floor plans as well
223:59 - which i don't want to do at all so
224:02 - instead i will figure out a way of how
224:04 - to hide it
224:06 - which is i believe this button right
224:08 - here hide in view
224:11 - hide
224:13 - category or hide elements hide elements
224:16 - there we go let's see if it actually
224:19 - translates to our 3d sheet here it does
224:23 - okay great so let us hide a bunch of
224:27 - stuff in in this 3d view so that it's
224:30 - not
224:31 - obnoxious
224:32 - um
224:33 - with information so that all of that
224:37 - actually
224:39 - hide
224:40 - in view
224:42 - hide elements okay that's good can i
224:45 - hide this
224:47 - yes i can super okay
224:50 - so these are hidden
224:52 - the shadows are a bit funky but that
224:54 - that's okay
224:56 - this is how it looks uh let's take a
224:59 - look at it in 3d
225:01 - yeah sure not 3d sorry in the sheet
225:05 - bam
225:06 - that looks actually good that that looks
225:09 - fine
225:10 - i'll just place it here
225:12 - my graphics card is
225:14 - crying a bit but that's
225:16 - that's normal
225:19 - um
225:20 - and yeah let's just name it um
225:23 - 3d
225:25 - exonometric
225:26 - [Music]
225:29 - 3d axonometric uh drawing scale there is
225:32 - no scale for an axonometric drawing so
225:35 - of course it's going to be empty
225:38 - okay
225:39 - that is done right that is that is okay
225:42 - that's done we are ready to move forward
225:45 - and the next thing that we're going to
225:47 - do is drink some coffee
225:53 - delicious
225:54 - and jump to our ground floor plan
225:58 - the sheet of ground floor plan
226:00 - and we will change
226:02 - the
226:04 - display settings
226:06 - here for this sheet so
226:10 - for instance
226:11 - let's start with a simple super simple
226:13 - example
226:15 - i want
226:16 - the walls here
226:18 - to be filled in black right
226:22 - so how do i do that well the thing is
226:24 - that in
226:26 - revit
226:27 - everything
226:28 - that you do
226:30 - um every geometry belongs to a certain
226:33 - category as i mentioned before and all
226:36 - of that geometry is going to be
226:39 - it within that category category is
226:42 - going to be shown in a certain way
226:45 - once you just look at it and once you
226:47 - look at a cut of it right so how do you
226:50 - change it how do you change the the
226:52 - visuals
226:54 - well you go to the view tab
226:57 - here in the top
226:58 - and you choose visibility and graphics
227:01 - so these are visibility and graphics
227:02 - settings right for that particular view
227:06 - in this case this sheet right here
227:09 - visibility and graphics
227:11 - and here it's a pretty
227:16 - big
227:17 - table
227:18 - where you can change different different
227:21 - aspects of your
227:23 - of your graphics right so basically how
227:26 - do you show air terminals how do you
227:27 - show areas how do you show ceilings how
227:29 - do you show columns and and so on
227:32 - all of that is being treated by this
227:35 - table
227:36 - um
227:38 - one important
227:39 - one important note is that
227:42 - you have two
227:44 - big
227:46 - sides here not sides two big columns
227:49 - here one is projection surface this is
227:52 - where you just look at the element
227:56 - and the other one is cut
227:58 - which means how would it show you a
228:01 - section of that particular element so in
228:04 - case of
228:06 - maybe that's the fastest way to do it is
228:08 - just to show you with wall so i just
228:09 - scroll down to walls
228:12 - and i will say when i cut
228:15 - the walls
228:17 - the lines
228:19 - of the cut
228:21 - so i'll click on override here
228:24 - the lines of the cut
228:26 - should be solid
228:30 - should have red color
228:34 - and should be
228:36 - pretty damn thick
228:38 - maybe even thicker let's go for 16 who
228:40 - cares hit ok
228:43 - hit apply
228:45 - and nothing changes
228:49 - how come
228:53 - is it because i'm in the sheet
228:58 - sorry
228:59 - technical difficulties please please
229:01 - hold visibility on graphics
229:05 - walls
229:08 - solid red
229:12 - 16
229:13 - okay apply
229:15 - ah okay apparently you need to change it
229:18 - not in the sheet but rather in the
229:21 - um
229:22 - in the floor plan itself
229:25 - and then it should show up
229:32 - yeah then it's going to show up in the
229:34 - sheet so as you can see 16 is a little
229:36 - bit thick
229:37 - uh let's jump back and let's actually
229:40 - jump back to ground floor plan and
229:41 - actually change the the
229:44 - graphics here so i will click on
229:47 - visibility graphics and go back to walls
229:50 - and actually i do want my wall cut
229:54 - to be
229:56 - solid
229:58 - a solid line but it should be black
230:02 - and the weight should be
230:04 - less like five or something
230:07 - yeah that that seems good right
230:10 - so so we end up with these these this
230:12 - kind of cut and then for the pattern i
230:15 - will say overwrite
230:17 - and you you have the possibility to have
230:19 - two patterns but i would strongly
230:21 - suggest you not having two patterns you
230:23 - know one laid on top of the other
230:25 - foreground background instead just work
230:28 - with the background pattern
230:30 - for now
230:32 - so for pattern i will also see solid
230:34 - fill and i'll say
230:36 - yeah again black
230:39 - hit okay
230:40 - hit apply
230:44 - that's that's that right
230:46 - so what else can we change here in in
230:48 - the plan
230:49 - uh plan view well the surrounding
230:52 - buildings and the surrounding uh
230:55 - uh street and so on uh all of them are
230:58 - white and actually i wanted to kind of
231:04 - change not to change
231:06 - to
231:08 - differentiate between the inside
231:11 - of this building and everything else the
231:14 - outside so remember right at the start
231:17 - of the course we have imported
231:20 - the surrounding geometry the site
231:24 - 3d model as a generic model so now i
231:27 - will find
231:29 - this generic model type here
231:32 - generic models
231:34 - right here and
231:36 - i will say
231:38 - that when we cut the generic models
231:42 - it should still have a pretty thick
231:45 - solid line right so solid line black
231:48 - color
231:49 - weight
231:50 - again five
231:53 - oh yeah hit apply forgot so now it it
231:56 - kind of gives us a bolder line where it
231:59 - cuts
232:01 - and then for patterns
232:04 - uh for the cut pattern i will say
232:07 - it should be a solid fill
232:09 - but the color shouldn't be black because
232:11 - that's going to be way too dark rather
232:14 - let's just say
232:15 - yeah gray
232:17 - hit ok
232:19 - hit apply
232:21 - so now everything that is being cut
232:25 - outside of the building is going to have
232:27 - this kind of gray color
232:29 - what about
232:30 - everything that's outside of the
232:32 - building that's not being cut i want it
232:35 - to be
232:37 - light gray right so then i will go to
232:41 - the projection part of it
232:44 - and i'll find patterns
232:46 - generic models patterns
232:48 - and here i will say for background let's
232:51 - use a solid fill but let's use a super
232:55 - super light
232:57 - gray color hit ok
233:00 - ok
233:01 - apply
233:03 - there we go
233:05 - hit ok here
233:07 - so now we have this
233:09 - this graphics uh graphics settings done
233:12 - for this particular view if i look at it
233:15 - in my sheets i can see that it's it's
233:18 - there
233:18 - if i were to
233:20 - add more
233:24 - more walls here
233:29 - right
233:30 - [Music]
233:32 - they don't get filled in
233:33 - [Music]
233:34 - what oh my god come on
233:38 - come on rabbit
233:41 - is that because it's a basic wall no it
233:44 - shouldn't be right
233:46 - right
233:48 - that's super strange okay let's see why
233:51 - it's not
233:52 - it's not working
233:54 - uh let's go to view
233:57 - visibility and graphics
234:00 - this this really feels like a bug but
234:04 - maybe i'm wrong but
234:06 - i haven't seen this happen before
234:09 - at all
234:10 - but i guess it's it's nice to from time
234:13 - to time see
234:14 - i see these things happen so let me
234:16 - change the color to red
234:19 - apply
234:24 - it's thinking
234:26 - will it crack okay it doesn't crash but
234:28 - it's not filling it in
234:33 - okay we will need to revisit that part
234:36 - later and then figure out why the hell
234:38 - is that happening
234:40 - um if this happens just try closing and
234:43 - opening rhino again that's probably
234:45 - going to solve it oh
234:47 - i know
234:48 - [Music]
234:49 - i'm dumb
234:51 - um this wall
234:53 - right here this wall
234:55 - it
234:56 - its height is 1.1 meters
235:01 - which means it doesn't reach the section
235:04 - through which we cut which means we are
235:05 - actually not cutting through these walls
235:08 - but right
235:09 - [Music]
235:11 - cancel
235:12 - we're not cutting through these walls
235:14 - but rather we are just looking at the
235:16 - top of these walls right
235:18 - uh probably in the
235:21 - section one is going to be a little bit
235:23 - more clear no it's not in section two
235:26 - yeah there we go so in section two you
235:28 - can actually see these walls here
235:32 - all right so we are not cutting through
235:35 - them at that height
235:37 - this is why it's not
235:39 - filling in but if i select them and i
235:42 - change the unconnected height of them to
235:44 - let's see two meters
235:46 - hit apply
235:49 - now they're being cut
235:51 - okay so that was
235:55 - can't make a perfect tutorial
235:58 - um always something there's always
236:01 - something wrong
236:02 - okay
236:04 - that's done let's jump into first floor
236:07 - and see that oh crap first floor also
236:11 - requires us to do exactly the same thing
236:14 - as we did for the ground floor
236:16 - so then the question is
236:19 - is it possible to somehow save these
236:21 - settings
236:22 - these graphics settings and apply them
236:25 - to all other floors and yes the answer
236:28 - is of course yes the of course
236:30 - i will just go to visibility graphics
236:33 - right here
236:35 - and i
236:36 - will or wait no sorry sorry not
236:40 - visibility graphics cancel cancel that
236:42 - uh in ground floor i will go to view
236:44 - templates
236:46 - here
236:47 - and i will say create template from
236:49 - current view
236:52 - and i will name this
236:54 - kinda good
236:58 - floor
236:59 - plan
237:01 - style
237:03 - hit
237:04 - okay it's going to save it
237:07 - hit ok again and now in the first floor
237:10 - i can go to view templates again
237:13 - and choose apply template properties to
237:16 - current view
237:18 - and then i will find my kind of good
237:20 - floor plan style
237:23 - apply properties
237:25 - and hit ok and now my first floor also
237:28 - has the same
237:31 - view
237:32 - second floor
237:33 - view templates apply
237:35 - kind of good
237:37 - okay
237:39 - third floor three templates apply
237:42 - kind of good okay
237:45 - so that's done
237:46 - now the question is
237:49 - can we do this for a 3d view for
237:52 - instance no maybe not
237:54 - can we do this for
237:56 - section right because section is
237:58 - basically just a vertical plan right or
238:01 - a plan is a horizontal section whatever
238:03 - you want to call it so can we apply the
238:06 - same
238:07 - view
238:08 - template here if i go to view templates
238:10 - apply and i choose apply template
238:12 - properties from view
238:14 - you might not see
238:16 - uh the
238:18 - that our template here that's because uh
238:22 - there's a filter applied which only is
238:24 - looking for templates which are uh
238:28 - which work with sections elevations and
238:31 - whatnot
238:32 - so
238:33 - i will expand this and i will just say
238:35 - all
238:38 - and i'll then find my kind of good floor
238:41 - plan style
238:43 - hit apply
238:44 - hit okay
238:46 - still works but the problem with this
238:48 - one is that it's still i still need more
238:54 - to to to change more styles here because
238:56 - for instance floor slabs they are not
238:58 - being cut
239:02 - and also i kind of want to cut through
239:04 - the
239:06 - through the doorway so let me move that
239:08 - section as well so in the ground floor
239:10 - plan i will just take the section
239:13 - and i will move it
239:15 - so that it cuts
239:18 - there we go so that it cuts through the
239:20 - the staircase and also the doorway in
239:23 - the first floor
239:25 - let's look at section two
239:28 - no section one
239:30 - there we go
239:32 - so
239:32 - now we are cutting through the the stair
239:35 - which is not being hatched in properly
239:38 - and we are cutting through the
239:41 - the floor slabs which are not being
239:43 - hashed in properly uh if we had a roof
239:46 - that also wouldn't be hatched in
239:48 - properly so we need to fix a few things
239:50 - let me go to visibility and graphics
239:52 - settings
239:53 - find stairs
239:58 - stairs there we go
240:00 - cut line override
240:04 - solid line
240:05 - black color
240:08 - weight
240:09 - also five
240:10 - that seems to be working for us quite
240:12 - well
240:14 - for patterns override
240:16 - background
240:18 - solid fill
240:20 - black
240:22 - apply
240:24 - there we go our staircase is now black
240:26 - and
240:28 - floor slabs
240:30 - ffff floors not floor slabs just floors
240:36 - pattern is going to be black
240:40 - and solid
240:43 - and lines are going to be
240:45 - solid
240:46 - black
240:49 - weight five apply
240:52 - okay
240:54 - this is what we have right nothing too
240:56 - fancy but it does the trick
241:00 - okay so we have that going on
241:03 - and that's our section and if we take a
241:05 - look at our section in here or actually
241:08 - maybe we should
241:10 - fill in nah nah let's not
241:13 - uh so let's see where is our section
241:15 - section aa there we go
241:17 - here it is
241:18 - all
241:19 - all ready to be plotted out
241:22 - um
241:23 - facade
241:27 - actually i kind of like the style of the
241:28 - facade here
241:31 - i don't really want to change anything
241:33 - the only thing that i kind of want to do
241:35 - is add shadows
241:37 - to the facade so i will go to
241:41 - my
241:43 - street elevation
241:44 - right here and here in the bottom i will
241:48 - choose shadows to be turned on like that
241:52 - and maybe i'll click on the small sun
241:54 - icon send settings
241:56 - and i will just mess around with the sun
242:00 - so
242:02 - can i just do still
242:05 - still hit apply
242:08 - let me change the location to
242:15 - not boston
242:17 - not no not not boston
242:20 - definitely not boston
242:23 - um
242:27 - i think we have denmark there uh
242:28 - copenhagen at least
242:31 - will will you give me copenhagen or will
242:34 - you give me malmo
242:37 - yeah it doesn't give us malmo
242:40 - whatever let's lie if
242:43 - you can't find the city just lie we'll
242:46 - just choose lighting and here we will
242:48 - just change the altitude and azimuth so
242:55 - perhaps i want it to be a little bit
242:57 - lower so 30 degrees
243:00 - apply
243:01 - yeah that's that's a bit better and asim
243:04 - of
243:05 - 115
243:09 - so it eats up a little bit more
243:13 - yeah i think that's that's about it or
243:15 - maybe uh what if it's 45 degrees
243:18 - with that seam as a move so it does that
243:21 - this is hole in the shadow this is kinda
243:24 - doing his thing yeah i think that's fine
243:26 - i think that's fine
243:28 - that's okay
243:29 - and for the actual style
243:32 - i want the building my building to be
243:36 - kind of popping out a little bit more so
243:39 - i will push
243:41 - all surrounding buildings a little bit
243:43 - backwards
243:44 - with
243:45 - a
243:46 - gray color
243:47 - basically so visibility and graphics
243:52 - generic models
243:53 - patterns uh no that's a cut pattern we
243:56 - are not cutting anything
243:58 - so projection surface patterns
244:00 - color
244:03 - light gray
244:06 - solid fill
244:08 - apply
244:11 - there we go and maybe even
244:13 - generic models lines
244:16 - i will say solid line
244:20 - and
244:21 - kinda not not black but dark gray color
244:25 - with kind of low weight so
244:28 - weight of one
244:32 - so
244:33 - though the line work is a little bit uh
244:37 - thinner and a little bit more towards uh
244:40 - gray
244:40 - um even more gray please
244:44 - i know it doesn't really matter that
244:46 - much but i really wanna
244:50 - i'm gonna make it as nice as possible
244:54 - yeah that's great enough okay
244:57 - we have that done we have our building
245:01 - popping up popping out
245:03 - um and that is good
245:05 - so
245:06 - let me just double check street facade
245:08 - looks like that that looks like that axo
245:11 - actually i will not well maybe in the
245:13 - axle also visibility and graphics
245:17 - uh generic models lines
245:22 - solid
245:24 - gray
245:27 - thin line
245:28 - patterns up patterns
245:31 - uh pattern solid
245:36 - light gray
245:39 - okay
245:40 - apply okay
245:45 - yo
245:46 - did i mess mess up
245:50 - generic models parents
245:54 - it should work
246:01 - okay
246:01 - what about the cut what if i change the
246:04 - cut here solid fill
246:06 - [Music]
246:09 - solid fill color
246:11 - red
246:17 - okay so apparently oh
246:20 - that's my bad i i i can hear you
246:23 - screaming at the at the screen uh
246:26 - i am working in the sheet and not in the
246:29 - actual 3d view
246:31 - that's my bad as per usual oh my god
246:35 - so let's do it here
246:36 - [Laughter]
246:39 - generic models patterns
246:43 - light gray
246:46 - solid fill
246:48 - generic models pattern solid
246:51 - color dark
246:52 - gray weight very low
246:55 - apply
246:57 - perfect
246:59 - section could be
247:02 - no let's keep section as it is
247:04 - just hit ok
247:07 - right so that our our building kind of
247:09 - pops up a bit more
247:12 - okay
247:15 - we have that going on
247:17 - um
247:19 - right so that's about it that's about it
247:21 - in terms of our
247:24 - our graphics
247:27 - i think
247:28 - it's turning out to be okay
247:31 - students tend to ask me about the
247:35 - lines how to change the style of the
247:37 - grid lines because the style is pretty
247:40 - pretty obnoxious
247:42 - uh
247:43 - and the the way you do it is you
247:45 - download a nicer style and actually
247:48 - could we
247:52 - so to load in a section
247:56 - um a new section markup for instance you
247:59 - go to load family
248:02 - and here
248:04 - it's it's going to be under english
248:06 - annotations by the way if if you
248:09 - can't find the folder of the library
248:10 - let's say you're you're in the desktop
248:12 - uh it's located in this pc
248:16 - c disk drive
248:19 - program data which is a hidden folder if
248:22 - you don't know how to
248:26 - see all hidden folders you need to
248:28 - actually go to
248:30 - any folder that you have on your desktop
248:33 - or on your computer you go to view tab
248:36 - click on options you go to view tab
248:39 - again in the options and you choose show
248:42 - hidden files folders and drives hit
248:44 - apply hit ok and then you will see the
248:46 - program data folder
248:49 - and here you see autodesk
248:53 - uh
248:54 - rvt2021 libraries finally we are here
248:57 - they are really hiding it from us
249:00 - it's under english
249:02 - and i believe it should be under
249:04 - annotations right
249:08 - because where else could it be
249:11 - yeah it's
249:12 - yes it should be under annotations
249:16 - um grid level
249:19 - section section head there we go section
249:22 - head and here we see different types of
249:25 - section heads and all of them are
249:28 - complete garbage
249:31 - not garbage but uh really disgusting so
249:35 - it is what it is
249:37 - you're stuck with ugly section heads in
249:40 - in revit unless you download one from
249:43 - the internet that's that's nice
249:46 - um in terms of editing the section head
249:49 - itself
249:51 - zoomed in to close again
249:57 - [Music]
250:00 - in in in case of editing the section
250:02 - itself i believe um
250:05 - if you select it
250:07 - if you select it there we go
250:10 - you can change
250:16 - with that in the type
250:19 - cloud tag
250:28 - jesus christ that's a lot of
250:32 - you know what
250:35 - let's not dig too deep in into here
250:38 - just have a freaking section in there
250:41 - and
250:45 - yeah you just have a freaking section in
250:47 - there and then call it a day that's
250:49 - that's fine that you don't need to
250:53 - to have it too
250:56 - too intense
250:57 - um
251:00 - right what else is there to to show you
251:09 - oh that's it uh let's let's plot it out
251:12 - uh let's plot everything out so you have
251:15 - your sheets ready let's see
251:17 - i have a few of them yeah sure save the
251:20 - project always save the project by the
251:22 - way
251:23 - um i have a few ready here
251:26 - and it's time to
251:28 - print out or plot out your sheets into
251:31 - pdf so i'll go to file
251:34 - print
251:35 - or is it export
251:37 - no it's print
251:39 - file print
251:40 - print
251:41 - or just click on this print button here
251:43 - that's that works as well
251:46 - where here we have all of the different
251:50 - different settings uh that you can
251:52 - use for for plotting out the the sheets
251:56 - so first things first printer we will
251:59 - choose adobe pdf or
252:04 - microsoft print to pdf i think that one
252:06 - works as well
252:08 - anything that has the pdf word in it
252:11 - should work so adobe pdf for me
252:15 - kind combine multiple selected view
252:17 - sheets into a single file so do we want
252:19 - it in a single file yeah sure
252:23 - whatever
252:24 - print range
252:25 - uh we will not use current view
252:28 - instead we will use selected views
252:33 - selected views sheets and i will click
252:35 - on the select button
252:37 - and i will say i want to print out this
252:40 - this this this this these sheets right
252:43 - not the floor plans not the structural
252:45 - plans just the sheets
252:47 - i'll hit okay
252:49 - do you want to save these settings for
252:50 - use in the future revit session sure
252:53 - yeah sure
252:54 - so that's going to be my set one
252:57 - apparently
252:58 - my the name and the location of where
253:01 - i'm going to be exporting the pdf is uh
253:05 - weird so i'll just be exporting it to
253:07 - desktop so i'll just choose desktop hit
253:09 - save
253:10 - yeah perfect and the name of the file
253:13 - well right now it doesn't matter because
253:15 - i'm going to be messing around with it
253:17 - in photoshop so that's that's okay
253:20 - um
253:24 - right let's see these two buttons here
253:27 - properties as well as the setup so
253:29 - properties if i click on that
253:32 - i can see here
253:34 - nothing fancy nothing special paper
253:38 - source whatever layout
253:40 - landscape
253:42 - if i click on the advanced i can see
253:44 - that the paper size is said to be letter
253:47 - rather than a3
253:50 - that's a nice way of hiding it let me
253:52 - just see if
253:54 - okay
253:55 - so we don't need to go to properties
253:57 - here sorry about that you just go to
253:59 - settings setup
254:02 - and here we can actually change it from
254:07 - the the
254:08 - letter size to the proper a3 size
254:12 - so we are working these sheets are
254:15 - tailored for a3 its landscape format
254:19 - is going to be
254:21 - centered sure
254:23 - and the zoom is going to be 100 so it's
254:26 - not fit to page it's rather zoom
254:29 - 100
254:30 - uh vector processing sure raster quality
254:33 - high colors
254:35 - color
254:37 - oh yeah you can choose either color or
254:38 - grayscale we'll just use color that's
254:40 - fine
254:42 - um
254:43 - everything else is fine seems to be okay
254:45 - so i'll just hit ok and i'll hit ok
254:47 - again
254:49 - you have chosen to print five views as
254:51 - separate files
254:58 - do i want to yes i do want them as
255:00 - separate files because i'm going to
255:01 - photoshop them so i'll hit yes
255:04 - um
255:06 - right let me just create a new folder
255:08 - just so that it's easy for me to find
255:12 - raw
255:13 - pdf
255:14 - pdfs
255:16 - raw pdfs hit save
255:20 - it's doing its magic saving it while
255:22 - it's doing it i'll open up photoshop
255:23 - real fast
255:31 - [Music]
255:34 - by now you should be able to
255:36 - kind of
255:40 - wait just a second uh
255:42 - there revit
255:43 - save
255:44 - so you will need to click save for every
255:46 - sheet that's not a problem um by now you
255:49 - should be able to
255:51 - uh to to
255:53 - work with with pdfs uh
255:56 - in photoshop easily
255:59 - um that that's my expectation because we
256:01 - have been doing doing it for the past
256:07 - four
256:08 - courses now or three with three or four
256:11 - four
256:12 - past four courses
256:14 - no this is the fourth one right
256:17 - anyway we've been doing it quite quite a
256:19 - lot so you should be able to add
256:21 - textures and change colors and and
256:24 - whatnot in photoshop of your drawings
256:28 - hopefully
256:30 - don't show me this again close
256:32 - uh so that's that so i will just be
256:35 - really quick in showing you this last
256:37 - bit
256:39 - save that
256:43 - and i think that's that's the last of it
256:45 - right yes okay so let me save this file
256:50 - in photoshop i will just
256:53 - find my
256:55 - folder with all of the pdfs
256:58 - i'll just kind of drag all of them in
257:01 - and just choose what which which one i
257:03 - want to
257:04 - work with and show you
257:07 - show you how i'm going to work with it
257:09 - so crop 2
257:11 - not bounding box never bounding box
257:14 - media box
257:16 - you always when you import pdf you
257:18 - choose media box so that it doesn't mess
257:20 - up your a3 size
257:24 - other than that it seems fine
257:27 - okay
257:30 - uh media box yes that's good
257:33 - so it remembers at least it remembers
257:35 - that's good
257:37 - okay okay okay
257:39 - okay
257:41 - okay
257:42 - so we have our section we have our
257:45 - uh elevation we have our
257:48 - axo floor plan floor plan so floor plans
257:51 - are kind of boring i will just
257:53 - close them immediately
257:56 - won't photoshop anything there
257:58 - um i could work here maybe
258:02 - on this one
258:03 - [Music]
258:04 - i don't know i i like how clean it is
258:06 - let's work on the elevation instead
258:09 - so section also goes away sure
258:13 - let me just show you how i would work on
258:15 - it with uh on the elevation so
258:18 - let's say i want uh
258:19 - some sort of pattern here i i don't know
258:23 - some some form of pattern let's say
258:26 - metal or something like that i'll just
258:28 - go to the interwebs
258:31 - i'll go to google and i'll say
258:38 - what's a cool pattern metal
258:40 - metal sheet
258:42 - pattern
258:43 - [Music]
258:46 - corrugated steel or something like that
258:48 - um
258:51 - perforated diamond that's that's
258:53 - whatever
258:56 - are there any good ones
258:58 - licensable
259:01 - no
259:04 - yeah that's good enough right
259:06 - uh i will just open it in a new window i
259:09 - know it has the
259:12 - watermark
259:14 - this is for a tutorial so
259:17 - we don't care
259:20 - uh so i'll just position it
259:22 - i will
259:24 - cut away the part that i
259:27 - need
259:29 - copy paste
259:31 - um so there's one unnecessary layer that
259:33 - i delete
259:34 - um i will say
259:36 - do we multiply oops that's the wrong one
259:40 - that's the actual drawing do we multiply
259:43 - the
259:46 - the texture yeah we do we probably do
259:48 - but before we do that let me try to get
259:51 - rid of the
259:52 - watermark by
259:54 - going to levels and
259:57 - messing around with
260:02 - with the levels
260:04 - yeah that seems okay
260:06 - that seems good enough
260:07 - uh make it smaller
260:11 - like that that's perfect
260:13 - ctrl a ctrl c ctrl v to duplicate it
260:18 - maybe ctrl t right clicking and flip
260:20 - vertical to
260:22 - kind of have a
260:25 - much more call it
260:27 - uh
260:29 - a seamless connection between between
260:31 - the two textures i will just merge these
260:34 - two layers together merge layers
260:36 - place them here
260:39 - ctrl c ctrl v
260:41 - again
260:43 - [Music]
260:44 - merge the layers again
260:46 - ctrl a ctrl c ctrl v
260:49 - again
260:50 - but this one ctrl t and right click flip
260:53 - horizontal
260:54 - so that they did emerge more nicely
260:58 - merge layers
261:00 - now i will jump to multiply
261:05 - that seems okay maybe make it a bit
261:08 - smaller
261:10 - that seems fine
261:15 - maybe a bit bigger
261:17 - yeah that's sounds
261:19 - looks looks around right
261:22 - i can
261:23 - then select
261:27 - the area in which i want them
261:30 - uh ctrl
261:32 - shift i to invert the selection and then
261:35 - hit delete to get rid of everything else
261:38 - ctrl d to
261:40 - deselect
261:41 - and then just
261:43 - go to town and
261:45 - remove
261:47 - remove
261:48 - that delete
261:52 - remove that
261:55 - delete
261:58 - that gets removed
262:01 - lit
262:04 - also that
262:06 - uh what else there we go that's the the
262:09 - doorway here
262:12 - that gets removed
262:15 - and that gets removed
262:17 - so also
262:19 - also i want a
262:22 - a little bit of a gradient here
262:26 - right here
262:27 - just to show that this is like a better
262:30 - show that this is a cantilever so i'll
262:32 - just
262:33 - mark out where i want the gradient to be
262:36 - that goes from black to white i'll
262:38 - create a new layer just
262:40 - drag out the gradient there
262:42 - like this
262:44 - i'll say
262:46 - 21 something like this and it kind of
262:50 - you know this is without the gradient
262:51 - this is with so it just gives a little
262:53 - bit of a of a shadow there
262:56 - um right so we have a little bit of the
262:59 - corrugated steel it's not great by any
263:02 - stretch of imagination
263:04 - but it does the trick
263:07 - and i think what we can do is we can
263:10 - find
263:13 - some sort of a
263:16 - colored texture so
263:18 - cortan
263:20 - steel
263:23 - corten steel texture
263:28 - um
263:30 - yeah sure let's let's use this one
263:33 - uh
263:35 - open image
263:36 - oh that's that's a
263:39 - pretty low resolution but we don't care
263:41 - ctrl v
263:43 - paste it here
263:45 - i'll actually split it into parts
263:49 - ctrl x ctrl v
263:51 - place it here
263:53 - [Music]
263:55 - this one
263:57 - control x control up
263:59 - in this layer ctrl x ctrl v
264:02 - [Music]
264:05 - i don't know what i did but that's that
264:07 - that works as well
264:10 - like that
264:12 - perhaps
264:14 - [Music]
264:17 - that's good enough
264:18 - and then
264:21 - actually can we just do that yeah we can
264:24 - just do that
264:26 - no one will ever know
264:28 - um so this and
264:31 - the bottom one i will just add
264:35 - uh are you the bottom one no are you the
264:37 - bottom one yes
264:38 - ctrl c ctrl v
264:41 - just add it there
264:43 - okay so let me merge all of these
264:44 - together
264:46 - merge layers
264:49 - ctrl t to transform them a little bit
264:52 - more so that they're a little bit bigger
264:55 - um let's say multiply right
264:58 - so i think multiply will work and we
265:00 - already did some cutting
265:02 - so i'll just use the magic wand tool
265:05 - with certain tolerance and just select
265:09 - the cutouts
265:11 - like that
265:12 - ctrl shift i to invert
265:16 - delete nope
265:19 - uh ctrl shift i delete there we go okay
265:23 - so we deleted and we are kind of
265:26 - good to go with the with the carton
265:28 - steel let's make it a little bit less
265:31 - intense
265:35 - something like that i think that that
265:37 - that that's fine
265:39 - um and then for the windows
265:41 - i'll actually use the
265:43 - [Music]
265:46 - the magic wand tool to select the glass
265:51 - bam
265:52 - [Music]
265:53 - bam
265:54 - come on
265:56 - ah yay
266:00 - almost there there we go is that glass i
266:04 - i think that's glass at least and that
266:07 - is definitely glass okay
266:09 - uh so we have those done and i will just
266:13 - say
266:18 - let's do
266:23 - let's do control
266:29 - do we just use gradients rather
266:34 - maybe
266:36 - like that and then we switch the
266:38 - gradient to white and just give it
266:42 - like this kind of a kind of a tug here
266:46 - or maybe not
266:47 - perfect white um
266:52 - a little bit of of gray
266:54 - look like that look like that uh
266:59 - that that looks okay of course re reduce
267:03 - the
267:04 - the intensity of it
267:07 - the opacity of it
267:09 - something like this
267:10 - um and i think if we just kind of
267:13 - casually now select everything that's
267:17 - remaining
267:18 - and just
267:21 - edit
267:22 - fill
267:23 - shift five
267:25 - foreground color hit okay
267:27 - [Music]
267:29 - in a new fold
267:31 - in a new layer
267:33 - so that's shift f5 okay
267:35 - [Music]
267:36 - and we just move it below
267:40 - the whole thing
267:41 - [Music]
267:44 - why is that
267:46 - oh
267:46 - that's my bed
267:49 - so you can't do that this way huh
267:55 - uh
267:58 - i wanna
268:00 - i want to
268:02 - color the frames
268:03 - so how do we color the frames this is
268:05 - going to be uh
268:07 - now it's turning out to be a photoshop
268:09 - tutorial i want to color the frames but
268:11 - i don't want to select them
268:12 - individually so what i'm going to do is
268:17 - i will say
268:19 - okay
268:20 - first of all can we just do that
268:24 - not really oh or maybe we can control d
268:27 - um maybe we can if i go to curtain steel
268:32 - layer
268:34 - and i just select all of this
268:37 - right
268:39 - so i selected all of this
268:42 - and then
268:44 - we
268:47 - go to
268:48 - the window layer and we
268:51 - unselect holding down the alt key was it
268:54 - the alt key was it control
268:57 - i don't remember
268:58 - control shift no alt shift
269:02 - no uh how what's the shortcut for the
269:06 - subtract from selection
269:08 - it should be ctrl
269:10 - right no it should be shift no it should
269:13 - be
269:14 - hold
269:14 - there we go so it is the old key
269:17 - i don't know why why that
269:19 - didn't work out
269:21 - and tolerance needs to be like a hundred
269:24 - for this to work
269:27 - uh it doesn't really work that well
269:31 - maybe
269:32 - seems to be working okay
269:34 - now
269:36 - so we have that we are unselecting that
269:39 - oh
269:43 - messed up
269:46 - ah
269:47 - do i really need to do it again
269:54 - i know
269:55 - i i i figured it out
269:58 - this this this and that
270:01 - and this right we select this bear with
270:04 - me be patient or skip ahead
270:07 - you have the possibility to skip ahead
270:09 - um so i select inside of the windows and
270:14 - then i turn on the drawing
270:17 - and unselect
270:21 - the glass but why didn't it oh yeah
270:24 - that's because i need to be in the
270:26 - drawing layer and then i can unselect
270:29 - the glass panes
270:31 - planes paints
270:34 - glass
270:35 - glass thingies
270:38 - and it's a mess here but that's fine
270:41 - so i am unselecting and now i'm i'm
270:44 - selecting the shadowy bits as well
270:47 - with less tolerance maybe 32 i like
270:50 - tolerance of 32. it seems to work
270:53 - most of the time with most of the
270:57 - geometry
271:00 - so like that
271:04 - that good that looks good
271:07 - that looks
271:08 - okay
271:11 - and that also looks good okay so now we
271:14 - have only selected the frames for the
271:16 - windows
271:18 - which means we can
271:21 - create a new layer
271:22 - shift of five enter fill it with black
271:25 - color
271:26 - okay
271:28 - took us a while but we we we managed we
271:31 - managed to do it
271:33 - um
271:34 - let's change the
271:36 - the intensity
271:39 - so that you can see the line work
271:41 - and for the door
271:44 - um
271:45 - for the doors both of them actually this
271:47 - one still needs
271:50 - oh come on just give me the
271:52 - this one still needs the framing
271:56 - and for some reason it chooses to do it
271:58 - like that
272:00 - to select it like that so let me just
272:03 - for this frame i'll just do it the
272:05 - old-fashioned way
272:07 - with the rectangular marquee tool
272:16 - there we go
272:18 - almost
272:20 - almost
272:22 - now there we go um
272:25 - is that my frames yes that that this my
272:27 - frames shift f5 okay
272:29 - okay we're done here
272:31 - and then select
272:33 - the door
272:35 - somehow
272:37 - that that
272:38 - doesn't let me so i will be using a
272:42 - marquee tool again
272:45 - so the door
272:47 - as well as the door here
272:51 - holding down the shift key to
272:55 - select the door
272:57 - um
272:58 - so these will
272:59 - be
273:00 - blue
273:03 - just because i can
273:06 - no i'm kidding
273:08 - it's not going to be blue i'm just going
273:10 - to
273:11 - color it blue
273:13 - and
273:14 - change it to multiply
273:18 - that's color burn that's not change it
273:20 - to multiply change the opacity to
273:24 - be
273:25 - 33 ish
273:27 - 36
273:29 - ctrl u
273:31 - hello ctrl u
273:33 - why can't i
273:35 - control u there we go ctrl u and then
273:38 - change the hue until i find a nice nice
273:40 - color for the doors
273:43 - um what works with corten steel
273:46 - yellow of course would work but that's
273:49 - kind of boring
273:54 - um
273:57 - pink
273:59 - red
274:00 - maybe red
274:02 - or maybe yeah let's let's just do
274:05 - do it traditional peachy
274:08 - okay
274:09 - that is that uh let's call it uh call it
274:12 - a day i i think that's that looks fine
274:15 - good good enough for for a tutorial uh
274:18 - control
274:19 - shift
274:20 - or rather control s straight up
274:24 - uh to save it uh let me go to desktop
274:29 - find my pdfs
274:32 - find my pdfs find my pdfs oh my god
274:35 - where are they
274:36 - car project
274:39 - raw pdfs goddammit raw pdfs change this
274:42 - to a pdf photoshop pdf format and then
274:46 - find my street facade there we go
274:51 - i can turn off layers right now don't
274:54 - need them hit save
274:56 - do you want to replace it yes
274:59 - okay
275:01 - uh high quality print
275:03 - preserve photoshop editing capabilities
275:05 - i usually have this turned off hit save
275:08 - pdf
275:12 - oh yeah of course
275:14 - i have it opened right here and also i
275:18 - have it opened right here
275:20 - so let me close it here and try to save
275:24 - it again oh just
275:26 - yikes um
275:27 - [Music]
275:29 - control s
275:32 - pdf
275:34 - pdf
275:36 - uh
275:37 - street facade
275:39 - no layers don't need that save yes
275:41 - replace it hit ok
275:44 - let's save pdf
275:47 - okay this time it worked
275:49 - so now
275:50 - once i
275:52 - close this
275:54 - and turn this off i can see that my
275:57 - street facade here is
276:00 - is nice
276:01 - and crispy so
276:03 - if you have adobe acrobat pro version
276:06 - you can select all of your pdfs right
276:08 - click them
276:10 - choose
276:12 - combine pdfs in acrobat
276:16 - then you just move them around
276:19 - so that's going to be the title page and
276:22 - then we have uh floor plans and then
276:25 - um
276:28 - poor plants
276:30 - yeah sure i that this works or maybe
276:32 - section goes in here
276:34 - it goes up
276:35 - up until there
276:37 - um
276:38 - we
276:39 - click on combine why is this so big
276:44 - we click on combine
276:47 - it does its magic
276:49 - creates a binder we can we take a closer
276:52 - look at it
276:54 - first second third fourth fifth page
276:58 - for me
277:00 - i hit file
277:02 - save as
277:04 - um we go to i'll just save it to desktop
277:08 - and this is where i go
277:11 - this is important you guys a a d a
277:16 - 15
277:19 - l
277:20 - f
277:22 - i forgot my last name
277:24 - here they kiss
277:30 - save
277:33 - that's it you're done right you have
277:35 - your
277:36 - uh your pdfs
277:39 - where is it
277:40 - where is it there we go
277:42 - there it is you have your pdf saved
277:46 - right
277:48 - um and then you just uploaded it to
277:51 - the school server
277:55 - uh i already did a tutorial on how to do
277:58 - it before so i will not be repeating
278:01 - that
278:02 - but or maybe maybe i should okay so i
278:05 - will repeat that so
278:07 - if you're in the school
278:10 - then you
278:11 - can
278:12 - let me just mimic me being in the school
278:15 - without being in the school
278:17 - um ma'am
278:22 - bam
278:23 - ma'am just a second
278:26 - so in the school
278:28 - uh you just go to
278:30 - temp
278:35 - folder
278:37 - unprotected
278:42 - and you
278:44 - aad 15
278:47 - hand in
278:50 - beautiful writing
278:52 - capital h capital h hendon
278:56 - there we go ada 15 handen
278:59 - open up that folder
279:02 - drag and drop or drag and drop not the
279:04 - syllabus
279:06 - the
279:07 - your your file in here
279:10 - that's it you've passed the course right
279:14 - if you don't have access if you can't
279:17 - get into the school
279:19 - remember that there is a remote desktop
279:23 - option
279:24 - right
279:25 - all of the
279:26 - information
279:27 - is in the on the course website under uh
279:31 - useful resources so there is a remote
279:33 - desktop version where you can
279:36 - log into the school's computer from your
279:39 - browser
279:41 - and just send an email to yourself with
279:44 - the file and load it in
279:50 - load it in through the remote remote
279:52 - desktop
279:54 - that that should be
279:56 - pretty simple to do as well so there's
280:00 - no need for us to do a separate server
280:03 - or a separate folder
280:05 - uh you just do it that way either one of
280:08 - the ways works
280:10 - alternatively you can always just
280:13 - create a vpn connection and that that's
280:15 - going to work as well
280:17 - okay
280:18 - i will leave you to it
280:20 - get to work
280:22 - and
280:23 - i hope to see some really nice
280:26 - narrow houses from you

Cleaned transcript:

autodesk revit is a building information modeling software for architects engineers and designers in this university course you will learn how to use revit for 3d modeling and design so this one is going to be focused on giving you the basis for working in revit so i'm going to probably record three videos three tutorial videos just showing from start to finish how to produce a very very simple very very basic project in revit so the course itself has a website of course and as long students you already have seen the course those of you who are not fluent students can also kind of jump in jump into the website by just writing down this this address here and in the course we have a lot of information here but that's not not not that important what's important is um where is it oh my god i will need to reformat this uh what's important is what kind of a client you're going to choose your your fictional client for for the project and also uh this supplementary material right so we will not be starting from scratch we will be using a 3d model that i've made um to get you guys started to just have some sort of a environment ready for us to model in so there are these two links here site 3d model and sat format and site 3d model in rhino 5 format the reason i use rhino5 is because i just make sure that everyone can follow along you know with the older version of rhino so i have already kind of made it and downloaded it and so on once you do that and you open it up you will see this 3d model right here so the task of the course is going to be um to 3d model out some sort of a building in between these two so it's you know it's it's kind of a challenge it's it's quite a narrow one and these are called narrow buildings for a reason right um right so we will let's just take a closer look at it in arctic view there's nothing fancy i believe i just extracted some dwg file from uh lund city um and just modeled out a few few buildings from that dwg file so we are now looking in rhino but this course is about revit so let's stop looking at it in rhino and rather let's look at it in revit so in revit once you open up revit you will be presented with this window here um and basically it's asking you to create a new file right to start working so we will do exactly that i will click on new models new and here it's going to ask me what kind of template do i want to use and it asks you whether or not you would like to use imperial units or metric units so i will be using metric of course in sweden we do use metric system um and if you don't see it here you can always click on browse and then expand the top bar here go back to uh templates so 1 1 4 up or so to say and here you will see english or we just ah let's go for english default metric we can use that one so it's it's either one you matter i'll use default metric that that seems fine i'll just hit open yep sure hit ok and it's going to load up a new file for us once that's done i will immediately save it just so that auto saving kicks in and if it crashes or anything like that i don't lose a lot of information so i'll go to file save as oh can i just save i'll save yeah i can just save well here i'll just save it to my desktop because i don't have a folder for it ada15 tutorials sure hit save that's it so so you're done with that right so let's start with me showing you the user interface or either kind of quickly going through the user interface so here in in the right and the top we have a few mostly used shortcut buttons such as open file save file plot undo redo check dimension and so on right so those are kind of handy but i don't tend to use them that often if i need to save something i'll just click on this file tab and just choose to save here i don't know why but that's just how i do it and here right below those shortcut buttons you have your tabs your tabs where all of the tools in revit are located so i already showed you the file tab well it's not really a tab but the file button here for opening a new file or creating a new file opening up a file existing one saving all all of that good stuff um so that's not interesting but what's interesting is these tool tabs here we have architecture we will be using quite a bit of it of the tools in architecture tab of course uh this is like the main one structure tab uh we will almost not be wait let me see no we will not be using anything from the structure tab even though it's it's super for for engineering purposes but since this is just uh like a proposal level entrylevel project that we're doing we don't really need needed then we have steel precast and systems tabs all of these are engineering related we don't care about them insert tab basically lets you import or insert stuff that's not native to revit such as dwg files and and whatnot images we will be using a little bit of it annotate tab um actually quite useful i'm not sure if we will be using it though maybe text we will see but annotate is basically dimensions text tags symbols all of that good stuff is in the annotate tab analyze we will not be using that messing inside um in this case uh for this particular course i'm not sure if we are going to be using it but in aada 20 in the next course i believe we will so you'll need to wait for that collaborate basically it helps you if you're working in a team uh tools here help you collaborate with other people working on the same project quite a strong tool uh but given the situation of of code and not not being able all of us not being able to be in the school uh we will be skipping skipping this tab right here view tab quite um yeah we will be using it quite quite a bit um basically just is used to make sections to extract 3d views elevations and also changing the the graphics of the drawings themselves i will be revisiting it quite a bit manage addins and modify um these three tabs we will not be using that much well modify tab you will notice when we will be double clicking on or changing some sort of geometry modify tab will automatically open up with additional uh tools uh that that can be used for that precise geometry for instance if you create a floor slab and you want to edit the boundary of the of the floor slab uh then you um i believe double click it or click on edit i don't remember i'm not a revit user by the way um but it will open up the modify tab where you will have additional tools available for you to modify the boundary of the floor you'll see that in action in just a second okay so that's all about the tabs then here on the left hand side you have the the properties so these are the properties of every piece of geometry that there is if that you have selected right if you don't have anything selected that means the the properties will show you uh the settings for the view itself and in this case we are in level one so we're looking at the top of for for level one that's that's our view and it's basically the properties or the settings for that particular view uh once we have some geometry in here i will talk about the properties a little bit more uh then we have our project browser which is basically all of our views all of our floor plans and so on are going to be located here so right now since we loaded up the default template uh it already has a few a few views set up for us and actually it has too many so we don't need that many views right now and what i'm going to do is i will probably get rid of yeah let's get rid of them so for instance ceiling plants we don't really need any ceiling plants whatsoever so i'll just single click to select level one and hit delete single click to select just make sure that you are deleting ceiling plants not the floor plans right i select level two delete don't need those as for elevations we will be creating our own elevations so we don't really need that as well so i'll delete the east north south west elevations as well all right so now we we only see level one level two and site actually level two i'll get rid of that as well okay so now we only have level one and site uh two two plants i want to import my geometry into the model right sorry my geometry by my geometry i mean the surrounding environment into this revit model to actually have something to work work with to do that i will go to uh insert i'll choose to import cad right import cad which is going to basically ask me where's the model and what kind of format should i use so as you can see here it does accept rhino files which is great we we can use the the rhino file aeda15 site that's fine or if that gives you an error sometimes it does just to be safe uh there's also an option to import sat file acis sat file um so that sat file is also located let me just add right here site 3d model in set format so if rhino gives you problems importing rhino gives you problems just import the sat file uh i'll import the set file i guess so i'll select that select the set file that i have downloaded um blah blah blah import as category so that's an important one basically in revit every piece of geometry belongs to a geometry category right so revit needs to to know what kind of geometry is it is it a column is it a ceiling is it a door you know what what is it so here uh our site model is neither one of those things right so we will be importing it is it as a generic model so i'll hit on open generic model is basically yeah just anything geometry that doesn't have a type and it seems like it's import it has been imported good enough seems like it's fine okay so we have our geometry here that's great and we have these doodads right here which we don't really need so these are leftovers from where we had the elevations elevation views these were markers for elevation views i think i'll just delete them delete delete so i'm just selecting them uh just click delete click delete if you don't have them that's even better okay so we have our top view of our generic model that's cool and all but we kind of want to uh also see it in 3d right no just to understand uh how well did it import so to do that we can go to view and we can create view tab and we can create 3d view that's it that's all we needed to do um so now on to how do we navigate in the viewport in the 3d viewport in revit so you do it by holding down the shift key and clicking the scroll wheel clicking and dragging the scroll wheel you can rotate if you just click and drag the scroll wheel you pan scroll wheel right now there's not a lot of things going on here nothing too fancy um but that's fine all right so we have our 3d model here and let's start creating some or rather preparing to create some um some geometries so what i like doing is oh by the way sorry every view that you open will be shown here in these tabs so you can easily switch between them or you can just double click on the on the name of the view here level one uh so in revit you always work not always but most of the time you work in plan views like um what would be a good example like in sims like in that video game sims um you kind of work in plan view and the 3d view is just represent it it becomes like a representation of that so all of the drawing and drawing of walls and whatnot is done in plan view so in level one okay so let's start off by actually giving it a few axes that's at least what i like to do in this case it doesn't really make a lot of sense but i still like to do it just to keep it clean so i'll go to architecture tab and i'll choose grid here grid bam and as you can see immediately once i chose the grid option it gives me it it takes me to modify tab where it basically asks us how would you like to place the grid where would you like to place the grid axis so i will do that by just clicking on these endpoints and the snapping is kind of kind of nice in revit so i'll click on one of the corners of the surrounding buildings and i'll drag out the grid line here that's our first grid line and i'll do the same thing for the second one from here to here and align them perfect so that's our grid axis one and grid axis two um i could do grid axis three and four maybe we should so grid axis three um i wonder should it should we do it here or should we do it here let's do it here so that's our grid axis three oh come on there we go and that's going to be our grid access form bam done once you've done that you just hit escape that's all that's all right so now i will just clean them up a little bit so i'll click on this uh arrow key here or i believe i can just hit escape once more um and then it will automatically go to my arrow key or arrow tool i'll select let's say grid access three and i'll add this this markup three i will add it to the other side as well right here three so let me do that again you select grid access three and there's a tick mark box on the other side right which you tick and then it's basically it understands that oh okay i need to show uh the grid axis okay that's good for grid access for we do the same thing we find that tick box here sometimes it's hard to see it of course it starts auto saving let's wait there we go red x is four then there same thing for axis one and same thing for axis 2. let me drag them out a little bit so that it's nice and tidy there we go up there we go i might need to squish the scooch grid axis three and four closer uh to the to the building but that's gonna be done later for now this is good enough um so in architecture you don't really have a grid axis going in both directions being marked in numbers so if in one direction grid axes are marked in numbers one two three four five and the other one they're going to be marked in letters a b c d blah blah blah so here for grid access three where it says name let me do that again maybe it's a little bit too fast i'll select grid axis 3 and i'll say that no this is not 3 this is a so i select it once i selected the properties changes and here where it says name i will just change this to a hit apply very good same thing for a grid access 4. instead of 4 i change this to b there we go okay so now we are all set we are all set to start uh start making our building right so before um i wonder which which yeah let's start with walls right i think we should start with walls um so to to add a wall there is this wall tool the of course it's under architecture tab wall if i expand it i can see that there are a few options here but for now we don't care about those options we just care about the regular wall tool right so i will not be expanding that that tool i'll click on the wall tool and before i start just going to town drawing it i will choose instead of having basic wall generic 200 millimeters i will choose a thicker one actually the one that that we should be using is like 400 500 millimeters but we don't have it in in this drop down list so i will probably just just say yeah screw it let's do 300 millimeters who cares right but usually you when working in an office you do have a library that office itself has a library of walls that that office uses right um and and then you can just choose from from that library here it's just generic stuff so yeah sure we will just use generic stuff so 300 millimeters it is um i believe in in sweden it's it's right now the regulation is around you can't get away with walls that are thinner than around 500 millimeters due to heat insulation being so so thick but i might be wrong about that at least at least in the baltic region it's it's 500 millimeters but 300 is fine here um okay so we have our wall type then we have our location line and also it's it's kind of the mostly used settings are kind of here in the in the top row uh where it basically asks for what kind of height the wall should have um what's the location of the line so let me explain how how that works so to determine height of the wall let's do unconnected right so it's it's height and it's unconnected right and the the unconnected height from level one upwards here is set to be eight hundred eight thousand millimeters so eight meters right um and so that's fine that's fine for us right now because i'm just showing you how it works um but the nice thing about it is that you can have it connected to the second floor right so if you change the height of the second floor the height of the wall will change as well i will show that in just a second uh for now let's have it unconnected eight 000 location of the line center line so if it's center line and i start drawing a wall you can see that it draws as if that that line through which i draw the wall is right in the middle of the wall so i don't really need that i don't really want that um i want the wall to go inwards here right so instead of a center line i will say finish face exterior right and then i'll start start drawing the wall as if it's not as if but i will start drawing the wall clockwise so that the exterior is is is on the outside like that like that so i'm just kind of snapping it that's it right we have we have our wall if i check it in 3d i kind of look at it that's our wall that we just drew and it's exactly eight meters high right let me jump back to level one you just uh see a few more uh a few more settings that that can be changed so let me delete that all together um grab the wall tool again um and and continue on with with the with the settings so here we have a chain chain is basically once you finished drawing one segment of the wall it will ask you to continue drawing the other segment and then the other and then the other right so it chains segments of the wall like a polyline it basically works like a polyline rather than a line tool offset is basically let's say 250 ml offset from where we draw and that's the bad offset let's say offset minus 250 to the other side so you can see it draws the wall with an offset of 250 millimeters from our reference line so that's uh sometimes handy uh this time it's not so let me yeah okay so offset um resets itself to zero if you escape out of the tool radius um have no idea what the radius is we can actually check yeah it's a little bit laggy ah okay so radius is basically a fillet of the wall so we don't really care about the radius at least for for for my example i will not be using any fillet corners and joint status allow or disallow it's basically when you make a corner of two walls do you want them to merge into one uh one geometry or not geometry but would should all of the layers inside of the walls kind of merge together nicely so i always have it set to be allowed all right let's actually do do something let's draw something because this is getting boring so i'll go to the website and here i will just quickly read that um we have three clients to choose from right annabelle which is an arts curator uh brian which is a car enthusiast or clementine which is a musician and i think i will go for animal in in for this particular tutorial just because i don't a or annabelle um and b for brian huh so annabelle is an arts curator and is looking to expand her gallery she wants the ground floor of her house to be open to public and should work as a small art gallery exhibition area she will live above this gallery so all other floors need to be private okay her stylistic preference is minimalist which with occasional strong color accents she has she has a cat no family so that will help us determine the the the living room or bedroom area and and so on okay uh first floor public second floor private uh gallery in the first floor um all other floors are living spaces easy let's jump back to revit and let's let's plan this out so you have a street here right and you have people walking along and you have you want this area to be the arts gallery right so i will say i will say the arts gallery itself is going to be or rather the entrance is going to be pushed in a little bit from the street so that there can be like a small gathering before an arts exhibition opening or something like that people like to go outside and smoke and have a chat and not stay indoors that much so you do need a little bit of space in the front right you don't want them to just be standing here on the street so i will be insetting this uh this building a little bit inwards uh to do that i need one more grid line because i like to keep things tidy so i will choose my grid tool here and instead of drawing the grid line i will do one one fancy not fancy but one additional like thing with it which is instead of here instead of drawing a line a grid line from point to point oh by the way sorry forgot when you hover your mouse over a tool it will show you what that tool does very handy um i will choose this tool right here pick lines the clients will help me determine from where do i from which line do i create a new grid line right and then i will say that actually i will my plan is to pick line b this this grid line here right come on okay it doesn't let me but that's fine it at least it lets me pick the the street uh straight line that's fine as well so i will be using this line here and i will be offsetting it inwards by i don't know 1.5 meters something like that i think 1.5 should should do the trick yeah let's do 1.5 ish uh meters so i am picking the line with this tool and here when where it says offset i will choose 1500 for the offset right and then i just pick this line and already without clicking it already shows me where it's going to place the line if i want to place it on the other side by the way i can i can just type in minus 1500 and it's going to place it on the other side okay so click that's it create a third um why is there's uh no no no no no no sorry about that for some reason there there was um grid line d as well i don't want that again grid quick line 1 500 um come on down okay there we go so now i just created one gridline that there was a i explained it to too much and i made too many gridlines um right so we have that oh right that's why that's because i keep clicking on it without actually looking that i'm still creating gridlines so this is how you can create gridlines quite fast with that offset offset tool but we don't need that so i will just be deleting all of these and i'll be just looking at gridline e which i'll pull back i'll pull back this one here create a tick mark uh not put the tick mark down red line e that's actually not e that is the new b grid line i wonder if it's going to let me do that no it doesn't i first need to change the grid line b here to c and this one is going to be gridline there we go we're good okay so that's going to be the inset of my um of my floor not my floor but off of my first floor walls let's actually let's create the walls right so bam walls uh finish face exterior great chain great let's just do it bam bam bam bam bam and yes i know it's right now unconnected but we are fine with that okay so we have done that right and if i take a look at it in 3d view bam there we go we have our our walls uh here shown and they are exactly eight meters high which is way too much but that's that's okay we'll fix that by the way if you don't like this wireframe view it's not wireframe line uh hidden line view if you don't like this hidden line view you can always go here to the oh wait there we go you can always go here to the bottom of the window and click on visual style hidden line here and choose shaded for instance and then you'll see the shaded view i just prefer to keep it clean at the start so i just use the hidden line view okay we have that done so now i want to actually create um actually connect sorry not create but actually connect these walls to level two right so that if i need to for some reason change the height of level two i can layer down the line so i will do that by first of all i need to create level two because here i only have level one right the ground floor level uh so i need to create level two and the way you do it is by actually um describing it or marking it out in the elevation view or in a section view so to do that first of all we need to create a section view or an elevation view and this is where actually creating views before the design starts start uh actually makes sense right um so let's do that um i will go to view here view and i'll choose to create an elevation view actually i'll make two of them one for the back side of the building and one for the front side right so elevation click that's in the view tab elevation click and it's basically asks me would i like to attach it to a grid and not not really i don't really care about attaching it to the grid i'll just do something like this right place it like that and it immediately looks at the at the facade that i've made and i'll do the same thing for the side here maybe a little bit further down there we go so we have two elevations here one and two and i can actually rename them as well sorry i first want to move move this bad boy away so these are basically the points from which we start looking at elevations or rather elevation markers um i will select my table sorry my table is falling apart okay so i will select one of them and i'll just take a look at what what can be what can be done with it so there are two ways of how you can select it first one is let me zoom in first first way to select it is if you select the circle right if you select the circle there's not much that you can that you can change here right you can kind of add a type and and choose a different and you even choose yeah you can kind of choose a different style for for this markup but other than that nothing else um well you can add more elevations from that point but we don't care about it uh yes please delete it okay um but what we do care about is this little arrow here this black arrow once we select the arrow then we have a lot of things that are going on first of which if we zoom out we can see this box here uh partially dashed line box partially blue line box that's uh that has appeared so this box right here basically tells us how wide the elevation is going to be right that view that we are going to generate how wide is it going to be so i'm going to take that and i'm going to push it to be quite narrow up until here and quite narrow up until here right because that's all we need we just need it to be there and so so that's the width and these two arrows here are the depth so if i click and drag on those i can say that i actually want to see it in my elevation view i want to see the background building if it's going to show up but i do want to see it right so i am kind of describing how far we are going to see that's one i'll do the same thing for the other one i'll change the width like that and the length like that should be good enough you can change the length uh any way you want as long as you know you show the stuff that you want to show um i will just rename them because i think that's that's kind of important so let me just see which one is which actually uh yeah it will from time to time it will ask you to save the project sure i will just click on save and here i just double clicked on elevation 2a and i'll just drag it out so sorry i i'm doing it automatically sorry um when you have uh double clicked on either elevation one a or elevation two a doesn't matter once you double clicked on them uh for the first time they will generate the view right so once the view has been generated it's going to kind of load up faster um and let's say elevation one a you can see this border that's clipping out or clipping away our view so i will select that border and i will drag on these these dots here i i'm able to drag it so that i can see more of this border or within this border like that and the width i will not be messing around too much with the width that's fine and maybe we can get away with something like this so this narrow thing right here is going to be our building and if i look at it in 3d view i can see that um okay i can see that we do see a balcony here and in 3d view i can see balcony is there that means that elevation 1a is actually our street elevation and elevation two a is going to be our uh garden elevation i don't know backside elevation so i will just extend come on higher it's a little bit laggy but that's fine that's that's not a big deal there we go so elevation 2a is our back elevation so i will actually rename them because i think that's important you can right click on elevation 1a or you can just single click on its name and choose to rename it to street elevation come on elevation and then elevation 2a is going to be back elevation there we go that's it so we have that done and now back to back to what we we had before uh we we need to specify our uh levels right in in the elevations actually now uh let's let's create a section or rather two sections first and then we will do the levels so back to level one here we do have two elevations already prepared now let's create two sections so section markup or rather section is generated through the view tab as well it's under section here if i click on it it basically just asks me to give it uh a line right draw a line uh through which we will cut uh so i will draw just draw a line right through the middle of the building like so and can i click on that yes i can okay so right in the middle of that line you can see the zigzag here if i click on it then i can then i'm able to kind of drag away that section line away from the building i don't want it to be present inside of the building because i'm going to be designing uh like walls in it and i don't want the section line to get in the way okay so that's our section it kind of works in the similar way as our elevations you have you know how wide it is and also how deep it is right so here i'll just specify the depth like so yeah i think that's that's good so that's our section a a right and i can i can rename it and so on we will do that i think a little bit later uh i'll just call it section one for now i'll keep it as section one if we take a look at it it's nothing too fancy you know it's just a bunch of a bunch of lines nothing nothing more nothing fancy at all just move it up here we go perfect okay um so so that is done that's our section one and let's do section two across section so bam bam and i will be repositioning the sections uh later of course uh so that they show more uh and that that i'm not cutting at awkward places but for now just having everything here i think is great so so that you don't forget okay so we have that section two is also generated let me just make it nicer bam right now it's not it's not gonna look nice but that's fine we will make it look nice layer down the line okay almost there we will be finishing up by creating floor floors so level one is here and as i mentioned before you can add more levels as long as you're in either elevation or a section view so in elevation view i will just go to wait where is it architecture oh yeah sorry it's under architecture in the architecture tab it's level right so it's not under view tab it's under architecture tab level as a level to the model okay so the way i'm going to work with this is i will be rebuilding right now i've been using the gener generic levels i will just rebuild all of the levels from scratch which is going to be easy uh quite quite fast so level here and i will just say my first level right doesn't it snap oh there we go it does snap so there's like two lines here i need to make sure that i'm snapping to the correct one why are there two lines here let me see three oh okay so the two lines are there because my plate here my ground plate has a thickness of course so that's why in let's say street elevation or that doesn't matter back elevation uh we see these two lines right that that's the thickness of the ground so i do need the first one the top one to work as my ground floor level from here to here it says level three but that's that's that's fine that's fine uh level three is okay i'll hit escape and we will be renaming them either way that's level three then i will choose to rather than drawing i'll choose to use the pick lines tool because i have a grid line here a picc lines tool and i will say offset you know by how much will we offset from here so i'm picking i'm going to be picking this level 3 line which it doesn't let me pick that well hello let me i saw you ah there we go so we will be offsetting from this line and for some reason oh okay so it doesn't let me pick the the grid line it only lets me pick lines from the mall that's fine that's okay as well um by by specifying the offset i will specify the height of my first floor right so let's go for three meters because i think that's that's just a or maybe the gallery space could be a little bit higher the ceiling height could be higher so let's go for three and a half meters so 3500 from here up there we go level four right and then then um all other spaces will be three meters high right so the ceiling height will be three meters so three meters here um three meters here let's see let's see can i fit i'm just thinking if i can fit the the whole building into three floors so first floor is going to be the gallery space which is yeah that's just used up second floor um kitchen living room bathroom third floor bedroom work work room now we we won't be able to to fit kitchen bedroom kitchen living room and bathroom into one floor so just in case i'll add a third floor here or or fourth floor and we'll see how we can kind of work around with it so that's our levels now it's time to make them nice let's escape out a bunch of times from our tool and then let's just make them nice in this in in this particular view so here i'll just make sure that they're shown on both sides even though we don't need it actually we don't need it sorry sorry don't don't do that don't do that so let's untick the right hand side and just keep it at the left hand side and then here i'm just going to rename them so i'll select level 3 and call it hello level three why do you not yeah there we go or okay let's do it this way here where it says level three i'll just click on the name of it and i'll just call it round floor would you like to rename corresponding level and views yes becomes ground floor level four is going to be first floor yes level five is going to be ah accidentally double clicked on it level five is going to be second floor don't show me this message again there we go level six third four and then we have level seven wait am i making a skyscraper let's see uh so that's first or ground floor first floor second floor third floor oh yeah and then it would be fourth floor but i can just say yeah let's keep it consistent so fourth floor okay so that's done uh let me now delete level one and the site um floor plans because we don't need them anymore level one deleted site deleted there we go now we're good to go so that's our ground floor looks like that we'll need to kind of make it nice again but that's fine then we have our second floor third floor fourth floor fifth floor uh our first floor actually the the way it's arranged here sucks so i'll just say zero dash ground floor 3500 dash first floor i hope you you understand what i'm what i'm doing here 6500 dash this is in millimeters how high each floor is then we have 9500 dash third floor and we have uh 12500 dash or floor yes to have all of them kind of stacked up nicely because it goes along the alphabetical order all right almost there not almost there we're done with the the floor plans let's see uh with adding the floor plans so now i'll make everything tidy again by just uh putting down the tick marks where uh where they need to be and cutting open the sections so that they are not in the way uh while i'm doing that questions that you will have are well usually questions that students have can you just use the wall of this building of the surrounding building rather than build your own wall here because it becomes a double wall the answer to that is no you can't you need to build your own wall um then another question would be wait yeah can you change the style of the grid axes and the elevation markups and the section markups and whatnot uh my answer to that is yes you can as long as you download the as you as long as you download them i did the styles i mean and honestly it's too much of a hassle to find a nice one and download it and get it get it going so instead my suggestion would be to just stick stick to these ones uh and if you want to make it nicer then when you plot it out when you plot this this out as a pdf uh change it in photoshop straight up i mean it's gonna take you what 15 minutes to to change all of the drawings section markups and all maybe 20 uh to change the section markups and all of the plans uh where is the tick mark there we go um but it's it's you will have full control over the style of it um yeah yeah that that's that's about it so it created a bunch of ceiling plants as well uh every time when you create a floor uh it will create a ceiling plan as well we don't care about the ceiling plans again and just to be sure that you're not going into the ceiling plans delete them because i i get so many questions about the ceiling plants and not not the ceiling plants but something is not working and then we take a look and students are drawing in in the ceiling plant trying to draw walls in the ceiling plant never works out okay back to here ground floor bam we have our walls um and here you can see that our walls are being constrained not to ground floor but rather to level one so let me let me explain this a little bit more i think i need to explain this a little bit more every geometry in rhino almost every geometry in rhino this is not rhino this is revit goddammit every geometry in revit can be and usually is attached or constrained to some other geometry or a thing an object which makes revit quite parametric in that sense if something changes other things will follow along which is nice but also it adds much more settings for you to kind of remember and know about one of those settings is base constraint so if i select this floor this is not a floor this is a wall if i select this wall right here in the ground floor plan and i choose uh i i take a look at its properties i can see that it's a basic wall it's a generic wall nothing fancy there it does have a base constraint right and it's constrained to level one that's because we drew it in level one even though level one doesn't exist here anymore it's still constrained to it so that doesn't make any sense right so we need to either redraw it in ground floor so that the bottom of the wall all always will follow the ground floor the height of the ground floor or we can just change change it here base constraint move that out find uh ground floor there we go same thing for all other ones if you hold down the control key you can select many walls at once and you can constrain all of them to ground floor so now if ground floor moves the walls will follow along then let me actually have all of them selected then you have a base offset this is basically how high does the do these walls are these walls offset from the ground floor plane right so right now it's zero meaning that they are right on the ground floor and then you have if it's 250 they'll kind of be floating 25 centimeters above the ground floor then you have top constraint which is unconnected sure and you have unconnected height so this is basically it's always going to have the same height of 8 meters and it's just going to be floating in space if you mess around with the height of the ground floor right if you want it to kind of snap to let's say first floor right up to top constraint up to level 3500 first floor then unconnected height becomes locked right and what that means is if i drag this out it's smaller like that right um and if i go to back elevation let's say so by the way you can have two views here you do something like this right so that's my 3d view of with those walls and that's my back view right so now i can say first floor elevation this guy right here instead of 3500 i can say 4000 right and see how this moved up let me do that again from 4000 i will switch this to 1500 very very small first floor but all of the walls they follow along this is super this is very very useful let's come back to 3500 okay so that's great um and let me close 3d view that's great let's jump back to our ground floor plan and continue continue working on this so by now you already have like um the the perimeter for the first floor or the ground floor now let's do the perimeter for the first floor right here right so here i want the why doesn't it show just a second okay for now we will not be doing that you will see something like this which is okay i will show you how to mess around with the view later later in the tutorials but for now you don't really see in the first floor you don't see the walls which are in the ground floor that's fine because we have these grid axes here and they are here for a reason right so with these grid axes here i will probably specify i i will just draw another perimeter for me to work with so i will create a wall and here is going to be a generic wall it's going to start from the first floor perfect um it's going to be actually not unconnected so i can either specify it here or here doesn't matter so it's not going to be unconnected it's going to be connected to the second floor since i'm drawing it in the first floor right the second floor um and it's going to be finished face exterior that's fine yeah nothing else needs to be changed and then i'll just draw it here and this one i will draw full perimeter um oh that's not the full perimeter that's too much of a period okay let me try it again wall yes to the second floor that's perfect uh we draw it from here to here just make sure that you snap to the correct um that you snap to the correct points there we go bam that's it hit escape a bunch of times let's take a look at it in 3d view boom how it looks like in in 3d view right so i have a little bit of a of a nook here or for people to catch a catch a break during a gallery opening or something like that also it's nice it's always nice to have something inside when it's raining so that when you get a tumble for your keys and so on you don't need to stand in the rain okay so we have that done actually maybe i want this to be yeah let's do one thing so now i'm designing i know sorry bear with me i will create a grid line an additional grid line so i'll select i'll choose that i'm going to pick lines and my offset is going to be 1500 again and i'll just offset from grid line a a new grid line which is grid line d and then in the first floor no first floor is fine first layer is fine in the ground floor i will actually take this wall and i'll move it i don't know if i can yes i can there we go i'll just move it to grid line d perfect okay so the reason why i did that is now i have a possibility to do a balcony here right or for my second floor which is great that's exactly what i want okay let's jump back to okay so ground floor is fine right now i'm just blocking out the basic volumes right as as i'm as i'm moving forward with this so that's ground floor first floor is here second floor for the second floor so that's a balcony do we do one more balcony here do we make it smaller and smaller that's the question let's do it simple okay so here i'll just create a wall uh that's gonna be yeah locked to the third floor and i'm just going to say from here to here nothing fancy from here to here to here to here here something like that that's good i won't even show you that third floor and third floor i'm thinking of creating one more grid line and doing an offset of two meters uh yeah picking the line doing an offset of two meters inwards so that it kind of lines from grid line a to grid line e here and the reason why i do two meters is how did i know that it's two meters for alignment is first of all it's it's always done in increments of 50 centimeters right these kind of building offsets and so on usually around 50 centimeters and here it's mere uh one meter 500 so i just assume that it's going to be one more step so that that becomes two meters um oops don't need that grid line okay so here i'm thinking of having it okay so we're drawing a wall but it's going to be a super small one like that okay let's take a look at it in 3d oh and uh sorry i need to make sure that it's up to level four okay great so it is locked to level four now um so this is how it looks the the block out how the blockout looks like that's not good that's a pretty ugly yeah i hate that 1400 no sorry uh 1440 centimeters okay so what if we do straight up 10 meters it's probably not going to be enough huh all right that's actually yeah but then you put on a roof and so on so it becomes shitty again we will need to kind of take a closer look at that and see if if it if it looks bad with the roof on but for now this is how this is how it looks that's our block out okay let's uh create some floor slabs right because right now if i take a look at a section of it um and let's just shade it real fast shade that section dash or save the project um you don't really see any any floor slabs that's because we of course you don't see any floor slabs that's because we haven't created any the so let's create some floor slabs i'll show you how to so i'll come back to ground floor and usually you don't really need to create a floor slab from the for the ground floor for a proposal level uh project because it's already on the ground but uh whatever let's go to architecture tab and let's choose floor here floor and it's going to ask us to basically what kind of floor do we want so 1500 is a little bit thin um i'm thinking more about well let's let's see this is only three meters well yeah around three meters actually the thousand five hundred is not that thin that's fine let's use that and here i can either draw a boundary line or i can pick walls right so i can just click click click click that's easy right just picking walls uh or i can pick lines as well you know as long as you create a perimeter it's going to make a floor slab inside of that perimeter this tool does that it's really really simple how it works so yeah let me just hit finish editing mode that's it that's our floor slab right there um right same thing for first floor actually let's take a look at this section so the floor slab goes down into the ground which is fine there are going to be things that we will need to kind of investigate with with the other uh with the the first floor also why are you you need to be here and you need to be gone there we go so let's do first floor because it's going to be a little bit more tricky due to the balcony and the cantilever here first floor there we go a floor slab and here we have a balcony right remember that we hope you do we have a balcony here and we have a cantilever here so let's see how we can do this i will just pick lines for now and i'll just say this this this and this these four lines here except lines cannot intersect each other um continue okay so it doesn't let me uh intersect the lines that's fine i can just draw the lines myself that's okay let me cancel quit uh are you sure you want to discard four yes uh so i will just do it again this time i'll choose floor and instead of picking lines i will just draw my own line um like that that like that easy right so i'm just using the line tool once i'm done i hit the accept button here uh would you like walls to go up to this floor's level to attach to its bottom would you like ah would you like walls that go up to this floor's level you attach to its bottom attach i don't know okay so we have our floor slab here um this is sketchy let's look at it in this section actually looks good okay looks looks not not that bad looks fine uh this one though this should extend to the outside of well not really it shouldn't it shouldn't extend to the outside of the wall but oh me i know i know i know i know how we're going to deal with this so let me explain this wall and this wall and this floor make a very awkward connection here what we want is we want this wall to go into the ground as if it was a foundation block and we could do foundation blocks i know but i'm lazy so i'll just extend these walls so let's go to ground floor and select these floors and where it says um base offset i'll say minus 500 millimeters hit apply go to section one and now they offset downwards by minus 500 millimeters so we have foundation blocks kinda good enough for this kind of project um one two three three more or rather two more floor slabs and the roof but i will make a flat roof so it's i'm just going to use a floor slab to to make a flat roof um or should i make a angled roof i'll do both i'll show you how to make an angled roof and then i will make a flat roof afterwards so second floor there we go let's do floor and here it's going to be very straightforward it's just going to be picking walls because there's no cantilevers there's no balcony so i'm just picking floors uh picking walls attached um highlighted walls are attached to but miss the highlighted targets yeah sure okay let's see sometimes it gives you errors but i think we are ah that's why so we don't want to attach huh let's let's investigate investigation time so the reason why this happened so that's fine that's okay but this is not uh the reason why this happened is that these walls the bottom ones i think or maybe the top ones now the bottom ones the bottom walls had to move down since we said to attach they moved down to let the floor slab in but the problem is that the floor slab only reaches the inside of the walls not the outside so honestly i'm going to fix it by detaching here let me ctrl z delete let me do it again actually i could have just left it as it is but i want to show you um how to do it so floor this time i'm going to yeah sure i'll i'll pick walls again intercept but here i'll say don't attach right and now technically yeah now it's fine and in this section it also looks fine good we fixed it now this is going to be a little bit more tricky but we'll make it we'll make it believe i believe so third floor the floor slap is going to go up until here up until grid line a while the walls end here so we get one more balcony and also here we get a balcony or do we wait i don't remember yeah so we got two balconies here we get a lot of balconies we need to take a look at that later on um so in third floor i'm going to create a floor which is going to which is going to go between grid line a and grid line c with this one right here okay so let me just draw it uh it's it's just going to be faster to just draw draw it like that there we go except this time we attach i believe yep um let's take a look at it in the section yeah that's good enough i think yeah okay so that that that that looks good so we have our our volume here um can i and this is our volume with the shadows not much to so you can turn on the shadows by clicking on the shadow icon of course i wonder how do you how do you change this yeah send settings there we go send settings um top left now sign settings up left and there we go not much is going on but you know kind of helps you understand the volume a little bit better maybe maybe i don't know okay so we have that let us continue um so there are two more things that i'm gonna do and then we will finish up this portion of the tutorial um tutorial number one so i am going to show you how to make a roof so making a roof is going to be quite fun let's let's jump to let's jump to the third floor no the fourth floor that's our where our roof is going to be and i just need to know so our walls go between e and b and they reach here so it's it's between e and it's between b so here we have our floors by the way if you are tired of kind of playing detective and not seeing it you can go to view range here view range and choosing that the view depth how deep do you see uh goes a little bit a little bit deeper so let's say unlimited sure unlimited view depth hit apply hit okay and now you will see the the floors all of the floors below below fourth floor so now you see the the walls here um and we will add a roof so this is going to be an angled roof click there we go and it's basically uh it's the same way as drawing a floor slab right you just choose um for instance the walls click click click click like that and here you can choose not there we go so here you can choose what kind of sorry um having having a stroke i think here you can choose what kind of angle the roof will will have so now i'm just kind of clicking on all the walls and hitting accept and this is the roof and if we take a look at it in 3d uh it's the ugliest roof that you could that you could find let me just try to snap it there we go that's done um let's take a look at it there it is so there's a lot of problems with it right the main one being that it's there there's this kind of very weird gap where the the walls end and the roof begins that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever right so so that's that's bad of course um and other things are what if you don't want all all of these slopes to be like that right what what if you want um a roof like this right uh can can you control it of course you can right so i'm going to do it again but this time i'm going to show you how do you fill how do you not make this this ugly gap here right so i'll delete the roof and i'll create a new one roof there we go roof and i'll just choose by the way you need you can choose what kind of a roof you want is it concrete is it uh generic i'll just see generic doesn't matter um and here instead of choosing the walls i will choose to just draw a line i i that's what i prefer to do that that that come on and that's why we save by the way there we go such a mess that oops slightly messed it up but that's fine we will fix it and i mean that point there we go oh my god when you zoom in okay so while this is like when you zoom in too much it's going to redraw the whole model at a higher detail and that's why it lags um i absolutely hate that thing about revit but they insist on doing it so yeah whatever okay so here i just need to move those i'll just need to move that point but that's fine uh for now let's just accept it and this is how the the roof looks like now a little bit better why is it sticking out here why is it is it sticking out it is sticking out did i mess up i think i messed up i think i anchored it to the wrong no i didn't wait so it's not sticking out here what about section two and it is indeed sticking out here but it's sticking out here because i messed up the other side oh yeah that's of course that that's why uh that's because i i misclicked on the other side while i was right here so this is the part that's sticking out so let's fix it you can double click on the roof and then you can change the change the points where where they are that uh cancel how are you even joined don't don't lie to me okay or or you can just draw it again because it's faster oh my god to do it that way okay so let's draw it again click click this time don't mess up click click click there we go okay we have our clean room roof right uh now i'm going to click on this modify icon here so that i can select my um um lines and notice how here we have the angles so i can define um the angles of all of the slopes of each individual slope of the roof so here by default it's set to 30 but what if we do 75 for this side 75 for this side and then these are going to be dasher let's let's do 75 here as well why not why not this is gonna be fun okay so we hit uh finish we take a look at it and that's our new roof great so that's with 75 degree angle again uh not the roof that we want so let's double click on it again or not let's double click on it again there we go and let's mess around with it even further so these icons right here specify which lines define slope right and if i select one of these lines let's see this one it will have a tick mark here that says define slope so for instance if i were to choose this line and say that it doesn't define slope and choose this line and also say and tick the part that says define slope so that it doesn't define slope here as well and change this to something more reasonable let's say 45 degrees and this one change this to 45 degrees as well hit accept now we have a proper you know a proper roof just like this one right well the the walls are disconnected from it but other than that i think it's fine so actually that's that's important how do we connect the walls to the roof so what we can do is we can go to the third floor and we can choose the walls that we want to connect like that we choose these walls right and we want to say yo extend these walls until they attach to the roof so attach so i'll go to when i have this wall selected i'll choose this tool attach top base like that and then i'll just simply click on the roof so you might need to change your view or something like that or just have two views opened and click on the roof and click on the roof there we go so then it attaches and then you yeah you hit escape a bunch of times and take a look at it and uh yeah that's good that's that that's good that's uh that's a wall that's attached to the roof right so that's uh that's how you work with a sloped roof nothing too fancy right another thing is how do you work with a flat roof and this one i i prefer um i just i don't know i i prefer flat roofs so i'll delete this right so immediately the walls come back to being normal because they don't have anything to to attach to and instead in the fourth floor i'll just create a floor right i'll just create a floor i will just choose um i'll just pick walls i think yeah let's just do it super simple pick walls intercept uh would you like two walls to go up to this floor no no we don't we want to keep it as it is so don't attach uh would you like to join geometry cut the overlapping volume out of the walls up yeah sure whatever okay and we're gucci so ah battery no no battery come back i wonder it's going to be alive now right there we go hey okay good um where was i oh yeah one last thing is i am going to be doing concrete railings um so i'm going to be showing that how to do you know for these balconies of course they need railings uh so i'm going to be doing concrete railings uh you might want to do you know regular railings that's that's fine as well it's just remember that by default revit has really really ugly rails so you know take it with caution right use that tool with caution i will show that in in the next tutorial but for now concrete railings those are basically walls right nothing nothing fancy so let's take a look uh i will need a a railing on the third floor two railings actually on the third floor there and there and also i'll need a railing on the first floor yes first floor railing in the garden view and a third floor railing okay so let's start with first floor first ah that's a tank twister first floor railing uh right here right and i'll just grab a wall this time i don't need a 30 centimeter wall um i'll just be using um block work maybe now let's go for generic uh 140 millimeters yeah that that's fine so basic generic wall 140 mil um finish face exterior height this time it's going to be unconnected and it's going to be the height of the railing so um let's go for a meter a meter is a little bit low for railing but i think that's fine usually it's 1.1 let's go for 1.1 there's no um there are cats there so i don't know why i said that doesn't matter okay so we do have our railing there oh it even has an ugly hatch oh i don't like that hatch i wonder if we can get rid of it hidden line so this happens sometimes uh not sometimes it's usually the case that uh certain types of geometries have certain times of representation you know in certain drawings so this one in particular has this ugly ugly brick work hatch which we can i believe fix okay first of all let me escape no i don't want to make a floor quit i think cannot be under yes okay uh so if i select this is going to be me actually investigating how to get rid of that hatch if i select all of these walls and i add a type so i click on edit type here we have the graphics and maybe here i can choose to not have a hatch yeah no pattern hit ok hit apply yeah that that doesn't care that doesn't care at all uh there's one more thing that i could do at the type basic wall structure added structure concrete messing i believe it's somewhere here so that's thermal and that's concrete masonry so i could change change it here with this block or sorry this this that's cut pattern surface pattern i could change it here but i really don't want to really really don't want to let's leave it let's leave it as it is for now um yeah let's not mess around with that sorry for that intermission uh hope you didn't get too bored with me um let's add more uh walls here i can't look at it i'm just going to to change it i'm just going to change its type so i'm going to select these walls and just do foundation generic 200 ml i could do 200 ml or 135 yeah there we go okay so i'm i've just chose a different different type of uh wall for that okay so now let's draw a wall not masonry but rather 135 mil wall from here to oh it goes along the center line no no no no no no no so we will need to switch it push it around yeah yeah save project um so it goes along finish face exterior it goes along it's unconnected it's 1100 no yes 1100 it's chained has this type perfect that's all we need and then we just draw it straight up bam bam bam enter that's drawn and then we have another we have it in another site notice how i'm not creating any geometry whatsoever in the in the 3d view yeah that's that's how you work with revit so here i'm going to draw up am i in the floor escape out of that sorry about that draw walls from here uh oops that was my bad a long long there we go enter so we have our railing here as well all right i think we are we're fine i think we're good with with the with the geometry so far uh one last thing that i want to show you before we finish up uh for today for this tutorial is as you probably can tell i'm not a big fan of the user interface of revit and the clunkiness of it um so one last thing that i want to show you is called a a section box and for that i need to go to so so if i in 3d view if i actually don't want to see all of this crap right especially here what the hell are you delete there we go if i don't want to see all of this crap i can just create a section just a small section of the building itself right so in 3d so i can do that by going to modify yeah i can go to modify tab i can select all of the objects here all of the objects and i can click on this icon right here which is called selection box bam so it will create this kind of a box for me around my everything that i have selected and i can once i select that box i can click and drag the side sides of it right so that i only i only see my building and also that's that's a good way of how to investigate uh the inside of the building so my box is a little bit you know the angle is not that great so let me just switch it to top view here real fast in 3d by just clicking on the on this icon right here top and i will just rotate what the oh it rotates around that that point why um again we do it again rotate this time i will actually look at the tools here so i'll say center of rotation place i will place the center of rotation here perfect and i will rotate it like so bam that's good enough right um that's it uh then we can go back to our 3d view by just clicking on this you know dragging on on on this box here not box yeah it is a box right on the top right hand side and now i can mess around by just moving in the section box and looking at my at my geometry right and that's my block out for now i will change the angle of the sun do i even care i don't care so boston sure i'll just change the time lie okay that's 5 p.m that's my bad 12 no morning no even more yeah that's night time right uh summer solstice apply 9 a.m good eight that's that's even better okay so now the sun is shining inside of my um inside of my building through this section okay i think that's that's good enough for for for today uh so the task is right now after you've watched tutorial one to make this kind of a block out very basic block out of the volumes that you're going to have in the you know in between squished in between those two buildings that you are going to put function in uh into tomorrow so that's that's the task um for those of you who are not sure how you'll manage to fit in you know the bedroom and and whatnot um i would suggest just taking a piece of paper or autocad or whatever and just drawing out the plan basic basic plans you know with the staircases and whatnot just to know what you what you actually want to do right what you actually want to accomplish here i am not doing that just to save time um so my building is going to be worse uh much much worse than your buildings right so other than that i think we are um we're done here go get to work and i'll see you tomorrow so in part one we have finished doing the block out so this is what i would call uh you know a good enough block out for us to start detailing so we basically have the whole proportion going and everything seems to be in order in this regard so now uh what i want to do is i want to focus on um shall we go for doors and windows perhaps yeah let's go for doors and windows so i'll show you different techniques and different ways on how you can create doors and windows in your revit file so to begin let's add a door let's add an entrance door to our building i'll go to ground floor here and actually at this stage i really like doing like i really like splitting um this view into two so here i have my 3d view and my ground floor view right these two views if you don't see a 3d view just double click here right and it will open up the 3d view for you so we have these two tabs these two views and basically what i want to do is i just want to take this 3d view and drag it away all right like so so now it's like a separate window that is not docked anywhere and then just taking it and dragging it to the side like so will eventually show me this right this blue rectangle once i see this blue rectangle i will release my mouse button and then this 3d view gets docked so now i'm working in two views at the same time or rather i see two views at the same time which is super convenient so let me just cut away that part so that's my box selection tool remember we are using it um and i'm using it to just cut away the bits that i don't need i'll maybe even cut deeper into into these surrounding buildings just so that i only see the my almost only see my building something like that okay so that is no no now that is not obscured okay so this is our entrance area uh which is which relates to this wall right here you can see once i select this wall here it will show up here get highlighted here as well and here i just want to add a door so how do you do that well you select the door tool uh well i zoomed in so now we wait there we go i click on the door tool and here before i start adding it it will ask me for what kind of door do i want so this is a single flush door 2.1 meters high 0.9 meters 90 centimeters wide this is like a typical typical door and actually there's not a lot of options here to choose from so i will be choosing the default you know the regular doorway i think that's that's absolutely fine i'll just add it do we center it probably just do it like that bam so i have just added the door and let's say um let's say i want a layer down the line i will want to add a shelf here or i will want to have a possibility to add a shelf here so we know that the shelf width is 60 centimeters so the way i do it is i will just let me just see if i can hello i'm i zoomed in too much again just give me a second give not me give right uh rabbit a second two to catch up there we go oh my god it's quite a quite a slow program ain't gonna lie not responding huh well that that calls for a coffee break zoom out there we go and i'll just click on modify here this modify button there we go i will select the door and now i can here this this dimension i can add i can write rather what kind of dimension i want instead of zero instead of the door being flush with this wall i can add 600 millimeters enter that is wrong minus 600 that is correct so the correct way as well of course and thus we now have this gap here where we will be able to put a shelf or you know a seating area anything like that usually i i do this for for a rack for clothes rack for the entrance so that's how you add a door that's that's basically it right you you just kind of do it you just add a door um another thing is adding a window so while we're still here in our entrance i i will be adding a window here in this area so it's done in a exactly same way as the door i'll select the window tool and i will choose what kind of window i want i think i'll just go for the default one because these guys have too many subdivisions i don't want that many subdivisions so i'll just use the regular one and i'll choose this the type of it so let's say that's 90 centimeters by 1.8 meters i think that's that's gonna be okay or let's do let's do 40 centimeters by 1.8 meters i think that's going to be cooler like that and here i can specify how high the window is going to be right so that's before me clicking on the wall i can specify how high this window can be or i can do that layer layer down the line that's fine as well so let me just put it in probably maybe closer to the door there we go something like that so i constantly check the dimensions to see if they are correct and 300 ml i think is fine so we end up with having the door and this kind of a narrow window inserted let me click on the modify tool again select the window and see what we can what we can change with it so the first thing is cell height and the second thing is head height right so in terms of cell height i can say well what if it's 500 millimeters hit apply see the window just moves up and then the head height updates as well so now let's say i want the window to be aligned the height the top of the window rather to be aligned with the door the way i do it is i will just select the door and just double check so the head height of the door is 2.134 meters so if i select the window and here for the head height i type in two one three four hit apply ah yes of course it gets aligned it does get aligned with the door but i forgot the how is that called the framing the framing of the door and i assume the framing of the door is like um that looks like five or maybe ten centimeters no that's definitely not 10. so that looks like a 5 centimeter framing so i will just add 5 centimeters to this head height which is going to be a total of 2184 millimeters and that looks right i think maybe not yeah we're one centimeter away two one nine four i could just yeah probably i should do this i could just kind of select the door right and go to edit type and find the trim extension here so apparently trim width is set to be 76 millimeters so i will just change it to 50. apply so now it is indeed 5 centimeters and now if i change this back to 2 1 8 4 apply there we go now they are aligned so it's a little bit fiddly uh edit type lets you edit the type of the door itself so you can make adjustments to how the door looks like same thing for the window um right so we have that done now uh nothing too fancy but you know it is it it it is working so that's good um and that's what we will visit that partly ah no never mind that's that's the surrounding building so that's not not an issue um so that's basically how you add doors and windows right nothing too fancy by the way if you want to change the type of a window once you have inserted it you can same thing for the door so you just select the window you go to prop you go to the properties tab and you just choose a different type right bam it changes and now we need to fish out which one yeah it was this one good um so that is that in terms of let me do it again for the for the other side just so that we are on the same page and everyone is following along or rather maybe i want this to be full glass right this whole area perhaps i want it to be full glass i can do that by first carving out a hole in the wall and then adding what's called the curtain curtain curtain wall inside of that opening so to do an opening to create an opening you can either create a vertical or a horizontal opening and the vertical opening is just called a wall opening nothing fancy and the horizontal one or rather maybe i should call this the vertical one so the shaft is a vertical opening while the wall opening is horizontal right so yeah again the the shaft is is you carve away from what's called floor slabs and ceilings and roofs with wall opening you carve away from the wall so i will just select that tool which will basically ask me to what does it ask me that's a rectangular opening in a straight uh or curved wall so for that i probably need to do it in 3d right or maybe we can do it in 2d let's see click no click yes okay so it's basically two clicks uh let me do that again because this was a a bit dodgy uh wall opening click click click there we go so you select the wall and you see then you say from where do you start opening and where do you end so here it's it's a little bit wonky um you can see how what kind of hole it made but we can make a bunch of adjustments uh later um that's that's going to be easy to do and that layer is now actually so let me click on modify and here you can see that i can select the opening the shaft i can indeed select it and i can change its measurements right so here i want a precise measurement of three meters let's see if that's gonna gonna work yeah it is gonna work and i want it to be centered right so that's 103 and that's 97 that doesn't work i'll just do 100 by 100 right so 3 meters 10 centimeters 10 centimeters so we have this this opening here and the height of it right i can change the height of it as well so first things first let's check the the bottom so the bottom here the base offset is minus 19.2 for some reason i don't want that i will just say base offset is zero hit apply so it gets moved up a bit and then the top offset so that is from the from the first floor level you can see that top constraint is said to be up to level 3500 right so it's it's from this level here um it's being moved down by one point uh one meter eight centimeters right which is a very weird offset so actually for for this kind of window i will say uh minus minus 500 ml i think that's that's going to be okay so it gets moved closer there we go so we have our our opening here which is ready to uh accept or or now we are ready to put in a curtain wall inside of it the way we do it is we just create a wall we start creating a wall and in the properties you scroll down until you see curtain wall option right and here there's like exterior glazing storefront curtain wall so we will just be creating a regular curtain wall like that um and we will say that wall goes along the center line that's fine yeah all of that seems okay let's just start drawing it and see what happens right so this is the default settings top constraint unconnected that's fine and let me just try and draw it through the middle point of this wall from here to here there we go okay so that is done um it's basically it just created a single glass panel right now and you can see that that panel doesn't even reach the top so we need to somehow be able to reach apologies we need to reach the top of this hole and the way we do it i believe is by just no we can't well technically we can by just saying that it needs to be up to the first floor level right but the top offset needs to be the same as the top offset of our hole which we used 500 millimeters for right so it goes up to level one uh and the top offset is minus 500 millimeters hit apply it didn't change why didn't it change that's because we are still in place wall tool and not edit wall tool that's my bad sorry about that so we actually need to escape out completely so hit escape until you don't have any tools running we need to do that and then we select this glazing wall how is it called curtain wall sorry this curtain wall we selected and then here we can change the settings so that was my bad before i was changing the settings for the next curtain wall that i'm going to be creating so top constraint from unconnected i changed this to first floor and top offset i changed this to minus 500 and now it should be good to go there we go so now it's all tied up okay so we have our uh single glass piece here which is not you know it's okay but it's it's maybe not something that we necessarily want perhaps we want to have a little bit more divisions and so on of course it is it possible to make it like that technically yes but this would cost more than the rest of the building so instead let's let's add a few divisions so i am going to escape out of all of the tools and here in the architecture tab i'll find curtain grid tool so this is going to be actually once i hover my mouse over it it shows what it does it's going to separate the glass panels into a smaller panel right with a grid so curtain grid select that and here in the plan view um i am just going to kind of divide it up and i'm thinking of um perhaps we can do one meter here and one meter here right so two divisions right every one meter like that and then in the let me jump in here in the perspective view i will say that at 2.2 meters i also need a division this kind of indicates that i will have the center piece as a doorway i'm able to use it as a doorway and the doorway is not going to be like three meters high which reduces the costs dramatically so once you're done that escape escape hit escape a bunch of times once you've done that you are able to um well you will see that the glass has been separated into parts but there is no framing yet so we need to add the frames and the way you add frames is by creating millions so frames are called millions right i will select that tool mullion like that and it's going to say uh first of all what kind of mullion do do we want right it's going to ask in the properties what kind of million do we want and there's like a bunch of different options 50 by 150 ml is is a pretty intense one i want a little bit thinner one so i'll just use the 30 millimeter square million so that's a cross section it's like three by three centimeters it's super thin it's unrealistically thin but i think that's fine can we add the type of it yeah we can even add a type and we can add any thickness we want but i will stick to to the default one that's that's fine so we have our mullions and then here it asks me to select grid lines right so i can either select grid lines one by one and these divisions are grid lines they are called grid lines i can select them one by one or i can select all of them at the same time so i'm thinking of just going to town and just selecting all of them and clicking so i just selected that tool and clicked on the gridlines and now uh the framing has been placed and you can see it here as well right those those black dots that's that's the framing perhaps um let me undo ctrl z and instead let me actually use the bigger one just so that you can see better uh these these divisions so again i selected the 50 by 150 mil all grid lines select bam big boys right okay so we have our curtain wall here set up you can do the same thing for multiple uh multiple floors as well that's that's fine um you just make a larger shaft actually maybe i should should show you how to do it um can do i show you here or here maybe here let's do a glass facade right in the front of the of the building so i will go to my sorry now i'm just starting to design it i'm trying to figure out a nice nice design for this um so let's say in our first floor ah that's the wrong wrong side and now we need to wait for it to load up so first floor load it up on the right hand side no i want it here so in our first floor i will also create a a shaft opening so sorry a wall opening like that and i will create one from uh on this wall from here to here something like that but this one actually i want to be a little bit less wide so i'll just say something like this perhaps so let's go for 1.5 meters that's 1.5 millimeters that's my bad i keep forgetting too that i'm drawing everything in millimeters here um usually in rhino i do block outs in mirrors and then switch to millimeters once i do a detailed project 1500 right and this dimension needs to be zero uh can't keep elements joined that's fine i will just say unjoin elements ah but then it makes that mistake huh so this is where it it starts becoming a little bit just your regular revit things right uh let me undo and here instead of zero oops here instead of in this case instead of 300 millimeters let me write 500 something like that so we have a 20 centimeter gap here i think that's fine um let me while i'm at it let me make another shaft here from here let's see can i type in 500 oh yes i can but it lags so this is another way of how i'm creating shaft so while i'm still in shaft creation tool i am able to kind of continue adding shafts to this but it's not being cooperative at all oh that's that's my bad so i forgot that i'm creating a wall opening and not a shaft so i accidentally cut away from the floors not from the wall oopsie control z uh disregard yes save the project sure okay we're back i'm ah sorry let me just create a wall opening not a shaft opening i will show you how to create a shaft opening in just a second but now we are just creating wall openings like that modify select this and here we just start typing in the dimensions so this one is going to be like 600 mil and it's going to be let's say or actually here this dimension is going to be 200 mil away something like that yeah i think that's gonna look okay and now it's just the height right i need to i i need to fix the height of it so i'm just going to select the first shaft opening and i'm going to say that the top constraint of it is up to the third floor like that and the top offset is um let's go for zero hit apply doesn't cut huh that's weird i wonder why perhaps it's because i made it in wait yeah that's understood that's because these are two separate walls right and this guy this shaft opening can only cut through the one so that but that's that's not a problem i will just move it down and i will say that the the constraint is the second floor top offset is zero apply hit apply same thing for this one not for this one or for this one top offset zero apply there we go and now we just need these two uh shaft openings to go to the second floor as well so i'm just going to do it manually real fast so let me jump to the second floor that's 20 that's 20 that's 60. don't remember this one but we'll figure it out uh should be good uh so let me just drag this one in here second floor there we go and i'll do this as fast as i can once this stops lagging while opening on this wall from here to here from here to here okay we have two wall openings this one is 200 mil this one is probably thousand five hundred um oh so that then it changes this 200 and this one i don't know i don't know this dimension but that's fine because we will get it by changing this so this one is 600 that is 200 and then automatically that dimension kind of locks in place in being 700 so now we have one more shaft that's great and all we need to do is just say that top offset of it is zero like that and that our top offset is zero as well apply uh why is this higher than oh this one is also that uh so sorry we need to move it down a bit because we are going into the floor slab so the floor slab is 150 millimeters wide or or thick so the top offset actually needs to be minus 150 apply so that we're not going into the floor slab um this one come on come on just let me there we go minus 150. okay so here we have our shaft openings and i'm just going to jump back into first floor where i'm just going to create the the curtain wall again wall architectural curtain wall from here to here and then from here to here right so we have our our walls modify um so sometimes it creates a wall inwards in inside like in in the wrong direction so the way you fix it is by you don't really see it on the screen but there are two arrows here which let you change the orientation of the wall right so you can switch them up so i'll do that i will switch the orientation of these walls uh then i just need to for the first one i just i will just go to top constraint and see that actually it's to the third floor not the second floor and the top offset is actually minus 150 due to the thickness of the floor slab same thing for here top offset minus 150 up to level three apply there we go so we have our two curtain walls set up now all i need to do is just just add a grid again to them um so here i'll just add one division one vertical division here i don't need to add any vertical divisions right and then i'll jump into 3d and just hovering my mouse over the vertical edge of the curtain the curtain wall i am able to add horizontal divisions so i'll probably add probably add a division here thousand five hundred year thousand five hundred and it doesn't really let me add 1500 here but this seems okay um and then same thing here a thousand five hundred thousand five hundred bam 1500 or 1425 that's fine so we have our grids set up and then i'll go to modify tab or to i'll click on the modify button i'll click on million and do the same thing you know rectangular million all grid lines i'll choose the button that says all grid lines and see that all of these need rectangular millions right and these also need rectangular moles so now all of this is kind of done it's kind of set up right we have our uh our facade done last thing that i want to do i will not be messing around with the back side back side would also probably i would add a curtain grid of some sort i will instead just add a doorway and a window here in the in the top so let me go to the let's go here let me go to the third floor come on load up there we go third floor bam bam bam still loading there we go door regular door just add it probably 600 ml again something like that so we have our door and then click on modify window add a window also like a narrow window um 300 millimeters away from the door like that what the hell was uh well it worked out so the window is slightly too low uh we will fix that by just adjusting the head height two one three five um for for this window is actually it needs to be to 185 that's what we remember from our previous insertion of of this window that's it right that's that's it we have um some sort of a facade it's not the greatest for sure but you know it's okay it's good enough to show you the the tools um so that is that now let's look at how can we add in door doors doorways inside of the building um not put doorways walls walls and stairs inside of the building so i'll go back to ground floor and i'll add a staircase first so that's the first thing that i'm going to do is add the staircase so this is going to be a little bit more tricky not not necessarily tricky but um i will go to the architecture tab and i'll choose stair here and here is the stair creation tool right so i am able to either create a straight staircase which is just straight up that and by the way given the height of each step and so on and the width of each step it automatically knows how long the staircase is going to be and here our um this is our settings right so right now desired number of steps is 19 so this is how many steps we want and actual thread depth is 25 so it's only 25 centimeters really maybe that's fine um i like doing 28 centimeters for for for the threads but this is a pretty small house so 25 is okay and then it automatically automatically calculates what's going to be the riser height so that's one point sorry that's 18 centimeters which is fine uh 18 is okay so usually it's 17.5 but again this is a small house so when we just do a regular straight staircase it's it's pretty straightforward right we just i can say run is location of the line is on the left hand side of the run and i can just oops not the left hand side right hand side run right from here to here bam that's it that's that's a staircase i can even show it to you here no i can't i need a section to be able to show you um can we do a section no we can't while we are while we are running the staircase the stair tool so let me open up the building a bit so that you can see better what what's going on so again stair cancel ground floor so notice how that menu popped up that was because i was in 3d view instead i will create a ground floor the staircase and ground floor view so then it won't even ask me any questions so it's there from here to ah run on the right from here to here bam just creates a staircase so there's no opening and so on but that's fine that's that's something that we will we will easily easily fix okay so that is a very simple staircase without any risers without sorry without any landings without anything like that so let me delete it and instead let's see other variations of the staircase that we can do we can do full step spiral so that's that was the straight staircase we can do a full step spiral which is basically just there we go here it fits right so it just generates a spiral staircase nothing nothing fancy about it um not really sure how how it can be used in this particular project because it eats up so much space but it is there then you have center and spiral uh which is basically you describe the center point you and then you describe the end point and you can do you know you you do the spiral staircase so it looks the same but if i were to repeat it and if i were to say um something like this and then repeat it again oh my god this is annoying ah let's just do it this way repeat it again and see something like this bam or fine oh my god i can't fit it properly so i'm struggling with it let's let's try it again uh that's going to be our center point and we will start from here half a turn like that and then this is going to be our center point we will start from here and another half a turn so it's going to make this kind of a this kind of a staircase which uh yep it is how it is it looks how it looks i know but um let me just delete it so that you don't need to look at it uh automatically whatever okay so then we have l form staircase which is quite quite convenient but it's basically just drag and drop and then once you drag it dragged and dropped it you will need to align it with with the walls of course so to align you can either rotate it so you select the tool or the thing and you rotate it like that right that's super super simple or or there is an option for aligning a line so it's going to ask you to give it a reference line so let's see this line and it's going to ask you to give it a alignment line so this line here let's see or that yeah there we go so first it's the alignment line and then there's the reference line and it's just going to snap to snap to place also kind of kind of useful uh especially in these kind of uh kind of houses because then you can um move through move below the the staircase so that might be something that you would like to look into um last one that i am going to cover is the ushape winder i guess uh so it's basically this kind of staircase right again it this one is just drag and drop and again i will just use align tool click click to just snap it to place easy um right so that's uh that's the staircases uh the default staircases rather so then you have the possibility to make your own uh well not make your own but draw your own staircase which i really enjoy so you can create runs landings and support systems which we don't care about so run is basically let's say i want my first run to be only two meters long and i want my second run to be let's take let's say it starts from here and goes um on the left hand side and goes until let's see only for a meter like that and then i have my third run which is on the right so you keep switching between left right level light to goes like so it's no problem it's going to do it right it's it's not going to be tricky at all uh it's going to automatically connect the staircases with the runs sometimes it doesn't so if it doesn't let's see if if there is a disconnect between this let me show you here in 3d as well if there is a disconnect between this run and this run right i can draw a landing either by hand or by specifying that yo please connect this this and this right so just click click and it will connect them with a run or if i want a fancy some sort of fancy shape for for my my landing then i can create a sketch create a sketch and then just draw it out so i will just say i want my landing to be a beautiful little form like this come on snap there we go bam just make sure that it's a closed uh holy line hit apply bam that's that's your that's your landing and right now it's not tied to your stairs so you would need to actually uh change the relative height of it so that it is indeed tied with with the steps so um you can do that by calculating um the the height of each step and kind of getting the the correct value for it i think like let's say 2500 here apply yeah that's close enough that's close enough so you end up with this kind of a weird run where it may it does make mistakes here uh it doesn't feel it fill it in or anything like that but it is a possibility let me delete that um yeah that's that's about it in in terms of stairs so let me just create a super simple one right now just a straight staircase um and here when i'm going to be creating it i'll just go through the go through the the settings and here i kind of want to do let's see what kind of monolithic staircase how does that look like yeah so i i do like the monolithic staircase type because it's super simple right it does exactly what i want it to do it's it's a super simple staircase so let's let's do it and i'll just do a straight line for it so let's see a person who walks in um hangs his or her coat and then is a staircase waiting for them uh on this side so i just want to give them like 1.5 let's say mirrors of space to move uh 1.5 there we go space to move uh along so so that there is like a there's no awkward awkward moments here uh the width of the staircase is one mirror um i can change it here if i want to but i think for something like this one meter is a okay there's no railing but you can add railing uh to the staircase um by just clicking this this button railing uh where you kind of choose what kind of type of railing you want um i don't know what's default let's see ma'am hello railing that's weird let me just accept this ah okay so it it did create railing once i have accepted the staircase so this kind of railing is super ugly and i don't like it so if if you don't want the railing you can always delete it straight up just delete it that fixes your your problem of not having a nice railing but now you have another problem which is people falling down your stairs so to fix it let's say uh i will just make a a wall here right for for the staircase i'll just make a wall i'll just put it in the wall the gallery owner needs a wall either way so might as well do it for them so i will create a wall and it's not going to be a curtain wall it's going to be an interior wall uh one three eight millimeter seems fine uh that's a partitioning wall and just create one here uh that is not going to be a center line i don't i can't have it as a center line finish face exterior probably nope i was wrong finish face interior like that so you always kind of mess around with the alignment alignment of the walls so i think that and then that should be a okay enter so we have this kind of a weird awkward interior wall here but we will fix it by just selecting it holding down the control key selecting both of them um and then just saying top constraint is up to the first floor and top offset is minus 150. the reason why it's minus 150 is because of the thickness of the floor slab okay great now we have now now we have some some walls here and i will probably just add architecture door just because i want to i'll just add a door here like that because you kind of want to use up the space below the the staircase for storage so we have that and that is uh good enough for or for paintings to hang and you kind of just you're you're not losing uh surface area for the gallery and that's that's the key i guess um okay so now one last thing just one last thing is that the staircases uh they don't go anywhere right once they reach the second floor they you just bump your head or the first floor you just bump your head uh we need to make a hole in the first floor to let the staircase in and to do that i will just go to first floor right here i can see that the staircase ends here that's perfect uh and i will create a shaft opening so i can either create a shaft opening or i can change the boundary of the floor itself let me show you both variations on how to do it so let's say the first variation is changing the boundary of the floor right so actually changing it in this section sometimes it's kind of hard to select the floor slab so i'll just do it in 3d view selecting the floor slab there and then continue working in the plan view so we are going to change the boundary of this floor slab so if i click on edit boundary right here i can draw lines so the pink line here is the boundary of our floor but if i let's say take a let's go for a circle circle tool and just draw out a circle right in the middle of the boundary and hit accept um this is what's going to happen right it's going to make a hole uh off of that circle so let me come back here or rather undo ctrl z um and ctrl z once more to undo the the circle and instead let me draw out the opening for the staircase so this is 3.5 meters right the ceiling height is 3.5 meters so that means if if we kind of climb up to the half of the stairs it's 1.75 meters of of clearance so that's not good that means we need um at least three more steps uh for for the clearance to be okay so that we don't bump our heads so i'm guessing if this is the middle if this line if it's the middle of the staircase i'm guessing up until here we need an opening so let me just and that's good that we have an arrow just kind of showing us that um so let me just grab a line tool and just draw one two three four five just kind of clicking five times to draw this rectangle hitting accept would you like walls that go up to this floor level to attach to its bottom would you like walls that go up to this floor's level to attach to its bottom nah don't attach don't don't don't care don't care um and yeah we have our opening now right with with our steps there is a little bit of a gap there why is there a gap there ah that's because of the discrepancy of of the riser height so it couldn't fit perfectly but oh or maybe it could no it could because this height is the same as this height okay so that's sorry that that was my bad it's all good it's all good so we have an opening for our staircase the problem now is you know and you kind of continue working on it the problem now is that you can fall down here right in the in the into this hole so we need to build up some some walls yeah sure save project always save your projects by the way so we need to build up some walls from here to here to maybe here just like that enter and then i'm just going to modify select these two walls holding down the control key and say that it's actually connected to the second floor and the top offset is again 150 apply perfect so now if i make a section through the stair steps steps i can see you know how exactly this whole thing works right so we're we're making progress right so we can access the first floor and now we have access to the to the second floor and then of course you would need to figure out a way of how to access the third floor and all of that good stuff it would probably be some sort of uh actually let me let me just show you just so that you uh get a sense of of how i'm i'm thinking when i'm doing these things so you arrive here right that's that's your arrival point in the second floor in the first floor sorry from the ground floor uh so that's your arrival point and then you choose to either go up again or to go into this space right so that means it makes sense uh to have a staircase winding around here right doing a ushaped wind here so i'll create a stair uh cast in place there moletics there that's perfect and i will give it a first run after one meter i'll give it the first run of four steps right here so there is like a gap right here then i will give it uh four more steps here fail to generate automatic landing layout that's fine we'll just move uh these steps away a little bit and it will generate the landing and then the rest is going to be generated here can't make stair stairs uh why cancel cool welcome to revit okay we try again steps this time um let's let's say only three steps here two three no uh a bit closer three steps here then four steps here and then the remaining ones are here can't make stairs why why are you complaining about this cancel okay let me do let me not snap to this edge here maybe it's it doesn't like it and instead snap to like align it with these steps here like that maybe that's yeah okay so that works uh just try until it works that's that's the answer um yeah and that is basically it then then i just hit accept like finish editing bam it creates these railings which we just get rid of like that and now we have our steps to the second floor and the second floor also doesn't have a hole in it right so we need to create a hole for or the second floor uh to do that i will actually show you the other way of how to do it with the shaft so i will go to my second floor that's great that's where the steps are and i will create a shaft opening so i clicked on the shaft option there and the shaft opening basically just asks me to draw a boundary line again so i'm just drawing a line probably something like that yeah let's yolo it something like that accept bam we have our opening and yep the shaft just ate up the floor above as well so we need to change uh the height of the shaft and the cool thing about is is that with the shaft tool you can just kind of go to 3d and just drag it down you know so that it doesn't reach the that floor and you're you're you're good to go so you just kind of drag down the top face of the shaft um that's it about and of course you would need to add the walls there and then so on and kind of mess around with the railing here uh perhaps i shouldn't have deleted the railing there but who cares um right so we covered walls we covered glazing curtain systems curtain panels we cover doors windows uh columns are boring um architectural column you can just kind of place a column anywhere you want bam there's a column for some reason there's two never mind there's only one so you can place columns but i don't think you will need any columns in this kind of a building you have ceilings we don't care about ceilings floors okay we have done all of this all of this grid is done super okay we are done with this part of the tutorial next time i will show you how to actually get drawings out you know it's going to be the final tutorial so everything that that i've missed i will show you how to do it um how do i say it get to work so to begin we have covered walls doors windows all of that good stuff and the only thing left is furniture and i'm not going to be detailing this this project to you know to its full potential so to say uh this is just for me to show you um the different components so it's not going to be in my case it's not going to be a finished project but for you as students i expect you to kind of do and do a full project um right so let's begin the thing is that with revit 2021 uh there are there isn't a lot of objects or a lot of furniture pieces that you can natively get into your project if i go here to component right if i click on this component icon i can see here that there are some desks that i can choose from there's a parking space some trees and that's basically it that that's basically it uh from from the default um like default library so it's not it's far from being a big library uh so how do you get more stuff in here um well there is this button here called load family if you press it it will open up a browser for you a file browser and from here you if you have an older version of revit you would be able to choose a furniture piece or or like you would be be able to navigate through the library of furniture pieces uh but here it's just structural precast and some some weird stuff so i don't have anything here so how do you get a library in revit 2021 how do you get a library in here well you need to go to let me first escape out of this tool there we go and you need to go to insert and click on load family and those of you who are working on the school's computers i will be able to i believe you will find the library already installed but those of you who are working from home this is what you need to do especially with the new revit click on get autodesk content right here which will open up you can see it there we go it will open up a browser page uh for you uh where you can get where you can download uh the the content so this is the the library of furniture and whatnot um and that kind of content is split into different regions so english united states english united kingdom and if we scroll down far far down you will see english sweden right and here there there are these uh uh swedish libraries which you can install but there are only 15 megabytes which tells me that there's not a lot of stuff in there right so instead what i'm going to do i'm going to actually download the english united states metric libraries which is 1.2 gigabytes right much larger so that means much more stuff for me to play with so i'll click on this and it will immediately start downloading if it doesn't you might need to sign in but it seems like i haven't signed in so it should be fine right so i'll wait for it to finish downloading uh install it and then we will take a look at how to get them into your file so just a second actually actually to save time while it's downloading i will be messing around with with the furniture here so with the furniture that i have so in architecture tab i'll click on the component tab and i'll see yeah sure this desk uh pretty ugly one but who cares basically adding a disk is just as easy as going to let's see the ground floor zooming in and hello oh right uh so if you change views it will it it will ask you to to run the command again so i'll click on component desk and here i just can click and place the desk uh okay so it's thinking let's hope it's not gonna crash it didn't so okay so we we have a desk in here and i can place another one if i want to whatever so i have two desks here if i check it in 3d view i can see those two desks being displayed here even being cut one of them is being cut so let me go back to the ground floor delete one of those desks and this one what can you do with it well you can move it around of course you can rotate it so that's the rotate button right here right so from here to here you can rotate it let me undo that and you can align it as well so this desk i will click on the alignment tool choose let's see this wall here this disk line here and it's going to snap in place it's going to be aligned so that means now i can kind of move it okay let me escape out there we go now i can move it and place it properly on my inside of my building uh let's see it in 3d yeah that's how it is um if you don't see a line here um just like i don't uh that means your desk is clipping into it's it's being pushed into the wall a little bit that's fine what we can do is in ground floor we just move it slightly away from the wall one just slightly there we go 10 centimeters that's maybe a little bit too much i zoomed in too far so now we need to wait for it to do its thing i don't know what it's doing but yeah there we go so here now once i selected it i can see the dimension here saying a hundred millimeters i can change this to 50 right so it's only five centimeters away from the wall perfect if i go to 3d view i can now see that that line is present oh that's an ugly desk let me just delete it okay is it done yet yes it is okay so once you have downloaded the exe file i'll just run it so it's opening it up revit is famous for being super slow and installing stuff but it seems to be doing the trick let me hit extract and it should be yeah it's fine so it's now it's extracting all of the material that i have downloaded uh taking super long but come on come on not not the best thing for for a tutorial to wait for things to extract but who cares it's just like 15 seconds 20 seconds a minute maybe perfect time for a coffee break um while it's extracting actually it should be already loading in the the files and let me just make sure 2021 autodesk folder okay so it should be extracting into the correct folder so let me jump back to ground floor go to architecture tab component and click on load family here and let me find english not english imperial but english oh yeah there we go so there's now a lot of folders in here which is great and they are being some files could not be created please close all applications or between this and restart this installation yeah sure so basically what it's saying is you shouldn't be running you shouldn't be loading in the libraries while you are extracting the libraries we don't care we have quite a few already installed this is going to be enough to get the point across so let me repeat that step just to make sure that you all follow i clicked on components icon and then clicked on load family and here i'm in english imperial library so i just moved up one folder and found my english regular english folder which is metric and here we have different kinds of windows for instance you know new kinds of windows that you didn't see before and also we have furniture furniture there we go furniture system or furniture so let me jump to furniture let me see what kind of tables it has so once i click on one i can see the uh a preview of it so round rectangular um still not that great but a bit a little bit better than what we had before so for instance this round table i'll hit open and nothing happens oh never mind it all immediately loads it in and now i can place it right so once i've pasted it and let me escape out of out of everything and even delete this this table altogether if now i go to components tab i can see that now this table with all of this variations is loaded in to the project right so now i can use it anytime i want right just choose it and place it okay so just i mean on your own time you can investigate what kind of stuff there is and what kind of families you can load in but it's mostly tables beds um right different kinds of beds seating right different kinds of chairs even carbs just here right that and then if we take a closer look to to all of the folders in the library we can see that there's even curtain wall panels different types of curtain wall panels different types of columns different types of different stuff so one thing that i'm interested in is windows for instance because before we had to work with pretty default you know pretty regular windows so if i escape out if i have let's say let me look at the 3d model where could i add a window by the way this is this is complete garbage you can't access this area right here so my staircase is completely like nonsense uh it's it's it's a bad staircase i should probably fix it yeah for pedagogical purposes i will be fixing the staircase sorry i can't can't have that in the tutorial so that's uh my first floor let me jump in there uh this staircase blocks off entrance to the to the balcony so i'll just delete it and instead let me just quickly stare there we go let me just from here to here four steps that's perfect and then from here to here all remaining steps that's uh can't make stairs that's cool uh let me try again escape or not escape just create a landing um let's say from here to here there we go now it's fine um i'll hit accept i'll probably change the oh no it is a monolithic run but it does have the um much more call it the the the railing so let me jump to a 3d view get rid of the railing that it's not in the way um i would need to fix a bunch of stuff here but that that is okay um or maybe we keep the railing well either way first floor there's enough of a gap for here to to walk through that's fine and now we have a gap here to actually access the balcony i believe in the second floor we need to yeah on the second floor we actually need um an opening here so uh to to access to be able to access the second floor now from the staircase so i will be either adding a new shaft opening or maybe in this case i will change i will delete the shaft opening altogether and i will change the the boundary of the floor slab here so to do that let in in 3d view let me just select the the floor slab oop this one the floor slab in question uh let me go to the first floor uh nope that's in the second floor there we go and let me click on edit boundary right here wait for it to figure it figure out what i want and here i will just draw a few lines so from here to here and i think up until here should be enough so that's going to be my opening which means that this line and this line like this line segment and this line segment shouldn't be there so i will be uh using either uh no wait pick walls is bad just a second oh there we go i will be using trim extend to corner uh tool right here so i'll select this line first and then this line so now they get like trimmed together and then this line and this line and also they get trimmed together i'll hit accept would you like walls to go i don't attach don't care now i have a proper opening in 3d view if i take a look at it and this is how it looks i think that's fine so now we can move up and we actually do have a possibility for an entrance which i am going to create so let's continue uh let's jump into second floor oh wait no sorry first floor let's jump into first floor and add the door here so to add the door you click on the door tool and actually why don't we find a different kind of a door i assume the library that we downloaded should contain different doors so load family go up from the tables from furniture and let's see dddd stands for doors doors there we go doors double click oh that's a lot of doors um curtain wall double glass door that's nice it's a simple one single panel door commercial doors and nothing too too nice here maybe we can just do curtain wall single glass you know regular doorway only that is in glass hit open it gets loaded in some of all of the families cannot be loaded what that's weird i am in the doors doors family okay you must choose family files of the category doors do you want to re retry loading a new set of oh right okay so this is this is important this is important so notice how the name says m door curtain wall single glass curtain wall is the key thing here so that means that this door belongs to a system of a curtain wall rather than a door system um remember back in the previous tutorial i did a curtain wall so this is a way of how you can add a door into the curtain wall so this family uh doesn't doesn't work so instead we need like a regular door like that um let's just find one that's good enough so all of these are curtain wall doors right um double no no i shouldn't be picky yeah sure panel would yeah whatever i'll just use that one it's it's not the prettiest but it will do i'll hit open now it it actually works i hit ok sure save the project whatever and now i'm able to add that particular door and it even has different types here for me to choose from right so i'll choose the let's say 2.1 meters by 80 centimeters something like that opens up outwards like that that's it so we have our door uh inserted right if i take a look at it in 3d that's not the door that i want so i will just simply select it scroll down here oh and and just choose the interior single four panel wooden door type right so i just switched the door type so now we're gucci um let's jump to first floor and add the window just like we added the door and let's add a super ugly window so let me go to the window tool load family jump back find windows there we go and let me just find a weird one oh my god this is a no um let's just find a regular one so it's it's the types of windows just like doors it's not like you can add any type of window to any type of geometry uh you will need to fiddle a little bit with it until you you become comfortable i will add oh perfect yeah that that's excellent that's that's exactly the window that i wanted to add i'll hit open it's going to load it in and now i can just add it i'll just add it in here bam like that let me check it in 3d view that's that's how it looks like i believe i will change the sill height to a little bit higher to to be a little bit higher so i'll just change it to 1 meter 200 millimeters yeah yeah sounds about right or rather looks about right horrible anyway so that's how you add uh custom custom stuff to your your geometries uh last thing that i'm going to do since this is a gallery i should probably add wind not windows i should probably add like paintings and stuff uh so i will family load in family and where could i find paintings plumbing profiles railings furniture probably furniture right yeah probably furniture so furniture that's mirror beds storage tables there's no painting here huh oh my god so it's going to take me a while to to find it but we can find we can use a cabinet like shelving and place it there at least so i'll do that instead i know for a fact that there are paintings here uh in in this library it's just that finding them you know since i don't do it that often i don't remember where they are so instead i'll add a shelf there um i really hope that i can change the width of the shelf we will see um i'll hit open and probably need to do that in the ground floor right yeah like that and i will add i'll be adding a shelf right here so first let me place it escape there we go so now it's placed and let's see if we can edit type and yeah super so we can edit the the the shelf width and height and so on that that's that's great that's what we want um so let's make it proper i will grab the 3d view like that and i will dock it to the side like that perfect just so that i can constantly see you know the the shelf itself and there's my shelf just standing there so what i want to do is i want to make a different kind of section so let me move this section plane right here and instead let me move this section plane inwards even more uh maybe that's a little bit too much a little bit out oops that's the wrong one bam okay that's good so now we see our shelf just standing there i will align it so i will select it click on the align tool from to this edge from this edge just line it like that and we have our shelf i'll click on modify select it and now we can actually add a type and let's just hope that it it works right so depth of the shelf uh let's say 500 millimeters let apply okay that that works i will move it to to the correct position just in a second height so i know that the height between the floors the the the ground floor is 3.5 meters minus the floor slab so it's actually two eight five zero millimeters that's the height of the shelf it apply there we go that's good that's good and for width let's do a three meter shelf apply maybe that's a bit too much let's do a two meter shelf yeah that's that's good enough uh and then i will just simply reposition it and snap it in place and now i have a shelf here right to put some stuff in um right so that's how you add furniture uh pretty pretty simple now once once you've done that once you've added uh added furniture added all of the cool stuff that you want to have in your in your building it's around time that we actually start working with the graphics and extracting nice graphics from your 3d model right so how do we how do we go about it well first of all i want to i want to make sure that every view that i have actually has a proper um proper depth if that makes sense so i will be going through actually now i don't need 3d view anymore uh i will be going through every gra every floor and just checking if the depth is proper so here that seems fine that's our ground floor first floor we see the balcony and that seems fine second floor seems okay third floor wait second floor should see the balcony here right on on the on the second floor and we don't so if if that happens uh what you do is without having anything selected you go here on the left hand side and you find view range option view range and you click on edit that view range and here you will you will have this popup where you can change uh how deep do you see from that particular floor and it's also at what height do you cut but i don't change that uh so level i will just say i want to see all the way down to ground floor hit apply hit okay and now we see the balcony same thing for the third floor um where is it view range up to the ground floor apply okay there we go fourth floor floor actually does have oh wait we don't need four floor fourth floor is going to be our roof uh so we don't care about the fourth floor all right so we have all of the views done uh like that that we need and now it's all about filling in right all about making hatches creating hatches and one thing that i would probably do before before making it pretty or making it nicer i guess i will go to sheets here remember in rhino you have layouts so here layouts are called sheets and i will create create a sheet for every view that i'm going to have so i will right click on the sheets and choose new sheet click there and you can see that it asks me for a title block and by default it's set to a1 metric and no we will be using a3 and we don't have one right but you're in luck because i have created one for you to use so on the course website uh lth digitalwordpress.com 15 scroll scroll scroll scroll you can download layout sheet template in revit family format this one right here or if this one doesn't work for you then you will be able to download the old version where you will need to change the the title but that's easy an easy fix so you download this one just download there we go have it here paste it here oh i already have had it here um and i will now load it in once it's downloaded i'll click on load i'll go to desktop and i have my aada15 sheet here hit open hit okay there it is right so now if i expand it i can see that it's a0101 unnamed sheet that's fine we will be naming them in just a second so how do you get a drawing into the sheet well you do that by just for instance ground floor by just clicking and dragging in the drawing into the sheet click drag bam uh where is it oh yeah it's going to ask you for position click again there it is now it's inside of the sheet good enough good enough for now um i wonder if we can get rid of the ground floor title block i'll need to investigate so here in in in this particular view you are able to kind of either crop the view or uh change the visuals of this particular view uh i know that that's a not a tongue twister but just my brain is slow today basically you can adjust the graphics of this particular drawing in just to be in this sheet first things first since i have a title block i don't need this this title right here ground floor 1 to 100 with numeration so i will select it and i will actually i believe it's in edit type right yes so once you select it you go to edit type right like right here and you untick show extension line and you where it says show title you say no and that should be yeah that should be that so now it's done hit okay you're good with that now for this particular view it's too big right it doesn't fit in your in your drawing so what do you do well here on once you have selected it on the left hand side you can find a tab called extends and a tick mark box called or check box called crop view if you select crop view and also if you select crop region visible you'll be able to to crop to crop the view yeah for the lack of a better word so let's see how how that how that works i don't think you can crop the view in the sheet which which is which kind of sucks but once you have those two tick marks and you go back to your ground floor view this rectangle will appear and then here in your ground floor plan you're able you you will be able to move this box that the sides of this box around until everything kind of fits nicely and then if you look at your sheet again this is how it looks right so i can see that i need to crop it even further so actually i'll just go to ground floor again and crop it even further perhaps there is a better way of doing it but i don't know uh i i always used this this method and it seems to work so yeah you end up with having this this kind of a view and this is 1 to 100 scale right uh this particular view is at the scale of one to a hundred how do i know well when i select the view and i scroll up here i can see view scale is one to a hundred if i change this to one to five hundred hit apply uh it's right here right so that's now one to five hundred you can see that the axes don't scale uh which is it's natural it they don't they shouldn't scale uh with the view there we go so we have our ground floor plan placed in inside of a sheet that's great and now there's just a few more things to fix here before we move on to our other plans so drawing name i wonder why is this not okay so how do you change things here drawing scale of course you don't need to change it's already kind of reading what kind of a scale you were working in but for instance drawing name and author's information you do need to insert right so for drawing name i will just click once and click once more it's not a double click if you double click it it's bad so it's click and then click again um and i'll just say ground floor plan plus 0.000 right it should be plus minus but i don't care um and then for uh for the for my own name it's just there we go my own name um that's it right and you can see that the sheets automatically update the name here pops up ground floor plan plus 0.000 altitude okay so now we need to repeat this for every floor for every section and for every elevation and the 3d view as well um i will do this a few more times and i will do this faster just so that you can kind of see the process a few more times and then kind of hopefully it will help you troubleshoot so let's begin so i'll create a new sheet uh it's already present here since i loaded it in like that i will drag in first floor bam like that i will position it like that i will go to my first floor and here i'll scroll down check mark crop view crop region visible i'll crop it to barely fit like that great so that's now cropped i'll jump back to my sheet that's going to fit properly i'll just position it drawing name i will change the drawing name to first floor plan plus 3.5000 or five zero zero um my name is there it remembers that's good yeah that's done all right then let's do one for a section and one for elevation and one for 3d so i will create so that's going to be for section new sheet that's going to be for elevation new sheet that's going to be for 3d all right so let me grab um i don't care which section section one sure i'll just grab section one here place it uh that's fine i'll grab for for this sheet i will grab elevation uh let's go for street elevation edit bam that's done and for this sheet i will grab the 3d view wait uh no that's the section that's the elevation okay sure this one is going to be the 3d view bam click okay so there's a bunch of stuff that i'll need to fix in all three of them so first off um elevation there's uh you [Laughter] you you uh quite quite a few uh quite a few ugly bits but i think we will manage so let me first position it something like that seems to be okay let me check the street elevation um i will just actually drag this uh to be wider so our street elevation already has this uh all of this incorporated that this cropping box which is super great um and let me just drag these out i can't drag them more huh so they get locked for some reason that's fine um and let me oh my god come on just just let me i just want to select there we go okay i managed to select the the last mark and for some reason other marks just disappeared i don't know why that's super weird it shouldn't happen so we try it again yay can we unlock this so this lock means that oh understood okay so these locks mean that if i move uh for instance this um single sheet here see how all others move that's because they are locked together right so that that's what this lock means it's actually a pretty useful thing so the reason why the those disappeared was because once i select this zoomed into too close now it's calculating if i select this bottom markup i can see that it's locked with the dashed line i can see that it's actually locked to the ends of all other floors and i don't want that so what i'm going to do is actually instead of unlocking it i will tick mark here to have it on both sides i will tick mark untick here you barely can see it it's it's right here that that rectangle i will untick here to to hide that side and now i will indeed move the side out so that it fits properly here once everything is aligned i believe all of them get locked together which is absolutely fine this one is a little bit out of bounds so let me just move it back in so this is how it looks let me check check it in 3d not in 3d in the sheet it seems to be fitting quite properly the section plane the section line is a little bit out of bounds so let me fix that street elevation you are way too close or way too far be here and also i don't want this line running through the middle of my drawing so i'll just move it like so like that and like that perfect okay so that is done and maybe even i will get the cropping rectangle and i'll move it slightly in like that just to clean it up a bit um yeah let's see let's see let's see how it looks this is how it looks i think that's okay not great not terrible just okay um but i think this is this is something that we can continue on working with so that's our facade um let me rename this street assad yep let me jump into this section and actually immediately i'll rename this section to section aaa like that notice how the section is uh filled in uh while the all other drawings are not that's because if i take a look at the section um and i believe it's section one right it is filled in here and this is just the graphics settings right so i can change this to hidden line and now it's not filled in and if i now take a look at it in the sheet i keep wanting to say uh i now forgot the other one i keep wanting to see layout rather than sheet um now it's not filled right so it's it's graphic settings that you want to change if if there's a fill and you don't want to see a fill so that's our section nothing very fancy happening here and it's actually pretty damn close to being fine let me see if i can add more stuff if i can see more stuff within this section okay so there's the surrounding building right there and can i see the one on the other side of the street yes i can so i will just do something like this just to get the section of the street and the the section of the next door building um jump back to section aa this is how it looks almost fits i say i'd say i'd say almost fits um do we just do it like that ah come on by the way you can use arrow keys to kind of move it around so yeah okay good it fits the dashed lines go out of bounds but we don't care about those dashed lines so that's fine and the section line as always is super obnoxious and i will be fixing it map and just move that one in here uh until here clipping plane up like that flipping plane come on come on just give me give me give me like that there we go okay so that is done that's our section a a uh for now and then the last one is the 3d view which we will kind of revisit in just a second right now it's still well actually let's let's uh let's let's make it nice so that's in 3d i will just move my clipping box here that's fine i think that's something like that is kind of kind of neat let's see if we can add some more bizarres here that's nice i think that that that looks okay um let's see uh is it possible for me to hide this in this view i believe it is if i delete it yeah it's going to um to delete the floor plans as well which i don't want to do at all so instead i will figure out a way of how to hide it which is i believe this button right here hide in view hide category or hide elements hide elements there we go let's see if it actually translates to our 3d sheet here it does okay great so let us hide a bunch of stuff in in this 3d view so that it's not obnoxious um with information so that all of that actually hide in view hide elements okay that's good can i hide this yes i can super okay so these are hidden the shadows are a bit funky but that that's okay this is how it looks uh let's take a look at it in 3d yeah sure not 3d sorry in the sheet bam that looks actually good that that looks fine i'll just place it here my graphics card is crying a bit but that's that's normal um and yeah let's just name it um 3d exonometric 3d axonometric uh drawing scale there is no scale for an axonometric drawing so of course it's going to be empty okay that is done right that is that is okay that's done we are ready to move forward and the next thing that we're going to do is drink some coffee delicious and jump to our ground floor plan the sheet of ground floor plan and we will change the display settings here for this sheet so for instance let's start with a simple super simple example i want the walls here to be filled in black right so how do i do that well the thing is that in revit everything that you do um every geometry belongs to a certain category as i mentioned before and all of that geometry is going to be it within that category category is going to be shown in a certain way once you just look at it and once you look at a cut of it right so how do you change it how do you change the the visuals well you go to the view tab here in the top and you choose visibility and graphics so these are visibility and graphics settings right for that particular view in this case this sheet right here visibility and graphics and here it's a pretty big table where you can change different different aspects of your of your graphics right so basically how do you show air terminals how do you show areas how do you show ceilings how do you show columns and and so on all of that is being treated by this table um one important one important note is that you have two big sides here not sides two big columns here one is projection surface this is where you just look at the element and the other one is cut which means how would it show you a section of that particular element so in case of maybe that's the fastest way to do it is just to show you with wall so i just scroll down to walls and i will say when i cut the walls the lines of the cut so i'll click on override here the lines of the cut should be solid should have red color and should be pretty damn thick maybe even thicker let's go for 16 who cares hit ok hit apply and nothing changes how come is it because i'm in the sheet sorry technical difficulties please please hold visibility on graphics walls solid red 16 okay apply ah okay apparently you need to change it not in the sheet but rather in the um in the floor plan itself and then it should show up yeah then it's going to show up in the sheet so as you can see 16 is a little bit thick uh let's jump back and let's actually jump back to ground floor plan and actually change the the graphics here so i will click on visibility graphics and go back to walls and actually i do want my wall cut to be solid a solid line but it should be black and the weight should be less like five or something yeah that that seems good right so so we end up with these these this kind of cut and then for the pattern i will say overwrite and you you have the possibility to have two patterns but i would strongly suggest you not having two patterns you know one laid on top of the other foreground background instead just work with the background pattern for now so for pattern i will also see solid fill and i'll say yeah again black hit okay hit apply that's that's that right so what else can we change here in in the plan uh plan view well the surrounding buildings and the surrounding uh uh street and so on uh all of them are white and actually i wanted to kind of change not to change to differentiate between the inside of this building and everything else the outside so remember right at the start of the course we have imported the surrounding geometry the site 3d model as a generic model so now i will find this generic model type here generic models right here and i will say that when we cut the generic models it should still have a pretty thick solid line right so solid line black color weight again five oh yeah hit apply forgot so now it it kind of gives us a bolder line where it cuts and then for patterns uh for the cut pattern i will say it should be a solid fill but the color shouldn't be black because that's going to be way too dark rather let's just say yeah gray hit ok hit apply so now everything that is being cut outside of the building is going to have this kind of gray color what about everything that's outside of the building that's not being cut i want it to be light gray right so then i will go to the projection part of it and i'll find patterns generic models patterns and here i will say for background let's use a solid fill but let's use a super super light gray color hit ok ok apply there we go hit ok here so now we have this this graphics uh graphics settings done for this particular view if i look at it in my sheets i can see that it's it's there if i were to add more more walls here right they don't get filled in what oh my god come on come on rabbit is that because it's a basic wall no it shouldn't be right right that's super strange okay let's see why it's not it's not working uh let's go to view visibility and graphics this this really feels like a bug but maybe i'm wrong but i haven't seen this happen before at all but i guess it's it's nice to from time to time see i see these things happen so let me change the color to red apply it's thinking will it crack okay it doesn't crash but it's not filling it in okay we will need to revisit that part later and then figure out why the hell is that happening um if this happens just try closing and opening rhino again that's probably going to solve it oh i know i'm dumb um this wall right here this wall it its height is 1.1 meters which means it doesn't reach the section through which we cut which means we are actually not cutting through these walls but right cancel we're not cutting through these walls but rather we are just looking at the top of these walls right uh probably in the section one is going to be a little bit more clear no it's not in section two yeah there we go so in section two you can actually see these walls here all right so we are not cutting through them at that height this is why it's not filling in but if i select them and i change the unconnected height of them to let's see two meters hit apply now they're being cut okay so that was can't make a perfect tutorial um always something there's always something wrong okay that's done let's jump into first floor and see that oh crap first floor also requires us to do exactly the same thing as we did for the ground floor so then the question is is it possible to somehow save these settings these graphics settings and apply them to all other floors and yes the answer is of course yes the of course i will just go to visibility graphics right here and i will or wait no sorry sorry not visibility graphics cancel cancel that uh in ground floor i will go to view templates here and i will say create template from current view and i will name this kinda good floor plan style hit okay it's going to save it hit ok again and now in the first floor i can go to view templates again and choose apply template properties to current view and then i will find my kind of good floor plan style apply properties and hit ok and now my first floor also has the same view second floor view templates apply kind of good okay third floor three templates apply kind of good okay so that's done now the question is can we do this for a 3d view for instance no maybe not can we do this for section right because section is basically just a vertical plan right or a plan is a horizontal section whatever you want to call it so can we apply the same view template here if i go to view templates apply and i choose apply template properties from view you might not see uh the that our template here that's because uh there's a filter applied which only is looking for templates which are uh which work with sections elevations and whatnot so i will expand this and i will just say all and i'll then find my kind of good floor plan style hit apply hit okay still works but the problem with this one is that it's still i still need more to to to change more styles here because for instance floor slabs they are not being cut and also i kind of want to cut through the through the doorway so let me move that section as well so in the ground floor plan i will just take the section and i will move it so that it cuts there we go so that it cuts through the the staircase and also the doorway in the first floor let's look at section two no section one there we go so now we are cutting through the the stair which is not being hatched in properly and we are cutting through the the floor slabs which are not being hashed in properly uh if we had a roof that also wouldn't be hatched in properly so we need to fix a few things let me go to visibility and graphics settings find stairs stairs there we go cut line override solid line black color weight also five that seems to be working for us quite well for patterns override background solid fill black apply there we go our staircase is now black and floor slabs ffff floors not floor slabs just floors pattern is going to be black and solid and lines are going to be solid black weight five apply okay this is what we have right nothing too fancy but it does the trick okay so we have that going on and that's our section and if we take a look at our section in here or actually maybe we should fill in nah nah let's not uh so let's see where is our section section aa there we go here it is all all ready to be plotted out um facade actually i kind of like the style of the facade here i don't really want to change anything the only thing that i kind of want to do is add shadows to the facade so i will go to my street elevation right here and here in the bottom i will choose shadows to be turned on like that and maybe i'll click on the small sun icon send settings and i will just mess around with the sun so can i just do still still hit apply let me change the location to not boston not no not not boston definitely not boston um i think we have denmark there uh copenhagen at least will will you give me copenhagen or will you give me malmo yeah it doesn't give us malmo whatever let's lie if you can't find the city just lie we'll just choose lighting and here we will just change the altitude and azimuth so perhaps i want it to be a little bit lower so 30 degrees apply yeah that's that's a bit better and asim of 115 so it eats up a little bit more yeah i think that's that's about it or maybe uh what if it's 45 degrees with that seam as a move so it does that this is hole in the shadow this is kinda doing his thing yeah i think that's fine i think that's fine that's okay and for the actual style i want the building my building to be kind of popping out a little bit more so i will push all surrounding buildings a little bit backwards with a gray color basically so visibility and graphics generic models patterns uh no that's a cut pattern we are not cutting anything so projection surface patterns color light gray solid fill apply there we go and maybe even generic models lines i will say solid line and kinda not not black but dark gray color with kind of low weight so weight of one so though the line work is a little bit uh thinner and a little bit more towards uh gray um even more gray please i know it doesn't really matter that much but i really wanna i'm gonna make it as nice as possible yeah that's great enough okay we have that done we have our building popping up popping out um and that is good so let me just double check street facade looks like that that looks like that axo actually i will not well maybe in the axle also visibility and graphics uh generic models lines solid gray thin line patterns up patterns uh pattern solid light gray okay apply okay yo did i mess mess up generic models parents it should work okay what about the cut what if i change the cut here solid fill solid fill color red okay so apparently oh that's my bad i i i can hear you screaming at the at the screen uh i am working in the sheet and not in the actual 3d view that's my bad as per usual oh my god so let's do it here [Laughter] generic models patterns light gray solid fill generic models pattern solid color dark gray weight very low apply perfect section could be no let's keep section as it is just hit ok right so that our our building kind of pops up a bit more okay we have that going on um right so that's about it that's about it in terms of our our graphics i think it's turning out to be okay students tend to ask me about the lines how to change the style of the grid lines because the style is pretty pretty obnoxious uh and the the way you do it is you download a nicer style and actually could we so to load in a section um a new section markup for instance you go to load family and here it's it's going to be under english annotations by the way if if you can't find the folder of the library let's say you're you're in the desktop uh it's located in this pc c disk drive program data which is a hidden folder if you don't know how to see all hidden folders you need to actually go to any folder that you have on your desktop or on your computer you go to view tab click on options you go to view tab again in the options and you choose show hidden files folders and drives hit apply hit ok and then you will see the program data folder and here you see autodesk uh rvt2021 libraries finally we are here they are really hiding it from us it's under english and i believe it should be under annotations right because where else could it be yeah it's yes it should be under annotations um grid level section section head there we go section head and here we see different types of section heads and all of them are complete garbage not garbage but uh really disgusting so it is what it is you're stuck with ugly section heads in in revit unless you download one from the internet that's that's nice um in terms of editing the section head itself zoomed in to close again in in in case of editing the section itself i believe um if you select it if you select it there we go you can change with that in the type cloud tag jesus christ that's a lot of you know what let's not dig too deep in into here just have a freaking section in there and yeah you just have a freaking section in there and then call it a day that's that's fine that you don't need to to have it too too intense um right what else is there to to show you oh that's it uh let's let's plot it out uh let's plot everything out so you have your sheets ready let's see i have a few of them yeah sure save the project always save the project by the way um i have a few ready here and it's time to print out or plot out your sheets into pdf so i'll go to file print or is it export no it's print file print print or just click on this print button here that's that works as well where here we have all of the different different settings uh that you can use for for plotting out the the sheets so first things first printer we will choose adobe pdf or microsoft print to pdf i think that one works as well anything that has the pdf word in it should work so adobe pdf for me kind combine multiple selected view sheets into a single file so do we want it in a single file yeah sure whatever print range uh we will not use current view instead we will use selected views selected views sheets and i will click on the select button and i will say i want to print out this this this this this these sheets right not the floor plans not the structural plans just the sheets i'll hit okay do you want to save these settings for use in the future revit session sure yeah sure so that's going to be my set one apparently my the name and the location of where i'm going to be exporting the pdf is uh weird so i'll just be exporting it to desktop so i'll just choose desktop hit save yeah perfect and the name of the file well right now it doesn't matter because i'm going to be messing around with it in photoshop so that's that's okay um right let's see these two buttons here properties as well as the setup so properties if i click on that i can see here nothing fancy nothing special paper source whatever layout landscape if i click on the advanced i can see that the paper size is said to be letter rather than a3 that's a nice way of hiding it let me just see if okay so we don't need to go to properties here sorry about that you just go to settings setup and here we can actually change it from the the letter size to the proper a3 size so we are working these sheets are tailored for a3 its landscape format is going to be centered sure and the zoom is going to be 100 so it's not fit to page it's rather zoom 100 uh vector processing sure raster quality high colors color oh yeah you can choose either color or grayscale we'll just use color that's fine um everything else is fine seems to be okay so i'll just hit ok and i'll hit ok again you have chosen to print five views as separate files do i want to yes i do want them as separate files because i'm going to photoshop them so i'll hit yes um right let me just create a new folder just so that it's easy for me to find raw pdf pdfs raw pdfs hit save it's doing its magic saving it while it's doing it i'll open up photoshop real fast by now you should be able to kind of wait just a second uh there revit save so you will need to click save for every sheet that's not a problem um by now you should be able to uh to to work with with pdfs uh in photoshop easily um that that's my expectation because we have been doing doing it for the past four courses now or three with three or four four past four courses no this is the fourth one right anyway we've been doing it quite quite a lot so you should be able to add textures and change colors and and whatnot in photoshop of your drawings hopefully don't show me this again close uh so that's that so i will just be really quick in showing you this last bit save that and i think that's that's the last of it right yes okay so let me save this file in photoshop i will just find my folder with all of the pdfs i'll just kind of drag all of them in and just choose what which which one i want to work with and show you show you how i'm going to work with it so crop 2 not bounding box never bounding box media box you always when you import pdf you choose media box so that it doesn't mess up your a3 size other than that it seems fine okay uh media box yes that's good so it remembers at least it remembers that's good okay okay okay okay okay so we have our section we have our uh elevation we have our axo floor plan floor plan so floor plans are kind of boring i will just close them immediately won't photoshop anything there um i could work here maybe on this one i don't know i i like how clean it is let's work on the elevation instead so section also goes away sure let me just show you how i would work on it with uh on the elevation so let's say i want uh some sort of pattern here i i don't know some some form of pattern let's say metal or something like that i'll just go to the interwebs i'll go to google and i'll say what's a cool pattern metal metal sheet pattern corrugated steel or something like that um perforated diamond that's that's whatever are there any good ones licensable no yeah that's good enough right uh i will just open it in a new window i know it has the watermark this is for a tutorial so we don't care uh so i'll just position it i will cut away the part that i need copy paste um so there's one unnecessary layer that i delete um i will say do we multiply oops that's the wrong one that's the actual drawing do we multiply the the texture yeah we do we probably do but before we do that let me try to get rid of the watermark by going to levels and messing around with with the levels yeah that seems okay that seems good enough uh make it smaller like that that's perfect ctrl a ctrl c ctrl v to duplicate it maybe ctrl t right clicking and flip vertical to kind of have a much more call it uh a seamless connection between between the two textures i will just merge these two layers together merge layers place them here ctrl c ctrl v again merge the layers again ctrl a ctrl c ctrl v again but this one ctrl t and right click flip horizontal so that they did emerge more nicely merge layers now i will jump to multiply that seems okay maybe make it a bit smaller that seems fine maybe a bit bigger yeah that's sounds looks looks around right i can then select the area in which i want them uh ctrl shift i to invert the selection and then hit delete to get rid of everything else ctrl d to deselect and then just go to town and remove remove that delete remove that delete that gets removed lit also that uh what else there we go that's the the doorway here that gets removed and that gets removed so also also i want a a little bit of a gradient here right here just to show that this is like a better show that this is a cantilever so i'll just mark out where i want the gradient to be that goes from black to white i'll create a new layer just drag out the gradient there like this i'll say 21 something like this and it kind of you know this is without the gradient this is with so it just gives a little bit of a of a shadow there um right so we have a little bit of the corrugated steel it's not great by any stretch of imagination but it does the trick and i think what we can do is we can find some sort of a colored texture so cortan steel corten steel texture um yeah sure let's let's use this one uh open image oh that's that's a pretty low resolution but we don't care ctrl v paste it here i'll actually split it into parts ctrl x ctrl v place it here this one control x control up in this layer ctrl x ctrl v i don't know what i did but that's that that works as well like that perhaps that's good enough and then actually can we just do that yeah we can just do that no one will ever know um so this and the bottom one i will just add uh are you the bottom one no are you the bottom one yes ctrl c ctrl v just add it there okay so let me merge all of these together merge layers ctrl t to transform them a little bit more so that they're a little bit bigger um let's say multiply right so i think multiply will work and we already did some cutting so i'll just use the magic wand tool with certain tolerance and just select the cutouts like that ctrl shift i to invert delete nope uh ctrl shift i delete there we go okay so we deleted and we are kind of good to go with the with the carton steel let's make it a little bit less intense something like that i think that that that that's fine um and then for the windows i'll actually use the the magic wand tool to select the glass bam bam come on ah yay almost there there we go is that glass i i think that's glass at least and that is definitely glass okay uh so we have those done and i will just say let's do let's do control do we just use gradients rather maybe like that and then we switch the gradient to white and just give it like this kind of a kind of a tug here or maybe not perfect white um a little bit of of gray look like that look like that uh that that looks okay of course re reduce the the intensity of it the opacity of it something like this um and i think if we just kind of casually now select everything that's remaining and just edit fill shift five foreground color hit okay in a new fold in a new layer so that's shift f5 okay and we just move it below the whole thing why is that oh that's my bed so you can't do that this way huh uh i wanna i want to color the frames so how do we color the frames this is going to be uh now it's turning out to be a photoshop tutorial i want to color the frames but i don't want to select them individually so what i'm going to do is i will say okay first of all can we just do that not really oh or maybe we can control d um maybe we can if i go to curtain steel layer and i just select all of this right so i selected all of this and then we go to the window layer and we unselect holding down the alt key was it the alt key was it control i don't remember control shift no alt shift no uh how what's the shortcut for the subtract from selection it should be ctrl right no it should be shift no it should be hold there we go so it is the old key i don't know why why that didn't work out and tolerance needs to be like a hundred for this to work uh it doesn't really work that well maybe seems to be working okay now so we have that we are unselecting that oh messed up ah do i really need to do it again i know i i i figured it out this this this and that and this right we select this bear with me be patient or skip ahead you have the possibility to skip ahead um so i select inside of the windows and then i turn on the drawing and unselect the glass but why didn't it oh yeah that's because i need to be in the drawing layer and then i can unselect the glass panes planes paints glass glass thingies and it's a mess here but that's fine so i am unselecting and now i'm i'm selecting the shadowy bits as well with less tolerance maybe 32 i like tolerance of 32. it seems to work most of the time with most of the geometry so like that that good that looks good that looks okay and that also looks good okay so now we have only selected the frames for the windows which means we can create a new layer shift of five enter fill it with black color okay took us a while but we we we managed we managed to do it um let's change the the intensity so that you can see the line work and for the door um for the doors both of them actually this one still needs oh come on just give me the this one still needs the framing and for some reason it chooses to do it like that to select it like that so let me just for this frame i'll just do it the oldfashioned way with the rectangular marquee tool there we go almost almost now there we go um is that my frames yes that that this my frames shift f5 okay okay we're done here and then select the door somehow that that doesn't let me so i will be using a marquee tool again so the door as well as the door here holding down the shift key to select the door um so these will be blue just because i can no i'm kidding it's not going to be blue i'm just going to color it blue and change it to multiply that's color burn that's not change it to multiply change the opacity to be 33 ish 36 ctrl u hello ctrl u why can't i control u there we go ctrl u and then change the hue until i find a nice nice color for the doors um what works with corten steel yellow of course would work but that's kind of boring um pink red maybe red or maybe yeah let's let's just do do it traditional peachy okay that is that uh let's call it uh call it a day i i think that's that looks fine good good enough for for a tutorial uh control shift or rather control s straight up uh to save it uh let me go to desktop find my pdfs find my pdfs find my pdfs oh my god where are they car project raw pdfs goddammit raw pdfs change this to a pdf photoshop pdf format and then find my street facade there we go i can turn off layers right now don't need them hit save do you want to replace it yes okay uh high quality print preserve photoshop editing capabilities i usually have this turned off hit save pdf oh yeah of course i have it opened right here and also i have it opened right here so let me close it here and try to save it again oh just yikes um control s pdf pdf uh street facade no layers don't need that save yes replace it hit ok let's save pdf okay this time it worked so now once i close this and turn this off i can see that my street facade here is is nice and crispy so if you have adobe acrobat pro version you can select all of your pdfs right click them choose combine pdfs in acrobat then you just move them around so that's going to be the title page and then we have uh floor plans and then um poor plants yeah sure i that this works or maybe section goes in here it goes up up until there um we click on combine why is this so big we click on combine it does its magic creates a binder we can we take a closer look at it first second third fourth fifth page for me i hit file save as um we go to i'll just save it to desktop and this is where i go this is important you guys a a d a 15 l f i forgot my last name here they kiss save that's it you're done right you have your uh your pdfs where is it where is it there we go there it is you have your pdf saved right um and then you just uploaded it to the school server uh i already did a tutorial on how to do it before so i will not be repeating that but or maybe maybe i should okay so i will repeat that so if you're in the school then you can let me just mimic me being in the school without being in the school um ma'am bam ma'am just a second so in the school uh you just go to temp folder unprotected and you aad 15 hand in beautiful writing capital h capital h hendon there we go ada 15 handen open up that folder drag and drop or drag and drop not the syllabus the your your file in here that's it you've passed the course right if you don't have access if you can't get into the school remember that there is a remote desktop option right all of the information is in the on the course website under uh useful resources so there is a remote desktop version where you can log into the school's computer from your browser and just send an email to yourself with the file and load it in load it in through the remote remote desktop that that should be pretty simple to do as well so there's no need for us to do a separate server or a separate folder uh you just do it that way either one of the ways works alternatively you can always just create a vpn connection and that that's going to work as well okay i will leave you to it get to work and i hope to see some really nice narrow houses from you
