00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:10 - and today we're going to work on some
00:13 - more html and css we're just going to
00:15 - continue on with what we were doing
00:17 - yesterday
00:18 - did make a few adjustments yesterday
00:20 - mainly in the javascript so i'll briefly
00:23 - go over uh what we've done harshit
00:26 - helped out a lot with that
00:28 - and then we'll get right into it
00:31 - uh probably gonna be
00:34 - about an hour and a half for this stream
00:36 - uh we'll see
00:38 - i actually haven't been feeling that
00:40 - well so my stomach hurts really bad i
00:42 - have no idea why so
00:45 - if it gets like
00:47 - worse then maybe i'll end the stream but
00:49 - for now i think i'm okay to stream
00:54 - um let me see we may have
00:58 - i keep trying to get one of my
01:00 - co-workers to come in on the stream
01:02 - she's just starting out with coding and
01:04 - i thought it would be cool since we're
01:05 - doing beginner stuff if
01:07 - she would come in and ask questions too
01:09 - but
01:11 - she said she's too tired
01:13 - so
01:14 - we'll see we'll see if she comes
01:17 - um also my camera keeps
01:21 - stopping
01:22 - um
01:23 - so i don't know
01:26 - i can get it turned back on
01:28 - uh i'm just gonna have to keep an eye on
01:30 - it and make sure that it's it's still
01:31 - going
01:34 - so
01:35 - just to just heads up if my screen just
01:37 - freezes
01:39 - like it did just now
01:42 - then i need to restart it
01:50 - yeah so all of a sudden my fan will
01:52 - start going really fast and my camera
01:54 - shuts off
01:55 - i don't know why that's happening all
01:57 - right so let's switch over to the code
02:02 - and
02:05 - see what's going on here let me check
02:06 - the live chat quickly just to say hello
02:10 - uh looks like oh harshit wrote a blog
02:13 - today uh about graphql
02:16 - so it's really cool uh harshit's blog is
02:19 - hp
02:20 - techblogs.com
02:22 - so check that out if you want to read
02:24 - some of his blogs
02:27 - hey everybody
02:29 - um
02:33 - all right
02:35 - oh cool um
02:36 - ethan said great holiday sweater
02:39 - yeah i actually have two holidays let me
02:41 - show you all this other holiday sweater
02:43 - i got i should have done it when i had
02:45 - the camera on
02:46 - full so
02:49 - here i'll switch it back really quickly
02:51 - so we had a white elephant uh christmas
02:54 - gift exchange so
02:56 - uh at my my office today and i got this
03:00 - women's christmas sweater vest
03:03 - so
03:04 - i was wearing it around earlier i have a
03:06 - picture of me with it on on my instagram
03:08 - now
03:09 - because it actually fits me evidently
03:12 - women's size medium is the perfect size
03:14 - for me
03:18 - so
03:20 - i think i'll probably give it to my wife
03:22 - though
03:28 - let's see
03:34 - also i do want to mention since ethan's
03:36 - here in the live chat so ethan did a um
03:40 - a stream two days ago i think it was two
03:42 - days ago
03:43 - um
03:44 - he went through a bunch of the new es6
03:47 - challenges for free code camp
03:50 - and um went through them all solved them
03:53 - uh wrote the tests
03:55 - uh so it was really cool i i watched
03:57 - some of the stream live and i watched
04:00 - some of the recording of it as well and
04:03 - you did a great job ethan so
04:05 - uh anyway if you haven't checked that
04:07 - out already i think it's really cool and
04:08 - it's a good overview if you would like
04:10 - to contribute to any of the free code
04:12 - camp challenges then you know check out
04:14 - that video and
04:16 - just to get a perspective of how someone
04:18 - else contributes
04:20 - and then maybe
04:22 - it will give you a good idea if that's
04:24 - something you'd like to do
04:29 - uh andrew
04:32 - says
04:33 - uh is also learning graphql alongside
04:35 - gatsby intimidating at first but it
04:38 - seems really powerful uh yeah definitely
04:40 - though that was what i thought about it
04:42 - at first uh if you're not using graphql
04:45 - already
04:46 - check it out we've done some streams
04:48 - about it you can go back and watch those
04:49 - uh we'll be doing more streams with
04:51 - graphql later on
04:53 - but now that i've used it i don't ever
04:55 - want to use anything else
04:57 - so if you're using maybe rest apis right
05:00 - now
05:01 - check out graphql it's it's worth
05:04 - learning
05:05 - all right um ethan said thank you so
05:08 - much you're welcome no problem
05:11 - all right um
05:13 - hey vernice here
05:15 - i do okay so uh vernique says hey jesse
05:17 - hope you remember me from nashville in
05:19 - november i was the one you're helping
05:21 - with the bookstore project i'm still
05:22 - learning yeah for sure i remember
05:25 - i was just wondering recently how you
05:27 - were doing with the project
05:28 - um so
05:31 - i don't know what
05:33 - yeah i don't remember just like out of
05:35 - nowhere i was thinking hey did she ever
05:37 - finish that project but anyway thanks so
05:39 - much uh for uh for coming on and
05:42 - checking out the stream
05:46 - all right let's
05:49 - yeah let me get started okay you're
05:51 - still working on it vernee
05:55 - cool you'll have to um
05:57 - if you can i'd love to check out the
06:00 - project once it's finished
06:02 - so i know there was some of the api
06:04 - you're trying to hit was uh you could
06:06 - only access it from a certain place so i
06:08 - don't know if you
06:10 - if i could see a working version of it
06:12 - but if it's possible that would be kind
06:13 - of cool if you're up for it
06:16 - okay so let me get started
06:19 - and let me start my pomodoro cycle if
06:22 - you haven't watched before i kind of
06:23 - break the stream up into several
06:25 - pomodoro sessions
06:28 - so we do 25 minutes of code we take a
06:30 - five minute break and i answer some of
06:31 - your questions in the live chat and we
06:33 - do another 25 minute session
06:35 - and then after that
06:37 - the whole second half of the stream is
06:40 - all just answering questions in the live
06:42 - chat
06:44 - so
06:45 - be patient if you ask a question
06:47 - and i will get to it at some point
06:49 - during the stream
06:51 - all right so let me switch back so you
06:53 - all can see the code
06:56 - so very quickly let me show you what
06:58 - i've done
06:59 - and what hardship has done
07:01 - in terms of
07:02 - correcting the problem we were having
07:04 - yesterday so if you remember yesterday
07:06 - we had
07:07 - um
07:09 - the deed let me bring
07:13 - let it bring over the website so you all
07:15 - can see it it's on my other screen now
07:19 - i have too many screens open
07:34 - sorry still trying to find it
07:38 - there we go okay
07:41 - so
07:42 - yesterday we were having problems where
07:44 - these were
07:46 - all um
07:48 - like drop downs right they were hidden
07:50 - by default you had to click on details
07:52 - to get them to show so obviously we
07:54 - solved that problem right it you can see
07:57 - everything by default so here's how we
07:59 - did that
08:01 - so harshit submitted a pull request
08:04 - yesterday and
08:07 - uh went through
08:08 - let me make this a bit bigger i'm gonna
08:10 - hide this on the side make it bigger
08:14 - and we don't need this right now so i'm
08:16 - going to shrink it
08:18 - and let me know if that's not big enough
08:20 - for the font size i can make it even
08:22 - bigger
08:25 - uh let me get
08:36 - okay let's um
08:39 - someone asked about ngrok so let me give
08:41 - give you that link i think i still have
08:44 - the server on from yesterday
08:46 - i never yeah i do
08:48 - so i never turned it off so here's the
08:50 - link
08:52 - so you can check out the site live as
08:53 - we're working on it
08:55 - and um if you want
09:00 - let me give you the the ending so this
09:02 - is where we're at
09:04 - so if you want to paste that onto the
09:06 - end of the link
09:08 - that's what page we're on
09:15 - the program i'm using as my editor is
09:17 - visual studio code it's for microsoft
09:20 - and it is free
09:23 - uh
09:24 - let's see
09:25 - oh harshit says that i can remove this
09:27 - globalx content that was for testing all
09:29 - right cool
09:31 - thanks yeah i wasn't sure why that was
09:33 - in there uh but it worked with it in
09:35 - there and um
09:38 - i've been harsh it's been working with
09:40 - me on these projects for long enough
09:41 - that i i trust
09:46 - that that was okay to have in there so
09:48 - anyway i left it in we'll take it out
09:50 - now
09:51 - so basically
09:53 - it's just using a regular expression
09:55 - here
09:56 - um and then it's replacing it with
10:00 - in this case a div that's class of
10:02 - details and then a closing div
10:04 - so i had to change a little bit
10:07 - so the problem i was having originally
10:09 - was that there were some other tags
10:12 - that had the word details in the tag and
10:15 - it was catching those
10:18 - tags as well
10:19 - and it was changing it so
10:22 - it has some really weird things
10:23 - happening with the html
10:26 - so what i did was included the entire
10:29 - tag so in the opening and closing
10:32 - brackets and then here i included the
10:34 - slash as well so i have you see i have a
10:37 - two two different slashes here the first
10:39 - one
10:41 - tells
10:42 - the first one basically means whatever i
10:44 - type next uh
10:46 - you know
10:47 - treat it as part of what i'm looking for
10:50 - you know because normally the slash
10:51 - would have a special meaning in a
10:53 - regular expression but in this case i i
10:56 - actually want to search for a tag that
10:57 - has that slash in there
10:59 - okay so
11:01 - um the g means global so we're gonna try
11:04 - to find every instance of that
11:06 - uh so anyway that's that's really the
11:08 - only changes i made uh from what uh what
11:11 - horseshit had done
11:14 - and that that works
11:16 - also in our css which we'll be working
11:18 - mainly in our css now i added this right
11:22 - column blogs and the br tag
11:26 - to our list of things not to display
11:29 - because there were some really weird
11:31 - positioning things going on because of
11:33 - these two
11:35 - this was an element that had a lot of
11:38 - stuff in it but it was all empty but
11:40 - those things are still taking up a lot
11:42 - of space
11:43 - and then there's for some reason
11:45 - wordpress is inserting a ton of breaks
11:48 - so
11:50 - until i figure out how to fix that on
11:52 - the wordpress side of things
11:54 - i just decided to display none for for
11:57 - the you know br tags
12:01 - all right so that's where we are now
12:03 - once once i did that with the br tags
12:05 - though some
12:07 - things got out of place so these were
12:09 - all stacked on top of each other
12:12 - uh now you can see they're side by side
12:15 - they're definitely better stacked on top
12:17 - of each other but instead of adding the
12:19 - the breaks
12:22 - we'll just add some some css to get them
12:25 - positioned properly
12:33 - all right so let's go
12:36 - let's go to our dev tools so i'm going
12:38 - to inspect this
12:40 - and let's move this over to the side
12:45 - and uh the first thing we're going to
12:46 - try to do because i think it'll look um
12:50 - pretty simple
12:52 - uh and clean
12:54 - is we're just going to try to get this
12:56 - all to display properly right in a row
12:59 - and this will be the way we want it to
13:01 - look
13:02 - on a small screen so let's say like on a
13:06 - on a phone screen
13:08 - right so
13:09 - the way we'll probably do this is we'll
13:11 - start with a small screen view get it
13:14 - looking good and then expand
13:17 - and then see what adjustments we should
13:19 - make for a larger screen i guess you
13:21 - could call this like mobile first
13:24 - um so
13:28 - that's the way we're going to do it so
13:29 - today i'd like to
13:30 - you know get these all stacked properly
13:33 - and then get the formatting on this list
13:38 - we need to fix it a bit that's font's
13:40 - too small i don't want it to be bolded
13:42 - so
13:44 - if we can accomplish that today i'll be
13:45 - happy
13:47 - so first things first let's get these
13:49 - stacked i want the title at the top
13:50 - above the image and then i want these
13:53 - items
13:54 - phone number email
13:56 - this link to a cv
13:58 - all stacked
14:00 - so first let's check out this title
14:02 - and probably the easiest way to make
14:05 - them stack will be to do a display block
14:09 - all right so if we do a display block
14:11 - it's stacked right there so
14:15 - what i'm going to do then is
14:18 - just take all of these
14:22 - elements
14:24 - and add display block to them
14:27 - so i'm going to move this off to the
14:28 - side now so i can see it and i'm gonna
14:30 - go back in here
14:33 - and
14:34 - let's add
14:36 - add a few things in
14:39 - so
14:40 - this is all just plain css
14:44 - we're going to add the name
14:46 - name
14:48 - tag there's a lot of custom html tags
14:50 - which is it's valid to do this but it
14:52 - may look a little strange
14:55 - and we also need the phone and email
15:02 - email
15:03 - and let's go cv link
15:08 - now there's another tag here that we're
15:11 - not using right now but
15:14 - some faculty member profiles might have
15:16 - it so i'm going to add it in here and
15:17 - that's a video embed
15:23 - alright so
15:25 - just in case we run into that later on
15:26 - it should be covered by these rules
15:30 - and
15:31 - the last thing we have is center column
15:34 - details and that would be that um this
15:38 - education right here
15:42 - that's the center column details so
15:44 - we'll add that as well
15:51 - all right so
15:52 - now we're going gonna do a display
15:58 - oops
16:02 - display block
16:04 - and
16:04 - let's save that
16:08 - and we'll give it a refresh
16:12 - all right cool so
16:14 - uh now we have this all stacked up
16:18 - hmm
16:23 - well that's interesting
16:25 - i i now remember that we did not do
16:27 - anything
16:28 - uh to make this responsive
16:32 - at the top
16:33 - so we make sure
16:35 - we won't forget that
16:38 - uh so that that's gonna mess with
16:41 - our responsiveness a bit here or being
16:43 - able to test it out properly so
16:46 - i'm gonna just open this a little bit so
16:48 - we can see
16:49 - what's going on here
16:52 - and try to get that fixed
16:56 - probably the next thing i do will be
16:58 - fixing that
16:59 - alright so that's not bad
17:05 - let's look at our spacing we're going to
17:07 - need to add a little bit more spacing
17:09 - here um above
17:11 - education
17:14 - i think we should add some spacing
17:16 - between the image and that phone number
17:20 - maybe a little bit see on this image it
17:23 - doesn't look bad because there's so much
17:24 - white at the top but i think on a
17:26 - different image where there's not so
17:28 - much white this is going to look cramped
17:30 - so let's add maybe
17:32 - you know eight pixels of space here
17:34 - we'll try maybe 16
17:37 - and
17:39 - that should be okay for this i do want
17:40 - to check the font size on this
17:43 - it looks a little small for me a little
17:46 - smaller than i like
17:55 - let's bring this back over
17:57 - so we can check the font
18:00 - size
18:06 - i guess we have no font size
18:09 - set so is it
18:12 - automatically setting
18:18 - that's odd i guess it's just going to
18:20 - whatever the default is
18:22 - so
18:23 - what i'd like to have
18:28 - let's just see
18:31 - what's uh 16 pixels
18:35 - all right so we were at 16. i thought it
18:38 - was 16
18:40 - 16 is not bad but i'd like to go closer
18:43 - to 18.
18:52 - we'll try 18 on everything um
18:56 - if it looks
18:58 - we'll see how it looks i like to go with
19:00 - a larger font
19:02 - uh you know for readability
19:07 - uh
19:08 - let's see
19:09 - all right so let's go ahead and put
19:12 - in here for
19:18 - for the p tags
19:21 - we want font size
19:24 - to be
19:26 - 18 pixels
19:28 - and that's not going to cover everything
19:31 - uh because we have some things in in
19:34 - other tags but
19:35 - we'll add those as we as we find them
19:39 - uh now let's let's try to add here under
19:41 - our title uh let's let's do it in dev
19:44 - tools so that you know we can see the
19:47 - result
19:48 - so let's go with the margin
19:53 - bottom
19:54 - of let's try eight pixels first and see
19:57 - how that looks
19:59 - actually that's not bad it's hard to see
20:01 - right because of
20:03 - you know the color of that image but i
20:05 - think eight eight works
20:08 - you know what i think is i'd also maybe
20:11 - like to change the
20:12 - the font size
20:15 - i don't know where i
20:19 - here we go so i already had name here
20:21 - before
20:22 - font size 24. let's try 26 for that font
20:26 - size
20:27 - and then we'll go margin
20:31 - bottom
20:33 - eight pixels
20:35 - so we do uh try to follow material
20:37 - design and usually in material design
20:39 - things go in in like eight so you see
20:42 - eight pixels a lot 16 pixels uh as
20:46 - kind of the spacing between things
20:50 - so that that's what i usually start out
20:52 - with 8 16
20:54 - um
20:56 - 24.
20:57 - i use those values a lot
21:01 - all right so that's fine for that one
21:03 - let's try to do a similar spacing here
21:06 - and this is under a phone
21:08 - uh so
21:10 - let's do
21:11 - whoops accidentally put that on the tag
21:14 - with with all this in here uh which it
21:16 - might not be bad to add some spacing in
21:18 - but i don't think that much spacing is
21:22 - yeah i don't know that i would want that
21:23 - much spacing
21:25 - uh so here on this tag let's go with
21:31 - margin top
21:33 - of
21:36 - yeah let's go eight
21:39 - that's not bad
21:41 - i thought it would be too small but
21:42 - let's just stick with eight for now
21:47 - and
21:50 - yeah we'll stick with eight for now
21:54 - i do want to make sure we have a proper
21:57 - line height for everything too so we'll
22:00 - take care of that in a second
22:02 - so here
22:06 - let's just take this
22:10 - and i'm going to get rid of this font
22:13 - size and i'm going to change this to
22:15 - phone
22:19 - all right
22:21 - you can see right now i have very little
22:23 - organization to the css
22:25 - we may end up converting this and using
22:28 - it like in the component at some point
22:30 - uh or if we do leave it as css you know
22:33 - we'll kind of try to organize it better
22:36 - but for right now
22:39 - it's we don't have a lot so
22:41 - i'm not super worried about organization
22:46 - that may not be the best way to do it
22:47 - but i usually i don't worry about that
22:50 - when i only have a few lines
22:53 - all right so let's do this center column
22:55 - details and we're going to add
22:59 - margin
23:01 - top
23:03 - uh i'm going to try 16 pixels yeah 16 is
23:07 - better okay because we really want to
23:09 - separate that out you know from from
23:12 - this
23:13 - so
23:14 - 16
23:16 - looks good
23:17 - uh and that heading could maybe be a bit
23:20 - bigger as well
23:22 - so
23:24 - let's try to do the heading
23:26 - um
23:28 - let me add a class for heading let's try
23:31 - to make all those those headings there
23:35 - uh 20
23:36 - let's let's try 22 pixels
23:44 - all right i'm gonna see this in
23:46 - comparison to the title here
23:48 - um
23:53 - actually i want the title to be larger
23:55 - i'm not sure though that what we've done
23:57 - to the title has actually taken effect
23:59 - yet so
24:00 - uh because we did change that and make
24:02 - it a bit bigger
24:05 - okay but i like that
24:08 - so
24:10 - let's let's check with that this is
24:12 - center column details
24:22 - the center column details is going to
24:24 - get a
24:26 - margin top of 16 pixels
24:31 - and
24:33 - then the header
24:37 - heading
24:39 - yeah it's called a heading right heading
24:41 - is going to get a font size
24:44 - of
24:46 - 22 pixels
24:48 - let's double check to make sure we
24:50 - increased our font size for name and we
24:52 - did
24:55 - all right
24:56 - so i'm going to save that and i'm going
24:58 - to refresh it now so we can see all of
25:00 - our changes
25:02 - okay
25:03 - uh yeah this is still
25:05 - it's still not looking as big as i would
25:08 - like it to be
25:10 - even though we made the font size 26
25:13 - so let's go
25:16 - let's go with 30 and let me
25:18 - make sure
25:21 - okay i'm not zoomed in
25:23 - all right i'm going to go with 30 for
25:24 - this one because i want it to be
25:26 - obviously you know bigger
25:29 - than these subheadings and i think at 30
25:32 - you you can get that immediately
25:33 - anything lower than that and it's not
25:37 - uh you have to kind of look at it more
25:39 - closely to tell so
25:41 - let's go with 30.
25:46 - and again if you're just joining me and
25:48 - you haven't watched the streams before
25:50 - please
25:52 - be patient if you've written a question
25:54 - in the live chat i will get to the
25:56 - questions in the live chat uh in just a
25:58 - few minutes i split things up and i do
26:00 - some coding and then i go back to the
26:02 - live chat so i'm in the coding session
26:04 - right now
26:05 - uh and then we'll do some question and
26:07 - answer stuff here in just a little bit
26:11 - all right so let's do that i did notice
26:12 - something with the phone number
26:15 - where i put the wrong thing so i it
26:19 - should have been margin top
26:21 - and i just copied from name
26:24 - and so i got the wrong
26:27 - wrong thing it there we go okay much
26:29 - better
26:31 - let's see
26:34 - i want to make sure our font size change
26:37 - took effect yes font size 18
26:40 - but it seems like on this we're we're
26:43 - not at font size 18. so let's add in
26:48 - to our font size 18.
26:52 - let's just add in
26:53 - ul's as well and see if that'll cover
26:57 - uh what we want and actually
27:00 - yeah let's
27:03 - let's try to do it here
27:09 - so it looked like there wasn't a font
27:11 - size set at all
27:13 - so we may be able to just cover
27:15 - everything if we put this on main here
27:17 - and then the ones that we specified here
27:19 - should override that
27:22 - let's see if it works that way
27:27 - okay
27:28 - all right not bad
27:31 - now this looks right i'm going to double
27:33 - check though
27:41 - okay it's inherited that
27:43 - yeah let's see if
27:48 - let's see if i took that off
27:53 - okay so that one main didn't really do
27:55 - much
28:00 - okay so i may as well take that off of
28:02 - main since it didn't do anything anyway
28:04 - and it's working on almost everything we
28:07 - just have these so let's see what kind
28:09 - of tag that is
28:11 - oh h6
28:13 - that's odd
28:16 - okay so uh we're gonna have to
28:20 - override the default size for an h6
28:26 - so i usually i i don't like to override
28:29 - the h tags as much
28:32 - if i don't have to but in this case
28:34 - obviously we can't have it that small
28:37 - so let's override those h tags and we
28:40 - can try to be specific and say h tags
28:43 - that are just within an li
28:49 - it it probably doesn't matter i'm
28:51 - thinking the only place where we're
28:52 - going to see h6s on the faculty pages
28:55 - are in here
28:58 - um
28:59 - but
29:00 - i i honestly think it'll help me reading
29:02 - this later on
29:03 - to know why exactly i made that change
29:06 - the 86 if i specify here that it was in
29:09 - an li
29:16 - h6 and let's do font size let's make
29:19 - them this should be the same as the
29:21 - headings no we need them to be smaller
29:23 - than the headings
29:27 - let's make these
29:38 - let's let's try 20.
29:51 - okay 20 pixels looks pretty big
29:54 - you know what i don't mind 20 pixels
29:56 - there
29:58 - so
30:03 - i don't really even mind 18 but i do
30:06 - want to take off the the bold
30:09 - so
30:13 - let's you know let's play with the font
30:14 - weight a bit
30:17 - so uh font weight is kind of like the
30:20 - boldness right of the um
30:23 - uh
30:24 - of the font so we're gonna take it
30:26 - through some
30:28 - here 400 is the baseline of what we have
30:31 - everywhere right now
30:34 - all right
30:36 - we could go five
30:50 - did we have five or six
30:54 - let's try five right now and let me take
30:57 - this off
30:58 - yeah it looks like it's six so i don't
31:01 - want six hundred
31:02 - five looks much better
31:04 - and we still have a little distinction
31:06 - there
31:07 - um
31:09 - let's
31:12 - let's check this out i want to see
31:17 - let's see what what it'll look like if
31:19 - we change all these font weights to
31:22 - 300.
31:34 - hmm
31:37 - i actually really like the look of a
31:39 - thinner font
31:41 - i'm going to stake i'm going to keep
31:43 - that thinner font now
31:45 - but
31:47 - definitely want to test this
31:49 - it may not be as readable
31:53 - on
31:54 - on certain screens
31:56 - so
31:58 - i'm gonna
32:00 - kind of tentatively
32:03 - uh keep the font
32:05 - uh font weight at
32:08 - 300.
32:09 - all right so let's add this
32:13 - here as
32:17 - font weight
32:19 - 300
32:23 - and then our eight sixes as font size
32:29 - would we have that at 20
32:32 - and then font
32:34 - weight
32:37 - at
32:40 - what was we said 400 yeah
32:46 - okay
32:48 - all right so i'm going to save that
32:49 - give it a refresh to see if anything
32:51 - looks really weird no that looks fine
32:57 - at least on my monitor that font still
32:59 - seems really small
33:03 - i mean is that really 18 it just seems
33:06 - it is really 18. wow
33:12 - there we go all right so line height 1.5
33:16 - at least for me on my screen makes it
33:18 - seem a lot more readable
33:20 - so
33:22 - let's add that in as well
33:24 - i usually use a line height of 1.5
33:28 - so
33:30 - that's not bad we'll stick with that
33:32 - actually
33:36 - yeah we'll keep it
33:38 - line height 1.5
33:41 - okay
33:42 - now my pomodoro timer did go off a
33:44 - minute or two ago so i'm gonna go short
33:47 - five minute break i'm gonna go back to
33:48 - the live chat right now
33:51 - and um
33:53 - i will
33:55 - answer as many questions as i can
33:57 - also just notice that my camera shut off
34:00 - so
34:01 - i'm gonna get that camera started again
34:11 - there we go
34:12 - i guess it doesn't really matter if you
34:13 - all can see me so
34:16 - not a big deal i'm going to leave it on
34:18 - this screen so i can see my timer
34:22 - and i'm going to scroll up
34:23 - see what questions i missed
34:27 - nino says do you think php is a good
34:29 - language because there's a big
34:32 - gap in that field and a big opportunity
34:35 - to make something
34:37 - um
34:38 - it
34:39 - my feeling on uh programming languages
34:42 - is you can build good things and
34:44 - terrible things with any programming
34:46 - language so i personally don't have as
34:50 - much fun building things in php i enjoy
34:53 - javascript more
34:57 - so there are certain languages that i
34:58 - personally like more than others just
35:00 - because of my experience with it how
35:03 - good i am with those languages
35:05 - you know the amount of syntax that it
35:07 - takes right like python just seems more
35:09 - fun
35:09 - to me than php uh just
35:13 - because of the syntax right but it does
35:15 - depend on your exposure so i would say
35:20 - if you enjoy using php and you can get a
35:23 - job with it then use php
35:29 - i don't really know any of the
35:30 - statistics as to whether or not
35:32 - jobs and php are growing or shrinking or
35:35 - anything like that
35:37 - but you might want to look into that as
35:39 - well uh if you're trying to plan out you
35:42 - know what you want to do for your career
35:44 - another good thing to keep in mind is
35:46 - it's not that hard to switch from one
35:48 - program programming language to another
35:51 - so even if you decide to specialize in
35:53 - one now
35:55 - you could always change it up later on
35:57 - you know if
35:59 - you know if things shift you know you
36:01 - gotta
36:02 - you know you have to learn what you need
36:04 - you know for your job be able to support
36:06 - yourself and your family pay the bills
36:19 - oh okay harsha's
36:20 - irish it says uh and this was a little
36:22 - while ago it said it's it's 1 30 pm
36:25 - there so he's really sleepy yeah uh i'm
36:28 - sorry am i am
36:30 - um yeah harshit
36:33 - if um
36:34 - if you if you need to go to sleep by all
36:37 - means go to sleep i only i just had to
36:39 - start later today because uh we had a
36:41 - christmas party here at the office
36:43 - so
36:44 - i'll i'll try to make sure i don't
36:45 - stream this late
36:48 - usually
36:54 - let's see
36:56 - uh harshit recommends moving the css to
36:58 - a style jsx tag so that it may be scoped
37:01 - and non-render blocking and splitted it
37:04 - will also give live reloading or should
37:06 - i think i will move it into a tag like
37:08 - that for these videos since i i wanted
37:10 - to take this opportunity to do some
37:12 - videos that would be
37:14 - as easy as possible for beginners to
37:17 - understand i decided to use the css file
37:20 - but you're you're completely right we
37:22 - will get some benefits from moving it
37:25 - into our component with the style.jsx
37:28 - tag so
37:29 - if if you don't know much about react
37:31 - and you didn't understand what we i was
37:32 - just talking about don't worry about it
37:36 - it's it's just a certain way you could
37:39 - do something when working with react so
37:42 - you don't need to worry about it unless
37:43 - you really want to learn react
37:51 - uh let's see sergio says hello i'm new
37:55 - here is he doing some kind of free code
37:57 - camp challenges i'm not doing the
37:59 - challenges right now in this stream i
38:01 - actually work on the projects that i
38:03 - need to for my job as a front-end
38:05 - developer i work for a small university
38:08 - and so we're redoing the main website
38:11 - for our university
38:13 - and so that's what i'm working on right
38:15 - now i'm working on a template that's
38:18 - going to display all the faculty members
38:20 - here at the university
38:29 - uh
38:30 - moises asks what are those colors on the
38:34 - number column
38:36 - um
38:38 - i'm not sure
38:42 - i'm not exactly sure what you're asking
38:44 - like what number column you're asking
38:46 - about so
38:47 - if you can if you're still watching uh
38:49 - could you give me some hints as to what
38:52 - number column you're talking about i'm
38:54 - sure if i would have saw your comment
38:55 - while i was doing it it would have been
38:57 - obvious but now after the fact i can't
38:59 - remember what i was doing
39:02 - that would have a number column uh so
39:06 - anyway i'd love to answer your question
39:07 - just need a little bit more info if
39:09 - possible please
39:11 - uh okay so i'm going to go back to the
39:15 - coding for a bit
39:18 - and then i'll come back in the live chat
39:20 - so if i didn't get to your question yet
39:22 - stick around for a little while if you
39:23 - can and i will get to your question
39:27 - if for some reason you can't stick
39:28 - around i'll still answer your question
39:30 - later on and you can always watch the
39:31 - recording of this video
39:33 - uh and
39:36 - uh hear the answer to your question
39:38 - uh you know whatever time you feel like
39:40 - watching the recording
39:45 - okay
39:47 - so let's start this up
39:50 - uh we'll do one more pomodoro session
39:54 - let's see
39:55 - okay i think we're good
39:57 - i do need to make sure that i'm home in
39:59 - time uh to watch the baby so my wife is
40:03 - and most of my kids are gonna go
40:04 - christmas caroling at a nursing home
40:09 - but uh my youngest cordelia who's
40:12 - one and a half
40:13 - almost
40:15 - um she was sick last night so obviously
40:18 - we don't want her going to nursing home
40:19 - she might get you know the people that
40:21 - are sick so i'm gonna stay home with her
40:24 - but that means i have to make sure i'm
40:25 - home from work and enough time for for
40:27 - them to get over to the nursing home
40:30 - all right
40:32 - so let's see what we want to do now
40:35 - all right so we have everything in a
40:36 - column the spacing is not bad it's not
40:41 - perfect
40:43 - let's see what we can do about it
40:52 - all right it looks like we need less
40:53 - spacing between education
40:56 - and this first bullet point
40:58 - we need
41:00 - to make
41:01 - education
41:02 - as a header and these we need to make
41:05 - them the same
41:06 - it looks like
41:08 - something's off in here so maybe it's
41:12 - i think it's the weight uh
41:15 - so we'll have to match the font weight
41:17 - so i think this is 400 and this looks
41:19 - like 300.
41:21 - so let's match those font weights and
41:23 - then let's change the
41:26 - yeah it's it's going to be slight but i
41:28 - definitely think there's less spacing
41:30 - here so we're going to change that up a
41:32 - bit
41:34 - and then we'll move on and we'll work on
41:36 - the spacing down here
41:38 - okay so first things first
41:42 - let's see what tag this is so this is a
41:44 - heading
41:45 - heading tag
41:47 - and
41:49 - i think if we put
41:52 - font weight
41:54 - 400 yep that should do it for the font
41:57 - weight and then let's do a
42:01 - margin bottom uh let's let's see where
42:03 - we're at let's do a zero first
42:06 - all right so
42:08 - we don't really have
42:10 - yeah we have nothing there right now
42:12 - what's giving us that space
42:16 - there we go it's it's inside of a
42:19 - paragraph tag
42:22 - that's our problem
42:24 - let's see what we can do where is this
42:26 - paragraph tag
42:29 - you know what we probably don't even
42:30 - originally have a paragraph tag it's
42:32 - just wordpress is adding this in here
42:34 - for us
42:42 - all right we can we can select just this
42:44 - paragraph tag
42:46 - and let's do that here just to test it
42:49 - out and let's go with the margin
42:53 - oops
42:56 - bottom of zero
43:04 - that didn't even move it up did it
43:09 - now it's making no difference
43:11 - interesting
43:18 - that's really odd
43:22 - okay well i guess we won't worry about
43:24 - that let's take this off there now
43:27 - and
43:30 - well in this case
43:32 - i think we're just gonna have to do a
43:33 - negative margin if we can here
43:39 - uh so let's find
43:42 - where are we at
43:44 - so we gotta go inside this p tag again
43:47 - and let's find this
43:50 - let's go with the center column details
43:54 - and let's add our margin onto this
43:58 - so let's go margin
44:00 - oops
44:04 - margin bottom
44:05 - of
44:06 - let's go with a negative eight pixels
44:10 - and now i'm gonna have to i'm gonna
44:13 - eyeball this a bit
44:16 - for now
44:17 - if we can get it close i'll be all right
44:19 - with that
44:26 - that looks pretty close
44:28 - i'm gonna leave it at that for now
44:29 - because that's
44:32 - yeah
44:33 - that's really really close
44:35 - okay
44:37 - so we're going to add a margin bottom of
44:39 - 8
44:41 - to our center column details
44:48 - and then we're also going to add that
44:52 - uh where is it at
44:56 - heading we're going to add that font
44:58 - size or i'm sorry font weight
45:01 - 400
45:05 - all right wonderful
45:10 - all right now let's go down hey did that
45:13 - not work
45:14 - let's inspect it
45:20 - all right it's being overridden
45:23 - which is okay so let's go in here and
45:25 - just make it a bit more specific
45:28 - um so
45:32 - i'm just gonna put this
45:34 - inside of the p for now i know that will
45:36 - work
45:43 - it should have worked
45:58 - oops i added pixels on the end
46:01 - all right so
46:03 - i may not even need this now
46:04 - uh it's supposed to just be 400 not 400
46:07 - pixels
46:10 - that's my problem
46:13 - all right great that works
46:16 - okay let's check out
46:18 - the spacing here
46:22 - i'm most worried about the space between
46:24 - these uh this should be a lot closer
46:27 - since this description goes with this of
46:30 - heading here
46:32 - so let's find our h6 and we're going to
46:34 - want to remove
46:36 - most of that bottom
46:38 - margin so we can see we have a 46.6
46:43 - uh
46:43 - down here so it's the margin is probably
46:46 - a em yeah so we have an em value
46:51 - uh let's try to make it
46:53 - let's just go right here with our six
46:56 - let's go margin
47:01 - bottom
47:02 - let's give it eight pixels oh i like
47:05 - that yeah i like that a lot okay
47:09 - and actually let's go with the margin
47:11 - top
47:16 - of 16 pixels
47:19 - yeah much better
47:21 - much better
47:28 - hmm
47:29 - you know what i may even wanna
47:33 - let's increase this
47:38 - to 24
47:40 - and let's bump this down
47:45 - all right so something else is messing
47:46 - it up it's it should be
47:50 - all right
47:55 - let's figure out what else is messing
47:57 - this up
48:00 - okay so on these p tags
48:03 - uh we also have a margin at the top here
48:07 - which
48:17 - in this case i think a negative margin
48:19 - is going to be the easiest
48:21 - way for us to go instead of trying to
48:23 - select these
48:24 - p tags
48:25 - and not affect some of the other ones
48:31 - so let's go back on that h6
48:35 - and
48:36 - let's go with that margin bottom and
48:38 - let's take it negative
48:42 - and
48:55 - 12 looks not bad
48:59 - yeah 12 is not bad on these headings i'd
49:03 - like to have a little bit more space
49:04 - though
49:06 - uh above each one
49:09 - all right so let's
49:11 - first put this in
49:24 - see uh see you can see the value now uh
49:27 - especially if you're just starting out
49:29 - the value of using devtools of being
49:32 - able to immediately just kind of adjust
49:34 - your changes and then you can just copy
49:36 - and paste them right over into here
49:38 - you know just quickly hit save and then
49:41 - a refresh on your browser
49:43 - just to double check that everything
49:45 - worked
49:46 - and there you know just kind of line by
49:48 - line
49:50 - you
49:51 - can test your
49:53 - uh your styles
49:55 - and
49:56 - you know we've kind of made quick work
49:57 - of of this page and cleaned it up quite
49:59 - a bit
50:02 - and we have like a really nice tight
50:04 - feedback loop you know like immediately
50:06 - we can see the changes
50:08 - so it can
50:11 - at least for me it you know really helps
50:13 - save a lot of time you know being able
50:15 - to
50:16 - you know do things like this
50:19 - okay
50:20 - i want to
50:22 - now add a margin on the top of these
50:25 - headings
50:30 - sorry for the yawn
50:34 - okay
50:42 - margin top
50:47 - 16
50:48 - no it's not working
50:50 - why is it not working all right so let's
50:52 - let's go up a bit here
50:54 - to these right column details and let's
50:56 - add it on right column details
51:03 - margin top 16
51:06 - pixels
51:09 - um
51:11 - that's not working either
51:16 - all right let's add it to the bottom
51:18 - then
51:18 - see if we can make it work on the bottom
51:39 - all right this is odd
51:42 - i'm not able
51:45 - to change the
51:49 - margins and padding here
51:51 - why can i not do that
51:55 - all right
51:58 - i know i've run into things like this
51:59 - before
52:01 - and i can't really remember
52:03 - oops you know what
52:05 - maybe um
52:09 - ah that's why i chose the wrong
52:12 - wrong thing okay let's try this again
52:15 - we want center column details
52:18 - uh so let's go with
52:22 - center column details margin bottom
52:27 - let's go 16 pixels there we go that's
52:30 - what we want uh let's try 24
52:35 - 24 pixels okay much better i just wanted
52:38 - to make it more
52:40 - apparent that these headings go with the
52:43 - what's below it all right and not with
52:46 - you know what's above so we have
52:54 - it has messed up this spacing why would
52:56 - i mess up that spacing
53:08 - hmm
53:21 - all right well i like i like this look
53:23 - i'm going to keep this look
53:45 - all right so this does look
53:49 - oh that's why
53:50 - so this was in the center column details
53:52 - as well
53:55 - hmm
54:01 - oh so we already
54:04 - we already had the center column details
54:06 - that we were using and we just overrode
54:09 - that okay
54:10 - all right
54:21 - all right let's take this out
54:26 - let's change this
54:37 - 24.
54:39 - let's see what this looks like
54:47 - okay not bad
54:48 - could use a bit more here
54:57 - uh you know why because this is actually
55:01 - this is right column details
55:04 - okay
55:13 - all right this is what we're running
55:14 - into before where
55:18 - we just had some weird things going on
55:21 - here
55:53 - all right let's see if we can do
56:27 - there we go
56:29 - all right so
56:30 - we had set everything else to display
56:32 - block but not right column details so
56:34 - let's add that to our display block
56:43 - so that's what we needed to be able to
56:45 - make this this margin work
56:47 - so we're going to do that and then we're
56:49 - going to add under right column details
56:53 - this margin
56:54 - top
56:56 - of 24.
57:06 - save that and refresh
57:10 - great all right everything looks uh how
57:13 - we wanted it to look
57:22 - not bad
57:34 - yeah not bad
57:35 - a lot better than what we started with
57:39 - let me check my time here
57:41 - about seven minutes
57:44 - um
57:45 - okay
57:46 - so let's
57:48 - well my
57:49 - camera went off again so let me set
57:51 - reset my camera
57:59 - okay cameras reset
58:03 - and
58:10 - let's think about this
58:40 - let's do um
58:45 - i'm going to try something with the
58:46 - positioning of this
58:48 - this container
58:51 - so
58:51 - this test id
58:53 - content
58:54 - should be the container for all of our
58:56 - content in here
58:58 - uh so
59:00 - i'd like to make a max
59:03 - of
59:04 - 90
59:08 - percent
59:12 - it's just going to work
59:39 - there we go
59:42 - all right so that'll bring this in a bit
59:45 - and let's try to do
59:51 - a percentage so we want this
60:03 - hmm
60:21 - let's go with
60:25 - let's do some media queries here
60:28 - all right so
60:29 - with this
60:31 - the default is going to be
60:34 - max with
60:38 - and we're going to say 90 percent
60:42 - and then we're going to give it a margin
60:45 - of
60:47 - zero auto
60:48 - which you can use to center uh something
60:51 - that is
60:54 - not everything will center like this but
60:56 - for sure if it's set to display block uh
60:58 - you can center it like this it also has
61:00 - to have a width
61:01 - all right so we're going to do that but
61:03 - then let's add this media query so let's
61:05 - go um
61:07 - media
61:08 - screen
61:10 - and
61:11 - uh let's go
61:24 - um
61:31 - with
61:32 - i'm gonna have to look at the syntax for
61:34 - this
61:35 - i haven't written a media query by hand
61:37 - in a long time
61:44 - media queries
61:57 - there we go okay it is a hyphen
61:59 - uh min width
62:01 - and
62:03 - we're gonna say
62:05 - let's just do 600 pixels for now as i'm
62:07 - in with
62:09 - and then now we're going to say we want
62:11 - the max width
62:14 - to be
62:19 - oh let's say
62:23 - 70
62:29 - oops
62:31 - forgot to put in the uh yeah let's just
62:34 - copy this
62:43 - so i'm
62:47 - there we go
62:50 - a bit spoiled by sass
62:53 - not having you write as much
62:55 - uh what did i say i wanted that to be 70
62:59 - yeah let's try 70 for that so i'm going
63:02 - to save that
63:04 - and refresh
63:05 - okay
63:07 - great so it should be 70 percent of the
63:09 - screen width in this case which
63:11 - so you can see it's only taking up 70
63:13 - percent but as we get down to lower than
63:16 - 600 pixels it changes and now it's
63:19 - taking up 90
63:21 - of the screen width right because on a
63:23 - smaller device
63:25 - you know we want to be able to show
63:26 - everything we're not as worried about
63:29 - you know screen
63:31 - uh real estate there
63:32 - so
63:35 - that's that's what i wanted i mean
63:36 - there's definitely room for
63:39 - uh adjusting that but that just roughly
63:42 - gives it you know kind of a better look
63:44 - um
63:45 - you know more of a look that we were
63:48 - used to
63:51 - and so let me explain that media query
63:53 - so if you are i i've advertised this
63:56 - stream as being a very good stream for
63:58 - beginners so let me change
64:01 - or let me go through what's what's
64:03 - happened here because this
64:04 - um is
64:06 - if you're just starting out a media
64:07 - query is kind of a somewhat tricky thing
64:09 - to deal with so here's what i've done
64:13 - i've made the default so this simply
64:16 - selects a div
64:18 - that has the attribute
64:20 - the data test id attribute of content
64:23 - okay
64:25 - because we happen to have a div like
64:26 - that so we've selected that div
64:31 - and
64:32 - this would be you know very similar to
64:34 - selecting a div that has a class of
64:37 - content right we've just kind of made up
64:40 - our own attribute there
64:41 - so by default
64:44 - the max width is 90 okay and as i said
64:47 - the zero margin zero auto centers it
64:51 - so the default size is actually the
64:53 - mobile size right
64:56 - once we get the screen bigger
64:59 - once it gets to 600 pixels right so if
65:03 - so basically this is saying
65:05 - the minimum width of the screen that
65:08 - anything within this query
65:11 - uh will work on
65:13 - is 600 pixels
65:15 - so anything below 600 pixels this will
65:18 - be ignored
65:19 - if you're above 600 pixels this will be
65:22 - run
65:23 - it's below this so it will
65:26 - use the cascading nature of cascading
65:28 - stylesheet css and it will go with
65:31 - whatever value this has
65:33 - overriding this value so that's why we
65:35 - didn't have to add margin 0 auto again
65:38 - all right that's not overwritten here
65:40 - just this one
65:41 - so once the screen gets 600 pixels
65:45 - it switches over
65:47 - all right or 600 pixels or more it
65:50 - switches over
65:52 - to max width 70 percent
65:55 - and we could put anything we wanted in
65:57 - here we could make the text
65:59 - size go to 300 if we wanted to on a big
66:02 - screen we could make the background
66:04 - color go
66:05 - green if we wanted to really anything
66:08 - you can reposition elements you know
66:11 - anything that you can do with css
66:13 - you can put inside a media query
66:16 - if you wanted to go the other way around
66:17 - and have this be the base value for a
66:20 - large screen
66:21 - and have whatever's inside the media
66:23 - query only apply on a small screen you
66:25 - just switch it and do
66:28 - max with
66:30 - instead of min with and then
66:32 - with max with what would happen is
66:35 - anything
66:37 - that's above 600 pixels
66:41 - won't have any of this stuff applied to
66:43 - it
66:44 - but if it's below 600 pixels
66:47 - then anything in here will be applied
66:50 - right so
66:52 - these i know were really tricky for me
66:55 - starting out with html and css it took
66:58 - me a long time to get comfortable enough
67:00 - to kind of write my own at first i
67:02 - always just copy and pasted ones that i
67:04 - know worked from other projects and
67:06 - would just kind of adapt those ones
67:09 - you know even now i had to look up the
67:11 - syntax so i got to about here
67:14 - and had to double check and make sure i
67:16 - was doing it right so i've been doing
67:18 - this for years and i still have to look
67:20 - up the syntax so don't feel bad about
67:21 - that
67:23 - but
67:24 - it can be tricky trying to figure out
67:26 - well should i put min or should i put
67:28 - max
67:30 - so it usually takes a lot of practice
67:32 - before you can just remember it
67:34 - and i get confused about it still
67:37 - but anyway that's basically how media
67:39 - queries work they don't have to be with
67:41 - you could set a height
67:43 - sometimes that type of thing helps if
67:45 - you're trying to target like a landscape
67:48 - view on a phone or
67:50 - you know something like that you can set
67:52 - um a width or a height right because
67:56 - some big phones
67:59 - have much larger dimensions than you
68:02 - would normally think so
68:04 - it's it's helpful uh you can target um
68:09 - a lot of other things right so
68:11 - you can actually target orientation so
68:14 - landscape or portrait uh for a phone you
68:17 - can target aspect ratio
68:20 - um
68:21 - i don't really know all the things that
68:23 - you can you can target uh you can make a
68:25 - media query just for print so it'll only
68:28 - work when the user goes to hit print
68:30 - and then you can have print only styles
68:33 - be applied
68:35 - so anyway a lot of cool stuff you can do
68:37 - with that but the most common use i've
68:39 - ever seen for these are for width
68:42 - for responsive layouts so when you hear
68:44 - people talk about responsive uh
68:47 - websites most of the responsiveness
68:50 - comes from these media queries okay
68:53 - there are some things you can do with
68:54 - javascript
68:56 - uh that can also help and some things
68:58 - you can do with setting like percentage
69:00 - widths
69:01 - on items that's very important but
69:04 - you know the magic happens in the media
69:06 - queries
69:07 - okay
69:08 - i went over my time for coding and kind
69:10 - of talked a little bit but
69:12 - i know that was really tricky for me so
69:14 - i wanted to make sure i got a good
69:15 - explanation of that and for all of you
69:17 - hopefully that made sense
69:20 - all right so now we've gone through two
69:22 - pomodoro cycles we've accomplished
69:24 - everything that we wanted to and a
69:26 - little bit more which is great
69:28 - uh i don't think i messed up anything
69:30 - today which is a very rare occurrence so
69:34 - i'm happy and my stomach quit hurting
69:36 - and i feel fine now so
69:38 - all in all this was a really amazing
69:40 - stream today
69:41 - so
69:43 - i'm going to scroll back up to where i
69:44 - left off in the live chat and i'm going
69:46 - to answer all your questions so if you
69:47 - have a question you haven't put it in
69:49 - the chat yet please do so now uh you can
69:52 - also ask me questions on twitter if you
69:54 - like my the link to my twitter account
69:56 - is in the description
69:58 - below this video you can ask questions
70:01 - in the comments to the video uh i'm on
70:04 - all the different social media things so
70:05 - get in touch with me whatever way is
70:07 - most comfortable with you i'd be happy
70:09 - to answer your questions look at some
70:11 - code for you i can't guarantee that i
70:13 - can answer right away but i'll try to
70:15 - get to it as soon as i can
70:17 - all right one benefit of asking the
70:19 - question in the live chat is you not
70:21 - only get my answer which may or may not
70:24 - even be a good answer but you also get
70:26 - the expertise of all the other very
70:27 - talented knowledgeable people that are
70:30 - in the live chat right now
70:32 - so i do recommend that as the number one
70:35 - way uh to ask a question
70:38 - all right 329.
70:41 - okay so i did leave off with uh a
70:44 - question about
70:46 - what are the colors on the number column
70:48 - i'm still not sure what that was
70:50 - referring to so hopefully uh moises i'm
70:53 - hopefully i'm pronouncing that right
70:54 - hopefully moises has clarified later on
70:57 - uh down in the live chat and we'll see
70:59 - that in a minute uh some move on here uh
71:02 - john hanson as a comment says jesse you
71:04 - stated about trusting pixel size and it
71:07 - is absolute though it's a good idea to
71:09 - let others know that rem and em is often
71:11 - a better choice when it comes to
71:12 - responsive design
71:14 - okay yeah that's a really good point um
71:20 - yeah let's let me
71:27 - foreign i'm just double checking it to
71:30 - make sure i'm getting everything in the
71:32 - conversation here about rem and ems
71:35 - um
71:36 - okay so let me address that
71:39 - i do see a lot of people use rem or em
71:42 - the reason i don't use rem or em is
71:45 - because i just don't know enough about
71:46 - them to use them comfortably
71:48 - so
71:49 - i i really
71:51 - uh i have nothing against using them
71:57 - but
71:58 - i know what i do with
72:00 - pixels will work because i've used it
72:02 - before i'm open to learning more about
72:05 - using em
72:07 - instead of pixels as a unit
72:10 - and uh if that is generally the better
72:12 - way to do things then
72:14 - you know i'll i'll try to learn it and
72:16 - i'll try to use that from now on
72:18 - uh but at least for this stream i was
72:21 - definitely not comfortable using that
72:24 - so
72:27 - i guess that's but that's a good
72:29 - disclaimer on this so if you're watching
72:31 - and you're used to using rem or em don't
72:34 - switch up the pixels just because you
72:35 - saw me do it uh i this may not be the
72:38 - best way to do it it is a way to do it
72:40 - and it works
72:41 - but there may be a better way
72:43 - uh so
72:45 - and i think that can go for everything
72:47 - that we do on this stream as well uh i'm
72:50 - definitely just showing one way to do
72:52 - things and that's the way i know how to
72:54 - do it and i'm always trying to learn
72:56 - better ways to do it
72:57 - so if if you think you know a better way
72:59 - to do something please let me know
73:02 - i can't guarantee that i'll start doing
73:04 - it right away because i'll have to learn
73:06 - how to do it first but i'll definitely
73:08 - take it into consideration and try to
73:09 - use it
73:10 - and if you ever want to submit a pull
73:12 - request to one of the projects and use a
73:14 - technique that you think is better feel
73:17 - free don't feel like you have to match
73:18 - what i'm doing all the time
73:20 - i'll review the pull request i'll check
73:22 - it out i might ask you some questions so
73:24 - that i can understand it better and i
73:26 - may end up using your technique
73:28 - in in all my future projects so that
73:30 - certainly happened before
73:32 - uh with people contributing uh pull
73:34 - requests and it just blows my mind and i
73:37 - change the way i do things
73:39 - so anyway uh john hanson thank you for
73:42 - bringing that up
73:43 - and um
73:45 - yeah i wish i could say more about the
73:47 - difference but i i said i'm just not
73:49 - knowledgeable i know uh you john and a
73:52 - few others have brought that up in past
73:54 - streams
73:55 - and uh so i think maybe it's time that i
73:57 - better uh
73:59 - do a little bit of research on that
74:02 - uh no beer says uh jesse i think
74:05 - justifying your paragraph would also be
74:06 - better
74:07 - let's check that out
74:11 - yeah maybe we can
74:16 - yeah maybe we can try that out i'm not
74:18 - going to try it right now on the stream
74:19 - but
74:21 - maybe we have to try that out we'll try
74:22 - later on or maybe on another stream
74:28 - let's see
74:30 - also uh
74:31 - i want you all that are watching let me
74:33 - know what you think about these streams
74:35 - that kind of go over more basics uh
74:38 - because a lot of the streams lately have
74:39 - been going over more advanced things
74:42 - which is fun and challenging
74:44 - but i've noticed that i'm getting a lot
74:46 - of response and a lot of different
74:48 - people watching
74:50 - when i do these beginner type streams so
74:54 - if if you all think that this is
74:55 - beneficial let me know i'll try to work
74:58 - in some beginner stuff you know maybe at
75:01 - least like once a week if i can
75:04 - uh i may not always be able to do it
75:06 - depending on what i'm working on but
75:09 - uh i
75:10 - you know i'd love to be able to you know
75:12 - have these streams be accessible to to a
75:15 - wider
75:16 - uh audience so
75:18 - let me know what you all think about it
75:34 - okay john hanson says rem is a relative
75:38 - base that can be set
75:40 - even with media with at different sizes
75:43 - em is set as em is set uh
75:47 - we'll then change the pixel sizes with
75:50 - the width changes okay that's
75:52 - interesting
75:54 - so basically we could get like a
75:56 - responsive font size with em let me know
75:59 - if that's what you're saying john if i
76:01 - have that right
76:02 - uh i think that's what you're saying and
76:04 - that actually seems really cool
76:06 - so the idea then would be
76:08 - the font size would actually get bigger
76:10 - or smaller depending on our our screen
76:13 - size
76:15 - uh which i really like that um
76:18 - i i love that idea so
76:21 - yeah let me know if i
76:23 - if i'm understanding that correctly
76:24 - please
76:26 - uh yusuf says hey i'm a newbie here and
76:30 - uh newbie decoding
76:32 - so do you think vue is a good option to
76:34 - start uh learning a framework for js
76:37 - um i haven't used vue myself but i've
76:40 - heard a lot of good things about it
76:41 - there's uh people that you know that
76:43 - work as developers that i i respect
76:46 - their work and they use view
76:49 - so i'd say it's probably fine to start
76:51 - out with but i would i would caution um
76:55 - try to learn
76:56 - some of the basics of javascript before
76:58 - you go right into the
77:01 - framework now
77:02 - i'm gonna put a big disclaimer on that
77:05 - right
77:06 - if you need to do projects and get work
77:08 - done so that you can support your family
77:10 - and pay the bills use whatever you can
77:13 - use
77:13 - right uh i totally understand that so if
77:17 - you know you can get a job or clients
77:18 - right now and
77:20 - you need to use vue
77:22 - do it but just while you're doing it
77:24 - remember to keep up you know your
77:25 - studies on normal javascript because
77:28 - that's going to set you up to succeed
77:30 - later on when let's say nobody uses vue
77:33 - anymore you know
77:34 - years down the road
77:36 - well if all you knew was view
77:38 - and you never took the time to learn
77:40 - basic vanilla javascript
77:43 - then it might be a lot harder for you to
77:45 - switch to whatever the new framework is
77:47 - that people are using
77:49 - so
77:50 - if you have time and you're learning try
77:53 - out some regular javascript first before
77:55 - you go into a framework whatever that
77:56 - framework is which view is a good one
77:59 - but if you got to jump into stuff and
78:01 - use vue
78:02 - there's nothing wrong with that
78:05 - just be aware um
78:07 - that that you take a little bit of time
78:09 - to learn you know some of the basics so
78:12 - um i'm open to other opinions on that as
78:15 - well i know i i've heard people have
78:16 - strong opinions before about making sure
78:19 - you learn vanilla javascript and
78:22 - i said assuming you have all the time in
78:24 - the world to just study
78:26 - yeah that's probably a good way to do
78:28 - things
78:30 - but realistically
78:32 - most people don't have that luxury so
78:35 - i'm i'm not gonna
78:37 - you know uh
78:38 - say hey you got to do it like this and
78:40 - make everyone feel bad for not being
78:42 - able to do that
78:44 - so
78:45 - i say try to do it the best way you
78:48 - possibly can
78:49 - within reason you know taking into
78:51 - account your situation
78:59 - let's see
79:04 - oh goodness no beer said it was it was 2
79:06 - 40 a.m uh where he's at and that was
79:10 - that was a while ago so it's probably
79:12 - after 3 a.m now
79:14 - thanks for staying up so late no beer
79:16 - please feel free to go to sleep if
79:18 - you're still awake
79:20 - yeah you can always just catch the end
79:22 - of the stream uh on the
79:24 - you know the recording
79:28 - john hanson has a quick react question
79:31 - which is better axios or fetch for in a
79:34 - simple post to a php mailer
79:38 - i have very limited experience with
79:40 - axios i've seen it in use i can't
79:43 - remember if i've ever actually used it
79:45 - myself
79:46 - but
79:47 - i am a big proponent of using fetch
79:51 - because
79:54 - it's
79:55 - well depending on the browser it's
79:56 - supported it's built in
80:00 - it's going to be more lightweight for
80:02 - you axios is another library you know
80:05 - that you have to learn
80:06 - uh more things you have to bring in i
80:08 - don't know how heavy axios is really so
80:10 - it could be super lightweight it's not
80:12 - an issue
80:13 - but
80:14 - uh i've always gone with
80:16 - fetch so
80:18 - but like i said i don't know enough
80:20 - about axios to really get into pros and
80:22 - cons other than
80:24 - i figure it's it's
80:25 - always better to just use you know
80:27 - whatever the base thing is you know for
80:29 - the browser which in this case
80:31 - is fetch not for every version of every
80:34 - browser but going forward that's i think
80:36 - that's going to be what's what's used so
80:38 - we may as well just use it now unless
80:41 - there's some feature in axios that that
80:43 - you really really need or like
80:47 - uh
80:48 - let's see
80:49 - rhaegal says in all honesty i like php
80:52 - and ruby and whatnot over javascript
80:55 - javascript just seems to do some really
80:57 - silly stuff by comparison and you have
80:59 - to second-guess it a lot
81:00 - in my opinion hey that's totally valid
81:03 - um
81:04 - let me see regal are you the one that
81:06 - asked
81:07 - earlier
81:08 - maybe not uh
81:11 - somebody had asked earlier about
81:13 - whether to learn php or something like
81:16 - that
81:16 - and
81:18 - i think i had mentioned you know it
81:20 - really kind of depends on what you like
81:22 - using
81:23 - so
81:25 - the bottom line is their jobs out there
81:27 - for php developers i mean think of all
81:29 - those wordpress sites out there right
81:31 - as long as wordpress is out there
81:33 - there's always going to be jobs for php
81:35 - developers
81:36 - um
81:37 - and then like ruby there's a lot of ruby
81:40 - sites out there there there's work for
81:42 - people in almost every language
81:44 - uh so
81:47 - find what you really love to to do and
81:49 - do it
81:50 - if you don't really have a preference
81:52 - then maybe you want to look more into
81:54 - well
81:54 - what what companies do i like to work
81:57 - for what do they use
81:58 - uh things like that
82:01 - um but
82:03 - i mean that's just the way it's gonna be
82:04 - yeah some people like chocolate ice
82:06 - cream some people like vanilla some
82:08 - people like strawberry it
82:11 - you know it's it's only natural that the
82:12 - same thing is going to happen with
82:14 - programming languages
82:15 - you know i like javascript i don't
82:18 - really care that much for php but i use
82:19 - it when i have to i don't hate it i just
82:22 - like javascript better um i don't think
82:25 - there's any programming language that i
82:26 - hate
82:28 - you know they just
82:29 - i like javascript better because i've
82:31 - had the most experience with javascript
82:33 - it makes sense to me
82:35 - right so
82:36 - you know when uh regular saying here it
82:40 - javascript seems to do some really silly
82:41 - stuff by comparison
82:43 - it doesn't seem silly to me because i'm
82:45 - used to it right
82:48 - uh so it just all kind of depends on
82:50 - what you're used to doing
82:52 - so
82:54 - there's nothing wrong with
82:56 - you know coding in whatever language you
82:58 - wanted like he said as long as
83:01 - as long as you're cool with it
83:03 - and you can do good things with that
83:04 - then you know go for it
83:07 - a good girl sammy says can you learn
83:10 - coding at 21 years old
83:12 - um
83:13 - yeah you can
83:14 - for sure
83:15 - uh
83:16 - i don't know if
83:18 - if you're asking if 21 is too old or too
83:20 - young to learn to code but i would say
83:22 - 21 is a finance to learn how to code i
83:26 - didn't really start getting into coding
83:28 - you know seriously full time until i was
83:32 - 20
83:34 - in my late 20s i can't remember how it
83:36 - was exactly so i was in my late 20s
83:39 - um
83:41 - so
83:41 - and i'm an okay coder now
83:44 - uh you all can judge for yourself
83:45 - because i've done enough live streams
83:47 - that i'm not even going to attempt to
83:48 - rank myself as a coder uh it's it's
83:51 - there for everybody to see
83:53 - um
83:54 - but
83:55 - yeah so
83:57 - um
83:58 - if you want to learn coding and you're
84:00 - 21
84:01 - go for it
84:07 - uh sergio said no you're too old most
84:09 - people start coding at 10. i'm assuming
84:11 - that that's a joke it's being sarcastic
84:14 - from sergio um
84:18 - horizon said but i like axios api more
84:21 - yeah in that case if you really like
84:23 - axios use axios
84:25 - right if axios works
84:28 - you know stick with it
84:33 - let's see
84:38 - uh
84:40 - rook says
84:41 - i'm 26 started less than a year ago
84:45 - um
84:46 - jordan asked if i was doing this in
84:48 - wordpress uh the data is coming from
84:51 - wordpress so i'm running uh what's
84:52 - called a headless
84:54 - uh installation of wordpress
84:56 - so i'm not using any of like the the
84:59 - themes right or the templates for things
85:02 - i'm just using it
85:04 - to be an admin interface for people to
85:06 - store data in a mysql database
85:10 - and then i'm using
85:11 - uh the wp graphql plugin
85:15 - to be able to
85:17 - use graphql to pull the data out and
85:20 - into our react project so what we were
85:22 - just working in
85:23 - is actually
85:24 - react but we were just pulling in a
85:27 - bunch of html and so we were doing it
85:31 - we were using just basic css and not
85:33 - really a more react style of doing css
85:38 - just
85:38 - because of the unique situation that
85:40 - we're in uh with this data so at some
85:43 - point we'd like to convert it all over
85:45 - so we can do it you know a little bit
85:47 - more properly according to the you know
85:49 - best practices with react
85:51 - uh but right now you know we need we
85:53 - just need to make sure that we get it
85:55 - looking good for launch day
85:57 - and uh so that's
85:59 - first priority
86:01 - um
86:02 - you know the other stuff will get pushed
86:04 - back and get can get taken care of after
86:06 - launch
86:21 - let's see
86:23 - uh good girl sammy is
86:26 - i'm just gonna follow this conversation
86:27 - a bit because i think it'll be helpful
86:29 - to uh newer people so good girl sammy
86:31 - says
86:33 - uh
86:35 - rook how long did it take you to learn
86:37 - it
86:38 - uh
86:39 - less than a year
86:41 - um because rickon said uh so rook
86:44 - started last year
86:46 - um
86:50 - let's see harder should ask if uh good
86:53 - girl sammy was starting from scratch
87:03 - um
87:05 - let's see
87:07 - uh john hanson says i just started html
87:10 - css
87:11 - a long time i started just html and css
87:14 - a long time ago but jquery php
87:16 - javascript react at the age of 60. never
87:20 - too old
87:22 - i like that thanks for sharing that john
87:28 - i see a hard caught that i was
87:31 - trying to use pixels on font wait thank
87:33 - you harshit
87:34 - i didn't see it in the live chat but i
87:36 - appreciate you putting it in there
87:53 - okay so good girl sammy is starting from
87:55 - scratch
87:57 - um
87:58 - but has a lot of ideas i just got to
88:00 - learn to code
88:05 - leonardo
88:06 - uh leonardo says
88:09 - what's up how are you doing how you all
88:10 - doing today uh i'm doing pretty pretty
88:13 - well uh now um
88:16 - so how's how you doing thanks for
88:18 - watching
88:22 - all right so poison said i'm glad other
88:24 - people have problems with styling i
88:26 - always thought i was the exception well
88:28 - i don't know about everybody else but i
88:30 - definitely have problems with styling
88:31 - sometimes i actually really love css i
88:34 - know i've heard some developers that are
88:36 - specialized in javascript say they don't
88:38 - like css but
88:40 - um
88:41 - i i still like it i i really like it
88:44 - it's just so easy to make things happen
88:46 - on the screen
88:48 - you know very quickly
88:50 - but it is tricky
88:51 - it's very tricky sometimes
88:58 - stephen says jesse going old school with
89:01 - straight css today yeah definitely
89:04 - uh good girl sammy says i got a question
89:06 - for you if if you got a nice idea for a
89:09 - project should you go to a company or
89:11 - should you try to build it yourself
89:13 - um
89:17 - my my answer to that would just be it
89:19 - depends on if you think you have the
89:21 - skills to be able to build it yourself
89:24 - so
89:28 - if um
89:32 - if you can
89:34 - then why not build it yourself it might
89:35 - be fun you might learn a lot in the
89:37 - process
89:38 - if it's a big idea where you think you
89:41 - know you're definitely going to need
89:42 - help with it
89:44 - or you know maybe a lot of funding
89:46 - then you might want to go to a company
89:48 - but don't really take my word for it i
89:50 - don't have a lot of experience at doing
89:52 - things like that you know sometimes i
89:54 - have ideas and i use them i figure out a
89:57 - way to use them in my my day-to-day work
89:59 - so i can work on it i don't really have
90:01 - experience with going to a company and
90:02 - proposing my ideas
90:11 - let's see
90:20 - uh john hanson asks when the production
90:23 - build is deployed to the server why is
90:25 - it that so many things keep the site
90:28 - alive in
90:29 - in cache especially when updating the
90:31 - files is there an easier way around this
90:35 - um
90:41 - john are you asking in general or in
90:43 - particular to the sites that we've been
90:44 - doing on the stream uh in general i know
90:47 - there's there can sometimes be a caching
90:49 - problem uh
90:51 - for instance like a css file might be
90:53 - cached in a user's browser and you can't
90:55 - do anything about it unless you change
90:57 - the name of the css file so there are
91:00 - some things you can get that can
91:01 - automatically change the name every time
91:03 - you update your css file and then you
91:05 - push
91:06 - it changes the references
91:08 - some of my projects the earlier projects
91:10 - were set up with gulp and uh we had it
91:13 - set up to automatically change the
91:15 - references to the files in the
91:16 - production build and change the name of
91:19 - the css so
91:21 - that's one way to get rid of it
91:23 - but otherwise you know all your caching
91:26 - options can definitely be changed if you
91:28 - have caching going on in a server
91:30 - um
91:32 - you know you can you can set all that
91:34 - yourself even if you're using a
91:37 - content delivery network like cloudflare
91:39 - or something you can still go in and you
91:41 - know manually flush the cache so
91:44 - i guess
91:46 - depending on how you set things up you
91:48 - know it can make it harder or easier
91:50 - to get rid of the cash if you make
91:52 - updates
91:53 - but there's always a way to
91:56 - to make that happen
92:08 - uh rook says that shares a lot of
92:10 - fighting the markup you have to do there
92:12 - jesse how excited are you about
92:14 - everything eventually being in the right
92:16 - spot in the database
92:19 - i'm really excited i'm trying not to
92:21 - think about it too much because i know
92:22 - that day is is months away um
92:26 - so
92:28 - i'm i resign myself to the fact that i'm
92:31 - gonna have to fight with the markup for
92:33 - a little while
92:34 - uh but i'm i'm convinced that that is
92:37 - going to be the easier the faster route
92:40 - and we need speed for this project right
92:42 - now
92:43 - so
92:45 - the cool thing is going to be too that
92:47 - when the site comes out it's definitely
92:49 - going to be an obvious improvement over
92:51 - what the current site is so people are
92:53 - going to like it it's going to load a
92:54 - lot faster it's going to be more clean
92:56 - people are going to like it but then a
92:58 - month or two after once we get the data
93:00 - all sorted out we can actually make you
93:03 - know what we have
93:04 - going on now
93:06 - even better um
93:08 - so
93:11 - it's almost i think going to be a good
93:12 - thing because users are going to see
93:15 - this big change and it's going to be so
93:16 - much better and then
93:18 - not that long after that they're going
93:20 - to see these tiny little changes in the
93:22 - different parts of the site as we get
93:24 - the data you know sorted properly
93:28 - and when we do that we pull it in to our
93:30 - react
93:31 - components
93:32 - we're going to style it a bit
93:33 - differently we're going to do it exactly
93:34 - as we would have done it if we had the
93:36 - freedom right now to do it that way all
93:38 - the freedom of the markup
93:41 - so
93:41 - i think it'll be cool for people to see
93:44 - how actively you know we're keeping up
93:46 - with the site
93:48 - not everybody's gonna notice that but
93:50 - some people will and i think they'll
93:52 - appreciate that we might never know
93:54 - about it or hear any compliments about
93:56 - that but
93:57 - um
93:58 - i i think it'll be it'll be fun
94:10 - let's see
94:27 - okay harshit is responding to john
94:29 - hanson's question about uh caching
94:32 - uh and it's talking about
94:34 - um
94:36 - there's a way with webpack to automatic
94:38 - automatically change file names
94:40 - uh so yes that's
94:42 - pretty much what i was doing before with
94:44 - gulp but you can also do it with webpack
94:53 - hey quincy's here so quincy larson uh
94:56 - was in the the chat not sure if he's
94:58 - still here but he was here at one point
95:00 - uh if you don't know who quincy is um he
95:03 - is the the founder and head of free code
95:05 - camp so without quincy none of this
95:07 - would would be going on
95:09 - uh it's always a pleasure when quincy
95:12 - gets to check out some of the uh the
95:14 - live stream so
95:17 - i remember when free code camp first
95:19 - started up uh just thinking like what an
95:21 - awesome guy quincy was for starting this
95:23 - so
95:24 - uh i'm still a little bit starstruck
95:27 - whenever quincy's in the in the live
95:30 - chat
95:46 - uh rhaego says you fixed the bugs in
95:48 - your stomach yeah
95:50 - for sure honestly you know what i think
95:52 - it was
95:52 - i
95:54 - most of you probably don't care about my
95:55 - health problems but
95:57 - i didn't drink any water today
96:00 - i had in a double espresso
96:03 - and then i had at the christmas party
96:05 - some old wine and a root beer
96:08 - and i ate a bunch of food and cookies
96:11 - and
96:12 - i think that was just what killed my
96:14 - stomach so before the stream i drank
96:16 - some water
96:17 - and once that got through my system i
96:20 - think that's what would help maybe i was
96:22 - a bit dehydrated and had too much sugar
96:28 - so i feel like my kids when i tell them
96:30 - like
96:31 - you know don't have too much sugar
96:32 - you'll get a bellyache
96:34 - well that's actually true it happened to
96:36 - me today
96:41 - all right let's see
96:44 - poisoned asked how often are these live
96:46 - streams
96:48 - i i do try to do them
96:50 - every day monday through friday
96:52 - sometime around 2 p.m eastern time give
96:55 - or take an hour or two
96:58 - i don't always do them 5 days a week
97:00 - though
97:01 - frequently i end up having meetings or i
97:04 - might take a day off and i can't really
97:06 - stream from my house because the the
97:08 - internet connection is not fast enough
97:10 - there
97:12 - so
97:14 - anyway ideally my goal is five days a
97:16 - week
97:18 - so that's what i try for but usually
97:19 - it's less than that
97:23 - uh samson says i have missed a lot in
97:25 - the past few days but luckily i am back
97:28 - i'll be following the streams awesome
97:30 - glad to have you back samson
97:34 - all right quincy says great practical
97:35 - advice thanks quincy i really appreciate
97:37 - that
97:41 - all right um
97:45 - very sorry if i mispronounced this name
97:47 - i'm going to try my best let me know how
97:49 - it's supposed to be pronounced if i mess
97:51 - it up so it looks like
97:54 - it
97:56 - it just
97:57 - john
98:00 - all right so it looks like it's i l y o
98:03 - s j o n
98:05 - i'm not sure how to pronounce that so
98:07 - apologies for that please let me know
98:09 - how it's supposed to be pronounced
98:10 - anyway um they say hey there jesse you
98:14 - have uh given the best advice right now
98:16 - thanks
98:17 - i really appreciate that uh thanks i try
98:20 - my best i don't think i'm always right i
98:23 - might not be right even most of the time
98:25 - but
98:26 - uh i i try to do the best i can
98:43 - oh okay so
98:45 - so john hanson's saying you set rem on a
98:48 - div sorry we're we skip back to the
98:50 - conversation about pixels versus rem
98:53 - versus em uh so
98:56 - so like on a container div like the html
98:58 - or the body you set the rem then
99:02 - uh using media queries you set
99:07 - um
99:09 - you you set with with em
99:16 - and then they'll change relative to the
99:18 - width of the screen
99:21 - and he says it works great okay like i
99:23 - said i'm gonna have to do like test that
99:25 - out a bit
99:26 - and maybe i'll go through a tutorial or
99:28 - something
99:30 - and maybe we can try it out when we do
99:34 - uh we're gonna have to do a lot of
99:35 - different templates for different types
99:37 - of of pages so maybe on the next
99:39 - template we do hopefully i can learn
99:41 - enough about it that we can use it then
99:43 - that might be fun to try to do and then
99:45 - compare
99:46 - and then you all can see what it's like
99:48 - to do one or the other and how hard it
99:50 - was to implement one or the other and
99:51 - then what the results look like
100:07 - okay so ar asks why is synchronous
100:09 - functions bad practice
100:12 - um
100:14 - or in industry practice
100:17 - all right let's
100:20 - i'm gonna see if someone else answered
100:21 - that first so i don't say the same thing
100:32 - okay so ar i'm gonna do my best to
100:35 - answer this question
100:36 - i'm going to say right now i i don't
100:38 - know if i'll do a good job here um
100:42 - as i'm somewhat confused about the
100:44 - question
100:45 - uh because of that that second comment
100:47 - um
100:48 - so what i'm thinking is the question is
100:51 - really why are synchronous functions
100:53 - industry practice
100:55 - um
100:57 - well in regard to javascript at least um
101:02 - let me think
101:05 - i'm gonna mess this
101:07 - i'm gonna mess this up um
101:10 - at this point i'm wondering if i should
101:12 - just say i don't know enough or i should
101:14 - try to give this question a shot
101:16 - um how about this if you're still
101:19 - watching could you clarify your question
101:21 - just a bit
101:22 - uh because i'm not sure if you're asking
101:24 - why is synchronous functions an industry
101:26 - practice
101:28 - or why are synchronous functions a bad
101:30 - practice so let me know that and then
101:33 - maybe i'll try to answer that
101:55 - uh rhaego says for the record i'm 28 and
101:57 - i've been knowing web dev stuff since i
101:59 - was 16.
102:01 - that's awesome yeah you've had a nice
102:03 - run of it so far
102:14 - uh i'm going to try to say this name lei
102:17 - tala frey say i'm not sure it's not
102:21 - l-a-i-t-a-l-a-f-r-a-i-s-e
102:27 - uh if you let me know what the best way
102:28 - to pronounce that is i'll be sure to
102:30 - pronounce it correctly from now on
102:32 - um
102:33 - anyway they say yes please do more
102:35 - beginner streams awesome
102:38 - i'll keep that in mind so once again
102:39 - please let me know in the chat or in
102:41 - some other way
102:43 - whether or not you like these type of
102:45 - beginner style streams if you'd like to
102:47 - see more of them
102:48 - uh or just you know general kind of
102:51 - advice on on that kind of thing
102:54 - particularly about what what i can do to
102:56 - help out beginners
103:03 - reiko says css is love css is life
103:07 - i remember when i was first learning
103:08 - html i'd style my pages using tables oh
103:12 - yeah
103:13 - i i remember that i remember when i
103:15 - first learned html i actually i learned
103:18 - html in css long before i actually
103:21 - started doing real web dev stuff uh so
103:24 - back in
103:26 - i don't know like the early 2000s tables
103:29 - were
103:30 - kind of what i learned with
103:33 - i'm glad we moved on from there
103:35 - i still occasionally have to work on
103:38 - some old site that uses tables and uh
103:40 - ever they're always like well can you
103:42 - make this responsive
103:44 - as soon as i see its tables i'm like oh
103:46 - it's always kind of a pain
103:59 - uh veronique says
104:01 - he has too much sugar jesse now you have
104:03 - my stomach hurting
104:06 - that was i feel so silly that it was
104:08 - like i ate too much sugar and i didn't
104:10 - drink any water like i'm a grown person
104:13 - like i should know better than that
104:20 - oh harshit has some answers about those
104:23 - uh synchronous functions so
104:26 - uh harsh it says synchronous functions
104:27 - actually block the code execution which
104:29 - slows down the application in an async
104:32 - function everything is fired
104:33 - simultaneously so execution is faster
104:37 - so
104:38 - that's kind of a good breakdown between
104:39 - the two i'm still kind of looking for a
104:41 - little bit more explanation in the the
104:43 - first question that ar asked
104:46 - but
104:47 - uh even if we don't get that horizon
104:49 - thank you for um for clarifying that
104:54 - um harshit says jesse i have a question
104:57 - uh how easy is it for me to get a job
105:00 - considering my current skill set
105:02 - honestly harshit um
105:05 - i think you have great skills
105:07 - you've been such a help in all of these
105:10 - projects that we've been working on
105:12 - um
105:14 - if i could hire you to do back-end stuff
105:16 - here at the university i'd hire you
105:17 - right now
105:18 - um
105:19 - so i think you've got a great shot at
105:21 - getting a job you have a good portfolio
105:23 - you have a lot of pull requests that
105:25 - have been accepted for these projects so
105:27 - you have a lot to show that you know
105:29 - what you're doing
105:30 - um so
105:33 - i mean i know you're young you're only
105:34 - 16.
105:36 - so that's probably going to be an issue
105:37 - depending on what country you're trying
105:39 - to get a job in
105:41 - but
105:43 - that's really the only issue that i
105:45 - could see
105:46 - you know that i'm not sure about is is
105:48 - just simply the age thing
105:50 - um i mean i know like in the united
105:52 - states you can definitely work at 16
105:53 - it's fine but would a company be
105:55 - comfortable hiring someone who's 16 for
105:58 - like a full-time job
106:00 - probably not at least not here in the
106:02 - united states
106:04 - so
106:06 - but i i think
106:09 - potentially freelance might be a better
106:11 - route for you to go or eat better yet
106:16 - because because of your
106:18 - okay i should say i'm not getting a job
106:20 - now i'm at school okay so assuming that
106:22 - you're out of school later on you're
106:24 - older
106:25 - i don't think
106:27 - with your current skill set
106:29 - and assuming that you're going to
106:30 - improve your skills as well which i'm
106:32 - sure you will
106:33 - i think that you'll have a great time
106:35 - getting a job
106:38 - you'll have an easy time finding a job
106:41 - uh so
106:43 - i think the key thing will be just
106:45 - making sure that you get your work out
106:47 - there to companies to see because if
106:49 - they can see it
106:51 - i think they'll be impressed i'm always
106:53 - impressed with the work that you do
106:55 - so
106:57 - yeah when you get out of school make
106:59 - sure you let me know and if there's any
107:01 - way that i can hire you for something i
107:03 - probably will
107:04 - uh i don't know if i'll be in a position
107:06 - to do that but if i'm in a position to
107:08 - give you a recommendation or something
107:10 - i'd definitely do it
107:12 - so
107:14 - anyway um just keep adding on to your
107:16 - portfolio you know keep doing what
107:19 - you're doing with contributing to open
107:21 - source projects you know it seems like
107:23 - you're already doing all the things that
107:25 - people say will help you get a job
107:28 - uh so i would say just keep on
107:30 - with what you're doing
107:32 - and um
107:35 - like i said i think
107:37 - it won't be that hard and when it comes
107:38 - time for looking for a job
107:40 - um
107:41 - let me know i'd be happy to help you out
107:44 - you know check out your resume and stuff
107:46 - and give you some advice
107:49 - i've been on both sides of things i've
107:50 - been the person getting interviewed and
107:52 - i've been the person doing interviews
107:54 - for developer jobs so
107:56 - that's not a bad perspective to have you
107:58 - know being on both sides of that uh so
108:02 - you know i'd be happy to give you
108:04 - insight into that when the time comes
108:22 - uh
108:23 - let's see
108:24 - the hopeless brit says our website
108:26 - design teacher made us
108:28 - use frames
108:30 - slash iframes or something along those
108:33 - lines to lay out our sites this is back
108:35 - in 2015 oh wow
108:37 - um
108:39 - i was with you until you said 2015 so
108:43 - i remember learning frames also in the
108:46 - early 2000s with tables
108:49 - 2015
108:53 - i will say this normally like web design
108:55 - courses at the high school and college
108:57 - level are usually behind the times when
109:00 - it comes to the latest stuff so
109:04 - um
109:06 - yeah so if i were doing a site now i
109:08 - would definitely not use frames
109:10 - i would not use iframes
109:12 - for the layout
109:13 - but it was done like that at one point
109:21 - all right so alberto has some more info
109:23 - about this synchronous uh asynchronous
109:25 - function thing
109:26 - so uh umberto says each type has their
109:29 - own uses it depends on whether the
109:31 - function calls are dependent on each
109:33 - other
109:34 - uh in some if not most cases you do not
109:36 - need calls to be fully executed before
109:38 - the rest of the code runs
109:40 - so you would want async calls uh for all
109:43 - of them to run at the same time
109:45 - you would want to use synchronous calls
109:47 - though to make sure that one function
109:49 - runs completely before the next
109:51 - okay that makes sense
109:53 - um umberto says i presume async would be
109:57 - industry standard because most function
109:58 - calls can be run simultaneously all
110:01 - right that's that's a great answer it's
110:03 - very informative
110:05 - thanks humberto
110:10 - uh christian says hello i've been
110:12 - following your live stream since august
110:14 - and i'm learning a lot specifically on
110:16 - react js your videos are some of my
110:19 - go-to resources awesome thank you so
110:22 - much for saying that christian uh
110:25 - i i'm gonna tell you i got a comment
110:27 - uh a really positive comment on twitter
110:30 - earlier and i always get positive
110:31 - comments in the live chat i just wanna
110:33 - say i really really appreciate it when
110:36 - you all have comments like that i
110:38 - certainly don't mind criticism too uh
110:40 - you know i i always i'm trying to get
110:41 - better so criticism is fine but really
110:44 - positive comments like that help me to
110:46 - keep going you know they
110:48 - when i see stuff like that it's like
110:51 - i think you know what you you are really
110:53 - helping people you got to keep going
110:55 - this stream
110:56 - and it keeps me going i really
110:58 - appreciate it
111:00 - so um so thank you christian and thank
111:03 - you everyone who's given uh me a lot of
111:06 - positive encouragement i really really
111:08 - appreciate it
111:14 - let's see
111:18 - all right so that uh french sounding
111:21 - name that i couldn't pronounce actually
111:23 - means strawberry milk in french
111:25 - so
111:27 - i guess let me know how to pronounce
111:29 - that in french otherwise is it cool if i
111:31 - just call you strawberry milk because
111:33 - that's easier for me to say
111:38 - but i'd be happy to pronounce it
111:39 - properly
111:40 - if i can figure it out
111:46 - carlos says i moved away for a few years
111:48 - from web development i'd like to know
111:49 - how to upgrade myself and learn the
111:51 - current tools
111:53 - um carlos i just say
111:56 - check out it depends on how you like to
111:58 - learn
112:00 - if you're if you like videos there's a
112:02 - ton of stuff on youtube just make sure
112:04 - with videos you're watching are fairly
112:06 - new
112:07 - um check out some stuff on what's called
112:09 - es6 or es
112:11 - 2015
112:14 - for some of the latest javascript stuff
112:16 - you can go beyond it and even check out
112:17 - es7 eight you know all that stuff but at
112:20 - least ex es6 for some of the newer
112:22 - things that are happening in javascript
112:24 - if you want to check out some of the
112:25 - newer frameworks you know check out
112:26 - react check out vue
112:28 - um this that would be my advice now i'm
112:31 - not exactly sure where you
112:34 - moved away and what you're working on in
112:36 - terms of web development
112:38 - um
112:39 - so
112:41 - i guess that would kind of depend on
112:42 - that but uh
112:45 - i guess it shouldn't be too hard to get
112:47 - back in like i said depending on what
112:48 - you were doing before
112:50 - um
112:51 - i personally kind of think that videos
112:53 - might be the best way to go
112:56 - uh with that just to kind of see what
112:58 - other people are doing
112:59 - uh but there's certainly a ton of blog
113:02 - posts out there that can help you out as
113:03 - well
113:08 - let's see
113:13 - the hopeless spirit says yeah it was a
113:15 - shame at the time none of us knew any
113:17 - better about frames and iframes looking
113:19 - back i shouldn't have just trusted our
113:20 - teachers and gone along with it yeah
113:22 - that's a really tough thing you know
113:23 - like you want to trust your teachers
113:25 - know what they're doing but there's
113:26 - really not a whole lot of incentive
113:28 - especially at the university level for
113:30 - professors to keep up to date right if a
113:32 - professor has tenure you know they
113:34 - really can't get fired unless they do
113:36 - something crazy so
113:38 - you know they have to keep up with all
113:40 - the meetings and paperwork and grading
113:42 - um
113:44 - where's the incentive for them to really
113:46 - stay up to date because you can only
113:47 - really stay up to date on things if
113:49 - you're actually working on projects you
113:51 - know they don't have time to do that
113:53 - so it's it's much easier for them to
113:56 - keep doing what they've been doing right
113:57 - they don't want to have to redo all
113:59 - their lesson plans and stuff every
114:01 - single semester to stay up to date
114:04 - right or even like what's the current
114:06 - best practice at the beginning of a
114:07 - semester might change by the end of the
114:09 - semester you know this field changes way
114:11 - too fast for the current you know way
114:13 - that colleges are set up
114:15 - to keep up
114:17 - so
114:18 - here at this university at franciscan
114:20 - university i'm trying to work with the
114:22 - computer science department to find a
114:24 - solution to that
114:27 - so i have done a guest lecture and we
114:29 - i'm hopefully going to maybe team teach
114:31 - a course
114:32 - so that the
114:34 - computer science professor can handle a
114:36 - lot of the basic the testing grading
114:38 - paperwork and a lot of the basics that
114:40 - don't change of web development and then
114:42 - i can come in and my part will be to get
114:45 - the students up to date on stuff i'm
114:48 - working on and what the latest is in the
114:50 - industry i think something like that
114:52 - where you have a collaboration with
114:54 - someone that's actually in the industry
114:56 - working would be the ideal situation for
114:59 - computer science students at the
115:00 - university level
115:02 - so anyway
115:05 - um
115:06 - i totally understand where you're coming
115:08 - from i actually dropped my
115:10 - web development course in college
115:11 - because of that very issue
115:14 - um
115:15 - i'm gonna have to wrap things up soon my
115:17 - wife's texting me asking me where i am
115:19 - i'm gonna need to go home soon
115:21 - uh so
115:24 - anyway that's kind of a tough thing you
115:26 - learn a lot of good things in a computer
115:28 - science program but you often don't
115:30 - learn a lot of new cutting edge things
115:36 - all right
115:44 - harshit says jesse what happened uh to
115:46 - the electron project you didn't even
115:48 - create the repo i thought i did create
115:50 - the repo
115:51 - where'd it go
115:54 - let's check it out
115:56 - github
116:08 - hmm
116:13 - did i never push that to github
116:15 - let's check out if you have more calm
116:28 - oh i'm sorry
116:31 - you know what i i'm not gonna be able to
116:32 - do it today because i gotta leave uh and
116:35 - go watch the baby but
116:37 - tomorrow i'm gonna do my best to
116:39 - remember to go back in i had thought
116:41 - that i had pushed that repo uh to get
116:44 - him
116:45 - evidently i didn't
116:47 - so um i will definitely do that
116:50 - uh at this week some point thank you for
116:53 - bringing that up harsha really really
116:54 - sorry about that um
116:57 - i just totally thought that i had done
116:59 - it already
117:00 - um
117:02 - let's see
117:05 - um
117:06 - at it says i stopped coding on free code
117:08 - cam months back because of my exams now
117:10 - i don't know where to start from i was a
117:12 - challenge 258 and now i've forgotten
117:14 - half the things
117:16 - uh added i the new curriculum
117:19 - is going to come out soon i think
117:21 - sometime this month so maybe if you want
117:23 - to just wait till that comes out and
117:25 - then start from the beginning again
117:27 - there might be a lot of new stuff
117:29 - uh that's what i would do if i was
117:31 - thinking about starting right now
117:33 - i would wait a week or two to see if the
117:35 - new curriculum was going to come out and
117:38 - then
117:39 - maybe try from there
117:41 - and if you really want to do some things
117:43 - now you know you can go back through and
117:45 - do some of the other problems if you
117:47 - want just to you know stay up on things
117:50 - but
117:52 - that new curriculum should be coming out
117:54 - really soon
117:58 - harsh it says it's 3 30 a.m now i have
118:00 - to sleep immediately otherwise mom will
118:02 - scold me hard waking that late if she's
118:05 - awake harshit
118:06 - yeah for sure go to sleep i do not want
118:08 - you to get in trouble uh with your mom
118:11 - i'll do my best to keep my streams
118:13 - earlier in the day for you
118:22 - all right so i really have to go now or
118:24 - my wife is going to be upset with me
118:27 - so
118:29 - thank you so much everyone this was a
118:30 - great stream
118:32 - really great discussion and questions uh
118:35 - i'm i'm gonna try to do another stream
118:36 - tomorrow a little earlier in the day uh
118:39 - for all of you over uh in in india i
118:41 - know it was really late for you watching
118:43 - i know we have quite a few people from
118:45 - india that watch uh and from that time

118:48 - so
118:49 - it'll be earlier tomorrow
118:51 - but until then have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to work on some more html and css we're just going to continue on with what we were doing yesterday did make a few adjustments yesterday mainly in the javascript so i'll briefly go over uh what we've done harshit helped out a lot with that and then we'll get right into it uh probably gonna be about an hour and a half for this stream uh we'll see i actually haven't been feeling that well so my stomach hurts really bad i have no idea why so if it gets like worse then maybe i'll end the stream but for now i think i'm okay to stream um let me see we may have i keep trying to get one of my coworkers to come in on the stream she's just starting out with coding and i thought it would be cool since we're doing beginner stuff if she would come in and ask questions too but she said she's too tired so we'll see we'll see if she comes um also my camera keeps stopping um so i don't know i can get it turned back on uh i'm just gonna have to keep an eye on it and make sure that it's it's still going so just to just heads up if my screen just freezes like it did just now then i need to restart it yeah so all of a sudden my fan will start going really fast and my camera shuts off i don't know why that's happening all right so let's switch over to the code and see what's going on here let me check the live chat quickly just to say hello uh looks like oh harshit wrote a blog today uh about graphql so it's really cool uh harshit's blog is hp techblogs.com so check that out if you want to read some of his blogs hey everybody um all right oh cool um ethan said great holiday sweater yeah i actually have two holidays let me show you all this other holiday sweater i got i should have done it when i had the camera on full so here i'll switch it back really quickly so we had a white elephant uh christmas gift exchange so uh at my my office today and i got this women's christmas sweater vest so i was wearing it around earlier i have a picture of me with it on on my instagram now because it actually fits me evidently women's size medium is the perfect size for me so i think i'll probably give it to my wife though let's see also i do want to mention since ethan's here in the live chat so ethan did a um a stream two days ago i think it was two days ago um he went through a bunch of the new es6 challenges for free code camp and um went through them all solved them uh wrote the tests uh so it was really cool i i watched some of the stream live and i watched some of the recording of it as well and you did a great job ethan so uh anyway if you haven't checked that out already i think it's really cool and it's a good overview if you would like to contribute to any of the free code camp challenges then you know check out that video and just to get a perspective of how someone else contributes and then maybe it will give you a good idea if that's something you'd like to do uh andrew says uh is also learning graphql alongside gatsby intimidating at first but it seems really powerful uh yeah definitely though that was what i thought about it at first uh if you're not using graphql already check it out we've done some streams about it you can go back and watch those uh we'll be doing more streams with graphql later on but now that i've used it i don't ever want to use anything else so if you're using maybe rest apis right now check out graphql it's it's worth learning all right um ethan said thank you so much you're welcome no problem all right um hey vernice here i do okay so uh vernique says hey jesse hope you remember me from nashville in november i was the one you're helping with the bookstore project i'm still learning yeah for sure i remember i was just wondering recently how you were doing with the project um so i don't know what yeah i don't remember just like out of nowhere i was thinking hey did she ever finish that project but anyway thanks so much uh for uh for coming on and checking out the stream all right let's yeah let me get started okay you're still working on it vernee cool you'll have to um if you can i'd love to check out the project once it's finished so i know there was some of the api you're trying to hit was uh you could only access it from a certain place so i don't know if you if i could see a working version of it but if it's possible that would be kind of cool if you're up for it okay so let me get started and let me start my pomodoro cycle if you haven't watched before i kind of break the stream up into several pomodoro sessions so we do 25 minutes of code we take a five minute break and i answer some of your questions in the live chat and we do another 25 minute session and then after that the whole second half of the stream is all just answering questions in the live chat so be patient if you ask a question and i will get to it at some point during the stream all right so let me switch back so you all can see the code so very quickly let me show you what i've done and what hardship has done in terms of correcting the problem we were having yesterday so if you remember yesterday we had um the deed let me bring let it bring over the website so you all can see it it's on my other screen now i have too many screens open sorry still trying to find it there we go okay so yesterday we were having problems where these were all um like drop downs right they were hidden by default you had to click on details to get them to show so obviously we solved that problem right it you can see everything by default so here's how we did that so harshit submitted a pull request yesterday and uh went through let me make this a bit bigger i'm gonna hide this on the side make it bigger and we don't need this right now so i'm going to shrink it and let me know if that's not big enough for the font size i can make it even bigger uh let me get okay let's um someone asked about ngrok so let me give give you that link i think i still have the server on from yesterday i never yeah i do so i never turned it off so here's the link so you can check out the site live as we're working on it and um if you want let me give you the the ending so this is where we're at so if you want to paste that onto the end of the link that's what page we're on the program i'm using as my editor is visual studio code it's for microsoft and it is free uh let's see oh harshit says that i can remove this globalx content that was for testing all right cool thanks yeah i wasn't sure why that was in there uh but it worked with it in there and um i've been harsh it's been working with me on these projects for long enough that i i trust that that was okay to have in there so anyway i left it in we'll take it out now so basically it's just using a regular expression here um and then it's replacing it with in this case a div that's class of details and then a closing div so i had to change a little bit so the problem i was having originally was that there were some other tags that had the word details in the tag and it was catching those tags as well and it was changing it so it has some really weird things happening with the html so what i did was included the entire tag so in the opening and closing brackets and then here i included the slash as well so i have you see i have a two two different slashes here the first one tells the first one basically means whatever i type next uh you know treat it as part of what i'm looking for you know because normally the slash would have a special meaning in a regular expression but in this case i i actually want to search for a tag that has that slash in there okay so um the g means global so we're gonna try to find every instance of that uh so anyway that's that's really the only changes i made uh from what uh what horseshit had done and that that works also in our css which we'll be working mainly in our css now i added this right column blogs and the br tag to our list of things not to display because there were some really weird positioning things going on because of these two this was an element that had a lot of stuff in it but it was all empty but those things are still taking up a lot of space and then there's for some reason wordpress is inserting a ton of breaks so until i figure out how to fix that on the wordpress side of things i just decided to display none for for the you know br tags all right so that's where we are now once once i did that with the br tags though some things got out of place so these were all stacked on top of each other uh now you can see they're side by side they're definitely better stacked on top of each other but instead of adding the the breaks we'll just add some some css to get them positioned properly all right so let's go let's go to our dev tools so i'm going to inspect this and let's move this over to the side and uh the first thing we're going to try to do because i think it'll look um pretty simple uh and clean is we're just going to try to get this all to display properly right in a row and this will be the way we want it to look on a small screen so let's say like on a on a phone screen right so the way we'll probably do this is we'll start with a small screen view get it looking good and then expand and then see what adjustments we should make for a larger screen i guess you could call this like mobile first um so that's the way we're going to do it so today i'd like to you know get these all stacked properly and then get the formatting on this list we need to fix it a bit that's font's too small i don't want it to be bolded so if we can accomplish that today i'll be happy so first things first let's get these stacked i want the title at the top above the image and then i want these items phone number email this link to a cv all stacked so first let's check out this title and probably the easiest way to make them stack will be to do a display block all right so if we do a display block it's stacked right there so what i'm going to do then is just take all of these elements and add display block to them so i'm going to move this off to the side now so i can see it and i'm gonna go back in here and let's add add a few things in so this is all just plain css we're going to add the name name tag there's a lot of custom html tags which is it's valid to do this but it may look a little strange and we also need the phone and email email and let's go cv link now there's another tag here that we're not using right now but some faculty member profiles might have it so i'm going to add it in here and that's a video embed alright so just in case we run into that later on it should be covered by these rules and the last thing we have is center column details and that would be that um this education right here that's the center column details so we'll add that as well all right so now we're going gonna do a display oops display block and let's save that and we'll give it a refresh all right cool so uh now we have this all stacked up hmm well that's interesting i i now remember that we did not do anything uh to make this responsive at the top so we make sure we won't forget that uh so that that's gonna mess with our responsiveness a bit here or being able to test it out properly so i'm gonna just open this a little bit so we can see what's going on here and try to get that fixed probably the next thing i do will be fixing that alright so that's not bad let's look at our spacing we're going to need to add a little bit more spacing here um above education i think we should add some spacing between the image and that phone number maybe a little bit see on this image it doesn't look bad because there's so much white at the top but i think on a different image where there's not so much white this is going to look cramped so let's add maybe you know eight pixels of space here we'll try maybe 16 and that should be okay for this i do want to check the font size on this it looks a little small for me a little smaller than i like let's bring this back over so we can check the font size i guess we have no font size set so is it automatically setting that's odd i guess it's just going to whatever the default is so what i'd like to have let's just see what's uh 16 pixels all right so we were at 16. i thought it was 16 16 is not bad but i'd like to go closer to 18. we'll try 18 on everything um if it looks we'll see how it looks i like to go with a larger font uh you know for readability uh let's see all right so let's go ahead and put in here for for the p tags we want font size to be 18 pixels and that's not going to cover everything uh because we have some things in in other tags but we'll add those as we as we find them uh now let's let's try to add here under our title uh let's let's do it in dev tools so that you know we can see the result so let's go with the margin bottom of let's try eight pixels first and see how that looks actually that's not bad it's hard to see right because of you know the color of that image but i think eight eight works you know what i think is i'd also maybe like to change the the font size i don't know where i here we go so i already had name here before font size 24. let's try 26 for that font size and then we'll go margin bottom eight pixels so we do uh try to follow material design and usually in material design things go in in like eight so you see eight pixels a lot 16 pixels uh as kind of the spacing between things so that that's what i usually start out with 8 16 um 24. i use those values a lot all right so that's fine for that one let's try to do a similar spacing here and this is under a phone uh so let's do whoops accidentally put that on the tag with with all this in here uh which it might not be bad to add some spacing in but i don't think that much spacing is yeah i don't know that i would want that much spacing uh so here on this tag let's go with margin top of yeah let's go eight that's not bad i thought it would be too small but let's just stick with eight for now and yeah we'll stick with eight for now i do want to make sure we have a proper line height for everything too so we'll take care of that in a second so here let's just take this and i'm going to get rid of this font size and i'm going to change this to phone all right you can see right now i have very little organization to the css we may end up converting this and using it like in the component at some point uh or if we do leave it as css you know we'll kind of try to organize it better but for right now it's we don't have a lot so i'm not super worried about organization that may not be the best way to do it but i usually i don't worry about that when i only have a few lines all right so let's do this center column details and we're going to add margin top uh i'm going to try 16 pixels yeah 16 is better okay because we really want to separate that out you know from from this so 16 looks good uh and that heading could maybe be a bit bigger as well so let's try to do the heading um let me add a class for heading let's try to make all those those headings there uh 20 let's let's try 22 pixels all right i'm gonna see this in comparison to the title here um actually i want the title to be larger i'm not sure though that what we've done to the title has actually taken effect yet so uh because we did change that and make it a bit bigger okay but i like that so let's let's check with that this is center column details the center column details is going to get a margin top of 16 pixels and then the header heading yeah it's called a heading right heading is going to get a font size of 22 pixels let's double check to make sure we increased our font size for name and we did all right so i'm going to save that and i'm going to refresh it now so we can see all of our changes okay uh yeah this is still it's still not looking as big as i would like it to be even though we made the font size 26 so let's go let's go with 30 and let me make sure okay i'm not zoomed in all right i'm going to go with 30 for this one because i want it to be obviously you know bigger than these subheadings and i think at 30 you you can get that immediately anything lower than that and it's not uh you have to kind of look at it more closely to tell so let's go with 30. and again if you're just joining me and you haven't watched the streams before please be patient if you've written a question in the live chat i will get to the questions in the live chat uh in just a few minutes i split things up and i do some coding and then i go back to the live chat so i'm in the coding session right now uh and then we'll do some question and answer stuff here in just a little bit all right so let's do that i did notice something with the phone number where i put the wrong thing so i it should have been margin top and i just copied from name and so i got the wrong wrong thing it there we go okay much better let's see i want to make sure our font size change took effect yes font size 18 but it seems like on this we're we're not at font size 18. so let's add in to our font size 18. let's just add in ul's as well and see if that'll cover uh what we want and actually yeah let's let's try to do it here so it looked like there wasn't a font size set at all so we may be able to just cover everything if we put this on main here and then the ones that we specified here should override that let's see if it works that way okay all right not bad now this looks right i'm going to double check though okay it's inherited that yeah let's see if let's see if i took that off okay so that one main didn't really do much okay so i may as well take that off of main since it didn't do anything anyway and it's working on almost everything we just have these so let's see what kind of tag that is oh h6 that's odd okay so uh we're gonna have to override the default size for an h6 so i usually i i don't like to override the h tags as much if i don't have to but in this case obviously we can't have it that small so let's override those h tags and we can try to be specific and say h tags that are just within an li it it probably doesn't matter i'm thinking the only place where we're going to see h6s on the faculty pages are in here um but i i honestly think it'll help me reading this later on to know why exactly i made that change the 86 if i specify here that it was in an li h6 and let's do font size let's make them this should be the same as the headings no we need them to be smaller than the headings let's make these let's let's try 20. okay 20 pixels looks pretty big you know what i don't mind 20 pixels there so i don't really even mind 18 but i do want to take off the the bold so let's you know let's play with the font weight a bit so uh font weight is kind of like the boldness right of the um uh of the font so we're gonna take it through some here 400 is the baseline of what we have everywhere right now all right we could go five did we have five or six let's try five right now and let me take this off yeah it looks like it's six so i don't want six hundred five looks much better and we still have a little distinction there um let's let's check this out i want to see let's see what what it'll look like if we change all these font weights to 300. hmm i actually really like the look of a thinner font i'm going to stake i'm going to keep that thinner font now but definitely want to test this it may not be as readable on on certain screens so i'm gonna kind of tentatively uh keep the font uh font weight at 300. all right so let's add this here as font weight 300 and then our eight sixes as font size would we have that at 20 and then font weight at what was we said 400 yeah okay all right so i'm going to save that give it a refresh to see if anything looks really weird no that looks fine at least on my monitor that font still seems really small i mean is that really 18 it just seems it is really 18. wow there we go all right so line height 1.5 at least for me on my screen makes it seem a lot more readable so let's add that in as well i usually use a line height of 1.5 so that's not bad we'll stick with that actually yeah we'll keep it line height 1.5 okay now my pomodoro timer did go off a minute or two ago so i'm gonna go short five minute break i'm gonna go back to the live chat right now and um i will answer as many questions as i can also just notice that my camera shut off so i'm gonna get that camera started again there we go i guess it doesn't really matter if you all can see me so not a big deal i'm going to leave it on this screen so i can see my timer and i'm going to scroll up see what questions i missed nino says do you think php is a good language because there's a big gap in that field and a big opportunity to make something um it my feeling on uh programming languages is you can build good things and terrible things with any programming language so i personally don't have as much fun building things in php i enjoy javascript more so there are certain languages that i personally like more than others just because of my experience with it how good i am with those languages you know the amount of syntax that it takes right like python just seems more fun to me than php uh just because of the syntax right but it does depend on your exposure so i would say if you enjoy using php and you can get a job with it then use php i don't really know any of the statistics as to whether or not jobs and php are growing or shrinking or anything like that but you might want to look into that as well uh if you're trying to plan out you know what you want to do for your career another good thing to keep in mind is it's not that hard to switch from one program programming language to another so even if you decide to specialize in one now you could always change it up later on you know if you know if things shift you know you gotta you know you have to learn what you need you know for your job be able to support yourself and your family pay the bills oh okay harsha's irish it says uh and this was a little while ago it said it's it's 1 30 pm there so he's really sleepy yeah uh i'm sorry am i am um yeah harshit if um if you if you need to go to sleep by all means go to sleep i only i just had to start later today because uh we had a christmas party here at the office so i'll i'll try to make sure i don't stream this late usually let's see uh harshit recommends moving the css to a style jsx tag so that it may be scoped and nonrender blocking and splitted it will also give live reloading or should i think i will move it into a tag like that for these videos since i i wanted to take this opportunity to do some videos that would be as easy as possible for beginners to understand i decided to use the css file but you're you're completely right we will get some benefits from moving it into our component with the style.jsx tag so if if you don't know much about react and you didn't understand what we i was just talking about don't worry about it it's it's just a certain way you could do something when working with react so you don't need to worry about it unless you really want to learn react uh let's see sergio says hello i'm new here is he doing some kind of free code camp challenges i'm not doing the challenges right now in this stream i actually work on the projects that i need to for my job as a frontend developer i work for a small university and so we're redoing the main website for our university and so that's what i'm working on right now i'm working on a template that's going to display all the faculty members here at the university uh moises asks what are those colors on the number column um i'm not sure i'm not exactly sure what you're asking like what number column you're asking about so if you can if you're still watching uh could you give me some hints as to what number column you're talking about i'm sure if i would have saw your comment while i was doing it it would have been obvious but now after the fact i can't remember what i was doing that would have a number column uh so anyway i'd love to answer your question just need a little bit more info if possible please uh okay so i'm going to go back to the coding for a bit and then i'll come back in the live chat so if i didn't get to your question yet stick around for a little while if you can and i will get to your question if for some reason you can't stick around i'll still answer your question later on and you can always watch the recording of this video uh and uh hear the answer to your question uh you know whatever time you feel like watching the recording okay so let's start this up uh we'll do one more pomodoro session let's see okay i think we're good i do need to make sure that i'm home in time uh to watch the baby so my wife is and most of my kids are gonna go christmas caroling at a nursing home but uh my youngest cordelia who's one and a half almost um she was sick last night so obviously we don't want her going to nursing home she might get you know the people that are sick so i'm gonna stay home with her but that means i have to make sure i'm home from work and enough time for for them to get over to the nursing home all right so let's see what we want to do now all right so we have everything in a column the spacing is not bad it's not perfect let's see what we can do about it all right it looks like we need less spacing between education and this first bullet point we need to make education as a header and these we need to make them the same it looks like something's off in here so maybe it's i think it's the weight uh so we'll have to match the font weight so i think this is 400 and this looks like 300. so let's match those font weights and then let's change the yeah it's it's going to be slight but i definitely think there's less spacing here so we're going to change that up a bit and then we'll move on and we'll work on the spacing down here okay so first things first let's see what tag this is so this is a heading heading tag and i think if we put font weight 400 yep that should do it for the font weight and then let's do a margin bottom uh let's let's see where we're at let's do a zero first all right so we don't really have yeah we have nothing there right now what's giving us that space there we go it's it's inside of a paragraph tag that's our problem let's see what we can do where is this paragraph tag you know what we probably don't even originally have a paragraph tag it's just wordpress is adding this in here for us all right we can we can select just this paragraph tag and let's do that here just to test it out and let's go with the margin oops bottom of zero that didn't even move it up did it now it's making no difference interesting that's really odd okay well i guess we won't worry about that let's take this off there now and well in this case i think we're just gonna have to do a negative margin if we can here uh so let's find where are we at so we gotta go inside this p tag again and let's find this let's go with the center column details and let's add our margin onto this so let's go margin oops margin bottom of let's go with a negative eight pixels and now i'm gonna have to i'm gonna eyeball this a bit for now if we can get it close i'll be all right with that that looks pretty close i'm gonna leave it at that for now because that's yeah that's really really close okay so we're going to add a margin bottom of 8 to our center column details and then we're also going to add that uh where is it at heading we're going to add that font size or i'm sorry font weight 400 all right wonderful all right now let's go down hey did that not work let's inspect it all right it's being overridden which is okay so let's go in here and just make it a bit more specific um so i'm just gonna put this inside of the p for now i know that will work it should have worked oops i added pixels on the end all right so i may not even need this now uh it's supposed to just be 400 not 400 pixels that's my problem all right great that works okay let's check out the spacing here i'm most worried about the space between these uh this should be a lot closer since this description goes with this of heading here so let's find our h6 and we're going to want to remove most of that bottom margin so we can see we have a 46.6 uh down here so it's the margin is probably a em yeah so we have an em value uh let's try to make it let's just go right here with our six let's go margin bottom let's give it eight pixels oh i like that yeah i like that a lot okay and actually let's go with the margin top of 16 pixels yeah much better much better hmm you know what i may even wanna let's increase this to 24 and let's bump this down all right so something else is messing it up it's it should be all right let's figure out what else is messing this up okay so on these p tags uh we also have a margin at the top here which in this case i think a negative margin is going to be the easiest way for us to go instead of trying to select these p tags and not affect some of the other ones so let's go back on that h6 and let's go with that margin bottom and let's take it negative and 12 looks not bad yeah 12 is not bad on these headings i'd like to have a little bit more space though uh above each one all right so let's first put this in see uh see you can see the value now uh especially if you're just starting out the value of using devtools of being able to immediately just kind of adjust your changes and then you can just copy and paste them right over into here you know just quickly hit save and then a refresh on your browser just to double check that everything worked and there you know just kind of line by line you can test your uh your styles and you know we've kind of made quick work of of this page and cleaned it up quite a bit and we have like a really nice tight feedback loop you know like immediately we can see the changes so it can at least for me it you know really helps save a lot of time you know being able to you know do things like this okay i want to now add a margin on the top of these headings sorry for the yawn okay margin top 16 no it's not working why is it not working all right so let's let's go up a bit here to these right column details and let's add it on right column details margin top 16 pixels um that's not working either all right let's add it to the bottom then see if we can make it work on the bottom all right this is odd i'm not able to change the margins and padding here why can i not do that all right i know i've run into things like this before and i can't really remember oops you know what maybe um ah that's why i chose the wrong wrong thing okay let's try this again we want center column details uh so let's go with center column details margin bottom let's go 16 pixels there we go that's what we want uh let's try 24 24 pixels okay much better i just wanted to make it more apparent that these headings go with the what's below it all right and not with you know what's above so we have it has messed up this spacing why would i mess up that spacing hmm all right well i like i like this look i'm going to keep this look all right so this does look oh that's why so this was in the center column details as well hmm oh so we already we already had the center column details that we were using and we just overrode that okay all right all right let's take this out let's change this 24. let's see what this looks like okay not bad could use a bit more here uh you know why because this is actually this is right column details okay all right this is what we're running into before where we just had some weird things going on here all right let's see if we can do there we go all right so we had set everything else to display block but not right column details so let's add that to our display block so that's what we needed to be able to make this this margin work so we're going to do that and then we're going to add under right column details this margin top of 24. save that and refresh great all right everything looks uh how we wanted it to look not bad yeah not bad a lot better than what we started with let me check my time here about seven minutes um okay so let's well my camera went off again so let me set reset my camera okay cameras reset and let's think about this let's do um i'm going to try something with the positioning of this this container so this test id content should be the container for all of our content in here uh so i'd like to make a max of 90 percent it's just going to work there we go all right so that'll bring this in a bit and let's try to do a percentage so we want this hmm let's go with let's do some media queries here all right so with this the default is going to be max with and we're going to say 90 percent and then we're going to give it a margin of zero auto which you can use to center uh something that is not everything will center like this but for sure if it's set to display block uh you can center it like this it also has to have a width all right so we're going to do that but then let's add this media query so let's go um media screen and uh let's go um with i'm gonna have to look at the syntax for this i haven't written a media query by hand in a long time media queries there we go okay it is a hyphen uh min width and we're gonna say let's just do 600 pixels for now as i'm in with and then now we're going to say we want the max width to be oh let's say 70 oops forgot to put in the uh yeah let's just copy this so i'm there we go a bit spoiled by sass not having you write as much uh what did i say i wanted that to be 70 yeah let's try 70 for that so i'm going to save that and refresh okay great so it should be 70 percent of the screen width in this case which so you can see it's only taking up 70 percent but as we get down to lower than 600 pixels it changes and now it's taking up 90 of the screen width right because on a smaller device you know we want to be able to show everything we're not as worried about you know screen uh real estate there so that's that's what i wanted i mean there's definitely room for uh adjusting that but that just roughly gives it you know kind of a better look um you know more of a look that we were used to and so let me explain that media query so if you are i i've advertised this stream as being a very good stream for beginners so let me change or let me go through what's what's happened here because this um is if you're just starting out a media query is kind of a somewhat tricky thing to deal with so here's what i've done i've made the default so this simply selects a div that has the attribute the data test id attribute of content okay because we happen to have a div like that so we've selected that div and this would be you know very similar to selecting a div that has a class of content right we've just kind of made up our own attribute there so by default the max width is 90 okay and as i said the zero margin zero auto centers it so the default size is actually the mobile size right once we get the screen bigger once it gets to 600 pixels right so if so basically this is saying the minimum width of the screen that anything within this query uh will work on is 600 pixels so anything below 600 pixels this will be ignored if you're above 600 pixels this will be run it's below this so it will use the cascading nature of cascading stylesheet css and it will go with whatever value this has overriding this value so that's why we didn't have to add margin 0 auto again all right that's not overwritten here just this one so once the screen gets 600 pixels it switches over all right or 600 pixels or more it switches over to max width 70 percent and we could put anything we wanted in here we could make the text size go to 300 if we wanted to on a big screen we could make the background color go green if we wanted to really anything you can reposition elements you know anything that you can do with css you can put inside a media query if you wanted to go the other way around and have this be the base value for a large screen and have whatever's inside the media query only apply on a small screen you just switch it and do max with instead of min with and then with max with what would happen is anything that's above 600 pixels won't have any of this stuff applied to it but if it's below 600 pixels then anything in here will be applied right so these i know were really tricky for me starting out with html and css it took me a long time to get comfortable enough to kind of write my own at first i always just copy and pasted ones that i know worked from other projects and would just kind of adapt those ones you know even now i had to look up the syntax so i got to about here and had to double check and make sure i was doing it right so i've been doing this for years and i still have to look up the syntax so don't feel bad about that but it can be tricky trying to figure out well should i put min or should i put max so it usually takes a lot of practice before you can just remember it and i get confused about it still but anyway that's basically how media queries work they don't have to be with you could set a height sometimes that type of thing helps if you're trying to target like a landscape view on a phone or you know something like that you can set um a width or a height right because some big phones have much larger dimensions than you would normally think so it's it's helpful uh you can target um a lot of other things right so you can actually target orientation so landscape or portrait uh for a phone you can target aspect ratio um i don't really know all the things that you can you can target uh you can make a media query just for print so it'll only work when the user goes to hit print and then you can have print only styles be applied so anyway a lot of cool stuff you can do with that but the most common use i've ever seen for these are for width for responsive layouts so when you hear people talk about responsive uh websites most of the responsiveness comes from these media queries okay there are some things you can do with javascript uh that can also help and some things you can do with setting like percentage widths on items that's very important but you know the magic happens in the media queries okay i went over my time for coding and kind of talked a little bit but i know that was really tricky for me so i wanted to make sure i got a good explanation of that and for all of you hopefully that made sense all right so now we've gone through two pomodoro cycles we've accomplished everything that we wanted to and a little bit more which is great uh i don't think i messed up anything today which is a very rare occurrence so i'm happy and my stomach quit hurting and i feel fine now so all in all this was a really amazing stream today so i'm going to scroll back up to where i left off in the live chat and i'm going to answer all your questions so if you have a question you haven't put it in the chat yet please do so now uh you can also ask me questions on twitter if you like my the link to my twitter account is in the description below this video you can ask questions in the comments to the video uh i'm on all the different social media things so get in touch with me whatever way is most comfortable with you i'd be happy to answer your questions look at some code for you i can't guarantee that i can answer right away but i'll try to get to it as soon as i can all right one benefit of asking the question in the live chat is you not only get my answer which may or may not even be a good answer but you also get the expertise of all the other very talented knowledgeable people that are in the live chat right now so i do recommend that as the number one way uh to ask a question all right 329. okay so i did leave off with uh a question about what are the colors on the number column i'm still not sure what that was referring to so hopefully uh moises i'm hopefully i'm pronouncing that right hopefully moises has clarified later on uh down in the live chat and we'll see that in a minute uh some move on here uh john hanson as a comment says jesse you stated about trusting pixel size and it is absolute though it's a good idea to let others know that rem and em is often a better choice when it comes to responsive design okay yeah that's a really good point um yeah let's let me foreign i'm just double checking it to make sure i'm getting everything in the conversation here about rem and ems um okay so let me address that i do see a lot of people use rem or em the reason i don't use rem or em is because i just don't know enough about them to use them comfortably so i i really uh i have nothing against using them but i know what i do with pixels will work because i've used it before i'm open to learning more about using em instead of pixels as a unit and uh if that is generally the better way to do things then you know i'll i'll try to learn it and i'll try to use that from now on uh but at least for this stream i was definitely not comfortable using that so i guess that's but that's a good disclaimer on this so if you're watching and you're used to using rem or em don't switch up the pixels just because you saw me do it uh i this may not be the best way to do it it is a way to do it and it works but there may be a better way uh so and i think that can go for everything that we do on this stream as well uh i'm definitely just showing one way to do things and that's the way i know how to do it and i'm always trying to learn better ways to do it so if if you think you know a better way to do something please let me know i can't guarantee that i'll start doing it right away because i'll have to learn how to do it first but i'll definitely take it into consideration and try to use it and if you ever want to submit a pull request to one of the projects and use a technique that you think is better feel free don't feel like you have to match what i'm doing all the time i'll review the pull request i'll check it out i might ask you some questions so that i can understand it better and i may end up using your technique in in all my future projects so that certainly happened before uh with people contributing uh pull requests and it just blows my mind and i change the way i do things so anyway uh john hanson thank you for bringing that up and um yeah i wish i could say more about the difference but i i said i'm just not knowledgeable i know uh you john and a few others have brought that up in past streams and uh so i think maybe it's time that i better uh do a little bit of research on that uh no beer says uh jesse i think justifying your paragraph would also be better let's check that out yeah maybe we can yeah maybe we can try that out i'm not going to try it right now on the stream but maybe we have to try that out we'll try later on or maybe on another stream let's see also uh i want you all that are watching let me know what you think about these streams that kind of go over more basics uh because a lot of the streams lately have been going over more advanced things which is fun and challenging but i've noticed that i'm getting a lot of response and a lot of different people watching when i do these beginner type streams so if if you all think that this is beneficial let me know i'll try to work in some beginner stuff you know maybe at least like once a week if i can uh i may not always be able to do it depending on what i'm working on but uh i you know i'd love to be able to you know have these streams be accessible to to a wider uh audience so let me know what you all think about it okay john hanson says rem is a relative base that can be set even with media with at different sizes em is set as em is set uh we'll then change the pixel sizes with the width changes okay that's interesting so basically we could get like a responsive font size with em let me know if that's what you're saying john if i have that right uh i think that's what you're saying and that actually seems really cool so the idea then would be the font size would actually get bigger or smaller depending on our our screen size uh which i really like that um i i love that idea so yeah let me know if i if i'm understanding that correctly please uh yusuf says hey i'm a newbie here and uh newbie decoding so do you think vue is a good option to start uh learning a framework for js um i haven't used vue myself but i've heard a lot of good things about it there's uh people that you know that work as developers that i i respect their work and they use view so i'd say it's probably fine to start out with but i would i would caution um try to learn some of the basics of javascript before you go right into the framework now i'm gonna put a big disclaimer on that right if you need to do projects and get work done so that you can support your family and pay the bills use whatever you can use right uh i totally understand that so if you know you can get a job or clients right now and you need to use vue do it but just while you're doing it remember to keep up you know your studies on normal javascript because that's going to set you up to succeed later on when let's say nobody uses vue anymore you know years down the road well if all you knew was view and you never took the time to learn basic vanilla javascript then it might be a lot harder for you to switch to whatever the new framework is that people are using so if you have time and you're learning try out some regular javascript first before you go into a framework whatever that framework is which view is a good one but if you got to jump into stuff and use vue there's nothing wrong with that just be aware um that that you take a little bit of time to learn you know some of the basics so um i'm open to other opinions on that as well i know i i've heard people have strong opinions before about making sure you learn vanilla javascript and i said assuming you have all the time in the world to just study yeah that's probably a good way to do things but realistically most people don't have that luxury so i'm i'm not gonna you know uh say hey you got to do it like this and make everyone feel bad for not being able to do that so i say try to do it the best way you possibly can within reason you know taking into account your situation let's see oh goodness no beer said it was it was 2 40 a.m uh where he's at and that was that was a while ago so it's probably after 3 a.m now thanks for staying up so late no beer please feel free to go to sleep if you're still awake yeah you can always just catch the end of the stream uh on the you know the recording john hanson has a quick react question which is better axios or fetch for in a simple post to a php mailer i have very limited experience with axios i've seen it in use i can't remember if i've ever actually used it myself but i am a big proponent of using fetch because it's well depending on the browser it's supported it's built in it's going to be more lightweight for you axios is another library you know that you have to learn uh more things you have to bring in i don't know how heavy axios is really so it could be super lightweight it's not an issue but uh i've always gone with fetch so but like i said i don't know enough about axios to really get into pros and cons other than i figure it's it's always better to just use you know whatever the base thing is you know for the browser which in this case is fetch not for every version of every browser but going forward that's i think that's going to be what's what's used so we may as well just use it now unless there's some feature in axios that that you really really need or like uh let's see rhaegal says in all honesty i like php and ruby and whatnot over javascript javascript just seems to do some really silly stuff by comparison and you have to secondguess it a lot in my opinion hey that's totally valid um let me see regal are you the one that asked earlier maybe not uh somebody had asked earlier about whether to learn php or something like that and i think i had mentioned you know it really kind of depends on what you like using so the bottom line is their jobs out there for php developers i mean think of all those wordpress sites out there right as long as wordpress is out there there's always going to be jobs for php developers um and then like ruby there's a lot of ruby sites out there there there's work for people in almost every language uh so find what you really love to to do and do it if you don't really have a preference then maybe you want to look more into well what what companies do i like to work for what do they use uh things like that um but i mean that's just the way it's gonna be yeah some people like chocolate ice cream some people like vanilla some people like strawberry it you know it's it's only natural that the same thing is going to happen with programming languages you know i like javascript i don't really care that much for php but i use it when i have to i don't hate it i just like javascript better um i don't think there's any programming language that i hate you know they just i like javascript better because i've had the most experience with javascript it makes sense to me right so you know when uh regular saying here it javascript seems to do some really silly stuff by comparison it doesn't seem silly to me because i'm used to it right uh so it just all kind of depends on what you're used to doing so there's nothing wrong with you know coding in whatever language you wanted like he said as long as as long as you're cool with it and you can do good things with that then you know go for it a good girl sammy says can you learn coding at 21 years old um yeah you can for sure uh i don't know if if you're asking if 21 is too old or too young to learn to code but i would say 21 is a finance to learn how to code i didn't really start getting into coding you know seriously full time until i was 20 in my late 20s i can't remember how it was exactly so i was in my late 20s um so and i'm an okay coder now uh you all can judge for yourself because i've done enough live streams that i'm not even going to attempt to rank myself as a coder uh it's it's there for everybody to see um but yeah so um if you want to learn coding and you're 21 go for it uh sergio said no you're too old most people start coding at 10. i'm assuming that that's a joke it's being sarcastic from sergio um horizon said but i like axios api more yeah in that case if you really like axios use axios right if axios works you know stick with it let's see uh rook says i'm 26 started less than a year ago um jordan asked if i was doing this in wordpress uh the data is coming from wordpress so i'm running uh what's called a headless uh installation of wordpress so i'm not using any of like the the themes right or the templates for things i'm just using it to be an admin interface for people to store data in a mysql database and then i'm using uh the wp graphql plugin to be able to use graphql to pull the data out and into our react project so what we were just working in is actually react but we were just pulling in a bunch of html and so we were doing it we were using just basic css and not really a more react style of doing css just because of the unique situation that we're in uh with this data so at some point we'd like to convert it all over so we can do it you know a little bit more properly according to the you know best practices with react uh but right now you know we need we just need to make sure that we get it looking good for launch day and uh so that's first priority um you know the other stuff will get pushed back and get can get taken care of after launch let's see uh good girl sammy is i'm just gonna follow this conversation a bit because i think it'll be helpful to uh newer people so good girl sammy says uh rook how long did it take you to learn it uh less than a year um because rickon said uh so rook started last year um let's see harder should ask if uh good girl sammy was starting from scratch um let's see uh john hanson says i just started html css a long time i started just html and css a long time ago but jquery php javascript react at the age of 60. never too old i like that thanks for sharing that john i see a hard caught that i was trying to use pixels on font wait thank you harshit i didn't see it in the live chat but i appreciate you putting it in there okay so good girl sammy is starting from scratch um but has a lot of ideas i just got to learn to code leonardo uh leonardo says what's up how are you doing how you all doing today uh i'm doing pretty pretty well uh now um so how's how you doing thanks for watching all right so poison said i'm glad other people have problems with styling i always thought i was the exception well i don't know about everybody else but i definitely have problems with styling sometimes i actually really love css i know i've heard some developers that are specialized in javascript say they don't like css but um i i still like it i i really like it it's just so easy to make things happen on the screen you know very quickly but it is tricky it's very tricky sometimes stephen says jesse going old school with straight css today yeah definitely uh good girl sammy says i got a question for you if if you got a nice idea for a project should you go to a company or should you try to build it yourself um my my answer to that would just be it depends on if you think you have the skills to be able to build it yourself so if um if you can then why not build it yourself it might be fun you might learn a lot in the process if it's a big idea where you think you know you're definitely going to need help with it or you know maybe a lot of funding then you might want to go to a company but don't really take my word for it i don't have a lot of experience at doing things like that you know sometimes i have ideas and i use them i figure out a way to use them in my my daytoday work so i can work on it i don't really have experience with going to a company and proposing my ideas let's see uh john hanson asks when the production build is deployed to the server why is it that so many things keep the site alive in in cache especially when updating the files is there an easier way around this um john are you asking in general or in particular to the sites that we've been doing on the stream uh in general i know there's there can sometimes be a caching problem uh for instance like a css file might be cached in a user's browser and you can't do anything about it unless you change the name of the css file so there are some things you can get that can automatically change the name every time you update your css file and then you push it changes the references some of my projects the earlier projects were set up with gulp and uh we had it set up to automatically change the references to the files in the production build and change the name of the css so that's one way to get rid of it but otherwise you know all your caching options can definitely be changed if you have caching going on in a server um you know you can you can set all that yourself even if you're using a content delivery network like cloudflare or something you can still go in and you know manually flush the cache so i guess depending on how you set things up you know it can make it harder or easier to get rid of the cash if you make updates but there's always a way to to make that happen uh rook says that shares a lot of fighting the markup you have to do there jesse how excited are you about everything eventually being in the right spot in the database i'm really excited i'm trying not to think about it too much because i know that day is is months away um so i'm i resign myself to the fact that i'm gonna have to fight with the markup for a little while uh but i'm i'm convinced that that is going to be the easier the faster route and we need speed for this project right now so the cool thing is going to be too that when the site comes out it's definitely going to be an obvious improvement over what the current site is so people are going to like it it's going to load a lot faster it's going to be more clean people are going to like it but then a month or two after once we get the data all sorted out we can actually make you know what we have going on now even better um so it's almost i think going to be a good thing because users are going to see this big change and it's going to be so much better and then not that long after that they're going to see these tiny little changes in the different parts of the site as we get the data you know sorted properly and when we do that we pull it in to our react components we're going to style it a bit differently we're going to do it exactly as we would have done it if we had the freedom right now to do it that way all the freedom of the markup so i think it'll be cool for people to see how actively you know we're keeping up with the site not everybody's gonna notice that but some people will and i think they'll appreciate that we might never know about it or hear any compliments about that but um i i think it'll be it'll be fun let's see okay harshit is responding to john hanson's question about uh caching uh and it's talking about um there's a way with webpack to automatic automatically change file names uh so yes that's pretty much what i was doing before with gulp but you can also do it with webpack hey quincy's here so quincy larson uh was in the the chat not sure if he's still here but he was here at one point uh if you don't know who quincy is um he is the the founder and head of free code camp so without quincy none of this would would be going on uh it's always a pleasure when quincy gets to check out some of the uh the live stream so i remember when free code camp first started up uh just thinking like what an awesome guy quincy was for starting this so uh i'm still a little bit starstruck whenever quincy's in the in the live chat uh rhaego says you fixed the bugs in your stomach yeah for sure honestly you know what i think it was i most of you probably don't care about my health problems but i didn't drink any water today i had in a double espresso and then i had at the christmas party some old wine and a root beer and i ate a bunch of food and cookies and i think that was just what killed my stomach so before the stream i drank some water and once that got through my system i think that's what would help maybe i was a bit dehydrated and had too much sugar so i feel like my kids when i tell them like you know don't have too much sugar you'll get a bellyache well that's actually true it happened to me today all right let's see poisoned asked how often are these live streams i i do try to do them every day monday through friday sometime around 2 p.m eastern time give or take an hour or two i don't always do them 5 days a week though frequently i end up having meetings or i might take a day off and i can't really stream from my house because the the internet connection is not fast enough there so anyway ideally my goal is five days a week so that's what i try for but usually it's less than that uh samson says i have missed a lot in the past few days but luckily i am back i'll be following the streams awesome glad to have you back samson all right quincy says great practical advice thanks quincy i really appreciate that all right um very sorry if i mispronounced this name i'm going to try my best let me know how it's supposed to be pronounced if i mess it up so it looks like it it just john all right so it looks like it's i l y o s j o n i'm not sure how to pronounce that so apologies for that please let me know how it's supposed to be pronounced anyway um they say hey there jesse you have uh given the best advice right now thanks i really appreciate that uh thanks i try my best i don't think i'm always right i might not be right even most of the time but uh i i try to do the best i can oh okay so so john hanson's saying you set rem on a div sorry we're we skip back to the conversation about pixels versus rem versus em uh so so like on a container div like the html or the body you set the rem then uh using media queries you set um you you set with with em and then they'll change relative to the width of the screen and he says it works great okay like i said i'm gonna have to do like test that out a bit and maybe i'll go through a tutorial or something and maybe we can try it out when we do uh we're gonna have to do a lot of different templates for different types of of pages so maybe on the next template we do hopefully i can learn enough about it that we can use it then that might be fun to try to do and then compare and then you all can see what it's like to do one or the other and how hard it was to implement one or the other and then what the results look like okay so ar asks why is synchronous functions bad practice um or in industry practice all right let's i'm gonna see if someone else answered that first so i don't say the same thing okay so ar i'm gonna do my best to answer this question i'm going to say right now i i don't know if i'll do a good job here um as i'm somewhat confused about the question uh because of that that second comment um so what i'm thinking is the question is really why are synchronous functions industry practice um well in regard to javascript at least um let me think i'm gonna mess this i'm gonna mess this up um at this point i'm wondering if i should just say i don't know enough or i should try to give this question a shot um how about this if you're still watching could you clarify your question just a bit uh because i'm not sure if you're asking why is synchronous functions an industry practice or why are synchronous functions a bad practice so let me know that and then maybe i'll try to answer that uh rhaego says for the record i'm 28 and i've been knowing web dev stuff since i was 16. that's awesome yeah you've had a nice run of it so far uh i'm going to try to say this name lei tala frey say i'm not sure it's not laitalafraise uh if you let me know what the best way to pronounce that is i'll be sure to pronounce it correctly from now on um anyway they say yes please do more beginner streams awesome i'll keep that in mind so once again please let me know in the chat or in some other way whether or not you like these type of beginner style streams if you'd like to see more of them uh or just you know general kind of advice on on that kind of thing particularly about what what i can do to help out beginners reiko says css is love css is life i remember when i was first learning html i'd style my pages using tables oh yeah i i remember that i remember when i first learned html i actually i learned html in css long before i actually started doing real web dev stuff uh so back in i don't know like the early 2000s tables were kind of what i learned with i'm glad we moved on from there i still occasionally have to work on some old site that uses tables and uh ever they're always like well can you make this responsive as soon as i see its tables i'm like oh it's always kind of a pain uh veronique says he has too much sugar jesse now you have my stomach hurting that was i feel so silly that it was like i ate too much sugar and i didn't drink any water like i'm a grown person like i should know better than that oh harshit has some answers about those uh synchronous functions so uh harsh it says synchronous functions actually block the code execution which slows down the application in an async function everything is fired simultaneously so execution is faster so that's kind of a good breakdown between the two i'm still kind of looking for a little bit more explanation in the the first question that ar asked but uh even if we don't get that horizon thank you for um for clarifying that um harshit says jesse i have a question uh how easy is it for me to get a job considering my current skill set honestly harshit um i think you have great skills you've been such a help in all of these projects that we've been working on um if i could hire you to do backend stuff here at the university i'd hire you right now um so i think you've got a great shot at getting a job you have a good portfolio you have a lot of pull requests that have been accepted for these projects so you have a lot to show that you know what you're doing um so i mean i know you're young you're only 16. so that's probably going to be an issue depending on what country you're trying to get a job in but that's really the only issue that i could see you know that i'm not sure about is is just simply the age thing um i mean i know like in the united states you can definitely work at 16 it's fine but would a company be comfortable hiring someone who's 16 for like a fulltime job probably not at least not here in the united states so but i i think potentially freelance might be a better route for you to go or eat better yet because because of your okay i should say i'm not getting a job now i'm at school okay so assuming that you're out of school later on you're older i don't think with your current skill set and assuming that you're going to improve your skills as well which i'm sure you will i think that you'll have a great time getting a job you'll have an easy time finding a job uh so i think the key thing will be just making sure that you get your work out there to companies to see because if they can see it i think they'll be impressed i'm always impressed with the work that you do so yeah when you get out of school make sure you let me know and if there's any way that i can hire you for something i probably will uh i don't know if i'll be in a position to do that but if i'm in a position to give you a recommendation or something i'd definitely do it so anyway um just keep adding on to your portfolio you know keep doing what you're doing with contributing to open source projects you know it seems like you're already doing all the things that people say will help you get a job uh so i would say just keep on with what you're doing and um like i said i think it won't be that hard and when it comes time for looking for a job um let me know i'd be happy to help you out you know check out your resume and stuff and give you some advice i've been on both sides of things i've been the person getting interviewed and i've been the person doing interviews for developer jobs so that's not a bad perspective to have you know being on both sides of that uh so you know i'd be happy to give you insight into that when the time comes uh let's see the hopeless brit says our website design teacher made us use frames slash iframes or something along those lines to lay out our sites this is back in 2015 oh wow um i was with you until you said 2015 so i remember learning frames also in the early 2000s with tables 2015 i will say this normally like web design courses at the high school and college level are usually behind the times when it comes to the latest stuff so um yeah so if i were doing a site now i would definitely not use frames i would not use iframes for the layout but it was done like that at one point all right so alberto has some more info about this synchronous uh asynchronous function thing so uh umberto says each type has their own uses it depends on whether the function calls are dependent on each other uh in some if not most cases you do not need calls to be fully executed before the rest of the code runs so you would want async calls uh for all of them to run at the same time you would want to use synchronous calls though to make sure that one function runs completely before the next okay that makes sense um umberto says i presume async would be industry standard because most function calls can be run simultaneously all right that's that's a great answer it's very informative thanks humberto uh christian says hello i've been following your live stream since august and i'm learning a lot specifically on react js your videos are some of my goto resources awesome thank you so much for saying that christian uh i i'm gonna tell you i got a comment uh a really positive comment on twitter earlier and i always get positive comments in the live chat i just wanna say i really really appreciate it when you all have comments like that i certainly don't mind criticism too uh you know i i always i'm trying to get better so criticism is fine but really positive comments like that help me to keep going you know they when i see stuff like that it's like i think you know what you you are really helping people you got to keep going this stream and it keeps me going i really appreciate it so um so thank you christian and thank you everyone who's given uh me a lot of positive encouragement i really really appreciate it let's see all right so that uh french sounding name that i couldn't pronounce actually means strawberry milk in french so i guess let me know how to pronounce that in french otherwise is it cool if i just call you strawberry milk because that's easier for me to say but i'd be happy to pronounce it properly if i can figure it out carlos says i moved away for a few years from web development i'd like to know how to upgrade myself and learn the current tools um carlos i just say check out it depends on how you like to learn if you're if you like videos there's a ton of stuff on youtube just make sure with videos you're watching are fairly new um check out some stuff on what's called es6 or es 2015 for some of the latest javascript stuff you can go beyond it and even check out es7 eight you know all that stuff but at least ex es6 for some of the newer things that are happening in javascript if you want to check out some of the newer frameworks you know check out react check out vue um this that would be my advice now i'm not exactly sure where you moved away and what you're working on in terms of web development um so i guess that would kind of depend on that but uh i guess it shouldn't be too hard to get back in like i said depending on what you were doing before um i personally kind of think that videos might be the best way to go uh with that just to kind of see what other people are doing uh but there's certainly a ton of blog posts out there that can help you out as well let's see the hopeless spirit says yeah it was a shame at the time none of us knew any better about frames and iframes looking back i shouldn't have just trusted our teachers and gone along with it yeah that's a really tough thing you know like you want to trust your teachers know what they're doing but there's really not a whole lot of incentive especially at the university level for professors to keep up to date right if a professor has tenure you know they really can't get fired unless they do something crazy so you know they have to keep up with all the meetings and paperwork and grading um where's the incentive for them to really stay up to date because you can only really stay up to date on things if you're actually working on projects you know they don't have time to do that so it's it's much easier for them to keep doing what they've been doing right they don't want to have to redo all their lesson plans and stuff every single semester to stay up to date right or even like what's the current best practice at the beginning of a semester might change by the end of the semester you know this field changes way too fast for the current you know way that colleges are set up to keep up so here at this university at franciscan university i'm trying to work with the computer science department to find a solution to that so i have done a guest lecture and we i'm hopefully going to maybe team teach a course so that the computer science professor can handle a lot of the basic the testing grading paperwork and a lot of the basics that don't change of web development and then i can come in and my part will be to get the students up to date on stuff i'm working on and what the latest is in the industry i think something like that where you have a collaboration with someone that's actually in the industry working would be the ideal situation for computer science students at the university level so anyway um i totally understand where you're coming from i actually dropped my web development course in college because of that very issue um i'm gonna have to wrap things up soon my wife's texting me asking me where i am i'm gonna need to go home soon uh so anyway that's kind of a tough thing you learn a lot of good things in a computer science program but you often don't learn a lot of new cutting edge things all right harshit says jesse what happened uh to the electron project you didn't even create the repo i thought i did create the repo where'd it go let's check it out github hmm did i never push that to github let's check out if you have more calm oh i'm sorry you know what i i'm not gonna be able to do it today because i gotta leave uh and go watch the baby but tomorrow i'm gonna do my best to remember to go back in i had thought that i had pushed that repo uh to get him evidently i didn't so um i will definitely do that uh at this week some point thank you for bringing that up harsha really really sorry about that um i just totally thought that i had done it already um let's see um at it says i stopped coding on free code cam months back because of my exams now i don't know where to start from i was a challenge 258 and now i've forgotten half the things uh added i the new curriculum is going to come out soon i think sometime this month so maybe if you want to just wait till that comes out and then start from the beginning again there might be a lot of new stuff uh that's what i would do if i was thinking about starting right now i would wait a week or two to see if the new curriculum was going to come out and then maybe try from there and if you really want to do some things now you know you can go back through and do some of the other problems if you want just to you know stay up on things but that new curriculum should be coming out really soon harsh it says it's 3 30 a.m now i have to sleep immediately otherwise mom will scold me hard waking that late if she's awake harshit yeah for sure go to sleep i do not want you to get in trouble uh with your mom i'll do my best to keep my streams earlier in the day for you all right so i really have to go now or my wife is going to be upset with me so thank you so much everyone this was a great stream really great discussion and questions uh i'm i'm gonna try to do another stream tomorrow a little earlier in the day uh for all of you over uh in in india i know it was really late for you watching i know we have quite a few people from india that watch uh and from that time zone so it'll be earlier tomorrow but until then have a great day
