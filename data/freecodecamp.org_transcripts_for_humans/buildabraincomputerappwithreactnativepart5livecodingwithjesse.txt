00:04 - hey everybody
00:05 - it's jesse welcome to live coding with
00:07 - jesse
00:09 - and we have a lot to do today i want to
00:11 - get this app
00:13 - submitted to
00:14 - the app store today
00:17 - and i'd love to do it while i'm on the
00:18 - stream
00:20 - uh so i think
00:23 - let's see
00:27 - so if y'all can hear me put something in
00:30 - the chat
00:31 - the um
00:33 - live stream is
00:35 - analytics look a little bit weird
00:37 - uh
00:38 - but let me know
00:41 - uh otherwise i'm gonna get started i see
00:44 - there's a lot of people in the chat
00:45 - saying hello so hey everybody
00:48 - just a quick um
00:50 - a quick intro
00:52 - we've been working on this app for this
00:54 - is the fifth live stream all right cool
00:56 - looks like you can hear me for some
00:57 - reason my um
00:59 - video preview
01:01 - in the um
01:02 - like the stream settings panel is saying
01:04 - the video is private
01:06 - uh which is really odd since obviously
01:08 - you all are in the chat
01:10 - but i've never had it show that before
01:12 - all right so
01:14 - we've been working on this app for five
01:16 - live streams now and um
01:21 - we are using
01:23 - we're connecting a react native app
01:26 - that's built with expo
01:29 - with a brain computer interface
01:31 - called the
01:33 - notion by
01:34 - a startup company called neurocity
01:37 - and we've successfully connected it so
01:40 - that
01:41 - it
01:42 - measures we wear this device it measures
01:44 - our level of focus and when we drop
01:46 - below a certain level the screen changes
01:49 - to red and it makes the device vibrate
01:53 - so
01:54 - just really kind of like bare
01:57 - uh essential functionality
01:59 - and now i want to actually put it out
02:01 - there so we can test it on devices
02:04 - so we got a lot to do before we can put
02:06 - it out there and i've been going over
02:08 - some of the documentation just so that i
02:11 - have some idea of this process this is
02:13 - my very first time actually publishing
02:16 - so i've i've made a few apps that that
02:18 - definitely work and i can run on devices
02:21 - but i've never actually gone through the
02:22 - step of putting it out to the app store
02:24 - and there's a few extra things you need
02:26 - to do to get your app from working to
02:29 - publishable so that's what we're going
02:31 - to do today
02:32 - i'm going to set a
02:35 - a timer
02:36 - and
02:38 - here on one of my other screens
02:41 - and when that timer goes off so it's
02:43 - going to be 25 minutes when that timer
02:44 - goes off i'm going to go over to the
02:45 - live chat i'm going to answer some
02:46 - questions so there's a lot of you in the
02:48 - chat i see you and i'm not going to
02:52 - ignore you forever
02:53 - i'm just going to focus on doing the
02:56 - work for about 25 minutes and then i'm
02:57 - going to go to the chat answer as many
02:59 - questions as i can so feel free to ask
03:01 - as many questions as you want in the
03:03 - chat i will get to them and
03:05 - you know keep it keep it positive and
03:07 - try to keep the spam down uh the last
03:10 - couple of streams it's been a little bit
03:11 - weird we've had a lot of uh people
03:13 - spamming the chat and by that i mean
03:16 - they're just they keep saying the same
03:18 - things over and over again or just
03:20 - typing in a bunch of nonsense over and
03:21 - over again it makes it really hard to
03:23 - read the chat for everybody watching so
03:26 - try to keep that to a minimum uh if i
03:28 - see that you're doing that then i will
03:32 - um
03:33 - stop you from being in the chat
03:35 - so
03:37 - uh i really i won't even mention
03:39 - anything like i'm just gonna stop you
03:40 - from being in the chat so
03:42 - um
03:43 - there's not gonna really be a warning i
03:45 - don't have time
03:47 - for that
03:48 - especially if we get a lot of people in
03:49 - the stream like we have right now so
03:52 - um
03:53 - if it gets too bad i might have a
03:55 - moderator
03:56 - but really it's never been a problem
03:58 - before i mean we've done like literally
04:00 - hundreds of streams and it's only been
04:02 - the last few streams it's been a problem
04:04 - so
04:05 - obviously any type of like bad language
04:08 - or you know saying mean things to each
04:10 - other stuff like that you're gonna be
04:12 - out of the chat so let's keep it all
04:14 - positive
04:15 - okay
04:16 - all right so let's get started
04:18 - if you want to try to follow along this
04:20 - project is on github i believe i put a
04:23 - link in the description to the the code
04:25 - on github so you can check out the code
04:27 - i'm also going to be on
04:29 - [Music]
04:30 - the
04:31 - on expo so their documentation let me
04:34 - put the link to the docs
04:36 - that i'm using
04:38 - in the
04:40 - chat so i got a lot of these windows
04:43 - open for things that we need to do
04:45 - and so i'm going to be jumping around a
04:47 - little bit
04:49 - but this is where i started at the link
04:52 - i just put in the chat
04:54 - so
04:55 - this started this is where i started
04:57 - we're going to start from here so we're
04:58 - starting with um
05:00 - deploying the app
05:02 - right so from deploying the app
05:04 - i believe i went to distributing
05:07 - or deploying
05:10 - yeah this is the distributing so we need
05:12 - to create native builds
05:16 - so to build the app
05:19 - i told you there's gonna be a lot of
05:20 - jumping around here the docs for expo
05:22 - are actually really good but it's
05:24 - there's a lot of steps here
05:26 - so
05:28 - we we've
05:29 - i believe we do have the expo cli
05:32 - installed
05:34 - um
05:35 - already which actually i can let me
05:37 - double check that now
05:40 - make sure i have it installed
05:46 - i know i have installed one of my
05:47 - machines i actually might not have it on
05:49 - this one so we might need to do that
05:52 - whoops
06:02 - let's make some space here because we're
06:04 - going to be in the in the terminal a bit
06:06 - more than normal so i want to see all
06:08 - right it looks like
06:10 - yeah we have this installed otherwise we
06:12 - wouldn't be getting all of this stuff
06:14 - so
06:15 - yeah
06:17 - i believe we have
06:18 - this expo
06:28 - now it says for windows users
06:30 - we need to have um
06:34 - wsl enabled
06:37 - so we need to do that so this step if
06:40 - you're on a mac or if you're on linux
06:42 - you probably won't need to do this step
06:43 - if you're on windows you need to do this
06:45 - step so let's do this
06:47 - um so i have the documentation open
06:49 - already for this we need to install the
06:51 - windows uh
06:52 - subsystem
06:53 - uh for linux so
06:56 - i'll make this a bit bigger
06:58 - i've never done this before let's see
07:00 - let's see if it works
07:01 - so we need to copy this and run it in
07:03 - powershell as an admin so let's try to
07:06 - open
07:08 - windows powershell and let's see if we
07:11 - can run as administrator
07:14 - yes all right so we're running
07:17 - powershell as an admin
07:19 - let's see if i can make it bigger all
07:21 - right i don't know how to make it make
07:22 - the text bigger but i'm just copying and
07:24 - pasting
07:25 - what i just got out of this window on
07:28 - the right hand side
07:30 - and
07:32 - enable windows optional feature
07:35 - cool all right so it looks like it's
07:36 - doing something here
07:40 - let's see do you want to restart the
07:42 - computer to complete operation now oh no
07:44 - i gotta restart
07:48 - i was afraid this was gonna happen
07:50 - ah it does it says restart right there
07:53 - i didn't i was reading through all these
07:54 - documents as fast as i could right
07:56 - before this and i didn't see a restart
07:58 - all right it looks like we're going to
07:59 - have to restart so here's what i'm going
08:01 - to do
08:02 - i'm going to restart which basically the
08:04 - stream is just going to freeze up for
08:05 - like a second the restarts on this
08:08 - machine because it's pretty new are
08:09 - actually very quick
08:11 - so um
08:13 - let's just get it over with now
08:16 - um let's restart i should be back hang
08:18 - in there for maybe like
08:20 - i don't know two minutes at the most and
08:22 - um
08:24 - and we'll do this restart
09:43 - all right cool can you all hear me now
09:45 - am i back
09:49 - it looks like i'm back
09:50 - so uh
09:58 - i'm gonna keep going
10:00 - all right sweet back up yeah actually
10:03 - the the thing that took me the longest
10:04 - that was a really quick restart was that
10:06 - it restarted me and um
10:08 - by default my youtube account is set to
10:10 - my personal account so it tried to log
10:13 - me back into the free code camp um
10:15 - control panel
10:17 - but it wouldn't let me in because i
10:18 - wasn't free code camp so
10:21 - um i switched to my phone for a second
10:23 - just to give you all an update
10:25 - but anyway it's working now so let me
10:28 - turn the stream off on my phone
10:31 - and
10:32 - let's bring to get rid of my vpn and
10:36 - bring up my code
10:39 - sweet
10:43 - actually honestly like
10:45 - uh if you get a good windows system
10:48 - uh restarts are really fast it used to
10:50 - be windows for like super hard to
10:53 - restart
10:55 - sweet
10:56 - um
10:57 - looks like there's a vs code extension
10:59 - for the windows linux subsystem so i'm
11:02 - just going to install it
11:05 - because it seems like
11:14 - cool i'll read about more about that
11:16 - later on
11:17 - um but i guess it's good to have
11:21 - semantic highlighting has been applied
11:23 - sweets
11:27 - all right
11:28 - so now that we have that we can continue
11:30 - on we need to install a linux
11:32 - distribution i think i'm gonna go with
11:34 - uh ubuntu because that's what i'm used
11:36 - to using
11:38 - uh out of out of any linux distro um i
11:41 - don't really know if anybody has any
11:43 - suggestions as to whether to install
11:45 - ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 let me know in the
11:49 - chat i've used 16 more often
11:52 - um
11:53 - but i don't really know what the
11:55 - difference is in upgrading to 18 so
11:58 - i'm gonna have to make a decision here
12:00 - in like
12:01 - three minutes so just let me know
12:12 - let's go 16 or 18.
12:14 - all right so
12:16 - looks like we got one vote for 18. i'll
12:18 - go with 18. i mean honestly it's
12:20 - obviously the the new the newer version
12:22 - so may as well go with the newer version
12:24 - i'm open this in a new window so i can
12:25 - keep the documentation open
12:29 - and uh let's read the next it looks like
12:31 - we open it up we just get it
12:33 - it installs it and then we initialize
12:36 - which i already have those that
12:38 - documentation open as well so we'll do
12:40 - the initialization it looks like
12:41 - everybody's saying 18.
12:43 - cool
12:45 - gam002 says do debian it's the most
12:49 - stable
12:51 - if i had more time to research maybe i'd
12:53 - think about debian but for right now
12:55 - like it's been a while since i used
12:57 - ubuntu but i'm more familiar with all
12:59 - the commands and stuff so i think i'm
13:00 - just gonna go with ubuntu not i don't
13:02 - really think
13:04 - that we're gonna have to do that much
13:05 - with it i think it just needs to be
13:07 - installed to do the rest of the steps
13:08 - for expo
13:09 - um
13:11 - but let's get that and get it started
13:14 - yeah let's open microsoft store
13:20 - get it
13:25 - install
13:34 - all right it's going pretty quick it
13:35 - doesn't seem like it'll be too too much
13:37 - longer so once we get this we need to
13:39 - initialize so let's look at these steps
13:41 - while we're waiting for the install
13:43 - and um
13:52 - all right so we'll launch it
13:53 - and
13:56 - i need to set up an account
14:02 - update and upgrade the packages
14:04 - hopefully this doesn't take too long
14:10 - and that's it
14:11 - all right that's that's pretty seems
14:13 - pretty easy
14:14 - um we probably can just get that started
14:16 - and then move on to another step and
14:18 - while we're waiting for that to finish
14:20 - this is uh really sweet um
14:25 - uh colors they got look at this they got
14:27 - the weather on here i wonder how they
14:29 - had that all set up
14:30 - anyway that's pretty cool
14:33 - this is kind of cool i'm actually glad
14:34 - i'm getting installed i'm installing
14:36 - this i'm going to probably play around
14:37 - with this
14:39 - after the stream
14:41 - um
14:42 - okay cool
14:45 - so almost done with the uh installation
14:48 - looks like maybe 75 of the way down
14:50 - there
14:51 - so we'll get to that in a second i think
14:54 - we can get rid of this step we can get
14:56 - rid of this step now
14:58 - and what else can we get rid of
15:02 - yay
15:03 - all right so let's launch it
15:06 - so installing this may take a few
15:08 - minutes so not a problem we got other
15:10 - steps that we can do that don't depend
15:11 - on the step yet
15:14 - so
15:15 - there's a guide here to deploying to the
15:19 - app stores
15:21 - and
15:23 - there's a lot of stuff making sure it
15:24 - works on different phones
15:26 - i'm gonna skip over a lot of that
15:28 - because really
15:30 - this for this first mvp launch like it
15:34 - just needs to work on my phone all right
15:36 - that was really fast enter a new
15:38 - username
15:41 - alright
15:42 - i'm just going to enter
15:46 - my name
15:48 - and
15:49 - i'm going to create a password with
15:52 - lastpass
16:05 - [Music]
16:15 - and let's paste that in there
16:18 - see if it lets me paste
16:22 - cool
16:25 - what
16:28 - all right so i guess it's not allowing
16:30 - copy and paste
16:31 - so
16:32 - i'm just gonna have to type in a
16:33 - password
16:43 - all right cool
16:45 - sweet so we're in now we need to do
16:48 - our app get
16:50 - so
16:52 - we're gonna copy this we're gonna do
16:53 - sudo which like lets you run as an admin
16:56 - and then update and
16:58 - uh upgrade all our apps
17:00 - let's paste that
17:02 - why is it not letting me paste anything
17:06 - dang it
17:08 - all right well i'll just type it then
17:11 - sudo apps
17:15 - upgrade
17:25 - oops i messed it up update
17:29 - and
17:36 - upgrade
17:42 - all right cool
17:43 - that's doing its thing
17:46 - oh looks like uh sameep says control
17:49 - shift
17:50 - copy and paste for copy and pasting and
17:52 - linux terminal oh and michael says to
17:54 - all right sweet thank you for that
17:57 - i will definitely
17:59 - be using that in the future
18:02 - all right so we just need to wait for
18:03 - that and
18:05 - one of the next steps we need to have is
18:07 - an app icon and a splash screen so
18:12 - i'm going to go with the
18:14 - um it says we need to provide something
18:16 - that's at least 512 by 512 pixels
18:20 - um but we need uh 1024 by 1024 for ios
18:24 - so eventually we're going to be on ios
18:26 - so i think we're just going to go with
18:27 - 1024x1024
18:30 - i do you want to continue
18:32 - yes let's continue
18:36 - so
18:40 - i have a free
18:44 - um image editing software
18:47 - called uh so g-i-m-p
18:50 - i'm just gonna use that
18:52 - let's see
18:53 - i think i already started a didn't save
18:57 - i started like right before the stream a
18:59 - template but
19:01 - we can just create it again so
19:03 - i'm just going to create one that's the
19:05 - dimensions we want
19:07 - 10 24 by 1024 so now we have this we
19:11 - have our background
19:13 - and uh let's let's just make a solid
19:15 - color background
19:17 - i don't know what color to do
19:19 - uh
19:20 - let's just
19:24 - got it there we go there's our our paint
19:25 - bucket
19:27 - uh
19:28 - color fill
19:30 - there's a pattern fill
19:32 - well what patterns can we do
19:38 - background background color fill fill
19:40 - whole selection
19:41 - all right
19:43 - what colors right now we have black and
19:45 - red
19:46 - or black and white let's change it to
19:48 - something else
19:50 - um
19:51 - how about just this blue color let's use
19:53 - blue
19:54 - i think our buttons blue in our app so
19:56 - that's like the only color we're using
19:58 - other than like the the red color so
20:00 - let's do that
20:03 - oops
20:04 - why is that not filling
20:08 - um
20:11 - there we go
20:12 - all right so we got our color here
20:14 - let's make a new layer
20:17 - a new layer
20:19 - and let's call this layer text
20:23 - and inside our text layer
20:26 - let's add a text box
20:30 - and
20:31 - i'm just going to type in our text box
20:33 - um
20:37 - s f
20:41 - and the color we're gonna
20:43 - we're gonna make the color white
20:45 - so we can actually see it
20:47 - and let's make the text like
20:49 - i don't know like 100 pixels
20:52 - and let's use
20:55 - um
20:57 - there we go let's use this font
21:02 - i don't know why i can't see it
21:14 - oops because the color got changed
21:27 - there we go
21:34 - you can tell i'm not like
21:36 - i'm not at all very skilled at this kind
21:39 - of work so
21:41 - my icon is just going to be letters
21:45 - and we're just gonna make big letters
21:53 - on a background
21:55 - because i i'm not skilled at anything
21:58 - artistic so eventually it'd be cool to
22:01 - like get a real icon but for right now i
22:04 - just need to get something done
22:07 - actually let me let me check back in on
22:08 - this linux thing
22:10 - cool looks like everything ran all right
22:12 - so i think we're we're good and we're
22:14 - good with linux i'm gonna leave it open
22:15 - just in case there's another step that i
22:17 - forgot about but i think we're good and
22:20 - everything's fine for that step of
22:22 - getting the linux distro running
22:24 - uh so let's see
22:27 - that looks like
22:29 - pretty much in the center i'm not too
22:31 - worried about it
22:33 - so we can export this as so we can do is
22:37 - first first thing we can do is save and
22:39 - let's save this as
22:41 - just sf.xcf so that way we can come in
22:44 - and edit it if we need to
22:47 - and then we're going to export it
22:49 - as a ping
22:51 - so sf.png

23:12 - the chat
23:14 - i'm gonna answer some questions when we
23:15 - come back we're gonna take this same
23:17 - design here and just change the
23:19 - dimensions and we're gonna make a splash
23:21 - screen
23:22 - and then we should have everything we
23:24 - need to go forward with
23:26 - doing our first like build
23:29 - maybe we might use the android simulator
23:31 - in android studio to do one test run
23:33 - before we actually deploy it but we're
23:35 - getting close to being able to deploy
23:37 - this
23:38 - all right so let's see

24:05 - they're asking like in this live stream
24:06 - will you learn web development um this
24:08 - one
24:09 - probably not because we're doing a lot
24:11 - of like setup work there's not really a
24:13 - lot of code going on in this stream
24:16 - but in the previous streams we do a lot
24:17 - more code so you might learn a little
24:19 - bit more uh from that
24:21 - uh
24:23 - let's see
24:25 - uh i'm a full stack mern web developer

25:45 - you know try to help help out where you
25:47 - can
25:54 - all right
25:59 - someone asked what coding language this
26:00 - is uh the app is built with javascript
26:03 - so with uh react native
26:05 - all right somebody's
26:08 - spam in the chat see let's uh
26:12 - we're gonna hide that so
26:15 - let's see
26:23 - amir asks if there's a playlist of this
26:25 - you know what now that we have uh you
26:27 - know we're up to five streams now uh i
26:29 - think i will make a playlist of this so
26:31 - that'll be coming i'll try to make a
26:33 - playlist at some point today for it
26:37 - someone asks what this app will be able
26:38 - to do
26:40 - um
26:42 - this app will be able to track the level
26:44 - of focus that you currently have on
26:46 - whatever you're doing and then warn you
26:48 - when your level of focus is dropping
26:55 - uh charbelle says what are you using for
26:57 - rendering react native
26:59 - um i'm not i'm not exactly sure what you
27:02 - mean by rendering react native but uh we
27:04 - use um expo
27:07 - uh
27:08 - so that's
27:10 - i don't know if that's exactly what you
27:11 - mean but that
27:13 - let me know if that answers your
27:14 - question
27:18 - uh benson asks if it's morning or night
27:20 - uh it's
27:21 - 12 30 p.m where i'm at right now
27:32 - uh bloody creature says uh don't waste
27:35 - your time self-taught programming takes
27:36 - too long
27:38 - um well it does take a while but uh i
27:41 - don't think it's a waste of time like to
27:43 - be honest with you um teaching myself to
27:45 - program was a huge thing like
27:48 - in terms of being able to provide for my
27:50 - family like
27:51 - if you take like the job i had before i
27:54 - started to teach myself programming and
27:56 - the job i have now i make about five
27:58 - times as much money per year now as i
28:01 - did before
28:03 - and that was just from self-taught
28:05 - programming so it took me a while took
28:08 - me a couple years i didn't get there
28:10 - overnight i had
28:11 - jobs in between
28:13 - um but
28:15 - you know it's it definitely is better
28:17 - like
28:18 - you know i didn't have to spend any
28:19 - money on going to university
28:22 - uh or all that time i was able to make
28:24 - money the whole time so uh i don't think
28:27 - self-taught programming it takes too
28:29 - long or is a waste of time is actually
28:32 - a really good way for me to keep working
28:35 - and keep learning and keep paying the
28:37 - bills and providing for my family
28:40 - without having to go into debt from
28:41 - student loans and stuff and now like
28:44 - uh i'm i'm very lucky i'm i'm able to
28:47 - make more money you know from my family
28:50 - than i ever thought i would be able to
28:53 - so
28:54 - yeah it worked out for me
29:03 - let's see
29:04 - a lot of people are asking like what
29:06 - we're doing for this app so i explained
29:08 - that a couple times already so um i
29:10 - guess if if you're just joining and you
29:12 - didn't hear the explanations you can
29:13 - always rewind it like before beforehand
29:16 - in the uh stream to hear the explanation
29:19 - and then come back to the
29:20 - like what we're doing now um if you're
29:23 - joining a little bit late and want to
29:24 - catch up you can always like
29:26 - rewind the stream to the beginning and
29:28 - then play it on double speed and then
29:30 - you'll you'll get everything that
29:31 - happened and you'll catch up with us uh
29:33 - on the live so i recommend doing that if
29:36 - if you join like in the middle and
29:37 - you're totally lost that's a good option
29:43 - let's see
29:45 - blazing up says never even heard of
29:47 - react native before is it good um i i
29:50 - think it's good i think if you already
29:51 - know javascript uh then it's a really
29:54 - really good way to build
29:57 - native apps
29:58 - [Music]
29:59 - without having to learn different
30:01 - languages
30:02 - for android and ios
30:07 - oh no my timer quit again
30:09 - all right that's it i'm done with this
30:11 - timer this is like three streams in a
30:13 - row now that my timer quit working
30:16 - so i gotta find a new timer
30:18 - that one is just not working for us
30:22 - i thought it had been a long time here
30:25 - all right so i didn't get through all
30:26 - the questions i'm going to stop and get
30:28 - back to the code now uh i'll come back
30:30 - to the questions though
30:35 - all right so we've saved this as our app
30:38 - icon now we need to do a
30:41 - um
30:42 - let's find this
30:47 - we need to do
30:48 - a splash screen which i also have up
30:51 - here
30:53 - actually well let's let's uh upload this
30:55 - while we're waiting
30:57 - so i found this this site which is app
30:59 - icon generator which you upload your
31:01 - icon in 1024 by 1024 pixels and then
31:04 - it'll give you icons in different sizes
31:07 - and files so uh let's let's do that um
31:11 - we're going to name it
31:16 - so let's upload our file which we named
31:24 - what do we name it
31:28 - it should be right here
31:31 - unless it went to a different
31:33 - folder
31:36 - now the default folder to save those
31:38 - files is right here
31:40 - that's really odd
31:42 - let's look in our our folder system then
31:56 - that's weird let me export it again
32:00 - see where it went
32:01 - sf.png
32:04 - oh it went into documents that's weird
32:07 - for some reason the default folder was
32:09 - documents
32:16 - all right so we'll go to documents
32:20 - [Music]
32:22 - sf
32:25 - area
32:26 - and i want to name it the same thing
32:28 - that we have
32:29 - in
32:31 - our app currently just to like save time
32:34 - so it's icon.png
32:42 - generate these i'm not going to worry
32:43 - about the ios stuff for now
32:46 - we'll do
32:48 - um probably like a different stream at
32:50 - some point and do the ios build and
32:53 - everything
32:54 - uh
32:55 - all right so we have our icons and i
32:58 - want to
32:59 - unzip these
33:01 - oops
33:04 - i think i opened this twice yeah i did
33:06 - all right so
33:11 - what did it send me
33:14 - wow
33:16 - send a lot of different files here let's
33:18 - let's see what the heck it said
33:24 - i just want
33:29 - that's crazy all right well let's just
33:30 - extract them all for now
33:35 - so we can take a look at them here see
33:38 - what we want
33:40 - bring this over
33:42 - app icons
33:44 - all right so this one looks like
33:46 - play store that's what we really want
33:49 - uh so i'm just gonna grab that one i
33:52 - think
33:57 - yeah for now i'm just grabbing this one
33:59 - i think we just need one for now
34:03 - i actually think
34:05 - what is the difference with this
34:12 - yeah maybe we didn't need to do that
34:21 - you know what
34:23 - i'm not going to use those
34:25 - i thought we'd we'd get like different
34:27 - ones that would have been that would
34:28 - have worked but i think i'm just going
34:30 - to
34:32 - pull over uh the file that we made
34:35 - so in our documents
34:39 - and
34:40 - so we have this sf
34:43 - and i'm gonna pull that over to our
34:45 - assets
34:47 - and
34:49 - i'm going to delete this icon
34:52 - and i'm going to rename this one
34:57 - there we go so now that'll be our icon
35:00 - and we can move on to our splash screen
35:06 - let's see this is the icon page
35:11 - we could just get rid of this page we
35:12 - don't need that anymore
35:14 - uh splash screen okay
35:18 - add a splash screen
35:23 - i thought i had this open already
35:26 - i guess not
35:33 - all right 1242 by 2436.
35:39 - all right now this is for ios but i i
35:41 - read through this a little bit uh
35:43 - earlier i just kind of skimmed through
35:45 - it and i believe this will also work for
35:47 - android
35:48 - so
35:49 - we're gonna we're gonna try to do that
35:51 - as well so let's go back to our image
35:53 - editor
35:55 - there we go yep
35:58 - and
35:59 - let me
36:03 - [Music]
36:04 - i'm gonna pull this out we don't need
36:06 - the full screen
36:07 - i'm gonna shrink it up a little bit so
36:09 - we can see
36:11 - our instructions as well 12 24 okay
36:16 - so let's take our background
36:17 - and let's see if we can resize it
36:39 - oh i don't think i can from there let's
36:41 - talk about let's see if we can do it
36:43 - here
36:47 - image
36:50 - canvas size yeah
36:52 - all right cool let's change the canvas
36:55 - size
36:56 - to
36:58 - we want width to be
37:00 - 1242 pixels and
37:04 - we're going to be 24
37:06 - 36 pixels tall
37:11 - let's resize that and let's let's put
37:13 - the sf part
37:15 - right in the middle
37:21 - that looks
37:23 - that looks okay
37:29 - all right
37:31 - all right cool so now we have um
37:35 - a different size we have our background
37:37 - here let's see if we can fill in our
37:39 - background with
37:44 - with this color i don't know if we can
37:48 - um color
37:51 - yeah it's not gonna let us
37:52 - what do we need to do here
37:56 - let's
38:00 - scale layer
38:02 - change size resize layer to the size of
38:05 - image
38:08 - see if that'll work sweet that works
38:10 - alright cool
38:12 - all right awesome
38:14 - so we resized our background layer now
38:17 - let's export this
38:20 - and let's just export this
38:23 - i guess we could say
38:28 - we'll go sf splash
38:31 - i'm saying sf because i've i've decided
38:33 - to name the app stay focused i don't
38:35 - really know if there's another app named
38:36 - meta or how that works but
38:38 - that's just the name that i uh
38:41 - thought of
38:43 - yep export
38:47 - all right now
38:49 - let's move this over
38:56 - oops
38:58 - oh there it is
39:07 - let's delete our splash
39:09 - and
39:10 - change this to
39:13 - splash
39:14 - [Music]
39:17 - cool
39:20 - all right so
39:22 - we should have what we need and
39:25 - i think our
39:28 - app.json already is showing
39:30 - what we need so yeah
39:32 - so our splash
39:34 - it's already there uh background color
39:39 - actually so let's change our background
39:41 - color to match what we made the
39:42 - background color for our app
39:45 - we should be able to find that out i
39:47 - think from
39:49 - this
39:54 - what's the current there we go
39:58 - there's a hex color
40:04 - cool
40:07 - let's save that
40:09 - that might be the only code change that
40:11 - we need to do
40:17 - all right cool
40:26 - and
40:28 - i think we're just going to leave
40:29 - everything else for the splash screens
40:32 - as
40:34 - like the defaults
40:36 - and we're going to be done with that
40:37 - step
40:39 - and
40:42 - let's see actually we're done with this
40:44 - as well
40:46 - let's get rid of that
40:48 - deploy
40:59 - all right yeah a lot of this stuff
41:07 - i'm not going to worry about for now
41:25 - okay
41:26 - we need android permissions
41:28 - we might need permissions for that
41:30 - vibrate feature
41:45 - yeah let's let's check out our
41:46 - permissions here
42:06 - okay so we do have vibrate
42:09 - all right let's add that then
42:22 - [Music]
42:23 - whoops forget the
42:25 - comma
42:29 - [Music]
42:32 - android and then
42:34 - [Music]
42:40 - permissions
42:42 - and permissions is an array
42:45 - of strings
42:50 - vibrates
42:52 - okay
42:55 - all right so we should be good there
42:57 - let's get rid of that
42:59 - and
43:01 - comment at projections
43:03 - i'm not going to worry about the ad
43:04 - projections until
43:07 - we uh
43:08 - we get rejected so let's get rid of that
43:12 - all right let's talk about
43:14 - okay so
43:15 - way back to where we started here
43:18 - we're still on step one
43:20 - installed it uh install g expo click
43:26 - okay so i am using yarn let's just go
43:29 - ahead and be 100 sure that we have
43:31 - installed this
43:34 - and we're going to do a global install
43:39 - uh it's just gonna work without let's
43:41 - see if it works without me
43:43 - running this as an admin
43:48 - it might give us an error
43:50 - if i'm not an admin
43:54 - if it does no big deal we'll just reopen
43:56 - uh
43:57 - as an admin
44:02 - all right we've already
44:05 - i believe configured app.json
44:09 - well let's see
44:12 - for android at least
44:13 - looks like we're going to need to have a
44:15 - package
44:17 - name and a version code
44:19 - i don't think we have that yet so
44:22 - um
44:23 - let's try that
44:25 - let's create a
44:27 - package
44:31 - and i guess i'll just use the
44:35 - um
44:38 - your company dot your app name
44:41 - um
44:42 - i don't know what my company name is
44:43 - going to be
44:48 - just name it after myself and your app
44:50 - name
44:52 - stay focused
44:55 - and then
44:59 - version
45:04 - code is going to be one this version one
45:09 - there we go
45:10 - save that
45:12 - all right
45:13 - still fetching packages
45:17 - all right we'll give that another minute
45:18 - if nothing happens then maybe i'll stop
45:20 - it and then do it oh cool
45:24 - just being too impatient there looks
45:26 - like it's still doing its thing
45:29 - um
45:30 - see i'll do i'm going to stop maybe in
45:33 - like
45:34 - 10 minutes and get back to some
45:36 - questions so hang in there if you uh if
45:38 - you're asking some questions i will get
45:40 - to the chat again and and like
45:43 - 10 minutes
45:45 - so about 1 p.m eastern time i'm gonna
45:47 - stop and do questions i went over a
45:49 - little bit on the last question so sweet
45:52 - all right so we're definitely installed
45:54 - now
45:55 - it looks like maybe i didn't have uh
45:57 - this installed globally i think maybe i
45:59 - just had it installed uh locally like on
46:01 - this package
46:03 - so good thing we went through that
46:06 - so that should work
46:08 - and
46:13 - name icon and version are required
46:17 - slug is the url name that you ask
46:19 - javascript is pub just publish to
46:24 - let's see if we have
46:26 - slug right stay focused
46:32 - just double checking to make sure we
46:33 - have what we need
46:38 - it looks good i'm not worried about ios
46:40 - for right now
46:46 - uh sdk version do we have that yeah we
46:49 - do okay
46:58 - let's take out ios from our platforms
47:01 - for right now since we're not targeting
47:03 - ios
47:05 - at the moment
47:07 - we'll just do android and web
47:13 - alright
47:14 - we can start the android build
47:23 - uh okay all right this is interesting
47:25 - let's let's take the time to fig to
47:27 - understand this here uh because we are
47:29 - building for android so we can do a
47:31 - build apk or an android app bundle
47:34 - app bundles are recommended but you have
47:37 - to make sure the google play app signing
47:39 - is enabled for your project you can read
47:41 - more about it here
47:48 - okay it looks like we'll need a key
47:50 - store um that they will generate for us
47:53 - which is sweet because i don't know what
47:55 - that is
47:57 - if you let expo generate a key store for
47:59 - you we strongly recommend that you later
48:01 - fetch the key store and back up your key
48:03 - store all right we'll do that and we'll
48:05 - i'll save it in lastpass
48:09 - we'll need that to update the app
48:18 - all right cool let's just get down wait
48:20 - for it to finish building
48:51 - okay
48:52 - so we can call a web hook
48:56 - that'll let us know when the build is
48:58 - done i'm not going to worry about that
49:02 - and we can test it
49:04 - we'll definitely want to test it
49:08 - and then we'll submit it okay so
49:10 - here's what we're going to do first
49:11 - we're going to test uh
49:14 - we're going to test it
49:15 - before we go through the build because
49:17 - the build seems like it may take a
49:19 - little bit
49:20 - but then
49:22 - test and then we'll run this
49:26 - and uh so let's let's do the test
49:30 - and this is going to be
49:32 - actually let's do
49:33 - let's commit the the changes we made
49:38 - we need to get add git commit
49:42 - we have this message uh
49:45 - and um
49:48 - add icons and
49:54 - update app.json
49:56 - we're gonna push that to github
49:59 - so
50:00 - that's push and now let's run yarn start
50:10 - and
50:11 - let's try to run this on
50:14 - the
50:14 - android
50:18 - emulator
50:28 - all right looks like i'll have to start
50:29 - it first so let's do
50:31 - android android studio
50:36 - this would be a nice test of the power
50:39 - of this computer to see if we can run
50:41 - all this um
50:45 - we need to do
50:47 - abd manager and i already set up a uh
50:51 - a test pixel device so let's start that
50:55 - up
50:57 - hey it was already running the previous
50:59 - version before we did all the uh
51:02 - all the updates here
51:05 - all right so now that that's running we
51:06 - should be able to run this again i'm
51:07 - just pressing the a button as a shortcut
51:10 - to start this up i could come over here
51:11 - and press the emulator button
51:14 - all right so now
51:18 - we should get a connection here
51:22 - at some point
51:26 - it's possible that we might need to
51:30 - refresh the app which we can do
51:33 - let's do a refresh now
51:35 - there we go
51:36 - all right so now it's going to load the
51:38 - new stuff
51:39 - sweet
51:40 - um so now we have the new stuff here uh
51:43 - we can try to link let's try to link our
51:45 - device and actually log in once
51:47 - and see if that
51:50 - just to run through make sure we don't
51:51 - get any crazy errors or anything right
51:55 - so i need to go on my other screen here
51:57 - and grab some of my info
52:04 - so i'm going to grab device id
52:07 - and
52:09 - password
52:11 - oops
52:13 - no let me paste
52:17 - it's not letting me paste no
52:19 - there's gotta be
52:20 - there's gotta be a uh setting on here to
52:22 - let me paste stuff in here
52:25 - um
52:28 - there's some is there a keyboard option
52:40 - no
52:41 - all right
52:49 - there we go well at least i found the
52:52 - found the dark theme
52:56 - uh if i have to actually type out this
53:00 - is gonna it's gonna take five minutes to
53:02 - type everything out
53:11 - that's crazy
53:18 - you know what actually
53:19 - there we go there's the paste all right
53:22 - if i hold in for a second it just hit me
53:25 - like oh maybe i have to pace like i do
53:27 - normally on an android device and that's
53:29 - you just hold in
53:31 - the the button like you're tapping like
53:33 - a long tap and then you get paste so
53:37 - crisis averted
53:40 - i just should like not make my password
53:43 - 70 characters long and then maybe i'd be
53:45 - all right
53:49 - i just listened to too many hacker
53:51 - podcasts and now it's made me paranoid
53:53 - about
53:54 - making my passwords very long
53:58 - but i figure like if we're dealing with
53:59 - data from my own brain i should have
54:01 - long passwords right
54:06 - sweet all right let's see so setting a
54:09 - timer for a long period of time multiple
54:11 - minutes is performance correctness issue
54:12 - on android let's read this what it's
54:15 - saying
54:16 - as it keeps the timer module awake and
54:18 - timers can only be called when the app
54:20 - is in the foreground okay that's fine
54:27 - so set timeout do we have a set timeout
54:29 - in our app
54:31 - oops
54:33 - i don't need that
54:41 - all right so we don't actually have a
54:43 - set timeout in our code so i'm guessing
54:45 - that's in maybe one of the packages
54:47 - we're using so can't really do anything
54:49 - about that so i'm gonna
54:51 - i'm gonna dismiss that
54:54 - all right cool so this looks good we're
54:56 - logged in um
54:58 - i don't
54:59 - actually have the
55:01 - headset on so let me let me turn the
55:03 - headset on
55:04 - just so that we can verify like with
55:07 - with data
55:11 - if if we're gonna get um
55:14 - like if it will work with the data once
55:16 - we do that we can actually do the build
55:19 - another way i could test this is i could
55:22 - link i could hook up my android phone
55:25 - by a usb cable to my computer and we
55:28 - could test like that but if i did that
55:30 - you all wouldn't be able to see it so
55:32 - that's why i'm not testing that way we
55:34 - did that a couple of streams ago and it
55:36 - it did work with the previous version of
55:39 - the app none of the logic has really
55:41 - changed too much so i think it's it's
55:43 - fine it'll still work
55:45 - uh what i don't think we can test is the
55:48 - vibration feature
55:49 - so i don't know if we're going to see
55:51 - anything at all when the app is supposed
55:53 - to vibrate
55:54 - um but
55:57 - the uh this notion device is starting
55:59 - this is the brain computer interface
56:00 - i'll put this on in a second and we
56:02 - should see some real data from this
56:05 - as soon as the operating system on this
56:07 - is started then we'll we'll go forward
56:10 - with it
56:11 - while i'm waiting for that which should
56:13 - only be a few more seconds i'll check
56:15 - the chat
56:24 - all right um i got some questions about
56:26 - what am i building it's a brain computer
56:30 - app that checks your level of focus if
56:32 - you want to know more about it you can
56:34 - check out previous streams or
56:36 - go to like the beginning of this stream
56:38 - and you should be able to get
56:40 - a better explanation
56:43 - while i'm waiting for the device to
56:45 - start too i want to remind everybody
56:46 - that if you're interested in this
56:48 - particular device the the notion from
56:50 - neurocity you can check out my youtube
56:53 - channel the links in the description i
56:54 - did a more in-depth review of this
56:57 - device and showed off some of the stuff
56:59 - that it can do
57:00 - so
57:02 - check that out
57:04 - i also do some coding tutorials i just
57:06 - did one on typescript like an intro to
57:08 - typescript i did a video on uh
57:11 - javascript documentation cool it's
57:13 - online so let me put this on
57:17 - so if if you at all like what i'm doing
57:19 - here please check out my my channel as
57:21 - well and i'm trying to do
57:24 - since everybody's in quarantine i'd like
57:26 - to do some type of content probably like
57:29 - a live stream or a video every day i'm
57:31 - going to try to alternate between live
57:32 - streams on free code camp and a video on
57:35 - my own channel
57:36 - so
57:38 - hopefully it's it's helpful to some
57:40 - people especially if you're quarantined
57:41 - by yourself i'm hoping that maybe this
57:44 - is like
57:45 - you know a little bit of interaction
57:47 - with with other developers you know with
57:49 - me and with the people in the live
57:50 - stream
57:51 - um
57:52 - i know it's it's probably tough
57:55 - uh tough for a lot of people right now
57:57 - so
57:58 - i'm not a doctor i'm not a mental health
58:00 - expert uh but i do know how to code so
58:03 - i'm i'm gonna do that
58:05 - all right this looks like it's working
58:07 - so as i suspected we're not really
58:09 - getting the vibration
58:11 - because it's a simulator
58:14 - so
58:15 - but since i successfully tested the
58:17 - vibration
58:18 - before on on a real device then i'm just
58:21 - going to assume that it works
58:24 - so
58:26 - cool
58:27 - that works
58:29 - all right i'm going to test logging out
58:30 - now
58:33 - oh okay you know what when we log out
58:35 - nothing happens on the screen
58:40 - that's interesting
58:45 - i think maybe we should have something
58:46 - happen on the screen otherwise users
58:48 - would have to like close the app
58:50 - something needs to happen let's fix that
58:52 - before we before we do anything else
58:54 - because i think that's that's a big deal
58:56 - i'm going to take this off just for now
58:58 - so i can put my headphones back up
59:00 - um
59:02 - yeah i think that that's actually a pr
59:04 - that would be a pretty annoying thing if
59:06 - the user had to you know like constantly
59:09 - restart
59:10 - every time they want they logged out so
59:13 - uh let's let's fix that
59:16 - now and
59:20 - let's see how we can do that so
59:23 - when we log out
59:25 - what would change
59:27 - so let's see right now the um the login
59:31 - page
59:33 - is shown
59:36 - if we don't have a user
59:40 - so what is logout do
59:42 - so notion log out
59:47 - let's find our logout function
59:56 - oh we just directly call notion.logout
60:01 - let's see what we could do
60:11 - i think if if we create a function
60:14 - that's a log out function
60:17 - and we add notion.log out
60:27 - then
60:28 - we can also manually clear the user
60:32 - and that should that should fix it so
60:35 - let's add a logout function
60:40 - i'm going to do a log out and
60:44 - it's going to take
60:45 - no parameters
60:48 - and
60:50 - we're going to do a notion.log out and
60:53 - we're also going to set user back to
60:56 - let me see what we have
60:59 - we're going to set it back to null
61:04 - oops set user
61:09 - no
61:11 - okay
61:12 - let's save that
61:16 - and see like a lot of stuff is happening
61:19 - here we should be able to see
61:21 - oops
61:23 - permission denied for what
61:30 - let's dismiss all that
61:32 - let's do a refresh
61:34 - [Music]
61:40 - it looks like
61:45 - all right let me uh copy my password
61:47 - again
61:55 - [Music]
62:07 - okay
62:11 - now when we log out this time it should
62:12 - go back to our other screen
62:14 - okay cool it did
62:17 - oh no but we're automatically getting
62:18 - logged in
62:30 - and we're getting
62:31 - we're getting a warning
62:49 - okay let's
62:52 - i think warnings are okay uh and it
62:54 - won't like crash our app so i'm okay
62:56 - with that for right now
62:58 - if we get any
63:00 - any red colored notifications that are
63:02 - errors then i'll be more worried but i
63:04 - do want to see um
63:07 - so we we had the issue of the auto
63:09 - logging in happening
63:11 - and i want to want to make sure that
63:14 - we're not doing that anymore so
63:17 - we had that happening because of uh
63:23 - i believe it was
63:28 - notion login
63:32 - was it this one was automatically
63:34 - logging in
63:37 - i think it was
64:27 - all right let's see um
64:29 - let's see if this will work i'm i'm
64:32 - thinking that if we take out user and
64:35 - set user
64:36 - as
64:37 - things that we need to track in here
64:41 - that
64:43 - that might solve our our issue
64:49 - because this won't reset
64:52 - let's see
65:01 - all right cool so it didn't log us in
65:03 - let's submit this
65:05 - and let's log out
65:07 - cool
65:08 - all right so now
65:10 - everything was still saved which is
65:11 - actually pretty useful um
65:15 - and
65:16 - it's not it's not doing that so let's
65:19 - try to
65:21 - let's manually refresh
65:24 - just to verify
65:31 - all right and the thing is
65:33 - it's making us log in again
65:37 - we did want to avoid that
65:39 - we wanted to avoid having to log in
65:40 - again so i thought we had it
65:43 - we did have it set up so that if we had
65:46 - the device id we would get a new notion
65:49 - and we would set notion
65:57 - which that's actually kind of weird
65:59 - that our auto login is not working
66:03 - let's test this
66:04 - let's run on a web browser too because
66:06 - we had it working on a web browser
66:10 - can't be reached why not
66:34 - okay looks like it's got to build
66:36 - i wonder if i can run it on web and
66:39 - android at the same time
66:41 - all right so this is automatically
66:44 - linking
66:54 - it has it
67:05 - okay
67:08 - all right
67:14 - all right there is some weirdness going
67:16 - on with um
67:20 - automatically starting but at least like
67:22 - it does seem to be saving
67:25 - so it's it's saving the id which i'm
67:28 - okay with that
67:30 - if the user happens to have a password
67:32 - manager they can save their password
67:35 - so
67:36 - i'm okay with that for now
67:41 - all right oops i went over time i'm
67:43 - gonna go back to the chat now i
67:44 - apologize i totally lost track of time i
67:46 - shoulda i should have checked the chat
67:48 - like 10 minutes ago
67:49 - uh so let me go to the chat now and um
67:53 - take about five minutes here in the chat
67:57 - um
68:00 - hey david uh corbin's here he says hey
68:04 - jesse keep up the great work thanks man
68:06 - good to see you in here
68:08 - i work with david he is like a uh a
68:12 - kubernetes expert
68:17 - um
68:19 - moshiko says how do you manage to stay
68:20 - focused over time
68:22 - um
68:23 - i don't know uh
68:24 - i guess uh
68:27 - when i really need to stay focused like
68:28 - i'm gonna be honest i take um
68:31 - i take like a supplement called g fuel
68:33 - that's a bunch of b vitamins and like
68:36 - other vitamins and caffeine and it does
68:38 - help me stay focused so
68:41 - that's that's what i do when i really
68:42 - need to focus um other than that i
68:46 - i don't know i just like take breaks
68:48 - when i need to um
68:52 - yeah
68:54 - uh
68:57 - boym lol says how many years of
69:00 - experience do you have
69:03 - um
69:05 - i don't know it's been a lot it's been a
69:07 - long time it's been a long time
69:09 - maybe seven
69:10 - i'm trying to think back to when i
69:12 - started
69:13 - um
69:15 - from the time when like i actually
69:16 - started getting paid to do coding like
69:18 - consistently i'm gonna say like
69:21 - somewhere around sevenish years
69:27 - uh as she says uh it's my first live
69:30 - session on free code camp oh
69:31 - congratulations welcome thanks for
69:33 - watching
69:36 - uh
69:37 - gamm002 says how many hours of coding
69:39 - experience would you have approximately
69:41 - oh i i have no idea i'd have to do some
69:44 - serious math
69:45 - and an estimation work on that one i
69:48 - don't know i mean i guess like
69:51 - so if i've been coding for about seven
69:52 - years full time
69:55 - then
69:56 - i mean you figure i wouldn't say that i
69:59 - would have like 40 hours a week of
70:00 - coding because so much time is spent in
70:02 - meetings and things like that like
70:04 - let's just be like very conservative in
70:07 - our estimate and say estimate 20 hours a
70:09 - week coding
70:11 - let's factor in vacations and sick days
70:13 - let's say like
70:14 - 20 hours per week coding
70:17 - and 50 weeks a year
70:20 - for seven years
70:21 - so uh let me get my calculator out
70:24 - because i don't want to make
70:26 - simple math mistakes live on youtube
70:29 - right
70:30 - so
70:31 - let's do this 20
70:33 - times 50
70:35 - times seven
70:37 - uh all right we're going to say 7000
70:40 - coding hours
70:43 - so uh
70:45 - i guess that's a lot of hours
70:48 - right
70:49 - and i mean that's definitely a really
70:51 - big estimation right because
70:53 - there were probably some weeks when i
70:55 - did less than that and some weeks when i
70:57 - did more than that
70:59 - but
71:00 - that's my best estimate of of coding
71:03 - which
71:05 - i probably have done more than that
71:08 - because 20 hours a week is not really
71:10 - that much and there's been times when
71:12 - i've been working full-time coding and
71:14 - then also have an extra part-time
71:16 - project on the side
71:19 - but
71:21 - that's
71:22 - that's a decent estimate i'd say i have
71:24 - at least seven 000 coding hours
71:27 - at this point
71:30 - bart says hey from france hey how's it
71:32 - going
71:33 - uh i ir
71:35 - a ayr how do you pronounce ayr but
71:38 - anyway says what resources did you use
71:40 - to study um free code camp so free
71:43 - cocaine.org has a great curriculum
71:45 - which is i really like it i used that i
71:49 - used udacity has free code or free
71:52 - courses a lot of youtube videos
71:54 - there's a youtube channel called learn
71:56 - code academy that i really liked
71:59 - um
72:00 - there's a youtube channel called devtips
72:02 - that i liked to watch um
72:06 - let's see codecademy uh had some great
72:09 - free content
72:10 - and then of course like documentation
72:13 - um stack overflow
72:15 - uh articles and stuff mozilla developer
72:17 - network so those are all like my main my
72:19 - main
72:20 - resources uh
72:22 - yeah
72:24 - let's see and then actually like
72:26 - building projects is a great resource
72:30 - let's see opinion on types
72:33 - so meep says what's your opinion on
72:35 - typescript will it replace javascript in
72:37 - the next five years
72:39 - uh i don't think it will replace
72:40 - javascript like
72:43 - yeah i i mean i don't really know the
72:45 - numbers i haven't looked into it that
72:47 - much but i doubt that it will replace
72:49 - javascript
72:55 - charbelle says make a new timer yeah i
72:57 - could make a new timer somebody that
72:59 - used to watch the streams a lot his
73:00 - name's harshit um he made a uh a timer
73:04 - for me but i forgot the url so i just
73:07 - need to figure out what the url of it is
73:09 - and um and go to that timer that one
73:12 - always worked really well
73:16 - all right i'm gonna that was about five
73:19 - minutes of
73:20 - um
73:22 - chat so i'm gonna go back now because we
73:24 - we need to build now
73:26 - so the um
73:29 - i guess i should say like keeping the
73:31 - user logged in
73:32 - is not working exactly like we had it
73:34 - working before but it's
73:37 - it's still saving the id
73:40 - so
73:41 - i'm okay with that and then like i said
73:43 - if the user has some sort of password
73:44 - manager they could save their their
73:46 - other credentials in here and i think
73:48 - that would be okay
73:53 - maybe we could potentially give the user
73:55 - an option to stay completely logged in
73:57 - all the time on a future update
74:01 - but i don't want to make that the
74:02 - default
74:06 - so i'm going to leave it off for now
74:07 - plus i just really want to get this
74:09 - bundled up into the app store like i
74:11 - said we are having some error messages
74:13 - come up i shouldn't say air we're having
74:14 - some warnings come up
74:17 - which i'm okay with for now uh as
74:20 - because i don't think it'll crash our
74:22 - app
74:23 - i think we'll be we'll be all right so
74:24 - we're not having any crashes
74:26 - so um
74:28 - i think we're good to keep on on going
74:31 - let's do uh
74:35 - we're gonna have to save the changes
74:36 - that we just made
74:40 - we're gonna do an am flag for our commit
74:44 - and
74:46 - let's do
74:48 - fix because this was a bug um
74:54 - let's see
74:55 - take
75:03 - so
75:04 - i'm committing this and it says it's to
75:07 - take user back to login screen after
75:08 - logging out
75:10 - i'm going to push that
75:13 - if you want to see the code that i'm
75:14 - pushing
75:15 - then check out the github repo the links
75:17 - in the description
75:20 - all right let's go to
75:23 - i'm gonna
75:24 - shut down now our our expo server
75:28 - and close out
75:30 - i have a lot of windows here that are
75:32 - not necessary right now so
75:35 - i don't need this right now
75:38 - we did that
75:41 - um
75:45 - i don't think we need this
75:47 - and bundles
75:51 - i don't think we need this i'll keep it
75:53 - i must open it for a reason so i'm going
75:54 - to keep it up for now now we're going to
75:56 - do a build
75:57 - so let's run the expo build for android
76:04 - and then
76:05 - it looks like we're gonna have to answer
76:06 - some questions for this and let it run
76:09 - for a little bit and while it's running
76:10 - i can answer some more questions
76:12 - so we're gonna do expo build android
76:17 - and
76:19 - i guess we'll have to make a new expo
76:20 - account because i don't think i ever
76:22 - made one just crazy that i never made
76:23 - one because i've been using expo for
76:25 - years
76:26 - but i'm almost positive i do not have an
76:28 - account so let's make a new one
76:35 - it's cool that i don't have one because
76:36 - then we get to go over the whole process
76:37 - live
76:38 - username
76:40 - i'll just say j weigle
76:42 - and password
76:46 - i'm gonna make a password over here with
76:49 - lastpass so i can have lastpass generate
76:52 - secure passwords
77:04 - jay weigle already exists
77:06 - interesting
77:08 - let's see if i have an expo account
77:11 - uh
77:13 - expo dot io
77:15 - see if i can log in
77:17 - uh forgot
77:19 - password
77:20 - email
77:22 - jessie gmail.com
77:27 - all right i'm gonna open my email on
77:29 - another screen here
77:33 - evidently i do have an expo account
77:36 - well maybe i do maybe somebody just
77:40 - used the name jygo for an account
77:43 - well i do have a password
77:47 - so i'm going to reset my password here
77:49 - on this other screen
77:50 - and
77:52 - i'm going to use that new password that
77:54 - i just made
77:56 - and
77:56 - save password
78:00 - and i'm adding this account
78:02 - to
78:03 - lastpass so we'll have it
78:06 - cool
78:07 - let's log into my account
78:09 - [Music]
78:10 - suite i have no builds
78:16 - all right cool
78:18 - so let's try this now
78:21 - and let's pick the right answer log in
78:24 - with existing account
78:27 - uh
78:29 - jay weigl
78:31 - here's the password
78:35 - sweet
78:37 - let expo handle the process definitely
78:44 - build ios bundle i said android
78:49 - set expo debug true in your dev
78:51 - environment to view the stack chase what
78:53 - happened
78:55 - [Music]
79:04 - hmm maybe i hit the wrong
79:08 - did i hit the wrong thing
79:14 - oh okay once
79:16 - i thought it would just automatically
79:17 - pick that
79:18 - uh answer
79:21 - is one
79:21 - gonna work no it said false
79:24 - why did it say false all right what am i
79:26 - doing wrong here everybody
79:30 - let's make this bigger
79:36 - all right so it says
79:38 - let's try this again
79:40 - expo build android
79:45 - just there's a new version of expo cli
79:48 - available like we literally just
79:51 - installed this globally how did we get
79:53 - the older version
79:58 - all right let's do this let's get the
79:59 - new version first of all
80:03 - well let's try to npm install it this
80:05 - time how about that
80:08 - we used yarn before
80:10 - maybe
80:12 - maybe i had installed it with npm
80:14 - originally and for some reason it's
80:16 - using that one instead of the yarn one
80:19 - i mean you all saw me
80:21 - not that long ago install this so
80:26 - while that's going
80:27 - then we will
80:31 - let me double check
80:34 - so
80:35 - start the build
80:37 - expo build android right
81:00 - okay
81:01 - um
81:03 - wow this is taking
81:08 - well we'll see let me go to the chat
81:11 - i'll answer some questions and then if i
81:14 - get through all the questions and we're
81:15 - still not finished with this then we'll
81:17 - we'll handle that if it happens
81:28 - um
81:31 - we have a question that says
81:34 - can can you loop through an array of
81:35 - audio files hello from france hey how's
81:38 - it going
81:39 - um
81:40 - i'm assuming you can loop through an
81:42 - array of anything
81:45 - i'm not sure like how the audio files
81:48 - are
81:51 - like the format or anything like i don't
81:53 - have experience with that but if you
81:54 - have an array like i'm assuming you can
81:56 - loop through it
82:01 - um valentino says what's a brain
82:03 - computer
82:06 - jj says what's a computer this is the
82:09 - brain computer
82:11 - it
82:12 - reads your brain waves
82:14 - and then sends them wherever you want
82:15 - them to go like in terms of to an app or
82:18 - a website or something like that
82:21 - you can learn more about this i did a
82:23 - video review on my youtube channel the
82:24 - links in the description for my channel
82:26 - so you can check out to learn more it's
82:28 - called the notion and it's built by a
82:30 - company called nerosity
82:39 - wizock says react native was fun but
82:41 - flutter was better i haven't i haven't
82:43 - had a chance to use flutter yet i've
82:45 - heard good things about it um still
82:47 - using react native so um
82:50 - yeah can't really comment too much on
82:51 - that but
82:53 - um
82:54 - yeah i've
82:55 - what do you all think about flutter i
82:57 - don't want to start a battle between
82:58 - react david and flutter because i think
82:59 - they're both good
83:01 - um but what a if if any of y'all have
83:03 - used it you know what do you think
83:05 - uh tasha says what database are you
83:07 - using currently i have no database set
83:09 - up for this particular app uh so
83:12 - no no database um i don't know what th
83:15 - the neurosc device
83:17 - is has like its own um operating system
83:22 - and server and they they might have a
83:25 - database running on here and i don't
83:26 - know what it is but
83:28 - um
83:29 - in terms of like what we built for this
83:31 - app i don't have anything uh for a
83:34 - database
83:38 - arif says why why am i here
83:41 - uh obviously because you wanted to watch
83:43 - some code right or it was an accident in
83:46 - which case welcome and
83:48 - feel free to ask any questions if you
83:50 - have them
83:52 - uh lrj says i am human uh excellent so
83:56 - am i
84:01 - dl
84:02 - td says y'all so smart wish i can catch
84:04 - up oh don't worry about it we're not
84:08 - it's
84:08 - this is the fifth stream that we've done
84:11 - so like uh if if you if anybody can like
84:14 - jump right in and understand what's
84:15 - going on at this point then you have to
84:17 - be like very smart and experienced at
84:18 - this so um
84:20 - feel free to ask as many questions as
84:22 - you can
84:23 - or as you want to um
84:26 - and
84:27 - you know go back and you'll watch the
84:28 - previous streams definitely recommend
84:30 - watching them at double speed that'll
84:32 - help you to catch up
84:34 - and
84:35 - i i think the streams are easier to
84:37 - watch in double speed like i i talk kind
84:39 - of slowly i take my time so
84:42 - double speed is better
84:45 - [Music]
84:47 - uh pap stew says can you suggest to me
84:50 - some good channels or websites for
84:51 - android development i don't know too
84:54 - much about specifically android
84:55 - development uh he says using java or
84:58 - kotlin
85:00 - yeah i don't know for sure
85:02 - so um
85:04 - i know the free codecamp youtube channel
85:06 - that i'm on right now does have some
85:09 - videos about different types of
85:11 - development so we probably have
85:13 - something about java and kotlin so i'd
85:14 - check that out other than that though i
85:16 - don't really
85:17 - know too much about
85:20 - resources for that
85:27 - let's see
85:33 - a few people join saying hello so hey
85:35 - how's it going
85:40 - uh xx snooki says do you have any tips
85:44 - for people learning c sharp
85:47 - uh
85:48 - not really
85:50 - what is this telling me
85:53 - let's
86:00 - i'm gonna close this since we can't
86:01 - connect to the server anymore so
86:04 - there we go
86:13 - there we go
86:14 - closing
86:16 - closing a few things
86:17 - i thought it just occurred to me that
86:19 - hey if i close all this other stuff
86:20 - maybe this will install more quickly so
86:23 - actually it did so let's uh let's try to
86:25 - run
86:27 - let's try to run this again see if we're
86:30 - on the right version now and if that
86:32 - makes a difference
86:34 - right because if if we're using the
86:35 - latest instructions it's possible that
86:37 - because i was on an old version that's
86:39 - why it wasn't working i i don't know
86:41 - it's just a thought
86:44 - um
86:45 - i want to
86:47 - see
86:48 - answer so i'm trying to go up and down
86:51 - to see if i can
86:54 - change this like up and down but that's
86:56 - not working
86:57 - so i guess
87:00 - let expo handle the process
87:03 - let's see
87:08 - huh
87:13 - why is it doing this
87:16 - all right we're gonna we're gonna have
87:17 - to go into um
87:23 - go into research mode here for for a
87:25 - minute
87:26 - uh so let's see
87:32 - and one thing i don't understand is why
87:34 - it keeps trying to build the ios bundle
87:36 - when we're trying to just do android
87:43 - let's see what we can get
87:46 - alright cool
88:02 - okay
88:03 - looks like we need to start expo
88:06 - so let's run expo
88:14 - kind of odd i would have thought we
88:15 - didn't want it running when we do the
88:16 - build but i guess that is not the case
88:18 - so we want to and that this makes sense
88:21 - right if it's trying to connect
88:25 - then we definitely want it running
88:27 - alright cool so let's try it again
88:53 - i still
88:54 - i don't like that it automatically put
88:56 - in false for me here
89:06 - because i think i need the keystore
89:12 - so while this is doing its thing i want
89:14 - to look
89:15 - um
89:19 - look this up and see if anybody else is
89:21 - having issues with that
89:45 - hmm
90:02 - this up already
90:41 - all right well i guess
90:44 - when this is all over we'll try to grab
90:46 - our key store see if it exists otherwise
90:48 - we have to figure something out for our
90:50 - key store
90:51 - it seems like as long as we can
90:59 - when we have to upload
91:03 - otherwise feel free to upload your own
91:11 - that's weird
91:17 - oh well
91:19 - all right while that's happening
91:22 - let's let me go back to the chat
91:27 - [Music]
91:28 - all right the last question was uh do
91:30 - you have any tips for people learning c
91:31 - sharp
91:32 - um i don't really know i guess um
91:35 - just similar tips for learning anything
91:37 - try to do a little bit with it every day
91:39 - uh just keep on like try to try to build
91:42 - real projects with it
91:48 - one future says how can i improve redux
91:52 - skill example or project redux is hard
91:54 - i'm a junior front end deaf
91:56 - yeah i guess um for redux try to start
92:00 - out with something very simple because
92:01 - redux is difficult so try to start out
92:04 - with a simple project once you see it
92:06 - all working together on a project it
92:08 - gets a lot easier
92:10 - uh but you know i definitely
92:12 - try to find some sort of tutorial
92:14 - that'll give you a very simple project
92:16 - um you know you can check out like the
92:18 - redux documentation and go through that
92:20 - it's
92:21 - it redux is going to take a while for
92:23 - you to understand it's just kind of
92:25 - difficult at first
92:26 - so uh don't be discouraged if it's if
92:29 - it's taking a while
92:30 - like it's it is complex
92:37 - solo code ninja says hello brother hey
92:39 - how's it going
92:42 - xero says uh you can build ios apps on a
92:45 - pc no i don't think you can
92:47 - i think you could just build um android
92:50 - although expo might let you build like
92:56 - maybe expo like build it on their
92:58 - servers i'm not really sure how that'll
93:00 - work with with expo but i'm um
93:03 - i'm worried about building the
93:06 - android stuff right now i assumed i
93:09 - would have to switch to my my mac to do
93:11 - the ios stuff
93:19 - uh zanik says uh
93:21 - what up can you do html please i don't
93:24 - do much like straight html uh on on my
93:27 - live streams
93:29 - uh mostly i'm doing react native
93:31 - nowadays
93:33 - chinmay says uh how much did it cost oh
93:36 - the i assume you're talking about this
93:38 - spring computer interface i believe it
93:39 - was like a thousand dollars somewhere
93:41 - around there
93:42 - um this was like one of like the first
93:44 - test devices i don't know what the
93:46 - retail price is going to be once they
93:48 - they actually have them
93:50 - available
93:53 - like the finished product available
94:00 - chinmay says flutter is amazing still
94:01 - growing
94:02 - yeah that's what i thought too like i
94:04 - think flutter will be
94:06 - a legitimate like competitor to react
94:09 - native or i don't want to say competitor
94:11 - because
94:12 - that's like the wrong way to look at it
94:14 - i think it'll be
94:15 - a more legitimate option once the
94:18 - community grows
94:20 - right one thing i think react native has
94:23 - that flutter doesn't yet just because
94:25 - it's a lot older is a much bigger
94:27 - ecosystem more packages available
94:31 - and
94:32 - flutter will flutter will get there
94:34 - right as long as it keeps getting
94:36 - growing
94:37 - and more people using it it'll get there
94:39 - it's just it takes time
94:42 - so
94:43 - i think
94:44 - right now
94:45 - the flutter ecosystem is just
94:48 - it's just not quite as big right and i
94:51 - mean that comes with there's good and
94:53 - bad about that like if you want to get
94:54 - in and really have an impact on an
94:56 - ecosystem it's way easier to get in on
94:58 - an early ecosystem like flutter than it
95:01 - is on something like react native
95:02 - but if you just want to get in and build
95:04 - stuff
95:05 - the odds of you finding ready-made
95:08 - a you know examples and libraries to do
95:10 - what you want to do on a younger project
95:13 - are lower than on an older project so it
95:16 - just it really depends on what you want
95:17 - to do
95:21 - chinmace is waiting for webrtc on
95:23 - flutter good so like that's a good
95:24 - example it's just
95:27 - depending on what you want to do
95:29 - it may not be available for a younger
95:31 - project
95:32 - it's not to say it's a bad project it's
95:34 - just
95:35 - it's going to take time for people to
95:37 - start developing all the things that
95:39 - they need
95:43 - let's see
95:52 - let's see
95:56 - mr now now
95:58 - i'm not sure to pronounce your name
95:59 - apologies for that says uh what about
96:02 - algo should i have to learn it before
96:04 - studying programming
96:05 - you mean like algorithms
96:08 - no you definitely don't need to learn
96:09 - that before you start programming um you
96:12 - can start building stuff without that
96:15 - cmo says how to learn spring boots
96:18 - i don't know because i don't really know
96:20 - it a lot of people that i work with use
96:22 - it
96:23 - but i i don't know very much about it at
96:25 - all
96:26 - if anybody else knows more about it
96:28 - please let us know in the chat
96:31 - um
96:32 - mag mala says
96:34 - bruh i just learned drop down menus on
96:37 - html this is definitely out of my range
96:40 - oh
96:41 - well
96:42 - feel free to ask questions and watch if
96:45 - you want to i understand if it's if it's
96:47 - a little out of your range but uh
96:49 - congrats on learning drop down menus and
96:52 - uh that's that's definitely a good skill
96:54 - to have when building websites
96:56 - um but yeah i i really hope that these
96:59 - streams will be good for people at any
97:01 - skill level
97:03 - because i i do my best to explain what's
97:05 - happening
97:06 - and
97:08 - i do take any questions so
97:10 - uh i guess
97:12 - you don't don't try not to feel
97:13 - intimidated if you're just starting out
97:15 - and i'm happy to explain what's going
97:18 - on uh vivec says will you do any machine
97:21 - learning projects on the live stream
97:23 - i might
97:24 - i might we'll just see you know how this
97:26 - goes i think
97:27 - the data from the brain computer
97:29 - interface
97:30 - you could do some really cool machine
97:32 - learning stuff with that
97:33 - so i'm thinking like
97:35 - that's a possibility at some point and
97:38 - there's some other things that
97:40 - i think could be cool with machine
97:41 - learning that i'd like to do so i don't
97:43 - have any plans to do it in the immediate
97:45 - future but
97:47 - you know it is on my mind for some some
97:49 - projects that i've thought of
97:51 - uh brian says love from kenya love
97:53 - coding oh awesome thank you
98:02 - uh adrian says what react redux package
98:05 - is the best easy peasy
98:08 - um
98:10 - i'm not sure what you mean by react
98:12 - redux package
98:14 - if i i guess if i were to start out
98:16 - i would use create react app
98:19 - to uh to get started
98:21 - i believe there's now a react
98:25 - redux starter with create react app
98:27 - where it'll
98:28 - it'll scaffold out a react app with
98:31 - redux already kind of connected i
98:33 - haven't used it yet i just read about it
98:35 - so if i remember correctly i think that
98:38 - that is out there now that would
98:40 - probably be the best way to get started
98:41 - with reactant redux
98:50 - okay i can monitor the progress of the
98:52 - build at the url
98:56 - which i think i already have that open
98:57 - though right
98:59 - [Music]
99:01 - sweet
99:05 - build details
99:07 - building
99:09 - creating key store keystore created
99:11 - successfully key source and sources oh
99:13 - cool so evidently we did get the
99:15 - keystore created
99:17 - somehow although it was not obvious from
99:20 - here
99:21 - so
99:22 - let's let's check out some of the info
99:24 - we're getting from this so we're not
99:26 - really getting great info in the console
99:29 - which is cool they got this this thing
99:31 - here so
99:33 - um
99:35 - let's see so we got the keystore
99:36 - starting the build process
99:38 - icon setup
99:42 - native modules
99:46 - whoa
99:49 - whoa build is finished
99:50 - sweet
99:53 - nice build successful
99:56 - so cool all right
99:58 - let's download it
100:03 - get the apk
100:05 - very nice
100:06 - and it's uploaded now to
100:08 - s3
100:11 - very cool
100:14 - all right so let's let's go to the next
100:16 - step here
100:18 - um all right so we've built
100:21 - it's finished building
100:24 - let's test it
100:25 - to run it on your android device make
100:27 - sure you have android platform tools
100:28 - installed along with adb and then just
100:30 - run adb install
100:33 - with usb debugging all right i'm gonna
100:35 - plug my device in
100:38 - and then i'm gonna try to install this
100:40 - that we've just made
100:44 - on my android device
100:47 - and uh
100:50 - let's see
100:53 - i need to need to plug it in
100:56 - in the back of my
101:00 - computer so i i forgot to bring i was
101:03 - going to
101:03 - switch this up
101:07 - and have a
101:09 - usbc cable
101:10 - but i forgot to bring it
101:14 - so now i need to
101:15 - find my
101:17 - other cable that is usb on one end and
101:19 - usbc on the other end
101:24 - all right found it i need to unplug
101:26 - something
101:28 - that
101:29 - is in
101:34 - hopefully y'all heard what i was saying
101:36 - i was in front of the mic but
101:39 - okay
101:44 - all right
101:45 - plugging that in
101:49 - [Music]
101:51 - and
101:54 - and i do have a robe on it's cold in my
101:56 - basement so
101:58 - it's not it's not that professional but
101:59 - this is how i
102:01 - i like the streams to be authentic and
102:02 - this is how i often code so
102:05 - it is authentic
102:07 - all right so i have that plugged in now
102:09 - i need to
102:11 - run
102:12 - the
102:13 - adb install sweet so let me move
102:21 - let me get rid of that let's turn that
102:23 - off and i'm just going to go out
102:33 - downloads
102:35 - and let's see what we called it
102:39 - stay focused with all kinds of stuff so
102:42 - let's see
102:44 - adb install and then the file name so
102:46 - let's let's do that
103:00 - i'm pretty sure i had adb
103:03 - working
103:05 - adb
103:08 - huh
103:11 - i thought i ran an adb command not that
103:12 - long ago all right let's see
103:16 - how do i get adb to install the
103:21 - android platform tools
103:25 - let me open up my android studio
103:54 - tools
104:09 - all right let me let me do a little
104:11 - search here
104:14 - what was it called
104:16 - android platform tools
104:35 - she get the latest sdk platform tools
104:37 - for interest us sdk manager
104:48 - all right so android studio has an sdk
104:51 - manager let's see if we can
104:54 - and from the sdk manager
104:57 - we can get to tools
105:20 - see how this goes
105:36 - i should have gotten these
105:38 - when i downloaded
105:46 - i downloaded this so
105:52 - let me see if anybody
106:00 - oh barratt says maybe you installed adb
106:02 - for windows system but not for ubuntu
106:09 - yeah
106:11 - that's possible let's see
106:27 - oh sdk tools
106:46 - android sdk command line tools it said
106:48 - not installed so let's let's try to
106:51 - download this
107:14 - cool
107:16 - that's kind of odd
107:17 - i would think something like that like
107:19 - should have been the default
107:21 - but
107:22 - i guess not
107:28 - all right cool that was fast
107:31 - all right now let's see i might have to
107:34 - restart the terminal
107:38 - yeah or just start a new one let's see
107:41 - if i got
107:44 - see
107:56 - adb hmm
108:05 - try
108:05 - i doubt it would work in my linux
108:07 - subsystem
108:15 - hmm
108:23 - oops that was accident
108:27 - um
108:30 - maybe i'll just try to do it this way
108:35 - see if it works
108:57 - i thought i just did this
109:12 - oh it already exists
109:14 - why didn't it not
109:16 - write in an update
109:22 - that's sweet
109:29 - oh there we go
109:37 - now how do i install that
109:43 - uh cmo says add adb in variable
109:46 - environment
110:00 - um
110:27 - i wonder if i actually have access to
110:29 - any of the android tools
110:36 - that's very weird
110:46 - nothing
110:51 - man it says add to environment path
111:11 - let's see
111:22 - all right
111:23 - add adb
111:29 - all right let's see
111:41 - all right cool let's try this
111:48 - open windows explorer
111:52 - right click my pc
111:58 - properties
112:03 - advanced system settings
112:06 - environment variables
112:11 - we got
112:15 - path
112:17 - double click it
112:21 - okay
112:29 - browse
112:32 - whoops
112:39 - see program files adb fast
112:56 - oh
113:06 - hmm
113:50 - hmm
113:51 - i'm not seeing
113:54 - where to add this
114:06 - hmm
114:13 - oh man just copy the downloaded folder
114:15 - path and add us a new path
114:18 - oh that's right we did download that
114:48 - okay all right that'll add it to windows
115:02 - path oh okay i totally didn't see this
115:05 - first section
115:14 - that seems like the easier one
115:24 - but it looks like we don't have the exes
115:26 - we just have the dlls
115:29 - unless um
115:31 - oh actually
115:34 - fastboot adb application
115:38 - yeah we could copy that to
115:41 - c windows and it should be good to go
115:43 - from the command line
115:49 - actually let's do that
115:52 - let's just copy
115:54 - i'm going to copy those and then
116:00 - windows
116:02 - oops no no no cancel that
116:15 - all right so either way
116:16 - that should work at least for the
116:18 - windows part
116:19 - which is fine because i'll do
116:22 - a command prompt and let's see if we can
116:23 - do it now
116:25 - adb yes it works
116:31 - all right cool so we got a lot of stuff
116:33 - going on here okay
116:38 - oh goodness
116:42 - okay so
116:44 - back to
116:46 - where we need to go for
116:51 - there we go
116:56 - ah no i forget it's this actually let me
116:59 - look here
117:03 - cool i have adb here as well which is
117:05 - sweet so i'm already in the downloads
117:06 - here so let's just rerun this command
117:09 - that we just ran
117:12 - cool
117:13 - so this should perform an install
117:18 - on my phone
117:22 - success all right so how do i actually
117:24 - run this then
117:35 - hmm
118:01 - all right let's verify
118:08 - okay so i have a device
118:23 - oh
118:36 - hmm
118:50 - it says it's installed but i don't
118:52 - i didn't see anything happen
118:56 - on my phone
119:16 - interesting
119:19 - okay
119:22 - let's troubleshoot that then
119:32 - uh
120:06 - okay let's see
120:11 - madness says it's much easier to have a
120:13 - copy of the apk on your phone and then
120:15 - install it manually
120:17 - i could probably do it through uh google
120:19 - drive right
120:24 - you could upload the apk
120:34 - i'll do that
120:36 - on my other screen i'm just uploading
120:38 - the apk
121:01 - oh there we go it works
121:09 - it's in the process of uploading i guess
121:11 - i'll start it on my device in
121:17 - all right cool so it uploaded
121:19 - let's go to google drive
121:24 - i mean i would like to know why it's not
121:26 - working but you know just to get this
121:28 - started
121:29 - we can do the upload here
121:33 - let's see
121:35 - where's my google drive
121:52 - i'm gonna download this
121:56 - downloading it to my device now
122:10 - cool download worked
122:20 - all right
122:22 - i'm installing
122:32 - so we'll say as i'm installing this
122:34 - twice it opened just to give me like
122:36 - security warnings because this three
122:38 - times
122:39 - um
122:41 - it's it said there's security warnings
122:43 - here
122:44 - but it's opening so i don't know if you
122:46 - can see that
122:47 - it is open on my machine
122:50 - so um
122:52 - that's that's pretty cool let's uh
122:57 - i guess i
122:58 - can i'm going to try to run this on my
123:02 - device so i'm going to copy and paste my
123:05 - um
123:09 - my key or my like my device id
123:12 - into google keep so that i can easily
123:15 - copy and paste it into my phone
123:18 - and try it on my phone
123:20 - [Music]
123:27 - let's see
123:32 - cool google keep syncs very quickly
123:37 - it's really good for this kind of stuff
123:40 - all right i pasted that in let's put my
123:42 - email in
123:44 - and uh password i'll go into my lastpass
123:48 - and say
123:50 - nope i need
123:58 - um
124:03 - nerosity
124:09 - all right hopefully this is the right
124:10 - password
124:15 - nice
124:31 - all right cool so it's working
124:33 - so obviously i'm getting it's vibrating
124:35 - i know if you can hear that
124:38 - you can hear that on the mic now it's
124:40 - vibrating and uh i don't have the
124:42 - headset on so obviously like i'm not
124:44 - focused right and it's giving me this
124:46 - red this red message sweet i'm gonna log
124:49 - out now so it stops with all this
124:51 - vibrating
124:52 - oh no i logged out and it's still
124:54 - vibrating in red
124:56 - that's a bug
125:01 - but at least the vibrating only goes on
125:03 - for
125:04 - maybe like 10 seconds at the most maybe
125:07 - less than that
125:08 - uh but
125:10 - all right that's cool
125:16 - all right very cool
125:17 - so it works and uh
125:20 - i believe i have like a stay focused
125:23 - icon now in my phone which is really
125:26 - sweet
125:27 - see if i could find it
125:32 - yeah this so the little sf isn't an icon
125:34 - very cool
125:36 - all right so that works
125:38 - i'm going to
125:40 - go through the next step now of um
125:44 - let's get rid of this
125:46 - and
125:49 - submit it
125:50 - uploading apps
126:02 - so
126:04 - to upload the previously built
126:05 - standalone adapter apps where you simply
126:06 - run expo upload android
126:10 - uh but i thought we have to do
126:15 - we have to create an account download
126:17 - this json private key after that you
126:19 - have to create an app on google click
126:20 - console and upload your app manually at
126:21 - least once all right so we got to go to
126:23 - google play console
126:27 - which
126:28 - cool
126:33 - now i already signed up for an account
126:35 - on here so
126:38 - you would have to do that step let's
126:40 - create an app we're gonna call it stay
126:42 - focused
126:53 - short description
127:07 - alert you when you start to lose focus
127:10 - and the full description is
127:13 - works with the
127:17 - generosity
127:19 - motion
127:24 - q2
127:33 - there you go
127:40 - current level of focus
127:49 - [Music]
128:05 - nice vibrates all right cool
128:09 - all right
128:10 - graphic assets
128:21 - screenshots
128:24 - all right we gotta add at least one
128:26 - phone screenshot
128:27 - [Music]
128:29 - all right
128:30 - well
128:32 - i guess i'll uh take a screenshot from
128:34 - my phone then and
128:37 - download that
128:49 - all right all right i guess i'll upload
128:51 - the screenshot to
128:54 - um my google drive so that i can get it
128:57 - back down there
129:05 - [Music]
129:13 - all right i know it's been a while since
129:14 - i've gotten to the chat so i'll get back
129:16 - to the chat in just a minute
129:18 - let's try to get this screenshot
129:21 - uploaded
129:27 - all right so the screenshot's being
129:29 - uploaded to google drive i got my drive
129:31 - open on my other windows so i should be
129:33 - able to see when it gets there yep it's
129:35 - there
129:36 - now i'm going to download that
129:37 - screenshot
129:44 - and should be able to
129:49 - there we go
129:51 - uh oh need to resize your screenshot
129:59 - uh okay
130:01 - it's too big
130:05 - feature graphic
130:10 - goodness i need all this stuff
130:13 - to application
130:18 - productivity
130:21 - content rating
130:29 - man there's a lot of stuff to do this
130:32 - all right well let's just keep going
130:33 - then
130:35 - all right
130:36 - uh hi-rez icon let's see if we can use
130:39 - that uh icon that we created
130:47 - dimensions required are 5 12 by 5 12. uh
130:51 - okay
130:53 - so
130:55 - let's take
131:02 - pixlr
131:05 - [Music]
131:08 - all right so if i'm just resizing stuff
131:10 - i like to use pixlr
131:14 - i can figure out how to get logon pixlr
131:17 - editor
131:21 - which one is the
131:27 - i don't remember this is different than
131:29 - what i
131:31 - was looking for
131:32 - maybe
131:36 - open image
131:38 - let's open this one
131:41 - image
131:42 - image size
131:48 - there we go
132:11 - all right
132:12 - hopefully that'll work
132:24 - so this is probably boring
132:26 - i didn't realize uh
132:28 - how much was involved and now this one
132:30 - needs to be
132:32 - minimum length 320.
132:37 - interesting
132:38 - all right
132:39 - at least two screenshots are required
132:48 - oh we need at least two huh all right
132:52 - well i guess i'll take another one then
132:55 - let me do one logged out i guess there
132:58 - we go
133:02 - um
133:27 - okay
133:29 - so
133:30 - let's go into the editor then and uh
133:34 - let's get a new image
133:37 - and
133:41 - i'm gonna upload this image so we got
133:43 - this screenshot
133:49 - uh yeah we want a new size and it needs
133:52 - to be
133:53 - what was it three
134:01 - minimum length for any side 320
134:04 - max length for any size
134:06 - 3840
134:09 - so what do what do we have
134:18 - that seems like it fit though didn't it
134:25 - let's try that again because um
134:29 - it's between 320 pixels and 3840 pixels
134:35 - let's try that let's try that again
134:38 - see what it says you need to resize your
134:41 - screenshot
134:44 - max aspect ratio two to one maybe when
134:47 - maybe we're not hitting the aspect ratio
134:55 - let's see image size
135:04 - um
135:13 - let's see if we can
135:17 - google play
135:30 - uh let's see
135:36 - let's see if we got something that will
135:37 - do it for us app screenshot builder
135:40 - i don't want to create an account
135:49 - no no
135:57 - all right let's see
136:00 - uh harish says
136:02 - use bulk resize photos.com
136:05 - okay i'll try that
136:21 - actually what about this one
136:34 - cool
137:11 - see this is cool now what can i do with
137:13 - this
137:24 - if this worked that's going to be
137:27 - that's gonna be sweet
137:28 - all right
137:29 - let's open this
137:31 - and
137:33 - extract to
137:35 - download screenshots okay

140:50 - no i don't want to leave this thing
140:52 - all right let's save draft now i would
140:54 - hate to actually lose anything we've
140:56 - done here
140:57 - all right so so far i think we've got
140:59 - everything
141:01 - that we need up to here
141:03 - i guess we don't need tags
141:06 - content rating
141:08 - what are we gonna do here
141:12 - you must upload an apk before taking the
141:15 - content rating questionnaire okay
141:17 - that looks good that's good then
141:19 - so we'll skip that for now
141:22 - website i don't have a website please
141:24 - provide an email address
141:26 - there we go phone number hey now you all
141:29 - know my phone number

141:36 - if you wish pride policy policy please
141:38 - send it below

141:53 - where can i upload this apk
141:59 - did i miss it
142:08 - hmm
142:43 - let's do a beta release i'm guessing a
142:45 - beta release would have less
142:49 - restrictions
143:10 - i don't know let me see
143:13 - for production
143:22 - all right let me go back i'm gonna go
143:24 - back to the chat before i do anything
143:26 - else just to see if anybody has anything
143:28 - like to say about this particular
143:30 - process right here
143:34 - let's see
143:53 - oh haru says you could use a policy
143:55 - generator and add the google doc link
143:58 - oh that's a great idea
144:02 - let's do that
144:21 - oh
144:34 - yes
144:42 - i don't have a company name

147:48 - let's just put this in
147:55 - a google doc
148:08 - blank
148:29 - awesome that was a good idea
148:33 - let's let's go to the store listing and
148:36 - now we'll add in a privacy policy
148:41 - save that as a draft
148:42 - okay excellent
148:48 - now i need to
148:52 - i need to figure out i guess i gotta go
148:54 - to the app releases
148:58 - all right
149:01 - for internal testing within minutes
149:12 - i mean
149:13 - how
149:18 - i just wonder which one would be the
149:19 - best to do
149:21 - so did the google lock let me see let me
149:23 - go back to expo and see
149:29 - api access create a service account
149:31 - create new project
149:40 - all right
149:44 - let's do the api access and create a
149:46 - service account
150:02 - pretty i'm not sure if i was
150:04 - allowed
150:05 - to
150:08 - uh have this this looks like the public
150:11 - key
150:14 - so i guess it's fine that's in there
150:16 - um
150:28 - come here baby
150:30 - you want to say hello
150:36 - hey
150:38 - i'm building an app

150:50 - how you doing today
150:51 - good good
150:53 - you say hi to everybody hi
150:58 - all right
151:03 - let's see daddy one of these
151:08 - what are these
151:11 - daddy what are these what are those
151:14 - that's a brain computer you want to wear
151:16 - it yeah
151:18 - it'll read your brain what do you think
151:22 - see you want to see it on the screen
151:23 - yeah
151:25 - all right
151:25 - look
151:34 - all right let's show you brainwash
151:38 - cool
151:38 - let's show this right now look this is
151:40 - uh cordelia my daughter is wearing the
151:42 - headset and this is these are her
151:44 - brainwaves
151:46 - well they were until i moved the screen
151:48 - let's start it again
151:51 - uh
151:52 - did something happen
151:58 - see if the signal quality is okay
152:10 - it's probably too big let me shorten it
152:12 - up for you baby
152:13 - okay there we go all right put your head
152:16 - put your head down there we go
152:19 - okay
152:21 - let's see if we get some better signals
152:23 - here
152:26 - your hair's a lot longer than mine too
152:30 - might be a problem
152:33 - hope it's almost out of batteries i left
152:35 - it on this whole time
152:37 - there you go we got some brainwaves oh
152:39 - we got a little bit
152:44 - got a little bit going on i don't know
152:46 - what the problem is
152:48 - how to refresh
152:53 - [Music]
152:56 - there we go
153:03 - that's crazy your brainwaves look pretty
153:05 - crazy huh
153:12 - what's your brain doing
153:15 - taking
153:16 - food from my
153:18 - belly you want to put this on crooked
153:20 - too i think
153:24 - there we go it's probably going to run
153:26 - out of batteries but that's kind of cool
153:28 - yeah i'll put this on the other screen
153:29 - and you can see
153:31 - you can keep looking at it how about
153:32 - that
153:34 - and they keep looking at your brain what
153:36 - it's doing making all those colors
153:40 - okay so
153:42 - anyway i followed a couple of links and
153:44 - got to this in terms of like the first
153:45 - thing so i guess there's two things to
153:47 - do one is create this account and then
153:50 - that way we don't have to keep manually
153:51 - uploading we can just use the expo
153:53 - command line to do it
153:58 - then we can
154:01 - then we can do the manual upload for the
154:03 - first time so
154:05 - let's do these steps
154:07 - and
154:09 - you know what's going to be crazy is
154:10 - after all of this
154:12 - we're still not going to have the app
154:14 - ready until they actually do the review
154:16 - so it'll take
154:18 - um
154:18 - a while
154:20 - before we get it actually in the uh in
154:23 - the app store i want to close out
154:26 - all these that we're not using now
154:29 - ah let's see
154:30 - [Music]
154:39 - okay
154:44 - okay
154:46 - all right let's see
154:50 - settings api access create service
154:52 - account let's just let's split the
154:54 - screen here so we can
154:57 - follow the instructions

160:48 - manager
160:51 - so
160:56 - role is release manager
160:59 - i guess i'm just going to keep the
161:00 - defaults
161:02 - and add a user
161:09 - all right cool
161:13 - now
161:14 - we can manually upload
161:17 - so let's go to
161:19 - the manual upload instructions
161:26 - so many instructions i definitely need
161:27 - to do this again like very quickly with
161:30 - like make another app because otherwise
161:32 - i will forget so much of this i do have
161:34 - some other apps that i never quite got
161:37 - finished maybe i'll try to finish them
161:38 - and do it
161:40 - what's the matter it won't turn on
161:42 - oh you know what because i i turned off
161:44 - the power strip because the fish tank
161:46 - was being really noisy
161:48 - why don't you go upstairs and play on
161:49 - the chromebook
161:52 - you want to see if you can play on the
161:53 - chromebook
161:55 - no you want to go tell the other kids
161:57 - that i'm i build an app
161:59 - for the phone

162:01 - no
162:04 - oops
162:07 - you want to play something
162:09 - go see if rafael will let you play the

162:12 - you'll see if he'll turn it on for you
162:14 - you play mario
162:19 - tell him i told you too
162:29 - all right let's see
162:32 - get your app ready for testing your
162:34 - productions
162:37 - all right so we did the create
162:38 - application
162:43 - take the content rating questionnaire
162:44 - and set up
162:46 - so i believe we created the store
162:48 - listing
162:51 - right so we did all that next steps take
162:53 - the content rating questionnaire
162:59 - so how do we do it
163:06 - all right sign it in place select an app
163:12 - all right let's go into our play console
163:14 - we'll move it over here
163:16 - select an app
163:19 - stay focused
163:20 - hey
163:22 - now on the left menu click store
163:24 - presence
163:26 - content content rating
163:31 - you must upload before taking questions
163:34 - all right well i guess we gotta upload
163:35 - then
163:41 - let's
163:43 - it's very odd to
163:45 - manage apk files
163:47 - [Music]
163:54 - all right well i guess let's let's do
163:56 - the releases then
163:58 - and uh
164:02 - production track
164:07 - you have released it hasn't been rolled
164:09 - out
164:32 - i which one is this the key that
164:36 - we created
164:47 - uh dimitri says you need to do
164:49 - everything that's more called the gray
164:50 - checkbox
165:07 - step requirement if you're using the
165:08 - recommended app publishing format to
165:10 - android bundle
165:12 - yeah i mean i think i'll go with that
165:14 - one then
165:22 - okay on the left hand side oh thank you
165:24 - dimitri so demetrius everything that has
165:25 - this little gray checkbox needs to be
165:27 - done before we can distribute the app
165:29 - thank you that's very helpful
165:32 - all right so let's accept that
165:38 - cool
165:41 - let's browse files
165:43 - and get this apk
166:03 - see what this is
166:22 - all right i wonder if this isn't gonna
166:23 - work because
166:25 - we have a different key we're not using
166:27 - that key
166:29 - we'll see
166:34 - um
166:36 - release notes this is
166:44 - initial release
167:22 - okay view warning message
167:35 - all right so we could use the android
167:38 - app bundle
167:43 - all right let's see
167:47 - which i thought we were we did read
167:49 - about that
167:51 - and
167:54 - i thought we were going to try to do
167:55 - that
168:28 - all right let's let's try this then
168:32 - maybe we didn't build the right one
168:45 - i think we need to start uh let's see
168:52 - whoops
168:53 - oh i forget
169:32 - all right cool
169:33 - let that run for a minute while we
169:36 - take care of some of the other stuff we
169:37 - need to
169:42 - there we go
169:44 - all right
169:45 - so let's get
169:46 - back to that let's see if we could do
169:47 - this yep cool
170:00 - okay
170:01 - app category
170:09 - no no no
170:11 - no
170:12 - no
170:14 - no
170:18 - no
170:31 - cool
170:34 - cool looks like a good rating
170:38 - nice
170:45 - all right let's get that one done
170:47 - have content
170:56 - well let me start that
171:06 - okay
171:07 - about this one
171:10 - it's free
171:11 - and
171:19 - no ads
171:44 - integrate my services with app actions
171:48 - i don't really know what that is
171:51 - do not prove my application
172:02 - all right that looks good
172:11 - okay
172:16 - all right cool eventually i do want to
172:18 - use this with android auto but
172:20 - it's not ready for that yet
172:27 - all right cool that saves let's go back
172:30 - to this cool
172:31 - target audience
172:33 - uh i guess it's not what are your target
172:36 - age groups 18 and older
172:39 - i mean
172:41 - let's just do 18 and older how about
172:43 - that
172:45 - no
172:50 - there we go all right cool
172:54 - and we got the release and
172:57 - expo
173:05 - whoa
173:20 - all right
173:22 - all right cool so looks like we got
173:24 - everything we need right now
173:26 - um this
173:28 - except this build
173:29 - this
173:30 - newer build
173:32 - um
173:35 - where's what part is it at running
173:36 - gradle
173:38 - all right so got through a bunch of
173:40 - steps
173:47 - so basically we got a
173:49 - warning
173:50 - on our
173:55 - on our release
173:59 - um
174:01 - saying that we could have done it
174:02 - basically better if we used a different
174:07 - a different apk so i thought like hey
174:09 - maybe we just
174:11 - do this but
174:13 - it's still building
174:15 - so
174:17 - i guess if the build doesn't succeed
174:21 - very soon i'm just gonna
174:23 - do this just to kind of try it out for
174:26 - our first try and i could always try to
174:28 - upload the other build later on
174:39 - so i think that's probably
174:43 - demetrius says going straight to
174:44 - production not the best idea
174:46 - yeah i wasn't really sure what the uh
174:51 - if i should try production first or not
174:53 - like
174:56 - the app is just uh
175:00 - very basic
175:04 - and there's not going to be a big
175:05 - audience because you need the nerosity
175:07 - device
175:08 - to use it
175:12 - i thought about doing a beta
175:16 - what do y'all think let's let's uh
175:18 - decide here so
175:19 - who thinks we should go straight to
175:21 - production or should we go to beta or
175:24 - even alpha
175:26 - um
175:28 - so basically the options are should we
175:30 - go to
175:30 - should we do beta
175:33 - okay so beta track is public i kind of
175:35 - do want it to be public for everybody
175:36 - that has a nerosity notion device to try
175:39 - it so the options are either
175:41 - beta or production at this point
175:47 - so let me know what you think
175:56 - and i'll check this
176:00 - this is still
176:01 - still working
176:06 - oh okay we've got some
176:11 - all right it's actually pretty close in
176:13 - terms of votes here uh between beta and
176:17 - production it looks like
176:20 - one for
176:23 - one for beta i'm assuming dimitri is
176:26 - leaning towards beta since he's the one
176:27 - that said production isn't a good idea
176:30 - so
176:32 - beta has one two three four votes
176:35 - production all right production only has
176:37 - two so um
176:39 - let's give it
176:43 - just another like few seconds
176:47 - we have a vote for gamma all right
176:50 - again
176:52 - uh harris says for this kind of app i
176:54 - would pick production nothing to risk at
176:56 - all
176:57 - i mean yeah that's i mean i kind of
176:58 - thought like
177:00 - nothing risk how about
177:05 - okay productions making a comeback now i
177:07 - think we're about
177:08 - about even
177:12 - i just wonder what let me
177:14 - i want to
177:16 - see what the difference would be
177:18 - because
177:19 - it seems to me that
177:25 - if everybody if it's still like
177:27 - available
177:31 - then
177:33 - i guess beta would be fine because i
177:34 - would like let the users know to like
177:36 - hey this is
177:38 - the very first like
177:41 - um
177:42 - oh dimitri says one difference between
177:44 - production and beta is an app store
177:45 - there's a text beta in the title
177:48 - yeah i
177:49 - i could see like
177:52 - it's true i don't want people to think
177:53 - this is a completely finished app so
177:55 - maybe beta is the right way to go
177:57 - because there are definitely more
177:58 - features i want to add we didn't really
178:00 - try to make it look amazing
178:02 - um yeah i think
178:08 - i think we can try beta so we definitely
178:09 - want to do open beta maximum number of
178:12 - testers
178:14 - if you set the maximum it needs to be at
178:16 - least a thousand uh
178:20 - all right that's i don't really care how
178:21 - many people use this i don't know how
178:23 - many i'll just put that in
178:25 - uh feedback
178:27 - i guess
178:48 - all right and let's edit release
178:53 - all right so that's enabled
178:56 - let's
178:58 - and
179:11 - i guess one
179:21 - all right so initial release one and
179:23 - then
179:25 - all right so that's still not hey it
179:27 - finished all right cool
179:29 - let's try this one then
179:50 - all right so we're going to try to
179:50 - upload the new one we'll see if this
179:53 - this goes well now technically we didn't
179:56 - test this one
179:57 - so
179:59 - this is definitely the beta
180:01 - all right
180:02 - yeah this is it
180:05 - and this is an aab not an apk so it's
180:08 - the
180:09 - i guess the newer
180:11 - version that's recommended
180:15 - so it's uploading pretty quickly
180:17 - should be ready soon it looks like we
180:19 - completed all the other steps
180:22 - so this might be the last step
180:27 - and this has been quite a long stream
180:29 - how long have we been going for
180:34 - i don't even know what's the time
180:53 - three hours
180:54 - yeah that sounds about right we started
180:56 - at noon yeah a three hour stream
180:59 - crazy
181:00 - i'm like super hungry and actually i was
181:03 - supposed to
181:07 - there's a like an online meetup for this
181:10 - neurocity notion device that
181:13 - i can't remember if it started at two or
181:15 - three
181:15 - either way i think i'm late for it at
181:17 - this point all right it starts at three
181:19 - so
181:20 - i'll be i'll be fashionably late
181:24 - processing
181:32 - uh-oh
181:34 - you need to use a different version code
181:36 - for your apk or your bundle because you
181:37 - already have a version of this code one
181:39 - oops
181:42 - um
181:47 - oh no wait a second different version
181:49 - code
181:51 - is that gonna does that mean
181:54 - if that means i have to rebuild it then
181:56 - i'm definitely not doing that
182:02 - uh where's the
182:03 - code at
182:05 - app json i'm afraid
182:08 - yeah version i i think we had to bump
182:10 - the version so i'm just gonna go back to
182:12 - the old the other one or i could remove
182:14 - it
182:17 - i say at this point i just used the
182:20 - one that we already uploaded that worked
182:24 - with the apk version code one
182:30 - and then because i don't want to go
182:31 - through rebuilding again that took like
182:33 - seven minutes to build that's i don't
182:36 - wait another seven minutes all right
182:38 - we'll try that one
182:42 - all right
182:50 - there we go
182:52 - and review
182:57 - [Music]
183:03 - all right which
183:05 - we know that that was the case so
183:15 - oh cool i can
183:19 - full roll out seconds ago
183:32 - okay dimitri says it's practically
183:34 - impossible to change the key with which
183:35 - you sign your app so be careful not to
183:37 - leak or lose it all right good um
183:42 - good tip thank you for that
183:46 - so do i need to create the release now
183:47 - or what
183:49 - set the next step
183:56 - all right we did that
184:03 - next steps
184:10 - publish your app
184:18 - i guess we do a release now
184:24 - no we just did one
184:26 - so did it did it actually release
184:30 - yeah i'm assuming that like release
184:33 - means it's it still needs to be reviewed
184:35 - and it's not actually available
184:45 - no production releases i understand that
184:52 - okay so we have beta
185:03 - cool
185:05 - so it's pending
185:07 - so they're reviewing the app so
185:08 - basically at this point i think
185:10 - everything we can do has been done
185:12 - uh the app review has to happen before
185:15 - it gets
185:17 - it gets launched so
185:19 - um this could take a while
185:23 - so i think
185:25 - there's other stuff that i want to do
185:27 - for the app
185:28 - i don't know if we'll hold off on that
185:30 - until
185:31 - we get here back from the release or
185:33 - we'll just keep working on it i'll i'll
185:36 - figure it out uh but
185:39 - yeah at this point i'd say we're gonna
185:42 - just gonna finish up the stream so um
185:45 - yeah thank you so much
185:47 - for watching i'm gonna look i've been
185:49 - keeping up with the chat pretty well so
185:51 - i don't know that there's there's too
185:53 - much left in here that i haven't
185:54 - addressed
185:56 - and
185:58 - [Music]
186:01 - just just double checking now
186:05 - also a few years saying that when uh my
186:08 - daughter was down there saying she's
186:10 - adorable a cute child thank you
186:12 - i appreciate it
186:18 - all right cool so
186:20 - um
186:23 - [Music]
186:25 - yeah i'm gonna finish up
186:27 - and thank you all so much for watching
186:29 - i'm gonna try to do another stream in
186:31 - two days
186:32 - so let's say saturday so probably like
186:34 - monday
186:35 - afternoon eastern time
186:37 - will probably be my next stream
186:39 - and
186:41 - i'm not sure what we'll what we'll do in
186:42 - the stream we'll work on it
186:45 - and um
186:48 - yeah oh
186:50 - i'll post it in
186:53 - in twitter so
186:54 - before i stream i always post in twitter
186:58 - in linkedin and on instagram that i'm
187:01 - going to stream i believe it also
187:03 - automatically posts to facebook as well
187:06 - and then if you turn on notifications
187:08 - for free code camp then you'll get
187:10 - notifications as well i do put out
187:12 - videos on my channel so if you would
187:14 - like to get notified about those as well
187:18 - you can check the link in the
187:19 - description
187:20 - and sign up for notifications for my
187:22 - channel too those are the best ways to
187:24 - find out when i'm
187:26 - when i'm going to be streaming or when
187:27 - i'm going to release new videos i'm
187:29 - going to have a new video coming out on
187:31 - my channel tomorrow i still have to
187:33 - create that video and i'm not 100 sure
187:35 - what it's going to be about
187:37 - but i have a list of topics
187:39 - and i'm going to pick one and make a
187:41 - video tonight and release it tomorrow
187:43 - i'm going to try for tomorrow morning as
187:45 - a release eastern time
187:48 - so
187:50 - i will uh hopefully be back then uh in
187:53 - the meantime have a great west rest of
187:55 - your weekend and be safe thanks

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's jesse welcome to live coding with jesse and we have a lot to do today i want to get this app submitted to the app store today and i'd love to do it while i'm on the stream uh so i think let's see so if y'all can hear me put something in the chat the um live stream is analytics look a little bit weird uh but let me know uh otherwise i'm gonna get started i see there's a lot of people in the chat saying hello so hey everybody just a quick um a quick intro we've been working on this app for this is the fifth live stream all right cool looks like you can hear me for some reason my um video preview in the um like the stream settings panel is saying the video is private uh which is really odd since obviously you all are in the chat but i've never had it show that before all right so we've been working on this app for five live streams now and um we are using we're connecting a react native app that's built with expo with a brain computer interface called the notion by a startup company called neurocity and we've successfully connected it so that it measures we wear this device it measures our level of focus and when we drop below a certain level the screen changes to red and it makes the device vibrate so just really kind of like bare uh essential functionality and now i want to actually put it out there so we can test it on devices so we got a lot to do before we can put it out there and i've been going over some of the documentation just so that i have some idea of this process this is my very first time actually publishing so i've i've made a few apps that that definitely work and i can run on devices but i've never actually gone through the step of putting it out to the app store and there's a few extra things you need to do to get your app from working to publishable so that's what we're going to do today i'm going to set a a timer and here on one of my other screens and when that timer goes off so it's going to be 25 minutes when that timer goes off i'm going to go over to the live chat i'm going to answer some questions so there's a lot of you in the chat i see you and i'm not going to ignore you forever i'm just going to focus on doing the work for about 25 minutes and then i'm going to go to the chat answer as many questions as i can so feel free to ask as many questions as you want in the chat i will get to them and you know keep it keep it positive and try to keep the spam down uh the last couple of streams it's been a little bit weird we've had a lot of uh people spamming the chat and by that i mean they're just they keep saying the same things over and over again or just typing in a bunch of nonsense over and over again it makes it really hard to read the chat for everybody watching so try to keep that to a minimum uh if i see that you're doing that then i will um stop you from being in the chat so uh i really i won't even mention anything like i'm just gonna stop you from being in the chat so um there's not gonna really be a warning i don't have time for that especially if we get a lot of people in the stream like we have right now so um if it gets too bad i might have a moderator but really it's never been a problem before i mean we've done like literally hundreds of streams and it's only been the last few streams it's been a problem so obviously any type of like bad language or you know saying mean things to each other stuff like that you're gonna be out of the chat so let's keep it all positive okay all right so let's get started if you want to try to follow along this project is on github i believe i put a link in the description to the the code on github so you can check out the code i'm also going to be on the on expo so their documentation let me put the link to the docs that i'm using in the chat so i got a lot of these windows open for things that we need to do and so i'm going to be jumping around a little bit but this is where i started at the link i just put in the chat so this started this is where i started we're going to start from here so we're starting with um deploying the app right so from deploying the app i believe i went to distributing or deploying yeah this is the distributing so we need to create native builds so to build the app i told you there's gonna be a lot of jumping around here the docs for expo are actually really good but it's there's a lot of steps here so we we've i believe we do have the expo cli installed um already which actually i can let me double check that now make sure i have it installed i know i have installed one of my machines i actually might not have it on this one so we might need to do that whoops let's make some space here because we're going to be in the in the terminal a bit more than normal so i want to see all right it looks like yeah we have this installed otherwise we wouldn't be getting all of this stuff so yeah i believe we have this expo now it says for windows users we need to have um wsl enabled so we need to do that so this step if you're on a mac or if you're on linux you probably won't need to do this step if you're on windows you need to do this step so let's do this um so i have the documentation open already for this we need to install the windows uh subsystem uh for linux so i'll make this a bit bigger i've never done this before let's see let's see if it works so we need to copy this and run it in powershell as an admin so let's try to open windows powershell and let's see if we can run as administrator yes all right so we're running powershell as an admin let's see if i can make it bigger all right i don't know how to make it make the text bigger but i'm just copying and pasting what i just got out of this window on the right hand side and enable windows optional feature cool all right so it looks like it's doing something here let's see do you want to restart the computer to complete operation now oh no i gotta restart i was afraid this was gonna happen ah it does it says restart right there i didn't i was reading through all these documents as fast as i could right before this and i didn't see a restart all right it looks like we're going to have to restart so here's what i'm going to do i'm going to restart which basically the stream is just going to freeze up for like a second the restarts on this machine because it's pretty new are actually very quick so um let's just get it over with now um let's restart i should be back hang in there for maybe like i don't know two minutes at the most and um and we'll do this restart all right cool can you all hear me now am i back it looks like i'm back so uh i'm gonna keep going all right sweet back up yeah actually the the thing that took me the longest that was a really quick restart was that it restarted me and um by default my youtube account is set to my personal account so it tried to log me back into the free code camp um control panel but it wouldn't let me in because i wasn't free code camp so um i switched to my phone for a second just to give you all an update but anyway it's working now so let me turn the stream off on my phone and let's bring to get rid of my vpn and bring up my code sweet actually honestly like uh if you get a good windows system uh restarts are really fast it used to be windows for like super hard to restart sweet um looks like there's a vs code extension for the windows linux subsystem so i'm just going to install it because it seems like cool i'll read about more about that later on um but i guess it's good to have semantic highlighting has been applied sweets all right so now that we have that we can continue on we need to install a linux distribution i think i'm gonna go with uh ubuntu because that's what i'm used to using uh out of out of any linux distro um i don't really know if anybody has any suggestions as to whether to install ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 let me know in the chat i've used 16 more often um but i don't really know what the difference is in upgrading to 18 so i'm gonna have to make a decision here in like three minutes so just let me know let's go 16 or 18. all right so looks like we got one vote for 18. i'll go with 18. i mean honestly it's obviously the the new the newer version so may as well go with the newer version i'm open this in a new window so i can keep the documentation open and uh let's read the next it looks like we open it up we just get it it installs it and then we initialize which i already have those that documentation open as well so we'll do the initialization it looks like everybody's saying 18. cool gam002 says do debian it's the most stable if i had more time to research maybe i'd think about debian but for right now like it's been a while since i used ubuntu but i'm more familiar with all the commands and stuff so i think i'm just gonna go with ubuntu not i don't really think that we're gonna have to do that much with it i think it just needs to be installed to do the rest of the steps for expo um but let's get that and get it started yeah let's open microsoft store get it install all right it's going pretty quick it doesn't seem like it'll be too too much longer so once we get this we need to initialize so let's look at these steps while we're waiting for the install and um all right so we'll launch it and i need to set up an account update and upgrade the packages hopefully this doesn't take too long and that's it all right that's that's pretty seems pretty easy um we probably can just get that started and then move on to another step and while we're waiting for that to finish this is uh really sweet um uh colors they got look at this they got the weather on here i wonder how they had that all set up anyway that's pretty cool this is kind of cool i'm actually glad i'm getting installed i'm installing this i'm going to probably play around with this after the stream um okay cool so almost done with the uh installation looks like maybe 75 of the way down there so we'll get to that in a second i think we can get rid of this step we can get rid of this step now and what else can we get rid of yay all right so let's launch it so installing this may take a few minutes so not a problem we got other steps that we can do that don't depend on the step yet so there's a guide here to deploying to the app stores and there's a lot of stuff making sure it works on different phones i'm gonna skip over a lot of that because really this for this first mvp launch like it just needs to work on my phone all right that was really fast enter a new username alright i'm just going to enter my name and i'm going to create a password with lastpass and let's paste that in there see if it lets me paste cool what all right so i guess it's not allowing copy and paste so i'm just gonna have to type in a password all right cool sweet so we're in now we need to do our app get so we're gonna copy this we're gonna do sudo which like lets you run as an admin and then update and uh upgrade all our apps let's paste that why is it not letting me paste anything dang it all right well i'll just type it then sudo apps upgrade oops i messed it up update and upgrade all right cool that's doing its thing oh looks like uh sameep says control shift copy and paste for copy and pasting and linux terminal oh and michael says to all right sweet thank you for that i will definitely be using that in the future all right so we just need to wait for that and one of the next steps we need to have is an app icon and a splash screen so i'm going to go with the um it says we need to provide something that's at least 512 by 512 pixels um but we need uh 1024 by 1024 for ios so eventually we're going to be on ios so i think we're just going to go with 1024x1024 i do you want to continue yes let's continue so i have a free um image editing software called uh so gimp i'm just gonna use that let's see i think i already started a didn't save i started like right before the stream a template but we can just create it again so i'm just going to create one that's the dimensions we want 10 24 by 1024 so now we have this we have our background and uh let's let's just make a solid color background i don't know what color to do uh let's just got it there we go there's our our paint bucket uh color fill there's a pattern fill well what patterns can we do background background color fill fill whole selection all right what colors right now we have black and red or black and white let's change it to something else um how about just this blue color let's use blue i think our buttons blue in our app so that's like the only color we're using other than like the the red color so let's do that oops why is that not filling um there we go all right so we got our color here let's make a new layer a new layer and let's call this layer text and inside our text layer let's add a text box and i'm just going to type in our text box um s f and the color we're gonna we're gonna make the color white so we can actually see it and let's make the text like i don't know like 100 pixels and let's use um there we go let's use this font i don't know why i can't see it oops because the color got changed there we go you can tell i'm not like i'm not at all very skilled at this kind of work so my icon is just going to be letters and we're just gonna make big letters on a background because i i'm not skilled at anything artistic so eventually it'd be cool to like get a real icon but for right now i just need to get something done actually let me let me check back in on this linux thing cool looks like everything ran all right so i think we're we're good and we're good with linux i'm gonna leave it open just in case there's another step that i forgot about but i think we're good and everything's fine for that step of getting the linux distro running uh so let's see that looks like pretty much in the center i'm not too worried about it so we can export this as so we can do is first first thing we can do is save and let's save this as just sf.xcf so that way we can come in and edit it if we need to and then we're going to export it as a ping so sf.png okay so we have that exported now actually let me check all right i think my 25 minutes is up the timer got reset when i restarted so let me um let me go back to the chat right now for about five minutes i'm gonna go back to the chat i'm gonna answer some questions when we come back we're gonna take this same design here and just change the dimensions and we're gonna make a splash screen and then we should have everything we need to go forward with doing our first like build maybe we might use the android simulator in android studio to do one test run before we actually deploy it but we're getting close to being able to deploy this all right so let's see the chat um there's a lot of people saying hello so hello everybody someone says stay home stay safe corona fact yeah for sure let's see um someone's asking will i learn web development and this i assume they're asking like in this live stream will you learn web development um this one probably not because we're doing a lot of like setup work there's not really a lot of code going on in this stream but in the previous streams we do a lot more code so you might learn a little bit more uh from that uh let's see uh i'm a full stack mern web developer um so that's uh what express react and nginx is that marin i think that's fine um i need or is it not nginx is it node i can't believe i can't remember what mern stacks stands for um is the end in mern node or nginx let me know in the chat because i can't remember uh i need a project please help me actually i worked on upwork but i don't get any job last month uh and then there's your skype so yeah if anybody needs a merge stack developer for a project uh check out the chat at the beginning of the stream for um uh new ruzo has their their skype info in there yeah actually a lot of people are getting laid off um at least in the united states a lot of people are getting fired because of the coronavirus so um that's rough like hang in there everybody um i know that's tough my wife lost their job on on monday uh so i definitely understand um things are rough so if you can help each other out if if you didn't lose your job like you know try to help help out where you can all right someone asked what coding language this is uh the app is built with javascript so with uh react native all right somebody's spam in the chat see let's uh we're gonna hide that so let's see amir asks if there's a playlist of this you know what now that we have uh you know we're up to five streams now uh i think i will make a playlist of this so that'll be coming i'll try to make a playlist at some point today for it someone asks what this app will be able to do um this app will be able to track the level of focus that you currently have on whatever you're doing and then warn you when your level of focus is dropping uh charbelle says what are you using for rendering react native um i'm not i'm not exactly sure what you mean by rendering react native but uh we use um expo uh so that's i don't know if that's exactly what you mean but that let me know if that answers your question uh benson asks if it's morning or night uh it's 12 30 p.m where i'm at right now uh bloody creature says uh don't waste your time selftaught programming takes too long um well it does take a while but uh i don't think it's a waste of time like to be honest with you um teaching myself to program was a huge thing like in terms of being able to provide for my family like if you take like the job i had before i started to teach myself programming and the job i have now i make about five times as much money per year now as i did before and that was just from selftaught programming so it took me a while took me a couple years i didn't get there overnight i had jobs in between um but you know it's it definitely is better like you know i didn't have to spend any money on going to university uh or all that time i was able to make money the whole time so uh i don't think selftaught programming it takes too long or is a waste of time is actually a really good way for me to keep working and keep learning and keep paying the bills and providing for my family without having to go into debt from student loans and stuff and now like uh i'm i'm very lucky i'm i'm able to make more money you know from my family than i ever thought i would be able to so yeah it worked out for me let's see a lot of people are asking like what we're doing for this app so i explained that a couple times already so um i guess if if you're just joining and you didn't hear the explanations you can always rewind it like before beforehand in the uh stream to hear the explanation and then come back to the like what we're doing now um if you're joining a little bit late and want to catch up you can always like rewind the stream to the beginning and then play it on double speed and then you'll you'll get everything that happened and you'll catch up with us uh on the live so i recommend doing that if if you join like in the middle and you're totally lost that's a good option let's see blazing up says never even heard of react native before is it good um i i think it's good i think if you already know javascript uh then it's a really really good way to build native apps without having to learn different languages for android and ios oh no my timer quit again all right that's it i'm done with this timer this is like three streams in a row now that my timer quit working so i gotta find a new timer that one is just not working for us i thought it had been a long time here all right so i didn't get through all the questions i'm going to stop and get back to the code now uh i'll come back to the questions though all right so we've saved this as our app icon now we need to do a um let's find this we need to do a splash screen which i also have up here actually well let's let's uh upload this while we're waiting so i found this this site which is app icon generator which you upload your icon in 1024 by 1024 pixels and then it'll give you icons in different sizes and files so uh let's let's do that um we're going to name it so let's upload our file which we named what do we name it it should be right here unless it went to a different folder now the default folder to save those files is right here that's really odd let's look in our our folder system then that's weird let me export it again see where it went sf.png oh it went into documents that's weird for some reason the default folder was documents all right so we'll go to documents sf area and i want to name it the same thing that we have in our app currently just to like save time so it's icon.png generate these i'm not going to worry about the ios stuff for now we'll do um probably like a different stream at some point and do the ios build and everything uh all right so we have our icons and i want to unzip these oops i think i opened this twice yeah i did all right so what did it send me wow send a lot of different files here let's let's see what the heck it said i just want that's crazy all right well let's just extract them all for now so we can take a look at them here see what we want bring this over app icons all right so this one looks like play store that's what we really want uh so i'm just gonna grab that one i think yeah for now i'm just grabbing this one i think we just need one for now i actually think what is the difference with this yeah maybe we didn't need to do that you know what i'm not going to use those i thought we'd we'd get like different ones that would have been that would have worked but i think i'm just going to pull over uh the file that we made so in our documents and so we have this sf and i'm gonna pull that over to our assets and i'm going to delete this icon and i'm going to rename this one there we go so now that'll be our icon and we can move on to our splash screen let's see this is the icon page we could just get rid of this page we don't need that anymore uh splash screen okay add a splash screen i thought i had this open already i guess not all right 1242 by 2436. all right now this is for ios but i i read through this a little bit uh earlier i just kind of skimmed through it and i believe this will also work for android so we're gonna we're gonna try to do that as well so let's go back to our image editor there we go yep and let me i'm gonna pull this out we don't need the full screen i'm gonna shrink it up a little bit so we can see our instructions as well 12 24 okay so let's take our background and let's see if we can resize it oh i don't think i can from there let's talk about let's see if we can do it here image canvas size yeah all right cool let's change the canvas size to we want width to be 1242 pixels and we're going to be 24 36 pixels tall let's resize that and let's let's put the sf part right in the middle that looks that looks okay all right all right cool so now we have um a different size we have our background here let's see if we can fill in our background with with this color i don't know if we can um color yeah it's not gonna let us what do we need to do here let's scale layer change size resize layer to the size of image see if that'll work sweet that works alright cool all right awesome so we resized our background layer now let's export this and let's just export this i guess we could say we'll go sf splash i'm saying sf because i've i've decided to name the app stay focused i don't really know if there's another app named meta or how that works but that's just the name that i uh thought of yep export all right now let's move this over oops oh there it is let's delete our splash and change this to splash cool all right so we should have what we need and i think our app.json already is showing what we need so yeah so our splash it's already there uh background color actually so let's change our background color to match what we made the background color for our app we should be able to find that out i think from this what's the current there we go there's a hex color cool let's save that that might be the only code change that we need to do all right cool and i think we're just going to leave everything else for the splash screens as like the defaults and we're going to be done with that step and let's see actually we're done with this as well let's get rid of that deploy all right yeah a lot of this stuff i'm not going to worry about for now okay we need android permissions we might need permissions for that vibrate feature yeah let's let's check out our permissions here okay so we do have vibrate all right let's add that then whoops forget the comma android and then permissions and permissions is an array of strings vibrates okay all right so we should be good there let's get rid of that and comment at projections i'm not going to worry about the ad projections until we uh we get rejected so let's get rid of that all right let's talk about okay so way back to where we started here we're still on step one installed it uh install g expo click okay so i am using yarn let's just go ahead and be 100 sure that we have installed this and we're going to do a global install uh it's just gonna work without let's see if it works without me running this as an admin it might give us an error if i'm not an admin if it does no big deal we'll just reopen uh as an admin all right we've already i believe configured app.json well let's see for android at least looks like we're going to need to have a package name and a version code i don't think we have that yet so um let's try that let's create a package and i guess i'll just use the um your company dot your app name um i don't know what my company name is going to be just name it after myself and your app name stay focused and then version code is going to be one this version one there we go save that all right still fetching packages all right we'll give that another minute if nothing happens then maybe i'll stop it and then do it oh cool just being too impatient there looks like it's still doing its thing um see i'll do i'm going to stop maybe in like 10 minutes and get back to some questions so hang in there if you uh if you're asking some questions i will get to the chat again and and like 10 minutes so about 1 p.m eastern time i'm gonna stop and do questions i went over a little bit on the last question so sweet all right so we're definitely installed now it looks like maybe i didn't have uh this installed globally i think maybe i just had it installed uh locally like on this package so good thing we went through that so that should work and name icon and version are required slug is the url name that you ask javascript is pub just publish to let's see if we have slug right stay focused just double checking to make sure we have what we need it looks good i'm not worried about ios for right now uh sdk version do we have that yeah we do okay let's take out ios from our platforms for right now since we're not targeting ios at the moment we'll just do android and web alright we can start the android build uh okay all right this is interesting let's let's take the time to fig to understand this here uh because we are building for android so we can do a build apk or an android app bundle app bundles are recommended but you have to make sure the google play app signing is enabled for your project you can read more about it here okay it looks like we'll need a key store um that they will generate for us which is sweet because i don't know what that is if you let expo generate a key store for you we strongly recommend that you later fetch the key store and back up your key store all right we'll do that and we'll i'll save it in lastpass we'll need that to update the app all right cool let's just get down wait for it to finish building okay so we can call a web hook that'll let us know when the build is done i'm not going to worry about that and we can test it we'll definitely want to test it and then we'll submit it okay so here's what we're going to do first we're going to test uh we're going to test it before we go through the build because the build seems like it may take a little bit but then test and then we'll run this and uh so let's let's do the test and this is going to be actually let's do let's commit the the changes we made we need to get add git commit we have this message uh and um add icons and update app.json we're gonna push that to github so that's push and now let's run yarn start and let's try to run this on the android emulator all right looks like i'll have to start it first so let's do android android studio this would be a nice test of the power of this computer to see if we can run all this um we need to do abd manager and i already set up a uh a test pixel device so let's start that up hey it was already running the previous version before we did all the uh all the updates here all right so now that that's running we should be able to run this again i'm just pressing the a button as a shortcut to start this up i could come over here and press the emulator button all right so now we should get a connection here at some point it's possible that we might need to refresh the app which we can do let's do a refresh now there we go all right so now it's going to load the new stuff sweet um so now we have the new stuff here uh we can try to link let's try to link our device and actually log in once and see if that just to run through make sure we don't get any crazy errors or anything right so i need to go on my other screen here and grab some of my info so i'm going to grab device id and password oops no let me paste it's not letting me paste no there's gotta be there's gotta be a uh setting on here to let me paste stuff in here um there's some is there a keyboard option no all right there we go well at least i found the found the dark theme uh if i have to actually type out this is gonna it's gonna take five minutes to type everything out that's crazy you know what actually there we go there's the paste all right if i hold in for a second it just hit me like oh maybe i have to pace like i do normally on an android device and that's you just hold in the the button like you're tapping like a long tap and then you get paste so crisis averted i just should like not make my password 70 characters long and then maybe i'd be all right i just listened to too many hacker podcasts and now it's made me paranoid about making my passwords very long but i figure like if we're dealing with data from my own brain i should have long passwords right sweet all right let's see so setting a timer for a long period of time multiple minutes is performance correctness issue on android let's read this what it's saying as it keeps the timer module awake and timers can only be called when the app is in the foreground okay that's fine so set timeout do we have a set timeout in our app oops i don't need that all right so we don't actually have a set timeout in our code so i'm guessing that's in maybe one of the packages we're using so can't really do anything about that so i'm gonna i'm gonna dismiss that all right cool so this looks good we're logged in um i don't actually have the headset on so let me let me turn the headset on just so that we can verify like with with data if if we're gonna get um like if it will work with the data once we do that we can actually do the build another way i could test this is i could link i could hook up my android phone by a usb cable to my computer and we could test like that but if i did that you all wouldn't be able to see it so that's why i'm not testing that way we did that a couple of streams ago and it it did work with the previous version of the app none of the logic has really changed too much so i think it's it's fine it'll still work uh what i don't think we can test is the vibration feature so i don't know if we're going to see anything at all when the app is supposed to vibrate um but the uh this notion device is starting this is the brain computer interface i'll put this on in a second and we should see some real data from this as soon as the operating system on this is started then we'll we'll go forward with it while i'm waiting for that which should only be a few more seconds i'll check the chat all right um i got some questions about what am i building it's a brain computer app that checks your level of focus if you want to know more about it you can check out previous streams or go to like the beginning of this stream and you should be able to get a better explanation while i'm waiting for the device to start too i want to remind everybody that if you're interested in this particular device the the notion from neurocity you can check out my youtube channel the links in the description i did a more indepth review of this device and showed off some of the stuff that it can do so check that out i also do some coding tutorials i just did one on typescript like an intro to typescript i did a video on uh javascript documentation cool it's online so let me put this on so if if you at all like what i'm doing here please check out my my channel as well and i'm trying to do since everybody's in quarantine i'd like to do some type of content probably like a live stream or a video every day i'm going to try to alternate between live streams on free code camp and a video on my own channel so hopefully it's it's helpful to some people especially if you're quarantined by yourself i'm hoping that maybe this is like you know a little bit of interaction with with other developers you know with me and with the people in the live stream um i know it's it's probably tough uh tough for a lot of people right now so i'm not a doctor i'm not a mental health expert uh but i do know how to code so i'm i'm gonna do that all right this looks like it's working so as i suspected we're not really getting the vibration because it's a simulator so but since i successfully tested the vibration before on on a real device then i'm just going to assume that it works so cool that works all right i'm going to test logging out now oh okay you know what when we log out nothing happens on the screen that's interesting i think maybe we should have something happen on the screen otherwise users would have to like close the app something needs to happen let's fix that before we before we do anything else because i think that's that's a big deal i'm going to take this off just for now so i can put my headphones back up um yeah i think that that's actually a pr that would be a pretty annoying thing if the user had to you know like constantly restart every time they want they logged out so uh let's let's fix that now and let's see how we can do that so when we log out what would change so let's see right now the um the login page is shown if we don't have a user so what is logout do so notion log out let's find our logout function oh we just directly call notion.logout let's see what we could do i think if if we create a function that's a log out function and we add notion.log out then we can also manually clear the user and that should that should fix it so let's add a logout function i'm going to do a log out and it's going to take no parameters and we're going to do a notion.log out and we're also going to set user back to let me see what we have we're going to set it back to null oops set user no okay let's save that and see like a lot of stuff is happening here we should be able to see oops permission denied for what let's dismiss all that let's do a refresh it looks like all right let me uh copy my password again okay now when we log out this time it should go back to our other screen okay cool it did oh no but we're automatically getting logged in and we're getting we're getting a warning okay let's i think warnings are okay uh and it won't like crash our app so i'm okay with that for right now if we get any any red colored notifications that are errors then i'll be more worried but i do want to see um so we we had the issue of the auto logging in happening and i want to want to make sure that we're not doing that anymore so we had that happening because of uh i believe it was notion login was it this one was automatically logging in i think it was all right let's see um let's see if this will work i'm i'm thinking that if we take out user and set user as things that we need to track in here that that might solve our our issue because this won't reset let's see all right cool so it didn't log us in let's submit this and let's log out cool all right so now everything was still saved which is actually pretty useful um and it's not it's not doing that so let's try to let's manually refresh just to verify all right and the thing is it's making us log in again we did want to avoid that we wanted to avoid having to log in again so i thought we had it we did have it set up so that if we had the device id we would get a new notion and we would set notion which that's actually kind of weird that our auto login is not working let's test this let's run on a web browser too because we had it working on a web browser can't be reached why not okay looks like it's got to build i wonder if i can run it on web and android at the same time all right so this is automatically linking it has it okay all right all right there is some weirdness going on with um automatically starting but at least like it does seem to be saving so it's it's saving the id which i'm okay with that if the user happens to have a password manager they can save their password so i'm okay with that for now all right oops i went over time i'm gonna go back to the chat now i apologize i totally lost track of time i shoulda i should have checked the chat like 10 minutes ago uh so let me go to the chat now and um take about five minutes here in the chat um hey david uh corbin's here he says hey jesse keep up the great work thanks man good to see you in here i work with david he is like a uh a kubernetes expert um moshiko says how do you manage to stay focused over time um i don't know uh i guess uh when i really need to stay focused like i'm gonna be honest i take um i take like a supplement called g fuel that's a bunch of b vitamins and like other vitamins and caffeine and it does help me stay focused so that's that's what i do when i really need to focus um other than that i i don't know i just like take breaks when i need to um yeah uh boym lol says how many years of experience do you have um i don't know it's been a lot it's been a long time it's been a long time maybe seven i'm trying to think back to when i started um from the time when like i actually started getting paid to do coding like consistently i'm gonna say like somewhere around sevenish years uh as she says uh it's my first live session on free code camp oh congratulations welcome thanks for watching uh gamm002 says how many hours of coding experience would you have approximately oh i i have no idea i'd have to do some serious math and an estimation work on that one i don't know i mean i guess like so if i've been coding for about seven years full time then i mean you figure i wouldn't say that i would have like 40 hours a week of coding because so much time is spent in meetings and things like that like let's just be like very conservative in our estimate and say estimate 20 hours a week coding let's factor in vacations and sick days let's say like 20 hours per week coding and 50 weeks a year for seven years so uh let me get my calculator out because i don't want to make simple math mistakes live on youtube right so let's do this 20 times 50 times seven uh all right we're going to say 7000 coding hours so uh i guess that's a lot of hours right and i mean that's definitely a really big estimation right because there were probably some weeks when i did less than that and some weeks when i did more than that but that's my best estimate of of coding which i probably have done more than that because 20 hours a week is not really that much and there's been times when i've been working fulltime coding and then also have an extra parttime project on the side but that's that's a decent estimate i'd say i have at least seven 000 coding hours at this point bart says hey from france hey how's it going uh i ir a ayr how do you pronounce ayr but anyway says what resources did you use to study um free code camp so free cocaine.org has a great curriculum which is i really like it i used that i used udacity has free code or free courses a lot of youtube videos there's a youtube channel called learn code academy that i really liked um there's a youtube channel called devtips that i liked to watch um let's see codecademy uh had some great free content and then of course like documentation um stack overflow uh articles and stuff mozilla developer network so those are all like my main my main resources uh yeah let's see and then actually like building projects is a great resource let's see opinion on types so meep says what's your opinion on typescript will it replace javascript in the next five years uh i don't think it will replace javascript like yeah i i mean i don't really know the numbers i haven't looked into it that much but i doubt that it will replace javascript charbelle says make a new timer yeah i could make a new timer somebody that used to watch the streams a lot his name's harshit um he made a uh a timer for me but i forgot the url so i just need to figure out what the url of it is and um and go to that timer that one always worked really well all right i'm gonna that was about five minutes of um chat so i'm gonna go back now because we we need to build now so the um i guess i should say like keeping the user logged in is not working exactly like we had it working before but it's it's still saving the id so i'm okay with that and then like i said if the user has some sort of password manager they could save their their other credentials in here and i think that would be okay maybe we could potentially give the user an option to stay completely logged in all the time on a future update but i don't want to make that the default so i'm going to leave it off for now plus i just really want to get this bundled up into the app store like i said we are having some error messages come up i shouldn't say air we're having some warnings come up which i'm okay with for now uh as because i don't think it'll crash our app i think we'll be we'll be all right so we're not having any crashes so um i think we're good to keep on on going let's do uh we're gonna have to save the changes that we just made we're gonna do an am flag for our commit and let's do fix because this was a bug um let's see take so i'm committing this and it says it's to take user back to login screen after logging out i'm going to push that if you want to see the code that i'm pushing then check out the github repo the links in the description all right let's go to i'm gonna shut down now our our expo server and close out i have a lot of windows here that are not necessary right now so i don't need this right now we did that um i don't think we need this and bundles i don't think we need this i'll keep it i must open it for a reason so i'm going to keep it up for now now we're going to do a build so let's run the expo build for android and then it looks like we're gonna have to answer some questions for this and let it run for a little bit and while it's running i can answer some more questions so we're gonna do expo build android and i guess we'll have to make a new expo account because i don't think i ever made one just crazy that i never made one because i've been using expo for years but i'm almost positive i do not have an account so let's make a new one it's cool that i don't have one because then we get to go over the whole process live username i'll just say j weigle and password i'm gonna make a password over here with lastpass so i can have lastpass generate secure passwords jay weigle already exists interesting let's see if i have an expo account uh expo dot io see if i can log in uh forgot password email jessie gmail.com all right i'm gonna open my email on another screen here evidently i do have an expo account well maybe i do maybe somebody just used the name jygo for an account well i do have a password so i'm going to reset my password here on this other screen and i'm going to use that new password that i just made and save password and i'm adding this account to lastpass so we'll have it cool let's log into my account suite i have no builds all right cool so let's try this now and let's pick the right answer log in with existing account uh jay weigl here's the password sweet let expo handle the process definitely build ios bundle i said android set expo debug true in your dev environment to view the stack chase what happened hmm maybe i hit the wrong did i hit the wrong thing oh okay once i thought it would just automatically pick that uh answer is one gonna work no it said false why did it say false all right what am i doing wrong here everybody let's make this bigger all right so it says let's try this again expo build android just there's a new version of expo cli available like we literally just installed this globally how did we get the older version all right let's do this let's get the new version first of all well let's try to npm install it this time how about that we used yarn before maybe maybe i had installed it with npm originally and for some reason it's using that one instead of the yarn one i mean you all saw me not that long ago install this so while that's going then we will let me double check so start the build expo build android right okay um wow this is taking well we'll see let me go to the chat i'll answer some questions and then if i get through all the questions and we're still not finished with this then we'll we'll handle that if it happens um we have a question that says can can you loop through an array of audio files hello from france hey how's it going um i'm assuming you can loop through an array of anything i'm not sure like how the audio files are like the format or anything like i don't have experience with that but if you have an array like i'm assuming you can loop through it um valentino says what's a brain computer jj says what's a computer this is the brain computer it reads your brain waves and then sends them wherever you want them to go like in terms of to an app or a website or something like that you can learn more about this i did a video review on my youtube channel the links in the description for my channel so you can check out to learn more it's called the notion and it's built by a company called nerosity wizock says react native was fun but flutter was better i haven't i haven't had a chance to use flutter yet i've heard good things about it um still using react native so um yeah can't really comment too much on that but um yeah i've what do you all think about flutter i don't want to start a battle between react david and flutter because i think they're both good um but what a if if any of y'all have used it you know what do you think uh tasha says what database are you using currently i have no database set up for this particular app uh so no no database um i don't know what th the neurosc device is has like its own um operating system and server and they they might have a database running on here and i don't know what it is but um in terms of like what we built for this app i don't have anything uh for a database arif says why why am i here uh obviously because you wanted to watch some code right or it was an accident in which case welcome and feel free to ask any questions if you have them uh lrj says i am human uh excellent so am i dl td says y'all so smart wish i can catch up oh don't worry about it we're not it's this is the fifth stream that we've done so like uh if if you if anybody can like jump right in and understand what's going on at this point then you have to be like very smart and experienced at this so um feel free to ask as many questions as you can or as you want to um and you know go back and you'll watch the previous streams definitely recommend watching them at double speed that'll help you to catch up and i i think the streams are easier to watch in double speed like i i talk kind of slowly i take my time so double speed is better uh pap stew says can you suggest to me some good channels or websites for android development i don't know too much about specifically android development uh he says using java or kotlin yeah i don't know for sure so um i know the free codecamp youtube channel that i'm on right now does have some videos about different types of development so we probably have something about java and kotlin so i'd check that out other than that though i don't really know too much about resources for that let's see a few people join saying hello so hey how's it going uh xx snooki says do you have any tips for people learning c sharp uh not really what is this telling me let's i'm gonna close this since we can't connect to the server anymore so there we go there we go closing closing a few things i thought it just occurred to me that hey if i close all this other stuff maybe this will install more quickly so actually it did so let's uh let's try to run let's try to run this again see if we're on the right version now and if that makes a difference right because if if we're using the latest instructions it's possible that because i was on an old version that's why it wasn't working i i don't know it's just a thought um i want to see answer so i'm trying to go up and down to see if i can change this like up and down but that's not working so i guess let expo handle the process let's see huh why is it doing this all right we're gonna we're gonna have to go into um go into research mode here for for a minute uh so let's see and one thing i don't understand is why it keeps trying to build the ios bundle when we're trying to just do android let's see what we can get alright cool okay looks like we need to start expo so let's run expo kind of odd i would have thought we didn't want it running when we do the build but i guess that is not the case so we want to and that this makes sense right if it's trying to connect then we definitely want it running alright cool so let's try it again i still i don't like that it automatically put in false for me here because i think i need the keystore so while this is doing its thing i want to look um look this up and see if anybody else is having issues with that hmm this up already all right well i guess when this is all over we'll try to grab our key store see if it exists otherwise we have to figure something out for our key store it seems like as long as we can when we have to upload otherwise feel free to upload your own that's weird oh well all right while that's happening let's let me go back to the chat all right the last question was uh do you have any tips for people learning c sharp um i don't really know i guess um just similar tips for learning anything try to do a little bit with it every day uh just keep on like try to try to build real projects with it one future says how can i improve redux skill example or project redux is hard i'm a junior front end deaf yeah i guess um for redux try to start out with something very simple because redux is difficult so try to start out with a simple project once you see it all working together on a project it gets a lot easier uh but you know i definitely try to find some sort of tutorial that'll give you a very simple project um you know you can check out like the redux documentation and go through that it's it redux is going to take a while for you to understand it's just kind of difficult at first so uh don't be discouraged if it's if it's taking a while like it's it is complex solo code ninja says hello brother hey how's it going xero says uh you can build ios apps on a pc no i don't think you can i think you could just build um android although expo might let you build like maybe expo like build it on their servers i'm not really sure how that'll work with with expo but i'm um i'm worried about building the android stuff right now i assumed i would have to switch to my my mac to do the ios stuff uh zanik says uh what up can you do html please i don't do much like straight html uh on on my live streams uh mostly i'm doing react native nowadays chinmay says uh how much did it cost oh the i assume you're talking about this spring computer interface i believe it was like a thousand dollars somewhere around there um this was like one of like the first test devices i don't know what the retail price is going to be once they they actually have them available like the finished product available chinmay says flutter is amazing still growing yeah that's what i thought too like i think flutter will be a legitimate like competitor to react native or i don't want to say competitor because that's like the wrong way to look at it i think it'll be a more legitimate option once the community grows right one thing i think react native has that flutter doesn't yet just because it's a lot older is a much bigger ecosystem more packages available and flutter will flutter will get there right as long as it keeps getting growing and more people using it it'll get there it's just it takes time so i think right now the flutter ecosystem is just it's just not quite as big right and i mean that comes with there's good and bad about that like if you want to get in and really have an impact on an ecosystem it's way easier to get in on an early ecosystem like flutter than it is on something like react native but if you just want to get in and build stuff the odds of you finding readymade a you know examples and libraries to do what you want to do on a younger project are lower than on an older project so it just it really depends on what you want to do chinmace is waiting for webrtc on flutter good so like that's a good example it's just depending on what you want to do it may not be available for a younger project it's not to say it's a bad project it's just it's going to take time for people to start developing all the things that they need let's see let's see mr now now i'm not sure to pronounce your name apologies for that says uh what about algo should i have to learn it before studying programming you mean like algorithms no you definitely don't need to learn that before you start programming um you can start building stuff without that cmo says how to learn spring boots i don't know because i don't really know it a lot of people that i work with use it but i i don't know very much about it at all if anybody else knows more about it please let us know in the chat um mag mala says bruh i just learned drop down menus on html this is definitely out of my range oh well feel free to ask questions and watch if you want to i understand if it's if it's a little out of your range but uh congrats on learning drop down menus and uh that's that's definitely a good skill to have when building websites um but yeah i i really hope that these streams will be good for people at any skill level because i i do my best to explain what's happening and i do take any questions so uh i guess you don't don't try not to feel intimidated if you're just starting out and i'm happy to explain what's going on uh vivec says will you do any machine learning projects on the live stream i might i might we'll just see you know how this goes i think the data from the brain computer interface you could do some really cool machine learning stuff with that so i'm thinking like that's a possibility at some point and there's some other things that i think could be cool with machine learning that i'd like to do so i don't have any plans to do it in the immediate future but you know it is on my mind for some some projects that i've thought of uh brian says love from kenya love coding oh awesome thank you uh adrian says what react redux package is the best easy peasy um i'm not sure what you mean by react redux package if i i guess if i were to start out i would use create react app to uh to get started i believe there's now a react redux starter with create react app where it'll it'll scaffold out a react app with redux already kind of connected i haven't used it yet i just read about it so if i remember correctly i think that that is out there now that would probably be the best way to get started with reactant redux okay i can monitor the progress of the build at the url which i think i already have that open though right sweet build details building creating key store keystore created successfully key source and sources oh cool so evidently we did get the keystore created somehow although it was not obvious from here so let's let's check out some of the info we're getting from this so we're not really getting great info in the console which is cool they got this this thing here so um let's see so we got the keystore starting the build process icon setup native modules whoa whoa build is finished sweet nice build successful so cool all right let's download it get the apk very nice and it's uploaded now to s3 very cool all right so let's let's go to the next step here um all right so we've built it's finished building let's test it to run it on your android device make sure you have android platform tools installed along with adb and then just run adb install with usb debugging all right i'm gonna plug my device in and then i'm gonna try to install this that we've just made on my android device and uh let's see i need to need to plug it in in the back of my computer so i i forgot to bring i was going to switch this up and have a usbc cable but i forgot to bring it so now i need to find my other cable that is usb on one end and usbc on the other end all right found it i need to unplug something that is in hopefully y'all heard what i was saying i was in front of the mic but okay all right plugging that in and and i do have a robe on it's cold in my basement so it's not it's not that professional but this is how i i like the streams to be authentic and this is how i often code so it is authentic all right so i have that plugged in now i need to run the adb install sweet so let me move let me get rid of that let's turn that off and i'm just going to go out downloads and let's see what we called it stay focused with all kinds of stuff so let's see adb install and then the file name so let's let's do that i'm pretty sure i had adb working adb huh i thought i ran an adb command not that long ago all right let's see how do i get adb to install the android platform tools let me open up my android studio tools all right let me let me do a little search here what was it called android platform tools she get the latest sdk platform tools for interest us sdk manager all right so android studio has an sdk manager let's see if we can and from the sdk manager we can get to tools see how this goes i should have gotten these when i downloaded i downloaded this so let me see if anybody oh barratt says maybe you installed adb for windows system but not for ubuntu yeah that's possible let's see oh sdk tools android sdk command line tools it said not installed so let's let's try to download this cool that's kind of odd i would think something like that like should have been the default but i guess not all right cool that was fast all right now let's see i might have to restart the terminal yeah or just start a new one let's see if i got see adb hmm try i doubt it would work in my linux subsystem hmm oops that was accident um maybe i'll just try to do it this way see if it works i thought i just did this oh it already exists why didn't it not write in an update that's sweet oh there we go now how do i install that uh cmo says add adb in variable environment um i wonder if i actually have access to any of the android tools that's very weird nothing man it says add to environment path let's see all right add adb all right let's see all right cool let's try this open windows explorer right click my pc properties advanced system settings environment variables we got path double click it okay browse whoops see program files adb fast oh hmm hmm i'm not seeing where to add this hmm oh man just copy the downloaded folder path and add us a new path oh that's right we did download that okay all right that'll add it to windows path oh okay i totally didn't see this first section that seems like the easier one but it looks like we don't have the exes we just have the dlls unless um oh actually fastboot adb application yeah we could copy that to c windows and it should be good to go from the command line actually let's do that let's just copy i'm going to copy those and then windows oops no no no cancel that all right so either way that should work at least for the windows part which is fine because i'll do a command prompt and let's see if we can do it now adb yes it works all right cool so we got a lot of stuff going on here okay oh goodness okay so back to where we need to go for there we go ah no i forget it's this actually let me look here cool i have adb here as well which is sweet so i'm already in the downloads here so let's just rerun this command that we just ran cool so this should perform an install on my phone success all right so how do i actually run this then hmm all right let's verify okay so i have a device oh hmm it says it's installed but i don't i didn't see anything happen on my phone interesting okay let's troubleshoot that then uh okay let's see madness says it's much easier to have a copy of the apk on your phone and then install it manually i could probably do it through uh google drive right you could upload the apk i'll do that on my other screen i'm just uploading the apk oh there we go it works it's in the process of uploading i guess i'll start it on my device in all right cool so it uploaded let's go to google drive i mean i would like to know why it's not working but you know just to get this started we can do the upload here let's see where's my google drive i'm gonna download this downloading it to my device now cool download worked all right i'm installing so we'll say as i'm installing this twice it opened just to give me like security warnings because this three times um it's it said there's security warnings here but it's opening so i don't know if you can see that it is open on my machine so um that's that's pretty cool let's uh i guess i can i'm going to try to run this on my device so i'm going to copy and paste my um my key or my like my device id into google keep so that i can easily copy and paste it into my phone and try it on my phone let's see cool google keep syncs very quickly it's really good for this kind of stuff all right i pasted that in let's put my email in and uh password i'll go into my lastpass and say nope i need um nerosity all right hopefully this is the right password nice all right cool so it's working so obviously i'm getting it's vibrating i know if you can hear that you can hear that on the mic now it's vibrating and uh i don't have the headset on so obviously like i'm not focused right and it's giving me this red this red message sweet i'm gonna log out now so it stops with all this vibrating oh no i logged out and it's still vibrating in red that's a bug but at least the vibrating only goes on for maybe like 10 seconds at the most maybe less than that uh but all right that's cool all right very cool so it works and uh i believe i have like a stay focused icon now in my phone which is really sweet see if i could find it yeah this so the little sf isn't an icon very cool all right so that works i'm going to go through the next step now of um let's get rid of this and submit it uploading apps so to upload the previously built standalone adapter apps where you simply run expo upload android uh but i thought we have to do we have to create an account download this json private key after that you have to create an app on google click console and upload your app manually at least once all right so we got to go to google play console which cool now i already signed up for an account on here so you would have to do that step let's create an app we're gonna call it stay focused short description alert you when you start to lose focus and the full description is works with the generosity motion q2 there you go current level of focus nice vibrates all right cool all right graphic assets screenshots all right we gotta add at least one phone screenshot all right well i guess i'll uh take a screenshot from my phone then and download that all right all right i guess i'll upload the screenshot to um my google drive so that i can get it back down there all right i know it's been a while since i've gotten to the chat so i'll get back to the chat in just a minute let's try to get this screenshot uploaded all right so the screenshot's being uploaded to google drive i got my drive open on my other windows so i should be able to see when it gets there yep it's there now i'm going to download that screenshot and should be able to there we go uh oh need to resize your screenshot uh okay it's too big feature graphic goodness i need all this stuff to application productivity content rating man there's a lot of stuff to do this all right well let's just keep going then all right uh hirez icon let's see if we can use that uh icon that we created dimensions required are 5 12 by 5 12. uh okay so let's take pixlr all right so if i'm just resizing stuff i like to use pixlr i can figure out how to get logon pixlr editor which one is the i don't remember this is different than what i was looking for maybe open image let's open this one image image size there we go all right hopefully that'll work so this is probably boring i didn't realize uh how much was involved and now this one needs to be minimum length 320. interesting all right at least two screenshots are required oh we need at least two huh all right well i guess i'll take another one then let me do one logged out i guess there we go um okay so let's go into the editor then and uh let's get a new image and i'm gonna upload this image so we got this screenshot uh yeah we want a new size and it needs to be what was it three minimum length for any side 320 max length for any size 3840 so what do what do we have that seems like it fit though didn't it let's try that again because um it's between 320 pixels and 3840 pixels let's try that let's try that again see what it says you need to resize your screenshot max aspect ratio two to one maybe when maybe we're not hitting the aspect ratio let's see image size um let's see if we can google play uh let's see let's see if we got something that will do it for us app screenshot builder i don't want to create an account no no all right let's see uh harish says use bulk resize photos.com okay i'll try that actually what about this one cool see this is cool now what can i do with this if this worked that's going to be that's gonna be sweet all right let's open this and extract to download screenshots okay screenshots all right let's try where are we at is that gonna work nice screenshot too oh sweet nice feature graphic what the heck is a feature graphic 10 24 by 500 um okay let's go back to this is so much more image editing than i am ever used to doing this is crazy oh way to go all right let's take our um let's take this and use the what 10 24 by 500 uh let's see if we can just take this and do i guess we'll have to do the whole canvas canvas size was this 1024 by 500. okay interesting all right let's take this text then and um there we go all right let's export as well they want this as png oops sf um well this is called feature bear with me everybody this is the first time i've ever done this and i guess this went to documents yes all right what else do we need i don't have a promo video we put that in tags all right tags no i don't want to leave this thing all right let's save draft now i would hate to actually lose anything we've done here all right so so far i think we've got everything that we need up to here i guess we don't need tags content rating what are we gonna do here you must upload an apk before taking the content rating questionnaire okay that looks good that's good then so we'll skip that for now website i don't have a website please provide an email address there we go phone number hey now you all know my phone number um privacy policy if you wish pride policy policy please send it below um i don't have one right now hopefully that won't be an issue uh where can i go where can i upload this apk did i miss it hmm let's do a beta release i'm guessing a beta release would have less restrictions i don't know let me see for production all right let me go back i'm gonna go back to the chat before i do anything else just to see if anybody has anything like to say about this particular process right here let's see oh haru says you could use a policy generator and add the google doc link oh that's a great idea let's do that oh yes i don't have a company name no gotta provide my address for my company is registered i don't have it yes wow oh my goodness so many questions what ah fine all right what can i do with this platform all right let's just put this in a google doc blank awesome that was a good idea let's let's go to the store listing and now we'll add in a privacy policy save that as a draft okay excellent now i need to i need to figure out i guess i gotta go to the app releases all right for internal testing within minutes i mean how i just wonder which one would be the best to do so did the google lock let me see let me go back to expo and see api access create a service account create new project all right let's do the api access and create a service account pretty i'm not sure if i was allowed to uh have this this looks like the public key so i guess it's fine that's in there um come here baby you want to say hello hey i'm building an app what do you think pretty cool how you doing today good good you say hi to everybody hi all right let's see daddy one of these what are these daddy what are these what are those that's a brain computer you want to wear it yeah it'll read your brain what do you think see you want to see it on the screen yeah all right look all right let's show you brainwash cool let's show this right now look this is uh cordelia my daughter is wearing the headset and this is these are her brainwaves well they were until i moved the screen let's start it again uh did something happen see if the signal quality is okay it's probably too big let me shorten it up for you baby okay there we go all right put your head put your head down there we go okay let's see if we get some better signals here your hair's a lot longer than mine too might be a problem hope it's almost out of batteries i left it on this whole time there you go we got some brainwaves oh we got a little bit got a little bit going on i don't know what the problem is how to refresh there we go that's crazy your brainwaves look pretty crazy huh what's your brain doing taking food from my belly you want to put this on crooked too i think there we go it's probably going to run out of batteries but that's kind of cool yeah i'll put this on the other screen and you can see you can keep looking at it how about that and they keep looking at your brain what it's doing making all those colors okay so anyway i followed a couple of links and got to this in terms of like the first thing so i guess there's two things to do one is create this account and then that way we don't have to keep manually uploading we can just use the expo command line to do it then we can then we can do the manual upload for the first time so let's do these steps and you know what's going to be crazy is after all of this we're still not going to have the app ready until they actually do the review so it'll take um a while before we get it actually in the uh in the app store i want to close out all these that we're not using now ah let's see okay okay all right let's see settings api access create service account let's just let's split the screen here so we can follow the instructions i'm gonna take it off now you're done okay good job good job baby okay all right so let's go with there's our settings maybe up here no let me make this bigger google play console i believe this is all right this is google play console there's there we go there's settings okay um api access create service accounts daddy why do you bring why'd you fill up your water and then bring your water down here daddy daddy that's still getting it's still going yeah because we have it still on okay all right so follow the google api console link in the dialog there was no dialogue just worked daddy it's coming over and over again create service account okay let's do create service account okay he's going again teddy how do we turn these off how do i turn it off you hit the button flip this little button see there you go see it'll turn off now it'll shine on the screen see it's a shutting off you see right there shutting off see now all the lines are oh there we'll stop okay uh enter a name daddy taking a long time to tell me okay it's taking a long time yeah my wife's doing that we need to all right now here daddy maybe because it's create service account oh goodness service account name daddy maybe because it's old it's not old i just got it a couple months ago all right that's right but you've had it for a long long long time hey no hitting buttons hey what are you doing select a roll users and we want a json key all right done here there we go hey you're making this difficult for me little girl what do you think no hey listen hey don't you go upstairs and play nope no you want to play down here you can't hit that keyboard why don't you go play on that computer behind you go play okay we wanted to be able to release manager click on grant access and release manager so role is release manager i guess i'm just going to keep the defaults and add a user all right cool now we can manually upload so let's go to the manual upload instructions so many instructions i definitely need to do this again like very quickly with like make another app because otherwise i will forget so much of this i do have some other apps that i never quite got finished maybe i'll try to finish them and do it what's the matter it won't turn on oh you know what because i i turned off the power strip because the fish tank was being really noisy why don't you go upstairs and play on the chromebook you want to see if you can play on the chromebook no you want to go tell the other kids that i'm i build an app for the phone yeah no oops you want to play something go see if rafael will let you play the switch you'll see if he'll turn it on for you you play mario tell him i told you too all right let's see get your app ready for testing your productions all right so we did the create application take the content rating questionnaire and set up so i believe we created the store listing right so we did all that next steps take the content rating questionnaire so how do we do it all right sign it in place select an app all right let's go into our play console we'll move it over here select an app stay focused hey now on the left menu click store presence content content rating you must upload before taking questions all right well i guess we gotta upload then let's it's very odd to manage apk files all right well i guess let's let's do the releases then and uh production track you have released it hasn't been rolled out i which one is this the key that we created uh dimitri says you need to do everything that's more called the gray checkbox step requirement if you're using the recommended app publishing format to android bundle yeah i mean i think i'll go with that one then okay on the left hand side oh thank you dimitri so demetrius everything that has this little gray checkbox needs to be done before we can distribute the app thank you that's very helpful all right so let's accept that cool let's browse files and get this apk see what this is all right i wonder if this isn't gonna work because we have a different key we're not using that key we'll see um release notes this is initial release okay view warning message all right so we could use the android app bundle all right let's see which i thought we were we did read about that and i thought we were going to try to do that all right let's let's try this then maybe we didn't build the right one i think we need to start uh let's see whoops oh i forget all right cool let that run for a minute while we take care of some of the other stuff we need to there we go all right so let's get back to that let's see if we could do this yep cool okay app category no no no no no no no cool cool looks like a good rating nice all right let's get that one done have content well let me start that okay about this one it's free and no ads integrate my services with app actions i don't really know what that is do not prove my application all right that looks good okay all right cool eventually i do want to use this with android auto but it's not ready for that yet all right cool that saves let's go back to this cool target audience uh i guess it's not what are your target age groups 18 and older i mean let's just do 18 and older how about that no there we go all right cool and we got the release and expo whoa all right all right cool so looks like we got everything we need right now um this except this build this newer build um where's what part is it at running gradle all right so got through a bunch of steps so basically we got a warning on our on our release um saying that we could have done it basically better if we used a different a different apk so i thought like hey maybe we just do this but it's still building so i guess if the build doesn't succeed very soon i'm just gonna do this just to kind of try it out for our first try and i could always try to upload the other build later on so i think that's probably demetrius says going straight to production not the best idea yeah i wasn't really sure what the uh if i should try production first or not like the app is just uh very basic and there's not going to be a big audience because you need the nerosity device to use it i thought about doing a beta what do y'all think let's let's uh decide here so who thinks we should go straight to production or should we go to beta or even alpha um so basically the options are should we go to should we do beta okay so beta track is public i kind of do want it to be public for everybody that has a nerosity notion device to try it so the options are either beta or production at this point so let me know what you think and i'll check this this is still still working oh okay we've got some all right it's actually pretty close in terms of votes here uh between beta and production it looks like one for one for beta i'm assuming dimitri is leaning towards beta since he's the one that said production isn't a good idea so beta has one two three four votes production all right production only has two so um let's give it just another like few seconds we have a vote for gamma all right again uh harris says for this kind of app i would pick production nothing to risk at all i mean yeah that's i mean i kind of thought like nothing risk how about okay productions making a comeback now i think we're about about even i just wonder what let me i want to see what the difference would be because it seems to me that if everybody if it's still like available then i guess beta would be fine because i would like let the users know to like hey this is the very first like um oh dimitri says one difference between production and beta is an app store there's a text beta in the title yeah i i could see like it's true i don't want people to think this is a completely finished app so maybe beta is the right way to go because there are definitely more features i want to add we didn't really try to make it look amazing um yeah i think i think we can try beta so we definitely want to do open beta maximum number of testers if you set the maximum it needs to be at least a thousand uh all right that's i don't really care how many people use this i don't know how many i'll just put that in uh feedback i guess all right and let's edit release all right so that's enabled let's and i guess one all right so initial release one and then all right so that's still not hey it finished all right cool let's try this one then all right so we're going to try to upload the new one we'll see if this this goes well now technically we didn't test this one so this is definitely the beta all right yeah this is it and this is an aab not an apk so it's the i guess the newer version that's recommended so it's uploading pretty quickly should be ready soon it looks like we completed all the other steps so this might be the last step and this has been quite a long stream how long have we been going for i don't even know what's the time three hours yeah that sounds about right we started at noon yeah a three hour stream crazy i'm like super hungry and actually i was supposed to there's a like an online meetup for this neurocity notion device that i can't remember if it started at two or three either way i think i'm late for it at this point all right it starts at three so i'll be i'll be fashionably late processing uhoh you need to use a different version code for your apk or your bundle because you already have a version of this code one oops um oh no wait a second different version code is that gonna does that mean if that means i have to rebuild it then i'm definitely not doing that uh where's the code at app json i'm afraid yeah version i i think we had to bump the version so i'm just gonna go back to the old the other one or i could remove it i say at this point i just used the one that we already uploaded that worked with the apk version code one and then because i don't want to go through rebuilding again that took like seven minutes to build that's i don't wait another seven minutes all right we'll try that one all right there we go and review all right which we know that that was the case so oh cool i can full roll out seconds ago okay dimitri says it's practically impossible to change the key with which you sign your app so be careful not to leak or lose it all right good um good tip thank you for that so do i need to create the release now or what set the next step all right we did that next steps publish your app i guess we do a release now no we just did one so did it did it actually release yeah i'm assuming that like release means it's it still needs to be reviewed and it's not actually available no production releases i understand that okay so we have beta cool so it's pending so they're reviewing the app so basically at this point i think everything we can do has been done uh the app review has to happen before it gets it gets launched so um this could take a while so i think there's other stuff that i want to do for the app i don't know if we'll hold off on that until we get here back from the release or we'll just keep working on it i'll i'll figure it out uh but yeah at this point i'd say we're gonna just gonna finish up the stream so um yeah thank you so much for watching i'm gonna look i've been keeping up with the chat pretty well so i don't know that there's there's too much left in here that i haven't addressed and just just double checking now also a few years saying that when uh my daughter was down there saying she's adorable a cute child thank you i appreciate it all right cool so um yeah i'm gonna finish up and thank you all so much for watching i'm gonna try to do another stream in two days so let's say saturday so probably like monday afternoon eastern time will probably be my next stream and i'm not sure what we'll what we'll do in the stream we'll work on it and um yeah oh i'll post it in in twitter so before i stream i always post in twitter in linkedin and on instagram that i'm going to stream i believe it also automatically posts to facebook as well and then if you turn on notifications for free code camp then you'll get notifications as well i do put out videos on my channel so if you would like to get notified about those as well you can check the link in the description and sign up for notifications for my channel too those are the best ways to find out when i'm when i'm going to be streaming or when i'm going to release new videos i'm going to have a new video coming out on my channel tomorrow i still have to create that video and i'm not 100 sure what it's going to be about but i have a list of topics and i'm going to pick one and make a video tonight and release it tomorrow i'm going to try for tomorrow morning as a release eastern time so i will uh hopefully be back then uh in the meantime have a great west rest of your weekend and be safe thanks
