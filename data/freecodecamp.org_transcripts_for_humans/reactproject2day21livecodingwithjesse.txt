00:07 - hey everybody it's Jesse
00:10 - and everybody this happened a Good
00:15 - Friday
00:16 - kind of nice end of the week
00:19 - looking forward to to the weekend
00:22 - although I'll still be coding over the
00:24 - weekend I'm sure it's the same with all
00:27 - of you there's always always something
00:32 - to work on
00:34 - today see I want to let you know about a
00:39 - few things before we get started so one
00:43 - really cool code school is having a free
00:48 - weekend so they're courses you go in
00:51 - there and take their courses for free so
00:54 - check that out it's cooked code school
00:56 - comm slash free weekend and thanks to
00:59 - Patrick for putting that in the live
01:02 - chat and in the slack channel for for
01:06 - our live stream so check that out not an
01:11 - official endorsement because I haven't
01:13 - taken courses from code school so I
01:15 - can't say personally whether or not it's
01:18 - a good resource but I checked out some
01:21 - of their courses just the you know the
01:23 - names of of it and I look pretty cool so
01:26 - if you if you don't have anything else
01:28 - going on this weekend then seems like a
01:32 - good opportunity there's one more thing
01:39 - okay I remember I should write this
01:42 - stuff down beforehand so I don't forget
01:44 - I so this is the style guide and I think
01:50 - I've shown this before on live strangers
01:52 - the style guide for the the university
01:57 - that I work for so I made this and this
02:00 - was actually the first react project
02:03 - that I ever worked on the reason that I
02:07 - bring this up now is because I had a
02:09 - comment on a one of my videos and
02:12 - someone had said they found
02:13 - a typo in the style guide and they they
02:18 - were going to submit a pull request to
02:20 - fix it but they couldn't find the repo
02:22 - and I thought that was odd and I thought
02:25 - well maybe I made it private it turns
02:27 - out I did so I made that repo private
02:29 - I'm not sure why but I suspect since it
02:33 - was my first react project I didn't want
02:35 - to look like a noob so I just made it
02:37 - private so now that I'm live on YouTube
02:43 - looking like a noob every day I decided
02:46 - there's no reason that it should be
02:47 - private so I did make it public so that
02:51 - repo is now public on you can find it on
02:57 - my github account which I don't know if
03:02 - I have that linked or not it's linked
03:04 - from my YouTube channel which i think is
03:08 - like linked in the video but anyway if
03:11 - you're interested you can check it out I
03:13 - wouldn't really spend too much time
03:15 - doing if you wanted like let's say to
03:19 - contribute I wouldn't spend too much
03:20 - time on this one because after looking
03:23 - at the code I think I'd really like to
03:25 - redo it and and redo it to the point of
03:28 - maybe it's better just to start a
03:30 - completely new project this was done
03:34 - using create react app but I ejected it
03:38 - really you know really soon into it was
03:42 - maybe like the third or fourth commit
03:45 - said I ran eject and I think I was just
03:49 - curious and wanted to do some things
03:52 - with the setup I wanted to use sass so
03:57 - and at the time I couldn't figure out
03:59 - how to get sass to work without ejecting
04:01 - so anyway it probably has really old
04:05 - versions of everything all the the
04:09 - packages and things are old and it's
04:12 - using materialized and not material UI
04:14 - and I think I'd rather go with material
04:17 - UI if I'm doing things in react so
04:21 - anyway just thought I'd let you know
04:24 - since there was some interest in
04:26 - in the style guide I didn't realize
04:28 - anybody was looking at it but I guess at
04:31 - least one person was alright so I'm
04:38 - gonna say hi and check the lab chat
04:39 - really quick okay cool Patrick says he's
04:45 - done some previous free weekends on with
04:50 - code school and he said it's a pretty
04:52 - good resource so awesome okay
05:02 - so let's get started I do want to say my
05:15 - normal type of kind of thing for any new
05:18 - people that are watching or maybe you've
05:21 - only watched a few times and haven't
05:22 - heard this before the point of this
05:25 - stream in particular is to just show me
05:28 - in doing my everyday work as a front-end
05:29 - developer I'm employed full-time by
05:31 - University and so it's not necessarily a
05:38 - tutorial but I try to explain what I'm
05:40 - doing as much as possible so if you're a
05:42 - beginner then it might still be
05:44 - worthwhile for you to watch even if this
05:46 - is maybe a little bit more advanced than
05:48 - than what you're currently doing because
05:51 - I'll you know I try to explain things
05:53 - and also you know not everything is done
05:59 - during the stream so from stream to
06:01 - stream there may be things that I work
06:03 - on are things that change that obviously
06:06 - I didn't get you know recorded there
06:10 - will be interruptions occasionally
06:11 - people knock on my door they call me and
06:13 - I have to stop so just wanted to get
06:16 - that all out of the way right off the
06:18 - bat if you've been watching for a while
06:20 - I know you know that but occasionally I
06:22 - do have people that are I don't know it
06:27 - seems like maybe from the comments that
06:29 - that they don't they've never heard that
06:31 - before or realized with what I'm doing
06:34 - with this stream so I just want to make
06:37 - sure when expectations are correct with
06:41 - what we're trying to do here
06:43 - alright so having said all that I
06:47 - actually have changed very little since
06:50 - yesterday
06:52 - and in fact Patrick submitted a pull
06:54 - request and basically I don't I don't
06:59 - know that I want to say fix the issues
07:01 - we were having with with standard KS
07:04 - yesterday but I guess kind of worked
07:07 - around it all right and here's the
07:09 - workaround so you can see it in two
07:11 - places first place is here at the top of
07:14 - our file
07:15 - we can set some some es Lin rules and in
07:21 - this case we're setting the global
07:24 - onmouseover on Mouse outs right so this
07:27 - would these were we're giving us errors
07:30 - saying they're not defined now there's
07:32 - no errors and then also we can do that
07:35 - in our package JSON so you can see under
07:38 - standard Global's
07:40 - we put all these things one of them
07:42 - being state so when we were defining
07:46 - state and let's see what we're doing it
07:51 - okay when we're defining state like this
07:53 - we were getting an undefined error so
07:59 - now we don't get that anymore and going
08:02 - forward for anybody submitting pool
08:04 - requests I think the best way to proceed
08:06 - with this is if you if you use something
08:11 - here with especially if you use it you
08:17 - know like this with the arrow function
08:20 - it's it's not going to it's not gonna
08:26 - recognize that right forward for a lot
08:29 - of reasons that we went over yesterday
08:30 - and I'm not gonna go into because I'm
08:32 - not exactly I'm not even exactly sure
08:34 - what the reasons are but it has
08:35 - something to do with updates to yarn NPM
08:40 - so what we will do then is in our global
08:48 - up here within the file so not in
08:51 - package JSON we're gonna put everything
08:55 - that's giving that's giving us errors or
08:58 - that we know ahead of time we'll
08:59 - probably give us errors this avoids us
09:02 - having to bind so normally we would bind
09:06 - these things we bind this for each one
09:09 - of these in our constructor right so for
09:12 - every single click for onmouseover for
09:15 - onmouseout that would be two separate
09:17 - lines so we still have to do something
09:20 - but it's it's less than what we normally
09:23 - have to do and it's way up at the top
09:24 - and it's not down here you know kind of
09:28 - clutter
09:29 - things up so we can basically do it all
09:33 - in one line and just throw it up here
09:36 - it'll work if you're going to use
09:38 - something on more than one component
09:40 - then it can go here in our package JSON
09:44 - so that's the that's kind of the
09:47 - workaround for now thanks Patrick for
09:50 - for doing that that was really good
09:53 - thinking actually because that's I mean
09:56 - it's just a very simple solution and
10:01 - this is certainly a debatable thing so I
10:07 - don't want to put this forward it's like
10:09 - this is the solution that everybody
10:10 - should use because it's there certainly
10:14 - might be a different way or better way
10:17 - to get these working without errors and
10:19 - it's debatable as to whether or not this
10:23 - is even the best way to do things you
10:26 - know the older way of using the
10:27 - constructor is still in the react
10:30 - documentation binding with this inside
10:36 - the constructor is in the react
10:37 - documentation it does mention this
10:39 - property initializer syntax but it does
10:43 - it says that it's experimental so this
10:45 - is certainly not the standard way I like
10:48 - it
10:49 - I've been doing it that way for the last
10:52 - at least the last two projects I think
10:54 - including this one and so I've gotten
10:58 - used to it I like it it's more concise
11:01 - and I don't have a problem telling you
11:04 - know being able to know what's going on
11:06 - I have read you know online some people
11:10 - saying that they're not sure you know
11:12 - what's going on when they see that but I
11:13 - don't know I think it's pretty
11:14 - straightforward so I'd like to keep
11:17 - using that but I certainly understand it
11:20 - let's say if you were to submit a pull
11:22 - request using the older way of doing
11:25 - things I'm not opposed to that I'm not
11:29 - gonna say that you need to change it so
11:34 - with with that said we're gonna move
11:36 - forward when I do things you know I'll
11:39 - do it with the property initializer
11:41 - syntax
11:43 - but I just stuff I definitely don't want
11:45 - to put that forward like this is the way
11:47 - to do it because I don't think that
11:49 - that's at least from what I've
11:51 - researched it's it's certainly not a
11:54 - decided issue yet
12:03 - okay
12:06 - so actually I just got a link from so
12:11 - then put a link in about this buying
12:13 - issue so I'm gonna I'm gonna open that
12:15 - up on my other screen so I don't forget
12:17 - but I'm not gonna go over it right now
12:22 - because I've already talked for a long
12:25 - time without doing any coding so I'd
12:26 - like to get started on the coding but
12:28 - thank you Ben I will check that out as
12:30 - soon as I'm done with with the stream
12:35 - and what we were working on yesterday so
12:41 - just to catch everyone up we're building
12:43 - great with react we use create react app
12:46 - and we've got a bunch of other kind of
12:49 - nice tools that we're working with to
12:52 - autoformat our code and so the basic
12:56 - function of what we're building is to
12:58 - provide resources like logo images and
13:03 - information to people who work at this
13:08 - university that I work at and also allow
13:10 - them through a form to submit requests
13:13 - for work so we're working today on this
13:20 - section and so yesterday we we set some
13:25 - things up to be able to attract the
13:26 - scroll position of the user on the page
13:30 - and to also get the values of the Y
13:34 - position of each of these these are all
13:38 - h3s that I'm highlighting each of these
13:41 - age threes the plan today is to change
13:46 - this side menu here to reflect the names
13:51 - of these headers and to have as we
13:55 - scroll down have the appropriate name be
13:59 - highlighted okay and not only that but
14:04 - we'd like it if if you happen to click
14:06 - on one of those names that it would
14:08 - scroll automatically to that section
14:10 - okay so we're gonna be adapting this
14:13 - this component comes in material UI and
14:17 - I think it's called
14:19 - pepper immaterial UI so it's not exactly
14:23 - intended for this kind of thing but it's
14:25 - close enough that I think we can adapt
14:27 - it pretty pretty easily I don't think
14:31 - it'll take too much work to do this so
14:33 - that's where we're at that's what's
14:35 - what's going on so if you want to follow
14:42 - along in the repo we're in the planning
14:47 - guide Jas is where we'll be at for
14:50 - probably all of this maybe we'll put
14:54 - some styles in a sass file but other
14:57 - than that we're gonna be hanging out in
14:59 - this file so I'm gonna close our folder
15:03 - tree view and just give us some more
15:06 - space I'll make this a bit bigger for
15:09 - you all let's see so we need
15:20 - see I need I need to get my mind wrapped
15:23 - around where we left off I had meetings
15:25 - all morning and so I didn't I didn't get
15:28 - a chance to work on this
15:39 - okay all right so currently our header
15:43 - positions are here in an array and then
15:45 - our scroll position is here under scroll
15:48 - Y so let's change let's change the
15:57 - values here for this step or just to
16:00 - make it a bit more obvious with the what
16:04 - this is supposed to do I keep having to
16:06 - explain what it's going to do because we
16:09 - still have all these default things here
16:11 - so let's change that and for now I think
16:17 - I'm just going to I'm just gonna
16:23 - manually put put the sections in I think
16:27 - if we had more sections it would be a
16:29 - better idea to grab the text of each h3
16:34 - and then loop over let's say we had an
16:42 - array of the text for each of the h3 s
16:45 - loop over that and then create these but
16:48 - since we only have what three or four
16:50 - I'm just gonna put them in here and
16:59 - all right
17:04 - I'll just copy and paste these actually
17:08 - this will be faster let me drag this
17:10 - over on my other screen and it'll be a
17:12 - lot faster for me to copy and paste that
17:33 - I may shorten some of these up we'll see
17:35 - how how they display but I'd rather not
17:38 - have them wrap onto another line so
17:41 - we'll see if that's necessary and we
17:45 - need to add few more just one more right
17:51 - there's only four
18:01 - and let's give this a step index of
18:04 - three
18:17 - and they should be
18:23 - two three yes if he should be three as
18:26 - well all right see how that looks
18:33 - oops
18:38 - okay that's actually and not bad
19:00 - now that I look at this I think it's
19:02 - worded a bit I don't like how it's
19:07 - worded right so it says please follow
19:09 - these guidelines and so it says plan
19:13 - ahead proof the job in a timely manner
19:16 - so those are like saying here's what you
19:17 - do right you have to plan ahead you have
19:20 - to prove drove in a timely manner and
19:21 - then this just says budget information I
19:24 - think it might be better if it just said
19:26 - budget right like you need to budget and
19:29 - then obviously this is information about
19:31 - budgeting normally I don't make
19:36 - decisions about content we have content
19:39 - editors that just tell me what to do but
19:43 - I think I'm gonna change that and we'll
19:46 - just see how it goes they'll definitely
19:48 - make me change it back they don't like
19:51 - that
20:04 - budget
20:10 - following that same logic services would
20:15 - probably go better up here's a planet
20:19 - and I guess would be better if it's a
20:26 - plan ahead to services budget proof the
20:28 - job in a timely manner
20:40 - maybe services could go after budget I'm
20:43 - gonna leave it alone for now oh this is
20:46 - not really my area
20:47 - I'll let the content people deal with
20:50 - that but now that we kind of after we
20:53 - had it kind of displayed over here it
20:54 - just it looks looked a little odd to me
20:59 - I think we can I think we can get rid of
21:04 - this one two three four I mean the steps
21:09 - are somewhat logical but right now at
21:12 - least the position of services throws
21:14 - things off a bit a bit because that's
21:17 - obviously not the last step so we're
21:20 - going to remove this reset and we're
21:27 - gonna remove this click a step and then
21:29 - I guess we'll remove these as well
21:46 - so you don't need yeah this entire
21:50 - paragraph we can get rid of and
22:00 - you know if you get rid of this
22:16 - yeah hopefully this won't break things
22:19 - and I think we don't need these buttons
22:22 - anymore not
22:29 - okay great so we have gotten rid of that
22:33 - good okay so it's still doing some
22:36 - things that we don't really want it to
22:37 - do but we'll get we got something
22:40 - through many a oops forgot to set my
22:47 - Pomodoro timer it's so let's set it now
22:52 - better late than never so we may need to
22:59 - let's check out the options in material
23:02 - UI if there's not an option to change
23:05 - how this looks then we can always just
23:09 - use some CSS to override things I'd
23:14 - rather not directly modify the component
23:19 - in material UI so I think it would be
23:21 - better in this case to just change
23:24 - essentially just hide this with CSS
23:29 - assuming that there's no option and we
23:33 - need
23:48 - okay it looks like we we may be able to
23:53 - put whatever we want inside the step
24:12 - okay so right now we're using this step
24:14 - button which I'm assuming that's that's
24:18 - what's giving us our this kind of circle
24:25 - with the checkbox there so if we changed
24:28 - it and we didn't use a step button but
24:31 - instead I mean we replace this with
24:36 - anything really if we leave the on click
24:45 - the unclick yeah I don't think we'll be
24:53 - changing state
25:03 - yeah I don't think will change state
25:05 - well we want to do unclick you scroll to
25:10 - a certain position yeah so let's just
25:19 - first let's try changing this let's just
25:23 - make it a span for now just see what it
25:27 - what it looks like all right cool
25:32 - so let's change all of these two spans
25:47 - see how that looks whoa all right still
25:51 - want to get rid of these but okay not
25:59 - that we want to add add some styling to
26:05 - that but we've gotten rid of the other
26:09 - thing so
26:21 - okay I want to see how this looks now in
26:23 - the
26:29 - and he's you know
26:45 - okay
27:14 - I'm gonna try
27:26 - let me make sure I'm gonna make this a
27:31 - bit smaller so we can see both both
27:33 - things I believe we can scroll
28:01 - was it
28:07 - no let's just be honored right no this
28:12 - whole table is not a function
28:22 - hmm
28:25 - I thought we'd use this we'll use
28:35 - okay so that's just giving us our
28:49 - let's try with window oh we need sorry
29:01 - let's try that again
29:03 - I remember how to do it now there we go
29:10 - okay so we can do this and it'll scroll
29:14 - us around so if you saw that I'm just
29:16 - typing in different values for scroll
29:18 - top I'm setting scroll top to whatever I
29:22 - want it to be okay so that's that's how
29:25 - we do it you'd see I was a little
29:27 - confused at first and I was trying to
29:29 - set it in here and dev tools kept
29:32 - telling me that it wasn't a function and
29:34 - it just didn't register at first okay
29:43 - so first we're gonna do it like this a
29:46 - nicer way to do this would be to
29:49 - gradually scroll so maybe we'll
29:52 - implement some sort of smooth scrolling
29:54 - I have done that on previous projects
29:57 - it's possible I use jQuery for it but it
30:01 - I think it would be worthwhile for me to
30:02 - look up how I did it before and see if I
30:06 - could just adapt that so here's what we
30:13 - want to do on click me grab this so on
30:20 - click we want to
30:30 - see
30:34 - you want to go scroll top equals this
30:40 - set or this state and let's go with call
30:50 - that header physicians okay so to go
30:53 - this state header positions
31:06 - and
31:14 - header positions and we can actually use
31:18 - the step index right we have we do have
31:25 - the step in ducks here correct yeah so
31:28 - we can use the step index
31:39 - no we can't because I'm not setting the
31:42 - step index anymore
31:52 - all right I may have to rethink I'm
31:56 - doing this for now I'm just gonna
31:58 - manually put a few of these in and
32:07 - that'll at least be able to test the
32:10 - next step
32:37 - okay
32:41 - let's see cool alright so this is
32:46 - working it's taking us to the sections
32:49 - gray awesome okay so that's I think that
32:55 - was actually the second step as I
32:57 - explained it before but that ended up
32:59 - being easier to implement so one of the
33:04 - things that we wanted to do is implement
33:06 - it and the next thing is just going to
33:15 - be to highlight this if we're in that
33:20 - the right area you know kind of so as we
33:23 - scroll down and that highlight whether
33:26 - or not something is highlighted will be
33:29 - determined by our Y our scroll Y and our
33:36 - header positions so let's see so I think
33:45 - we should give position of active
33:52 - section
33:55 - and
34:02 - let's see zero so we'll use the index of
34:12 - each section I think that that we yeah
34:16 - that should be the easiest way so
34:18 - section 1 which would be 0 right because
34:21 - we're zero indexing section 1 will be
34:28 - the default because that's just going to
34:30 - be the top of the page basically the top
34:33 - we're not including that first h2 but
34:36 - this will work so active section is 0 so
34:41 - let's see
35:12 - all right let me let me just kind of
35:16 - explain out loud what I'm thinking for
35:18 - the next step so we will make the active
35:27 - the active section will be based on a
35:30 - comparison between the scroll Y and the
35:35 - header positions that comparison will
35:37 - happen every time handle scroll runs
35:43 - will do that same comparison so I
35:52 - suppose inside handle scroll will do
35:56 - that will it'll be something like like a
36:03 - note like this set state but it'll be
36:10 - maybe a switch statement that may be the
36:14 - best way to do it because there's going
36:16 - to be conditions so if scroll Y is
36:18 - between certain values then that's going
36:21 - to change it will change the state here
36:28 - for our active section
36:34 - so then for each one of these we're
36:38 - gonna have to have some sort of check to
36:41 - say if the active section corresponds to
36:45 - this this section that's represented by
36:49 - by these labels then we're gonna want to
36:55 - make it bold or something I actually
36:57 - haven't even decided with the what the
36:59 - indicator is going to be does that make
37:07 - sense
37:14 - okay I know there's a delay so give
37:16 - everybody like 30 seconds to respond I
37:20 - don't want to lose anyone so let me know
37:22 - if it doesn't make sense but that's what
37:26 - we'll be working on okay Patrick I just
37:31 - I saw your comment about the the warning
37:36 - so at 31st he is like okay cool so
37:53 - Patrick's saying that these these that
37:56 - he put the first line that he put up
38:03 - here was to take care of the areas that
38:06 - I'm seeing in the console step but mr.
38:12 - fun
38:26 - I'm just gonna clean things up a bit and
38:29 - then I'll check the live chat before we
38:31 - go move on
39:01 - now that I look at this I think we're
39:07 - we're really not using very much of the
39:10 - functionality at all of this stepper
39:15 - essentially it's just providing us with
39:21 - just kind of the layout of a list of
39:24 - things vertically so I guess we didn't
39:26 - really need to use the separ we'll see
39:29 - once we're finished with it once we're
39:32 - finished with that we may be able to
39:33 - just switch these over to divs or a
39:35 - maybe a ul and it would probably work
39:46 - especially since we have this we have
39:49 - some of the styles here too
39:57 - guess we don't need the back button
40:00 - there Styles action I don't think we
40:05 - even have the actions anymore
40:09 - I'm not sure what part was the content
40:15 - let's see
40:21 - okay yeah that's the list here that
40:23 - works this is drops
40:53 - oh here we go forgot to take this one up
41:44 - hmm who did
41:53 - yeah we're definitely not even really
41:56 - using most of what's going on with this
42:03 - with this stepper
42:10 - so let's just get rid of this
42:24 - okay and still
42:34 - there we go
43:09 - you will see I'm just was trying to get
43:12 - rid of some of these errors these crops
43:15 - from the element planting I had one of
43:22 - four I thought I removed all of those I
43:30 - can't find them
43:32 - [Music]
43:41 - well maybe now might be the best time to
43:44 - just switch this over from this step to
43:50 - ul
43:58 - yes
44:07 - yeah I think that'll be the way to go so
44:17 - let's get rid of this
44:18 - I mean why why import you know this
44:20 - component if we're not even really using
44:22 - it so I mean this was kind of useful
44:24 - just to help frame how we were going to
44:27 - think about this but now it's pretty
44:33 - obvious that this is not going to be
44:35 - necessary
44:59 - okay and that should take care of great
45:03 - so you took care of those little lines
45:05 - which is pretty awesome so we'll need to
45:07 - add a little bit of padding and
45:09 - everything but much better we're gonna
45:13 - get rid of Stefan stuff here define I've
45:18 - never used yeah there we go
45:22 - get rid of that okay so now get rid of
45:31 - those error messages and the click yeah
45:33 - so this still works so everything that
45:35 - we've done with clicking still works
45:37 - great all right I said I was going to
45:43 - check the live chat quickly so I'm gonna
45:45 - do that now yeah so let me just check
45:48 - the live chat now since I started this
45:51 - timer late anyway so we're gonna do the
45:52 - five minutes if you're not familiar with
45:55 - with this stream and haven't seen it
45:58 - before we do Pomodoro's
46:00 - timer so 25 minutes of coding five
46:04 - minutes I check the live chat we do that
46:06 - maybe two or three times and then we
46:08 - finish up and the last part of the
46:12 - stream is just cue a question-and-answer
46:25 - see
46:28 - so I'm just gonna scroll up a bit and
46:30 - see what I missed
46:41 - so someone asked if angularjs is worth
46:44 - learning I just say it depends on what
46:47 - would you want to learn if you're
46:49 - interested in that if there's jobs if at
46:52 - a certain company you know that uses
46:55 - angular then it's definitely worth
46:57 - learning depends also you know how much
47:00 - time you have if you have a lot of time
47:03 - you know go ahead and and learn it you
47:05 - know you could learn it without even
47:07 - really having a good reason to yeah but
47:11 - it just definitely depends on what
47:12 - you're what you're trying to do Blake
47:18 - also at Blake asked brackets i over
47:22 - PSA's vs code it's a Visual Studio code
47:24 - so I don't know I've never used brackets
47:28 - so I can't really compare I have used
47:30 - Visual Studio code and I like it but
47:32 - like I said since I haven't used
47:34 - brackets I can't really answer that
47:35 - question
47:46 - braxton says hey Jessie how's it going
47:48 - I'm doing all right huh how's everything
47:51 - going with you thanks for watching okay
48:01 - Rohan has a good question
48:03 - Rohan says I know you have a job
48:06 - currently but if you were to change jobs
48:07 - or go freelance again would you
48:09 - advertise yourself as a reactive or
48:11 - front-end slash full-stack
48:14 - yeah I wonder I
48:24 - I guess I would feel comfortable at this
48:26 - point calling myself a reactive that's
48:29 - not to say I think I'm an expert at
48:30 - react but I've been developing sites
48:33 - you'll react sites for a while so I
48:37 - would do that I'm deaf obviously I'm
48:41 - comfortable with front-end I don't know
48:43 - about full stack I'm getting more
48:45 - confident at at doing things other than
48:48 - front-end so I don't know I'd have to do
48:52 - a little bit more with back-end before I
48:54 - be comfortable saying full stack but I
48:59 - don't think I'm that far away from from
49:03 - being able to say that honestly so maybe
49:06 - I guess it would just depend on what
49:08 - what I really wanted to do if I read if
49:10 - I knew I really wanted to do react which
49:12 - at this point I I really like react so I
49:15 - may end up just saying reactive yeah I
49:21 - may I may do react because I I would
49:26 - like that and then just for the type of
49:28 - company react is is somewhat new so I
49:32 - would know that if there is a company
49:34 - that is using react and they're looking
49:36 - specifically for react dev the odds of
49:38 - them being open to adopting new things
49:40 - like sooner are probably greater than a
49:45 - company that is just looking for a front
49:47 - end of and you know who knows they could
49:50 - be using you know in anything so I guess
49:55 - it would for me at least I'd like to
49:57 - have a job where I'm you know I'm
49:59 - somewhere the
50:00 - comfortable trying new things and trying
50:03 - to stay you know as cutting edge as is
50:05 - reasonable so I guess the answer the
50:09 - question right now after I've thought
50:10 - about it is I think I would market
50:12 - myself as a react dev
50:29 - okay then I just saw your comments about
50:32 - the material UI components and all the
50:35 - props so I mean I guess at this point it
50:38 - doesn't matter but thank you for for
50:40 - letting me know about that break point
50:45 - asks why are you implementing scroll
50:47 - instead of the anchor we're doing the
50:50 - scroll well basically it's easy to get
50:56 - it so my times up here so let me let me
50:59 - start this again but this is a good
51:01 - segue back into the code so the the
51:06 - reason I went with the scroll instead of
51:08 - the anchor so I originally I was
51:10 - planning on doing the anchor and I think
51:12 - I had yeah so I even added in IDs
51:16 - thinking that I would go with the anchor
51:19 - but I really don't need the idea is now
51:23 - because we end up going with this index
51:25 - and since we've indexed the positions
51:31 - the header positions here then when we
51:39 - click on these it's easier just to go by
51:42 - the index I I think it's easier just go
51:49 - by the index at this point especially if
51:53 - we were to let's say like create these
51:56 - dynamically okay so that's one reason is
52:00 - it was just easier when I was doing this
52:02 - to say like okay we have the value
52:04 - stored in an array so let's just go with
52:06 - the index the second reason though is if
52:09 - I want to implement some sort of smooth
52:12 - scrolling feature I know I don't know
52:18 - like I said I need to go back and look
52:20 - at how I've done this in the past but I
52:22 - think it will be easier to implement by
52:26 - the position because I believe what I've
52:29 - done in the past is gotten the ID
52:33 - determine what the position was and then
52:36 - set up scrolling based on the position
52:39 - anyway so and
52:41 - in that scenario it wouldn't really
52:43 - matter you know we wouldn't be using the
52:46 - anchor to navigate so does that make
52:47 - sense
52:48 - I mean maybe I'm thinking about this
52:51 - wrong and you know maybe it'll be
52:53 - clearer later on for me but probably
52:57 - what will end up happening is I'll I'll
52:59 - have some sort of like smooth scrolling
53:02 - happen and it'll be more beneficial for
53:04 - me to know the position anyway
53:37 - okay I was just checking the the last
53:40 - little bit there and in the latch at
53:47 - okay so I didn't get through everything
53:49 - so I'll come back after this Pomodoro
53:50 - session and I'll start back you know
53:53 - right with the comments right after we
53:55 - talked about using the anchor so so any
54:00 - comments made after 226 p.m. Eastern
54:04 - Time
54:05 - I will get to those in about 20 minutes
54:09 - all right so let's move on I really
54:12 - think we can get this working before we
54:17 - finish so that's the goal today I'm not
54:21 - worried about having its style 100%
54:23 - properly but at least having it
54:27 - functional I think it's a good goal and
54:30 - it's definitely reasonable
54:40 - okay so let's do our we're gonna do this
54:45 - on handle scroll right now I want to do
54:49 - this on handle scroll because it's being
54:51 - throttled right so we're tracking the
54:54 - scroll we have our event listener but
54:58 - we're only calling handle scroll every
55:02 - you know 200 milliseconds so this is
55:08 - where we want it let's do
55:23 - all right let's do a switch statement
55:26 - I'm gonna have to look up on my other
55:28 - screen how to do a switch statement
55:30 - because I have not typed out a switch
55:32 - statement in a long time I remember when
55:39 - I was first learning how to do a switch
55:40 - statement I made a text-based game and
55:44 - depending on how you answered the
55:46 - questions it did different things and it
55:49 - was just one big switch statement I
55:51 - think it's on my github yeah I think I
55:55 - did put it on github it was like a Lord
55:57 - of the Rings kind of game and I think it
56:02 - used alerts yeah so it's probably I
56:06 - haven't looked at it in years it's
56:11 - probably pretty terrible but the whole
56:12 - point was for me to learn how to use a
56:14 - switch statement all right so on my
56:20 - other screen I just opened up the ND mdn
56:25 - page on switch statements and I'm just
56:27 - gonna paste in there example to say
56:31 - sometime alright great so the switch
56:39 - statement is we're gonna pass in the
56:50 - scroll wide yeah we're gonna pass in
56:53 - scroll why
57:00 - scroll why and then the first case is
57:07 - going to be
57:15 - I see you scroll I actually let me see
57:20 - this
57:27 - I guess it would be
57:37 - oops
57:42 - yeah we won't even really need the first
57:45 - value at all since the top of the page
57:47 - who have it highlighted so we'll just
57:48 - skip right to the neck the second value
57:50 - so if wait a second I need to read let
58:11 - me take five seconds to read about
58:14 - switch statements because like totally
58:19 - just drawing a blank
58:20 - with how to do a switch statement so
58:24 - what I want to do basically is something
58:28 - like if the first case will be is if
58:34 - scroll Scroll Y is less than now
58:46 - yeah if scroll Y is greater than
58:57 - header this state header physicians one
59:12 - they were it
59:13 - okay so you know I'm trying to do
59:45 - okay let me try it like this
59:57 - okay this is how I think it would work
60:01 - all right so for the switch I want it to
60:05 - match true right so if this is true then
60:09 - it's gonna do what's in here right does
60:11 - that make that makes more sense we'll
60:14 - find out in a few seconds so for now why
60:23 - did they put these brakes let me get rid
60:26 - of these or at least that's and I do
60:42 - want this default so
60:54 - one
61:04 - oops
61:10 - to
61:19 - let's see this is greater than
61:38 - let's see
61:52 - I think I'm doing this backwards from
61:54 - what it should be
62:03 - so what I should ever do is if it's less
62:10 - than the first position then it's going
62:16 - to be header one there we go if it's
62:20 - less than the second then it's going to
62:26 - be oh yeah header header two
62:46 - three and then this last case will be
62:49 - for
63:05 - three
63:10 - do you think suppose someone lets
63:14 - everyone listen to all right let's try
63:18 - this out what did I do
63:30 - all right so let's see what we get okay
63:34 - cool so four three two one
63:40 - alright so normally if someone would
63:43 - start at the top of the page there at
63:44 - the top of the page let's see as we go
63:47 - down having one that's cool 1 1 1 1 1
63:53 - now we switch to 2 right there perfect
63:56 - yeah that's where we want to switch and
63:58 - now 3 and finally 4
64:04 - all right cool so that works just like
64:08 - we want it to work now we just need to
64:12 - switch it out instead of consult logging
64:14 - we need to highlight one of these
64:20 - depending on where we're at on the page
64:23 - so let's do that so I think
64:37 - it's the best way to do this
64:59 - I think if I can put
65:10 - I do this
65:21 - I don't think I can I was trying to put
65:26 - a ternary in style but I'm pretty sure
65:30 - you can't do that can you put one inside
65:36 - an element let's see I don't know if
65:39 - I've ever tried this before let's just
65:41 - try it and see what happens
65:44 - so actually see we want
66:00 - step content I don't think we need this
66:04 - anymore right yeah let's get rid of that
66:08 - I didn't realize I already had a switch
66:12 - statement on the page that would have
66:15 - would have simplified things okay so
66:20 - let's do something here so active
66:39 - okay I already have active section okay
66:41 - cool so actually to test this all I need
66:46 - to do is is active section
67:05 - see if I can do this
67:20 - I don't think this is gonna work but
67:24 - let's see
67:29 - we
67:44 - let's see now I knew I'd get in there
67:46 - alright let's see
67:55 - let's check the live chat really quick
68:00 - alright nothing in there okay so good to
68:04 - know we can't do this we can't do this
68:08 - so let's see
68:42 - at least I can see if I like the font
68:44 - weight all right so that's that's not I
68:48 - think at least can see the difference in
68:50 - it I do it here actually this is toship
69:04 - this is an object
69:09 - if I could do it in here
69:20 - I don't think this will work either this
69:24 - would be the last silly thing I tried
69:25 - that
69:32 - Oh needs to be this state active section
69:42 - whoa
69:44 - did that really work actually so it kind
69:52 - of worked
69:55 - let me try it on another one
69:59 - [Applause]
70:09 - okay yeah it doesn't work what I was
70:14 - trying to do was check to see if the
70:18 - active section equal zero then oh yeah
70:23 - wait a second maybe it did work and I
70:26 - just I just did it wrong okay cool so
70:29 - that like I said it kind of works
70:34 - because it doesn't update see should I
70:46 - do this
70:56 - let's see
71:25 - all right so what uh what I'm trying to
71:28 - do which was probably obvious is I want
71:33 - to change the font weight based on where
71:40 - we're at on the page
71:48 - Oh have I not changed active section yet
71:52 - yeah oh all right that was silly I
71:55 - haven't actually changed that to section
71:58 - so this is this sad state
72:11 - [Music]
72:23 - this may end up working this one too so
72:34 - right now there are a lot of things
72:36 - hard-coded in here that could probably
72:38 - be done in a more automatically I guess
72:49 - but for now it's this works
72:59 - oh look at that it worked a little bit I
73:05 - didn't put it on the other ones yet all
73:07 - right so check that out we have the
73:11 - highlighting its changing awesome let's
73:21 - put that on these other guys
73:22 - alright so cool so this is really good
73:28 - to know I hope I remember this next time
73:30 - I try it because I know I've done this
73:31 - before and went through the same thing
73:33 - if you're trying to apply a certain
73:40 - style to an element in line if you try
73:47 - to put the entire style object you know
73:53 - inside this ternary it does not work but
73:56 - if you inside that object since this is
74:01 - just JavaScript anyway for the value and
74:04 - the key value pair if you put the
74:07 - ternary there then it works so if you're
74:13 - not familiar with this this is like I
74:17 - don't what they call it one of you are
74:20 - the one that that showed me how to do
74:22 - this it may have been Patrick and I
74:24 - think you call it like a short-circuit
74:26 - or something like that so basically it's
74:29 - like we're checking to see if this if
74:33 - the active section is equal to zero
74:37 - instead of putting you know let's say
74:40 - the question mark and then 500 and then
74:45 - a colon and putting out of the default
74:48 - font weight value there we can just say
74:53 - we just put this in here basically and
74:56 - then so whatever happens after that is
75:00 - just gonna happen you know automatically
75:03 - if this is true and if it's false
75:04 - nothing happens right because if it's
75:09 - false it's it doesn't go any further
75:11 - right so
75:15 - anyway so it's just a little shortcut so
75:21 - let's put these here and here and two
75:31 - three I just got the feeling like I
75:38 - recreated a lot of what that stepper
75:41 - already did but oh well it works cool
75:46 - and see see so this is working
75:48 - oh no I don't know if you saw that so if
75:57 - I click on one the other ones still
76:00 - highlighted I think what we need to do
76:02 - in our switch statement then is put
76:04 - equal to less than or equal to for all
76:07 - these and that should fix it so let's
76:16 - double check
76:21 - I know it doesn't if we move down just a
76:23 - bit hmm
76:34 - less than equal to
76:40 - oh no now we don't need me equal to
76:43 - let's see
77:00 - and position
77:06 - listen
77:23 - I think if I had just adjusted like this
77:31 - let's see
77:39 - there we go so that was enough so if we
77:45 - just adjusted it so it's one pixel less
77:49 - than that that solved the problem
77:51 - because when we click it is taking us
77:53 - exactly to where that is so there we go
78:00 - all right awesome and that was pretty
78:02 - good timing because this just beeped
78:04 - about a minute ago so I'm gonna do the
78:07 - five minutes let me check the time
78:11 - actually I might I might wrap things up
78:17 - now and just check the live chat do a
78:19 - little question answer now because we
78:21 - basically accomplished what we wanted to
78:23 - for this I'm obviously not gonna leave
78:25 - it like this style wise so I'm gonna get
78:30 - rid of these these discs the bullet
78:34 - points I'm gonna get rid of I'm gonna
78:37 - make these let's see if that font size I
78:42 - think this could do with a bit bigger
78:45 - font size obviously some better spacing
78:49 - between these and maybe maybe something
78:56 - more pronounced here to show what
78:59 - section you're on I'm thinking like
79:01 - possibly a a very small left border that
79:07 - moves as we go up and down and that
79:11 - would that border could be our accent
79:14 - our current accent color which is this
79:18 - yellow
79:27 - yeah I think that'll that'll look look a
79:30 - lot better also we're gonna want to set
79:32 - our cursor to pointer when it goes over
79:34 - these just to give a visual indication
79:39 - that this these are clickable all right
79:47 - yeah that's that sounds like that'll
79:51 - that'll look good so I'll probably work
79:54 - on that maybe before I leave
79:58 - actually I've been meaning to stop at
80:00 - the post office for like a week or two
80:03 - and I never get out of work in enough
80:05 - time before the post office closes so I
80:08 - may be leaving a bit early earlier than
80:11 - normal to be able to make it to the post
80:12 - office so if I don't get this to this
80:15 - today than Monday morning I'll make
80:18 - those changes
80:22 - so the code portion of this stream is
80:29 - done so if you just wanted to stick
80:31 - around for the code now that was a good
80:35 - time to to leave and totally understand
80:38 - if you got some other stuff you need to
80:40 - do thank you so much for watching I'll
80:42 - be back on Monday if you can stick
80:45 - around for the question and answer that
80:47 - would be great even if you don't have a
80:48 - question I'd really like your input and
80:51 - a live chat to help answer some some of
80:54 - the questions that we get so so right
80:59 - now I'm gonna scroll back up to where we
81:00 - left off at so if you have any questions
81:02 - put them in the live chat quickly
81:05 - because once I get to the bottom we'll
81:07 - wrap things up and in the stream if you
81:11 - can't stick around to hear the answer to
81:14 - your question you can check out the
81:18 - replay of this this video the recording
81:20 - and that will be available on the free
81:22 - code camp Channel you could also send me
81:25 - a message on Twitter or any other social
81:28 - media platform that you like and I'll
81:31 - try to answer your question there as
81:34 - soon as I get a chance
81:37 - okay
81:52 - okay I think I found where I left off at
81:55 - and I'm not going to read out everything
81:58 - in the live chat but the questions
82:00 - especially questions from from people
82:03 - who are new I definitely want to try to
82:05 - get to those questions and make sure
82:07 - everyone feels welcome
82:19 - okay Blake said Blake it asks a question
82:21 - about bracket zero versus Visual Studio
82:24 - code and he says brackets tayo does not
82:27 - work with github repos so string did do
82:32 - you mean that it doesn't have and it
82:35 - doesn't reflect any of the the state of
82:43 - of get like visually in there I'm not
82:48 - exactly sure what you mean by that so I
82:50 - guess let me know I probably won't be
82:53 - switching editors but it would be good
82:56 - to know maybe especially if there's
82:58 - other people watching that may be
83:01 - considering it
83:11 - dinesh asks is Redux mandatory and been
83:17 - been said no but it is recommended it's
83:19 - pretty standard pattern for react yeah
83:22 - for sure I've I've actually I'm building
83:25 - a react project with Redux right now and
83:29 - it's it's just like a react blog you can
83:33 - post you new blog posts and comment and
83:36 - vote on comments and on posts and I'm
83:40 - doing that for the Udacity react nano
83:42 - degree I'm using Redux for that but I've
83:44 - actually never used Redux for any of my
83:47 - other react projects so yeah it's
83:50 - definitely not mandatory but now that
83:53 - I'm learning it I can see that it would
83:58 - give you a big advantage and keeping
84:02 - keeping track of especially if you had a
84:04 - bigger project things could get things
84:08 - get a little bit crazy with trying to
84:10 - pass state down through so many child
84:13 - components yeah it would Redux makes
84:18 - things a lot easier to reason about so
84:21 - anyway I definitely recommend it unless
84:25 - unless you're doing a really small
84:28 - project then you probably don't need
84:30 - Redux but otherwise it's probably good
84:32 - idea to use Redux or I mean there are
84:34 - other alternatives to Redux too that you
84:37 - could use Jess Quran asks which is the
84:45 - best channel to keep yourself updated
84:46 - related to web then says these videos
84:51 - are using pretty up-to-date stuff and
84:54 - level up I don't know I always don't
84:57 - know how people pronounce this but I
84:58 - always say level up Tut's
85:00 - so - UTS but he says it's it's a good
85:03 - it's also good for some of the newer
85:06 - things cool yeah I mean I would I I try
85:13 - to do newer stuff when I can I mean I
85:15 - don't I don't use new stuff just to use
85:17 - it because it's new and if it has to be
85:19 - of some value to the project but I real
85:23 - I tried to do something new on every
85:27 - project that I that I use so even if you
85:34 - know most of my projects are probably
85:35 - gonna be react there's some things that
85:38 - I may need to work on where I can't use
85:40 - react because of I have to work it
85:43 - within an existing system but I am gonna
85:47 - try to use some new technology that I've
85:51 - never used before so I guess I guess you
85:54 - know Ben's right this will normally be
85:57 - pretty up-to-date
86:03 - looks like there's there's some decent
86:05 - discussion on the merits of Visual
86:09 - Studio code versus brackets
86:29 - okay and it looks like I've got some a
86:32 - clearer picture so what Blake was
86:34 - meaning by github and and brackets is
86:38 - the git integration is is not great
87:08 - so it evidently it breaks live reload if
87:14 - you using it so like I said I don't know
87:17 - I don't use it so I'm not I'm not
87:21 - exactly sure but anybody anybody that
87:27 - uses brackets maybe if you could help
87:29 - out in the live set or in the comments
87:32 - to this video and see if you had any
87:34 - trouble using get with the live preview
87:39 - if so have you found anywhere to work
87:42 - around that or get get it to work
87:53 - Rowland earlier I commented on a on a
87:59 - JavaScript text-based game that I had
88:02 - made that was I was trying to learn how
88:04 - to do switch statements and I mentioned
88:06 - that I used JavaScript alerts for it and
88:08 - Rohan says JavaScript alerts used and
88:12 - loved by scammers and learner's alike
88:13 - indeed yes I really want to go back and
88:19 - play that game now I I think I actually
88:25 - have either a code pen or something on
88:28 - jsfiddle I'm gonna have to go back and
88:31 - look at that that repo
88:34 - because now now I'm just curious it's
88:37 - always it's fun to look at previous
88:42 - projects and just kind of see just like
88:48 - whoa see what you were thinking or how
88:54 - far you've come here it is I'm moving it
88:57 - onto the screen right now I'm just gonna
88:58 - show you oh so you can see look how
88:59 - simple it is one javascript file and to
89:02 - read me at least I put in a readme that
89:05 - I mean that's pretty good this was
89:08 - probably one of the first things I ever
89:10 - used github for let's see the sewers
89:18 - okay yeah so you can see this big switch
89:22 - switch statement
89:36 - yeah defeated you are cool so anyway
89:40 - actually it's not as big as I thought it
89:43 - seemed really big at the time so that's
89:46 - my JavaScript game I should have saved
89:48 - that for like Thursday I could have done
89:50 - throwback Thursday or that project but
89:52 - anyway yeah feel free to play that
89:56 - whenever you want it's super fun you can
90:00 - you can get through all the game content
90:02 - in less than a minute if anyone who is a
90:10 - lawyer for the Tolkien estate and you
90:13 - see this don't don't sue me I'll take it
90:18 - down if you want me to
90:43 - all right Patrick said sorry Patrick I
90:45 - didn't see this comment this was a while
90:47 - ago he said I don't think that's a great
90:50 - place for a switch statement
90:54 - so I guess let me know I'm probably not
90:59 - gonna change it right now but let me
91:01 - know where else would you put the switch
91:04 - you know we I guess
91:06 - should I just kind of extract this out
91:09 - of here and then I guess I could make
91:20 - this into a function in return no I
91:23 - wouldn't need to return anything would I
91:24 - because it's already doing what it needs
91:26 - to do anyway let me know where where I
91:34 - should put it in Y and that would be
91:37 - helpful it would be helpful for me and
91:39 - maybe for other people watching as well
92:07 - actually there's there's not really a
92:09 - question made more of a discussion going
92:13 - on about using a using it through the
92:17 - terminal or using a graphical user
92:18 - interface forget so I like github as a
92:22 - git client for the desktop I'm
92:26 - interested I mean what do you all prefer
92:28 - obviously I use the terminal I've never
92:30 - used the the desktop app for github
92:34 - before is it better for some things I
92:42 - tell you what figuring out like merging
92:49 - things I could see how merging might be
92:53 - better with a better interface and
92:56 - definitely trying to do like like you
92:59 - get diff would be potentially easier
93:04 - with a graphical interface but since I
93:09 - already am doing things with the
93:11 - terminal it's just so much easier to do
93:13 - everything in the terminal I think and
93:16 - then once you remember all the commands
93:18 - it's so much faster
93:32 - Patrick says this is the most convoluted
93:35 - use of a switch statement I think I've
93:37 - ever seen impressive thanks Patrick
93:47 - yeah if anyone has ideas to refactor
93:49 - this let me know I'm definitely not we
93:57 - don't have to stick with this it's just
93:59 - the first thing that came into my head
94:00 - to deal with that
94:26 - patrick said i once had to refactor and
94:29 - maintain a pearl cgi shopping cart
94:33 - written by a graphic designer as one
94:35 - giant switch statement haha
94:37 - I would like to see that I would not
94:40 - like to have to maintain that but it
94:42 - would be cool to see it Mitchell says hi
94:48 - guys this is a nice way to learn never
94:50 - thought of live coding hey how's it
94:52 - going not sure if you're still still
94:54 - watching but thanks for watching
95:18 - okay Patrick says don't set state twice
95:22 - and handle scroll combine the scroll y1
95:27 - so I then to put this scroll Y part in
95:32 - here so that set state only runs
95:36 - essentially once each time this is
95:40 - called
95:49 - okay Patrick is saying I build a new
95:52 - object in the switch and then set State
95:55 - at the end with scroll Y included okay
95:59 - that makes sense so I would then only
96:04 - call set State down here and it would
96:08 - include whatever whatever info I need
96:11 - and the scroll Y in an object all right
96:14 - that's that's cool I said I'm not gonna
96:16 - make any changes right now but that does
96:20 - make a lot of sense
96:25 - Patrick asks what am I going to do with
96:27 - the menu on small screens I'm just gonna
96:30 - hide it on small screens I don't really
96:32 - know I can't think of a good way to
96:37 - display that on a really small screen so
96:40 - I was just gonna leave it off if anyone
96:44 - has any ideas for how to display a menu
96:46 - like that so this type of side menu when
96:50 - a screen gets really small let me know
96:53 - but I I don't know I think it would just
96:55 - be better I mean it'll be a lot of
96:58 - scrolling but it would be better to just
97:02 - leave the space for the text I think
97:04 - although what I made when I may have
97:06 - available though is a an arrow maybe to
97:11 - go to get to the top of the page
97:19 - Oh we'll see actually you know what I am
97:23 - gonna try to implement it so that if you
97:25 - scroll up a little bit the header then
97:27 - appears wherever you're at so that that
97:32 - would eliminate the need to put that
97:34 - arrow to scroll away up to the top yeah
97:36 - I think we yeah we had talked about that
97:39 - earlier in the week I think
97:51 - John Hanson said it's amazing so much
97:54 - goes into a small UI function yeah can
97:57 - you believe that I mean I thought about
98:00 - that this morning and like I can't
98:01 - believe I'm still working on this part
98:04 - like it looks so small and that's it's
98:09 - really hard sometimes to people who have
98:13 - no idea of what goes into making
98:14 - something like this would potentially
98:17 - think like oh you just add this little
98:19 - thing you know that's what like an hour
98:21 - less than an hour to do that it seems
98:23 - like a small thing but it's really not
98:26 - so I found that with with clients before
98:29 - with people here at the University that
98:34 - that there's very little understanding
98:38 - of how thing how long things actually
98:40 - take so occasionally someone will ask
98:43 - for something and it immediately be
98:45 - dismissed is all that'll take forever
98:46 - but really it's not a big deal and I can
98:49 - get it done quickly and then other times
98:51 - the last or something that they think is
98:53 - a very small thing and I have to explain
98:56 - like well actually that's that's going
98:58 - to take a long time so anyway I guess
99:05 - that's just how it is I'm sure it's like
99:07 - that with other professions as well
99:09 - unless you really know what goes into
99:11 - something then you won't really have an
99:13 - idea of how long it'll take
99:23 - so we have a question so I started to
99:25 - use Redux recently in the fields that
99:26 - it's very hard to divide components and
99:28 - smart and dumb how do you make it
99:45 - yeah
99:51 - I don't know I guess I don't have I
99:54 - haven't really had
99:56 - so basically smart and dumb components
99:58 - we talk about stateless and stateful
100:00 - components right so components that have
100:02 - state and that needs state and then
100:04 - components that don't I don't know I
100:10 - guess I haven't really had problems in
100:12 - dividing them because it's I mean
100:16 - usually you know if your component needs
100:21 - to do something or change based on user
100:25 - action then it's probably going to need
100:28 - state if we're talking about Redux then
100:37 - most of your state should live in the
100:40 - store and redux right so you shouldn't
100:43 - have this separate component state but I
100:46 - will say if you have components that are
100:49 - really simple like that the state is
100:54 - basically just for UI right so in this
100:57 - case I don't know that I would store the
101:02 - state to make this thing work in this in
101:04 - the store in Redux this would probably
101:06 - be something that I would keep at the
101:08 - component level at component level
101:11 - States I'm not exactly sure if this is
101:12 - what you're asking so hopefully this
101:15 - helps though so this is something where
101:17 - you know this state is not going to need
101:21 - to be known you know by other components
101:25 - right it's not it's not shared right so
101:27 - anytime you have a shared state that
101:29 - more than one component needs to know
101:31 - about that state it should definitely be
101:33 - in the store but like if you have
101:39 - something that only one component needs
101:41 - and especially if it's just like UI
101:45 - related right in this case we're just
101:49 - changing the whole point of pretty much
101:52 - everything that we've done here was just
101:54 - to make this a slightly you know higher
101:59 - font weight so I would keep that
102:05 - at the component state sooner
102:09 - sorry if you have a worth worked on
102:11 - Redux that might not have made very much
102:13 - sense to you sorry about that
102:15 - hopefully the next project we can use
102:17 - Redux and then that'll be a nice if you
102:19 - haven't worked with it'll be a nice
102:20 - introduction if you're just starting out
102:22 - with it then hopefully we can we can
102:24 - learn and get better with it together
102:26 - I John Hansen asks our empty div section
102:38 - main etc wrong thing to build into react
102:41 - components making them are usable when I
102:44 - tried to do this components like figure
102:47 - image figcaption nested inside the above
102:50 - don't show em actually I don't I don't
102:59 - know I am
103:06 - I don't know that I've ever tried to
103:08 - make like empty sections basically
103:11 - layout components right yeah I don't
103:18 - know that I've tried to make that are
103:20 - you using what would it be it would be
103:23 - children so within I would check out two
103:31 - things I would check out maybe two to
103:33 - see so in our last project which is the
103:37 - repo is called CI react or maybe react
103:43 - CI either way there's a layout component
103:51 - that essentially does somewhat of what
103:55 - you're talking about
103:56 - so check out how that's done and then
103:59 - also if you look at the materialize is
104:05 - it materialized no the latest version of
104:12 - material UI so the the very newest
104:14 - version that we attempted to use it
104:16 - first and then decided to switch back I
104:18 - think they have some layout components
104:20 - like that that are just basically empty
104:22 - sections for their grid view I would
104:25 - check that out as well and see how they
104:26 - implement that so I don't think it would
104:31 - be wrong to do that I could definitely
104:32 - see value in that especially if if you
104:35 - want to use them as layout components it
104:38 - almost reminds me of in WordPress they
104:41 - have these shortcodes and they have
104:44 - short codes for layout which normally
104:47 - you would just do with divs but I mean
104:53 - if you've worked with short codes in
104:54 - WordPress you know what I'm talking
104:55 - about but essentially they would serve
104:57 - the same purpose so anyway those two
105:00 - places might be a good place to kind of
105:03 - look into it and see how that's being
105:07 - done in you know in other ways
105:22 - oh cool cough will says West boss has a
105:26 - Redux course and it's free so that's
105:32 - awesome I'm gonna have to check that out
105:34 - like I said I'm learning Redux through
105:36 - the Udacity react nano degree right now
105:39 - but maybe that would be a good resource
105:42 - to use alongside of it and give me a
105:45 - better understanding hey I'm there so
105:54 - congratulations so Umberto who's
105:57 - regularly in the live set says that he
106:02 - just received part one of an interview
106:04 - process for a Java developer position
106:06 - that's awesome good luck with with the
106:11 - whole process and that's that's really
106:16 - good I'm really happy for you definitely
106:18 - let us know how things go
106:46 - okay so so someone I'm I can't read and
106:56 - how to pronounce your name so I'm sorry
106:58 - about this
106:59 - I think I'm assuming that's in Russian
107:07 - let me try to translate I'm going to
107:16 - show you a chance like this I can
107:18 - actually say the right name
107:21 - alright so Google Translate is saying
107:24 - it's a bulat sorry if that's wrong I'm
107:29 - just going by Google Translate so uh so
107:32 - I'm gonna say bulat it says recently I
107:35 - got a job as a react native developer
107:37 - but on the previous job I coded 2d games
107:40 - with phaser j/s how much time and I need
107:42 - to afford to be comfortable with react
107:45 - development I guess it just depends on
107:49 - like how how much time per day can you
107:52 - dedicate to it to learning it how fast
107:55 - of a learner are you you know things
107:57 - like that so it's really hard to say you
108:01 - know it's it's more of an individual
108:03 - thing but I've I think I'm pretty
108:08 - comfortable with react right now I mean
108:10 - I'm comfortable enough that I can create
108:13 - websites that are that are going to be
108:15 - used by clients by the university I'm
108:18 - comfortable enough to live code in react
108:21 - I guess and I think I started my first
108:26 - real react projects last winter so maybe
108:31 - the beginning of winter in 2016 so it
108:37 - hasn't even been a year yet and during
108:40 - that time I haven't dedicated all my
108:42 - time to react either so I've had to work
108:44 - on other things that weren't react so I
108:48 - would say like potentially you know
108:51 - within a few months you know you could
108:53 - start you'd be really comfortable with
108:55 - it but I
108:58 - and it really does depend on your
109:00 - situation and your your capacity to pick
109:04 - up new things all right Patrick says I
109:09 - actually like the switch statement you
109:11 - wrote so thanks Patrick
109:25 - okay so David says the desktop clients
109:31 - for forget are good for seeing the
109:34 - history of a repo especially multiple
109:35 - people are working on it that's cool
109:42 - yeah definitely I didn't even think
109:44 - about that but that's that's definitely
109:45 - I would be useful as well
110:04 - okay here's some ideas for what to do
110:07 - with this with this on a smaller screen
110:10 - so Rowan said could it be a right slide
110:15 - out actually that's that's possible I
110:18 - think I think I remember that doing like
110:26 - a side and that thing like this on this
110:29 - side was very easy just basically you
110:31 - just change a prop and to add another
110:35 - one so yeah that yeah that could
110:41 - definitely work yes I'll think about
110:45 - that also Thomas says we're fixed fixed
110:50 - to the top yeah I could do that too
110:56 - I don't want to really don't want to
110:57 - take up too much space we'll just have
110:59 - to try some things out on mobile like
111:01 - I'm not really actually what I should do
111:06 - I'm gonna check out the analytics right
111:08 - because we're redoing something that's
111:10 - already live I want to check the
111:12 - analytics and see what people are using
111:14 - when they go there if it turns out that
111:16 - there's a very small percentage of
111:18 - people visiting this on their mobile
111:21 - phones then I'll probably just end up
111:24 - completely hiding this if it's a large
111:26 - percentage then maybe I'll you know try
111:28 - out some other ways to mean it to make
111:31 - this work on a small screen but it may
111:34 - not be the best use of our time to
111:37 - really you know do a lot more with this
111:39 - for smaller screens if there's not
111:42 - really many people using the smaller
111:45 - screens probably good to check the
111:48 - analytics anyway and just to see you
111:50 - know perhaps we need to test this on
111:52 - certain browsers that are being used
111:55 - frequently as well
112:19 - Oh awesome so bula says the translation
112:25 - was correct so in it in he is from
112:29 - Russia so cool I'm really glad it's
112:32 - correct and why I'm a little bit nervous
112:33 - Google Translate is normally really good
112:36 - but I'm always a bit nervous that it'll
112:38 - like mess up when somebody's trying to
112:41 - say so so that's cool I'm glad that I'm
112:45 - glad they got it right okay yeah so I
112:50 - think I've got through all the questions
112:52 - now and yeah okay so it's almost four
112:58 - o'clock Eastern Time where I'm at and I
113:02 - really need to get to the post office
113:04 - before they close they close in an hour
113:07 - so now it's a great time to wrap things
113:10 - up thank you so much for all your help
113:13 - in the live chat and and just for
113:16 - watching I really appreciate it I think
113:20 - you know we got this working and I'm
113:23 - happy with the way it's working just
113:25 - needs a bit of styling to look really
113:28 - nice and think I'll be back Monday let
113:37 - me double check
113:43 - just to give you kind of an advanced
113:45 - heads-up if I need yeah it looks like I
113:47 - don't have anything on the calendar for
113:50 - Monday afternoon so unless something
113:54 - else comes up some meeting I should be
113:57 - at the same time I think I do have a
114:00 - meeting at 3:00 that I didn't put on my
114:01 - calendar so it'd probably be a short
114:03 - stream on Monday maybe I might take a
114:09 - day off next week
114:10 - and take my kids to a museum in
114:13 - Pittsburgh but I'm not 100% sure about
114:16 - that because some of my kids have been
114:18 - sick lately so I don't want to take them
114:19 - if they're still sick but anyway I'm
114:24 - sure y'all don't need to know my oh my
114:26 - my life right now but I have a wonderful
114:30 - weekend hope everybody you know has an
114:34 - enjoyable relaxing weekend or if you
114:36 - have to work I hope it's productive for
114:38 - you so I guess I'll see you on Monday
114:43 - thanks again

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and everybody this happened a Good Friday kind of nice end of the week looking forward to to the weekend although I'll still be coding over the weekend I'm sure it's the same with all of you there's always always something to work on today see I want to let you know about a few things before we get started so one really cool code school is having a free weekend so they're courses you go in there and take their courses for free so check that out it's cooked code school comm slash free weekend and thanks to Patrick for putting that in the live chat and in the slack channel for for our live stream so check that out not an official endorsement because I haven't taken courses from code school so I can't say personally whether or not it's a good resource but I checked out some of their courses just the you know the names of of it and I look pretty cool so if you if you don't have anything else going on this weekend then seems like a good opportunity there's one more thing okay I remember I should write this stuff down beforehand so I don't forget I so this is the style guide and I think I've shown this before on live strangers the style guide for the the university that I work for so I made this and this was actually the first react project that I ever worked on the reason that I bring this up now is because I had a comment on a one of my videos and someone had said they found a typo in the style guide and they they were going to submit a pull request to fix it but they couldn't find the repo and I thought that was odd and I thought well maybe I made it private it turns out I did so I made that repo private I'm not sure why but I suspect since it was my first react project I didn't want to look like a noob so I just made it private so now that I'm live on YouTube looking like a noob every day I decided there's no reason that it should be private so I did make it public so that repo is now public on you can find it on my github account which I don't know if I have that linked or not it's linked from my YouTube channel which i think is like linked in the video but anyway if you're interested you can check it out I wouldn't really spend too much time doing if you wanted like let's say to contribute I wouldn't spend too much time on this one because after looking at the code I think I'd really like to redo it and and redo it to the point of maybe it's better just to start a completely new project this was done using create react app but I ejected it really you know really soon into it was maybe like the third or fourth commit said I ran eject and I think I was just curious and wanted to do some things with the setup I wanted to use sass so and at the time I couldn't figure out how to get sass to work without ejecting so anyway it probably has really old versions of everything all the the packages and things are old and it's using materialized and not material UI and I think I'd rather go with material UI if I'm doing things in react so anyway just thought I'd let you know since there was some interest in in the style guide I didn't realize anybody was looking at it but I guess at least one person was alright so I'm gonna say hi and check the lab chat really quick okay cool Patrick says he's done some previous free weekends on with code school and he said it's a pretty good resource so awesome okay so let's get started I do want to say my normal type of kind of thing for any new people that are watching or maybe you've only watched a few times and haven't heard this before the point of this stream in particular is to just show me in doing my everyday work as a frontend developer I'm employed fulltime by University and so it's not necessarily a tutorial but I try to explain what I'm doing as much as possible so if you're a beginner then it might still be worthwhile for you to watch even if this is maybe a little bit more advanced than than what you're currently doing because I'll you know I try to explain things and also you know not everything is done during the stream so from stream to stream there may be things that I work on are things that change that obviously I didn't get you know recorded there will be interruptions occasionally people knock on my door they call me and I have to stop so just wanted to get that all out of the way right off the bat if you've been watching for a while I know you know that but occasionally I do have people that are I don't know it seems like maybe from the comments that that they don't they've never heard that before or realized with what I'm doing with this stream so I just want to make sure when expectations are correct with what we're trying to do here alright so having said all that I actually have changed very little since yesterday and in fact Patrick submitted a pull request and basically I don't I don't know that I want to say fix the issues we were having with with standard KS yesterday but I guess kind of worked around it all right and here's the workaround so you can see it in two places first place is here at the top of our file we can set some some es Lin rules and in this case we're setting the global onmouseover on Mouse outs right so this would these were we're giving us errors saying they're not defined now there's no errors and then also we can do that in our package JSON so you can see under standard Global's we put all these things one of them being state so when we were defining state and let's see what we're doing it okay when we're defining state like this we were getting an undefined error so now we don't get that anymore and going forward for anybody submitting pool requests I think the best way to proceed with this is if you if you use something here with especially if you use it you know like this with the arrow function it's it's not going to it's not gonna recognize that right forward for a lot of reasons that we went over yesterday and I'm not gonna go into because I'm not exactly I'm not even exactly sure what the reasons are but it has something to do with updates to yarn NPM so what we will do then is in our global up here within the file so not in package JSON we're gonna put everything that's giving that's giving us errors or that we know ahead of time we'll probably give us errors this avoids us having to bind so normally we would bind these things we bind this for each one of these in our constructor right so for every single click for onmouseover for onmouseout that would be two separate lines so we still have to do something but it's it's less than what we normally have to do and it's way up at the top and it's not down here you know kind of clutter things up so we can basically do it all in one line and just throw it up here it'll work if you're going to use something on more than one component then it can go here in our package JSON so that's the that's kind of the workaround for now thanks Patrick for for doing that that was really good thinking actually because that's I mean it's just a very simple solution and this is certainly a debatable thing so I don't want to put this forward it's like this is the solution that everybody should use because it's there certainly might be a different way or better way to get these working without errors and it's debatable as to whether or not this is even the best way to do things you know the older way of using the constructor is still in the react documentation binding with this inside the constructor is in the react documentation it does mention this property initializer syntax but it does it says that it's experimental so this is certainly not the standard way I like it I've been doing it that way for the last at least the last two projects I think including this one and so I've gotten used to it I like it it's more concise and I don't have a problem telling you know being able to know what's going on I have read you know online some people saying that they're not sure you know what's going on when they see that but I don't know I think it's pretty straightforward so I'd like to keep using that but I certainly understand it let's say if you were to submit a pull request using the older way of doing things I'm not opposed to that I'm not gonna say that you need to change it so with with that said we're gonna move forward when I do things you know I'll do it with the property initializer syntax but I just stuff I definitely don't want to put that forward like this is the way to do it because I don't think that that's at least from what I've researched it's it's certainly not a decided issue yet okay so actually I just got a link from so then put a link in about this buying issue so I'm gonna I'm gonna open that up on my other screen so I don't forget but I'm not gonna go over it right now because I've already talked for a long time without doing any coding so I'd like to get started on the coding but thank you Ben I will check that out as soon as I'm done with with the stream and what we were working on yesterday so just to catch everyone up we're building great with react we use create react app and we've got a bunch of other kind of nice tools that we're working with to autoformat our code and so the basic function of what we're building is to provide resources like logo images and information to people who work at this university that I work at and also allow them through a form to submit requests for work so we're working today on this section and so yesterday we we set some things up to be able to attract the scroll position of the user on the page and to also get the values of the Y position of each of these these are all h3s that I'm highlighting each of these age threes the plan today is to change this side menu here to reflect the names of these headers and to have as we scroll down have the appropriate name be highlighted okay and not only that but we'd like it if if you happen to click on one of those names that it would scroll automatically to that section okay so we're gonna be adapting this this component comes in material UI and I think it's called pepper immaterial UI so it's not exactly intended for this kind of thing but it's close enough that I think we can adapt it pretty pretty easily I don't think it'll take too much work to do this so that's where we're at that's what's what's going on so if you want to follow along in the repo we're in the planning guide Jas is where we'll be at for probably all of this maybe we'll put some styles in a sass file but other than that we're gonna be hanging out in this file so I'm gonna close our folder tree view and just give us some more space I'll make this a bit bigger for you all let's see so we need see I need I need to get my mind wrapped around where we left off I had meetings all morning and so I didn't I didn't get a chance to work on this okay all right so currently our header positions are here in an array and then our scroll position is here under scroll Y so let's change let's change the values here for this step or just to make it a bit more obvious with the what this is supposed to do I keep having to explain what it's going to do because we still have all these default things here so let's change that and for now I think I'm just going to I'm just gonna manually put put the sections in I think if we had more sections it would be a better idea to grab the text of each h3 and then loop over let's say we had an array of the text for each of the h3 s loop over that and then create these but since we only have what three or four I'm just gonna put them in here and all right I'll just copy and paste these actually this will be faster let me drag this over on my other screen and it'll be a lot faster for me to copy and paste that I may shorten some of these up we'll see how how they display but I'd rather not have them wrap onto another line so we'll see if that's necessary and we need to add few more just one more right there's only four and let's give this a step index of three and they should be two three yes if he should be three as well all right see how that looks oops okay that's actually and not bad now that I look at this I think it's worded a bit I don't like how it's worded right so it says please follow these guidelines and so it says plan ahead proof the job in a timely manner so those are like saying here's what you do right you have to plan ahead you have to prove drove in a timely manner and then this just says budget information I think it might be better if it just said budget right like you need to budget and then obviously this is information about budgeting normally I don't make decisions about content we have content editors that just tell me what to do but I think I'm gonna change that and we'll just see how it goes they'll definitely make me change it back they don't like that budget following that same logic services would probably go better up here's a planet and I guess would be better if it's a plan ahead to services budget proof the job in a timely manner maybe services could go after budget I'm gonna leave it alone for now oh this is not really my area I'll let the content people deal with that but now that we kind of after we had it kind of displayed over here it just it looks looked a little odd to me I think we can I think we can get rid of this one two three four I mean the steps are somewhat logical but right now at least the position of services throws things off a bit a bit because that's obviously not the last step so we're going to remove this reset and we're gonna remove this click a step and then I guess we'll remove these as well so you don't need yeah this entire paragraph we can get rid of and you know if you get rid of this yeah hopefully this won't break things and I think we don't need these buttons anymore not okay great so we have gotten rid of that good okay so it's still doing some things that we don't really want it to do but we'll get we got something through many a oops forgot to set my Pomodoro timer it's so let's set it now better late than never so we may need to let's check out the options in material UI if there's not an option to change how this looks then we can always just use some CSS to override things I'd rather not directly modify the component in material UI so I think it would be better in this case to just change essentially just hide this with CSS assuming that there's no option and we need okay it looks like we we may be able to put whatever we want inside the step okay so right now we're using this step button which I'm assuming that's that's what's giving us our this kind of circle with the checkbox there so if we changed it and we didn't use a step button but instead I mean we replace this with anything really if we leave the on click the unclick yeah I don't think we'll be changing state yeah I don't think will change state well we want to do unclick you scroll to a certain position yeah so let's just first let's try changing this let's just make it a span for now just see what it what it looks like all right cool so let's change all of these two spans see how that looks whoa all right still want to get rid of these but okay not that we want to add add some styling to that but we've gotten rid of the other thing so okay I want to see how this looks now in the and he's you know okay I'm gonna try let me make sure I'm gonna make this a bit smaller so we can see both both things I believe we can scroll was it no let's just be honored right no this whole table is not a function hmm I thought we'd use this we'll use okay so that's just giving us our let's try with window oh we need sorry let's try that again I remember how to do it now there we go okay so we can do this and it'll scroll us around so if you saw that I'm just typing in different values for scroll top I'm setting scroll top to whatever I want it to be okay so that's that's how we do it you'd see I was a little confused at first and I was trying to set it in here and dev tools kept telling me that it wasn't a function and it just didn't register at first okay so first we're gonna do it like this a nicer way to do this would be to gradually scroll so maybe we'll implement some sort of smooth scrolling I have done that on previous projects it's possible I use jQuery for it but it I think it would be worthwhile for me to look up how I did it before and see if I could just adapt that so here's what we want to do on click me grab this so on click we want to see you want to go scroll top equals this set or this state and let's go with call that header physicians okay so to go this state header positions and header positions and we can actually use the step index right we have we do have the step in ducks here correct yeah so we can use the step index no we can't because I'm not setting the step index anymore all right I may have to rethink I'm doing this for now I'm just gonna manually put a few of these in and that'll at least be able to test the next step okay let's see cool alright so this is working it's taking us to the sections gray awesome okay so that's I think that was actually the second step as I explained it before but that ended up being easier to implement so one of the things that we wanted to do is implement it and the next thing is just going to be to highlight this if we're in that the right area you know kind of so as we scroll down and that highlight whether or not something is highlighted will be determined by our Y our scroll Y and our header positions so let's see so I think we should give position of active section and let's see zero so we'll use the index of each section I think that that we yeah that should be the easiest way so section 1 which would be 0 right because we're zero indexing section 1 will be the default because that's just going to be the top of the page basically the top we're not including that first h2 but this will work so active section is 0 so let's see all right let me let me just kind of explain out loud what I'm thinking for the next step so we will make the active the active section will be based on a comparison between the scroll Y and the header positions that comparison will happen every time handle scroll runs will do that same comparison so I suppose inside handle scroll will do that will it'll be something like like a note like this set state but it'll be maybe a switch statement that may be the best way to do it because there's going to be conditions so if scroll Y is between certain values then that's going to change it will change the state here for our active section so then for each one of these we're gonna have to have some sort of check to say if the active section corresponds to this this section that's represented by by these labels then we're gonna want to make it bold or something I actually haven't even decided with the what the indicator is going to be does that make sense okay I know there's a delay so give everybody like 30 seconds to respond I don't want to lose anyone so let me know if it doesn't make sense but that's what we'll be working on okay Patrick I just I saw your comment about the the warning so at 31st he is like okay cool so Patrick's saying that these these that he put the first line that he put up here was to take care of the areas that I'm seeing in the console step but mr. fun I'm just gonna clean things up a bit and then I'll check the live chat before we go move on now that I look at this I think we're we're really not using very much of the functionality at all of this stepper essentially it's just providing us with just kind of the layout of a list of things vertically so I guess we didn't really need to use the separ we'll see once we're finished with it once we're finished with that we may be able to just switch these over to divs or a maybe a ul and it would probably work especially since we have this we have some of the styles here too guess we don't need the back button there Styles action I don't think we even have the actions anymore I'm not sure what part was the content let's see okay yeah that's the list here that works this is drops oh here we go forgot to take this one up hmm who did yeah we're definitely not even really using most of what's going on with this with this stepper so let's just get rid of this okay and still there we go you will see I'm just was trying to get rid of some of these errors these crops from the element planting I had one of four I thought I removed all of those I can't find them well maybe now might be the best time to just switch this over from this step to ul yes yeah I think that'll be the way to go so let's get rid of this I mean why why import you know this component if we're not even really using it so I mean this was kind of useful just to help frame how we were going to think about this but now it's pretty obvious that this is not going to be necessary okay and that should take care of great so you took care of those little lines which is pretty awesome so we'll need to add a little bit of padding and everything but much better we're gonna get rid of Stefan stuff here define I've never used yeah there we go get rid of that okay so now get rid of those error messages and the click yeah so this still works so everything that we've done with clicking still works great all right I said I was going to check the live chat quickly so I'm gonna do that now yeah so let me just check the live chat now since I started this timer late anyway so we're gonna do the five minutes if you're not familiar with with this stream and haven't seen it before we do Pomodoro's timer so 25 minutes of coding five minutes I check the live chat we do that maybe two or three times and then we finish up and the last part of the stream is just cue a questionandanswer see so I'm just gonna scroll up a bit and see what I missed so someone asked if angularjs is worth learning I just say it depends on what would you want to learn if you're interested in that if there's jobs if at a certain company you know that uses angular then it's definitely worth learning depends also you know how much time you have if you have a lot of time you know go ahead and and learn it you know you could learn it without even really having a good reason to yeah but it just definitely depends on what you're what you're trying to do Blake also at Blake asked brackets i over PSA's vs code it's a Visual Studio code so I don't know I've never used brackets so I can't really compare I have used Visual Studio code and I like it but like I said since I haven't used brackets I can't really answer that question braxton says hey Jessie how's it going I'm doing all right huh how's everything going with you thanks for watching okay Rohan has a good question Rohan says I know you have a job currently but if you were to change jobs or go freelance again would you advertise yourself as a reactive or frontend slash fullstack yeah I wonder I I guess I would feel comfortable at this point calling myself a reactive that's not to say I think I'm an expert at react but I've been developing sites you'll react sites for a while so I would do that I'm deaf obviously I'm comfortable with frontend I don't know about full stack I'm getting more confident at at doing things other than frontend so I don't know I'd have to do a little bit more with backend before I be comfortable saying full stack but I don't think I'm that far away from from being able to say that honestly so maybe I guess it would just depend on what what I really wanted to do if I read if I knew I really wanted to do react which at this point I I really like react so I may end up just saying reactive yeah I may I may do react because I I would like that and then just for the type of company react is is somewhat new so I would know that if there is a company that is using react and they're looking specifically for react dev the odds of them being open to adopting new things like sooner are probably greater than a company that is just looking for a front end of and you know who knows they could be using you know in anything so I guess it would for me at least I'd like to have a job where I'm you know I'm somewhere the comfortable trying new things and trying to stay you know as cutting edge as is reasonable so I guess the answer the question right now after I've thought about it is I think I would market myself as a react dev okay then I just saw your comments about the material UI components and all the props so I mean I guess at this point it doesn't matter but thank you for for letting me know about that break point asks why are you implementing scroll instead of the anchor we're doing the scroll well basically it's easy to get it so my times up here so let me let me start this again but this is a good segue back into the code so the the reason I went with the scroll instead of the anchor so I originally I was planning on doing the anchor and I think I had yeah so I even added in IDs thinking that I would go with the anchor but I really don't need the idea is now because we end up going with this index and since we've indexed the positions the header positions here then when we click on these it's easier just to go by the index I I think it's easier just go by the index at this point especially if we were to let's say like create these dynamically okay so that's one reason is it was just easier when I was doing this to say like okay we have the value stored in an array so let's just go with the index the second reason though is if I want to implement some sort of smooth scrolling feature I know I don't know like I said I need to go back and look at how I've done this in the past but I think it will be easier to implement by the position because I believe what I've done in the past is gotten the ID determine what the position was and then set up scrolling based on the position anyway so and in that scenario it wouldn't really matter you know we wouldn't be using the anchor to navigate so does that make sense I mean maybe I'm thinking about this wrong and you know maybe it'll be clearer later on for me but probably what will end up happening is I'll I'll have some sort of like smooth scrolling happen and it'll be more beneficial for me to know the position anyway okay I was just checking the the last little bit there and in the latch at okay so I didn't get through everything so I'll come back after this Pomodoro session and I'll start back you know right with the comments right after we talked about using the anchor so so any comments made after 226 p.m. Eastern Time I will get to those in about 20 minutes all right so let's move on I really think we can get this working before we finish so that's the goal today I'm not worried about having its style 100% properly but at least having it functional I think it's a good goal and it's definitely reasonable okay so let's do our we're gonna do this on handle scroll right now I want to do this on handle scroll because it's being throttled right so we're tracking the scroll we have our event listener but we're only calling handle scroll every you know 200 milliseconds so this is where we want it let's do all right let's do a switch statement I'm gonna have to look up on my other screen how to do a switch statement because I have not typed out a switch statement in a long time I remember when I was first learning how to do a switch statement I made a textbased game and depending on how you answered the questions it did different things and it was just one big switch statement I think it's on my github yeah I think I did put it on github it was like a Lord of the Rings kind of game and I think it used alerts yeah so it's probably I haven't looked at it in years it's probably pretty terrible but the whole point was for me to learn how to use a switch statement all right so on my other screen I just opened up the ND mdn page on switch statements and I'm just gonna paste in there example to say sometime alright great so the switch statement is we're gonna pass in the scroll wide yeah we're gonna pass in scroll why scroll why and then the first case is going to be I see you scroll I actually let me see this I guess it would be oops yeah we won't even really need the first value at all since the top of the page who have it highlighted so we'll just skip right to the neck the second value so if wait a second I need to read let me take five seconds to read about switch statements because like totally just drawing a blank with how to do a switch statement so what I want to do basically is something like if the first case will be is if scroll Scroll Y is less than now yeah if scroll Y is greater than header this state header physicians one they were it okay so you know I'm trying to do okay let me try it like this okay this is how I think it would work all right so for the switch I want it to match true right so if this is true then it's gonna do what's in here right does that make that makes more sense we'll find out in a few seconds so for now why did they put these brakes let me get rid of these or at least that's and I do want this default so one oops to let's see this is greater than let's see I think I'm doing this backwards from what it should be so what I should ever do is if it's less than the first position then it's going to be header one there we go if it's less than the second then it's going to be oh yeah header header two three and then this last case will be for three do you think suppose someone lets everyone listen to all right let's try this out what did I do all right so let's see what we get okay cool so four three two one alright so normally if someone would start at the top of the page there at the top of the page let's see as we go down having one that's cool 1 1 1 1 1 now we switch to 2 right there perfect yeah that's where we want to switch and now 3 and finally 4 all right cool so that works just like we want it to work now we just need to switch it out instead of consult logging we need to highlight one of these depending on where we're at on the page so let's do that so I think it's the best way to do this I think if I can put I do this I don't think I can I was trying to put a ternary in style but I'm pretty sure you can't do that can you put one inside an element let's see I don't know if I've ever tried this before let's just try it and see what happens so actually see we want step content I don't think we need this anymore right yeah let's get rid of that I didn't realize I already had a switch statement on the page that would have would have simplified things okay so let's do something here so active okay I already have active section okay cool so actually to test this all I need to do is is active section see if I can do this I don't think this is gonna work but let's see we let's see now I knew I'd get in there alright let's see let's check the live chat really quick alright nothing in there okay so good to know we can't do this we can't do this so let's see at least I can see if I like the font weight all right so that's that's not I think at least can see the difference in it I do it here actually this is toship this is an object if I could do it in here I don't think this will work either this would be the last silly thing I tried that Oh needs to be this state active section whoa did that really work actually so it kind of worked let me try it on another one okay yeah it doesn't work what I was trying to do was check to see if the active section equal zero then oh yeah wait a second maybe it did work and I just I just did it wrong okay cool so that like I said it kind of works because it doesn't update see should I do this let's see all right so what uh what I'm trying to do which was probably obvious is I want to change the font weight based on where we're at on the page Oh have I not changed active section yet yeah oh all right that was silly I haven't actually changed that to section so this is this sad state this may end up working this one too so right now there are a lot of things hardcoded in here that could probably be done in a more automatically I guess but for now it's this works oh look at that it worked a little bit I didn't put it on the other ones yet all right so check that out we have the highlighting its changing awesome let's put that on these other guys alright so cool so this is really good to know I hope I remember this next time I try it because I know I've done this before and went through the same thing if you're trying to apply a certain style to an element in line if you try to put the entire style object you know inside this ternary it does not work but if you inside that object since this is just JavaScript anyway for the value and the key value pair if you put the ternary there then it works so if you're not familiar with this this is like I don't what they call it one of you are the one that that showed me how to do this it may have been Patrick and I think you call it like a shortcircuit or something like that so basically it's like we're checking to see if this if the active section is equal to zero instead of putting you know let's say the question mark and then 500 and then a colon and putting out of the default font weight value there we can just say we just put this in here basically and then so whatever happens after that is just gonna happen you know automatically if this is true and if it's false nothing happens right because if it's false it's it doesn't go any further right so anyway so it's just a little shortcut so let's put these here and here and two three I just got the feeling like I recreated a lot of what that stepper already did but oh well it works cool and see see so this is working oh no I don't know if you saw that so if I click on one the other ones still highlighted I think what we need to do in our switch statement then is put equal to less than or equal to for all these and that should fix it so let's double check I know it doesn't if we move down just a bit hmm less than equal to oh no now we don't need me equal to let's see and position listen I think if I had just adjusted like this let's see there we go so that was enough so if we just adjusted it so it's one pixel less than that that solved the problem because when we click it is taking us exactly to where that is so there we go all right awesome and that was pretty good timing because this just beeped about a minute ago so I'm gonna do the five minutes let me check the time actually I might I might wrap things up now and just check the live chat do a little question answer now because we basically accomplished what we wanted to for this I'm obviously not gonna leave it like this style wise so I'm gonna get rid of these these discs the bullet points I'm gonna get rid of I'm gonna make these let's see if that font size I think this could do with a bit bigger font size obviously some better spacing between these and maybe maybe something more pronounced here to show what section you're on I'm thinking like possibly a a very small left border that moves as we go up and down and that would that border could be our accent our current accent color which is this yellow yeah I think that'll that'll look look a lot better also we're gonna want to set our cursor to pointer when it goes over these just to give a visual indication that this these are clickable all right yeah that's that sounds like that'll that'll look good so I'll probably work on that maybe before I leave actually I've been meaning to stop at the post office for like a week or two and I never get out of work in enough time before the post office closes so I may be leaving a bit early earlier than normal to be able to make it to the post office so if I don't get this to this today than Monday morning I'll make those changes so the code portion of this stream is done so if you just wanted to stick around for the code now that was a good time to to leave and totally understand if you got some other stuff you need to do thank you so much for watching I'll be back on Monday if you can stick around for the question and answer that would be great even if you don't have a question I'd really like your input and a live chat to help answer some some of the questions that we get so so right now I'm gonna scroll back up to where we left off at so if you have any questions put them in the live chat quickly because once I get to the bottom we'll wrap things up and in the stream if you can't stick around to hear the answer to your question you can check out the replay of this this video the recording and that will be available on the free code camp Channel you could also send me a message on Twitter or any other social media platform that you like and I'll try to answer your question there as soon as I get a chance okay okay I think I found where I left off at and I'm not going to read out everything in the live chat but the questions especially questions from from people who are new I definitely want to try to get to those questions and make sure everyone feels welcome okay Blake said Blake it asks a question about bracket zero versus Visual Studio code and he says brackets tayo does not work with github repos so string did do you mean that it doesn't have and it doesn't reflect any of the the state of of get like visually in there I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that so I guess let me know I probably won't be switching editors but it would be good to know maybe especially if there's other people watching that may be considering it dinesh asks is Redux mandatory and been been said no but it is recommended it's pretty standard pattern for react yeah for sure I've I've actually I'm building a react project with Redux right now and it's it's just like a react blog you can post you new blog posts and comment and vote on comments and on posts and I'm doing that for the Udacity react nano degree I'm using Redux for that but I've actually never used Redux for any of my other react projects so yeah it's definitely not mandatory but now that I'm learning it I can see that it would give you a big advantage and keeping keeping track of especially if you had a bigger project things could get things get a little bit crazy with trying to pass state down through so many child components yeah it would Redux makes things a lot easier to reason about so anyway I definitely recommend it unless unless you're doing a really small project then you probably don't need Redux but otherwise it's probably good idea to use Redux or I mean there are other alternatives to Redux too that you could use Jess Quran asks which is the best channel to keep yourself updated related to web then says these videos are using pretty uptodate stuff and level up I don't know I always don't know how people pronounce this but I always say level up Tut's so UTS but he says it's it's a good it's also good for some of the newer things cool yeah I mean I would I I try to do newer stuff when I can I mean I don't I don't use new stuff just to use it because it's new and if it has to be of some value to the project but I real I tried to do something new on every project that I that I use so even if you know most of my projects are probably gonna be react there's some things that I may need to work on where I can't use react because of I have to work it within an existing system but I am gonna try to use some new technology that I've never used before so I guess I guess you know Ben's right this will normally be pretty uptodate looks like there's there's some decent discussion on the merits of Visual Studio code versus brackets okay and it looks like I've got some a clearer picture so what Blake was meaning by github and and brackets is the git integration is is not great so it evidently it breaks live reload if you using it so like I said I don't know I don't use it so I'm not I'm not exactly sure but anybody anybody that uses brackets maybe if you could help out in the live set or in the comments to this video and see if you had any trouble using get with the live preview if so have you found anywhere to work around that or get get it to work Rowland earlier I commented on a on a JavaScript textbased game that I had made that was I was trying to learn how to do switch statements and I mentioned that I used JavaScript alerts for it and Rohan says JavaScript alerts used and loved by scammers and learner's alike indeed yes I really want to go back and play that game now I I think I actually have either a code pen or something on jsfiddle I'm gonna have to go back and look at that that repo because now now I'm just curious it's always it's fun to look at previous projects and just kind of see just like whoa see what you were thinking or how far you've come here it is I'm moving it onto the screen right now I'm just gonna show you oh so you can see look how simple it is one javascript file and to read me at least I put in a readme that I mean that's pretty good this was probably one of the first things I ever used github for let's see the sewers okay yeah so you can see this big switch switch statement yeah defeated you are cool so anyway actually it's not as big as I thought it seemed really big at the time so that's my JavaScript game I should have saved that for like Thursday I could have done throwback Thursday or that project but anyway yeah feel free to play that whenever you want it's super fun you can you can get through all the game content in less than a minute if anyone who is a lawyer for the Tolkien estate and you see this don't don't sue me I'll take it down if you want me to all right Patrick said sorry Patrick I didn't see this comment this was a while ago he said I don't think that's a great place for a switch statement so I guess let me know I'm probably not gonna change it right now but let me know where else would you put the switch you know we I guess should I just kind of extract this out of here and then I guess I could make this into a function in return no I wouldn't need to return anything would I because it's already doing what it needs to do anyway let me know where where I should put it in Y and that would be helpful it would be helpful for me and maybe for other people watching as well actually there's there's not really a question made more of a discussion going on about using a using it through the terminal or using a graphical user interface forget so I like github as a git client for the desktop I'm interested I mean what do you all prefer obviously I use the terminal I've never used the the desktop app for github before is it better for some things I tell you what figuring out like merging things I could see how merging might be better with a better interface and definitely trying to do like like you get diff would be potentially easier with a graphical interface but since I already am doing things with the terminal it's just so much easier to do everything in the terminal I think and then once you remember all the commands it's so much faster Patrick says this is the most convoluted use of a switch statement I think I've ever seen impressive thanks Patrick yeah if anyone has ideas to refactor this let me know I'm definitely not we don't have to stick with this it's just the first thing that came into my head to deal with that patrick said i once had to refactor and maintain a pearl cgi shopping cart written by a graphic designer as one giant switch statement haha I would like to see that I would not like to have to maintain that but it would be cool to see it Mitchell says hi guys this is a nice way to learn never thought of live coding hey how's it going not sure if you're still still watching but thanks for watching okay Patrick says don't set state twice and handle scroll combine the scroll y1 so I then to put this scroll Y part in here so that set state only runs essentially once each time this is called okay Patrick is saying I build a new object in the switch and then set State at the end with scroll Y included okay that makes sense so I would then only call set State down here and it would include whatever whatever info I need and the scroll Y in an object all right that's that's cool I said I'm not gonna make any changes right now but that does make a lot of sense Patrick asks what am I going to do with the menu on small screens I'm just gonna hide it on small screens I don't really know I can't think of a good way to display that on a really small screen so I was just gonna leave it off if anyone has any ideas for how to display a menu like that so this type of side menu when a screen gets really small let me know but I I don't know I think it would just be better I mean it'll be a lot of scrolling but it would be better to just leave the space for the text I think although what I made when I may have available though is a an arrow maybe to go to get to the top of the page Oh we'll see actually you know what I am gonna try to implement it so that if you scroll up a little bit the header then appears wherever you're at so that that would eliminate the need to put that arrow to scroll away up to the top yeah I think we yeah we had talked about that earlier in the week I think John Hanson said it's amazing so much goes into a small UI function yeah can you believe that I mean I thought about that this morning and like I can't believe I'm still working on this part like it looks so small and that's it's really hard sometimes to people who have no idea of what goes into making something like this would potentially think like oh you just add this little thing you know that's what like an hour less than an hour to do that it seems like a small thing but it's really not so I found that with with clients before with people here at the University that that there's very little understanding of how thing how long things actually take so occasionally someone will ask for something and it immediately be dismissed is all that'll take forever but really it's not a big deal and I can get it done quickly and then other times the last or something that they think is a very small thing and I have to explain like well actually that's that's going to take a long time so anyway I guess that's just how it is I'm sure it's like that with other professions as well unless you really know what goes into something then you won't really have an idea of how long it'll take so we have a question so I started to use Redux recently in the fields that it's very hard to divide components and smart and dumb how do you make it yeah I don't know I guess I don't have I haven't really had so basically smart and dumb components we talk about stateless and stateful components right so components that have state and that needs state and then components that don't I don't know I guess I haven't really had problems in dividing them because it's I mean usually you know if your component needs to do something or change based on user action then it's probably going to need state if we're talking about Redux then most of your state should live in the store and redux right so you shouldn't have this separate component state but I will say if you have components that are really simple like that the state is basically just for UI right so in this case I don't know that I would store the state to make this thing work in this in the store in Redux this would probably be something that I would keep at the component level at component level States I'm not exactly sure if this is what you're asking so hopefully this helps though so this is something where you know this state is not going to need to be known you know by other components right it's not it's not shared right so anytime you have a shared state that more than one component needs to know about that state it should definitely be in the store but like if you have something that only one component needs and especially if it's just like UI related right in this case we're just changing the whole point of pretty much everything that we've done here was just to make this a slightly you know higher font weight so I would keep that at the component state sooner sorry if you have a worth worked on Redux that might not have made very much sense to you sorry about that hopefully the next project we can use Redux and then that'll be a nice if you haven't worked with it'll be a nice introduction if you're just starting out with it then hopefully we can we can learn and get better with it together I John Hansen asks our empty div section main etc wrong thing to build into react components making them are usable when I tried to do this components like figure image figcaption nested inside the above don't show em actually I don't I don't know I am I don't know that I've ever tried to make like empty sections basically layout components right yeah I don't know that I've tried to make that are you using what would it be it would be children so within I would check out two things I would check out maybe two to see so in our last project which is the repo is called CI react or maybe react CI either way there's a layout component that essentially does somewhat of what you're talking about so check out how that's done and then also if you look at the materialize is it materialized no the latest version of material UI so the the very newest version that we attempted to use it first and then decided to switch back I think they have some layout components like that that are just basically empty sections for their grid view I would check that out as well and see how they implement that so I don't think it would be wrong to do that I could definitely see value in that especially if if you want to use them as layout components it almost reminds me of in WordPress they have these shortcodes and they have short codes for layout which normally you would just do with divs but I mean if you've worked with short codes in WordPress you know what I'm talking about but essentially they would serve the same purpose so anyway those two places might be a good place to kind of look into it and see how that's being done in you know in other ways oh cool cough will says West boss has a Redux course and it's free so that's awesome I'm gonna have to check that out like I said I'm learning Redux through the Udacity react nano degree right now but maybe that would be a good resource to use alongside of it and give me a better understanding hey I'm there so congratulations so Umberto who's regularly in the live set says that he just received part one of an interview process for a Java developer position that's awesome good luck with with the whole process and that's that's really good I'm really happy for you definitely let us know how things go okay so so someone I'm I can't read and how to pronounce your name so I'm sorry about this I think I'm assuming that's in Russian let me try to translate I'm going to show you a chance like this I can actually say the right name alright so Google Translate is saying it's a bulat sorry if that's wrong I'm just going by Google Translate so uh so I'm gonna say bulat it says recently I got a job as a react native developer but on the previous job I coded 2d games with phaser j/s how much time and I need to afford to be comfortable with react development I guess it just depends on like how how much time per day can you dedicate to it to learning it how fast of a learner are you you know things like that so it's really hard to say you know it's it's more of an individual thing but I've I think I'm pretty comfortable with react right now I mean I'm comfortable enough that I can create websites that are that are going to be used by clients by the university I'm comfortable enough to live code in react I guess and I think I started my first real react projects last winter so maybe the beginning of winter in 2016 so it hasn't even been a year yet and during that time I haven't dedicated all my time to react either so I've had to work on other things that weren't react so I would say like potentially you know within a few months you know you could start you'd be really comfortable with it but I and it really does depend on your situation and your your capacity to pick up new things all right Patrick says I actually like the switch statement you wrote so thanks Patrick okay so David says the desktop clients for forget are good for seeing the history of a repo especially multiple people are working on it that's cool yeah definitely I didn't even think about that but that's that's definitely I would be useful as well okay here's some ideas for what to do with this with this on a smaller screen so Rowan said could it be a right slide out actually that's that's possible I think I think I remember that doing like a side and that thing like this on this side was very easy just basically you just change a prop and to add another one so yeah that yeah that could definitely work yes I'll think about that also Thomas says we're fixed fixed to the top yeah I could do that too I don't want to really don't want to take up too much space we'll just have to try some things out on mobile like I'm not really actually what I should do I'm gonna check out the analytics right because we're redoing something that's already live I want to check the analytics and see what people are using when they go there if it turns out that there's a very small percentage of people visiting this on their mobile phones then I'll probably just end up completely hiding this if it's a large percentage then maybe I'll you know try out some other ways to mean it to make this work on a small screen but it may not be the best use of our time to really you know do a lot more with this for smaller screens if there's not really many people using the smaller screens probably good to check the analytics anyway and just to see you know perhaps we need to test this on certain browsers that are being used frequently as well Oh awesome so bula says the translation was correct so in it in he is from Russia so cool I'm really glad it's correct and why I'm a little bit nervous Google Translate is normally really good but I'm always a bit nervous that it'll like mess up when somebody's trying to say so so that's cool I'm glad that I'm glad they got it right okay yeah so I think I've got through all the questions now and yeah okay so it's almost four o'clock Eastern Time where I'm at and I really need to get to the post office before they close they close in an hour so now it's a great time to wrap things up thank you so much for all your help in the live chat and and just for watching I really appreciate it I think you know we got this working and I'm happy with the way it's working just needs a bit of styling to look really nice and think I'll be back Monday let me double check just to give you kind of an advanced headsup if I need yeah it looks like I don't have anything on the calendar for Monday afternoon so unless something else comes up some meeting I should be at the same time I think I do have a meeting at 300 that I didn't put on my calendar so it'd probably be a short stream on Monday maybe I might take a day off next week and take my kids to a museum in Pittsburgh but I'm not 100% sure about that because some of my kids have been sick lately so I don't want to take them if they're still sick but anyway I'm sure y'all don't need to know my oh my my life right now but I have a wonderful weekend hope everybody you know has an enjoyable relaxing weekend or if you have to work I hope it's productive for you so I guess I'll see you on Monday thanks again
