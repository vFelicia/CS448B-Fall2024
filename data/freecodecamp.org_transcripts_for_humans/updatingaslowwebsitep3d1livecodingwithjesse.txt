00:12 - hey everybody is Jessie today we're
00:15 - gonna start on an entirely new project
00:18 - so we're we may not be finished with the
00:22 - last project we might come back to it
00:24 - but right now there's just not a lot
00:25 - going on with it and the things that
00:27 - remain to be done there are other things
00:32 - that we've done before sometimes
00:34 - multiple times on the stream or they're
00:38 - just not really a big deal so I don't
00:40 - know that they were streaming but today
00:43 - I want to kind of get you familiarized
00:47 - with the site that will be working on
00:50 - probably for for the rest of the month
00:55 - and just kind of let you know some of
00:59 - the background if you're interested I
01:04 - did do some videos where we were trying
01:07 - to fix this site a bit before so this is
01:11 - on my my youtube channel so there's a
01:15 - link in the description but the video
01:18 - that's first ever live coding session it
01:21 - I talked about this website in there I'm
01:25 - pretty sure let's see the quality yeah
01:27 - so the max quality is 720p and I think
01:30 - the font size is too small so it was my
01:33 - first session so I was kind of messing
01:35 - things up a bit
01:37 - but you can still hear me
01:40 - so you can get an idea of what's going
01:42 - on with this but I'm gonna try to
01:43 - summarize everything and what we're
01:46 - trying to accomplish so it's not
01:49 - necessary that you go back and watch
01:51 - that but if you wanted more info I think
01:53 - maybe this video and maybe the next two
01:55 - two or three live streams after are
01:58 - about this site and this is a site that
02:03 - I'm that we're working on it this is a
02:06 - public site so Franciscan edu and it's
02:12 - slow so there's other things wrong with
02:14 - the site but for today we're gonna focus
02:16 - on how slow it is
02:23 - I ran a page speed test earlier and this
02:30 - is what we got 29 out of 100 which is
02:34 - good compared to what it was so when I
02:38 - earlier this year I had some time to
02:41 - work on this site and the score was
02:43 - actually one so I'll have to find a
02:48 - screenshot a pretty shot took a
02:50 - screenshot of it this is the lowest
02:51 - score I've ever seen if I can find that
02:54 - I'll show you all but I'm pretty sure it
02:55 - was it was one and yeah so it's better
03:00 - than it was but there's still a lot so
03:02 - you can see some are easy things like
03:04 - just image reducing image sizes
03:07 - compressing images some are things that
03:11 - are a little bit more difficult and some
03:13 - things we won't be able to change we'll
03:16 - just kind of have to work with it so
03:18 - things like server response time I don't
03:21 - really have access to anything with the
03:23 - server right now this it's a whole
03:25 - different department where I work that
03:27 - handles that so I won't directly be able
03:29 - to change anything I can try to work
03:31 - with the other department though to get
03:34 - some things change so as you can see in
03:37 - this particular test server response
03:39 - time was 1.1 seconds that's not good
03:42 - I've seen it as high as seven seconds
03:44 - with this server and yeah so it doesn't
03:52 - matter how fast we make this site we
03:54 - still have to deal with this server
03:55 - response time so hopefully I can do
03:59 - something about that or at least talk to
04:01 - people who can do something about that
04:03 - also my camera keeps freezing so I will
04:14 - I'll try to fix it I don't know what the
04:17 - problem is but I came in today and it
04:22 - was it wasn't working so there's some
04:24 - command that I can type in to get it to
04:27 - work but it's only working temporarily
04:28 - so let's see all right let me let me go
04:42 - to the live chat quickly just to say hi
04:44 - before we get started
04:46 - hey everybody
04:51 - Oh is there Joseph says there's an apple
04:55 - event going on my streaming doing it
04:58 - during an event I've done this before
05:01 - I should pay more attention to what's
05:05 - going on but if I don't have a lot of
05:07 - people I'm gonna blame it on that but
05:08 - actually it looks like there's a lot of
05:10 - people right now I mean more than more
05:12 - than usual so yeah today we're going to
05:17 - work with some stuff that we are we've
05:20 - never worked with before so in
05:23 - particular this this site was built with
05:27 - a content management system called
05:29 - Ektron and that system is based off of
05:31 - dotnet framework and so there's some
05:33 - c-sharp stuff I don't know how much
05:35 - we're gonna get into c-sharp today but
05:38 - we will get into it at some point so we
05:40 - made we may start looking at it I don't
05:43 - know how much we're actually gonna edit
05:47 - let's see John B said no longer
05:51 - camera-shy
05:51 - yeah I'm trying this out I'm trying the
05:53 - camera thing uh-huh John B says I reach
05:59 - your camera a twenty nine out of 100
06:02 - would can I look and I improve is it the
06:05 - quality or is it my face I'm not all
06:12 - right cool so let's get started
06:15 - I always forget to do this at the
06:17 - beginning but if you're just watching
06:18 - for the first time though this stream is
06:20 - just about me doing my everyday work so
06:23 - it's not necessarily a tutorial although
06:27 - I try to explain things as I
06:28 - along and there are a lot of people in
06:29 - the live chat that are very helpful
06:31 - answering questions but I just want
06:34 - other developers to see what it's like
06:36 - for me to do my job I don't know if I'm
06:39 - an average developer or not I don't
06:41 - really know if my workflow is is the
06:44 - norm but I thought it would be useful if
06:47 - other people especially maybe people who
06:49 - work on their own or who are just kind
06:51 - of starting out could you see what it's
06:53 - like for me see how many mistakes I make
06:56 - and how I've worked through that and so
07:00 - that's so that's what we're doing here
07:02 - so if you do see a lot of mistakes if it
07:05 - seems like it's unscripted that's kind
07:08 - of the point so it's not scripted and I
07:11 - will make mistakes so that said let's
07:16 - get to it I like to organize the streams
07:19 - with Pomodoro timer so I'll do 25
07:22 - minutes of coding or you know whatever
07:25 - kind of whatever we happen to be doing
07:27 - it's not always code like right now
07:29 - we're gonna be going through some of the
07:32 - site speed things but I'm gonna do that
07:35 - for 25 minutes so I'll take a
07:36 - five-minute break and I'll go through
07:37 - the live chat and answer any questions
07:39 - you have and then we'll just repeat
07:41 - today we'll probably do two Pomodoro
07:43 - sessions I'd like to like to keep this
07:48 - dream a little bit short I'm still
07:50 - working on that react nanodegree and I
07:52 - have a project a Redux project due by
07:55 - Friday and it is not done yet so I need
08:00 - to work on it so that's why I don't want
08:03 - to do a really long stream I want to get
08:05 - done and work on it a little bit a
08:07 - little bit more okay so I'm just going
08:13 - to start with some explanation of what
08:17 - the site is what's what's wrong with it
08:19 - what we're gonna try to change hopefully
08:23 - you know by the end of September we'll
08:25 - see how much we can get done all right
08:27 - so this is the site the main site for
08:29 - the university that I work at I'm a
08:31 - front-end developer for Franciscan
08:34 - University this site was built before I
08:39 - started working here I think it it's a
08:42 - three years old in terms of when it was
08:44 - launched it's about three years but in
08:46 - terms of development it's pushing four
08:48 - years I think because the site was built
08:51 - and went underwent a lot of testing and
08:53 - things so it's about four years old and
08:58 - it's definitely in need of some bigger
09:00 - updates than we're gonna handle this
09:02 - month but the completely redesigning
09:06 - everything from the ground up is going
09:08 - to be a project that's going to come
09:10 - hopefully within the next year but not
09:13 - not right now so right now we're just
09:16 - going to try to make the best of what we
09:17 - have all right and what we have as I
09:20 - mentioned earlier is a site built off
09:24 - the Ektron content management system if
09:26 - you've never heard of ektron then I'm
09:28 - not surprised because I never heard of
09:30 - ektron before I started here and it's
09:37 - it's a challenging content management
09:39 - system to work with luckily I don't have
09:41 - to do that much with it there are other
09:43 - people in my department who handle most
09:45 - of the content management with that and
09:48 - I don't usually have to deal deal with
09:51 - it directly but right now we've already
09:57 - showed you the the site speed rating and
10:01 - if you wanted to look at this in more
10:03 - detail you could just run the site speed
10:05 - test yourself on the site but the first
10:09 - thing that we're definitely going to be
10:11 - able to do is we're gonna be able to
10:13 - compress some of these images but even
10:15 - better than that what I think we can do
10:17 - is actually get rid of some images so
10:21 - let's see browser caching I don't know
10:26 - that I can do anything about the caching
10:27 - so things that I can't do anything about
10:29 - I'm gonna hide we can try to eliminate
10:32 - the render blocking JavaScript and CSS
10:34 - I'll show you in a minute what we're
10:39 - kind of what we're dealing with here in
10:42 - terms of how this gets put into you know
10:46 - by Extron you know how things get put
10:48 - together so I don't have complete
10:50 - control over over all the files some of
10:55 - them are
10:55 - created dynamically and just put in here
10:58 - and there but we'll do the best we can
10:59 - you see this there's quite a few files
11:03 - being loaded here can't do anything
11:04 - directly about the server response time
11:07 - and we're gonna try to fix this you know
11:11 - prioritize visible content but that's
11:14 - that's going to need we need to do some
11:16 - work also when it comes to minifying the
11:19 - JavaScript I I can't
11:24 - minify a lot of these directly because I
11:27 - don't know where they're coming in at so
11:30 - that's one of the bad things about
11:32 - Extron is there's not really an exxon
11:35 - community like if this was WordPress I'd
11:38 - probably find 500 articles about how
11:41 - something works probably more with
11:44 - Ektron not so much the company that made
11:48 - Ektron originally got bought out by
11:50 - another company so I'm not even sure it
11:52 - what the support is like with Exxon
11:55 - anymore
11:58 - and then minify HTML probably won't be
12:02 - able to minify the HTML and uh if you're
12:06 - if you're wondering why we can't do
12:07 - certain things it'll be a little bit
12:09 - more clear in a minute although I know
12:11 - some of you are good with c-sharp Sarno
12:14 - Umberto's good with c-sharp so maybe
12:16 - some things that I don't think I can do
12:18 - right now maybe we can do and I just
12:20 - don't don't know how so anyway that's
12:23 - what we're dealing with the biggest
12:26 - images on the page are obviously the
12:28 - images in this slider and they all load
12:30 - so these there's no lazy loading going
12:32 - on here all these images load and
12:38 - they're all pretty big now obviously
12:42 - they need to be a certain size if it's
12:44 - gonna be you know a large slider like
12:47 - this but some images are actually really
12:50 - big and they don't need to be like this
12:52 - image is one of the largest images on
12:54 - the page but it's tiny right so there's
12:57 - little things like that that we can
12:58 - change and that really the the people
13:01 - who are updating this site through the
13:03 - content management system need to be
13:06 - aware of
13:08 - the size of images that they're putting
13:10 - in and making sure that they compress
13:12 - the images so we'll handle that I don't
13:17 - want to do too much compression and
13:19 - things and image resizing on the stream
13:21 - because I don't think that's it's just
13:23 - not really exciting stuff it might be
13:25 - worth it just to go over how I do it but
13:28 - I don't want to go through a ton of
13:29 - images and do you know resizing and
13:33 - things some of the images I think we can
13:35 - get rid of are these I don't think that
13:40 - we need these here and these are these
13:43 - images are pretty big so each one of
13:45 - these sections we could probably take
13:47 - the images out completely we want to
13:50 - make sure I did go through a few months
13:52 - ago and made sure these images were the
13:54 - correct size and compressed but it's
13:56 - possible that you know some new ones
13:58 - have been uploaded so we want to double
14:00 - check that the same way this image
14:02 - changes frequently so we want to double
14:04 - check to make sure that image is is
14:07 - working correctly I know the user
14:12 - interface wise there's a ton of stuff I
14:14 - want to change with this user interface
14:16 - but the first thing that I want to worry
14:19 - about is the the load times because if
14:21 - if the page takes too long to load and
14:24 - someone doesn't even stick around to see
14:26 - it then it doesn't matter how nice it
14:28 - looks it could be the best looking site
14:30 - ever made but if it takes you know 50
14:33 - seconds to load no one's gonna see it
14:38 - all right so let me see if there's ice
14:41 - want to see if there's any questions
14:43 - quickly in the live chat about you know
14:45 - but before we actually start to dig into
14:48 - some of the some of the code so I'm just
14:52 - going to quickly kind of scroll through
14:54 - this and see if there's any questions
14:55 - related to the site
15:07 - okay all right cool it looks like
15:10 - nothing related to this site although
15:11 - John Hanson does say if you do a Google
15:13 - page speed test they'll actually give
15:15 - you the compressed files to download the
15:17 - images yeah that's true I'm glad you
15:20 - mentioned that
15:21 - I'm see where they are at the bottom
15:24 - yeah so you can download we do a page
15:27 - speed test you can download all your
15:30 - compressed resources so I have used some
15:36 - of these before so we may we may get
15:40 - some of these for the images I have I
15:43 - use image magic on the command line and
15:45 - I have I'm able to get better
15:47 - compression than I can get from these
15:50 - also we're gonna need to resize some of
15:52 - them as well but it'll probably be
15:54 - useful to grab some of this JavaScript
15:56 - and CSS at some point you know we could
16:00 - benefit ourselves but if it's already
16:02 - done for us then you know why not use it
16:04 - all right so we're just gonna deal with
16:10 - the home page for now obviously that
16:14 - gets the most visitors and it's also the
16:15 - page that takes the longest by far to
16:18 - load so some of the Interior pages
16:19 - aren't quite as bad for load times so
16:25 - we'll see how it goes if I don't think
16:28 - we'll get this you know to where we
16:31 - really want it in the amount of time
16:33 - that we have but if we if we do we'll
16:34 - move on maybe in work on some interior
16:36 - pages I'm gonna be using sue I want to
16:43 - bring this over so it's closer all right
16:48 - there we go I want to bring I want to
16:53 - show you my Trello board as well so I do
16:58 - have a Trello board that I already made
17:00 - a few months ago just a lot of things
17:03 - that I thought could be done to help
17:05 - with load time so you know we're gonna
17:09 - we're gonna go through some of these we
17:11 - don't have to come up with everything
17:13 - you know on our own right now so you
17:18 - know a basic stuff minify these files
17:20 - but some of the things are
17:21 - actually redoing the UI so that we can
17:25 - get away with not having so many images
17:27 - or we can completely get rid of some
17:29 - pieces of code that for whatever reason
17:32 - are slowing things down a bit this is
17:35 - the file that we're going to be working
17:38 - with mostly as you can see I'm actually
17:44 - using Visual Studio code so I know we
17:51 - always have peeps someone always asks
17:53 - about my code editors so it's Visual
17:55 - Studio code this time and not Adam so I
18:00 - have we're mainly going to be working in
18:03 - this file although you can see there's a
18:05 - lot of different things linked into this
18:07 - file so we're gonna have to dig into
18:08 - some of these other files as well but
18:10 - this is a copy of the the template that
18:18 - is used for the home page so we'll do
18:22 - everything in the copy so we don't mess
18:25 - up the home page and when we get it to a
18:28 - point where it's it's good we like it
18:30 - then we can just copy it over or change
18:34 - the name and use that instead for the
18:38 - home page so just kind of scrolling
18:40 - through quickly up here we're importing
18:43 - so it's actually it's not it's not
18:46 - really that in terms of organization and
18:50 - what's going on there there's some
18:52 - similarities to what we're doing with
18:54 - react right we're importing a lot of
18:56 - other great components I don't know what
18:58 - the terminology is for extra honor for
19:01 - for.net framework stuff but in terms of
19:04 - the terminology that we've been using
19:06 - with react you know we're importing
19:07 - components up here and then down here
19:12 - we're mixing HTML with some of these
19:16 - other try to find it okay with some of
19:22 - these these tags here right so we can
19:27 - put in you know these things that we've
19:30 - imported up there we put them in with
19:32 - these tags and we pass props to them
19:34 - right so it's it's really a lot like
19:37 - react components it just at least
19:40 - superficially I have no idea what's
19:41 - going on behind the scenes and whether
19:43 - it's comparable to react but at least
19:48 - you know so the we can reason about it
19:49 - that's basically what it is and I'm
19:51 - probably gonna still use react
19:53 - terminology because like I said I don't
19:55 - really know what the exon terminology is
19:57 - for this stuff and I don't really care
19:59 - to learn it since we're not gonna be
20:01 - using it for that much longer anyway
20:05 - so let's go into let's go in into the
20:16 - the code is controlling this this
20:21 - carousel here so this is kind of like
20:23 - the hero section carousel I want to get
20:27 - rid of it I want it to be completely
20:29 - gone right this that seems to me like
20:34 - it'll have the biggest immediate impact
20:36 - on load times out of anything else that
20:40 - I could do or at least that I could
20:42 - easily do because these are the largest
20:45 - images I get rid of one oops actually
20:51 - it's not even some weird stuff going on
20:54 - there's they're like three or four
20:55 - images I think four images so four large
20:58 - images on the page can be gone we'll get
21:00 - rid of that and we'll also get rid of
21:02 - these so basically the eighth-largest
21:09 - images on the page we're gonna get rid
21:10 - of I think that's gonna have a huge
21:12 - impact also wouldn't be a bad idea to
21:17 - just do just a baseline to see what our
21:21 - load times are so let's just check out
21:25 - I'm gonna change my network conditions
21:27 - here and throttle it let's go with let's
21:31 - go with a fast 3G and see what it's like
21:33 - on Fast 3G I like to slow it down just
21:37 - so that I get a better idea of what it's
21:40 - like for people with slower connections
21:41 - and also you can kind of see things
21:43 - loading when it's a slower connection
21:47 - so I'm just gonna refresh and we'll see
21:56 - see what we get
22:05 - you see how slow that was right like
22:07 - waiting for the response and the network
22:09 - that was really slow all right so we're
22:19 - still waiting I mean at this point it's
22:21 - the page is usable but not everything is
22:24 - loaded yet so you scroll down it's
22:28 - pretty much everything was loaded we're
22:30 - still waiting on some of these images
22:34 - okay are we done now
22:36 - yeah all right total load time thirty
22:39 - five point seven five seconds so almost
22:42 - 36 seconds total load time right
22:45 - obviously the page was usable you could
22:48 - see content a lot earlier than that but
22:53 - you know you still had this little thing
22:55 - you know go on up here or whatever it
22:59 - does with Chrome a humph
23:01 - for for 36 seconds that's crazy that's I
23:07 - don't know I don't know let you but to
23:09 - me that's just really slow so let's
23:15 - let's just see what took the longest all
23:22 - right let's see what the biggest files
23:24 - were so we have an image okay this is up
23:31 - there and that in the slider but I think
23:35 - that's the main image there and then we
23:37 - have okay this is the one with the
23:41 - president the university this one is
23:46 - that image that's that's here that's
23:49 - really small that should not be this big
23:53 - right where this image is 370 kilobytes
24:00 - it's crazy that first image one point
24:02 - three megabytes that's completely
24:03 - unacceptable
24:04 - okay as we go down it gets better but as
24:09 - as usual your biggest files or images
24:14 - that's I mean unless you have video on
24:16 - your site your biggest files are
24:17 - probably
24:18 - always going to be images you can see we
24:20 - are loading some bigger JavaScript files
24:24 - so jQuery UI
24:26 - completes right I wonder if we really
24:30 - need that or if we need we need
24:32 - everything there I'm interested to see
24:34 - if that's okay at least it's minified
24:39 - that's that's good that's crazy that
24:43 - it's still that big even minified though
24:46 - we'd see these anything that says banner
24:48 - those are those big sections here right
24:53 - so they're kind of towards the top as
24:55 - well we want to get rid of that okay it
25:03 - looks like there's there's no surprises
25:04 - I was kind of looking for something up
25:08 - towards the top that would just be you
25:10 - know really big but it's not not bad I
25:18 - mean I expected it with the images so so
25:23 - that's definitely I think where we need
25:24 - to goodness 24 seconds for that Wow
25:31 - that's where we need to look first
25:32 - that's we're gonna have the biggest
25:33 - impact okay oh I did I just looked over
25:40 - the live chat quickly and
25:47 - I noticed that my camera stops I'm
25:49 - resetting that again if anybody ever has
25:52 - it has had issues with an iMac camera
25:55 - just all of a sudden not working right
25:58 - like the little green light just goes
25:59 - black and bright in the middle of me
26:03 - doing stuff it's right on the main
26:06 - screen
26:07 - - hmm excuse me
26:11 - it's yawning my secondary screen I
26:14 - haven't had any problems with that but
26:16 - the angle is weird so you just see like
26:19 - the side of my face the whole time so
26:23 - anyway I'll probably end up getting a
26:26 - like a USB webcam at some point so it
26:29 - shouldn't be a problem for that much
26:30 - longer but for now it's just a little
26:32 - annoyance but I also saw Nova blow asked
26:35 - why I'm in incognito mode because I I'm
26:41 - an administrator for this site it
26:43 - automatically logs me in and I don't
26:45 - really want to lock myself out on when
26:48 - I'm using Chrome not in incognito mode
26:50 - and other files get loaded and so I
26:55 - don't want to mess with the
26:56 - administrator type you know files that
26:59 - get for the UI for the admins I just
27:03 - want to see what other people see so
27:04 - that's why I'm doing it in incognito
27:06 - mode
27:13 - it also allows me to switch right over
27:15 - it so I usually have the same site open
27:18 - in normally in Chrome with the admin
27:22 - features there so I can switch over and
27:24 - change things really quick without
27:25 - having to log in and log back out every
27:30 - time I look at this site I just see more
27:31 - things that I don't want to fix and
27:35 - change okay
27:46 - so let me show you if we're gonna take
27:51 - this out we need to replace it with
27:53 - something right we can't just completely
27:55 - remove it that would look kind of weird
28:00 - let me show you what I'm thinking of for
28:03 - the replacement yeah sorry
28:08 - yawning again I don't know what's going
28:11 - on I don't think I brought it over yet
28:17 - but still be on my other screen all
28:20 - right so let me show you what I'm
28:28 - thinking so this this obviously when you
28:30 - see it you're gonna know why I'm saying
28:31 - this obviously isn't gonna be what we
28:33 - put in here but just kind of the basic
28:35 - structure is gonna be more what we use
28:37 - so let me try to do as much of side by
28:43 - side as I can so right now you see this
28:45 - is the the header here's our menus not
28:52 - not really a fan of this too much here's
28:57 - what I'd like to to move it to and this
29:02 - should look at least somewhat familiar
29:03 - since this kind of the same style is
29:05 - what we used on our last project but I'd
29:07 - like to switch over to this I think I'll
29:09 - take this logo out and use our new logo
29:11 - that we used on our last project when I
29:15 - did this before I don't think I had the
29:17 - new logo yet so that will change but
29:22 - you'd see I've moved the header I move
29:26 - some stuff around on the header I think
29:28 - it looks looks more clean I've had
29:31 - actually added some of the social media
29:33 - icons so I think it looks a lot nicer I
29:38 - Shrunk the search search bar a bit and
29:43 - added a lot of things in the sidebar so
29:46 - you can see all those menu items are
29:49 - still there but now they've moved over
29:52 - over here okay and we have search over
29:55 - there as well if you're interested in
29:58 - how I did this
29:59 - check out those videos on my channel
30:01 - that I showed you at the beginning
30:02 - because I do go through a lot of how I
30:05 - did this header and how I did this this
30:08 - background so it's it's really simple I
30:10 - mean it's a simple like parallax style
30:12 - background but I'm thinking right now we
30:15 - have four big images and sometimes we
30:17 - have even more images on here just
30:19 - depends on how many are uploaded at any
30:22 - given time so we'll go from that down to
30:25 - one large image so we'll still have a
30:29 - hero section we just won't have all
30:32 - those images so this is just a stock
30:36 - photo obviously we also have and you can
30:43 - see I didn't finish this right we have a
30:44 - spot for you know for some text a
30:47 - call-to-action button right and then
30:52 - below obviously I haven't read I haven't
30:57 - finished this but you can see I've gone
31:02 - with a full-width wow that's weird
31:05 - that's really weird I haven't seen that
31:08 - happen before
31:13 - hmm that's crazy
31:18 - I've honestly never seen that happen
31:23 - oh is that I don't know what I'm I don't
31:30 - know what happened there I guess I
31:32 - turned off that that's server yeah all
31:38 - right
31:43 - oh that's why so I I didn't have any of
31:48 - my NPM modules installed for that
31:51 - project and so my gulp server wasn't
31:55 - running so anyway I'm gonna I'm
31:57 - installing things on my other screen
32:00 - here so but did you get the idea of kind
32:06 - of what I want to do is just kind of
32:09 - redesign this section here so I can get
32:11 - rid of these images I'm also gonna be
32:13 - able to get rid of a lot of these images
32:15 - as well so look we have you know we have
32:18 - more images here and it'll clean things
32:23 - up there and I mean we're gonna get rid
32:26 - of at least a dozen images so definitely
32:33 - gonna be it's gonna be a lot more light
32:38 - wait and see looks like
32:58 - for some reason my my install fails all
33:08 - right then so I'm getting some area that
33:13 - I've never seen before
33:24 - I'll give it another shot see if it
33:26 - works not really a big deal we can still
33:28 - do a lot of this without mmm just own
33:34 - that again shoot okay so my um my timer
33:39 - went up so now is a good time this to
33:41 - break for five minutes I'll go over the
33:43 - live chat and then while I'm doing that
33:47 - let's see
33:58 - yes I'll bring this over to so y'all can
34:00 - see what's going on here all right so
34:07 - check that out I'm in tonight hopefully
34:15 - you won't see the air again but if it
34:16 - comes up you'll see it don't ya so
34:41 - all right so I may just have to that's
34:47 - really weird
34:48 - I just have to check that out later on
34:53 - all right so I'm going to scroll up a
34:55 - bit and I'm gonna go through the live
34:56 - chat answer questions for five minutes
34:58 - and then we'll go back and try to
35:01 - actually get changed some things on this
35:03 - page okay Michael will Avila says give
35:13 - me a shout out so actually just shut up
35:18 - anyway so there's a shout out so thanks
35:21 - for watching thanks for for being
35:23 - involved in the live chat
35:41 - all right Patrick says he sharp for the
35:43 - win not but I hear dotnet core 2 is
35:46 - really fast as opposed to older dotnet
35:48 - tech yeah unfortunately this is older
35:51 - dog net tech so so not to me working
35:54 - with the new cool stuff yet
36:04 - yeah
36:09 - all right I'm just I'm still scrolling
36:11 - through trying to find some questions
36:13 - here in the live chat
36:15 - okay so des es says just starting out
36:20 - and want to get in the IT world is
36:22 - front-end or back-end the best or ideal
36:25 - way to go I think it honestly depends on
36:31 - what you're interested in
36:33 - I don't know I guess I've I've seen or
36:39 - either read about examples of people
36:41 - starting with either front-end or
36:43 - back-end and then sometimes they moved
36:45 - to they switch sometimes they go full
36:49 - stack I don't know it really does depend
36:54 - on what you're more interested in as to
36:55 - where you want to start out you could
36:57 - always switch yeah I guess it would be
37:01 - hard to answer you know in general from
37:06 - what I've seen and this is you know I've
37:09 - not studied this you know but just from
37:12 - like casually observing it does seem
37:14 - like salaries for back-end are slightly
37:17 - higher than for front-end but I don't
37:20 - know if that's just if that's true
37:22 - across the board or you know just the
37:24 - few times I've noticed it so I don't
37:28 - know that could be a factor for you
37:34 - rune grin shoe says learn front end
37:37 - stuff somewhat well then learn back-end
37:39 - then combine and improve join B says
37:46 - depends on if you prefer working with
37:48 - routing and networking or if you prefer
37:49 - working with design and user interfaces
37:52 - front-end is UI back-end is routing a
37:55 - networking Verito says I don't think I'm
37:59 - ever gonna be very good at front-end
38:01 - design just not something I'm very
38:03 - interested in or good at for that matter
38:07 - yeah I'm Berto I would say if you're not
38:12 - interested in it then there's really
38:13 - probably not much reason to try to try
38:16 - to work on it but if you did want to get
38:19 - better at it I think it's one of those
38:20 - things that it's
38:23 - takes time right it takes a long time to
38:28 - just get that I to look at something and
38:30 - say and I'm not saying I have this
38:31 - perfectly but just comparing myself to
38:33 - where I was like let's say five years
38:35 - ago to be able to look at a website and
38:37 - immediately start to pick out places
38:40 - where the design could be improved
38:42 - whether there's just obvious things or
38:45 - to be able to look at a blank page and
38:47 - just start to visualize where everything
38:49 - would go I that just takes a lot of time
38:54 - of being exposed to it I don't know I
38:59 - kind of think that you get all this
39:01 - information in your brain from seeing so
39:03 - many websites and trying to think
39:05 - critically about them and then at some
39:06 - point it's just it just kind of happens
39:09 - naturally all right it's not like it
39:12 - seems like you're just good at it but I
39:14 - don't think it's the case that people
39:16 - are just good I think it's that your
39:17 - brain gradually gets used to picking
39:21 - those things out so anyway that's just
39:23 - my my take on it all right I'm going to
39:31 - go back and do some more coding I said
39:34 - we're gonna do one more Pomodoro session
39:36 - and then then I'll answer the rest of
39:39 - the questions and let's see I will say I
39:46 - do want to give a little elaborate a
39:48 - little bit more on what I was just
39:49 - talking about especially for people who
39:51 - are just starting out I I've seen and
39:59 - maybe you all have seen this recently
40:02 - there's a like a little comic that I've
40:04 - seen online too where somebody's a
40:07 - writer there's two people talking to
40:08 - each other and the one one person is
40:11 - saying you know I how do I get to be a
40:13 - better writer like I'm still no good I
40:15 - think it's writing and maybe it's an
40:17 - artist I don't remember but he's asking
40:19 - someone more experienced and a more
40:21 - experienced person just as like just
40:23 - keep practicing and the person says well
40:25 - what I've been practicing look at all
40:27 - the stuff I've done and it shows a pile
40:29 - of work you know pile of papers and the
40:32 - other person's I think says something
40:34 - like well we'll just just keep going
40:36 - and that you see their pile and it's
40:38 - huge like you know it's it's way bigger
40:41 - than the other pile so I think it's kind
40:43 - of the same thing when it comes to
40:45 - coding it can be applied to that that
40:47 - and and I don't think it's just like a
40:52 - design thing or a front-end thing I
40:53 - think it's any area it just takes a ton
40:57 - of practice before you start to get
40:59 - really good at it and again I'm not
41:03 - claiming that I'm even at that point of
41:05 - being really good at it there's
41:07 - definitely a lot of things that I'm Way
41:08 - better at than I used to be but there's
41:12 - certainly more room for improvement and
41:15 - I always likes like sports metaphors
41:20 - sometimes are easy sometimes easier to
41:23 - think about it in terms of like a
41:25 - physical activity because the results
41:28 - are just so obvious right in front of
41:29 - you but I know they used to tell me when
41:34 - I played American football and in high
41:37 - school the more you practice so I was I
41:41 - was a quarterback and they said the more
41:43 - you throw the more you you get to see
41:45 - what's going on in the field from you
41:47 - that quarterbacks perspective things
41:49 - they'd say it would they would slow down
41:51 - right so initially like when you're
41:53 - trying to find if someone the receiver
41:55 - is open to throw the ball to it just
41:57 - looks crazy and confusing but you just
42:00 - have to do it so many times and
42:02 - eventually your brain you get so used to
42:06 - it it doesn't seem as chaotic it slows
42:09 - down right and so I think it's it's the
42:13 - same way like you look at code and it's
42:14 - not just this jumble of mess you see
42:16 - what's going on you can follow the flow
42:19 - of it you look at a website design it
42:21 - you see what should which should be
42:24 - there so anyway that was meant to be
42:30 - like somewhat encouraging that like if
42:32 - you're not there yet don't feel like
42:34 - there's something wrong with you you
42:35 - just need to keep going although I guess
42:38 - you could take it as daunting as well
42:40 - thinking like wow I'm gonna I'm gonna
42:44 - have to do the ton of work but anyway
42:49 - let's get back to this also I did have
42:55 - an issue all this morning I was working
42:57 - on this bug and I just want to share
42:59 - with you in case somebody runs into a
43:01 - similar situation maybe it'll save you a
43:03 - lot of time so I was sending form data
43:05 - to a Google sheet and then saving it in
43:10 - a spreadsheet and emailing it from there
43:12 - but what I was doing I was taking the
43:14 - form data and serializing it and then
43:17 - sending it well one of the pieces of
43:21 - data was the value of a text area and
43:24 - occasionally we wouldn't get all the
43:27 - data it would cut off in the middle of
43:29 - what someone was trying to send and
43:32 - right obviously that's a problem because
43:34 - we wouldn't get all the information that
43:35 - we needed and I could not figure it out
43:37 - and I was trying to figure out what
43:38 - browsers it was and testing on different
43:41 - browsers and trying to look things up
43:43 - couldn't find any information on text
43:46 - areas getting cut off finally I went
43:50 - back in and looked exactly at where
43:52 - everything was getting cut off and it
43:54 - was getting cut off right at a point
43:55 - where they were using and so they were
43:59 - using an ampersand and when a date is
44:03 - serialized it just dropped everything
44:05 - after that because it assumed everything
44:08 - after that was was like part of the next
44:10 - piece of data so I had actually just
44:14 - went through and before I sent it before
44:17 - I see I realized that I went through and
44:20 - changed all ampersands to two and so a
44:24 - and B and I put it in there so that was
44:28 - the fake so if anybody ever has data
44:30 - being dropped like that and you're from
44:32 - forums
44:33 - maybe it's that check check that out so
44:36 - I don't know why I never thought about
44:37 - that when I was first doing that that
44:40 - form but really glad I found it snakes
44:45 - that I had to spend so much time to find
44:46 - it but it feels good when you find out
44:49 - the solution to to a bug so anyway not
44:54 - related to this project but could be
44:57 - helpful for someone
44:58 - oops
45:00 - all right so I said something's wrong
45:04 - with this I did have this running in
45:08 - basically I had it I had it in a
45:12 - different directory so everything that I
45:15 - had done before was a branch on another
45:17 - git repo and I wanted to make it its own
45:20 - get repo so I moved basically I moved it
45:24 - over a copy and pasted a bunch of stuff
45:26 - I initialized a new git repo and then
45:28 - for whatever reason now it's not it's
45:31 - not working right so I'll have to that's
45:34 - why it did work before and we could see
45:36 - it at first but now I'll have to work on
45:43 - that okay so let's go in now what we
45:50 - need to do we need to find where the
45:53 - data is being pulled in for this header
45:56 - and where it's being pulled in for this
46:00 - as well right because it's not most of
46:06 - the stuff is not directly in that master
46:08 - template it's in one of the components
46:11 - that are being imported so we're gonna
46:14 - have to do a little bit of digging and
46:17 - this file structure is not it's not well
46:20 - organized this this file structure has
46:22 - been worked on by multiple people over
46:24 - years before I even got here and so it's
46:28 - a little bit it's a little bit crazy
46:30 - just as an example we have all these
46:38 - different configs and they're named
46:40 - original config original older config
46:44 - this is actually another copy called web
46:46 - may 7 text and it's it's a text file but
46:49 - it's just a copy of the config right so
46:52 - there's not even a standard like naming
46:55 - convention or anything so it makes it a
46:58 - little bit difficult to find things but
47:01 - at least we'll have we'll have some
47:03 - hints here because we can look at what's
47:04 - being imported here okay so main nav I
47:10 - if I had to guess I'd say main nav was
47:13 - probably
47:14 - that navbar that we're looking for let
47:16 - me know if this the font is too small
47:19 - for you I can make it bigger and let's
47:23 - see
47:35 - hmm
47:39 - we'll probably need we need to actually
47:44 - I'm not gonna bring in so I think we can
47:47 - strike a balance between things that we
47:49 - pull in that that it's data from the
47:53 - from the content management system and
47:55 - things that we can hard code in I'm not
47:57 - opposed to hard coding in this case
47:59 - because we're this is just a kind of a
48:04 - temporary thing to make the site a
48:06 - little bit more bearable until we can
48:08 - redo the site so things that are not
48:11 - likely to change like our social media
48:14 - URLs I have no problem at all hard
48:17 - coding those so could probably safely
48:20 - just get rid of this at some point hard
48:22 - code the social media links and those
48:25 - aren't gonna change but let's try to
48:30 - find this main nav and I do want to
48:32 - scroll down to the point where that nav
48:37 - comes in at to see if I want to see
48:41 - where that that slider is is is coming
48:44 - in it as well so let's scroll down a bit
48:47 - we're still at some strip things so you
48:52 - see there's a lot of different just as
48:53 - we scroll there's a lot of different
48:55 - JavaScript stuff going on things being
48:58 - being imported different places so we
49:03 - can mess around with this and try to
49:04 - move them around for you try to move
49:09 - them around a bit see if we can increase
49:12 - load of times just by maybe pulling in
49:16 - some of this stuff you down at the
49:19 - bottom
49:23 - okay all right
49:47 - okay oh and the utility now this is
49:51 - interesting so it looks like a few of
49:54 - these knobs are kind of put together so
49:57 - we may need to work on all of them okay
50:04 - so that's the top section now this is
50:06 - where
50:15 - okay all right so everything that's
50:17 - that's between the footer and the header
50:19 - is all in a difference a different
50:23 - component
50:35 - okay let's go check out that that Navin
50:44 - so we'll go to user controls main of all
50:49 - right we can look this will probably be
50:53 - faster
51:19 - there we go
51:36 - all right so I mean
51:41 - okay look say we got some jQuery going
51:43 - on at the top for the search for the
51:48 - search box which we should be able to
51:51 - get rid of most of it
52:02 - okay here we go yeah we're in the right
52:04 - spot now we can see the different the
52:10 - different links here
52:26 - actually we could see and this is kind
52:28 - of odd when I first looked at this I was
52:30 - not sure what was going on but here's
52:32 - what what happens so we can see all this
52:38 - HTML and it looks like this stuff is
52:40 - hard-coded but at some point it pulls in
52:46 - the data from the content management
52:52 - system so all this hard-coded stuff up
52:54 - here doesn't really mean anything this
52:56 - is what's important and this is
52:58 - basically our components and then props
53:02 - are getting passed in after data is
53:07 - being pulled from the content management
53:10 - system so this is what we need to worry
53:12 - about and this is what I wanted to see
53:13 - because what we want to do we're going
53:17 - to totally change you know the HTML of
53:20 - that header to make it match what we're
53:22 - doing with our header and our side nav
53:25 - so I want to be able to grab these and
53:29 - input them in and I need to figure out
53:32 - so okay that's you know what are they
53:35 - doing here obviously if this was react
53:38 - right I'd I'd be pulling in data and
53:41 - mapping over it and things like that
53:42 - well I'm not exactly sure how to do that
53:45 - and with this so it seems like we can
53:50 - use this repeater and that will loop
53:55 - through everything
54:05 - so there's definitely some stuff going
54:07 - on that I'm just like I'm not sure about
54:10 - but how do we have nested item templates
54:12 - here what does that even see so there's
54:16 - weird stuff that I'm just not not
54:18 - entirely sure what's going on with that
54:31 - Wow that is a very long string of data
54:35 - there
54:36 - [Music]
54:45 - okay I'd say what I ought to do then is
54:59 - bring in actually I'm gonna look at the
55:01 - live chat quickly to see because I know
55:02 - there's some of you that use that
55:06 - possibly could be more familiar with
55:07 - this just going to check briefly
55:29 - okay I'm there to asked if this was
55:32 - there's a repo I think I think I saw
55:36 - that somewhere now I can't find it again
55:37 - Oh a lot of this stuff isn't a private
55:44 - repo right now I can probably pull some
55:51 - of it at least some of it I think could
55:56 - be in a public repo repo yeah it would
56:01 - just have to be limited yeah I'll have
56:06 - to double check and see what just to
56:09 - make sure like you know cuz there's a
56:11 - config file and stuff in here that has
56:13 - like database passwords and things so
56:16 - I'll have to double check and see what's
56:18 - actually committed to the repo and if I
56:22 - can make it public
56:26 - also someone was talking about errors
56:34 - okay lose john john hanson saying there
56:37 - are 71 errors on that page browsers will
56:40 - have have to perform error correction
56:43 - wait there are 71 airs on tweets on this
56:49 - page 379 airs
57:01 - are we talking about something else
57:23 - okay Tom asked what is a SC X to be
57:29 - honest with you I don't know what it
57:31 - stands for but basically these are these
57:34 - are templates so if you want to think in
57:36 - JavaScript terms and react terms this is
57:39 - kind of like if you had a dot JSX file
57:42 - and I mean that's really a loose
57:43 - comparison right because I'm admittedly
57:46 - I'm not really familiar with this so I'm
57:51 - not I'm just trying to learn as much as
57:55 - I I can as much as I have to to make
57:58 - these changes so it's going to be a lot
58:00 - of trial and error but I imagine this is
58:04 - not this is not that uncommon that you
58:08 - would come into a project that was
58:10 - already existing projects kind of like a
58:13 - legacy thing and I have to work with it
58:16 - and not really have a lot of freedom to
58:19 - change things drastically so that's what
58:23 - you know that's what we're gonna have to
58:24 - do so what I want to do right here I
58:27 - think is copy and paste a bunch of this
58:31 - stuff and then
58:49 - I don't know about this search right now
59:01 - I didn't really want to bring in all
59:02 - this this jQuery but maybe I'll bring
59:09 - I'm not worried about the search right
59:10 - now I can bring that in later but let's
59:15 - let's pull in I have to find that that
59:26 - other template or was it there yeah okay
59:42 - so usually I want to pull in
59:47 - all right i need's need to format this
59:51 - it's easier to read so let's just it
59:54 - format is HTML for now okay
60:10 - okay so this is where we were pulling in
60:13 - Main Ave so let's comment that out for
60:22 - now
60:23 - and then put some of this in here and
60:31 - let's see what it does and I need to
60:33 - figure out
60:45 - I need to figure out what URL this test
60:48 - page is at
60:57 - I don't remember okay cool so we have an
61:03 - answer so ASC X is the file extension
61:07 - for asp.net or asp.net not really sure
61:12 - how you're supposed to pronounce it but
61:13 - I'm going to say ask because that seems
61:15 - like it would be faster
61:33 - says basically a scx makes it files make
61:37 - it easy to use the same code across
61:38 - multiple asp.net web pages cool alright
61:55 - let's
61:59 - I can't remember tents sorry everyone
62:12 - I cannot remember what the URL is for
62:15 - the test version of this because I made
62:19 - it in at the beginning of this year and
62:25 - I haven't been on it for a long time so
62:27 - let's see I'm gonna look it up here so
62:34 - on my other screen I'm in the content
62:36 - management system I don't want to show
62:37 - you this right now because I don't want
62:40 - to show something that shouldn't be on
62:41 - like in terms of May there might be
62:46 - content that's scheduled to be released
62:48 - that shouldn't be public yet I don't
62:53 - really know I don't use this often
62:54 - enough to even know if that's if that's
62:56 - a thing but just in case
63:11 - okay I was close
63:49 - all right cool so I got it so here's
63:53 - here's the page and you all can go to
63:54 - this this is public Franciscan ddu slash
63:58 - home test and we've got an error which
64:05 - is cool I kind of expected we get some
64:07 - air because we just copy and paste at a
64:09 - ton of stuff that to be honest with you
64:12 - I didn't completely understand anyway
64:14 - just you know million Li because of the
64:17 - syntax that I want it used to but let's
64:19 - see we're line 352 line 352 so there's
64:32 - this that's the first line that we
64:34 - actually put put this in so let's get
64:41 - rid of a lot of this stuff oops
64:50 - okay let's get rid of that since that
64:55 - was all I can see now that this looks
64:58 - like it was commented out anyway
65:07 - alright now let's see if we can figure
65:09 - out why that's not working we have
65:29 - I'd say that see
65:36 - and in case you you notice this we are
65:42 - in fact cowboy coding right now so there
65:46 - really is not a test version of this
65:48 - site
65:48 - I can't do anything about that that's
65:52 - just I know that that's that's not good
65:57 - but there's supposed to be a beta
66:01 - version of this site but unfortunately
66:04 - it shares all the same files I'm not
66:08 - really sure I think it has a different
66:12 - database but all the files are the same
66:14 - so if I go to change a file for the test
66:18 - version it also changes things on the
66:20 - live version so for our purposes we're
66:25 - editing the live version of the site and
66:27 - there's not really anything that that I
66:29 - can do about that
66:40 - okay let me check again sis's
66:54 - okay the name Chow has taxonomy does not
66:57 - exist in the current context
66:59 - alright so probably you copy something
67:07 - over whoops
67:10 - hmm I lost some other file let's split
67:14 - this
67:23 - let's check out
67:31 - there we go shrink that give us a little
67:34 - bit more space I don't think I clicked
67:44 - on the wrong thing there we go
67:49 - there actually let me see this as well
67:58 - this each dot aspx page has this dot CS
68:02 - page with it so there might be some
68:08 - things going on here yeah I think there
68:13 - are some definitely some things going on
68:15 - here that that's probably the reason why
68:22 - we're getting the airs so it's just as
68:24 - child excellent yeah there we go
68:31 - so it's not enough that I just copied
68:35 - that over because I didn't bring over
68:39 - any of this stuff and so let's see
69:00 - I think this yep if I just bring this
69:08 - over
69:15 - I wanna see if if that will work I'm
69:21 - thinking there might be some problems
69:22 - with the with the path but it's worth a
69:28 - shot
69:36 - we'll see I don't know if it'll work
69:48 - yeah I can't put two of those in there I
69:50 - may have to leave this as a separate
69:53 - component and then just edit the
69:55 - component
70:19 - yeah so what we probably should do then
70:21 - is make a test version of this nav
70:25 - component and then we probably won't
70:31 - need a test version of the the CS file
70:35 - we can just link that CS a CS file up to
70:38 - our test component and then in our our
70:42 - main test dot master we can pull in that
70:46 - component our test main nav component
70:50 - make all our changes in that otherwise
70:54 - if we try to change the main ave s CX
70:57 - right now it will change on the live
70:59 - site so I don't want to mess with that
71:02 - so let's see let's make a copy of this
71:16 - I mean that one I'm gonna rename that
71:26 - test okay so we get main nav tests and
71:32 - now we should be able to pull this in
71:35 - let's just yeah and as long as we don't
71:48 - change that tag name we won't even have
71:49 - to change it down there so we're pulling
71:51 - in we're importing like I said I don't
71:58 - really know the correct terminology but
72:00 - in terms of like react terminology I
72:02 - guess that were used to we're importing
72:04 - this main nav test component as main nav
72:08 - so we can refer to it as main nav and we
72:14 - can remove yeah yeah so glad I didn't
72:19 - take that out so you see where we're
72:24 - pulling in that main nav right there as
72:26 - the component now let's get rid of all
72:29 - this other stuff that we pulled in that
72:32 - won't work and this I mean I think that
72:36 - was we pulled that in as well
72:42 - oops no we didn't sorry okay
72:53 - there we go so let's save that shouldn't
72:57 - we shouldn't have errors now
73:06 - all right awesome okay cool so we pulled
73:09 - that in it works let's before I stop and
73:13 - answer questions I just want to verify
73:16 - that this in fact does work by changing
73:18 - something preferably something obvious
73:21 - see you can see I had already in the
73:24 - main file I've removed all the stuff
73:26 - that goes this going on down here so
73:29 - that we could build it from scratch so
73:32 - that's why there's nothing there right
73:34 - now all right so let's let's go to that
73:39 - test file and let me I'm gonna get rid
73:45 - of that so I don't accidentally change
73:49 - anything on it and our main nav test and
73:54 - we can
74:02 - let's change something
74:07 - I was hoping there was something
74:09 - hard-coded somewhere in here
74:20 - it's nice I was green background
74:25 - yeah let's just switch it okay so the
74:31 - placeholder right now says search with
74:34 - three dots let's take out the three dots
74:37 - so search you see search with three dots
74:45 - Wow these load times are gonna annoy me
74:50 - all right see now the three dots are
74:51 - gone so that works so we did pull in a
74:54 - copy of that component that's our test
74:57 - component now we can mess with it and do
74:59 - whatever we want to it and we won't have
75:01 - to worry about messing up the live site
75:04 - just to to verify let me bring over the
75:08 - live site you can see this is the
75:10 - version with the admin stuff in but you
75:15 - can see this still has the three dots so
75:18 - now we have two completely different nav
75:21 - components being used all right well
75:28 - didn't get that much done visibly but
75:31 - got a lot done in terms of just
75:33 - understanding how this works
75:35 - so that the next time we can jump in and
75:39 - just really start messing around with
75:42 - the components and pulling things in and
75:47 - you know just kind of reworking this
75:49 - page the thing we'll have to remember is
75:52 - just to make sure that we make copies
75:55 - test versions of everything and just be
75:59 - really careful that we don't edit
76:01 - directly one of the files that's being
76:04 - imported into the main live version I
76:08 - should say they're all live but into the
76:10 - version of the site that most people see
76:13 - okay let me go to the live chat now if
76:19 - you and this portion of the stream I do
76:23 - a question and answer so if you have any
76:26 - questions put them in the live chat if
76:27 - you're not interested in the
76:28 - question-and-answer session thank you so
76:33 - much for watching totally understand if
76:36 - you get other stuff you need to do
76:38 - and I'll probably be back tomorrow
76:42 - actually there's a slight chance that I
76:45 - may take time off work to work on my
76:47 - nano degree project so if I do then
76:50 - maybe I won't be back tomorrow but we'll
76:53 - see hopefully I won't have to all right
76:59 - so I'm gonna scroll back up to the place
77:01 - where I left off at in the live chat and
77:03 - I'm just gonna go down through and try
77:05 - to get to all the questions that I can
77:08 - also let me know what you all think
77:12 - about kind of this streaming this
77:14 - project in particular I don't we talked
77:17 - yesterday briefly about it I don't
77:20 - really have you know I don't have full
77:22 - control over all the projects I need to
77:24 - work on but I could try to maybe work on
77:27 - something else during the stream if you
77:30 - think that this won't be great I I mean
77:33 - it's gonna be there's definitely gonna
77:37 - be some stuff that can be applied to any
77:39 - project like when we get into you know a
77:41 - lot of the CSS and different things I
77:44 - mean that's going to be useful
77:46 - information but things that are very
77:48 - specific to this content management
77:50 - system probably won't be that useful
77:52 - since it's not really a a widely used
77:56 - system so I don't know I'm open to it
78:02 - but at this point I don't really have
78:05 - like I don't have another like from
78:07 - scratch project that we can start from
78:09 - the beginning right now I will have some
78:11 - that I'll be working on later on
78:13 - probably but probably not so like
78:18 - towards the middle of October or
78:21 - something so for now we'll see just let
78:25 - me know what you what you think and I
78:28 - can't guarantee that I can really switch
78:30 - up what I'm doing but I can I can try
78:42 - okay John Hanson says I've always been
78:46 - curious about the render blocking CSS I
78:48 - believe much of it has to do with first
78:50 - paint and above the fold content yeah
78:56 - yeah basically if you can the way I try
79:03 - to handle it sometimes is if I can I
79:06 - pull out all the CSS necessary for that
79:09 - above the fold content and I put it in a
79:14 - style tag at the head all that other CSS
79:18 - I moved to the bottom and I just import
79:21 - it in the bottom and that seems to give
79:25 - me like a really quick initial load at
79:29 - least in terms of what users will see
79:31 - you know immediately they see they both
79:33 - fold stuff the odds of them actually
79:35 - scrolling down to try to see other stuff
79:37 - that may not be loaded yet are really
79:38 - low so that's work for me it doesn't
79:41 - work on every site sometimes you know
79:44 - bigger more complex sites it's hard to
79:47 - like really get in there and look at
79:49 - your CSS by hand and pull it out but on
79:53 - small sites I've had I've had good luck
79:57 - you know doing it that way
80:08 - breanne says hey there hey how's it
80:11 - going pretty sure I remembered to say
80:13 - your name right this time let me know if
80:16 - I didn't know bear says PHP can
80:21 - dynamically resize the picture yeah I
80:25 - could do it but the up one of the other
80:28 - things is I I can't really run I I'm
80:36 - like just really limited in what I can
80:38 - do on this server so I'm not even sure
80:40 - if I could run any PHP and actually in
80:44 - fact the department that has control of
80:48 - this server someone higher up in that
80:52 - department is actually really anti PHP
80:54 - so I probably would not have permission
80:58 - to do any PHP stuff on any of their
81:01 - servers so hmm I'll recognize I don't
81:07 - know if you can hear my phone ringing I
81:09 - do not recognize the number so I'm not
81:11 - gonna answer that just probably somebody
81:13 - trying to sell me something John Hanson
81:23 - says there's just too much on that
81:24 - homepage get the virtual scissors out
81:26 - yeah for sure
81:27 - I yeah it can definitely be cut down
81:43 - how John Hanson says that is slow yes it
81:45 - is it is very slow Patrick I'm not sure
81:53 - how to pronounce the last name but it's
81:55 - a different Patrick than the other
81:57 - person that I usually refer to as
81:58 - Patrick so I'll call I'll say Patrick
82:02 - Kay Patrick Casey says what is the
82:04 - software you're using for diagnosing i'm
82:06 - on mobile can't see the name I think I
82:10 - was just in dev tools yeah we ran she
82:12 - says was dev tool so it was just chrome
82:14 - dev tools at the time
82:23 - oh cool so no beer did mention I had
82:26 - said I got a question earlier about why
82:28 - I was in incognito mode and no beer says
82:31 - it's good for like cash problems
82:34 - sometimes you can get around that by
82:37 - using incognito mode so also a good
82:41 - reason to use it
82:58 - okay so I go says Jessie I've been
83:02 - through almost two weeks in the
83:04 - university computer science I have to
83:06 - say math sucks the dropout rate is
83:08 - incredibly high we learned to code in C
83:11 - on Linux from scratch that's my
83:13 - experience over four so far Wow
83:18 - yeah that sounds that sounds rough I
83:23 - know I'm not a big fan of math math I
83:27 - can do math I got decent grades in all
83:30 - my math classes but I just wasn't happy
83:32 - doing it code in C I haven't really done
83:37 - much with C I've seen some things done
83:40 - with C it seems like seems like things
83:44 - that you take for granted in other
83:45 - programming languages you have to do
83:48 - like manually and C and that seems like
83:51 - it would be very tedious so good swears
84:00 - the best tutorial for learning chrome
84:02 - dev tools I don't know if you check out
84:07 - the chrome the google chrome Developers
84:09 - YouTube channel
84:11 - they actually have some big people who
84:13 - have worked on chrome talked about some
84:16 - of the features so I would start there
84:18 - I'm sure there are some other tutorials
84:19 - that are that are good but that's what I
84:22 - usually watch that when a new feature
84:24 - comes out I just check out what the
84:26 - chrome developers say about it I mean
84:29 - they're usually really good at
84:30 - explaining it since they built it so
84:33 - yeah I would definitely check that out
84:42 - jonbi says in response to I ghost about
84:46 - computer science and math and everything
84:48 - is math is hard but very useful to know
84:50 - as for learning see I will say that that
84:53 - will be very very useful when you get
84:55 - into learning systems programming and
84:57 - operating systems cool yep yeah I would
85:03 - say I mean definitely hang in there
85:07 - programming is programming so even if
85:10 - you learn a lot of the basic stuff on a
85:11 - language that you might not be that
85:13 - interested in or you might not you know
85:15 - see the benefit of it all the concepts
85:18 - will transfer well to any language so
85:20 - you know whatever you end up doing later
85:23 - on it won't be a waste to have learned
85:27 - you know whatever language you're
85:29 - learning in your computer science
85:31 - program and I know a lot of computer
85:33 - science programs that I've had
85:34 - experience with will teach things in
85:37 - languages that are kind of really old
85:39 - languages and at first it seems like why
85:44 - would you teach this but as I said I
85:47 - think it's getting the concepts of
85:50 - programming down problem solving things
85:52 - that's what's what's more important
85:59 - it's like I guess is having trouble with
86:03 - the calculus calculus killed me in
86:05 - college that was it was pretty rough XE
86:12 - I ended up just barely getting a B in
86:14 - that class and the teacher was very
86:16 - lenient with me in that but yeah I was a
86:20 - business major and I was in the class
86:22 - with all math majors and so that didn't
86:25 - help either that they were just they
86:26 - just got everything and we're flying
86:28 - through all the lessons and I was like I
86:30 - haven't taken a math class in five years
86:32 - uh so uh it was kind of rough
86:44 - okay all right so there's some more
86:47 - discussion about some details of
86:49 - calculus which I'm gonna skip through a
86:51 - little bit here
87:09 - and it's
87:20 - alright sunshine - sure okay I
87:25 - rearranged you had some advice for the
87:27 - era I was getting when I was trying to
87:29 - load when I was trying to run yarn and
87:32 - load all my NPM packages so thank you
87:34 - for that I'm gonna I'll try that after
87:37 - the the streams over
87:53 - let me know beer says did you work I
87:57 - mean job or do you work I mean job so
88:00 - I'm not sure if no beer is asking me or
88:03 - somebody else because I did skip through
88:04 - a bit of all that calculus stuff so I'm
88:08 - not sure so anyway no beer let me know
88:16 - I'm not sure if you were asking that who
88:22 - you were referring to in that question
88:30 - okay Antonia said good evening the text
88:33 - is too small
88:34 - oh sorry about that was it the text I'll
88:38 - have to make this text bigger I'm get
88:40 - I'm assuming that you're talking about
88:42 - the text here although I can first
88:45 - definitely think the text on this page
88:47 - was too small which I wasn't really
88:50 - worried about because the content on the
88:52 - pages doesn't really matter to what
88:54 - we're doing but yeah but let me know if
88:57 - anyone else thinks this the text here is
89:00 - too small and I can make it bigger yeah
89:07 - I'll have to met like as you all know
89:09 - who've watched before I don't use visual
89:11 - studio code often so I don't have my
89:15 - it's not really set up the way and in a
89:22 - way that's comfortable to me yet so I
89:23 - have to get used to it
89:28 - Nova glow says can you do a video
89:31 - working with SharePoint designer I don't
89:36 - know I haven't I haven't done anything
89:38 - the SharePoint before I don't foresee
89:42 - anything in the near future that I would
89:44 - need to do on there but I if there is
89:48 - then I'll try to do video on it
90:06 - okay
90:11 - betterto says I want to clone this
90:13 - project and port to port it to MVC spar
90:22 - spar will says hi everyone
90:25 - noob here hey how's it going thanks for
90:28 - watching
90:46 - okay it looks like so Umberto has been
90:48 - having a lot of trouble with the screen
90:50 - being fuzzy I'm assuming that that's
90:53 - your connection is is anybody else
90:56 - getting low quality because the the
90:58 - stream health has been good the whole
91:00 - time and yes I mean I've been outputting
91:06 - the right number of kilobits per second
91:10 - so it should be okay but let me know
91:29 - okay onk it says so are you a freelancer
91:32 - working for the university or do you
91:34 - have a full time a full day time job
91:38 - yeah I work full-time for the University
91:41 - so I am employed full time here as a
91:44 - front-end developer I do some freelance
91:46 - work as well on the side though
92:00 - so my camera froze for a while back
92:03 - there and that tone Tony says best
92:07 - freeze face I've seen for a while it's
92:11 - usually it's like mid sneeze or
92:13 - something yeah I did notice it just
92:15 - froze again I did notice that it wasn't
92:17 - a bad freeze I was like smiling and
92:19 - somewhat looking at the camera so could
92:23 - be bad
92:24 - I gotta get this camera thing fixed
92:26 - because I could definitely see it
92:28 - freezing up and me just looking really
92:31 - silly and not realizing it all right
92:39 - Umberto's says the job I'm waiting back
92:41 - on they're going to offer it to me this
92:44 - week is to convert 14 JSP and Java
92:47 - console apps to dotnet I'm so looking
92:50 - forward to that's pretty cool
92:55 - definitely that let me know how it goes
92:58 - like if if you get the job and and how
93:01 - everything goes with that I don't really
93:03 - have experience don't anything like that
93:04 - but it sounds interesting
93:20 - no BIA says you're telling that your
93:23 - connect to FileZilla or some similar
93:25 - software yes so for this particular
93:33 - project I'm not using FileZilla I
93:35 - actually I have all the files from this
93:40 - server for the website or what's the
93:45 - word
93:46 - I can't remember so basically I'll just
93:49 - I'll show you how it works
93:50 - right I it's mounted right so this
93:55 - server is mounted to my file system so I
93:59 - can just go right in there
94:01 - I even have like let me see if I can
94:05 - find it
94:06 - [Music]
94:09 - yeah so in this case like I'm in the
94:13 - file structure for this and I can just
94:18 - go right in there right for my machine
94:20 - so that's how I'm kind of in the server
94:22 - right now the downside is I can only
94:25 - work on this site when I'm on campus
94:26 - like they have it routed I don't know
94:30 - maybe just to my IP like I I can only
94:33 - access this from this computer so even
94:38 - if I'm elsewhere on campus on a laptop I
94:39 - can't can't do it so I don't like being
94:42 - limited like that but that's kind of the
94:46 - only I seriously was working here for
94:49 - like a year and a half before I was
94:52 - allowed to even have this much access so
94:54 - I'll take it
95:11 - Harshit says should I pick Redux or mob
95:13 - X I'm confused
95:16 - birdarang xu says mob x is slightly
95:19 - easier than redux but redux is more
95:21 - popular yeah I I would agree with that
95:27 - from what I've from what I've seen from
95:30 - using redux and from tutorials on mob X
95:32 - I think mob X is a little bit easier
95:42 - okay Umberto says he just got to the ass
95:46 - pronunciation it says it still
95:49 - pronounced as it as its acronym as far
95:51 - as I can tell
95:52 - ASP but I would just stick to calling it
95:55 - dotnet alright I'll just I'll try to
95:57 - remember that and just call it dotnet
95:59 - from now on all right it's always hard
96:02 - about pronunciation when you work by I
96:05 - mean I basically work alone most of the
96:07 - time so I only read normally about how
96:11 - to pronounce things unless I can find
96:12 - somebody on YouTube that says it so I
96:15 - just kind of the first time you read it
96:18 - you got to decide in your head well how
96:20 - am I gonna pronounce this thing and
96:21 - that's usually what what sticks
96:44 - a Peter S Mac versus windows I'll say
96:49 - this is my answer for the operating
96:52 - system question I develop on a Mac my
96:57 - servers or Linux and I game on a PC or
97:01 - on a Windows computer so that's that's
97:05 - how I feel about about operating systems
97:16 - okay Harshit says any plans for review
97:19 - I'm getting into it nowadays I don't
97:23 - have any plans to review right now I'm
97:26 - interested in it if you want to learn
97:28 - more about view I would check out
97:31 - there's a series that we just did here
97:33 - free code camp not me I mean but Cody
97:37 - does videos and he just did I think it's
97:44 - like a five-part series I think there
97:45 - are five parts there might act there
97:47 - might end up being more than that of
97:49 - building something in view from the very
97:52 - beginning all the way through so I would
97:55 - check that out I haven't watched it yet
97:59 - but it seems like it's getting a lot of
98:02 - views and a lot of thumbs up and stuff
98:04 - so it seems like it's it's been well
98:06 - received so far
98:23 - Harshit says do you use zsh in your
98:26 - terminal no I just have the the Bosch
98:35 - just use Bosch for the terminal I mean
98:40 - like my terminal client is I turned 2
98:43 - but in terms of like my probe profile
98:49 - and everything I think that's what
98:50 - you're asking so let me know if it's not
98:54 - haha John B says oh the great
98:56 - pronunciation words I'm still a fan of
98:58 - the ever looming war of SQL vs sequel I
99:04 - prefer sequel when it comes to that
99:07 - unless or why I prefer sequel but I
99:10 - usually do say sequel but I hear SQL a
99:13 - lot yeah I don't know why we worry so
99:21 - much about pronouncing these acronyms
99:23 - like does it really matter and as long
99:29 - as you know what the other person is
99:31 - talking about I don't I don't know that
99:33 - it matters all right well I've gotten to
99:38 - the bottom of the live chat if I happen
99:40 - to miss your question I apologize you
99:43 - can send me a message on Twitter or
99:46 - comment on the video or something and
99:48 - I'll try to get to your question I
99:52 - should be back tomorrow like I said
99:57 - there's a chance that I may not stream
99:59 - tomorrow and I may be working on my my
100:02 - Redux project so yeah oh I may be
100:09 - working on it it's given me a lot of
100:11 - trouble so far so hopefully hopefully a
100:16 - tomorrow I can stream and say hey I
100:18 - finished my project and I turned it in
100:19 - so the chances of that right now don't
100:22 - seem really good but I can hope right so
100:27 - I'll be back probably tomorrow I'll let
100:30 - you know I'll send out a tweet tomorrow
100:31 - and I'll schedule the stream
100:33 - as early as I can so you get two
100:34 - notifications on YouTube if you're
100:36 - subscribed but until then have a great
100:42 - day and thanks for so much thank you so
100:44 - much for watching and contributing in
100:47 - the live chat and I really appreciate it

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie today we're gonna start on an entirely new project so we're we may not be finished with the last project we might come back to it but right now there's just not a lot going on with it and the things that remain to be done there are other things that we've done before sometimes multiple times on the stream or they're just not really a big deal so I don't know that they were streaming but today I want to kind of get you familiarized with the site that will be working on probably for for the rest of the month and just kind of let you know some of the background if you're interested I did do some videos where we were trying to fix this site a bit before so this is on my my youtube channel so there's a link in the description but the video that's first ever live coding session it I talked about this website in there I'm pretty sure let's see the quality yeah so the max quality is 720p and I think the font size is too small so it was my first session so I was kind of messing things up a bit but you can still hear me so you can get an idea of what's going on with this but I'm gonna try to summarize everything and what we're trying to accomplish so it's not necessary that you go back and watch that but if you wanted more info I think maybe this video and maybe the next two two or three live streams after are about this site and this is a site that I'm that we're working on it this is a public site so Franciscan edu and it's slow so there's other things wrong with the site but for today we're gonna focus on how slow it is I ran a page speed test earlier and this is what we got 29 out of 100 which is good compared to what it was so when I earlier this year I had some time to work on this site and the score was actually one so I'll have to find a screenshot a pretty shot took a screenshot of it this is the lowest score I've ever seen if I can find that I'll show you all but I'm pretty sure it was it was one and yeah so it's better than it was but there's still a lot so you can see some are easy things like just image reducing image sizes compressing images some are things that are a little bit more difficult and some things we won't be able to change we'll just kind of have to work with it so things like server response time I don't really have access to anything with the server right now this it's a whole different department where I work that handles that so I won't directly be able to change anything I can try to work with the other department though to get some things change so as you can see in this particular test server response time was 1.1 seconds that's not good I've seen it as high as seven seconds with this server and yeah so it doesn't matter how fast we make this site we still have to deal with this server response time so hopefully I can do something about that or at least talk to people who can do something about that also my camera keeps freezing so I will I'll try to fix it I don't know what the problem is but I came in today and it was it wasn't working so there's some command that I can type in to get it to work but it's only working temporarily so let's see all right let me let me go to the live chat quickly just to say hi before we get started hey everybody Oh is there Joseph says there's an apple event going on my streaming doing it during an event I've done this before I should pay more attention to what's going on but if I don't have a lot of people I'm gonna blame it on that but actually it looks like there's a lot of people right now I mean more than more than usual so yeah today we're going to work with some stuff that we are we've never worked with before so in particular this this site was built with a content management system called Ektron and that system is based off of dotnet framework and so there's some csharp stuff I don't know how much we're gonna get into csharp today but we will get into it at some point so we made we may start looking at it I don't know how much we're actually gonna edit let's see John B said no longer camerashy yeah I'm trying this out I'm trying the camera thing uhhuh John B says I reach your camera a twenty nine out of 100 would can I look and I improve is it the quality or is it my face I'm not all right cool so let's get started I always forget to do this at the beginning but if you're just watching for the first time though this stream is just about me doing my everyday work so it's not necessarily a tutorial although I try to explain things as I along and there are a lot of people in the live chat that are very helpful answering questions but I just want other developers to see what it's like for me to do my job I don't know if I'm an average developer or not I don't really know if my workflow is is the norm but I thought it would be useful if other people especially maybe people who work on their own or who are just kind of starting out could you see what it's like for me see how many mistakes I make and how I've worked through that and so that's so that's what we're doing here so if you do see a lot of mistakes if it seems like it's unscripted that's kind of the point so it's not scripted and I will make mistakes so that said let's get to it I like to organize the streams with Pomodoro timer so I'll do 25 minutes of coding or you know whatever kind of whatever we happen to be doing it's not always code like right now we're gonna be going through some of the site speed things but I'm gonna do that for 25 minutes so I'll take a fiveminute break and I'll go through the live chat and answer any questions you have and then we'll just repeat today we'll probably do two Pomodoro sessions I'd like to like to keep this dream a little bit short I'm still working on that react nanodegree and I have a project a Redux project due by Friday and it is not done yet so I need to work on it so that's why I don't want to do a really long stream I want to get done and work on it a little bit a little bit more okay so I'm just going to start with some explanation of what the site is what's what's wrong with it what we're gonna try to change hopefully you know by the end of September we'll see how much we can get done all right so this is the site the main site for the university that I work at I'm a frontend developer for Franciscan University this site was built before I started working here I think it it's a three years old in terms of when it was launched it's about three years but in terms of development it's pushing four years I think because the site was built and went underwent a lot of testing and things so it's about four years old and it's definitely in need of some bigger updates than we're gonna handle this month but the completely redesigning everything from the ground up is going to be a project that's going to come hopefully within the next year but not not right now so right now we're just going to try to make the best of what we have all right and what we have as I mentioned earlier is a site built off the Ektron content management system if you've never heard of ektron then I'm not surprised because I never heard of ektron before I started here and it's it's a challenging content management system to work with luckily I don't have to do that much with it there are other people in my department who handle most of the content management with that and I don't usually have to deal deal with it directly but right now we've already showed you the the site speed rating and if you wanted to look at this in more detail you could just run the site speed test yourself on the site but the first thing that we're definitely going to be able to do is we're gonna be able to compress some of these images but even better than that what I think we can do is actually get rid of some images so let's see browser caching I don't know that I can do anything about the caching so things that I can't do anything about I'm gonna hide we can try to eliminate the render blocking JavaScript and CSS I'll show you in a minute what we're kind of what we're dealing with here in terms of how this gets put into you know by Extron you know how things get put together so I don't have complete control over over all the files some of them are created dynamically and just put in here and there but we'll do the best we can you see this there's quite a few files being loaded here can't do anything directly about the server response time and we're gonna try to fix this you know prioritize visible content but that's that's going to need we need to do some work also when it comes to minifying the JavaScript I I can't minify a lot of these directly because I don't know where they're coming in at so that's one of the bad things about Extron is there's not really an exxon community like if this was WordPress I'd probably find 500 articles about how something works probably more with Ektron not so much the company that made Ektron originally got bought out by another company so I'm not even sure it what the support is like with Exxon anymore and then minify HTML probably won't be able to minify the HTML and uh if you're if you're wondering why we can't do certain things it'll be a little bit more clear in a minute although I know some of you are good with csharp Sarno Umberto's good with csharp so maybe some things that I don't think I can do right now maybe we can do and I just don't don't know how so anyway that's what we're dealing with the biggest images on the page are obviously the images in this slider and they all load so these there's no lazy loading going on here all these images load and they're all pretty big now obviously they need to be a certain size if it's gonna be you know a large slider like this but some images are actually really big and they don't need to be like this image is one of the largest images on the page but it's tiny right so there's little things like that that we can change and that really the the people who are updating this site through the content management system need to be aware of the size of images that they're putting in and making sure that they compress the images so we'll handle that I don't want to do too much compression and things and image resizing on the stream because I don't think that's it's just not really exciting stuff it might be worth it just to go over how I do it but I don't want to go through a ton of images and do you know resizing and things some of the images I think we can get rid of are these I don't think that we need these here and these are these images are pretty big so each one of these sections we could probably take the images out completely we want to make sure I did go through a few months ago and made sure these images were the correct size and compressed but it's possible that you know some new ones have been uploaded so we want to double check that the same way this image changes frequently so we want to double check to make sure that image is is working correctly I know the user interface wise there's a ton of stuff I want to change with this user interface but the first thing that I want to worry about is the the load times because if if the page takes too long to load and someone doesn't even stick around to see it then it doesn't matter how nice it looks it could be the best looking site ever made but if it takes you know 50 seconds to load no one's gonna see it all right so let me see if there's ice want to see if there's any questions quickly in the live chat about you know but before we actually start to dig into some of the some of the code so I'm just going to quickly kind of scroll through this and see if there's any questions related to the site okay all right cool it looks like nothing related to this site although John Hanson does say if you do a Google page speed test they'll actually give you the compressed files to download the images yeah that's true I'm glad you mentioned that I'm see where they are at the bottom yeah so you can download we do a page speed test you can download all your compressed resources so I have used some of these before so we may we may get some of these for the images I have I use image magic on the command line and I have I'm able to get better compression than I can get from these also we're gonna need to resize some of them as well but it'll probably be useful to grab some of this JavaScript and CSS at some point you know we could benefit ourselves but if it's already done for us then you know why not use it all right so we're just gonna deal with the home page for now obviously that gets the most visitors and it's also the page that takes the longest by far to load so some of the Interior pages aren't quite as bad for load times so we'll see how it goes if I don't think we'll get this you know to where we really want it in the amount of time that we have but if we if we do we'll move on maybe in work on some interior pages I'm gonna be using sue I want to bring this over so it's closer all right there we go I want to bring I want to show you my Trello board as well so I do have a Trello board that I already made a few months ago just a lot of things that I thought could be done to help with load time so you know we're gonna we're gonna go through some of these we don't have to come up with everything you know on our own right now so you know a basic stuff minify these files but some of the things are actually redoing the UI so that we can get away with not having so many images or we can completely get rid of some pieces of code that for whatever reason are slowing things down a bit this is the file that we're going to be working with mostly as you can see I'm actually using Visual Studio code so I know we always have peeps someone always asks about my code editors so it's Visual Studio code this time and not Adam so I have we're mainly going to be working in this file although you can see there's a lot of different things linked into this file so we're gonna have to dig into some of these other files as well but this is a copy of the the template that is used for the home page so we'll do everything in the copy so we don't mess up the home page and when we get it to a point where it's it's good we like it then we can just copy it over or change the name and use that instead for the home page so just kind of scrolling through quickly up here we're importing so it's actually it's not it's not really that in terms of organization and what's going on there there's some similarities to what we're doing with react right we're importing a lot of other great components I don't know what the terminology is for extra honor for for.net framework stuff but in terms of the terminology that we've been using with react you know we're importing components up here and then down here we're mixing HTML with some of these other try to find it okay with some of these these tags here right so we can put in you know these things that we've imported up there we put them in with these tags and we pass props to them right so it's it's really a lot like react components it just at least superficially I have no idea what's going on behind the scenes and whether it's comparable to react but at least you know so the we can reason about it that's basically what it is and I'm probably gonna still use react terminology because like I said I don't really know what the exon terminology is for this stuff and I don't really care to learn it since we're not gonna be using it for that much longer anyway so let's go into let's go in into the the code is controlling this this carousel here so this is kind of like the hero section carousel I want to get rid of it I want it to be completely gone right this that seems to me like it'll have the biggest immediate impact on load times out of anything else that I could do or at least that I could easily do because these are the largest images I get rid of one oops actually it's not even some weird stuff going on there's they're like three or four images I think four images so four large images on the page can be gone we'll get rid of that and we'll also get rid of these so basically the eighthlargest images on the page we're gonna get rid of I think that's gonna have a huge impact also wouldn't be a bad idea to just do just a baseline to see what our load times are so let's just check out I'm gonna change my network conditions here and throttle it let's go with let's go with a fast 3G and see what it's like on Fast 3G I like to slow it down just so that I get a better idea of what it's like for people with slower connections and also you can kind of see things loading when it's a slower connection so I'm just gonna refresh and we'll see see what we get you see how slow that was right like waiting for the response and the network that was really slow all right so we're still waiting I mean at this point it's the page is usable but not everything is loaded yet so you scroll down it's pretty much everything was loaded we're still waiting on some of these images okay are we done now yeah all right total load time thirty five point seven five seconds so almost 36 seconds total load time right obviously the page was usable you could see content a lot earlier than that but you know you still had this little thing you know go on up here or whatever it does with Chrome a humph for for 36 seconds that's crazy that's I don't know I don't know let you but to me that's just really slow so let's let's just see what took the longest all right let's see what the biggest files were so we have an image okay this is up there and that in the slider but I think that's the main image there and then we have okay this is the one with the president the university this one is that image that's that's here that's really small that should not be this big right where this image is 370 kilobytes it's crazy that first image one point three megabytes that's completely unacceptable okay as we go down it gets better but as as usual your biggest files or images that's I mean unless you have video on your site your biggest files are probably always going to be images you can see we are loading some bigger JavaScript files so jQuery UI completes right I wonder if we really need that or if we need we need everything there I'm interested to see if that's okay at least it's minified that's that's good that's crazy that it's still that big even minified though we'd see these anything that says banner those are those big sections here right so they're kind of towards the top as well we want to get rid of that okay it looks like there's there's no surprises I was kind of looking for something up towards the top that would just be you know really big but it's not not bad I mean I expected it with the images so so that's definitely I think where we need to goodness 24 seconds for that Wow that's where we need to look first that's we're gonna have the biggest impact okay oh I did I just looked over the live chat quickly and I noticed that my camera stops I'm resetting that again if anybody ever has it has had issues with an iMac camera just all of a sudden not working right like the little green light just goes black and bright in the middle of me doing stuff it's right on the main screen hmm excuse me it's yawning my secondary screen I haven't had any problems with that but the angle is weird so you just see like the side of my face the whole time so anyway I'll probably end up getting a like a USB webcam at some point so it shouldn't be a problem for that much longer but for now it's just a little annoyance but I also saw Nova blow asked why I'm in incognito mode because I I'm an administrator for this site it automatically logs me in and I don't really want to lock myself out on when I'm using Chrome not in incognito mode and other files get loaded and so I don't want to mess with the administrator type you know files that get for the UI for the admins I just want to see what other people see so that's why I'm doing it in incognito mode it also allows me to switch right over it so I usually have the same site open in normally in Chrome with the admin features there so I can switch over and change things really quick without having to log in and log back out every time I look at this site I just see more things that I don't want to fix and change okay so let me show you if we're gonna take this out we need to replace it with something right we can't just completely remove it that would look kind of weird let me show you what I'm thinking of for the replacement yeah sorry yawning again I don't know what's going on I don't think I brought it over yet but still be on my other screen all right so let me show you what I'm thinking so this this obviously when you see it you're gonna know why I'm saying this obviously isn't gonna be what we put in here but just kind of the basic structure is gonna be more what we use so let me try to do as much of side by side as I can so right now you see this is the the header here's our menus not not really a fan of this too much here's what I'd like to to move it to and this should look at least somewhat familiar since this kind of the same style is what we used on our last project but I'd like to switch over to this I think I'll take this logo out and use our new logo that we used on our last project when I did this before I don't think I had the new logo yet so that will change but you'd see I've moved the header I move some stuff around on the header I think it looks looks more clean I've had actually added some of the social media icons so I think it looks a lot nicer I Shrunk the search search bar a bit and added a lot of things in the sidebar so you can see all those menu items are still there but now they've moved over over here okay and we have search over there as well if you're interested in how I did this check out those videos on my channel that I showed you at the beginning because I do go through a lot of how I did this header and how I did this this background so it's it's really simple I mean it's a simple like parallax style background but I'm thinking right now we have four big images and sometimes we have even more images on here just depends on how many are uploaded at any given time so we'll go from that down to one large image so we'll still have a hero section we just won't have all those images so this is just a stock photo obviously we also have and you can see I didn't finish this right we have a spot for you know for some text a calltoaction button right and then below obviously I haven't read I haven't finished this but you can see I've gone with a fullwidth wow that's weird that's really weird I haven't seen that happen before hmm that's crazy I've honestly never seen that happen oh is that I don't know what I'm I don't know what happened there I guess I turned off that that's server yeah all right oh that's why so I I didn't have any of my NPM modules installed for that project and so my gulp server wasn't running so anyway I'm gonna I'm installing things on my other screen here so but did you get the idea of kind of what I want to do is just kind of redesign this section here so I can get rid of these images I'm also gonna be able to get rid of a lot of these images as well so look we have you know we have more images here and it'll clean things up there and I mean we're gonna get rid of at least a dozen images so definitely gonna be it's gonna be a lot more light wait and see looks like for some reason my my install fails all right then so I'm getting some area that I've never seen before I'll give it another shot see if it works not really a big deal we can still do a lot of this without mmm just own that again shoot okay so my um my timer went up so now is a good time this to break for five minutes I'll go over the live chat and then while I'm doing that let's see yes I'll bring this over to so y'all can see what's going on here all right so check that out I'm in tonight hopefully you won't see the air again but if it comes up you'll see it don't ya so all right so I may just have to that's really weird I just have to check that out later on all right so I'm going to scroll up a bit and I'm gonna go through the live chat answer questions for five minutes and then we'll go back and try to actually get changed some things on this page okay Michael will Avila says give me a shout out so actually just shut up anyway so there's a shout out so thanks for watching thanks for for being involved in the live chat all right Patrick says he sharp for the win not but I hear dotnet core 2 is really fast as opposed to older dotnet tech yeah unfortunately this is older dog net tech so so not to me working with the new cool stuff yet yeah all right I'm just I'm still scrolling through trying to find some questions here in the live chat okay so des es says just starting out and want to get in the IT world is frontend or backend the best or ideal way to go I think it honestly depends on what you're interested in I don't know I guess I've I've seen or either read about examples of people starting with either frontend or backend and then sometimes they moved to they switch sometimes they go full stack I don't know it really does depend on what you're more interested in as to where you want to start out you could always switch yeah I guess it would be hard to answer you know in general from what I've seen and this is you know I've not studied this you know but just from like casually observing it does seem like salaries for backend are slightly higher than for frontend but I don't know if that's just if that's true across the board or you know just the few times I've noticed it so I don't know that could be a factor for you rune grin shoe says learn front end stuff somewhat well then learn backend then combine and improve join B says depends on if you prefer working with routing and networking or if you prefer working with design and user interfaces frontend is UI backend is routing a networking Verito says I don't think I'm ever gonna be very good at frontend design just not something I'm very interested in or good at for that matter yeah I'm Berto I would say if you're not interested in it then there's really probably not much reason to try to try to work on it but if you did want to get better at it I think it's one of those things that it's takes time right it takes a long time to just get that I to look at something and say and I'm not saying I have this perfectly but just comparing myself to where I was like let's say five years ago to be able to look at a website and immediately start to pick out places where the design could be improved whether there's just obvious things or to be able to look at a blank page and just start to visualize where everything would go I that just takes a lot of time of being exposed to it I don't know I kind of think that you get all this information in your brain from seeing so many websites and trying to think critically about them and then at some point it's just it just kind of happens naturally all right it's not like it seems like you're just good at it but I don't think it's the case that people are just good I think it's that your brain gradually gets used to picking those things out so anyway that's just my my take on it all right I'm going to go back and do some more coding I said we're gonna do one more Pomodoro session and then then I'll answer the rest of the questions and let's see I will say I do want to give a little elaborate a little bit more on what I was just talking about especially for people who are just starting out I I've seen and maybe you all have seen this recently there's a like a little comic that I've seen online too where somebody's a writer there's two people talking to each other and the one one person is saying you know I how do I get to be a better writer like I'm still no good I think it's writing and maybe it's an artist I don't remember but he's asking someone more experienced and a more experienced person just as like just keep practicing and the person says well what I've been practicing look at all the stuff I've done and it shows a pile of work you know pile of papers and the other person's I think says something like well we'll just just keep going and that you see their pile and it's huge like you know it's it's way bigger than the other pile so I think it's kind of the same thing when it comes to coding it can be applied to that that and and I don't think it's just like a design thing or a frontend thing I think it's any area it just takes a ton of practice before you start to get really good at it and again I'm not claiming that I'm even at that point of being really good at it there's definitely a lot of things that I'm Way better at than I used to be but there's certainly more room for improvement and I always likes like sports metaphors sometimes are easy sometimes easier to think about it in terms of like a physical activity because the results are just so obvious right in front of you but I know they used to tell me when I played American football and in high school the more you practice so I was I was a quarterback and they said the more you throw the more you you get to see what's going on in the field from you that quarterbacks perspective things they'd say it would they would slow down right so initially like when you're trying to find if someone the receiver is open to throw the ball to it just looks crazy and confusing but you just have to do it so many times and eventually your brain you get so used to it it doesn't seem as chaotic it slows down right and so I think it's it's the same way like you look at code and it's not just this jumble of mess you see what's going on you can follow the flow of it you look at a website design it you see what should which should be there so anyway that was meant to be like somewhat encouraging that like if you're not there yet don't feel like there's something wrong with you you just need to keep going although I guess you could take it as daunting as well thinking like wow I'm gonna I'm gonna have to do the ton of work but anyway let's get back to this also I did have an issue all this morning I was working on this bug and I just want to share with you in case somebody runs into a similar situation maybe it'll save you a lot of time so I was sending form data to a Google sheet and then saving it in a spreadsheet and emailing it from there but what I was doing I was taking the form data and serializing it and then sending it well one of the pieces of data was the value of a text area and occasionally we wouldn't get all the data it would cut off in the middle of what someone was trying to send and right obviously that's a problem because we wouldn't get all the information that we needed and I could not figure it out and I was trying to figure out what browsers it was and testing on different browsers and trying to look things up couldn't find any information on text areas getting cut off finally I went back in and looked exactly at where everything was getting cut off and it was getting cut off right at a point where they were using and so they were using an ampersand and when a date is serialized it just dropped everything after that because it assumed everything after that was was like part of the next piece of data so I had actually just went through and before I sent it before I see I realized that I went through and changed all ampersands to two and so a and B and I put it in there so that was the fake so if anybody ever has data being dropped like that and you're from forums maybe it's that check check that out so I don't know why I never thought about that when I was first doing that that form but really glad I found it snakes that I had to spend so much time to find it but it feels good when you find out the solution to to a bug so anyway not related to this project but could be helpful for someone oops all right so I said something's wrong with this I did have this running in basically I had it I had it in a different directory so everything that I had done before was a branch on another git repo and I wanted to make it its own get repo so I moved basically I moved it over a copy and pasted a bunch of stuff I initialized a new git repo and then for whatever reason now it's not it's not working right so I'll have to that's why it did work before and we could see it at first but now I'll have to work on that okay so let's go in now what we need to do we need to find where the data is being pulled in for this header and where it's being pulled in for this as well right because it's not most of the stuff is not directly in that master template it's in one of the components that are being imported so we're gonna have to do a little bit of digging and this file structure is not it's not well organized this this file structure has been worked on by multiple people over years before I even got here and so it's a little bit it's a little bit crazy just as an example we have all these different configs and they're named original config original older config this is actually another copy called web may 7 text and it's it's a text file but it's just a copy of the config right so there's not even a standard like naming convention or anything so it makes it a little bit difficult to find things but at least we'll have we'll have some hints here because we can look at what's being imported here okay so main nav I if I had to guess I'd say main nav was probably that navbar that we're looking for let me know if this the font is too small for you I can make it bigger and let's see hmm we'll probably need we need to actually I'm not gonna bring in so I think we can strike a balance between things that we pull in that that it's data from the from the content management system and things that we can hard code in I'm not opposed to hard coding in this case because we're this is just a kind of a temporary thing to make the site a little bit more bearable until we can redo the site so things that are not likely to change like our social media URLs I have no problem at all hard coding those so could probably safely just get rid of this at some point hard code the social media links and those aren't gonna change but let's try to find this main nav and I do want to scroll down to the point where that nav comes in at to see if I want to see where that that slider is is is coming in it as well so let's scroll down a bit we're still at some strip things so you see there's a lot of different just as we scroll there's a lot of different JavaScript stuff going on things being being imported different places so we can mess around with this and try to move them around for you try to move them around a bit see if we can increase load of times just by maybe pulling in some of this stuff you down at the bottom okay all right okay oh and the utility now this is interesting so it looks like a few of these knobs are kind of put together so we may need to work on all of them okay so that's the top section now this is where okay all right so everything that's that's between the footer and the header is all in a difference a different component okay let's go check out that that Navin so we'll go to user controls main of all right we can look this will probably be faster there we go all right so I mean okay look say we got some jQuery going on at the top for the search for the search box which we should be able to get rid of most of it okay here we go yeah we're in the right spot now we can see the different the different links here actually we could see and this is kind of odd when I first looked at this I was not sure what was going on but here's what what happens so we can see all this HTML and it looks like this stuff is hardcoded but at some point it pulls in the data from the content management system so all this hardcoded stuff up here doesn't really mean anything this is what's important and this is basically our components and then props are getting passed in after data is being pulled from the content management system so this is what we need to worry about and this is what I wanted to see because what we want to do we're going to totally change you know the HTML of that header to make it match what we're doing with our header and our side nav so I want to be able to grab these and input them in and I need to figure out so okay that's you know what are they doing here obviously if this was react right I'd I'd be pulling in data and mapping over it and things like that well I'm not exactly sure how to do that and with this so it seems like we can use this repeater and that will loop through everything so there's definitely some stuff going on that I'm just like I'm not sure about but how do we have nested item templates here what does that even see so there's weird stuff that I'm just not not entirely sure what's going on with that Wow that is a very long string of data there okay I'd say what I ought to do then is bring in actually I'm gonna look at the live chat quickly to see because I know there's some of you that use that possibly could be more familiar with this just going to check briefly okay I'm there to asked if this was there's a repo I think I think I saw that somewhere now I can't find it again Oh a lot of this stuff isn't a private repo right now I can probably pull some of it at least some of it I think could be in a public repo repo yeah it would just have to be limited yeah I'll have to double check and see what just to make sure like you know cuz there's a config file and stuff in here that has like database passwords and things so I'll have to double check and see what's actually committed to the repo and if I can make it public also someone was talking about errors okay lose john john hanson saying there are 71 errors on that page browsers will have have to perform error correction wait there are 71 airs on tweets on this page 379 airs are we talking about something else okay Tom asked what is a SC X to be honest with you I don't know what it stands for but basically these are these are templates so if you want to think in JavaScript terms and react terms this is kind of like if you had a dot JSX file and I mean that's really a loose comparison right because I'm admittedly I'm not really familiar with this so I'm not I'm just trying to learn as much as I I can as much as I have to to make these changes so it's going to be a lot of trial and error but I imagine this is not this is not that uncommon that you would come into a project that was already existing projects kind of like a legacy thing and I have to work with it and not really have a lot of freedom to change things drastically so that's what you know that's what we're gonna have to do so what I want to do right here I think is copy and paste a bunch of this stuff and then I don't know about this search right now I didn't really want to bring in all this this jQuery but maybe I'll bring I'm not worried about the search right now I can bring that in later but let's let's pull in I have to find that that other template or was it there yeah okay so usually I want to pull in all right i need's need to format this it's easier to read so let's just it format is HTML for now okay okay so this is where we were pulling in Main Ave so let's comment that out for now and then put some of this in here and let's see what it does and I need to figure out I need to figure out what URL this test page is at I don't remember okay cool so we have an answer so ASC X is the file extension for asp.net or asp.net not really sure how you're supposed to pronounce it but I'm going to say ask because that seems like it would be faster says basically a scx makes it files make it easy to use the same code across multiple asp.net web pages cool alright let's I can't remember tents sorry everyone I cannot remember what the URL is for the test version of this because I made it in at the beginning of this year and I haven't been on it for a long time so let's see I'm gonna look it up here so on my other screen I'm in the content management system I don't want to show you this right now because I don't want to show something that shouldn't be on like in terms of May there might be content that's scheduled to be released that shouldn't be public yet I don't really know I don't use this often enough to even know if that's if that's a thing but just in case okay I was close all right cool so I got it so here's here's the page and you all can go to this this is public Franciscan ddu slash home test and we've got an error which is cool I kind of expected we get some air because we just copy and paste at a ton of stuff that to be honest with you I didn't completely understand anyway just you know million Li because of the syntax that I want it used to but let's see we're line 352 line 352 so there's this that's the first line that we actually put put this in so let's get rid of a lot of this stuff oops okay let's get rid of that since that was all I can see now that this looks like it was commented out anyway alright now let's see if we can figure out why that's not working we have I'd say that see and in case you you notice this we are in fact cowboy coding right now so there really is not a test version of this site I can't do anything about that that's just I know that that's that's not good but there's supposed to be a beta version of this site but unfortunately it shares all the same files I'm not really sure I think it has a different database but all the files are the same so if I go to change a file for the test version it also changes things on the live version so for our purposes we're editing the live version of the site and there's not really anything that that I can do about that okay let me check again sis's okay the name Chow has taxonomy does not exist in the current context alright so probably you copy something over whoops hmm I lost some other file let's split this let's check out there we go shrink that give us a little bit more space I don't think I clicked on the wrong thing there we go there actually let me see this as well this each dot aspx page has this dot CS page with it so there might be some things going on here yeah I think there are some definitely some things going on here that that's probably the reason why we're getting the airs so it's just as child excellent yeah there we go so it's not enough that I just copied that over because I didn't bring over any of this stuff and so let's see I think this yep if I just bring this over I wanna see if if that will work I'm thinking there might be some problems with the with the path but it's worth a shot we'll see I don't know if it'll work yeah I can't put two of those in there I may have to leave this as a separate component and then just edit the component yeah so what we probably should do then is make a test version of this nav component and then we probably won't need a test version of the the CS file we can just link that CS a CS file up to our test component and then in our our main test dot master we can pull in that component our test main nav component make all our changes in that otherwise if we try to change the main ave s CX right now it will change on the live site so I don't want to mess with that so let's see let's make a copy of this I mean that one I'm gonna rename that test okay so we get main nav tests and now we should be able to pull this in let's just yeah and as long as we don't change that tag name we won't even have to change it down there so we're pulling in we're importing like I said I don't really know the correct terminology but in terms of like react terminology I guess that were used to we're importing this main nav test component as main nav so we can refer to it as main nav and we can remove yeah yeah so glad I didn't take that out so you see where we're pulling in that main nav right there as the component now let's get rid of all this other stuff that we pulled in that won't work and this I mean I think that was we pulled that in as well oops no we didn't sorry okay there we go so let's save that shouldn't we shouldn't have errors now all right awesome okay cool so we pulled that in it works let's before I stop and answer questions I just want to verify that this in fact does work by changing something preferably something obvious see you can see I had already in the main file I've removed all the stuff that goes this going on down here so that we could build it from scratch so that's why there's nothing there right now all right so let's let's go to that test file and let me I'm gonna get rid of that so I don't accidentally change anything on it and our main nav test and we can let's change something I was hoping there was something hardcoded somewhere in here it's nice I was green background yeah let's just switch it okay so the placeholder right now says search with three dots let's take out the three dots so search you see search with three dots Wow these load times are gonna annoy me all right see now the three dots are gone so that works so we did pull in a copy of that component that's our test component now we can mess with it and do whatever we want to it and we won't have to worry about messing up the live site just to to verify let me bring over the live site you can see this is the version with the admin stuff in but you can see this still has the three dots so now we have two completely different nav components being used all right well didn't get that much done visibly but got a lot done in terms of just understanding how this works so that the next time we can jump in and just really start messing around with the components and pulling things in and you know just kind of reworking this page the thing we'll have to remember is just to make sure that we make copies test versions of everything and just be really careful that we don't edit directly one of the files that's being imported into the main live version I should say they're all live but into the version of the site that most people see okay let me go to the live chat now if you and this portion of the stream I do a question and answer so if you have any questions put them in the live chat if you're not interested in the questionandanswer session thank you so much for watching totally understand if you get other stuff you need to do and I'll probably be back tomorrow actually there's a slight chance that I may take time off work to work on my nano degree project so if I do then maybe I won't be back tomorrow but we'll see hopefully I won't have to all right so I'm gonna scroll back up to the place where I left off at in the live chat and I'm just gonna go down through and try to get to all the questions that I can also let me know what you all think about kind of this streaming this project in particular I don't we talked yesterday briefly about it I don't really have you know I don't have full control over all the projects I need to work on but I could try to maybe work on something else during the stream if you think that this won't be great I I mean it's gonna be there's definitely gonna be some stuff that can be applied to any project like when we get into you know a lot of the CSS and different things I mean that's going to be useful information but things that are very specific to this content management system probably won't be that useful since it's not really a a widely used system so I don't know I'm open to it but at this point I don't really have like I don't have another like from scratch project that we can start from the beginning right now I will have some that I'll be working on later on probably but probably not so like towards the middle of October or something so for now we'll see just let me know what you what you think and I can't guarantee that I can really switch up what I'm doing but I can I can try okay John Hanson says I've always been curious about the render blocking CSS I believe much of it has to do with first paint and above the fold content yeah yeah basically if you can the way I try to handle it sometimes is if I can I pull out all the CSS necessary for that above the fold content and I put it in a style tag at the head all that other CSS I moved to the bottom and I just import it in the bottom and that seems to give me like a really quick initial load at least in terms of what users will see you know immediately they see they both fold stuff the odds of them actually scrolling down to try to see other stuff that may not be loaded yet are really low so that's work for me it doesn't work on every site sometimes you know bigger more complex sites it's hard to like really get in there and look at your CSS by hand and pull it out but on small sites I've had I've had good luck you know doing it that way breanne says hey there hey how's it going pretty sure I remembered to say your name right this time let me know if I didn't know bear says PHP can dynamically resize the picture yeah I could do it but the up one of the other things is I I can't really run I I'm like just really limited in what I can do on this server so I'm not even sure if I could run any PHP and actually in fact the department that has control of this server someone higher up in that department is actually really anti PHP so I probably would not have permission to do any PHP stuff on any of their servers so hmm I'll recognize I don't know if you can hear my phone ringing I do not recognize the number so I'm not gonna answer that just probably somebody trying to sell me something John Hanson says there's just too much on that homepage get the virtual scissors out yeah for sure I yeah it can definitely be cut down how John Hanson says that is slow yes it is it is very slow Patrick I'm not sure how to pronounce the last name but it's a different Patrick than the other person that I usually refer to as Patrick so I'll call I'll say Patrick Kay Patrick Casey says what is the software you're using for diagnosing i'm on mobile can't see the name I think I was just in dev tools yeah we ran she says was dev tool so it was just chrome dev tools at the time oh cool so no beer did mention I had said I got a question earlier about why I was in incognito mode and no beer says it's good for like cash problems sometimes you can get around that by using incognito mode so also a good reason to use it okay so I go says Jessie I've been through almost two weeks in the university computer science I have to say math sucks the dropout rate is incredibly high we learned to code in C on Linux from scratch that's my experience over four so far Wow yeah that sounds that sounds rough I know I'm not a big fan of math math I can do math I got decent grades in all my math classes but I just wasn't happy doing it code in C I haven't really done much with C I've seen some things done with C it seems like seems like things that you take for granted in other programming languages you have to do like manually and C and that seems like it would be very tedious so good swears the best tutorial for learning chrome dev tools I don't know if you check out the chrome the google chrome Developers YouTube channel they actually have some big people who have worked on chrome talked about some of the features so I would start there I'm sure there are some other tutorials that are that are good but that's what I usually watch that when a new feature comes out I just check out what the chrome developers say about it I mean they're usually really good at explaining it since they built it so yeah I would definitely check that out jonbi says in response to I ghost about computer science and math and everything is math is hard but very useful to know as for learning see I will say that that will be very very useful when you get into learning systems programming and operating systems cool yep yeah I would say I mean definitely hang in there programming is programming so even if you learn a lot of the basic stuff on a language that you might not be that interested in or you might not you know see the benefit of it all the concepts will transfer well to any language so you know whatever you end up doing later on it won't be a waste to have learned you know whatever language you're learning in your computer science program and I know a lot of computer science programs that I've had experience with will teach things in languages that are kind of really old languages and at first it seems like why would you teach this but as I said I think it's getting the concepts of programming down problem solving things that's what's what's more important it's like I guess is having trouble with the calculus calculus killed me in college that was it was pretty rough XE I ended up just barely getting a B in that class and the teacher was very lenient with me in that but yeah I was a business major and I was in the class with all math majors and so that didn't help either that they were just they just got everything and we're flying through all the lessons and I was like I haven't taken a math class in five years uh so uh it was kind of rough okay all right so there's some more discussion about some details of calculus which I'm gonna skip through a little bit here and it's alright sunshine sure okay I rearranged you had some advice for the era I was getting when I was trying to load when I was trying to run yarn and load all my NPM packages so thank you for that I'm gonna I'll try that after the the streams over let me know beer says did you work I mean job or do you work I mean job so I'm not sure if no beer is asking me or somebody else because I did skip through a bit of all that calculus stuff so I'm not sure so anyway no beer let me know I'm not sure if you were asking that who you were referring to in that question okay Antonia said good evening the text is too small oh sorry about that was it the text I'll have to make this text bigger I'm get I'm assuming that you're talking about the text here although I can first definitely think the text on this page was too small which I wasn't really worried about because the content on the pages doesn't really matter to what we're doing but yeah but let me know if anyone else thinks this the text here is too small and I can make it bigger yeah I'll have to met like as you all know who've watched before I don't use visual studio code often so I don't have my it's not really set up the way and in a way that's comfortable to me yet so I have to get used to it Nova glow says can you do a video working with SharePoint designer I don't know I haven't I haven't done anything the SharePoint before I don't foresee anything in the near future that I would need to do on there but I if there is then I'll try to do video on it okay betterto says I want to clone this project and port to port it to MVC spar spar will says hi everyone noob here hey how's it going thanks for watching okay it looks like so Umberto has been having a lot of trouble with the screen being fuzzy I'm assuming that that's your connection is is anybody else getting low quality because the the stream health has been good the whole time and yes I mean I've been outputting the right number of kilobits per second so it should be okay but let me know okay onk it says so are you a freelancer working for the university or do you have a full time a full day time job yeah I work fulltime for the University so I am employed full time here as a frontend developer I do some freelance work as well on the side though so my camera froze for a while back there and that tone Tony says best freeze face I've seen for a while it's usually it's like mid sneeze or something yeah I did notice it just froze again I did notice that it wasn't a bad freeze I was like smiling and somewhat looking at the camera so could be bad I gotta get this camera thing fixed because I could definitely see it freezing up and me just looking really silly and not realizing it all right Umberto's says the job I'm waiting back on they're going to offer it to me this week is to convert 14 JSP and Java console apps to dotnet I'm so looking forward to that's pretty cool definitely that let me know how it goes like if if you get the job and and how everything goes with that I don't really have experience don't anything like that but it sounds interesting no BIA says you're telling that your connect to FileZilla or some similar software yes so for this particular project I'm not using FileZilla I actually I have all the files from this server for the website or what's the word I can't remember so basically I'll just I'll show you how it works right I it's mounted right so this server is mounted to my file system so I can just go right in there I even have like let me see if I can find it yeah so in this case like I'm in the file structure for this and I can just go right in there right for my machine so that's how I'm kind of in the server right now the downside is I can only work on this site when I'm on campus like they have it routed I don't know maybe just to my IP like I I can only access this from this computer so even if I'm elsewhere on campus on a laptop I can't can't do it so I don't like being limited like that but that's kind of the only I seriously was working here for like a year and a half before I was allowed to even have this much access so I'll take it Harshit says should I pick Redux or mob X I'm confused birdarang xu says mob x is slightly easier than redux but redux is more popular yeah I I would agree with that from what I've from what I've seen from using redux and from tutorials on mob X I think mob X is a little bit easier okay Umberto says he just got to the ass pronunciation it says it still pronounced as it as its acronym as far as I can tell ASP but I would just stick to calling it dotnet alright I'll just I'll try to remember that and just call it dotnet from now on all right it's always hard about pronunciation when you work by I mean I basically work alone most of the time so I only read normally about how to pronounce things unless I can find somebody on YouTube that says it so I just kind of the first time you read it you got to decide in your head well how am I gonna pronounce this thing and that's usually what what sticks a Peter S Mac versus windows I'll say this is my answer for the operating system question I develop on a Mac my servers or Linux and I game on a PC or on a Windows computer so that's that's how I feel about about operating systems okay Harshit says any plans for review I'm getting into it nowadays I don't have any plans to review right now I'm interested in it if you want to learn more about view I would check out there's a series that we just did here free code camp not me I mean but Cody does videos and he just did I think it's like a fivepart series I think there are five parts there might act there might end up being more than that of building something in view from the very beginning all the way through so I would check that out I haven't watched it yet but it seems like it's getting a lot of views and a lot of thumbs up and stuff so it seems like it's it's been well received so far Harshit says do you use zsh in your terminal no I just have the the Bosch just use Bosch for the terminal I mean like my terminal client is I turned 2 but in terms of like my probe profile and everything I think that's what you're asking so let me know if it's not haha John B says oh the great pronunciation words I'm still a fan of the ever looming war of SQL vs sequel I prefer sequel when it comes to that unless or why I prefer sequel but I usually do say sequel but I hear SQL a lot yeah I don't know why we worry so much about pronouncing these acronyms like does it really matter and as long as you know what the other person is talking about I don't I don't know that it matters all right well I've gotten to the bottom of the live chat if I happen to miss your question I apologize you can send me a message on Twitter or comment on the video or something and I'll try to get to your question I should be back tomorrow like I said there's a chance that I may not stream tomorrow and I may be working on my my Redux project so yeah oh I may be working on it it's given me a lot of trouble so far so hopefully hopefully a tomorrow I can stream and say hey I finished my project and I turned it in so the chances of that right now don't seem really good but I can hope right so I'll be back probably tomorrow I'll let you know I'll send out a tweet tomorrow and I'll schedule the stream as early as I can so you get two notifications on YouTube if you're subscribed but until then have a great day and thanks for so much thank you so much for watching and contributing in the live chat and I really appreciate it
