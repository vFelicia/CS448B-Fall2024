00:00 - in this video I'll be defining four
00:02 - binary operators for sets I've defined
00:06 - uh two sets A and B to help give some
00:09 - examples so the first is a union B which
00:14 - equals a set containing elements P such
00:16 - that P is an element of a or p is an
00:19 - element of B the next is the
00:22 - intersection a intersection b equals the
00:26 - set containing elements P such that P is
00:29 - an element of A and P is an element of
00:33 - B the next is the set difference of a
00:36 - and b which equals the set containing P
00:39 - or elements P such that P is an element
00:41 - of A and P is not an element of B and
00:46 - finally we have the symmetric difference
00:48 - which is uh going to be very helpful
00:51 - when you actually complete the symmetric
00:54 - difference algorithm challenge so the
00:57 - symmetric difference of a and b equals
01:00 - the set difference of a and b unioned
01:02 - with the set difference of b and
01:05 - a and finally I will uh fi Define the
01:09 - irrational numbers which I hinted to at
01:11 - the end of last video so the irrational
01:14 - numbers are simply the real number real
01:18 - numbers uh minus the rational numbers
01:22 - and that equals the irrational numbers
