00:01 - hey hey hey free code camp people chris
00:04 - coyer here i'm one of the founders of
00:05 - codepen i know that free code camp as
00:08 - you work your way through it there's you
00:09 - know an exercise or two where they uh uh
00:12 - optionally you can pop over to codepen
00:14 - to do the work to complete the thing
00:15 - which is just so cool but anyway i'm
00:17 - just going to talk about codepen and how
00:20 - it works and introduce you to it in case
00:22 - you just have no idea or are interested
00:24 - in it and how it might be able to help
00:26 - you on your learning to code journey
00:28 - because it certainly can do that so i'm
00:30 - just here logged out on codepen codepen
00:32 - is a site that just like free codecab
00:34 - you can have an account on
00:36 - and it's free to sign up so if you're
00:38 - interested in signing up just hit sign
00:39 - up and it'll take you right to the free
00:41 - sign up and you can sign up through your
00:43 - github account or just with your email
00:44 - address or whatever when you land here
00:46 - on codepen you know it kind of tells you
00:48 - what codepen is but there's all these
00:50 - all these things here all these cards
00:51 - down here and these will always be
00:53 - different every time you come to codepen
00:55 - because they're
00:56 - uh
00:57 - we picked them out the staff of codepen
00:59 - picks out cool things that people are
01:01 - doing could be you you know if you sign
01:03 - up for codepen and do something cool on
01:05 - here we'll pick it and just just to show
01:07 - off interesting things and there's just
01:09 - dozens and dozens of these get picked
01:10 - every day you know so come around and
01:12 - check out what people are doing and
01:14 - codepen is like so what are these things
01:16 - and what
01:17 - what are they exactly that these people
01:19 - have made we call them pens on codepen
01:22 - it's one of the things that you can
01:23 - create on codepen probably the most
01:25 - popular thing and i'm gonna go ahead and
01:27 - do one actually you know what let me uh
01:28 - let me log into my own account here i'll
01:31 - log in
01:32 - through github and i'll pop into my own
01:34 - account which is just it's gonna show me
01:36 - the same stuff here but i'm gonna go to
01:38 - this create menu and i'm gonna say
01:40 - create new pen and this is kind of the
01:42 - heart and soul of codepen is the editor
01:45 - so you're learning to code on free code
01:47 - camp
01:48 - you can
01:49 - do some of that coding right here on
01:51 - codemen you just type html type css type
01:54 - javascript and the results of what
01:56 - you're doing show up here in this kind
01:58 - of big white area the preview area over
02:00 - here so if i were to type
02:01 - hello campers
02:05 - as i type you can see that being output
02:08 - over here or i could
02:09 - for example
02:11 - make an h1 tag you know a big header tag
02:13 - and say hello
02:15 - and that's going to render over here as
02:17 - well i can write css as well let me
02:19 - target that h1 tag and write color
02:22 - equals red this is valid css and it's
02:25 - you know my hello has become red over
02:27 - here how cool is that javascript works
02:30 - in the same way i could say you know var
02:33 - you know a equals
02:35 - one or work on my javascript skills and
02:38 - i could say console.log a and it's going
02:41 - to output
02:42 - one of course i can even open a console
02:44 - here and i'll show me those results we
02:45 - have a console writing code pen so wow
02:48 - i've made my first pen congratulations
02:50 - myself i've done good work here
02:54 - so what else can you do here let's like
02:56 - do something a little bit more robust
02:58 - let's make like a card component so you
03:01 - see i've just typed card and then press
03:03 - tab right there that's emmet which you
03:05 - might be familiar with that works in
03:06 - lots of different editors helps me write
03:08 - html a little quicker and it has some
03:10 - css stuff as well let's have an h2 and
03:13 - i'll say my card
03:15 - let's say it'll have some
03:17 - a p tag in there i'm going to type lorem
03:19 - and hit tab and you get a bunch of
03:21 - gibberish text that lorem ipsum text
03:23 - it's called just filler text you know
03:26 - let's say body
03:28 - and html are have a height of a hundred
03:32 - viewport height units and then it's
03:35 - display
03:36 - see it's helping me out with code
03:38 - completion here that's kind of nice
03:40 - let's say it's display grid that modern
03:42 - fancy thing and that we're going to
03:45 - place items which is how
03:48 - grid works
03:50 - in the center and that's going to put my
03:52 - card in the middle and if i say my card
03:54 - say has a max width maybe of 4 500
03:58 - pixels let's say it'll go in the middle
04:00 - maybe even narrow you'll see that it's
04:02 - kind of centering in the middle that's
04:04 - nice that's nice i don't need my
04:06 - javascript i could say
04:07 - whisk that away i can kind of
04:10 - control the look of of how things are
04:12 - going here on codepen i can move my
04:14 - editors over here if it's more
04:15 - convenient or put them at the top
04:17 - i can do all kinds of stuff so again i'm
04:19 - just saving my pen as i go i can title
04:21 - it and say playing with cards for
04:24 - example and i'll be able to find this
04:26 - again pretty easily at any time i can
04:28 - jump back to my dashboard that's
04:30 - available in my user menu here or any
04:32 - header that looks like this it'll say
04:34 - your dashboard i can find that again
04:37 - that's it's forever it's never going
04:39 - away i go under pens and i could say
04:42 - show me you know my recent
04:44 - remated cards here's my playing with
04:45 - card ones it's right here so i could pop
04:47 - that open again or if i you know have
04:49 - lost track of it i could search for
04:52 - card or something or what did i call it
04:55 - playing with cards i can get it to show
04:57 - up but it's listing them by popularity
04:59 - here so i could say show me my newest
05:01 - ones first that's going to find me my
05:03 - card anyway the point is your work is
05:05 - saved here so it's kind of a it's kind
05:08 - of nice you don't have to worry about
05:09 - losing the files or anything like that
05:11 - so
05:12 - let's see you might notice that the the
05:14 - css up here says scss after that that's
05:17 - a css preprocessor something that's
05:20 - really easy to use on codepen so
05:22 - if i click that little cog next to it
05:24 - there or open my settings and go to the
05:26 - css tab well for one thing it's going to
05:28 - show me the title and i might have a
05:30 - description here that says like oh just
05:33 - showing
05:35 - free code camp people some things just
05:40 - adjusting just
05:42 - you know whatever i have a description
05:44 - there i can use mark down there and tag
05:45 - things but we were talking about
05:46 - preprocessors instead of saying none
05:49 - just regular css i had particularly
05:51 - picked out scss which is you know a sas
05:54 - preprocessor meaning i could do
05:56 - something like i don't know dollar sign
05:58 - bg
06:00 - color equals
06:01 - um what's like a cool color fog dog
06:04 - that's one of my favorites fo6 do6
06:08 - yeah
06:09 - and that's not valid css that doesn't
06:11 - mean anything in the language css but it
06:13 - does you know if i say html background
06:16 - now i can use that variable that i just
06:18 - created
06:19 - background color and it's gonna make
06:21 - that oh but now my card is weird i'm
06:23 - gonna have to say background
06:25 - white and padding maybe of two ram or
06:29 - something that's a nice looking card
06:32 - component isn't it cool so i'm using a
06:35 - css preprocessor there and there's lots
06:36 - of different versions of html
06:38 - preprocessors css preprocessors
06:40 - javascript preprocessors all that stuff
06:42 - is available
06:44 - now let's see what if what if we're
06:46 - learning bootstrap or we wanted some
06:48 - kind of freebies out of our our css a
06:51 - bit i could open up settings again and
06:52 - notice there's more things going on here
06:54 - for one i could click something like
06:56 - normalize you'll see the fonts change a
06:57 - little bit when i turn that on that's
06:59 - kind of a css reset library and it's
07:02 - just applying those styles to the pen we
07:04 - do want to make things like that really
07:05 - quick for you
07:07 - vendor prefixing it can do for you but
07:09 - let's say i want to use a library like
07:10 - foundation or something i can just click
07:12 - that or i could have searched for
07:14 - foundation or used our
07:18 - quick add
07:19 - to find stuff like that now some of this
07:21 - stuff changes over time so just they'll
07:23 - always be searched so that's probably
07:25 - your your best bet for looking for
07:27 - things but anyway now that we've had
07:28 - added foundation we should see some
07:30 - changes to our card as well wow that's
07:32 - kind of cool
07:34 - foundation being applied to the card as
07:36 - well so lots of stuff to play around
07:38 - with write your own code or bring in
07:40 - libraries from elsewhere you can play
07:42 - with bootstrap or bulma or whatever
07:44 - these
07:45 - materialize fancy frameworks are those
07:47 - are easy and quick to play with on
07:49 - codepen so let's say i want to make a
07:51 - variation of this or i found this and it
07:53 - wasn't mine it was somebody else's i'd
07:56 - be looking at their pen and i could hit
07:57 - this fork button which would fork it
07:59 - from their account to my account it'll
08:01 - just give me a copy of it that i can
08:03 - begin playing with immediately so i'll
08:05 - do that notice the url changes so that
08:07 - other one will just stay exactly how it
08:09 - is forever but this new copy of it will
08:12 - be totally changed you know let's say i
08:14 - make the background purple
08:16 - and i change it on this copy this copy
08:18 - is totally unique
08:21 - and the other one won't be affected in
08:23 - any way so that's a way you can make
08:24 - kind of a variation of a thing that's
08:26 - kind of neat
08:28 - so let's say there's some things that i
08:30 - know that i personally really like
08:31 - myself to work with like i really like
08:34 - sas so i don't want to turn on sass
08:36 - every time you might even notice when i
08:37 - turned on this pen sass was already
08:39 - turned on for me that's a setting so
08:41 - i'll go under my user menu here and i
08:43 - can pop open settings and it's going to
08:45 - take me right to my editor settings and
08:47 - there's a lot of stuff here so you know
08:49 - forgive it being a little overwhelming
08:51 - but i can say you know when i start a
08:52 - new pen my defaults make my default sass
08:56 - and turn these settings on and i like
08:58 - tabs instead of spaces and maybe i like
09:01 - you know gentronic as a font or or fire
09:04 - code or fira code rather than
09:07 - operator mana or whatever you know you
09:09 - can kind of pick out your settings maybe
09:11 - i'll change to a different theme and if
09:13 - i come back here and reload things will
09:15 - just look a little different i have a
09:17 - little bit of different settings there
09:18 - you can just make sure codepen is
09:20 - comfortable for you i think that's
09:22 - pretty fun
09:24 - uh okay so let's see let's see let's see
09:27 - there's a couple of other interesting
09:29 - things we could do here so let's say we
09:30 - really like
09:32 - this css for centering things that was
09:34 - really useful for us but we want to make
09:37 - a different pen
09:38 - that just leverages the css written here
09:41 - but otherwise start fresh that's kind of
09:42 - an interesting thing you can do so i can
09:44 - take this url of this pen
09:47 - and i can start this new pen has is
09:50 - nothing it's totally blank new thing
09:52 - under my settings under css i can put a
09:54 - link to that pen
09:56 - and close it and i think you'll see the
09:58 - background go purple because it's going
10:00 - to load in the css from this pan into
10:03 - this pen
10:04 - so cool like there's no code here but
10:06 - the background's already purple because
10:08 - there really is some code it's the css
10:10 - from that other pen and this one so if
10:12 - we wrote card again and wrote hello
10:15 - we're going to have a card in the middle
10:16 - here but we didn't have to style it this
10:18 - time the css was coming from elsewhere
10:20 - just like it would have been if we
10:21 - loaded up bootstrap or something like
10:23 - that so that's kind of neat uh the other
10:26 - way around is let's say i wanted to use
10:28 - this pen
10:29 - the html and not the css so i wanted to
10:32 - like oh let me close out that
10:36 - but i want this html certainly i could
10:38 - just copy and paste it over there or
10:40 - make a fork or whatever but i can also
10:43 - this is just kind of interesting thing
10:44 - you should know is grab this url
10:50 - and put it in triple brackets over here
10:52 - paste get rid of that and it's going to
10:55 - pull in the html from that pen into this
10:57 - pen so if i make changes to this html
10:59 - boom i'll see it over here as well so
11:01 - just kind of a little interesting trick
11:03 - that you may not have
11:05 - known about in the past
11:07 - so let's do something kind of
11:09 - javascripty for one we might as well
11:10 - keep this here
11:12 - actually let's just play with our
11:14 - original whatever we're just playing
11:15 - around right we already had a little
11:16 - javascript over there i think we like
11:18 - console.logged
11:20 - something we could do something a little
11:23 - javascripty if we if we feel like it so
11:26 - for example we could say like let's say
11:28 - when you uh let's put a button in here
11:30 - so it feels like a real action you know
11:32 - button
11:33 - is go away
11:35 - uh so that will be there and it doesn't
11:37 - do anything because buttons don't do
11:39 - anything when they're not in a form just
11:40 - sitting there like that but we could say
11:42 - uh ma i'm going to let because we can
11:45 - write in modern javascript why not right
11:47 - let button equal
11:49 - query selector
11:52 - button
11:55 - now i have a reference to that button
11:57 - and i can use the regular browser
11:59 - console if i want also i could say
12:01 - um well if i type button here it's not
12:03 - going to be quite right because the
12:05 - context is wrong right i have to i would
12:07 - have to make sure to
12:09 - to select the correct context which is
12:12 - one of these things or you know what if
12:14 - you just
12:15 - inspect something it changes the context
12:18 - for you so if now if i type button
12:20 - um
12:22 - that button button is not defined
12:24 - queries oh document
12:27 - document.queryselector where you free
12:29 - codecamp people aren't you gotta watch
12:31 - me
12:33 - um so now i'm in the right context and
12:35 - now if i type button it's gonna show me
12:39 - come on in my console does is button the
12:42 - right thing
12:46 - one
12:47 - let button query selector for the button
12:50 - element
12:51 - i still think it should be it's oh it's
12:53 - i see that's the one is just coming from
12:55 - this or whatever but we can say uh
12:59 - button dot add event
13:02 - listener
13:04 - click so if you click that button it's
13:06 - going to run some code and we can can we
13:08 - stay
13:08 - can we stay fancy yes 60 oh look era
13:12 - code has this nice ligature button kind
13:14 - of thingy here isn't it
13:16 - click
13:18 - oh it's it's click but it's we need a
13:20 - click
13:22 - uh we need the event i guess or you
13:24 - could just have empty if you're not
13:25 - going to use the event which we're not
13:27 - going to we'll say console.log
13:30 - clicked so i am going to open my my
13:34 - console here and
13:35 - okay it is logging the right button at
13:37 - the top of this i can always write
13:39 - console.clear which every time the pen
13:42 - runs then it will clear the console
13:44 - instead of it just persisting you might
13:45 - want it either way but whatever so okay
13:47 - i click this button over and over click
13:49 - click click click that should work
13:52 - let button
13:55 - is it not liking lead for something
13:59 - query selector
14:00 - for a button
14:02 - there really is a button it's right here
14:05 - i'm clicking the button
14:10 - add event listen er i think i spelled it
14:13 - wrong
14:15 - i spelled it wrong there it is i'm so
14:18 - glad okay so click click click click
14:20 - click we've just done a little
14:21 - javascript or whatever that all works
14:23 - perfectly well uh in codepen as well
14:26 - should we have it actually do something
14:27 - maybe we should select the card as well
14:30 - it definitely wasn't that um let's say
14:32 - the card is the
14:34 - the card i know a lot of times use query
14:36 - selector all but there's only one card
14:37 - here we know there's only one card so
14:39 - we'll just say
14:41 - card has you know when you click it
14:43 - we're going to say
14:45 - card.class
14:46 - list dot
14:48 - add
14:49 - away because we've told it to go away
14:51 - right so we're using scss so we can nest
14:54 - in our css a little bit that's always
14:56 - fun we'll say dot
14:58 - or and dot away so card dot away when
15:02 - the card has also has the class away
15:04 - we'll say
15:05 - translate
15:07 - oh transform
15:09 - translate y the vertical direction like
15:13 - i don't know 2 000 pixels or something
15:15 - and if there's a transition on the card
15:19 - transition trans
15:21 - i should use auto complete more with my
15:24 - typing skills let's let it make it take
15:27 - a long time like one second so when you
15:29 - click this whoop it goes away but now
15:32 - it's gone away how do i start over here
15:34 - all that to say you can press command
15:36 - shift 5 and that will rerun
15:38 - so it'll refresh
15:40 - uh that's kind of a thing even if you
15:42 - change this to like red or something
15:45 - it's you know it's a lot of times you
15:46 - change javascript you change html we
15:49 - refresh the demo for you so that
15:51 - sometimes works but not when you write
15:53 - oops
15:55 - um css css we try to inject it for you
15:59 - which is kind of cool because you see it
16:01 - even transition from red to white there
16:03 - because if you're in a particular state
16:05 - like you're trying to style a drop down
16:06 - menu or something just changing the css
16:08 - it's kind of nice to
16:10 - have it not refresh the page every time
16:12 - if you really want explicit refreshing i
16:14 - said as command shift 5 but you can
16:17 - always go under your javascript settings
16:19 - and we i know we haven't looked at this
16:20 - but surprise surprise you can add
16:22 - external javascript libraries like
16:25 - jquery or react or vue or all that type
16:28 - of stuff
16:29 - and pre-process with things like babel
16:31 - or coffeescript and all that but what i
16:33 - was going to show you is under the
16:34 - behavior tab you can say auto updating
16:36 - preview nope don't want that so you'll
16:39 - get a run button so you got to remember
16:41 - you did this because you might make a
16:43 - change like my car with exclamation
16:45 - points and normally codepen would just
16:47 - refresh this browser window we're down
16:49 - here but it's not you have to press run
16:51 - and then it'll refresh and you'll see
16:53 - the exclamation points down there so
16:56 - um
16:57 - that's that that's writing some
16:58 - javascript and stuff we looked at the
17:00 - console we looked at that kind of thing
17:03 - um i have some links we could look at
17:05 - here you know think if you're learning
17:06 - something more advanced like react for
17:09 - example or ajax and all all that kind of
17:11 - stuff works just fine on codepen so
17:14 - here's an example where we loaded up the
17:16 - react library and we made a uh
17:20 - ajax call for some for some data and
17:23 - pulled it in and used state and looped
17:25 - over all that state and that kind of
17:27 - stuff
17:28 - we use jsx in here too if you if you are
17:31 - going to use jsx you will have to flip
17:32 - on the babel preprocessor in javascript
17:36 - there but that's kind of cool so there's
17:38 - something else that you should know on
17:39 - codepen of course
17:41 - right at the beginning of this video we
17:42 - looked at you know here's all this new
17:44 - stuff and in fact look there's even been
17:46 - some new things that have been added to
17:48 - the home page even since we this video
17:50 - has even been started let's look at this
17:52 - pen just for fun
17:54 - um
17:55 - i have something in mind that i was
17:57 - going to show you but
17:58 - no javascript this is a checkbox that oh
18:01 - look how clever that is the corner of
18:03 - the box becomes the check
18:05 - that's the coolest thing i ever saw if
18:06 - you wanted to explore how that was done
18:08 - of course all the code is here for you
18:10 - too and it's open source code i could
18:13 - fork a copy of my own and make changes
18:15 - or use this even in a project of my own
18:18 - so darn cool love that anyway i'm gonna
18:21 - heart it because to show some love for
18:23 - this pen you know even that harding this
18:25 - is what i was originally gonna show you
18:28 - works into some algorithms on codepen to
18:31 - increase its popularity and
18:34 - and for one of those things we use
18:35 - popularity for is search so if i look up
18:38 - check boxes
18:40 - in search we haven't this is what i
18:41 - wanted to show you a search on codepen
18:43 - and just enter that search we're going
18:45 - to show you all kinds of stuff here i
18:48 - would i guess it's not showing you how
18:49 - many results there are but i'll tell you
18:51 - for check boxes there's probably
18:53 - tens of thousands or more of results
18:55 - here and we're kind of ordering them by
18:58 - relevance and uh hearts and views and
19:02 - comments and all kinds of fancy stuff
19:04 - here to make sure that when you search
19:05 - for stuff you're getting really
19:07 - interesting results and showing you kind
19:09 - of a lot of the best stuff on codepen
19:10 - around that search and even the pens we
19:13 - made today like the card and stuff
19:15 - that's all
19:16 - findable from other people from search
19:18 - so if i've named it well and added a
19:20 - good description and
19:21 - it has a few hearts and stuff that type
19:23 - of stuff ends up in search and becomes
19:25 - part of the kind of the codepen
19:27 - ecosystem
19:29 - which is nice so let's see do we have a
19:31 - pen open left i just want to show you a
19:33 - few more things and then we'll kind of
19:34 - be done so if it turns out that you
19:37 - really like working in codepen or
19:39 - you know a lot of people end up using it
19:41 - for you know working in teams because we
19:43 - have teams accounts or they they use it
19:45 - in a teaching environment or they use it
19:47 - even in their agency for showing clients
19:50 - work that they're working on let's say
19:52 - it's that one i might want to make this
19:54 - private because i want to show this to
19:56 - my i don't want the world to see this
19:57 - yet i don't want it in search i don't
19:59 - want people finding it on my profile
20:01 - everybody has a profile on codepen as
20:03 - well i want this to be hidden from the
20:05 - world well all i have to do is open up
20:07 - settings and kick it onto private which
20:09 - is a pro feature of codepen so there's
20:11 - there's a few things that kind of have
20:12 - to be paid for on codepen and now look
20:14 - at how weird this url is nobody could
20:16 - ever find that it's not in search it's
20:18 - not it's totally gone from codepen only
20:20 - you can see it and somebody that you'd
20:22 - share that url with so you could share
20:24 - that url with your client they could see
20:25 - this and nobody else could so just an
20:28 - example of a pro feature another pro
20:30 - feature is like let's say you're using
20:31 - it for
20:32 - teaching purposes i could open the same
20:34 - pad in collab mode and it looks a little
20:36 - different you can see the yellow bar
20:38 - there so you're kind of sure that you're
20:39 - in collab mode notice that you have chat
20:41 - as well here
20:43 - i could open this
20:45 - in another browser
20:47 - or share this with a friend and then we
20:49 - could be typing at the same time and you
20:51 - could see their cursor jumping around
20:53 - and adding code to you can work together
20:55 - there's real time features of codepen
20:57 - that's another example of kind of a pro
20:59 - feature on codepen so so that's kind of
21:02 - that that's kind of the you know and
21:04 - there's so much more to codepen i
21:06 - haven't shown you projects i haven't
21:07 - shown you professor mode i haven't shown
21:09 - you asset hosting even that's a big one
21:11 - maybe we'll end with that one i can
21:13 - click assets down here and it's going to
21:15 - open up a your files section which i can
21:17 - drag and drop stuff like images and
21:20 - javascript and
21:21 - css or any file that i want to here and
21:24 - give me quick access to urls to use
21:26 - those on codepen and then there's some
21:28 - things that we give to you so let's say
21:30 - i wanted to have a picture of let's see
21:34 - playing cards i could do a search here
21:36 - and it's going to give me a bunch of
21:38 - design assets for playing cards
21:40 - hopefully
21:42 - and i can let's see i'm going to grab
21:44 - the full background image there i'm
21:47 - going to hit escape to close it
21:49 - and rather than a purple background here
21:52 - i'm going to use my
21:53 - new
21:54 - playing cards image back there and
21:56 - hopefully that will pop right in there
21:58 - background image url
22:02 - oh i have to hit run
22:04 - you could have told me that
22:07 - uh and it's so big that it's you can
22:10 - barely even see it but it did show up
22:11 - there i'll say background size contain
22:15 - and that's going to kind of squish it
22:17 - down covers almost the better one isn't
22:20 - it background
22:21 - size cover
22:24 - run and then i'll shrink it up a little
22:27 - bit so we can see the playing cards but
22:29 - we make those kind of things available
22:31 - to you
22:32 - and there's so much more but i'm gonna
22:34 - stop now i hope you made it this far
22:36 - thanks so much for listening code camp
22:38 - pre-code camp people uh it's so awesome
22:41 - to see some of you pop over to codepen
22:43 - and use it for stuff like learning and
22:45 - playing goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hey hey hey free code camp people chris coyer here i'm one of the founders of codepen i know that free code camp as you work your way through it there's you know an exercise or two where they uh uh optionally you can pop over to codepen to do the work to complete the thing which is just so cool but anyway i'm just going to talk about codepen and how it works and introduce you to it in case you just have no idea or are interested in it and how it might be able to help you on your learning to code journey because it certainly can do that so i'm just here logged out on codepen codepen is a site that just like free codecab you can have an account on and it's free to sign up so if you're interested in signing up just hit sign up and it'll take you right to the free sign up and you can sign up through your github account or just with your email address or whatever when you land here on codepen you know it kind of tells you what codepen is but there's all these all these things here all these cards down here and these will always be different every time you come to codepen because they're uh we picked them out the staff of codepen picks out cool things that people are doing could be you you know if you sign up for codepen and do something cool on here we'll pick it and just just to show off interesting things and there's just dozens and dozens of these get picked every day you know so come around and check out what people are doing and codepen is like so what are these things and what what are they exactly that these people have made we call them pens on codepen it's one of the things that you can create on codepen probably the most popular thing and i'm gonna go ahead and do one actually you know what let me uh let me log into my own account here i'll log in through github and i'll pop into my own account which is just it's gonna show me the same stuff here but i'm gonna go to this create menu and i'm gonna say create new pen and this is kind of the heart and soul of codepen is the editor so you're learning to code on free code camp you can do some of that coding right here on codemen you just type html type css type javascript and the results of what you're doing show up here in this kind of big white area the preview area over here so if i were to type hello campers as i type you can see that being output over here or i could for example make an h1 tag you know a big header tag and say hello and that's going to render over here as well i can write css as well let me target that h1 tag and write color equals red this is valid css and it's you know my hello has become red over here how cool is that javascript works in the same way i could say you know var you know a equals one or work on my javascript skills and i could say console.log a and it's going to output one of course i can even open a console here and i'll show me those results we have a console writing code pen so wow i've made my first pen congratulations myself i've done good work here so what else can you do here let's like do something a little bit more robust let's make like a card component so you see i've just typed card and then press tab right there that's emmet which you might be familiar with that works in lots of different editors helps me write html a little quicker and it has some css stuff as well let's have an h2 and i'll say my card let's say it'll have some a p tag in there i'm going to type lorem and hit tab and you get a bunch of gibberish text that lorem ipsum text it's called just filler text you know let's say body and html are have a height of a hundred viewport height units and then it's display see it's helping me out with code completion here that's kind of nice let's say it's display grid that modern fancy thing and that we're going to place items which is how grid works in the center and that's going to put my card in the middle and if i say my card say has a max width maybe of 4 500 pixels let's say it'll go in the middle maybe even narrow you'll see that it's kind of centering in the middle that's nice that's nice i don't need my javascript i could say whisk that away i can kind of control the look of of how things are going here on codepen i can move my editors over here if it's more convenient or put them at the top i can do all kinds of stuff so again i'm just saving my pen as i go i can title it and say playing with cards for example and i'll be able to find this again pretty easily at any time i can jump back to my dashboard that's available in my user menu here or any header that looks like this it'll say your dashboard i can find that again that's it's forever it's never going away i go under pens and i could say show me you know my recent remated cards here's my playing with card ones it's right here so i could pop that open again or if i you know have lost track of it i could search for card or something or what did i call it playing with cards i can get it to show up but it's listing them by popularity here so i could say show me my newest ones first that's going to find me my card anyway the point is your work is saved here so it's kind of a it's kind of nice you don't have to worry about losing the files or anything like that so let's see you might notice that the the css up here says scss after that that's a css preprocessor something that's really easy to use on codepen so if i click that little cog next to it there or open my settings and go to the css tab well for one thing it's going to show me the title and i might have a description here that says like oh just showing free code camp people some things just adjusting just you know whatever i have a description there i can use mark down there and tag things but we were talking about preprocessors instead of saying none just regular css i had particularly picked out scss which is you know a sas preprocessor meaning i could do something like i don't know dollar sign bg color equals um what's like a cool color fog dog that's one of my favorites fo6 do6 yeah and that's not valid css that doesn't mean anything in the language css but it does you know if i say html background now i can use that variable that i just created background color and it's gonna make that oh but now my card is weird i'm gonna have to say background white and padding maybe of two ram or something that's a nice looking card component isn't it cool so i'm using a css preprocessor there and there's lots of different versions of html preprocessors css preprocessors javascript preprocessors all that stuff is available now let's see what if what if we're learning bootstrap or we wanted some kind of freebies out of our our css a bit i could open up settings again and notice there's more things going on here for one i could click something like normalize you'll see the fonts change a little bit when i turn that on that's kind of a css reset library and it's just applying those styles to the pen we do want to make things like that really quick for you vendor prefixing it can do for you but let's say i want to use a library like foundation or something i can just click that or i could have searched for foundation or used our quick add to find stuff like that now some of this stuff changes over time so just they'll always be searched so that's probably your your best bet for looking for things but anyway now that we've had added foundation we should see some changes to our card as well wow that's kind of cool foundation being applied to the card as well so lots of stuff to play around with write your own code or bring in libraries from elsewhere you can play with bootstrap or bulma or whatever these materialize fancy frameworks are those are easy and quick to play with on codepen so let's say i want to make a variation of this or i found this and it wasn't mine it was somebody else's i'd be looking at their pen and i could hit this fork button which would fork it from their account to my account it'll just give me a copy of it that i can begin playing with immediately so i'll do that notice the url changes so that other one will just stay exactly how it is forever but this new copy of it will be totally changed you know let's say i make the background purple and i change it on this copy this copy is totally unique and the other one won't be affected in any way so that's a way you can make kind of a variation of a thing that's kind of neat so let's say there's some things that i know that i personally really like myself to work with like i really like sas so i don't want to turn on sass every time you might even notice when i turned on this pen sass was already turned on for me that's a setting so i'll go under my user menu here and i can pop open settings and it's going to take me right to my editor settings and there's a lot of stuff here so you know forgive it being a little overwhelming but i can say you know when i start a new pen my defaults make my default sass and turn these settings on and i like tabs instead of spaces and maybe i like you know gentronic as a font or or fire code or fira code rather than operator mana or whatever you know you can kind of pick out your settings maybe i'll change to a different theme and if i come back here and reload things will just look a little different i have a little bit of different settings there you can just make sure codepen is comfortable for you i think that's pretty fun uh okay so let's see let's see let's see there's a couple of other interesting things we could do here so let's say we really like this css for centering things that was really useful for us but we want to make a different pen that just leverages the css written here but otherwise start fresh that's kind of an interesting thing you can do so i can take this url of this pen and i can start this new pen has is nothing it's totally blank new thing under my settings under css i can put a link to that pen and close it and i think you'll see the background go purple because it's going to load in the css from this pan into this pen so cool like there's no code here but the background's already purple because there really is some code it's the css from that other pen and this one so if we wrote card again and wrote hello we're going to have a card in the middle here but we didn't have to style it this time the css was coming from elsewhere just like it would have been if we loaded up bootstrap or something like that so that's kind of neat uh the other way around is let's say i wanted to use this pen the html and not the css so i wanted to like oh let me close out that but i want this html certainly i could just copy and paste it over there or make a fork or whatever but i can also this is just kind of interesting thing you should know is grab this url and put it in triple brackets over here paste get rid of that and it's going to pull in the html from that pen into this pen so if i make changes to this html boom i'll see it over here as well so just kind of a little interesting trick that you may not have known about in the past so let's do something kind of javascripty for one we might as well keep this here actually let's just play with our original whatever we're just playing around right we already had a little javascript over there i think we like console.logged something we could do something a little javascripty if we if we feel like it so for example we could say like let's say when you uh let's put a button in here so it feels like a real action you know button is go away uh so that will be there and it doesn't do anything because buttons don't do anything when they're not in a form just sitting there like that but we could say uh ma i'm going to let because we can write in modern javascript why not right let button equal query selector button now i have a reference to that button and i can use the regular browser console if i want also i could say um well if i type button here it's not going to be quite right because the context is wrong right i have to i would have to make sure to to select the correct context which is one of these things or you know what if you just inspect something it changes the context for you so if now if i type button um that button button is not defined queries oh document document.queryselector where you free codecamp people aren't you gotta watch me um so now i'm in the right context and now if i type button it's gonna show me come on in my console does is button the right thing one let button query selector for the button element i still think it should be it's oh it's i see that's the one is just coming from this or whatever but we can say uh button dot add event listener click so if you click that button it's going to run some code and we can can we stay can we stay fancy yes 60 oh look era code has this nice ligature button kind of thingy here isn't it click oh it's it's click but it's we need a click uh we need the event i guess or you could just have empty if you're not going to use the event which we're not going to we'll say console.log clicked so i am going to open my my console here and okay it is logging the right button at the top of this i can always write console.clear which every time the pen runs then it will clear the console instead of it just persisting you might want it either way but whatever so okay i click this button over and over click click click click that should work let button is it not liking lead for something query selector for a button there really is a button it's right here i'm clicking the button add event listen er i think i spelled it wrong i spelled it wrong there it is i'm so glad okay so click click click click click we've just done a little javascript or whatever that all works perfectly well uh in codepen as well should we have it actually do something maybe we should select the card as well it definitely wasn't that um let's say the card is the the card i know a lot of times use query selector all but there's only one card here we know there's only one card so we'll just say card has you know when you click it we're going to say card.class list dot add away because we've told it to go away right so we're using scss so we can nest in our css a little bit that's always fun we'll say dot or and dot away so card dot away when the card has also has the class away we'll say translate oh transform translate y the vertical direction like i don't know 2 000 pixels or something and if there's a transition on the card transition trans i should use auto complete more with my typing skills let's let it make it take a long time like one second so when you click this whoop it goes away but now it's gone away how do i start over here all that to say you can press command shift 5 and that will rerun so it'll refresh uh that's kind of a thing even if you change this to like red or something it's you know it's a lot of times you change javascript you change html we refresh the demo for you so that sometimes works but not when you write oops um css css we try to inject it for you which is kind of cool because you see it even transition from red to white there because if you're in a particular state like you're trying to style a drop down menu or something just changing the css it's kind of nice to have it not refresh the page every time if you really want explicit refreshing i said as command shift 5 but you can always go under your javascript settings and we i know we haven't looked at this but surprise surprise you can add external javascript libraries like jquery or react or vue or all that type of stuff and preprocess with things like babel or coffeescript and all that but what i was going to show you is under the behavior tab you can say auto updating preview nope don't want that so you'll get a run button so you got to remember you did this because you might make a change like my car with exclamation points and normally codepen would just refresh this browser window we're down here but it's not you have to press run and then it'll refresh and you'll see the exclamation points down there so um that's that that's writing some javascript and stuff we looked at the console we looked at that kind of thing um i have some links we could look at here you know think if you're learning something more advanced like react for example or ajax and all all that kind of stuff works just fine on codepen so here's an example where we loaded up the react library and we made a uh ajax call for some for some data and pulled it in and used state and looped over all that state and that kind of stuff we use jsx in here too if you if you are going to use jsx you will have to flip on the babel preprocessor in javascript there but that's kind of cool so there's something else that you should know on codepen of course right at the beginning of this video we looked at you know here's all this new stuff and in fact look there's even been some new things that have been added to the home page even since we this video has even been started let's look at this pen just for fun um i have something in mind that i was going to show you but no javascript this is a checkbox that oh look how clever that is the corner of the box becomes the check that's the coolest thing i ever saw if you wanted to explore how that was done of course all the code is here for you too and it's open source code i could fork a copy of my own and make changes or use this even in a project of my own so darn cool love that anyway i'm gonna heart it because to show some love for this pen you know even that harding this is what i was originally gonna show you works into some algorithms on codepen to increase its popularity and and for one of those things we use popularity for is search so if i look up check boxes in search we haven't this is what i wanted to show you a search on codepen and just enter that search we're going to show you all kinds of stuff here i would i guess it's not showing you how many results there are but i'll tell you for check boxes there's probably tens of thousands or more of results here and we're kind of ordering them by relevance and uh hearts and views and comments and all kinds of fancy stuff here to make sure that when you search for stuff you're getting really interesting results and showing you kind of a lot of the best stuff on codepen around that search and even the pens we made today like the card and stuff that's all findable from other people

another pro feature is like let's say you're using it for teaching purposes i could open the same pad in collab mode and it looks a little different you can see the yellow bar there so you're kind of

their cursor jumping around and adding code to you can work together there's real time features of codepen that's another example of kind of a pro feature on codepen so so that's kind of that that's kind of the you know and there's so much more to codepen i haven't shown you projects i haven't shown you professor mode i haven't shown you asset hosting even that's a big one maybe we'll end with that one i can click assets down here and it's going to open up a your files section which i can drag and drop stuff like images and javascript and css or any file that i want to here and give me quick access to urls to use those on codepen and then there's some things that we give to you so let's say i wanted to have a picture of let's see playing cards i could do a search here and it's going

cover run and then i'll shrink it up a little bit so we can see the playing cards but we make those kind of things available to you and there's so much more but i'm gonna stop now i hope you made it this far thanks so much for listening code camp precode camp people uh it's so awesome to see some of you pop over to codepen and use it for stuff like learning and playing goodbye
