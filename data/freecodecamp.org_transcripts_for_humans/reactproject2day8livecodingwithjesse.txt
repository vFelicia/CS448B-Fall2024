With timestamps:

00:04 - hey everybody its Jesse and streaming a
00:09 - little bit earlier than normal today I
00:12 - have a meeting at my normal streaming
00:16 - time so it's actually my lunch break now
00:20 - which obviously I'm not taking today but
00:24 - it's also gonna be kind of a shorter
00:27 - stream so since I have a meeting in an
00:30 - hour and a half I want to try to keep
00:32 - this to about an hour to give me enough
00:35 - time I'm actually gonna walk over and
00:37 - meet with people face to face today so
00:39 - I'm not gonna meet um you know via my
00:46 - computer but yeah like I normally do and
00:49 - usually prefer to do so hopefully you
00:55 - know look you all got my message on
00:59 - Twitter so sorry for changing up the
01:01 - times on you
01:03 - the last stream and this stream
01:04 - hopefully tomorrow we'll be able to
01:06 - stream at the normal time so a lot has
01:10 - happened with the project since the last
01:12 - stream and Wow
01:16 - the analytics just jumped like from like
01:19 - 7 to 57 all right so let me catch you up
01:23 - as quickly as I can on what's changed
01:26 - and then let's try to get as much of the
01:28 - rest of the layout done so then we can
01:32 - actually start working on something a
01:33 - little bit more interesting so we got
01:36 - some some form data that we have to
01:38 - handle and uploads and we got to work
01:41 - with an API for a project management
01:44 - system so we have some some different
01:47 - stuff that we haven't really handled on
01:49 - on any of our streams yet that I really
01:52 - want to get to but I do need to go over
01:56 - a little bit of what happened with all
01:57 - these pull requests these awesome pull
02:00 - requests that we got since so much has
02:02 - changed so let me just bring this over
02:06 - and show you so these are for pull
02:11 - requests I'm just gonna give brief
02:13 - descriptions of these obviously you can
02:15 - go in yourself and see what has changed
02:19 - oh if there's also a live stream going
02:24 - on on Instagram so we do have someone
02:27 - watching right now on Instagram so if
02:30 - you want to see the code for this
02:32 - Instagram stream go to free code camps
02:35 - YouTube channel and you can see what's
02:36 - going on on my screen okay so the first
02:42 - pull requests so Sebastian basically
02:47 - fixed all the the app trees so if you'll
02:51 - see if you remember I didn't really have
02:54 - things organized that well so I had
02:58 - started to make I don't think I even
03:00 - made a components folder yet I think I
03:02 - did make a Styles folder but I still had
03:04 - some Styles in our main source directory
03:07 - so Sebastian went in native components
03:10 - directory put everything in the Styles
03:14 - directory that you know all our style
03:16 - sheets put all the components in here so
03:20 - it's a lot more organized definitely
03:23 - more clean I actually need to move so
03:27 - this is certain some later pull requests
03:28 - so I need to move this into the
03:30 - components as well but basically that
03:36 - was just like super super helpful the
03:43 - next and I'm sorry if I'm missing
03:45 - anything from these pull requests I
03:47 - apologize I'm just gonna try to get
03:49 - through this quickly so he can get to
03:51 - the code rohit made a i talked on friday
03:55 - about it would be really cool to have a
03:57 - component that depending on what you
04:00 - passed in as props
04:02 - it would make a card with basically any
04:06 - potentially with anything that you would
04:08 - normally have in a material design style
04:10 - card so check this actually let me bring
04:13 - it over from from n grok yeah and let me
04:17 - let me give you the I always forget to
04:21 - do this at the beginning so I have the N
04:23 - grog server running so it looks like
04:27 - maybe someone got on already I don't
04:29 - know maybe it's just me is that one
04:33 - person yeah it's probably just me I'm
04:36 - gonna paste this in the live chat hey
04:38 - everybody I see everyone's saying hi in
04:40 - the live chat hey thanks for watching
04:43 - everybody so there's the link if you
04:48 - can't check out the live chat right now
04:50 - it's this highlighted link right here
04:52 - I'll leave it up on the screen for just
04:53 - just a little bit longer give you a
04:57 - chance to you put it in a few if you
04:59 - want the URLs are there I understand why
05:04 - they have to be a long string of numbers
05:05 - like that because there's probably a lot
05:08 - of them but not that easy to type in
05:12 - alright so let me move this over now so
05:16 - we can get back to it so basically if
05:19 - you want to use if you want to be able
05:22 - to see the site you know live as I'm
05:25 - developing it go to that URL and if you
05:29 - go there you'll be able to see cool
05:31 - stuff like this okay so now I remember
05:33 - what else Sebastian did he gave me
05:37 - different placeholder images random ones
05:39 - so I think like this is always going to
05:43 - be architecture tech animals and
05:46 - probably like nature some landscapes or
05:48 - something so that's really cool let's
05:51 - see what we keep good didn't refresh for
05:55 - us oh well if it has refreshed since I
06:00 - merged this pull request this morning so
06:03 - it'll provide refresh again at some
06:04 - point so just let me show you so this is
06:07 - the card now so you can see this one has
06:09 - all the options in here so we can have
06:12 - you know the title with a little avatar
06:14 - image the main image here and overlay
06:17 - with the title just a title inside here
06:19 - our action buttons are content so really
06:23 - cool and then all this is controlled by
06:28 - the props so if you want to check out
06:30 - that component go ahead on github and
06:31 - you can check it out in more depth we
06:33 - will be using it as we go forward so
06:38 - you'll see more of it but that was just
06:41 - really awesome that was perfect exactly
06:43 - what I was kind of envisioning for that
06:46 - component so thank you and then we have
06:50 - to pull requests from from Kevin and one
06:56 - is you remember last week on Friday we
07:01 - finished up with this this form alright
07:04 - we had our form elements and the only
07:06 - thing that I didn't like was the button
07:08 - it's not it wasn't terrible but it just
07:11 - wasn't it didn't have the effect that I
07:12 - was used to with the other buttons
07:14 - because we had used materialized CSS
07:17 - before on previous projects and the
07:19 - material UI button styles were just a
07:21 - little different so now we have the
07:26 - exact styles and it's really cool that
07:30 - actually we can still use the same
07:32 - component name but and you can see it in
07:36 - the code but basically that component is
07:40 - now wrapped in a materialized button
07:43 - style component so just adds these this
07:48 - effect on to it so I think this actually
07:52 - looks better because of the mainly
07:54 - because of the drop shadow or the box
07:56 - shadow if you see it I don't know
08:02 - depending on the video quality you could
08:04 - probably see but anyway that's that's
08:07 - exactly what what I was thinking of what
08:10 - I wanted it to look like so that's
08:12 - awesome and then also we have testing so
08:15 - we now have a nightmare Jas and we have
08:22 - some test setup through there and I'm
08:24 - gonna be honest I have not done testing
08:26 - like this other than just reading about
08:29 - it or doing some a little bit of like a
08:31 - tutorial on testing but I haven't
08:33 - actually done any testing on my projects
08:34 - so this would be the first time I'm
08:36 - using that so I'm not even really sure
08:40 - how to use it at this point but I'll be
08:43 - figuring it out so I have one of the
08:46 - tests up right now so it seems pretty
08:50 - straightforward right so
08:53 - this is for the homepage test obviously
08:56 - home test is when we say it contains
08:59 - Resource Center right so we're checking
09:01 - to make sure it actually has the right
09:02 - title that's cool
09:04 - we're checking to make sure it's showing
09:06 - six cards based on the class of the the
09:12 - columns so it seems straightforward I'm
09:18 - gonna have to read up more on on how to
09:20 - do this now that we have it on the
09:22 - project but really cool that this is on
09:24 - here cuz after I saw this pull request I
09:26 - remembered that I had said I was going
09:28 - to try to do testing and then completely
09:30 - forgot about it so sorry for forgetting
09:33 - about it and thanks Kevin for the pull
09:36 - request and putting it in alright so
09:41 - this now looks good I mean we'll we'll
09:46 - come back and add in the correct text
09:49 - and everything in there when we go to
09:52 - make this form actually work but right
09:55 - now yawning I don't know why I'm yawning
10:01 - I actually got a decent amount of sleep
10:03 - last night this weekend was crazy
10:06 - I basically coded like Friday all day
10:09 - like I got him I went home from work
10:11 - earlier but then just immediately
10:12 - started coding and then all night and so
10:15 - like 3:30 a.m. and then I went to sleep
10:18 - woke up on Saturday and then coded all
10:21 - day Saturday and took Sunday completely
10:25 - off but I just I had a lot had a site
10:29 - that I had done previously in a database
10:32 - crashed on it and it was I just couldn't
10:34 - figure it out I was insane so I ended up
10:37 - just completely creating a new droplet
10:39 - on digital ocean and making a lamp stack
10:42 - installing WordPress put an SSL on it I
10:46 - just made a new subdomain pointed it to
10:48 - there and then pulled in that data
10:51 - through WordPress API into a react site
10:54 - like we did with our last project from
10:58 - the new then
10:59 - ooh drop that luckily I actually had the
11:03 - development version of the WordPress
11:05 - installation on a different server that
11:09 - that I used just like manage some shared
11:13 - hosting account with SiteGround and I
11:15 - had never deleted it which which end up
11:18 - being really good because I was able to
11:19 - just export everything from there and
11:21 - import it in so it took a lot of time
11:25 - and it was pretty crazy and then I
11:29 - decided hey let's like just update the
11:31 - react installation too and I tried to
11:33 - upgrade next and react to newer versions
11:36 - and just completely broke it so for
11:39 - hours that night the site was down
11:41 - luckily it was in the middle of the
11:43 - night and it's basically the the
11:46 - audience is in the same time zone as me
11:48 - so it probably was okay but I then I
11:54 - needed to get the site back up and
11:55 - running which is why I stayed up so late
11:57 - so anyway just a heads up as this that
12:02 - was what my weekend was like I'm sure
12:04 - some of you have been through similar
12:06 - things you know I guess it kind of
12:12 - happens sometimes site breaks you gotta
12:14 - fix it all right so let's go to I've got
12:21 - a posters done don't really have much
12:25 - okay service request form this is going
12:30 - to be a little bit more kind of in-depth
12:35 - in our other pages were so let me bring
12:38 - up
12:43 - there we go let me bring this over and
12:46 - so we all can see what's going on here
12:51 - so obviously this is gonna have a form
12:53 - but it's gonna have a lot more form
12:56 - inputs than our last form did and not
13:00 - only that but it's gonna have some some
13:02 - pages that we need to put in before that
13:05 - so when I was first building this it was
13:11 - requested of me that I make it so that
13:14 - users can't just go they don't go
13:17 - straight to the forum all right so the
13:21 - idea was that users were supposed to
13:27 - understand the process first before
13:30 - actually requesting things from the
13:32 - department so I did think that that was
13:36 - going to be pretty annoying after a
13:37 - while so I was able to put this skip to
13:40 - form button so it's just a slight slight
13:46 - annoyance of having one more clip but
13:47 - click but you can skip to this form so
13:49 - the actual form is is this so we're
13:53 - gonna have a bunch of regular text
13:56 - inputs some multi-line inputs we're
13:59 - gonna have a date date picker and then a
14:02 - file uploader then we're gonna have a
14:05 - bunch of check boxes a submit button and
14:09 - then we're gonna have a box here that's
14:11 - going to control whether or not you can
14:12 - submit the form so you have to check to
14:15 - say that they've read the planning guide
14:18 - all right all this form needs to be sent
14:22 - the data needs to be sent to someone in
14:28 - an email and then it also we need to
14:31 - send a confirmation to the user saying
14:34 - we've received your submission and then
14:36 - all the data also needs to be sent to
14:39 - our project management system and they
14:42 - have a REST API that we'll do that with
14:46 - so we're not gonna get into that today
14:49 - that's gonna be a bigger project but at
14:51 - least we can start to build some of it
14:52 - out so let's build
15:00 - let's see for this page yeah let's just
15:05 - do this page first I do at least want to
15:09 - show you what what else we're gonna have
15:11 - so we're gonna have this this guy this
15:14 - planning guide so we do right now I'll
15:17 - have having two pages of it or three
15:20 - pages so we have the planning guide page
15:22 - one then it lists a bunch of services
15:24 - then it lists the final page before you
15:28 - get to the request form there's also
15:30 - this other page of just terms so this is
15:33 - a glossary page so I'm thinking about
15:37 - maybe trying to combine some of these so
15:39 - they're not pages a bunch of different
15:42 - pages I think what happened at the time
15:45 - when I was developing this was I I think
15:51 - at one time early on I couldn't have
15:54 - anything that required a scroll it was
15:57 - really weird some of the stuff trying to
16:01 - figure out how to do this and make it
16:02 - work within you know the the system
16:05 - which was called J ICS from a company
16:09 - called Jenzabar so it was difficult
16:11 - trying to work within that so I think
16:14 - maybe that's why it ended up being
16:15 - separated so if there's not really a
16:19 - great reason why it's separated I don't
16:21 - see why this page and then that third
16:23 - page couldn't be combined but today
16:27 - let's actually work on that form that
16:30 - seems more interesting than just putting
16:32 - in blocks of text so oops
16:39 - alright so we're gonna have a lot I'm
16:43 - gonna move this over to my other screen
16:45 - and we're just gonna bring everything
16:51 - into here and build this form
16:56 - so there you go fuse service request
17:05 - okay oh let me check out the live chat
17:10 - as well I'm sorry I haven't really
17:12 - looked at anything in the live chat
17:13 - since I started taunt towing Laius hello
17:26 - Jesse redux and Redux augur bring me
17:28 - many difficulties where you have a
17:30 - course to mention this maybe that's
17:35 - something I'm interested in learning
17:37 - more about so it's a possibility I don't
17:39 - have I can't give you like officially
17:42 - when that will be but once I learn it if
17:48 - I feel confident enough to do a video
17:50 - about it I will
17:54 - Tunney mess it aside Jesse how are you
17:57 - I'm doing pretty good are you going
18:09 - if you need cos what Mac do you have
18:16 - it's an iMac is it late maybe like late
18:22 - 2015 iMac early 2015 I can't remember
18:28 - but it's it's an iMac I have a MacBook
18:35 - Pro too
18:44 - okay cool so Rowan says that this form
18:48 - looks pretty good as it was so the form
18:50 - that I just showed with you know having
18:52 - it inside the card we'll see actually
19:00 - let's let's think about that just for a
19:02 - minute
19:03 - do we want to keep this in the card you
19:08 - know we had said with the previous form
19:10 - that wasn't a card that we moved it and
19:12 - just had it you know right on the on the
19:15 - paper here in the back and not in a card
19:18 - now this card will be we won't be
19:21 - overlapping the header anymore because
19:23 - we're not gonna have this giant thick
19:24 - header so should we keep it in a card or
19:30 - should we put it you know just inside
19:34 - the page I don't know I kind of think if
19:38 - we're gonna get away from having
19:39 - everything in the cards maybe we
19:40 - shouldn't have it in a card so I think
19:45 - some of the issues that we talked about
19:46 - last week still remain for this as well
19:48 - and that it looks somewhat like a pop up
19:51 - the way it is now this is not exactly
19:57 - really what cards are for in material
20:01 - design so I don't know I'm gonna I'm
20:06 - actually I'm gonna leave it outside of a
20:08 - card and see how it looks and then we
20:11 - could always have the possibility of
20:13 - just wrapping it in a card later on but
20:17 - I would like to see how it looks not
20:19 - being in a card because I do I agree I
20:21 - think it looks it looks pretty good
20:23 - right now but just for the sake of
20:29 - consistency I want to see how it looks
20:33 - outside of the car
20:44 - all right so I'm going to I see there's
20:52 - some more questions in the lad chat but
20:53 - I'm going to work a little bit on this
20:55 - and then I'll come back to that so if
20:57 - you ask the question stick around I'll
20:58 - get to it later on yeah so I'd at least
21:07 - like to get most of this builds out
21:09 - before I have to stop so if you didn't
21:13 - catch it at the beginning this is all
21:14 - the streams only gonna be about an hour
21:15 - long okay I did have someone ask maybe
21:28 - listen to comment over the weekend and I
21:33 - don't know if I ever responded to him
21:34 - I'll have to make sure I tried to
21:35 - respond to as many comments as I could
21:37 - this weekend
21:38 - but I don't think I got to them all but
21:41 - they had asked about why are all these
21:43 - components like have like the class you
21:46 - know component why not why aren't they
21:47 - just like functional stateless
21:48 - components and I mean the short answer
21:51 - is like well a lot of these are just
21:53 - placeholders right now and if it ends up
21:55 - that we don't need them they have you
21:58 - know their own state or anything if it's
22:00 - possible to make them functional
22:02 - components then you know we'll do that
22:04 - but for right now it's just just a
22:08 - placeholder and some of them will
22:11 - definitely need to have more like this
22:12 - form one will obviously need to have
22:14 - more so so we'll leave it like that okay
22:21 - so probably the best thing to do will be
22:24 - to copy over some of this from
22:31 - [Music]
22:34 - another page let me see what was the
22:40 - page that we just had probably the story
22:43 - page this already does have some form
22:46 - elements on it so this will be the best
22:50 - and we do have some some of the imports
23:01 - that we'll need we could just bring in
23:03 - and let's pull in this whole container
23:17 - okay
23:22 - so we don't need any services actually
23:28 - we will need so we do have some text
23:33 - it's actually in the header now it just
23:35 - says please use this form to request
23:36 - services so I'm not gonna leave that
23:40 - text in the header just because of the
23:42 - way our headers definitely different for
23:44 - this so we will have some text at the
23:46 - top and right now I think this this is
23:52 - actually a H it's in each - okay we'll
23:56 - see what it's like it's an H to see if
23:58 - it even makes any sense as an h2 I'm
24:03 - gonna get rid of these paragraph tags
24:05 - and put it in h2 and we're gonna say
24:19 - okay now we can actually put in some of
24:26 - our fields so we're gonna have a lot of
24:33 - fields let's see so we are gonna have a
24:38 - name email from Department and so one
24:44 - two three four so I think we'll need for
24:47 - regular text fields let's check out
24:49 - material UI and see what they have in
24:54 - terms of fields
25:13 - okay you should I want to see okay I
25:23 - just wanted to double-check and see like
25:25 - your different types of fields how they
25:28 - were controlled so it looks like it's
25:29 - all controlled through through props
25:31 - which is great so we can just copy and
25:32 - paste our basic text field and then go
25:36 - back through if we want to format
25:37 - something I'm thinking you know I have a
25:42 - field for a phone number right so we
25:44 - probably only want to take numbers in
25:48 - the phone number field you know things
25:51 - like that I have a field for email so
25:53 - maybe we should check that it's actually
25:56 - an email so basic like form validation
25:59 - stuff alright so we can take these and
26:08 - copy then again because we need two more
26:10 - and then from there we want
26:20 - I have a lot of like large text
26:26 - multi-line text fields I guess it's
26:30 - better to have it in case users have a
26:33 - lot to say some some of these fields
26:35 - could be answered in less than you know
26:39 - just a few words but I guess potentially
26:41 - you might want to do more so let's leave
26:44 - it sub 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 so we need 8
26:48 - multi-line text fields so we have one
26:56 - already
27:04 - Sushi's need seven more so it's two
27:08 - three four five six seven
27:12 - this components going to be long me
27:16 - quite quite large I I suspect
27:19 - once it's finished then after that we
27:22 - need a date picker and we need a file
27:25 - uploader so let's check out
27:37 - in a separate day there we go date
27:39 - picker not a time alright so let's see
27:42 - what we want
27:56 - below the inputs I think I'm gonna go
28:00 - with the modal yeah let's go with the
28:07 - modal and we'll do it in portrait
28:11 - that'll be close as to what we have
28:13 - right now this is this is what we
28:16 - currently have so
28:24 - it won't be yeah it's not gonna be
28:28 - exactly the same but I'm okay with that
28:30 - I mean obviously we'll want to you know
28:33 - customize the colors but I think it'll
28:35 - actually end up being better I think I
28:41 - like this better I mean there's certain
28:47 - things about it I suppose that aren't
28:48 - quite okay so you can pick the year okay
28:56 - it looks like the the only thing that to
29:01 - me is not gonna be as easy is the
29:04 - ability to just pick the month here so
29:09 - you actually have to looks like go
29:12 - through a bit
29:19 - but I don't really see that as a huge
29:23 - huge problem okay so this this will work
29:31 - this date picker will definitely work so
29:36 - we're gonna have to bring in the date
29:38 - picker
29:48 - and let's bring in this woman
29:58 - and
30:02 - should have made the columns before but
30:05 - I well so let's do a call them first
30:22 - there we go alright and I'm gonna say
30:27 - that if something to see what it looks
30:28 - like ok cool
30:35 - hmm I don't want them all the way across
30:39 - so I had forgotten that I had these all
30:43 - set to be full with so let's change that
30:46 - right now
30:53 - there we go so we wanted still to be s
30:57 - slow but then we want to add an M right
31:01 - was it M what are we doing up here yeah
31:03 - M 6 so on medium screens we want this to
31:08 - take up half the screen meaning 6 of our
31:11 - 12 columns so now let's say that and see
31:15 - how it looks okay this is much more like
31:19 - I wanted it to look not really
31:27 - yeah not too bad okay cool but I didn't
31:36 - expect I think I missed I missed one too
31:42 - I think I was supposed to have eight of
31:46 - these so I must have missed one
31:53 - it's kind of embarrassing that I
31:55 - couldn't count to eight in front of
31:57 - everybody on YouTube all right so that's
32:02 - that's better I'm still not like what
32:09 - there's something about this that just
32:10 - does not look as nice and what is it
32:17 - maybe they just look too big
32:19 - actually let me check this for him so I
32:27 - just want to see what the color is on
32:29 - this font
32:37 - yeah I don't think I wanted I want it to
32:40 - be a little bit
32:45 - okay I think this font maybe is too
32:49 - light so I'm probably gonna end up
32:54 - changing the font I'm gonna finish you
32:59 - know creating our fields before I go in
33:01 - and do that but I think we did have a
33:05 - darker did we have a darker font all
33:09 - right no I'm not sure I want to see what
33:11 - font I had for this
33:25 - all right so I'm going to check the
33:27 - color that I'm using for this one I
33:28 - actually don't like either because it's
33:31 - it is an actual gray hex color I'd
33:33 - rather have black with set like I don't
33:39 - know maybe 54% transparency so I'll have
33:46 - to look after we get the layout done I'm
33:48 - gonna look at a project I did within the
33:52 - last few months that I know I did form
33:55 - stuff with and I was happy with the the
33:58 - color so I'll just go back and check
34:00 - that color but I think that's that's
34:04 - pretty much probably what's bothering
34:06 - any maybe these are a little bit longer
34:08 - than I'm used to but also probably
34:12 - better to see it with the real words
34:15 - here instead of having them all be the
34:17 - same let's see what else we need so we
34:24 - need our file upload and then a bunch of
34:26 - check boxes so hopefully there's a file
34:30 - uploader here let's see
34:46 - not seeing it
35:09 - it's okay if I'm missing it and someone
35:11 - has experience with with this framework
35:14 - material UI if it's in the framework
35:17 - please let me know otherwise I'm just
35:19 - gonna pull it from materialized CSS
35:23 - because I know that they have it and
35:27 - I've used it before it's gonna look look
35:31 - through this menu mmm excuse me again
35:38 - just more yawning so here's our check
35:46 - boxes which we will need those
35:54 - let me check the text field just really
35:56 - quickly I doubt it'll be here but it's
36:00 - possible yeah yeah definitely not there
36:05 - okay let's go to our check boxes then so
36:08 - we're gonna skip that for now I'll just
36:11 - put in something as a placeholder and
36:15 - we'll just need to put that in so let me
36:19 - just double up on this date picker for
36:22 - now
36:37 - I don't know I think I keep saying
36:39 - download button and it's upload I want
36:41 - people to upload things I don't know why
36:42 - I kept saying download all right so we
36:49 - want okay and I remember this so we're
36:56 - gonna use these checkboxes and I'm
36:58 - definitely gonna use these ones but I
37:01 - may change how the style of them at some
37:05 - point because it's definitely not
37:08 - exactly what we have so if you see what
37:11 - we're doing here it's a different
37:15 - different effect and maybe I'm just used
37:19 - to this because I've been using it but I
37:20 - kind of like this effect and let's see
37:25 - what this one I'm pretty sure this one
37:29 - is actually closer to what you're
37:31 - supposed to use with material design but
37:33 - this one is closer to what we've been
37:36 - using at the University for for all of
37:38 - our forms so at this point I think I
37:44 - would kind of just want to go with this
37:45 - but we'll see that'll be one of those
37:48 - things that if we have time to do it
37:50 - we'll do it otherwise I think that you
37:53 - know this will definitely be acceptable
37:55 - I mean this looks good it's just not
37:57 - gonna be exactly consistent with
37:59 - everything else we've done so we'll just
38:03 - add that to the list of maybe for now
38:10 - let's see where do we have the label at
38:13 - okay so we want the label on the right
38:17 - check box on the left okay
38:26 - I said check we're gonna import our
38:28 - checkbox
38:37 - all right so you have the checkbox
38:44 - and we'll pull in
38:56 - do we need these styles
39:10 - I'm just wondering whether or not I
39:12 - should bring in these styles but really
39:17 - all we're doing styles checkbox is just
39:19 - a margin bottom 16 let's say I'm not
39:26 - sure if I even want that margin so what
39:28 - we're gonna bring it in will leave out
39:29 - the style and see what kind of margin we
39:31 - have and we can always you know add in a
39:35 - margin later on right now I just want to
39:42 - kind of see how it looks like on the
39:43 - page so
39:53 - probably I think I want columns two
39:59 - columns with a bunch of the check boxes
40:01 - inside so we're gonna want another div
40:08 - with a class name just like we've been
40:14 - doing not really doing anything creative
40:18 - with our classes right now with our
40:21 - column classes so I'm just gonna add a
40:24 - few more of these just to give us an
40:28 - idea of what they're gonna look like and
40:35 - oops didn't get that top
40:41 - and put this here let's save that and
40:45 - see what it looks like oh and I forgot
40:50 - to take out the style so it's gonna be
40:54 - easier for me just to add so that was
40:55 - checkbox and I think at this point so
41:01 - let's do that
41:15 - whatever want to put this cost inside
41:17 - here right we'll see if it works in a
41:19 - second
41:20 - no don't want to put it outside don't
41:27 - want to put it inside the render
41:28 - function will not work because I didn't
41:29 - put this now oh sweet it did work cool
41:46 - all right not bad
41:51 - see that that other thing next with 2:59
41:55 - you die
42:04 - cool
42:06 - actually this this effect is kind of
42:08 - growing on me I like that little ripple
42:11 - a circular ripple effect I don't know
42:15 - what do you think let me know in the
42:18 - live chat and in the comments do you
42:20 - like this first effect which is
42:23 - basically like the Box completely goes
42:27 - away and then there's a check or do you
42:31 - like the circular ripple effect
42:46 - all right so let me know I'll give it we
42:50 - don't need to decide right now we can I
42:51 - mean right now this is going to be in
42:54 - there and maybe we'll change it later
42:55 - but I am just at least interested in
42:57 - what you all think about this okay so
43:02 - the only thing we need to add I mean
43:04 - other than making sure that we have
43:05 - these I'm not worried about all these
43:06 - yet because before this goes live this
43:10 - is going to change so I'm not gonna
43:12 - worry about whether I have the same
43:16 - number as on the current list because
43:19 - we're we're gonna take out some things
43:21 - maybe add things I'm not sure the only
43:25 - thing I'm missing is that last checkbox
43:27 - here so let's just add that in and then
43:29 - I'll take your questions
43:45 - I wonder if and get away with putting it
43:48 - right there what it'll look like it
43:54 - definitely needs a little little padding
43:56 - but that's about about where we want it
44:04 - okay cool well we basically have the
44:07 - layout for this the only thing that we
44:09 - didn't get done is this file upload so
44:14 - we're gonna have to pull this unless
44:16 - material you I have something that I'm
44:18 - missing we're gonna pull all the code
44:20 - from materialized and we're gonna use
44:23 - that for our file upload and that should
44:27 - look good I've used it before so yeah
44:31 - that's it not bad this was actually the
44:33 - page that I thought would take the most
44:35 - time and it it hasn't been too bad now
44:38 - what will take a lot of time is actually
44:40 - making this thing functional and do all
44:42 - the behind the scenes things that we
44:43 - wanted to do in terms of sending data
44:45 - where it needs to go that'll take a
44:47 - while but at least the layouts done and
44:50 - I'm not I don't really like the look of
44:52 - this right now so we'll see maybe we'll
44:54 - do something with this but all the
44:56 - pieces are there and we'll just kind of
44:59 - shift them around a bit as we need to
45:03 - okay so let me commit this let me check
45:07 - the status see yep that's what we've
45:10 - checked all right that's what we've
45:12 - worked on
45:37 - okay so now this is all on github and
45:42 - she all can see everything that we've
45:44 - done see all the code now actually let
45:52 - me let me bring over or is it that
46:06 - I did want to see I want to see if we
46:10 - got any new images now so I mention the
46:13 - beginning I was hoping this would
46:15 - refresh and we get an images but didn't
46:18 - refresh all right let me check the live
46:21 - chat now I'll try to get to as many
46:23 - questions as I can but right around you
46:27 - know when I hit the hour mark for this
46:29 - video so that's in about 15 minutes
46:32 - then I'm gonna have to wrap things up
46:34 - hopefully I can get through all your
46:36 - questions and now looks like we did have
46:43 - a few people in the Instagram stream but
46:47 - it looks like they left
46:49 - I always forget about that stream and I
46:51 - wonder if people just happen to stumble
46:53 - upon it I wonder if they even know
46:55 - what's going on since they can't see see
46:58 - the code I don't really know any other
47:03 - way to solve that I can't really take
47:06 - the time to check that frequently okay
47:15 - so Jung asks I'm trying to start
47:19 - learning web development any suggestions
47:22 - where I should start from free code
47:25 - can't so I really I mean I realize I'm
47:30 - streaming for the free code Kent YouTube
47:32 - channel but I really do think free code
47:34 - camp is a great starting point if you're
47:36 - just getting into web development even
47:39 - if you already have the basics down
47:41 - there's still a lot to do in free code
47:45 - camps so that's a great place other than
47:50 - that if you happen to not really like
47:51 - free code camp for some reason code
47:54 - Academy also is very beginner friendly
47:59 - anything that has browser-based
48:02 - learning I think is very user friendly
48:05 - because you don't get stuck trying to
48:08 - set up your development environment and
48:09 - you can actually get to do some you know
48:12 - HTML CSS JavaScript and see how you like
48:16 - it before you have to commit
48:18 - - like install a note on your machine
48:21 - and you know getting that up and running
48:23 - I don't know about you but I remember
48:25 - when I was first installed a note on my
48:28 - machine um years of god I don't know how
48:31 - many years ago was but it wasn't very
48:34 - intimidating and it was like am I gonna
48:37 - break my computer here like what what am
48:40 - i doing so that can be intimidating so
48:44 - those two resources are great there's
48:46 - also some YouTube channels that are good
48:49 - for beginners so learn code Academy is a
48:54 - good YouTube channel that has some nice
48:56 - stuff that I think is beginner friendly
48:59 - they have some advanced stuff too but
49:01 - and then dev tips
49:03 - it's another YouTube channel that has
49:05 - some pretty good things for beginners
49:08 - it's more geared towards CSS and less
49:13 - you know you you get you get some
49:15 - JavaScript but less JavaScript you know
49:17 - then then you'll get in learned code
49:20 - Academy and I don't really have a lot on
49:23 - my personal channel yet but I do plan
49:28 - hope hopefully at some point I can get
49:30 - some of those beginner tutorials up that
49:32 - I want to I'd like to include so I
49:38 - definitely I need to do some tutorials
49:40 - so this is just for a timeline for you
49:42 - all since I've been saying I was going
49:44 - to do these videos for a long time now I
49:48 - hope to have either some interns or
49:51 - student workers in the fall so coming up
49:55 - like making a month and I really want to
49:59 - make those videos so that every time I
50:02 - get new workers I don't have to train
50:05 - them continually on the same basic
50:07 - things I mean I still I'm gonna train
50:10 - them on things but there's a lot of
50:12 - really basic stuff that doesn't require
50:14 - me like personally taking the time to go
50:17 - through and that I want to do those in
50:19 - videos so it's going to be things like
50:21 - setting up your development
50:22 - environment basic you know get commands
50:27 - how to use github just a lot of those
50:30 - things that I use in my workflow and
50:34 - that anybody that wants to work in this
50:35 - department and work on the projects that
50:37 - we're working on will need to know to be
50:40 - able to contribute so those videos will
50:43 - probably be coming soon so assuming that
50:47 - I do have some students so I have some
50:49 - interest there's some students that are
50:50 - interested in learning and coming here
50:53 - doing some work and learning more so
50:54 - hopefully hopefully that will happen and
50:59 - there'll be an added benefit of there
51:03 - being some some tutorial videos on my
51:07 - channel for you all to check out if you
51:09 - like but aside from that there's a lot
51:11 - of great stuff on me or the other the
51:15 - other places that I mentioned are really
51:16 - good and a lot of those places are where
51:19 - I learned
51:25 - okay it looks like at the beginning when
51:28 - I was asking about keeping this form in
51:30 - the cart or not a few of you actually
51:34 - said keep it in the card so I'll keep
51:37 - that in mind well maybe I'll put it in
51:40 - it won't be too hard to put it inside a
51:41 - card so we can always put it back in the
51:45 - card if if we need to suppose where it
51:49 - says hey man shout out from Africa hey
51:52 - thanks for watching
51:57 - Philip asks when you work at home do you
52:02 - have an office or do you have to work
52:04 - where your kids are so actually I I just
52:09 - did kind of a different setup so for the
52:14 - the first few streams that I had done
52:16 - from home I was actually set up like
52:19 - right in my living room uh-huh
52:21 - so it was not really the best place now
52:25 - when I was working my wife had taken the
52:28 - kids somewhere else
52:29 - so it worked out but if the kids had
52:33 - been there it would have been hard to
52:35 - work now I have worked like that before
52:37 - and I just put headphones on and I
52:41 - turned the music up really loud and I've
52:44 - actually been so focused on my work that
52:46 - I've had like the neighbor stopped by
52:48 - came in my house sat down three feet
52:50 - away from me at a table talked to my
52:53 - wife for an hour and then left and I
52:54 - didn't even know she was there so I can
52:57 - focus enough to make that work but I
52:59 - recently moved to my basement in my
53:02 - laundry room and and that's a little bit
53:07 - more private and the kids are less
53:09 - likely to come down there the bad news
53:11 - is it's really noisy when the washer and
53:13 - dryer are running and it's also a
53:16 - basement so there's not really when I
53:18 - was in my living room I could open up I
53:21 - have a lot of windows there I could open
53:22 - up a lot of the windows I'd hear the
53:24 - birds and get a nice breeze blowing
53:26 - through so it felt like I was outside
53:27 - almost so there's a much nicer
53:30 - environment so we'll see how that goes
53:35 - I've always kind of thought about making
53:36 - a legit
53:37 - office but right now I do so much work
53:40 - you know in you know in the office here
53:43 - at the university that it doesn't really
53:45 - make sense for me to have Home Office
53:46 - right now my um is not that big I'm
53:49 - actually running out of space so as you
53:50 - all probably know from previous dreams I
53:53 - have four kids and right now there are
53:56 - two bedrooms for the four kids and which
54:00 - I guess isn't too bad but they're not
54:02 - really big bedrooms so I can't really
54:06 - take one of those and make it my office
54:08 - right now then we'd have one bedroom for
54:11 - all four kids so so we'll see that there
54:14 - have to be some construction involved if
54:16 - I were to have my own home office which
54:19 - isn't out of the question it may it may
54:20 - happen
54:27 - okay Roland says material design specs
54:30 - don't mention this anywhere of it even
54:31 - on Google's properties forms are usually
54:33 - in a card okay that's good to know
54:37 - Patrick doesn't think it'll look like
54:40 - you know okay so if you're not sure what
54:41 - we're talking about right now earlier on
54:43 - we were debating whether or not to have
54:45 - this form in a card like it is here or
54:49 - to put it directly on the page and it
54:52 - seems like so far everyone has said that
54:56 - they wanted in the card and not on the
54:58 - page so we may end up moving it into the
55:01 - card I was worried that it wasn't really
55:04 - you know proper material design style to
55:08 - put this in a card but evidently Google
55:12 - is using it in that way and you know
55:15 - putting forms and cards like that so off
55:18 - to check it out now that I think about
55:19 - it the new settings tab in Chrome I
55:26 - think that's I haven't been there in a
55:29 - long time but I thought they switched
55:30 - materials on yeah they did so the new
55:33 - settings tab in chrome is everything's
55:37 - in cards it's not exactly a forum but
55:40 - it's it's close enough so this is what
55:46 - I'm talking about
55:46 - settings I mean there are form elements
55:53 - within this so yeah that that seems kind
55:58 - of legit like it could it could work so
56:02 - it may end up doing that
56:08 - okay so Kevin says I think it's better
56:10 - in the paper for consistency sake also
56:12 - okay so we do have some some differing
56:15 - opinions here off to think about it
56:29 - Rohan says keep the background off
56:31 - whitish it looks better that way yeah it
56:35 - does do I have to see what the
56:41 - background was I thought I had it off it
56:45 - is off right white right now right it's
56:48 - I guess whatever the default is for
56:50 - material UI is what it is right now
56:53 - which should be slightly off off white I
56:56 - think yeah Sebastian said move the
57:04 - button component to the component folder
57:07 - I will I will move it in there I don't
57:11 - want to just move it right now because I
57:12 - don't have time to make sure that it's
57:14 - it's properly I'll have to change the
57:18 - import to where it's in I think it's
57:21 - only in one view right now actually now
57:23 - it's in two right we just used it again
57:25 - so I want to make sure I have enough
57:28 - time to change those when I move it but
57:30 - I will move it alright Roland says you
57:36 - can use h4 h5 for description just use
57:39 - h1 for the service request form yeah
57:45 - that makes sense maybe I'll go do that I
57:47 - am gonna kind of change this a bit and
57:50 - make it look better and if we end up
57:53 - putting this in a card then we'll have
57:56 - to see what we do about this
58:04 - Jordan asks why the early stream
58:07 - imperative associates a meeting yeah
58:09 - basically I have a meeting at 2:00 and I
58:14 - was supposed to have another meeting at
58:16 - 3:00 that ended up getting canceled so I
58:19 - but I figured it'd better just do the
58:21 - early stream that way I know I get it in
58:24 - in case the the other meeting runs long
58:26 - I don't expect it to but I really have
58:29 - no idea how long the other meetings
58:30 - gonna be so I was safer to just stream
58:34 - early let's see if someone in the live
58:38 - stream a Malia how's it going
58:44 - so someone someone who used to work in
58:49 - my department actually just watched on
58:53 - on Instagram so those cool she did web
58:56 - stuff too so that was good she moved on
59:02 - and and now I think she has a better job
59:05 - than all of us in the department so I'm
59:07 - happy for
59:19 - okay so Kevin says there is something in
59:23 - materiai that seat that works for a file
59:25 - picker hasn't tested it yet and I put he
59:29 - put the link in okay awesome off to
59:30 - check that out
59:31 - Oh Sebastian said I can add type file to
59:41 - a text field
59:42 - well that will that work will that look
59:45 - I'll have to check it out later right
59:48 - now yeah I only have another minute left
59:50 - but office it off to check out how that
59:53 - that looks okay Umberto likes the
59:57 - circular riffle so - Sebastian okay
60:02 - since the rotate box thing looks choppy
60:04 - yeah I think it looks a little bit
60:08 - better in other implementations that was
60:11 - one of my early implementations of it
60:18 - but yeah it is choppier for sure
60:33 - okay it looks like everybody alright
60:41 - pretty much everybody likes the ripple
60:43 - effect on the checkbook so I think I
60:45 - will end up sticking with that and I
60:49 - think it'll be fun I'm not super upset
60:52 - if I have a slightly different effect on
60:54 - checkboxes for different sites as I go
60:58 - back and update old sites I can always
61:02 - just change it if I need to so I think
61:09 - I'll keep it with the ripple effect
61:16 - Vinicio says Jessie do you think
61:19 - JavaScript would be the best language to
61:21 - begin man I don't I'm not sure if it
61:28 - depends on what you want to do if you
61:30 - know you want to do web development then
61:33 - yeah go with JavaScript because that's
61:36 - that's what you're going to be using if
61:38 - you want to just get more into like
61:41 - programming in general then something
61:44 - else like like Python would be maybe
61:49 - easier to pick up I think you know a lot
61:53 - of places start with Python so yeah I
61:57 - did but it does it just depends on what
61:58 - you want to do so I kind of I started
62:01 - with JavaScript for the most part and it
62:06 - turned out all right for me I guess so
62:09 - it's definitely you know it's doable a
62:11 - lot of people start with JavaScript but
62:15 - I think Python would also be a good
62:19 - alternative if you weren't if you didn't
62:21 - really want to get into web design
62:23 - specifically then maybe Python would be
62:25 - better
62:39 - okay cool so Patrick says the file
62:42 - picker is in the docks under the race
62:44 - button stuff
62:52 - I want to see this
63:13 - unless I'm not seeing it maybe I'm
63:20 - looking in the wrong place
63:28 - there we go all right cool
63:35 - it's just the first one okay cool so you
63:40 - just wrap the input inside the race
63:44 - button all right good to know so this is
63:48 - what we use then and awesome awesome
63:56 - that'll work thank you
63:58 - Patrick for find a desk it's kind of a
64:00 - little weird the place where it I don't
64:02 - I mean I don't know but that just wasn't
64:05 - like obvious to me that I would find the
64:08 - file input under race button oh well it
64:16 - seems like it would make more sense if
64:18 - they had forms as a category and then on
64:21 - the drop-down you had all the different
64:22 - types I think it would make it you clean
64:27 - it up a lot more you think they're
64:29 - taking full requests for their
64:30 - documentation probably they might not
64:33 - care those since they're coming out with
64:34 - a new version for the old version but I
64:37 - think it would be better better
64:40 - organized like that
64:53 - okay cool so in regard to what we're
64:56 - talking about earlier with me trying to
64:58 - get work done with all my kids and no
65:00 - office Philip says I'm right there with
65:02 - you I have three kids and doing side
65:04 - projects is challenging yeah you need
65:10 - CEO says you have four kids that's
65:12 - awesome I have two little girls yeah
65:14 - that's cool isn't it
65:17 - having kids is it's like one of the
65:21 - hardest things I've ever done but it's
65:23 - also one of those awesome things I've
65:25 - ever done and my kids are still little
65:28 - I'm sure it even it gets harder and and
65:30 - more awesome as they get older Ellen
65:37 - says office in a shed or garage says you
65:41 - might have to do something about the
65:42 - network but it might work actually
65:44 - that's that is a good idea
65:48 - my sheds in terrible shape so there's no
65:51 - way I can put any electronic stuff in my
65:54 - shed cuz the roof has holes in it but I
65:58 - really really want to add a girl I don't
66:01 - currently don't have a garage so I
66:03 - really would like a garage and maybe I
66:06 - should keep that in mind if I do end up
66:08 - building a garage to make a space for an
66:12 - office there
66:22 - okay kevin says on the card /page debate
66:25 - there is a paper component that just
66:26 - adds the depth effect okay cool I have
66:30 - to check that out so I won't actually
66:31 - have to like put it in in a card we can
66:34 - just add some depth to the paper
66:39 - Rowan says meetings the non-technical
66:42 - bane of developers that's for sure I
66:45 - like I just can't take all these
66:49 - meetings there's so many meetings and
66:54 - like some days I feel like I get no
66:56 - coding done because there's too many
67:00 - meetings and you you have to get ready
67:02 - for a meeting and then you have the
67:03 - meeting and then after the meeting you
67:05 - usually have to do something based on
67:06 - what happened in the meeting it's just
67:08 - like and then there's all the emails
67:11 - back and forth trying to find a good
67:13 - time to schedule the meeting for its so
67:16 - it's just crazy
67:18 - all the time spent on meetings I think I
67:22 - mentioned this before in a stream but
67:23 - just in case I haven't I
67:25 - I would love to make like a scheduling
67:28 - app or like maybe a Chrome extension
67:31 - that put automatically on your calendar
67:35 - the price of the meeting so it would
67:38 - just take how many people are in the
67:40 - meeting and then based on like an
67:43 - average salary or something per hour it
67:46 - would tell you how much that meeting is
67:48 - gonna cost and then I think there would
67:51 - be less meetings because people wouldn't
67:52 - just say like okay I'm gonna have like
67:54 - 10 people in this meeting and we're
67:56 - gonna meet for two hours instead they'd
67:57 - say like wow this is a $4,000 meeting
68:00 - maybe we don't need this this $4,000
68:02 - meeting right now anyway
68:05 - I I think it'd be a good idea I don't
68:07 - and I'm it's not like I made this idea
68:09 - up I'm pretty sure that I saw this
68:11 - somewhere in the internet that someone
68:12 - had done something similar so I don't
68:14 - want to take credit for it but I have no
68:16 - idea where I read it
68:31 - how everyone says meetings discussing
68:33 - previous meetings those are true beauty
68:35 - oh my goodness yeah I hate when I have a
68:37 - meeting about something that we've
68:39 - already decided in previous meetings and
68:41 - we're just trying to remember what we
68:42 - decided in that meeting since like
68:45 - especially when like I remember for sure
68:48 - what happened in that meeting and it's
68:49 - just a matter of trying to convince
68:50 - everybody else that we actually did
68:52 - agree to that thing it's especially
68:55 - frustrating when it's about some some
68:58 - feature on something I'm building
69:09 - Tiffany said that meeting ideas
69:11 - hilarious I know wouldn't that be good
69:13 - right and I feel free any of you to
69:16 - steal that idea and build something with
69:19 - that and if you do then I I will use it
69:23 - but maybe oh I've actually like done it
69:28 - on paper like I've been in a meeting
69:30 - before like calculating how much
69:33 - meetings cost and then I'll usually just
69:36 - like text somebody or write it on a
69:38 - paper and show somebody next to me and
69:40 - we'll we'll smile about it in the heat
70:01 - all right well I made it through all the
70:05 - questions and I think I've gone over the
70:08 - time I said I was gonna gonna go so what
70:11 - else isn't it I'm always doing that so I
70:13 - really do have to go now because I want
70:17 - to get to the meeting and make sure I'm
70:20 - prepared for that so thank you all for
70:24 - for watching especially with the the
70:28 - time change that was kind of late notice
70:30 - so I appreciate y'all being ok with that
70:34 - and joining in and participating
70:36 - especially thank you to everyone who
70:38 - submitted pull requests over the weekend
70:40 - super helpful it's making this project
70:43 - just really awesome and I'll be back
70:47 - tomorrow hopefully at the proper time
70:49 - tomorrow which is 2 p.m. eastern time
70:51 - until then I hope you all have a great
70:54 - day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and streaming a little bit earlier than normal today I have a meeting at my normal streaming time so it's actually my lunch break now which obviously I'm not taking today but it's also gonna be kind of a shorter stream so since I have a meeting in an hour and a half I want to try to keep this to about an hour to give me enough time I'm actually gonna walk over and meet with people face to face today so I'm not gonna meet um you know via my computer but yeah like I normally do and usually prefer to do so hopefully you know look you all got my message on Twitter so sorry for changing up the times on you the last stream and this stream hopefully tomorrow we'll be able to stream at the normal time so a lot has happened with the project since the last stream and Wow the analytics just jumped like from like 7 to 57 all right so let me catch you up as quickly as I can on what's changed and then let's try to get as much of the rest of the layout done so then we can actually start working on something a little bit more interesting so we got some some form data that we have to handle and uploads and we got to work with an API for a project management system so we have some some different stuff that we haven't really handled on on any of our streams yet that I really want to get to but I do need to go over a little bit of what happened with all these pull requests these awesome pull requests that we got since so much has changed so let me just bring this over and show you so these are for pull requests I'm just gonna give brief descriptions of these obviously you can go in yourself and see what has changed oh if there's also a live stream going on on Instagram so we do have someone watching right now on Instagram so if you want to see the code for this Instagram stream go to free code camps YouTube channel and you can see what's going on on my screen okay so the first pull requests so Sebastian basically fixed all the the app trees so if you'll see if you remember I didn't really have things organized that well so I had started to make I don't think I even made a components folder yet I think I did make a Styles folder but I still had some Styles in our main source directory so Sebastian went in native components directory put everything in the Styles directory that you know all our style sheets put all the components in here so it's a lot more organized definitely more clean I actually need to move so this is certain some later pull requests so I need to move this into the components as well but basically that was just like super super helpful the next and I'm sorry if I'm missing anything from these pull requests I apologize I'm just gonna try to get through this quickly so he can get to the code rohit made a i talked on friday about it would be really cool to have a component that depending on what you passed in as props it would make a card with basically any potentially with anything that you would normally have in a material design style card so check this actually let me bring it over from from n grok yeah and let me let me give you the I always forget to do this at the beginning so I have the N grog server running so it looks like maybe someone got on already I don't know maybe it's just me is that one person yeah it's probably just me I'm gonna paste this in the live chat hey everybody I see everyone's saying hi in the live chat hey thanks for watching everybody so there's the link if you can't check out the live chat right now it's this highlighted link right here I'll leave it up on the screen for just just a little bit longer give you a chance to you put it in a few if you want the URLs are there I understand why they have to be a long string of numbers like that because there's probably a lot of them but not that easy to type in alright so let me move this over now so we can get back to it so basically if you want to use if you want to be able to see the site you know live as I'm developing it go to that URL and if you go there you'll be able to see cool stuff like this okay so now I remember what else Sebastian did he gave me different placeholder images random ones so I think like this is always going to be architecture tech animals and probably like nature some landscapes or something so that's really cool let's see what we keep good didn't refresh for us oh well if it has refreshed since I merged this pull request this morning so it'll provide refresh again at some point so just let me show you so this is the card now so you can see this one has all the options in here so we can have you know the title with a little avatar image the main image here and overlay with the title just a title inside here our action buttons are content so really cool and then all this is controlled by the props so if you want to check out that component go ahead on github and you can check it out in more depth we will be using it as we go forward so you'll see more of it but that was just really awesome that was perfect exactly what I was kind of envisioning for that component so thank you and then we have to pull requests from from Kevin and one is you remember last week on Friday we finished up with this this form alright we had our form elements and the only thing that I didn't like was the button it's not it wasn't terrible but it just wasn't it didn't have the effect that I was used to with the other buttons because we had used materialized CSS before on previous projects and the material UI button styles were just a little different so now we have the exact styles and it's really cool that actually we can still use the same component name but and you can see it in the code but basically that component is now wrapped in a materialized button style component so just adds these this effect on to it so I think this actually looks better because of the mainly because of the drop shadow or the box shadow if you see it I don't know depending on the video quality you could probably see but anyway that's that's exactly what what I was thinking of what I wanted it to look like so that's awesome and then also we have testing so we now have a nightmare Jas and we have some test setup through there and I'm gonna be honest I have not done testing like this other than just reading about it or doing some a little bit of like a tutorial on testing but I haven't actually done any testing on my projects so this would be the first time I'm using that so I'm not even really sure how to use it at this point but I'll be figuring it out so I have one of the tests up right now so it seems pretty straightforward right so this is for the homepage test obviously home test is when we say it contains Resource Center right so we're checking to make sure it actually has the right title that's cool we're checking to make sure it's showing six cards based on the class of the the columns so it seems straightforward I'm gonna have to read up more on on how to do this now that we have it on the project but really cool that this is on here cuz after I saw this pull request I remembered that I had said I was going to try to do testing and then completely forgot about it so sorry for forgetting about it and thanks Kevin for the pull request and putting it in alright so this now looks good I mean we'll we'll come back and add in the correct text and everything in there when we go to make this form actually work but right now yawning I don't know why I'm yawning I actually got a decent amount of sleep last night this weekend was crazy I basically coded like Friday all day like I got him I went home from work earlier but then just immediately started coding and then all night and so like 330 a.m. and then I went to sleep woke up on Saturday and then coded all day Saturday and took Sunday completely off but I just I had a lot had a site that I had done previously in a database crashed on it and it was I just couldn't figure it out I was insane so I ended up just completely creating a new droplet on digital ocean and making a lamp stack installing WordPress put an SSL on it I just made a new subdomain pointed it to there and then pulled in that data through WordPress API into a react site like we did with our last project from the new then ooh drop that luckily I actually had the development version of the WordPress installation on a different server that that I used just like manage some shared hosting account with SiteGround and I had never deleted it which which end up being really good because I was able to just export everything from there and import it in so it took a lot of time and it was pretty crazy and then I decided hey let's like just update the react installation too and I tried to upgrade next and react to newer versions and just completely broke it so for hours that night the site was down luckily it was in the middle of the night and it's basically the the audience is in the same time zone as me so it probably was okay but I then I needed to get the site back up and running which is why I stayed up so late so anyway just a heads up as this that was what my weekend was like I'm sure some of you have been through similar things you know I guess it kind of happens sometimes site breaks you gotta fix it all right so let's go to I've got a posters done don't really have much okay service request form this is going to be a little bit more kind of indepth in our other pages were so let me bring up there we go let me bring this over and so we all can see what's going on here so obviously this is gonna have a form but it's gonna have a lot more form inputs than our last form did and not only that but it's gonna have some some pages that we need to put in before that so when I was first building this it was requested of me that I make it so that users can't just go they don't go straight to the forum all right so the idea was that users were supposed to understand the process first before actually requesting things from the department so I did think that that was going to be pretty annoying after a while so I was able to put this skip to form button so it's just a slight slight annoyance of having one more clip but click but you can skip to this form so the actual form is is this so we're gonna have a bunch of regular text inputs some multiline inputs we're gonna have a date date picker and then a file uploader then we're gonna have a bunch of check boxes a submit button and then we're gonna have a box here that's going to control whether or not you can submit the form so you have to check to say that they've read the planning guide all right all this form needs to be sent the data needs to be sent to someone in an email and then it also we need to send a confirmation to the user saying we've received your submission and then all the data also needs to be sent to our project management system and they have a REST API that we'll do that with so we're not gonna get into that today that's gonna be a bigger project but at least we can start to build some of it out so let's build let's see for this page yeah let's just do this page first I do at least want to show you what what else we're gonna have so we're gonna have this this guy this planning guide so we do right now I'll have having two pages of it or three pages so we have the planning guide page one then it lists a bunch of services then it lists the final page before you get to the request form there's also this other page of just terms so this is a glossary page so I'm thinking about maybe trying to combine some of these so they're not pages a bunch of different pages I think what happened at the time when I was developing this was I I think at one time early on I couldn't have anything that required a scroll it was really weird some of the stuff trying to figure out how to do this and make it work within you know the the system which was called J ICS from a company called Jenzabar so it was difficult trying to work within that so I think maybe that's why it ended up being separated so if there's not really a great reason why it's separated I don't see why this page and then that third page couldn't be combined but today let's actually work on that form that seems more interesting than just putting in blocks of text so oops alright so we're gonna have a lot I'm gonna move this over to my other screen and we're just gonna bring everything into here and build this form so there you go fuse service request okay oh let me check out the live chat as well I'm sorry I haven't really looked at anything in the live chat since I started taunt towing Laius hello Jesse redux and Redux augur bring me many difficulties where you have a course to mention this maybe that's something I'm interested in learning more about so it's a possibility I don't have I can't give you like officially when that will be but once I learn it if I feel confident enough to do a video about it I will Tunney mess it aside Jesse how are you I'm doing pretty good are you going if you need cos what Mac do you have it's an iMac is it late maybe like late 2015 iMac early 2015 I can't remember but it's it's an iMac I have a MacBook Pro too okay cool so Rowan says that this form looks pretty good as it was so the form that I just showed with you know having it inside the card we'll see actually let's let's think about that just for a minute do we want to keep this in the card you know we had said with the previous form that wasn't a card that we moved it and just had it you know right on the on the paper here in the back and not in a card now this card will be we won't be overlapping the header anymore because we're not gonna have this giant thick header so should we keep it in a card or should we put it you know just inside the page I don't know I kind of think if we're gonna get away from having everything in the cards maybe we shouldn't have it in a card so I think some of the issues that we talked about last week still remain for this as well and that it looks somewhat like a pop up the way it is now this is not exactly really what cards are for in material design so I don't know I'm gonna I'm actually I'm gonna leave it outside of a card and see how it looks and then we could always have the possibility of just wrapping it in a card later on but I would like to see how it looks not being in a card because I do I agree I think it looks it looks pretty good right now but just for the sake of consistency I want to see how it looks outside of the car all right so I'm going to I see there's some more questions in the lad chat but I'm going to work a little bit on this and then I'll come back to that so if you ask the question stick around I'll get to it later on yeah so I'd at least like to get most of this builds out before I have to stop so if you didn't catch it at the beginning this is all the streams only gonna be about an hour long okay I did have someone ask maybe listen to comment over the weekend and I don't know if I ever responded to him I'll have to make sure I tried to respond to as many comments as I could this weekend but I don't think I got to them all but they had asked about why are all these components like have like the class you know component why not why aren't they just like functional stateless components and I mean the short answer is like well a lot of these are just placeholders right now and if it ends up that we don't need them they have you know their own state or anything if it's possible to make them functional components then you know we'll do that but for right now it's just just a placeholder and some of them will definitely need to have more like this form one will obviously need to have more so so we'll leave it like that okay so probably the best thing to do will be to copy over some of this from another page let me see what was the page that we just had probably the story page this already does have some form elements on it so this will be the best and we do have some some of the imports that we'll need we could just bring in and let's pull in this whole container okay so we don't need any services actually we will need so we do have some text it's actually in the header now it just says please use this form to request services so I'm not gonna leave that text in the header just because of the way our headers definitely different for this so we will have some text at the top and right now I think this this is actually a H it's in each okay we'll see what it's like it's an H to see if it even makes any sense as an h2 I'm gonna get rid of these paragraph tags and put it in h2 and we're gonna say okay now we can actually put in some of our fields so we're gonna have a lot of fields let's see so we are gonna have a name email from Department and so one two three four so I think we'll need for regular text fields let's check out material UI and see what they have in terms of fields okay you should I want to see okay I just wanted to doublecheck and see like your different types of fields how they were controlled so it looks like it's all controlled through through props which is great so we can just copy and paste our basic text field and then go back through if we want to format something I'm thinking you know I have a field for a phone number right so we probably only want to take numbers in the phone number field you know things like that I have a field for email so maybe we should check that it's actually an email so basic like form validation stuff alright so we can take these and copy then again because we need two more and then from there we want I have a lot of like large text multiline text fields I guess it's better to have it in case users have a lot to say some some of these fields could be answered in less than you know just a few words but I guess potentially you might want to do more so let's leave it sub 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 so we need 8 multiline text fields so we have one already Sushi's need seven more so it's two three four five six seven this components going to be long me quite quite large I I suspect once it's finished then after that we need a date picker and we need a file uploader so let's check out in a separate day there we go date picker not a time alright so let's see what we want below the inputs I think I'm gonna go with the modal yeah let's go with the modal and we'll do it in portrait that'll be close as to what we have right now this is this is what we currently have so it won't be yeah it's not gonna be exactly the same but I'm okay with that I mean obviously we'll want to you know customize the colors but I think it'll actually end up being better I think I like this better I mean there's certain things about it I suppose that aren't quite okay so you can pick the year okay it looks like the the only thing that to me is not gonna be as easy is the ability to just pick the month here so you actually have to looks like go through a bit but I don't really see that as a huge huge problem okay so this this will work this date picker will definitely work so we're gonna have to bring in the date picker and let's bring in this woman and should have made the columns before but I well so let's do a call them first there we go alright and I'm gonna say that if something to see what it looks like ok cool hmm I don't want them all the way across so I had forgotten that I had these all set to be full with so let's change that right now there we go so we wanted still to be s slow but then we want to add an M right was it M what are we doing up here yeah M 6 so on medium screens we want this to take up half the screen meaning 6 of our 12 columns so now let's say that and see how it looks okay this is much more like I wanted it to look not really yeah not too bad okay cool but I didn't expect I think I missed I missed one too I think I was supposed to have eight of these so I must have missed one it's kind of embarrassing that I couldn't count to eight in front of everybody on YouTube all right so that's that's better I'm still not like what there's something about this that just does not look as nice and what is it maybe they just look too big actually let me check this for him so I just want to see what the color is on this font yeah I don't think I wanted I want it to be a little bit okay I think this font maybe is too light so I'm probably gonna end up changing the font I'm gonna finish you know creating our fields before I go in and do that but I think we did have a darker did we have a darker font all right no I'm not sure I want to see what font I had for this all right so I'm going to check the color that I'm using for this one I actually don't like either because it's it is an actual gray hex color I'd rather have black with set like I don't know maybe 54% transparency so I'll have to look after we get the layout done I'm gonna look at a project I did within the last few months that I know I did form stuff with and I was happy with the the color so I'll just go back and check that color but I think that's that's pretty much probably what's bothering any maybe these are a little bit longer than I'm used to but also probably better to see it with the real words here instead of having them all be the same let's see what else we need so we need our file upload and then a bunch of check boxes so hopefully there's a file uploader here let's see not seeing it it's okay if I'm missing it and someone has experience with with this framework material UI if it's in the framework please let me know otherwise I'm just gonna pull it from materialized CSS because I know that they have it and I've used it before it's gonna look look through this menu mmm excuse me again just more yawning so here's our check boxes which we will need those let me check the text field just really quickly I doubt it'll be here but it's possible yeah yeah definitely not there okay let's go to our check boxes then so we're gonna skip that for now I'll just put in something as a placeholder and we'll just need to put that in so let me just double up on this date picker for now I don't know I think I keep saying download button and it's upload I want people to upload things I don't know why I kept saying download all right so we want okay and I remember this so we're gonna use these checkboxes and I'm definitely gonna use these ones but I may change how the style of them at some point because it's definitely not exactly what we have so if you see what we're doing here it's a different different effect and maybe I'm just used to this because I've been using it but I kind of like this effect and let's see what this one I'm pretty sure this one is actually closer to what you're supposed to use with material design but this one is closer to what we've been using at the University for for all of our forms so at this point I think I would kind of just want to go with this but we'll see that'll be one of those things that if we have time to do it we'll do it otherwise I think that you know this will definitely be acceptable I mean this looks good it's just not gonna be exactly consistent with everything else we've done so we'll just add that to the list of maybe for now let's see where do we have the label at okay so we want the label on the right check box on the left okay I said check we're gonna import our checkbox all right so you have the checkbox and we'll pull in do we need these styles I'm just wondering whether or not I should bring in these styles but really all we're doing styles checkbox is just a margin bottom 16 let's say I'm not sure if I even want that margin so what we're gonna bring it in will leave out the style and see what kind of margin we have and we can always you know add in a margin later on right now I just want to kind of see how it looks like on the page so probably I think I want columns two columns with a bunch of the check boxes inside so we're gonna want another div with a class name just like we've been doing not really doing anything creative with our classes right now with our column classes so I'm just gonna add a few more of these just to give us an idea of what they're gonna look like and oops didn't get that top and put this here let's save that and see what it looks like oh and I forgot to take out the style so it's gonna be easier for me just to add so that was checkbox and I think at this point so let's do that whatever want to put this cost inside here right we'll see if it works in a second no don't want to put it outside don't want to put it inside the render function will not work because I didn't put this now oh sweet it did work cool all right not bad see that that other thing next with 259 you die cool actually this this effect is kind of growing on me I like that little ripple a circular ripple effect I don't know what do you think let me know in the live chat and in the comments do you like this first effect which is basically like the Box completely goes away and then there's a check or do you like the circular ripple effect all right so let me know I'll give it we don't need to decide right now we can I mean right now this is going to be in there and maybe we'll change it later but I am just at least interested in what you all think about this okay so the only thing we need to add I mean other than making sure that we have these I'm not worried about all these yet because before this goes live this is going to change so I'm not gonna worry about whether I have the same number as on the current list because we're we're gonna take out some things maybe add things I'm not sure the only thing I'm missing is that last checkbox here so let's just add that in and then I'll take your questions I wonder if and get away with putting it right there what it'll look like it definitely needs a little little padding but that's about about where we want it okay cool well we basically have the layout for this the only thing that we didn't get done is this file upload so we're gonna have to pull this unless material you I have something that I'm missing we're gonna pull all the code from materialized and we're gonna use that for our file upload and that should look good I've used it before so yeah that's it not bad this was actually the page that I thought would take the most time and it it hasn't been too bad now what will take a lot of time is actually making this thing functional and do all the behind the scenes things that we wanted to do in terms of sending data where it needs to go that'll take a while but at least the layouts done and I'm not I don't really like the look of this right now so we'll see maybe we'll do something with this but all the pieces are there and we'll just kind of shift them around a bit as we need to okay so let me commit this let me check the status see yep that's what we've checked all right that's what we've worked on okay so now this is all on github and she all can see everything that we've done see all the code now actually let me let me bring over or is it that I did want to see I want to see if we got any new images now so I mention the beginning I was hoping this would refresh and we get an images but didn't refresh all right let me check the live chat now I'll try to get to as many questions as I can but right around you know when I hit the hour mark for this video so that's in about 15 minutes then I'm gonna have to wrap things up hopefully I can get through all your questions and now looks like we did have a few people in the Instagram stream but it looks like they left I always forget about that stream and I wonder if people just happen to stumble upon it I wonder if they even know what's going on since they can't see see the code I don't really know any other way to solve that I can't really take the time to check that frequently okay so Jung asks I'm trying to start learning web development any suggestions where I should start from free code can't so I really I mean I realize I'm streaming for the free code Kent YouTube channel but I really do think free code camp is a great starting point if you're just getting into web development even if you already have the basics down there's still a lot to do in free code camps so that's a great place other than that if you happen to not really like free code camp for some reason code Academy also is very beginner friendly anything that has browserbased learning I think is very user friendly because you don't get stuck trying to set up your development environment and you can actually get to do some you know HTML CSS JavaScript and see how you like it before you have to commit like install a note on your machine and you know getting that up and running I don't know about you but I remember when I was first installed a note on my machine um years of god I don't know how many years ago was but it wasn't very intimidating and it was like am I gonna break my computer here like what what am i doing so that can be intimidating so those two resources are great there's also some YouTube channels that are good for beginners so learn code Academy is a good YouTube channel that has some nice stuff that I think is beginner friendly they have some advanced stuff too but and then dev tips it's another YouTube channel that has some pretty good things for beginners it's more geared towards CSS and less you know you you get you get some JavaScript but less JavaScript you know then then you'll get in learned code Academy and I don't really have a lot on my personal channel yet but I do plan hope hopefully at some point I can get some of those beginner tutorials up that I want to I'd like to include so I definitely I need to do some tutorials so this is just for a timeline for you all since I've been saying I was going to do these videos for a long time now I hope to have either some interns or student workers in the fall so coming up like making a month and I really want to make those videos so that every time I get new workers I don't have to train them continually on the same basic things I mean I still I'm gonna train them on things but there's a lot of really basic stuff that doesn't require me like personally taking the time to go through and that I want to do those in videos so it's going to be things like setting up your development environment basic you know get commands how to use github just a lot of those things that I use in my workflow and that anybody that wants to work in this department and work on the projects that we're working on will need to know to be able to contribute so those videos will probably be coming soon so assuming that I do have some students so I have some interest there's some students that are interested in learning and coming here doing some work and learning more so hopefully hopefully that will happen and there'll be an added benefit of there being some some tutorial videos on my channel for you all to check out if you like but aside from that there's a lot of great stuff on me or the other the other places that I mentioned are really good and a lot of those places are where I learned okay it looks like at the beginning when I was asking about keeping this form in the cart or not a few of you actually said keep it in the card so I'll keep that in mind well maybe I'll put it in it won't be too hard to put it inside a card so we can always put it back in the card if if we need to suppose where it says hey man shout out from Africa hey thanks for watching Philip asks when you work at home do you have an office or do you have to work where your kids are so actually I I just did kind of a different setup so for the the first few streams that I had done from home I was actually set up like right in my living room uhhuh so it was not really the best place now when I was working my wife had taken the kids somewhere else so it worked out but if the kids had been there it would have been hard to work now I have worked like that before and I just put headphones on and I turned the music up really loud and I've actually been so focused on my work that I've had like the neighbor stopped by came in my house sat down three feet away from me at a table talked to my wife for an hour and then left and I didn't even know she was there so I can focus enough to make that work but I recently moved to my basement in my laundry room and and that's a little bit more private and the kids are less likely to come down there the bad news is it's really noisy when the washer and dryer are running and it's also a basement so there's not really when I was in my living room I could open up I have a lot of windows there I could open up a lot of the windows I'd hear the birds and get a nice breeze blowing through so it felt like I was outside almost so there's a much nicer environment so we'll see how that goes I've always kind of thought about making a legit office but right now I do so much work you know in you know in the office here at the university that it doesn't really make sense for me to have Home Office right now my um is not that big I'm actually running out of space so as you all probably know from previous dreams I have four kids and right now there are two bedrooms for the four kids and which I guess isn't too bad but they're not really big bedrooms so I can't really take one of those and make it my office right now then we'd have one bedroom for all four kids so so we'll see that there have to be some construction involved if I were to have my own home office which isn't out of the question it may it may happen okay Roland says material design specs don't mention this anywhere of it even on Google's properties forms are usually in a card okay that's good to know Patrick doesn't think it'll look like you know okay so if you're not sure what we're talking about right now earlier on we were debating whether or not to have this form in a card like it is here or to put it directly on the page and it seems like so far everyone has said that they wanted in the card and not on the page so we may end up moving it into the card I was worried that it wasn't really you know proper material design style to put this in a card but evidently Google is using it in that way and you know putting forms and cards like that so off to check it out now that I think about it the new settings tab in Chrome I think that's I haven't been there in a long time but I thought they switched materials on yeah they did so the new settings tab in chrome is everything's in cards it's not exactly a forum but it's it's close enough so this is what I'm talking about settings I mean there are form elements within this so yeah that that seems kind of legit like it could it could work so it may end up doing that okay so Kevin says I think it's better in the paper for consistency sake also okay so we do have some some differing opinions here off to think about it Rohan says keep the background off whitish it looks better that way yeah it does do I have to see what the background was I thought I had it off it is off right white right now right it's I guess whatever the default is for material UI is what it is right now which should be slightly off off white I think yeah Sebastian said move the button component to the component folder I will I will move it in there I don't want to just move it right now because I don't have time to make sure that it's it's properly I'll have to change the import to where it's in I think it's only in one view right now actually now it's in two right we just used it again so I want to make sure I have enough time to change those when I move it but I will move it alright Roland says you can use h4 h5 for description just use h1 for the service request form yeah that makes sense maybe I'll go do that I am gonna kind of change this a bit and make it look better and if we end up putting this in a card then we'll have to see what we do about this Jordan asks why the early stream imperative associates a meeting yeah basically I have a meeting at 200 and I was supposed to have another meeting at 300 that ended up getting canceled so I but I figured it'd better just do the early stream that way I know I get it in in case the the other meeting runs long I don't expect it to but I really have no idea how long the other meetings gonna be so I was safer to just stream early let's see if someone in the live stream a Malia how's it going so someone someone who used to work in my department actually just watched on on Instagram so those cool she did web stuff too so that was good she moved on and and now I think she has a better job than all of us in the department so I'm happy for okay so Kevin says there is something in materiai that seat that works for a file picker hasn't tested it yet and I put he put the link in okay awesome off to check that out Oh Sebastian said I can add type file to a text field well that will that work will that look I'll have to check it out later right now yeah I only have another minute left but office it off to check out how that that looks okay Umberto likes the circular riffle so Sebastian okay since the rotate box thing looks choppy yeah I think it looks a little bit better in other implementations that was one of my early implementations of it but yeah it is choppier for sure okay it looks like everybody alright pretty much everybody likes the ripple effect on the checkbook so I think I will end up sticking with that and I think it'll be fun I'm not super upset if I have a slightly different effect on checkboxes for different sites as I go back and update old sites I can always just change it if I need to so I think I'll keep it with the ripple effect Vinicio says Jessie do you think JavaScript would be the best language to begin man I don't I'm not sure if it depends on what you want to do if you know you want to do web development then yeah go with JavaScript because that's that's what you're going to be using if you want to just get more into like programming in general then something else like like Python would be maybe easier to pick up I think you know a lot of places start with Python so yeah I did but it does it just depends on what you want to do so I kind of I started with JavaScript for the most part and it turned out all right for me I guess so it's definitely you know it's doable a lot of people start with JavaScript but I think Python would also be a good alternative if you weren't if you didn't really want to get into web design specifically then maybe Python would be better okay cool so Patrick says the file picker is in the docks under the race button stuff I want to see this unless I'm not seeing it maybe I'm looking in the wrong place there we go all right cool it's just the first one okay cool so you just wrap the input inside the race button all right good to know so this is what we use then and awesome awesome that'll work thank you Patrick for find a desk it's kind of a little weird the place where it I don't I mean I don't know but that just wasn't like obvious to me that I would find the file input under race button oh well it seems like it would make more sense if they had forms as a category and then on the dropdown you had all the different types I think it would make it you clean it up a lot more you think they're taking full requests for their documentation probably they might not care those since they're coming out with a new version for the old version but I think it would be better better organized like that okay cool so in regard to what we're talking about earlier with me trying to get work done with all my kids and no office Philip says I'm right there with you I have three kids and doing side projects is challenging yeah you need CEO says you have four kids that's awesome I have two little girls yeah that's cool isn't it having kids is it's like one of the hardest things I've ever done but it's also one of those awesome things I've ever done and my kids are still little I'm sure it even it gets harder and and more awesome as they get older Ellen says office in a shed or garage says you might have to do something about the network but it might work actually that's that is a good idea my sheds in terrible shape so there's no way I can put any electronic stuff in my shed cuz the roof has holes in it but I really really want to add a girl I don't currently don't have a garage so I really would like a garage and maybe I should keep that in mind if I do end up building a garage to make a space for an office there okay kevin says on the card /page debate there is a paper component that just adds the depth effect okay cool I have to check that out so I won't actually have to like put it in in a card we can just add some depth to the paper Rowan says meetings the nontechnical bane of developers that's for sure I like I just can't take all these meetings there's so many meetings and like some days I feel like I get no coding done because there's too many meetings and you you have to get ready for a meeting and then you have the meeting and then after the meeting you usually have to do something based on what happened in the meeting it's just like and then there's all the emails back and forth trying to find a good time to schedule the meeting for its so it's just crazy all the time spent on meetings I think I mentioned this before in a stream but just in case I haven't I I would love to make like a scheduling app or like maybe a Chrome extension that put automatically on your calendar the price of the meeting so it would just take how many people are in the meeting and then based on like an average salary or something per hour it would tell you how much that meeting is gonna cost and then I think there would be less meetings because people wouldn't just say like okay I'm gonna have like 10 people in this meeting and we're gonna meet for two hours instead they'd say like wow this is a $4,000 meeting maybe we don't need this this $4,000 meeting right now anyway I I think it'd be a good idea I don't and I'm it's not like I made this idea up I'm pretty sure that I saw this somewhere in the internet that someone had done something similar so I don't want to take credit for it but I have no idea where I read it how everyone says meetings discussing previous meetings those are true beauty oh my goodness yeah I hate when I have a meeting about something that we've already decided in previous meetings and we're just trying to remember what we decided in that meeting since like especially when like I remember for sure what happened in that meeting and it's just a matter of trying to convince everybody else that we actually did agree to that thing it's especially frustrating when it's about some some feature on something I'm building Tiffany said that meeting ideas hilarious I know wouldn't that be good right and I feel free any of you to steal that idea and build something with that and if you do then I I will use it but maybe oh I've actually like done it on paper like I've been in a meeting before like calculating how much meetings cost and then I'll usually just like text somebody or write it on a paper and show somebody next to me and we'll we'll smile about it in the heat all right well I made it through all the questions and I think I've gone over the time I said I was gonna gonna go so what else isn't it I'm always doing that so I really do have to go now because I want to get to the meeting and make sure I'm prepared for that so thank you all for for watching especially with the the time change that was kind of late notice so I appreciate y'all being ok with that and joining in and participating especially thank you to everyone who submitted pull requests over the weekend super helpful it's making this project just really awesome and I'll be back tomorrow hopefully at the proper time tomorrow which is 2 p.m. eastern time until then I hope you all have a great day
