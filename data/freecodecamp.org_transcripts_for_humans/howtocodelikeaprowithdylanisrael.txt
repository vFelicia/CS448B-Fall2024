00:00 - hey guys I'm starting a new series
00:01 - called code like a pro and what we're
00:04 - gonna basically teach you is how to code
00:06 - professionally it's pretty apparent when
00:08 - you open up somebody's project and it's
00:10 - a hobby or they're just starting out and
00:13 - they don't know how to improve their
00:16 - code make it so that it looks
00:18 - professional it looks readable
00:20 - maintainable these are all going to be
00:23 - things that I've picked up as my years
00:25 - as a developer but also that I've you
00:28 - know I can't take credit for most of
00:29 - them because like you know I read books
00:30 - and I do courses and I've learned these
00:33 - from people with many more years of
00:35 - experience than I have so what does it
00:38 - mean to have professional code like what
00:41 - I mean by that well I want to give a
00:43 - sort of analogy to explain it a lot of
00:46 - times when you're getting started all
00:48 - you really care about is does your code
00:50 - run and does it deliver the features
00:53 - that you're you know the client wants
00:55 - does it work and it can and I'm assuming
00:59 - it does in both situations where you're
01:01 - writing professional level code and then
01:02 - you're just writing some code where
01:04 - you're gonna you know getting started
01:05 - and learning it's sort of like comparing
01:08 - a tree house to a home it's how I feel
01:10 - like it like there is something that's
01:12 - going to last the test of time because
01:14 - we have written it in such a way that
01:16 - it's going to be maintainable and easily
01:19 - update it and then you have a tree house
01:20 - which is going to slowly get worn down
01:22 - because we didn't build it in the proper
01:24 - way
01:25 - both shelters one's going to outlast the
01:28 - other so what makes clean maintainable
01:31 - code well we're gonna be talking about a
01:34 - whole slew of things in this series and
01:36 - we're actually going to be giving in
01:37 - specific examples not just like hey you
01:39 - should do it this way we are going to
01:41 - tell you how to do this way and why but
01:43 - we're also gonna give coding examples
01:45 - we're gonna say okay when I say variable
01:47 - names need to be descriptive and how
01:50 - what does that mean exactly and how can
01:52 - we showcase that our code will be now
01:54 - more readable by using something like
01:56 - you know object or ad structuring for
01:59 - instance to get us going here and see
02:02 - actually see in our in real time how we
02:05 - can take this set of code and now we
02:07 - make it this set of code and it makes a
02:09 - whole lot more sense so we're gonna talk
02:12 - about code readability
02:13 - you don't write code for yourself or the
02:16 - client even well I mean you do because
02:19 - they're cutting the checks right so but
02:21 - the reason the not the reason but one of
02:24 - the reasons that you write code is you
02:26 - write it for the next person has to
02:27 - maintain it right the average dev is a
02:29 - job two years or something like that and
02:31 - chances are that projects gonna outlive
02:33 - you for a very long time and so you need
02:36 - to make sure that you're writing the
02:37 - cleanest code possible the most
02:39 - maintainable code and to do that you
02:42 - have to write readable code so what is
02:45 - the link team to those of us who are new
02:47 - the concept well linting really is two
02:51 - things and these are always I whenever
02:53 - you're incorporating a tool you have to
02:55 - answer what I call the big two the what
02:57 - and the why so what is a linter it is a
03:01 - tool that you set up essentially one
03:04 - time usually per project that will flag
03:06 - airs programming errors bugs stylistic
03:09 - errors and suspicious constructs was I
03:12 - mean it's basically gonna catch syntax
03:14 - errors that's it it's going to find out
03:17 - if you're making simple mistakes in your
03:19 - code we're hey you're declaring this
03:21 - here outside of its scope and that's
03:24 - gonna break Java Script is one of those
03:26 - languages where sometimes we don't find
03:27 - if that happens until we work our way
03:29 - through the application so linters give
03:32 - us the opportunity to find those airs
03:34 - earlier and more often it also adds a
03:37 - readability what that means is we're
03:38 - gonna make sure that we our code is
03:41 - formatted in such a way that is the
03:43 - industry standard or is a standard for
03:46 - that language that programming items and
03:49 - that's the why so it's gonna catch
03:51 - errors syntax there sometimes for more
03:53 - than syntax errors it's gonna have
03:55 - trouble catching logic errors but yeah
03:56 - but that's that's usually more so a
04:00 - developer issue and we'll talk about how
04:02 - to catch those later on this something
04:05 - that can also be automated so you don't
04:07 - have to run it every time it's just
04:09 - there and we'll start picking up good
04:11 - habits by just sort of being trained by
04:13 - the linter to a degree and this will
04:15 - lead to more readable code less prone
04:18 - less bug buggy code and we'll be writing
04:22 - in better standards because of it so
04:24 - let's go ahead and jump into an exam
04:27 - all right so what we have here is a
04:29 - typed script file which is just
04:30 - JavaScript it's a superset of JavaScript
04:33 - and what we're gonna be looking at is
04:35 - you know immediately because he didn't
04:38 - intend this file to retire if we have
04:39 - some error so I'm not too worried about
04:41 - that right now
04:42 - we should have some worries but you'll
04:45 - see here this is before we turn the
04:47 - linter on by the way and so what's gonna
04:50 - happen here is we're gonna go ahead and
04:51 - turn the linter on and see hey let's
04:54 - take this file from someone just getting
04:57 - started and see how we could just clean
04:58 - up our code to follow the standards and
05:00 - don't worry about the setup of linters I
05:03 - will include as I mentioned two videos
05:04 - but I'm gonna go ahead and turn the
05:06 - linter back on and reload the app and
05:09 - what we're gonna see here is quite a bit
05:12 - of difference supposed to be oh there
05:16 - goes just a little bit of a hiccup so
05:17 - you can see that now there's something
05:20 - wrong with pretty much everything in
05:22 - this file and this is so where linters
05:27 - excel at is catching those small errors
05:29 - that are cement semantics in nature or
05:33 - that are you know we want to anything
05:37 - that we can compare that they're not
05:39 - logic based errors there our structure
05:41 - heirs they are formatting heirs items
05:44 - like that and so what you'll see here is
05:46 - that the standard for comments for
05:49 - instance this have a space between them
05:51 - and so that's something we can fix
05:53 - you'll see here that and in modern
05:55 - JavaScript you know the VAR keyword is
05:57 - essentially forbidden and that's what
05:59 - the word they use and it'll say okay
06:01 - this is something that we have decided
06:03 - that you know use letter constant so for
06:06 - the time being we'll go ahead and change
06:07 - all the VARs here and there's quite a
06:10 - bit right there's quite a bit to let so
06:15 - we'll change that to let go ahead and
06:16 - replace all of those far so we may have
06:18 - to change some of them the cons you'll
06:20 - also see that when we hover over this
06:22 - the CS lint is saying hey on average you
06:24 - can use you should be using double
06:26 - quotes that's in quotes that's kind of a
06:28 - silly one but you can change that
06:31 - depending on your preference but I think
06:33 - the the more important point here is
06:34 - that you see double quotes here singing
06:37 - quotes here is we want to have a set
06:40 - and 'red of what it is we're doing you
06:42 - shouldn't have multiple ways of how you
06:43 - do things like this in your code so
06:46 - let's go ahead and replace all the
06:48 - single quotes with double quotes but you
06:51 - can see how we're slowly going to make
06:53 - this file just look a little bit cleaner
06:56 - this isn't something necessarily the
06:58 - winter would do but from a personal
07:00 - standpoint I would say that that you
07:04 - know you want your codes spaced out
07:05 - evenly as well when we're getting
07:07 - started here your code needs to look
07:10 - like you cared that's really what code
07:12 - readability means as we're going through
07:14 - here so we'll go ahead and put a space
07:16 - here put a space here and there's gonna
07:18 - be other things that we're gonna want to
07:19 - do this file as we progress but we just
07:21 - want to make it a little bit more
07:23 - readable and we can do this in just a
07:25 - few more steps anytime you'd have
07:29 - commented code in here as well you can
07:31 - go ahead and remove that there's no
07:32 - reason to have that anyhow so right now
07:35 - you're going through the file we're
07:36 - doing these minor changes a lot of this
07:39 - will be syntax stuff so if it's
07:40 - important right we're using a let
07:42 - instead of a Const and there's there's
07:44 - hundreds of rules when it comes to this
07:45 - and so what you'll end up picking up are
07:47 - these good conventions these conventions
07:49 - that say hey what makes a good what
07:52 - makes a eight well what makes good clean
07:55 - code because that's really what a linter
07:57 - is therefore for what it can do in that
08:00 - aspect and you'll pick these up just
08:03 - your habit if you're having yam so what
08:06 - we've done is now we have made our code
08:09 - just using the linter and there's still
08:11 - some errors in here and that's we'll
08:13 - talk about those in a later section but
08:15 - we have been able to make our code much
08:16 - more readable much more understandable
08:19 - and to the latest standards and in terms
08:23 - of just basic TS lint things and linters
08:26 - to get going so laters are here to stop
08:30 - those syntax mistakes lint trees are
08:33 - here to get you the code in a certain
08:35 - manner in a cleaner manner in a more
08:38 - readable manner and they are the first
08:40 - step to writing cleaner more
08:43 - maintainable code this will be the more
08:45 - of the hard code like this is the only
08:46 - tool the rest of the stuff we're gonna
08:48 - be talking about this is stuff that you
08:49 - have to learn that you have to implement
08:51 - and one thing about linters and in our
08:54 - case we're just using TS lint but one
08:57 - thing is that you have the ability
08:59 - override rules because they're not
09:00 - absolutes right we don't live in a world
09:02 - of absolutes but these always help to
09:04 - get you going these always help to get
09:06 - you started especially when you're just
09:08 - getting started to writing cleaner code
09:09 - and in especially in a JavaScript
09:12 - environment where this is kind of a
09:13 - newer idea when you're getting it going
09:16 - and knowing maybe I've told you about it
09:17 - which is kind of occurred to me like
09:19 - this is where we should start today
09:21 - we're going to be talking about how we
09:22 - can define our variables and use them
09:25 - better to accomplish a couple objectives
09:28 - right we all want to be able to write
09:30 - software like a professional and these
09:32 - are some of the items that you need to
09:34 - keep in mind when you're using variables
09:35 - as well as defining names for variables
09:38 - so what is that going to accomplish
09:40 - we're gonna have three objectives by the
09:42 - end of this course you're gonna write
09:43 - code that is more searchable readable
09:46 - and understandable there's a lot of uh
09:47 - bolts there but this is what our
09:50 - objective is here and we're gonna talk a
09:53 - little bit about what those what how
09:55 - we're gonna accomplish those objectives
09:56 - now these are just some of them but
09:58 - we're gonna be diving into other things
09:59 - as well we're talking about following
10:00 - language standards limiting scope of
10:03 - variables we're talking about creating
10:04 - new variables versus reusing them
10:06 - eliminating magic numbers and magic
10:09 - strings and items like that in general
10:11 - we're gonna talk about naming varial in
10:13 - a good portion of time talking about
10:15 - that about choosing a name that
10:17 - describes what a variable does or what
10:19 - its purpose is not how it does it and
10:21 - then we're going to talk about what I
10:22 - called the this relates to name and the
10:25 - variable is what I call the parent or
10:26 - significant other test well dive into
10:28 - that in the code examples and we're also
10:30 - gonna talk about when we can use long
10:32 - names for variables and when verse short
10:34 - names and you know some of the you know
10:38 - how we can incorporate that into our
10:40 - code and more some of the and more
10:42 - sections we're going to talk about is
10:43 - the practices that a lot of people do
10:45 - that we need to break right you're
10:47 - actually causing more harm than good and
10:49 - those are some of the examples we're
10:51 - gonna give so I'm not one that really
10:53 - like looking at at slides I learn from
10:55 - the code let's go ahead and dive in
10:57 - alright so let's start with a couple
10:59 - different things here here we have a
11:00 - simple algorithm to return a factorial
11:04 - of a number it's not important about the
11:08 - code it's not important that's in
11:09 - JavaScript but the important point here
11:11 - is there's a couple things that we can
11:14 - fix immediately with our variables one
11:18 - we can start following the language
11:21 - standards right this is something that's
11:23 - very simple and immediately going to be
11:25 - apparent in JavaScript for instance you
11:28 - would never ever have something and I'll
11:30 - captain unless you're dealing with a
11:31 - constant and an actual constant meaning
11:34 - it's not an object or an array that
11:36 - you're going to be modifying but this is
11:38 - something that we need to keep in mind
11:40 - at the very least because before we can
11:43 - get get into the higher-level things of
11:45 - hey we need to be able to to understand
11:49 - how to write good variable names this
11:51 - week we have to just understand how to
11:52 - write variable so we have to write this
11:53 - to our standards so we're gonna use our
11:56 - camel case lower case camel case which
11:59 - is the standard here and go ahead and
12:01 - fix this alright the next thing that we
12:04 - need to start thinking about is can we
12:06 - eliminate variables the less variables
12:08 - the better and this is actually some
12:11 - code I wrote from like three years ago
12:12 - so you know don't think that you know
12:15 - everyone writes bad code and we all
12:17 - improve as well as long as we put effort
12:19 - into but can we eliminate things this is
12:21 - something that we need to start thinking
12:22 - about because it's rather important and
12:24 - the less variables we have to maintain
12:26 - the better so in our example here we can
12:29 - actually eliminate this count variable
12:30 - altogether there's really no reason to
12:32 - have it and you know you'll see here
12:35 - okay what are we doing with it we're
12:37 - saying it zero okay can we eliminate it
12:39 - well yeah because number here which is
12:42 - just a number and this is typescript
12:43 - right and we're expected to return the
12:45 - number here just provide some context
12:46 - but count isn't counts doing nothing
12:51 - count is doing absolutely nothing for
12:53 - what we need to do it here is it
12:54 - performing anything different than
12:56 - number no then what we can do is we can
12:59 - just eliminate it there's no shame in
13:02 - eliminating variables when needed you
13:04 - know this is just clutter at the end of
13:05 - the day you should if you can't have as
13:07 - few variables as possible because then
13:11 - there's less moving parts there's less
13:12 - things that we have to keep track of now
13:16 - you start we start looking here where we
13:18 - have another no no at the end of the day
13:20 - this this is debatable but in my opinion
13:24 - we need to numb is not a descriptive
13:27 - enough word and we probably shouldn't be
13:30 - reassigning the values either as we are
13:33 - going through here as you can see right
13:36 - so we're modifying them which is now
13:37 - going to break this for loop but let's
13:40 - go ahead and create a variable that
13:41 - actually has a good name now when we
13:44 - create a variable we want to describe
13:46 - what it does or what it is and not how
13:49 - it does it a lot of times when people
13:51 - start getting descriptive you know I let
13:54 - me give you a very bad example of a
13:57 - variable name in this instance let
14:02 - factorial let total multiplications and
14:08 - we'll you know initialize it to numb all
14:15 - right total multiplications is
14:17 - technically true for a variable name but
14:21 - it isn't what we need to do here and
14:23 - it's not what we we should want to do
14:24 - either yeah
14:26 - so total multiplications is not a good
14:29 - name and a better name is factorial
14:33 - factorial total now what is this well it
14:38 - is the number that we are storing our
14:41 - factorials in our total factorial all
14:44 - right now let's go ahead and set up here
14:48 - and we can do it just like so and now
14:51 - here we'll return our factorial total
14:53 - and not some random numbnuts coming in
14:55 - let's give another example of some bad
14:58 - variable names all right let's take a
15:00 - look at this function all this functions
15:02 - supposed to do is return today's date
15:03 - now you'll see here we have this D and
15:05 - this is a very simple function but we
15:07 - have this D here and we're creating it
15:10 - now if we didn't know what this was and
15:11 - we didn't know what this was would we
15:13 - know what D is if we had a conversation
15:15 - so earlier I rec I talked about the
15:18 - parent our significant other test so if
15:20 - I said to you baby what do you think
15:23 - variable D is what would you say
15:28 - okay okay oh well what would you say if
15:32 - we renamed it to I said hey what do you
15:34 - think today's date as a variable would
15:37 - would be excellent that is the
15:41 - significant other or apparent test you
15:44 - should be able to Hansel won a piece of
15:46 - paper and this is the title really at
15:48 - the end of the day and it should be that
15:49 - readable when you get going
15:51 - let's go ahead and give some other
15:53 - examples let's give a few more examples
15:55 - of how we might refactor our code in a
15:57 - relatively clean project where we want
16:00 - to make it more readable and more
16:02 - understandable when it comes to our
16:04 - variable names here we have an algorithm
16:06 - that is going to take in some values a
16:09 - double nested array for when we last
16:13 - backed up some items that's all we need
16:15 - to know about it now the first thing
16:18 - that we can do is what we're going to be
16:20 - returning back is a are the file IDs
16:23 - that we want to update but you might be
16:27 - thinking hey we're just returning file
16:28 - elegies another way that we could up
16:30 - that make it a little bit better is it's
16:32 - actually technically we only want the
16:34 - ones to update so go ahead and make that
16:37 - more descriptive is now making this this
16:39 - function more descriptive in the process
16:41 - and you have an idea of what it is
16:42 - you're trying to accomplish it's going
16:45 - to update this like so all right next
16:49 - one thing I want I've talked about in
16:51 - the intro was that there are times to
16:53 - use short variable names and there are
16:55 - times you use long variable names now in
16:59 - here when your scope is very short
17:02 - meaning it's like a callback function
17:03 - it's returning something it is alright
17:07 - to be using short names such as here so
17:11 - we're having file IDs all we're doing is
17:13 - sorting it is I personally will still do
17:15 - file ID but this is an understandable
17:18 - situation especially in typescript where
17:19 - we might do we might drop that F put ID
17:21 - and then maybe we add a type of file
17:24 - onto here right and then it's it's just
17:26 - as descriptive as before but now we can
17:30 - eliminate a little bit of clutter but in
17:32 - terms of short scope of our variables
17:37 - like so this is completely fine if we
17:40 - wanted to shorten those
17:41 - a little bit but one thing I would
17:44 - highly suggest is that you start using
17:46 - tools that are built into the language
17:48 - where if you are going to iterate
17:50 - through an entire array for instance
17:52 - there's no reason to do a for loop like
17:54 - this we're iterating through the entire
17:56 - array and we have tools to make this
17:58 - more descriptive while still iterating
18:01 - through it so let's use a four of loop
18:03 - for instance and I'll talk about how
18:05 - we're gonna make it more descriptive so
18:06 - in our for of loop we're gonna remove
18:09 - some variables we're gonna remove all
18:11 - these ugly eyes and instead we're gonna
18:13 - replace changes eye with a more
18:15 - descriptive word that allows us to write
18:17 - cleaner more readable searchable and
18:20 - maintainable code so how can we do this
18:22 - well what which what we're gonna have is
18:24 - a change of changes and we could maybe
18:30 - let's let's just refactor it's one piece
18:33 - at a time so here we're not eliminating
18:35 - pieces of pieces of text here
18:38 - piece by piece by piece and it's a
18:40 - little bit cleaner now what are we
18:43 - iterating through well we're clearly
18:45 - iterating through our array of changes
18:47 - which is an excellent name and when you
18:49 - were talking about renaming variables
18:51 - make sure that you take into
18:53 - consideration renaming functions and
18:55 - renaming parameters because they are
18:56 - equally as important when you're moving
18:59 - forward and we'll have a whole section
19:00 - on functions and parameters as well but
19:04 - that's nice neither here nor another
19:05 - there but you'll notice that we have
19:07 - this change 0 and change 1 and change
19:10 - one and you know if you're super into
19:12 - familiar with the changes array it may
19:15 - make sense but we want to look at our
19:17 - code and not have to dive deeper we want
19:20 - to have the simplest ways that we can do
19:21 - that and we can use things in JavaScript
19:24 - and other languages as well where we can
19:26 - give a more descriptive descriptive
19:31 - descriptive descriptive variable name
19:33 - and assignments here while making our
19:35 - code so what is change 0 change 0 is
19:38 - greater than last backup time doesn't
19:39 - make anything but if we go ahead and
19:41 - create a Const air and we say hey let's
19:44 - do some will say Kant's is equal to what
19:49 - we want to change we'll create a
19:52 - variable here so each one these changes
19:55 - are
19:55 - ray will do a little bit of array
19:57 - deconstruction and we'll say last
20:02 - updated time and we'll go ahead and also
20:06 - create a variable here called file ID or
20:11 - updated file ID and we'll just set this
20:17 - equal to change and we have those
20:21 - variables now that we have this we can
20:23 - make our code here so much more readable
20:26 - we're saying hey is our code was our
20:31 - last updated time greater than the last
20:33 - backup time that makes more sense than
20:36 - change to zero right and was our updated
20:38 - file ID do we already have does our file
20:44 - IDs to update already include the
20:46 - updated file ID if it doesn't go ahead
20:50 - and add two file IDs to update our
20:52 - current file ID now with just a couple
20:55 - changes in our logic here not not
20:58 - changes in our logic changes in our
21:00 - structure we have eliminated some of the
21:03 - floating sort enough floating but index
21:06 - values that aren't needed and we have
21:08 - instead done a little bit of array
21:11 - deconstructing to pass in values and now
21:14 - this reads very very clear at least in
21:17 - when it talks about our variable define
21:21 - menemen so it's a weird where do you say
21:24 - one thing i wanted to say is don't be
21:27 - afraid to change variable names as well
21:29 - so the thing you have to remember when
21:31 - you're writing code is that it's always
21:33 - changed your I new features are coming
21:35 - out updates are coming out and even just
21:36 - sitting here I was thinking about this
21:38 - variable name a little bit and I was
21:40 - gonna move on to the next section by
21:42 - sinking this isn't even completely
21:43 - correct it's not that file IDs we want
21:46 - to update we want to backup files that's
21:50 - what we're trying to get here now we are
21:52 - storing file IDs in there but what is
21:55 - what is it we're trying to accomplish we
21:57 - are trying to backup files and so file
22:02 - IDs to backup we're not trying to update
22:04 - anything and so these are the IDS to
22:07 - back it up
22:08 - so don't be
22:09 - to jump in and change this and if you
22:11 - dive into the code and the variable
22:13 - names are bad or the variable names have
22:16 - slightly changed don't be afraid to go
22:18 - and change it a lot of times people are
22:19 - especially if it's code they didn't
22:20 - originally write one thing that people
22:23 - do all the time especially when they're
22:24 - getting started with object-oriented
22:26 - oriented programming is they start
22:28 - prefixing property names with the name
22:31 - of the class and it's a really bad item
22:33 - what I mean by that is say we have this
22:35 - cat class and it is our friend's cat
22:37 - that's whose cat it is and we want to
22:40 - update our friends cats age so we've
22:43 - just had a birthday you would have the
22:45 - properties right now which essentially
22:47 - are variables at the end of day of an
22:49 - object say hey cat age is now 10 and
22:53 - then our friend's cat dot name we're
22:59 - updating his name to be Tito we do not
23:04 - need to prefix property names in our
23:07 - classes so we could go ahead and just
23:08 - remove that like so this is something
23:11 - that people do all the time all the time
23:13 - all the time and I've been guilty of
23:17 - this as well so don't think most of
23:19 - things that I'm telling you are things
23:20 - that I've done and learned from there's
23:23 - no reason to preface preface prefix
23:26 - these items you know we have
23:28 - intellisense we can hover over we can
23:30 - see the type we can look through the
23:31 - code all it does is create clutter and
23:34 - confusion so when you're dealing with
23:36 - objects you don't want to be doing that
23:38 - another thing to keep in mind is when
23:40 - you have constants when you have
23:43 - variables older developers although it's
23:47 - not too common nowadays well use what's
23:50 - called Hungarian notation or essentially
23:52 - you're going to include the type in your
23:55 - item so let's say we have a type here
23:57 - and I remember our file IDs so we do 5
24:01 - IDs and then you would include number at
24:05 - the end or at the beginning depending on
24:07 - the convention but this is essentially
24:08 - Hungarian notation now this is a very
24:11 - bad practice and something I encourage
24:14 - you not to do for one if you're using
24:16 - typescript you don't need to and most
24:17 - programming languages that aren't that
24:19 - is not JavaScript will have a type that
24:21 - you can assign to it
24:22 - - what else could file IDs be it could
24:26 - be a string I guess I could be a number
24:28 - but this adds clutter and unnecessary is
24:33 - actually a dynamic type and so we get a
24:35 - number of string sometimes a string
24:37 - number what do we do all we're doing is
24:41 - adding confusion to our code so avoid
24:43 - Hungarian notation as much as possible
24:45 - all right one thing that you need to
24:47 - avoid as well are what we call magic
24:50 - numbers and strings for that matter when
24:53 - when it when you are but that's a little
24:56 - bit different magic strings refers to
24:57 - passing in a key into an object that you
25:02 - haven't defined you typically want to
25:04 - avoid that but here magic numbers refers
25:06 - to passing in numbers that apparently
25:10 - came out of nowhere with no context
25:12 - right so here you'll see 63,000 667 and
25:16 - point four four four seven do you know
25:18 - what this is I I do just because I had
25:22 - recently looked at it but it took me a
25:24 - second to figure it out
25:25 - this is actually the earth radius to
25:27 - figure out the orbital period so let's
25:29 - go ahead and provide contacts and
25:31 - context and we'll make this a a big old
25:36 - constant in this case and all caps and
25:39 - we're gonna set it equal to this value
25:43 - now we have a much better idea what this
25:47 - is
25:47 - and when go ahead and pass in earth
25:49 - radius actually I don't really like that
25:52 - now we're gonna do it like this if I was
25:56 - doing a global constant I might have
25:58 - liked that but either way so we have
26:00 - earth radius here and then what is this
26:02 - big ol number well it's going to be the
26:06 - gravitational metric we'll do grab
26:10 - metric and set it equal to this and
26:16 - insert crap metric here now our code is
26:18 - much more readable we do have more
26:20 - variable so that's alright but it's more
26:22 - readable which is the objective here so
26:26 - avoid magic numbers win at all possible
26:29 - another thing to keep in mind when
26:32 - working with variables is you want to
26:33 - limit the scope to be as
26:36 - small as possible and what I mean by
26:38 - that is you know here we have this
26:40 - beginner project that we've will be
26:42 - refactoring or we did a refactor and
26:44 - upcoming linter video but we we have a
26:50 - ton of of global variables typically you
26:54 - want to avoid global variables if at all
26:56 - possible and when you can such as like
26:59 - this answer buttons used in two spot
27:01 - it's used in this function here
27:03 - same thing with only used in this
27:07 - function the same thing I would imagine
27:08 - with this one and what's with this one
27:11 - so what we can do is we can go ahead and
27:14 - take this jump down to here and put it
27:18 - into our where it belongs which is in a
27:21 - more local scope to where it's at the
27:25 - idea here with your variables is you
27:27 - want to keep them as close to where they
27:30 - need to exist because it's going to
27:34 - provide the most context for how much
27:36 - they are useful right so you typically
27:39 - want to avoid the global scope if you
27:40 - can and put variables in the most
27:42 - limited scope possible so that you can
27:45 - get that additional context another
27:48 - variable naming to consider is when
27:51 - working working with boolean
27:53 - specifically there is a is for present
27:56 - tense or has for past tense in terms of
28:00 - the naming convention this sort of lets
28:01 - you flag it out here and we can you know
28:04 - typically we don't ever want to put the
28:06 - variable types in here if we can avoid
28:08 - it so we can do something like this
28:10 - where instead of is box boolean with is
28:14 - box meaning it is a box or it is not a
28:16 - box or if you prefer that past tense has
28:19 - box or does not have box in that sense
28:22 - the only thing I will say that when you
28:24 - are naming this keep it singular because
28:26 - part of our objective here is to make
28:30 - items readable and pronounceable so his
28:34 - box would be how I would go about it
28:36 - typically for me in the present tense so
28:38 - we can go ahead and replace box boolean
28:40 - with a box everywhere and clean that up
28:43 - a little bit so that's something to keep
28:44 - in mind when you're working with naming
28:47 - for boolean variables
28:49 - now this is a little bit of a personal
28:51 - preference I would say but one thing for
28:54 - variables is default parameters a lot of
28:57 - times you'll see people use this or you
29:00 - know if we have a invalid value here a
29:03 - falsie value but I would I would argue
29:07 - that if you need a default value for
29:09 - your parameters they should be which
29:11 - essentially are variables at the end of
29:13 - the day right we're passing data
29:14 - anything it passes data we're
29:15 - considering very well at this point but
29:17 - we instead want to have this value here
29:20 - the reason for it is now the reason for
29:24 - it is it's its default value thus you
29:27 - can assign the only the only caveat to
29:29 - that is that it does it work slightly
29:32 - different than our or operator so this
29:35 - will only assign a default value if it
29:38 - is actually undefined while here it will
29:42 - do it for any false a value so keep that
29:45 - in mind but in general you want to
29:47 - unless you have a good reason want to
29:50 - put it in your default parameters
29:51 - because it's in one location
29:54 - one one place to look at and it's it's
29:57 - in my in my opinion a little bit cleaner
30:00 - than using the or operator
30:05 - we're talking about functions our
30:06 - objectives for functions are gonna be
30:08 - pretty similar to what our objectives
30:10 - for or for variables we want to have
30:13 - readable searchable and understandable
30:16 - code which will lead to more
30:17 - maintainable code we could go ahead and
30:19 - put that in there as well if we want to
30:21 - but three bubbles seems like enough so
30:23 - are some of the ways that we're gonna
30:25 - consciousness us where it's gonna differ
30:26 - slightly we're gonna write smaller
30:30 - functions and we're gonna say showcase
30:32 - how we might do that and why and when
30:34 - might we might do that and we are gonna
30:37 - also go ahead and hide me for a second
30:41 - [Music]
30:45 - movemove there we go we're gonna move
30:51 - Dylan over here and what we're gonna do
30:55 - is we're going to eliminate boolean
30:57 - flags we're going to talk a little bit
30:59 - of all these things we're talking about
31:00 - why I just want to tell you why to do
31:02 - things this is the right way do it my
31:04 - way it's not not always my way but do it
31:06 - but can't tell you why that's important
31:10 - so uh we're going to talk about writing
31:13 - our functions so they read top to bottom
31:15 - making sure that's the correct way we're
31:17 - going to talk about correct function
31:18 - naming how do we know we're naming
31:20 - functions I work over about three four
31:22 - things that we can do to name our
31:24 - functions properly and give some
31:25 - examples we're gonna talk about limiting
31:28 - parameters and how we might go about
31:29 - doing that and why we need to do that
31:32 - we're gonna of course talk about the DRI
31:34 - principle which hopefully everyone's
31:35 - familiar with don't repeat yourself and
31:38 - why that's so important we're gonna talk
31:40 - about avoiding side-effects in our code
31:42 - to the best our ability and we're going
31:45 - to be talking about why there should
31:47 - never be global functions these are some
31:49 - of the topics we're gonna hit on let's
31:51 - go ahead and dive into some of the
31:52 - examples this file might look somewhat
31:54 - familiar we're going to continue to
31:56 - refactor it so we've talked about one
31:59 - concept per or at least I think we have
32:01 - one concept per action item right so if
32:06 - you were going to get some data you
32:09 - might preface that with the verb get you
32:12 - know you're not gonna start using
32:14 - interchangeable words like retrieve and
32:17 - and uplifter i don't know why you wanna
32:19 - say upload typically you'd say get and
32:21 - that's the idea here and that goes the
32:22 - same for like if you're going to use the
32:24 - word update for updating something that
32:26 - would be what you would do you wouldn't
32:29 - say set you want to say update you you
32:31 - choose a verb to stick with because you
32:33 - want your code to be readable and part
32:36 - of that process is renaming the very by
32:38 - renaming the function names as well as
32:40 - in the process
32:42 - eliminating comments now I in future
32:46 - section we're going to talk about
32:47 - comments but right now we're not going
32:49 - to worry too much about it because it's
32:51 - more about functions but they kind of
32:52 - are interchangeable at times so we have
32:55 - random number here for the most part
32:58 - this is a this is a decent decent
33:04 - variable name some things that we could
33:06 - change about it is variable names are
33:08 - supposed to be verbs there are actions
33:11 - that are happening so how do we change
33:13 - this to verb well we add get we have
33:15 - getting on here is more descriptive of
33:18 - what it actually is
33:22 - you'll see here we have a min and a max
33:24 - I don't we could maybe change random
33:26 - number here to be get random number from
33:28 - range if we really wanted to be specific
33:30 - I think that's fine because I that
33:33 - that's that's as descriptive as we can
33:36 - probably get and you know this is
33:38 - typescript in JavaScript typically you
33:41 - don't have return types this is a
33:43 - personal preference I will say what I
33:45 - think makes more maintainable code is
33:47 - when we actually put explicit return
33:50 - types typescript is optional and in
33:53 - JavaScript it doesn't exist but in most
33:55 - languages you have the ability to add an
33:57 - explicit return type as well as
34:00 - explicitly saying what these values will
34:03 - be which I think are is equally
34:06 - important you know I think let's just go
34:09 - through this this project from the top
34:11 - to bottom and see if there's a way that
34:13 - we can update these functions just to
34:14 - make the function names a little bit
34:16 - more readable a little bit more
34:18 - understandable let's see here so this is
34:21 - our box-sizing prop add CSS to selected
34:24 - buttons and changes answers in box
34:26 - sizing so realistically I think this
34:28 - should probably be broken out into
34:30 - different app different different
34:34 - functions whenever I see an if/else like
34:37 - this I started thinking about how can I
34:39 - eliminate it not because if an else
34:40 - statements are inherently bad or
34:43 - anything like that but usually it's
34:48 - because they really are doing two
34:49 - separate things and I want to treat it
34:51 - that way so in in this instance I would
34:53 - define a Bock a function update see
35:00 - we're gonna update is Fox
35:02 - so select changes answers in box there's
35:04 - a update order box-sizing something like
35:10 - that and in here let's start it looks
35:16 - like we're not actually returning
35:17 - anything which is why it's an update but
35:19 - we know how to put a void return type
35:21 - and instead let's start by here passing
35:25 - this in here that should all still be
35:27 - the same and then in here and I think
35:30 - we'll do a little bit more updating in a
35:32 - second as well this dot update order
35:34 - box-sizing else this is going to be
35:39 - content blocks function update content
35:44 - box sizing it looks like we're not going
35:48 - to be taking anything in else in here
35:50 - try to put a void on that and we're
35:52 - gonna go ahead and paste this in here
35:56 - like so and go ahead and do this update
36:02 - content books I think I'm sorry we don't
36:06 - need to this on here because we're not
36:08 - working within a class it's just a
36:09 - generic type search application so we've
36:14 - now put all the logic in two separate
36:16 - files and if and we're saying at the end
36:19 - of here reset so we have this double
36:23 - order box and our else and we've sort of
36:27 - put these in two smaller functions
36:30 - that's really one of the things if your
36:32 - functions more than ten lines long you
36:34 - need to start reconsidering
36:35 - reconsidering how we might be able to
36:39 - how we might be able to go about and
36:42 - refactor the
36:44 - and you know that that includes renaming
36:47 - these to provide additional context like
36:49 - we could probably have guessed based off
36:52 - the content that was in here that hey if
36:54 - border box is true update border box
36:56 - sizing but and then reading through here
36:59 - to see oh well we're updating content
37:01 - box right and that's how we did it to
37:04 - name this but a better way of doing that
37:06 - is to write cleaner more maintainable
37:08 - code as we can and then that that way
37:11 - also we can test these functions
37:13 - individually as well we'll say hey
37:15 - update content box sizing that makes
37:17 - sense an update border box-sizing it's a
37:19 - more descriptive variable name and it's
37:21 - easier to read here as well and and what
37:24 - happens on top of that I guess is that
37:27 - once you you know if any of the codes
37:28 - breaking you're obviously gonna look at
37:30 - these functions but when you're looking
37:31 - at this sort of container this public
37:32 - function public function mean meaning
37:35 - the users going to be dealing with it
37:37 - while these would probably be private
37:38 - functions meaning that the user doesn't
37:40 - even know they exist they just see that
37:42 - there's something that says update
37:43 - border box sizing update content box
37:45 - saucing they can't actually call these
37:46 - directly then we have a month we really
37:49 - only have to maintain one function and
37:52 - be able to read one function to see what
37:54 - it does in the in the meantime unless
37:57 - something breaks or isn't working
37:58 - properly okay so this would be a a great
38:02 - example of how we might might modify a
38:07 - name here this so we have this add
38:09 - points where we're incrementing points
38:12 - and you can make the argument that
38:15 - perhaps what we're actually doing here
38:16 - is updating the points add is a little
38:19 - bit more descriptive but update update
38:24 - points by one by by I so this is a
38:31 - unique one because it looks like we're
38:33 - always incrementing so you might
38:34 - actually be able to say that hey when
38:36 - we're always incrementing add is a good
38:38 - name so I take it back I think this is a
38:40 - good value here and then we are calling
38:44 - great job after the fact now this is
38:46 - more of a form anything and we'll do a
38:47 - formatting video but typically you want
38:49 - and we'll leave it but typically you're
38:51 - gonna want to say your a lot you want
38:53 - two separate blocks of code baseball
38:55 - spaces
38:58 - let's see here uh so this is probably a
39:01 - a name that we would refactor very
39:04 - quickly and the reason for it it's great
39:05 - job is that descriptive right it doesn't
39:07 - really provide any context it is it is
39:13 - sort of a funny name in the fact that
39:15 - like oh great job what is what is this
39:18 - actually probably a completion and
39:23 - animation this would be something like
39:28 - trigger completion something like that
39:33 - like you have animation probably on top
39:37 - of there here we are saying like hey you
39:41 - completed it it's an animation in this
39:43 - trigger set right so this is much more
39:45 - descriptive than great job let's see if
39:47 - we have any more great jobs out there
39:51 - nope just the one in here alright so
39:57 - cool so we're triggering our completion
39:59 - animation and I may have this slightly
40:02 - wrong but triggering animation is right
40:06 - there may be a trigger add points
40:10 - animation that might even be something
40:12 - that makes sense we're now adding points
40:14 - I'm making the assumption that hey this
40:18 - is this is something that is uh this is
40:22 - something that is after they they're
40:24 - completed the the example let's see here
40:28 - set styles so I definitely would change
40:30 - this to update styles because we are
40:33 - trying to do one concept one verb per
40:36 - concept right and you also notice that a
40:39 - good job was not a verb as well
40:42 - functions and methods these are verbs
40:45 - and we need to treat them as such right
40:48 - so I'm not really take so here we're
40:53 - gonna do update CSS display again
40:56 - because we are updating a ton of
40:59 - different values here
41:05 - yeah we'll leave it at that I think so
41:09 - answer buttons a whole lot going on in
41:12 - this thing let me take a quicker look
41:13 - crow quick there's another great example
41:16 - of how we're going to set different
41:20 - values here there's a lot going on in
41:23 - this function here and to be honest I'm
41:28 - not fully sure everything that's going
41:30 - on here we're gonna delete this line of
41:31 - code because I don't do dick all right
41:37 - so it sounds like this is updating the
41:39 - answer buttons so we're gonna update
41:42 - answer and I mean you could to preview
41:46 - TN but there's really no reason to don't
41:49 - be afraid to have a long variable names
41:50 - long variable names are descriptive
41:52 - variable names typically we have three
41:55 - things here you know we all use
41:58 - intellisense
41:59 - it doesn't matter that we're using extra
42:01 - extra buttons these are all all the
42:04 - great things so uh how would we so I
42:09 - think what we're gonna do here is we're
42:11 - going to this incorrect won't ever use
42:16 - it incredible and correct one and
42:19 - correct so CSS is that here is a global
42:24 - election so I'm going to and notice by
42:26 - the way how when I'm writing these
42:27 - additional functions that we're gonna
42:29 - break out our code it's always right
42:30 - next to it it's it's by convenience but
42:33 - it's also by design where we want
42:35 - functions that are used by other
42:36 - functions if possible to be nested in
42:39 - the code where you would expect them to
42:41 - be right so I'm defining a function that
42:43 - I'm going to use here and I want that I
42:47 - want it to I want it to be nearby so I
42:54 - can see it and provide context so in
42:57 - this case we're going to write a get and
42:59 - this is going to be get all answers and
43:05 - this is going to take and what is this
43:07 - taking in this is taking in anything it
43:09 - is going to take in a nothing it's
43:15 - actually going to just return things so
43:18 - here
43:19 - we're going to return an array of I
43:22 - believe numbers cool and what we're
43:27 - gonna do is we're gonna take pretty much
43:30 - all of this and we're going to replace
43:34 - it with a Const answers is equal to and
43:37 - then we'll say that get all answers and
43:44 - in here we're just gonna go ahead and
43:47 - return turn this like so and what's the
43:56 - problem here
43:57 - oh yeah let's go ahead and put this in
44:02 - here very nice okay so I'm not worried
44:06 - about formatting and spacing that's why
44:08 - I'm not cleaning this up for some of
44:09 - your losing their mind
44:10 - it's what I'm what I'm worried about is
44:14 - cleaning up our function code so now
44:16 - we've put this all in one one function
44:18 - where we're gonna handle that and then
44:21 - the thing that heats us thought it was
44:24 - sorting the answer buttons wasn't so we
44:26 - might as well just delete this code
44:27 - while we're at it know that comments not
44:32 - relevant I'll leave that in there for
44:34 - the comment video okay so for each one
44:38 - dot HTML and even something like this
44:42 - this is this is actually so here we're
44:46 - updating answer buttons I guess this is
44:49 - part of this one we could break this out
44:50 - if we wanted to but I think that's fine
44:52 - but now we've been able to take a lot of
44:53 - this logic slightly change it and do
44:59 - something with it that that now makes
45:01 - sense right we don't really need it all
45:02 - in here this is getting all the answers
45:05 - incorrect and correct and if we wanted
45:11 - to make it more descriptive we could
45:12 - even put in correct and crashed because
45:14 - that's what I felt necessary to describe
45:17 - right so start going off your your own
45:19 - thing is like what's this dude gets all
45:21 - the answers what is all it's incorrect
45:24 - and and correct so maybe if you know I
45:28 - usually go with the verbal test for a
45:30 - lot of things and it helps a lot when
45:32 - when
45:32 - describe wouldn't describing functions
45:34 - yeah one other thing we talked about was
45:36 - eliminating boolean flags and that's
45:38 - sort of what I meant with this this
45:40 - if-else cuz that's really what it is
45:42 - it's a bullet I mean typically a boolean
45:44 - flag would be passed in here but in our
45:48 - application one thing that we could do
45:51 - is we could probably eliminate this
45:53 - dysfunction altogether and just do our
45:57 - best to have these trigger the correct
46:00 - code and we could go ahead and throw
46:01 - reset into each one of these when
46:04 - they're called and we can just say hey
46:08 - we need to make sure that this is only
46:10 - on the one with the ID of border box and
46:13 - now we don't have to have this sort of
46:16 - boolean flags if else that goes in there
46:18 - or or a flag that goes in into the event
46:21 - or the the the parameter or anything
46:23 - like that so typically if you can and
46:26 - it's not always possible but it's
46:28 - possible more often than people think
46:30 - it's great to do try and eliminate those
46:35 - those boolean flags so that you don't
46:38 - have to worry about them now somehow
46:42 - this is not I mean after I think I
46:44 - talked about it when it comes to
46:45 - variables about not having Global's but
46:50 - so in this in this project we have this
46:53 - CSS here which is you know we don't we
46:58 - don't even really do anything with it we
47:00 - just initialize it so we want to do our
47:04 - best to not have Global's and there's
47:06 - quite a bit of Global's in here and the
47:10 - reason for that is even an
47:12 - object-oriented programming one has have
47:15 - a SKU side effects as possible it's not
47:17 - always possible you know this so you'll
47:23 - see this like CSS global variable here
47:27 - honestly when it when it's like this or
47:30 - even you let me see if we're even using
47:31 - this anywhere yeah yeah we are
47:35 - I use but you'd probably be better off
47:39 - doing something like this where let's
47:42 - just eliminate this variable altogether
47:45 - and in here we are going to get the
47:51 - width the pack padding the margin and so
47:54 - we can eliminate this global variable by
47:56 - writing a function where we say
47:58 - something get CSS box model properties
48:08 - and in here we will go ahead and take
48:20 - all this and put this in here and what
48:28 - we're going to return and it's just an
48:31 - array of those values right now with the
48:33 - pad the vrdr the god I would probably
48:40 - rename a lot of this stuff so I'm going
48:43 - to guess this is order I'm also going to
48:48 - guess that this is margin and I'm going
48:53 - to guess that this is a border style so
48:57 - I start by renaming those even though
49:00 - this isn't about variable rename is just
49:02 - as important margin and then order style
49:06 - all right so that's what I'm going to
49:09 - return here which is with pad margin
49:15 - border we don't care about that right
49:17 - now
49:18 - other places where we're going to use
49:19 - this we're going to update it down below
49:21 - so in this instance we are going to say
49:26 - counts and I think what we'll do is
49:28 - we'll just do some array D constructor
49:31 - in here
49:31 - and we'll say this is equal to
49:39 - it co sucks well small properties that's
49:46 - a cost all right cool
49:49 - what's the issue here shadows there you
49:55 - go I think I think whiff might be so
49:58 - sort of global variable or might be a
50:02 - reserved keyword same with border no
50:06 - shadow oh maybe they want us to use it
50:09 - no we're using with so pad it should be
50:12 - padding I don't like pad either all
50:18 - right so here for padding we're going to
50:20 - throw it in like so for border gonna
50:24 - throw it in like so shadow a shadow damn
50:29 - no shadows variable like that I know I
50:35 - think there's probably some naming thing
50:37 - in here but instead of focusing on that
50:38 - on the video you just focus on the idea
50:41 - here so I'm just gonna throw out one on
50:42 - this so we're just gonna do some so
50:46 - string interpolation here into a
50:48 - mortgage in one and then we'll go ahead
50:55 - and do a border style one for oh it's
51:01 - not border so this is box-sizing see Wow
51:05 - box is one and go ahead and do that and
51:12 - then down here let's update our stuff
51:15 - boxing excellent now this is the same
51:27 - thing here I don't have to look into
51:29 - there's a shadow variable thing is but
51:32 - okay now now we've gone and created this
51:36 - this item here and where we're going to
51:41 - be using those CSS properties let's go
51:43 - ahead and find the CSS here here we go
51:48 - and say Kant's CSS is equal to gets CSX
51:53 - box model properties like so we still
51:58 - have access to them we will eliminate a
52:00 - global variable and in our functions
52:02 - we've eliminated side effects throughout
52:04 - the entire application where we have to
52:06 - we have to track like okay I set the CSS
52:08 - box CSS property here and now I call
52:11 - five functions it's this after this step
52:14 - this after this step you got updated
52:16 - here got reverted here we don't want
52:19 - side-effects like that we want to even
52:22 - an object-oriented programming to take a
52:23 - somewhat functional approach eliminate
52:26 - side-effects we're gonna be talking
52:27 - about comments comments are a little bit
52:30 - of an interesting topic compared to the
52:32 - other items because in this section
52:36 - there's more why we don't use comments
52:39 - and how to write good comments so that
52:41 - but those are gonna be our two main
52:42 - objectives so we're gonna be talking
52:44 - about what are good comments what are
52:46 - bad comments and how we can know if it's
52:50 - worth point worth having one what are
52:52 - some of the downsides of having them and
52:54 - how we can for the most part remove
52:55 - comments in why right so the very first
52:58 - aspect that we're gonna be talking about
52:59 - are what makes comments bad this is just
53:03 - two points there's a lot of other things
53:04 - but these this is a first example we're
53:06 - gonna get so these are the two most
53:08 - common reasons I would say that comments
53:11 - are used that the the major issue with
53:14 - comments these main two and then there's
53:15 - about five others were uncovering the
53:16 - second but comments are used when they
53:19 - really aren't needed
53:21 - and typically comments are used to
53:24 - explain bad code usually when you are
53:27 - writing your code at this point you've
53:29 - seen you know good variable names and
53:31 - we're gonna showcase an example of that
53:32 - good function names we're gonna showcase
53:34 - an example of that as well then if you
53:36 - write your code well in a descriptive
53:39 - fashion you shouldn't really ever need
53:41 - comments so let's go ahead and jump into
53:43 - an example so we won't focus on two
53:46 - things in here one where there's
53:48 - unneeded comments and two where comments
53:52 - are unnecessary right and I even talked
53:57 - about this in the slide but misleading
53:59 - comments as well one of the reasons you
54:00 - don't want to leave comments is that's
54:03 - another additional thing that we have to
54:05 - update another thing that we have to
54:07 - maintain its documentation essentially
54:09 - that we have to maintain and it could be
54:11 - counter productive to our code so let's
54:14 - look at an example of that first where
54:16 - we have a function name here called
54:18 - longest string it's singular at one
54:20 - point perhaps this returned a single the
54:23 - single longest string however examining
54:27 - the code and reading the comment here
54:29 - says gets all the longest string so our
54:34 - comment here is different than the
54:36 - function variable name and one thing
54:39 - that we can do to eliminate this comment
54:41 - is we can actually update this name too
54:44 - to make more sense right so typically
54:47 - your function names just want to be
54:48 - verbs and in this case we're getting an
54:50 - array of things so we're going to get
54:53 - the long string so we can eliminate this
54:55 - comment and now we have a much more
54:57 - descriptive name and this is these are
54:58 - things we've already talked about but
55:00 - here our next comment is a example of
55:04 - just a length length of what right so it
55:08 - here we have we're initializing the
55:10 - longest let two index at zero right so
55:13 - this comment doesn't make a lot of sense
55:15 - it's really unnecessary right so instead
55:17 - of length we can we can call this
55:19 - because let's look at how its utilized
55:21 - here we're checking to see what the
55:24 - longest word length is in the string and
55:27 - so we can do something like this longest
55:31 - word length
55:34 - easy enough now we've eliminated that
55:36 - comment we have one less line of code
55:38 - and we have a much more descriptive word
55:41 - and in this case we don't really need to
55:43 - put I've said in this case like 8 times
55:45 - but there's no reason to define that hey
55:48 - we're getting these ear that that
55:50 - comment basically said we're
55:51 - initializing it to a length of zero does
55:56 - that help anybody can no one tell that
55:57 - that's what's happening here it's it's
55:59 - very you just have to have read the one
56:01 - line of code in its they're adding that
56:04 - provides no additional value so we now
56:07 - can go ahead and put this into here
56:09 - we've eliminated our comments and here's
56:12 - another great example of a comment that
56:14 - really isn't necessary checks if the
56:16 - current string is longer well I think we
56:20 - can all tell that the current string is
56:22 - in fact like this is what's going on
56:23 - here this isn't an overly convoluted if
56:26 - statement this isn't a you know anything
56:28 - that's outside of the norm we're doing a
56:30 - simple single comparison in this comment
56:34 - here as well filters out any values not
56:36 - equal to the longest string we can we
56:39 - can tell that this is a essentially a
56:41 - one-line and even we could remove some
56:43 - characters here as well just to clean it
56:45 - up if we wanted this is a one line
56:48 - callback function here that's filtering
56:51 - out now one thing that we can do as well
56:54 - is to just hone this in is rename our
56:57 - variable here and we can call this
56:59 - longest words and what we've done now is
57:08 - we've eliminated some misleading
57:10 - comments or miss act technically the
57:14 - comment wasn't misleading but the
57:15 - function name was misleading but
57:16 - typically it's in the reverse order and
57:19 - we've also eliminated unneeded comments
57:21 - just by renaming our variables and just
57:24 - comments that really weren't doing
57:25 - anything right hey hey here we're
57:27 - telling it to to you know check the
57:30 - length like we can we can see that very
57:32 - easily two more things that people love
57:35 - to leave in that are really bad comments
57:38 - are leftover code that's code that we've
57:40 - commented out and then that we don't
57:43 - plan on using at that time and then
57:45 - version control
57:47 - so let's go ahead and give some examples
57:49 - now this doesn't happen too often
57:51 - anymore but occasionally some some
57:54 - developers will have this bad habit left
57:56 - over when version control was a little
57:58 - bit more of an issue and this this both
58:01 - these section I'm kind of combining the
58:03 - two because I think they stem from a
58:06 - place where version control is kind of a
58:08 - pain to work with so you have these
58:10 - blocks of code here where the whole
58:13 - prayer it's a log you know they're
58:14 - basically locks hey on the fourth of
58:16 - July you put a comment in and then you
58:18 - know on the tenth we put in you know a
58:21 - comment here all this stuff is handled
58:24 - in the version control with our comments
58:26 - and there's really no point or place for
58:28 - it in it now the other thing that is
58:31 - really bad practice is having you know
58:34 - you can comment code out when you're
58:36 - working when you're testing when you're
58:37 - going things but you should never have
58:39 - code commented out in your application
58:42 - when it's in production or it's moving
58:44 - forward the reason for it is you're
58:46 - gonna confuse future developers why is
58:49 - this commented out is this supposed to
58:50 - be commented in should I go and delete
58:52 - it if you're no longer using a piece of
58:55 - code delete it if you need to go back
58:58 - and get it that's what version control
59:00 - is for we have references to it there's
59:02 - tons of logs that have all this sort of
59:04 - stuff we can jump back in and get it
59:05 - there's absolutely no reason in today's
59:07 - world to have combinated code in in your
59:10 - in your production application so either
59:14 - come I'm coming back in because this is
59:15 - part of one of my actual projects but
59:16 - delete it from the application and move
59:20 - on
59:20 - with your your with your programming so
59:24 - visual markers are another really bad
59:26 - tendency when it comes to common so it's
59:29 - a visual marker essentially a just a
59:32 - block of code of a commented out code to
59:35 - say this is what is here this is what is
59:37 - there let's go ahead and give an example
59:38 - so I know we've all seen at least one
59:41 - file in our lifetime that has done this
59:43 - where you have these sort of blocks of
59:45 - codes that really describes what's going
59:48 - on with the structure of your page
59:50 - what's going on with the formatting of
59:51 - the page here you know dependencies are
59:53 - here many information here properties
59:55 - are here public functions are here
59:57 - really when it comes to structuring up
60:00 - and this is
60:00 - angular but this is the same for any
60:03 - sort of class or any sort of component
60:05 - or just code in general you want to you
60:09 - know that this is much like other
60:11 - comments just filler text that takes up
60:13 - space and room and if you actually think
60:15 - that you need to break out this part of
60:17 - your code you need to consider having a
60:19 - new file because it's the concern is so
60:21 - different that you need to put eight
60:23 - like a big block like this then maybe it
60:25 - is something that's entirely different
60:27 - instant we need to pull that out and
60:29 - give it its own sort of domain but
60:32 - there's no there's no reason to have
60:34 - these tags let the structure of your
60:36 - classes be what they should be right so
60:39 - tip properties are excellent example
60:41 - typically your properties would be the
60:43 - first thing in your class and you know
60:46 - followed by maybe a constructor and then
60:47 - a function no no real need to put
60:50 - self-explanatory sort of tags like yeah
60:52 - this is clearly you know the decorator
60:54 - meta information this is clearly the
60:56 - dependencies which come up at top by you
60:59 - know by standard so these sort of visual
61:02 - cues visual markers there is absolutely
61:04 - no reason to have it in your application
61:06 - the last sort of item I want to sort of
61:11 - caution you when it comes to comments
61:13 - are to do's so if you're not familiar
61:15 - with to do is to do something def
61:17 - selected e where they like to I'm trying
61:24 - to think of a different word than do but
61:25 - they like to do to dues to say hey go
61:28 - back and add this feature expand upon
61:31 - this remove this delete this and I don't
61:35 - really have any examples to show you for
61:36 - this but I just want you understand why
61:38 - it's bad convention for one a to do much
61:42 - like other comments or something you
61:44 - have to maintain it's something that you
61:45 - have to keep track of now if you want to
61:46 - keep track outside of the application
61:48 - that's perfectly fine but requirements
61:51 - change which means that to do may no
61:53 - longer be it to do and you may not be
61:55 - the one doing it but if someone sees in
61:57 - the code they may do it and it may no
61:59 - longer be relevant and in fact it may
62:01 - actually break the code it's just
62:03 - another piece of it's just another thing
62:05 - we have to maintain and that can cause
62:07 - confusion and issues down the road so
62:11 - please avoid to do's now we've talked
62:13 - about
62:14 - some pretty much all a ton of bad
62:17 - comments and if you've kind of got a
62:18 - little feeling from this side you
62:20 - shouldn't leave comments in general
62:21 - that's a good practice right we've
62:24 - talked about how we can make it we could
62:25 - eliminate the need for comments because
62:27 - comments are really there when we have
62:30 - failed to name our functions and our
62:31 - variables properly and in our code to be
62:34 - descriptive right we want the code we
62:37 - want the better structure our code so
62:39 - that we can tell what's going on in the
62:41 - code without having to leave the comment
62:43 - that's our objective here we write
62:44 - better code where comments are not
62:46 - needed now there are some times where
62:49 - comments are especially needed and and
62:53 - we're going to give some examples of
62:54 - what those might be so let's talk about
62:57 - the characteristic of some good comments
62:58 - and some comments that we have to have
63:01 - to have so the first thing is that needs
63:03 - to be short and concise it's whenever
63:06 - you see a paragraph of commented out
63:09 - something chances are a lot of that's
63:12 - fluff a lot of its unneeded or it's
63:14 - redundant and is it's going to cause
63:17 - more issues and not and with such a big
63:19 - comment it's it makes it even harder to
63:21 - maintain so we want to make it we want
63:24 - to make it short and concise right if it
63:25 - goes longer than one line you've messed
63:27 - up on your comment so you need to
63:29 - refactor it it provides value you know
63:32 - just saying hey constructor here we can
63:35 - see a constructors there but what's the
63:37 - value and so when do we use a comment
63:40 - all right so these next two things kind
63:42 - of our kind of grouped together but we
63:45 - use a comment when it clarifies code
63:49 - that has a business purpose but looks
63:51 - out of sort right so what I mean by that
63:53 - is there may be some domain knowledge in
63:55 - the system that you know newer
63:57 - developers may not be familiar with and
63:59 - here we we say a warning or an
64:03 - amplification of it's important to say
64:06 - hey I know this looks strange and it's
64:09 - you know there's not a cleaner way of
64:10 - doing this but we have to do this to get
64:14 - we have to do this to protect ourselves
64:16 - or we have to do this to provide the
64:18 - functionality that's needed and here is
64:20 - why so when there's something that's
64:22 - strange like that like oh I don't think
64:24 - we have to do this but we actually do
64:26 - that's where we want to have a comment
64:27 - comment for that business purpose as
64:30 - well as to provide a warning or the
64:32 - amplification of its importance and then
64:34 - of course legal comments legal comments
64:36 - there's no real way around it sometimes
64:38 - when you're using open source libraries
64:39 - you need to have a legal comment at the
64:43 - top of your file to use it that's just
64:44 - something that's part of it and there's
64:46 - other ones as well those are the types
64:49 - of good comments so let's go ahead and
64:50 - give a couple examples of a warning or
64:52 - or a amplification of importance type
64:55 - comment all right so let's take a look
64:58 - at some examples of what perhaps could
65:00 - be considered good comments so the very
65:03 - first one is a legal comment so as I
65:06 - mentioned sometimes to use open source
65:08 - libraries you they'll have you paste
65:09 - this in to one of your pages where
65:12 - you're using it and so these typically
65:15 - will go at the top there's really
65:16 - nothing you can do it get around it if
65:17 - that's what the the license says and
65:20 - this I'm just using a random open source
65:22 - library I just made something up and
65:23 - sort of what it would expect so gotta
65:26 - have that so I consider that a good
65:28 - comment not the best comment the next is
65:30 - an informative comment that isn't
65:32 - readily apparent right so something that
65:35 - show cases but needs clarification and
65:38 - there's not really a good way when we
65:40 - have these three different date
65:41 - matchings to in the variable do it
65:44 - without it getting clustered and
65:46 - cluttered and it's just not going to
65:47 - look all that good so here we say hey
65:50 - this regular expression it's expected
65:52 - format is these three items now or are
65:56 - these three items rather these three
65:58 - formats and so that's a great way to do
66:00 - it now that there could be an argument
66:01 - made that perhaps we could see this in a
66:05 - in a test for wherever use this function
66:09 - that's a fair argument but this is an
66:10 - example of something that I might leave
66:12 - a comment to provide value because I
66:14 - mean at first glance I don't think
66:15 - anybody's gonna look at this and be like
66:18 - oh yeah this is what it does no it's
66:20 - it's not like nothing like I so another
66:23 - thing is remember I told you about
66:25 - warnings or amplifications this is an
66:27 - example right so let's say we're taking
66:29 - in an ID and you know this might look a
66:32 - little strange to you when we're
66:34 - comparing these numbers that we're
66:36 - trimming the value that comes in and
66:37 - we're parsing as an int all this sort of
66:39 - stuff so
66:41 - perhaps what we you know and probably
66:44 - want to do that for this for JavaScript
66:46 - but say say there there was an
66:49 - outstanding issue and even this is kind
66:52 - this is best I could come up with
66:53 - thoughts top of my head but we're trying
66:55 - to explain why we're removing the trim
66:57 - from the from the string and the reason
67:00 - for it is there's an outstanding issue
67:02 - with the UI ulay arias injecting
67:04 - characters and perhaps we can't solve it
67:07 - or we you know it's something in there
67:08 - but it's a warning to say hey why are we
67:10 - doing this and why are we treating it as
67:12 - a string and all this sort of stuff and
67:14 - why are you removing the characters it
67:16 - shouldn't be passing any empty
67:17 - characters with it if we did our our job
67:19 - right right so those sort of warnings as
67:23 - to hey this doesn't really make sense
67:24 - this is kind of odd those are the
67:26 - comments that you have to leave for when
67:28 - when you when there's no way around it
67:31 - when there's something that you need to
67:32 - tell them like if you remove this trim I
67:35 - know it looks like it doesn't need to be
67:36 - here but if you remove it it's gonna
67:37 - break everything and that we haven't
67:40 - found a way to fix it yet or we're going
67:42 - to fix it but short and concise provides
67:45 - value of some sort telling you what it
67:47 - is and then legal comments now by then
67:50 - this you've probably said hey man
67:51 - so we don't leave comments anymore
67:53 - that's a good thing that's another thing
67:55 - we don't have to maintain our unit tests
67:57 - are going to be our form of
67:58 - documentation to explain how our
68:00 - application of all's our code structure
68:02 - should be clean and concise and follow
68:05 - standards and there's no reason for
68:07 - those blocks of codes you know comments
68:10 - for what a function does our variable is
68:12 - should be nut should be should be far
68:17 - and few between because we're going to
68:18 - name our variables properly and we're
68:20 - going to name our functions properly so
68:21 - that they're descriptive and and and
68:25 - show us what our code is doing instead
68:27 - of us talking us through comments
68:29 - typically are used as they're redundant
68:32 - and they're you know they're used to
68:34 - tell you what you can already see but
68:37 - worst of all they are a crutch for bad
68:41 - code and so we're gonna make our code
68:43 - better so we don't need comments if
68:44 - you've never heard the solid acronym
68:47 - you're not familiar with it don't worry
68:48 - bring it you caught up to speed so what
68:50 - are these solid principles well as I
68:53 - mentioned it is an acronym and the S
68:57 - stands for the single responsibility
68:58 - principle the oh is for the open-closed
69:02 - principle the L is the Liskov
69:05 - substitution principle the I which is
69:08 - one of my more favorite principles of
69:10 - the solid principles is the interface
69:12 - segregation principle and finally we
69:14 - have the dependency inversion principle
69:17 - so there's a lot bit lot of principles
69:19 - going on here five right so somewhat
69:23 - intertwined some of them all of them are
69:26 - important and we're gonna dive into a
69:28 - little bit about the history of the
69:30 - solid principles so where or who rather
69:33 - did these principles come from where did
69:35 - solid come from right because these
69:37 - things don't just come from nowhere and
69:39 - they came from Robert C Martin who you
69:42 - might more affectionately know him as
69:44 - Uncle Bob who is the author of clean
69:46 - code the clean coder and clean
69:48 - architecture which if you haven't read
69:50 - the clean code the clean code regardless
69:52 - of what skill level you're at
69:53 - whether you're a super senior or you
69:56 - just got started today I highly
69:58 - recommend those books and clean
70:00 - architecture I recommend as well but I
70:02 - think you should wait till you probably
70:03 - have at least a junior level role and
70:05 - there's links for all that in the
70:07 - description below if you're interested
70:08 - but with that being said he introduced
70:11 - it in a paper in 2000 about almost 20
70:14 - years ago on the design principles and
70:18 - design patterns and that is really what
70:21 - the solid principles are there are ways
70:23 - for us to write our code and deliver
70:26 - some things and we're going to talk
70:27 - about why we should write our code in
70:30 - such ways so that they support certain
70:35 - development practices now he's also the
70:37 - co-author of the agile manifesto and you
70:41 - might be saying well why is that
70:42 - relevant well because that's part of the
70:46 - solid principles goals you know if
70:49 - you've been working in software
70:51 - development for the last 10 years or so
70:53 - well you've probably seen is that the
70:55 - waterfall software development life
70:57 - cycles are dry and
71:00 - agile is a flowing river if you will and
71:03 - so that is what we're trying to
71:07 - accomplish with the solid principles is
71:10 - in general I would say that they are
71:13 - designed for object-oriented programming
71:15 - but that you can use them with other
71:18 - like functional stuff but it's most
71:23 - performance not the right word but I'd
71:26 - say it aligns best with object-oriented
71:28 - programming I would also say that it's
71:29 - language agnostic this isn't something
71:31 - that you just do for Java this isn't
71:33 - just something that you do for
71:34 - JavaScript or C sharp or you know your
71:38 - language of choice go whatever Russ
71:40 - whatever it is and that's one of the
71:44 - great things about it and it also sports
71:46 - agile so as I mentioned agile is sort of
71:49 - the way of the of software development
71:52 - nowadays and because of that it because
71:55 - of that rapid development lifecycle that
71:58 - you know if you're you're doing scrum
72:00 - you have two week iterations where
72:01 - you're delivering features every two
72:02 - weeks right you know we have you know
72:06 - some places are doing continuous
72:07 - integration and continuous deployment
72:09 - mean when it goes out it's out like it
72:12 - goes straight to master and so we need
72:15 - to make sure that our architecture is
72:17 - great and we need to make sure that the
72:19 - testing and the test-driven development
72:20 - processes are followed and the solid
72:23 - principles help us to do that so why
72:28 - does it help us do that
72:29 - well it help us accomplish a couple
72:32 - things it helps our code to be more
72:35 - understandable or readable it helps it
72:37 - to be easier to maintain and it allows
72:40 - it to be flexible so the strengths of
72:44 - the solid principles is it abstracts
72:48 - some things so it's so when changes
72:50 - happen it's it's much more flexible to
72:52 - get them to work and it allows us to
72:57 - extend things instead of instead of
73:01 - breaking things and having to rewrite
73:03 - things and so that it's much easier to
73:07 - add something than to have to rewrite an
73:09 - entire thing
73:10 - and that's one of the strengths of solid
73:11 - principles and it accomplishes these
73:14 - three things through the the five
73:17 - principles alright so let's go ahead and
73:20 - dive in a little bit to each one of
73:22 - these principles so just to get a
73:23 - high-level overview of what they're
73:25 - trying to accomplish so the single
73:29 - responsibility principle favorites the
73:32 - famous quote a class should have one and
73:35 - only one reason to change so this is
73:40 - about good Google good organization of
73:42 - your code and understanding you know how
73:45 - good inheritance works and understanding
73:47 - how to write our code in such a way that
73:52 - things are bite-sized to a degree and
73:55 - are not going to have more than it
73:58 - should write a a will give some code
74:03 - examples but there's a lot of and we've
74:06 - talked about this in other clean code
74:08 - series where you don't really want to
74:10 - pass boolean sin to tell it to do one
74:12 - thing or another for instance that could
74:15 - depending on this situation change the
74:18 - the logic that's happening not if
74:21 - something should happen but it's like
74:22 - hey do it if is this person don't or do
74:26 - it if this this other customer type that
74:29 - would might might be something where now
74:31 - we have multiple responsibilities in a
74:33 - single class we don't want to do stuff
74:36 - like that because it makes it much
74:37 - harder down the road to follow the logic
74:39 - to follow the code but it's all about
74:44 - keeping things in to the bare-bones
74:47 - minimum that a certain object should do
74:50 - and enforcing that with the single
74:54 - responsibility principle so we after the
74:59 - s comes the Oh open/close principles you
75:02 - should be able to extend a class
75:03 - behavior without modifying it so this
75:09 - goes to my earlier statements about we
75:12 - want to extend functionality we don't
75:15 - want to modify functionality and you
75:18 - know in a principles are in a perfect
75:21 - world I sometimes requirements don't
75:23 - come through and
75:23 - sometimes this is impossible but this is
75:25 - the general idea these are what we are
75:26 - trying to follow in a perfect world and
75:29 - so another item about this is you want
75:34 - to be able to if you're if you're
75:35 - following proper inheritance you should
75:38 - be able to swap in different versions of
75:41 - different services and items like that
75:44 - so you can extend maybe an interface
75:46 - that we'll go into in for your service
75:50 - or items like that and the open closed
75:53 - principle is refers to that it'll make a
75:55 - little bit more senseless code I did a
75:56 - very important job of explaining that
75:58 - but essentially we want to extend items
76:02 - without changing the code base right so
76:04 - if we're adding a new feature in theory
76:06 - we shouldn't really need to modify the
76:08 - previous code and if we have our if we
76:13 - have written our code in such a way
76:14 - we're going to we're going to add upon
76:17 - it instead of modifying what we already
76:19 - have the Liskov substitution principle
76:25 - and I don't know too much about the
76:27 - gentleman named Liskov but he had some
76:31 - good insight here so uh most of these
76:34 - principles are not necessarily Uncle
76:37 - Bob's ideas but ideas that he has used
76:40 - and and catered and somewhat tweaked and
76:43 - over the last 20 years or so put out
76:47 - there too and that's sort of his goal to
76:49 - get people software developers to write
76:50 - them and let's guy was just one of the
76:52 - many people along the way that have you
76:55 - know he has learned from I suppose this
76:59 - what I'm trying to say so with that
77:01 - being said derived classes must be
77:03 - substitutable for their base class so in
77:08 - any good object-oriented programming
77:11 - language you usually have a base class
77:13 - that you can extend to your child class
77:15 - a an example of this an excellent
77:18 - example on Stack Overflow for you to
77:20 - look this up is a square class extending
77:25 - from from rectangle so the the reason
77:30 - that this wouldn't you wouldn't be able
77:31 - to subset swap to essentially swap the
77:34 - base with their derived classes it's
77:37 - because
77:37 - function differently right at first
77:40 - thought it may it may seem that yeah you
77:43 - know what why wouldn't they why wouldn't
77:45 - want to inherit from the other right
77:46 - every square is a rectangle but not
77:49 - every rectangle is a square and that
77:53 - should be your hint right there because
77:54 - if you can't swap them out then there's
77:57 - something going on wrong here and you
77:59 - might want to rethink your approach
78:00 - right because let's say a you change
78:03 - usually in rectangle or in in a perfect
78:07 - square you always want the length and
78:09 - height to be the same so there might be
78:12 - logic in there that would handle that
78:14 - but that's not necessarily the case for
78:16 - a rectangle so you wouldn't necessarily
78:17 - swap them or inherit from from one and
78:21 - so those are the types of things you
78:22 - want to think about because there's
78:24 - probably a better approach than
78:26 - inheriting from a classes so that's what
78:28 - the Liskov substitution principle
78:29 - derived classes must be you must be able
78:33 - to substitute them for their base level
78:35 - classes so the interface segregation
78:38 - principle one of my favorite principles
78:40 - I like a lot of them but the clients
78:45 - should not be forced depend on methods
78:47 - that they do not use at first glance
78:50 - this this quote I could probably could
78:52 - show some better quote but the idea here
78:55 - is that you don't want to couple the
78:57 - code so tightly that you can't make a
79:00 - change without making changes in
79:02 - multiple places and so to help
79:05 - facilitate that we add a level of
79:08 - abstraction which we do through
79:12 - interfaces and this allows us to do a
79:15 - lot of things once it allows us to
79:17 - easily overwrite code if we need to
79:20 - right so like a common use that I use
79:23 - the interface segregation principle for
79:26 - is testing right so sometimes when
79:29 - you're testing on the front end you
79:30 - might inject an interface and it's going
79:32 - to that your service extends and then
79:35 - you can maybe mock it out or expect
79:38 - different things or override it there's
79:40 - a whole bunch of different things that
79:41 - you can do with that but the interface
79:44 - segregation principle is key to that
79:46 - because if we were passing in hard the
79:49 - hard
79:50 - code it's not hard-coded but the actual
79:52 - service call itself it'd be very
79:54 - difficult and probably actually it
79:56 - actually hit the API so we don't want
79:58 - that either but we'll dive more into
80:00 - that but the idea here is that couple
80:03 - twofold one that you should have a layer
80:05 - of abstraction and two that you
80:08 - shouldn't force people to use things
80:10 - that then makes it so tightly coupled
80:12 - that they they that you can't override
80:15 - it and that's the idea here with the
80:16 - interface segregation principle now if
80:19 - you haven't noticed by now I've said the
80:21 - word abstraction about 15 times and in
80:25 - the dependency inversion principle that
80:28 - will continue on so high-level modules
80:30 - should not depend on low level modules
80:32 - both should depend upon abstractions
80:35 - this goes back to depending on not
80:39 - necessarily interfaces although you will
80:41 - but it depends on instead of having your
80:46 - actual code depend on other aspects of
80:48 - your code what you want or to have those
80:51 - abstraction layers is that you code in
80:55 - there and that allows a lot of
80:57 - flexibility especially when it comes to
80:58 - testing and mocking things out and so
81:01 - the dependency inversion principle helps
81:03 - support that as well today we're gonna
81:05 - be talking about the first letter of the
81:07 - solid acronym the S the single
81:11 - responsibility principle I'll be your
81:13 - host as always still in Israel so what
81:16 - exactly is the idea behind the single
81:19 - responsibility principle well it states
81:22 - that every software module should have
81:24 - one and only one reason to change now
81:27 - what does that actually mean it means
81:31 - that we're gonna have smaller classes
81:32 - we're gonna have single responsibility
81:35 - classes and this is gonna allow us to
81:38 - limit the impact of change so you know
81:42 - what does this actually mean so this is
81:47 - a quote from Uncle Bob who is a very big
81:51 - proponent of solid principles
81:52 - essentially the Creator gather together
81:54 - the things that change for the same
81:56 - reason separate those things that change
81:58 - for different reason so what I take that
82:02 - to mean is we're gonna have Kohi
82:03 - where it matters and we're in a decouple
82:06 - our code where it doesn't matter now
82:09 - most people focus only on making things
82:13 - as small as a as possible to automatize
82:17 - things to such a degree because that's
82:20 - more so the issue more so people have
82:22 - things that are just too big but you can
82:24 - also go in the opposite direction you
82:26 - make things to minut and too small and
82:28 - but that oftentimes doesn't get any
82:30 - attention but I wanted to bring that up
82:32 - because that is an issue in itself so
82:35 - let's go ahead and I want to share this
82:36 - link actually real quick before we jump
82:38 - into the code but this is a this is a
82:41 - link to Uncle Bob's blog where you can
82:44 - read more about the single
82:46 - responsibility principle here and I
82:49 - think it's really helpful so go ahead
82:50 - and check that out I'll put it in the
82:52 - description below as well but let's go
82:55 - ahead and see an implementation example
82:57 - of how we might use the single
82:59 - responsibility principle all right so
83:01 - let's take a very simple example here of
83:04 - how we are not using the single
83:07 - responsibility principle and how we can
83:09 - go ahead and use it to make it better
83:12 - so I'm doing this in typescript you can
83:15 - just think of it as JavaScript for the
83:17 - most part now everyone should be
83:21 - somewhat familiar with the cash register
83:22 - right we have ways you know they charge
83:26 - tax that keeps track of our totals you
83:29 - know there's a subtotal typically
83:30 - Annegret the grand total which is your
83:33 - subtotal plus tax and fees so a very
83:36 - simple example here and we have a
83:37 - function called calculate total all
83:41 - calculate total does is we have it
83:44 - updates our grand total so it gets the
83:47 - total wit tax and then we email a
83:50 - receipt to to the client say hey thank
83:55 - you for your business your total was you
83:56 - know one hundred one hundred dollars if
83:58 - you're balling hard and you buy like
84:00 - groceries or something so you might be
84:03 - saying why is this breaking the single
84:05 - responsibility principle well should
84:08 - this email private email receipt
84:11 - actually be sending anything in reality
84:15 - and mind you it's an empty
84:16 - that or should the cash archer be
84:19 - worried about having logic to email or
84:22 - receipt and the answer is no it
84:25 - shouldn't what what should happen here
84:27 - is that there should probably be an
84:30 - email class or message class that
84:33 - handles this that we then instantiate
84:36 - that class and have it go there and the
84:38 - reason for that is it takes it's still
84:41 - going to send an email right because our
84:43 - mail class is going to handle that logic
84:45 - but that's really where it should live
84:46 - right and that way if we change our code
84:49 - down the road we're you know what we
84:51 - need to update how we email clients
84:55 - customers it's all in one central
84:57 - location and we now we now have a single
85:01 - reason to change right before we had two
85:04 - reasons we had well if the total changes
85:07 - you know if the cash register code
85:08 - changes and great we have it's right
85:11 - here but also if you want to change how
85:13 - we email customers and clients we have
85:16 - to go into every class that we had this
85:20 - email logic and we then have to modify
85:22 - it well instead if we have a central
85:24 - class that handled that we can go ahead
85:27 - and and do exactly that
85:32 - in one central location so it makes our
85:35 - code a little bit smaller and puts it in
85:37 - different files so how might we fix this
85:38 - well pretty straightforward right we go
85:41 - ahead and create a new what's a let's
85:44 - just call it email email class TS you
85:49 - can go ahead and export a class here and
85:54 - then here what we're gonna call this
85:57 - email and email is going to have a
86:02 - message and note shall we before we had
86:04 - to send receipt this is a more of a
86:07 - generic class where maybe it's going to
86:10 - be something like send message right so
86:12 - we'd have a public send message and in
86:17 - our example it just took in a message
86:20 - this would be a strength
86:22 - and this would go and email you know
86:26 - let's just say we pretend that we have
86:29 - something to say email console.log the
86:32 - message whatever our lard logic here
86:36 - does it doesn't it doesn't really matter
86:38 - and then we could simply go ahead and
86:42 - take what's here and we're going to
86:50 - create a in the constructor we can
86:55 - create a property here you know we'll
86:57 - call this public email equals new or
87:01 - public cotton maybe mail would be a good
87:05 - name public you know some new equals a
87:10 - new email you know just go ahead and
87:17 - import it from there oh you don't be
87:21 - better actually let's just make that a
87:23 - static method right because are we
87:26 - really ever gonna create multiple
87:27 - versions of it this is a little bit more
87:29 - of object-oriented well this is going to
87:31 - be a static send message and now this is
87:37 - gonna do the same thing every time right
87:38 - similar if you're not familiar of static
87:40 - it essentially means that this is a
87:44 - property or a function on a class that
87:47 - you can use you can import it once and
87:49 - use it and it's not going to be
87:50 - something that you're ever going to
87:52 - necessarily redo so here we have email
87:58 - dot send message our static method and
88:01 - we'll go ahead and just pass that
88:02 - message like so and we can delete this
88:06 - logic here and now we've set it up so
88:10 - that it has one reason to change we're
88:13 - still sending an email with the receipt
88:15 - but our cash register the only reason
88:19 - our cash register changes is this
88:20 - something regarding the cash register
88:23 - domain changes well now that we have
88:26 - this email class if anything in our
88:30 - email class changes then it will auto
88:33 - update if in our
88:35 - - right anywhere else were used in that
88:36 - class because it has a single purpose
88:39 - now and so that's really what what the
88:42 - single responsibility principle is
88:44 - trying to instill a good rule of thumb
88:48 - when you're trying to decide what's what
88:52 - is if you find yourself having to put an
88:55 - ore ore into your variable names and
88:59 - function names you oftentimes will see
89:02 - that you probably don't have things
89:04 - broken down enough and because of that
89:08 - you're gonna you're probably breaking
89:10 - the single responsibility principle a
89:12 - good way to to also help and sometimes
89:17 - developers will find themselves in this
89:19 - developers aren't used to like maybe
89:22 - object-oriented programming will find
89:24 - themselves into a situation where they
89:26 - start doing like boolean flags that's
89:28 - another example a lot of times of not
89:32 - always but where you might so perhaps
89:36 - extending a class or using some
89:38 - inheritance you might be having using a
89:40 - boolean flag to change between two
89:42 - pieces of logic that do two completely
89:44 - different things that's another sort of
89:47 - gotcha to watch out for when using the
89:50 - single responsibility principle we're
89:52 - now on the open-closed principle let's
89:56 - go ahead and jump right in so what is
89:58 - the general idea for the open-closed
90:02 - principle well you've probably heard
90:04 - this if you've ever heard of the
90:05 - open-closed principle many many times
90:07 - but software should be open for
90:10 - extension but closed for modification
90:11 - I'm usually software very generally
90:13 - we're talking about classes we're
90:15 - talking about modules pretty much any
90:18 - anything any aspect of software that's
90:20 - reusable we want to make it open to
90:23 - expand upon but close to modify that
90:26 - original level of code so what does that
90:29 - really mean well what it means is and
90:33 - this is my interpretation but
90:35 - essentially means we want to extend the
90:37 - code so that we don't have to refactor
90:38 - legacy code legacy code bean code that
90:41 - was there before we started writing our
90:43 - code before we started expanding upon
90:45 - this and this is especially
90:48 - helpful not necessarily in greenfield
90:50 - development but when you are adding new
90:52 - features to code or refactoring code so
90:58 - what does this actually mean right what
91:00 - it actually means is the successful use
91:02 - of inheritance properly you know how we
91:05 - can extend things using inheritance
91:07 - makes it a lot gives us some flexibility
91:11 - to make our code more wait for it solid
91:15 - and it allows us to change our code
91:18 - easier and allowed these changes to
91:21 - occur easier easily rather so that we
91:24 - don't have to worry about it breaking
91:26 - and it being an issue to jump into the
91:30 - code we have to we don't have to update
91:32 - it in multiple spots that's this last
91:35 - note here is a well-written class should
91:37 - not have to be updated in multiple spots
91:39 - now again these are principles these are
91:42 - not the end-all be-all there's always
91:44 - exceptions to the rules or exceptions to
91:47 - the principles but these are the general
91:48 - things that it will actually allow us to
91:51 - do so let's go ahead and just make a
91:54 - quick note
91:56 - saude principles are a lot of people
91:58 - have preached about them but one person
91:59 - in particular is Uncle Bob or Robert
92:02 - Martin as you might know him and his
92:04 - blog post here goes into greater detail
92:07 - on the open-closed principle and I'd
92:09 - highly encourage you to check it out
92:11 - just to have a you know multiple
92:14 - interpretations of it I'm gonna give you
92:16 - my interpretation of it and you can get
92:18 - someone who's much more familiar with it
92:21 - than myself because it's been preaching
92:23 - about it for about 15-20 years but
92:26 - that's a lot of words let's go ahead and
92:29 - give a live example now let's jump back
92:31 - into our previous example with the cash
92:34 - register you'll notice here that I've
92:36 - added a constructor that's going to take
92:39 - a balance and we're going to it's going
92:42 - to be a number of the balance of the
92:43 - drawer essentially and so a bad example
92:46 - of how we would be modifying our code is
92:50 - exactly like this right and so we might
92:52 - have a balance property here and we're
92:56 - gonna sign that to a number and it's
92:58 - somewhat relevant right so we're gonna
92:59 - say like this dot balance
93:00 - equal to the balance that comes in but
93:02 - now what's happening sir we're actually
93:04 - modifying the original code and this
93:08 - will happen again and again as we
93:10 - continue to expand upon our cash
93:12 - register example but you may be saying
93:14 - like Dylann well shouldn't the balance
93:15 - be part of the cash register and isn't
93:18 - gonna need you know subtotal tax rate
93:20 - maybe the grand total because we may
93:22 - have to you know find out if we have
93:24 - enough cash in the drawer but by
93:27 - modifying this we're now adding
93:29 - complexity to the cash register that may
93:31 - be what we really need to do is to find
93:33 - a drawer class that extends the cash
93:36 - register that inherits from that and
93:38 - that's where the balance list because
93:40 - it's sort of new functionality that we
93:42 - can actually make it a little bit more a
93:47 - little bit of a smaller class while
93:49 - still having access to that so let's go
93:51 - ahead and do that because that's gonna
93:52 - show an example here we showed an
93:54 - example of what we don't want to do we
93:57 - wanted to be close to modification well
93:59 - how would we make this open for
94:02 - extension all right and to do that let's
94:05 - go ahead and just create a little file
94:07 - here and we'll call this drawer cash
94:09 - drawer if we want and what we're gonna
94:14 - do here is we're going to export this
94:16 - class here I guess we don't technically
94:19 - have to export it but I'll call it our
94:22 - cash drawer cash dryer drawer I don't
94:27 - know someone will correct me in the
94:29 - comments I have no doubt and in our
94:31 - constructor here we'll go ahead and
94:34 - essentially do the same thing that we
94:35 - did it's gonna be a number and we'll go
94:40 - ahead and have a property here public
94:43 - balance like the number and then we'll
94:48 - set it just start number is equal to
94:55 - balance oh this top balance excuse me
94:58 - they stopped balance sequel to balance
95:01 - cool and now I'll just go ahead and take
95:04 - this out of here because we don't want
95:06 - that in there because that would be
95:06 - extending it but here we just need to
95:10 - extend
95:12 - our original cash register and when
95:21 - we're doing at least in type shape when
95:23 - we're extending a class we need to call
95:25 - super which is just essentially saying
95:28 - that this is a child or being extended
95:32 - from our cash register which is the
95:34 - parent here and now although we have all
95:38 - the access to subtotal tax rate
95:40 - calculate total but it has its own draw
95:43 - we have our own drawer here where maybe
95:46 - we need to use some of those properties
95:48 - later on we will we could have access to
95:50 - that we can reference them here and not
95:52 - have any issues and we've successfully
95:55 - been able to extend the cash register
96:01 - class without actually modifying it so
96:04 - open for extension closed for
96:06 - modification now this is just one
96:07 - example and a very simple one at that
96:09 - but these are the sorts of things that
96:12 - you need to think about as you're
96:14 - developing code right what separates a
96:18 - junior developer from a senior developer
96:20 - is the ability to not only make the code
96:23 - run but both of you will have your code
96:25 - running but having something that is
96:27 - going to last the tests of time the best
96:31 - our ability be easy and maintainable and
96:34 - testable - and allows change in a much
96:38 - more simplistic fashion so that's the
96:41 - open closed principle today we're going
96:43 - to be diving into the Liskov
96:45 - substitution principle our third or
96:47 - fourth video on the solid principles as
96:50 - we're working our way through and this
96:52 - one's a little bit of a doozy you know
96:54 - if for a lack of a better word so I'm
96:58 - gonna give you the very computer-science
97:01 - heavy and if you're if you've ever gone
97:05 - and pursued a bachelor's in computer
97:07 - science or really looked into the
97:09 - fundamentals of it this wording will
97:12 - seem very similar because a lot of these
97:14 - principles are worded in such a way the
97:18 - idea from that stance is if s is a
97:22 - subtype of T then objects of T maybe
97:25 - replaced with objects of s without
97:27 - altering altering any of the desirable
97:30 - properties of the program so this
97:34 - reminds me of college quite a bit and
97:38 - it's it's a little bit confusing right
97:41 - it's even for people who write software
97:43 - professionally there's probably a better
97:46 - way of explaining the concept that we
97:51 - can do that so what does this actually
97:53 - mean well what it essentially means is
97:56 - that subtypes should retain the behavior
97:59 - of the main type now we're talking about
98:01 - inheritance you know an easy way of
98:04 - playing that is children should be like
98:05 - their parents for what they inherit you
98:08 - know if you are overriding the
98:09 - properties of the parent then probably
98:14 - what should happen is you might want to
98:16 - rethink how you are abstracting your
98:18 - code and how you are inheriting your
98:20 - code and the structure that because you
98:23 - might have something wrong because it
98:24 - may not be a child right and a basic
98:27 - example is if I'm a human April is a
98:31 - human and that is our type and we have
98:34 - children and it's a duck something went
98:37 - wrong because we should not be able to
98:40 - have a duck you know it could still have
98:42 - a name property it could still have an
98:43 - age right but it definitely should not
98:45 - be a duck should probably be a human
98:49 - child no it definitely should be a human
98:50 - child we have to rethink it so the
98:53 - common thing that happens is you know
98:56 - that that's what that actually means and
98:58 - you know the way that most people
99:01 - explain this to you is that if you
99:04 - cannot substitute a child class for its
99:08 - parent class in your code still be
99:10 - functional then that means that you
99:13 - broke something that that class is
99:15 - inheriting because all your child class
99:16 - is doing it is should be extending the
99:19 - behavior it should not be altering the
99:22 - behavior of a parent class right and so
99:25 - with that being said let's go ahead and
99:28 - jump into an implementation of this
99:31 - because it's a little computer science
99:33 - heavy but you know we'll give a good
99:35 - example as with all things software
99:38 - stack overflow
99:39 - this is excellent example I think that
99:42 - really hammers the Liskov substitution
99:43 - principle down so let's take a look at
99:46 - the code here we all have a rectangle
99:49 - class a rectangle has a height and a
99:52 - width they are independent of one
99:55 - another right the height can be any
99:56 - value and the width can be any value any
99:59 - positive value I should say and when we
100:03 - set the height with a method and we set
100:05 - the width all it's doing is saying the
100:07 - height in the width now one thing that
100:12 - people suffer with and one thing that
100:14 - people get wrong about object-oriented
100:16 - programming is they oftentimes say that
100:19 - it models real-life that is a fallacy
100:22 - that is somebody who wants it to make
100:26 - sense but you are building you were
100:29 - taking the abstract and making it
100:30 - concrete you're not taking the concrete
100:32 - and making it abstract is how I kind of
100:35 - think of it and although there are
100:37 - similarities is not always the case when
100:39 - it comes to code and this is a great
100:41 - example as Y so we have our rectangle
100:43 - class and our square class as well which
100:45 - extends rectangle it inherits from it is
100:48 - a child of our square claw of our
100:51 - rectangle class and the issue here is is
100:55 - when dealing with a square and a perfect
100:57 - square your height and width are going
101:00 - to be the same thing and you'll see here
101:02 - we set the height it's gonna set the
101:04 - height and the width we set the width
101:05 - it's gonna set the width and the height
101:06 - and now what ends up happening is
101:09 - anywhere we actually want to use this
101:12 - rectangle class we are going to if we
101:17 - were to swap the child with the parent
101:19 - it no longer would be an accurate
101:22 - representation of what it is we're
101:24 - trying to accomplish and because the
101:27 - parent class here cannot be substituted
101:30 - although a rectangle it can still be a
101:33 - perfect square it defeats all other
101:35 - rectangles right it's not that it's
101:38 - impractical it's not that it doesn't
101:40 - really from a logical standpoint makes
101:43 - sense that hey let's extend rectangle
101:46 - for our square because you know it is
101:49 - that is makes sense mathematically but
101:51 - the
101:52 - Akala t of it is is that's going to
101:54 - break the substitution principle and
101:56 - cause issues down the road because we
101:59 - should be able based off the principle
102:01 - pass in the child for the parent without
102:04 - any additional setbacks so how might we
102:10 - how might we solve this issue if we
102:12 - wanted to extend rectangle well the
102:15 - honest answer is one you could remove it
102:17 - entirely which we could do here the
102:20 - other answer is we could maybe
102:23 - reorganize our code so that we have a
102:27 - shape class and so perhaps we would this
102:32 - is just me sort of free balling it but
102:34 - perhaps we create a new file called
102:35 - shape I'm gonna export class shape and
102:43 - in here we might have a public type you
102:50 - can go ahead and make that a string and
102:53 - that would maybe be enough if we wanted
102:56 - some similarities probably not what I
102:58 - would prefer to do but perhaps all
103:02 - shapes will have a height and a width
103:10 - and in here this also be a number and
103:17 - from this will have rectangle we got
103:23 - that out that extends shape and we will
103:33 - have square that extends shape and now
103:41 - we have a class that if we were to swap
103:43 - it in now it'd be fine now granted it's
103:47 - a very basic class and we don't even
103:50 - need type in this current iteration but
103:51 - here if we were to swap either one for
103:55 - the parent class we shouldn't have any
103:57 - issue right we're not gonna override
103:59 - height and width are still gonna be
104:01 - numbers take out the time and that's all
104:05 - we're really checking for here there
104:07 - aren't gonna be any side-effects but in
104:10 - our previous example we would have just
104:12 - fine by extending upon a rectangle
104:14 - because we can't substitute for them
104:15 - hence the substitution principle the
104:18 - Liskov substitution crystals will harder
104:20 - ones in my opinion because you you
104:24 - almost have to be you have to have very
104:26 - real-world working examples before you
104:29 - sort of run into this issue we're going
104:31 - to be talking about the interface
104:32 - segregation principle in this episode of
104:35 - code like a pro the fourth principle of
104:37 - the solid principles so what is the idea
104:41 - well the idea is to not force the client
104:45 - the client could be people consuming
104:48 - your your class or your object or other
104:54 - developers right so that could be third
104:56 - party in house but to make it so that
104:59 - they are not forced to depend on methods
105:01 - they do not use that's the idea so what
105:06 - does that actually mean well it supports
105:08 - the what we've sort of been talking
105:10 - about with smaller classes or interfaces
105:13 - this idea of role interfaces which is
105:17 - essentially breaking out into the
105:20 - smaller classes and interfaces that
105:24 - should be defined and we'll give an
105:25 - example of that and this supports
105:27 - abstraction because as a application
105:30 - continues to grow we're gonna start
105:33 - having these issues where I have to make
105:34 - one change in here and one change in
105:36 - there and one change over here to do
105:38 - this one change and so if we start
105:42 - following the solid principles and the
105:43 - interface segregation principle that
105:45 - abstraction will allow us to make those
105:48 - change in a much easier manner without
105:51 - having a lot of side-effects which is
105:53 - something we want to avoid so how do we
105:56 - do it well
105:57 - let's go ahead and give an example so
105:59 - let's take this very large interface
106:01 - here and typically a large interfaces or
106:06 - large classes indicative of a very
106:10 - complex object they have to say is this
106:12 - object does this object need to be that
106:14 - complex does it really handle this is
106:17 - that is this everything you want to be
106:19 - so so just sort of a red flag but you'll
106:21 - see here we have our vehicle interface
106:24 - just defining what our vehicle class
106:28 - would be right we have a get speed that
106:30 - returns a number a good vehicle type
106:32 - which is gonna be a string you know some
106:35 - some financing things you know as tax
106:38 - paid are the lights on have we started
106:41 - the engine have we accelerated and we
106:42 - stopped the engine a start radio how we
106:48 - [Music]
106:49 - function do we want to play a CD do we
106:55 - want to stop the radio so we have all
106:56 - these sorts of various properties of
107:00 - what a car or a vehicle might have and
107:02 - looking at this this is gonna cost us a
107:06 - lot of problems where every time we
107:08 - modify the vehicle class for any aspect
107:10 - whether it's the engine or the music or
107:13 - the lights whatever it may be we're
107:17 - gonna run in these issues where we are
107:21 - treating this vehicle object as one and
107:24 - the same and and the rowdy of the
107:25 - situation is that's not necessarily true
107:27 - so how might we go ahead and fix this
107:29 - well let's do a little bit of
107:32 - refactoring here where instead of just
107:35 - the IV achill
107:38 - we can have maybe in highlights right so
107:41 - let's at defining interface here called
107:43 - eye light and I in type scripts you
107:46 - typically denote an interface with an
107:48 - eye oftentimes I I'll build a abstract
107:51 - class because interfaces are just sort
107:54 - of ain't and you can do a little bit
107:56 - some more complex interfaces stuff but
107:59 - um I don't want to get too much into
108:01 - typescript but if we have lights
108:04 - why wouldn't we have it is lights on and
108:07 - have that over here and it'll be the
108:11 - same thing right you're just returning a
108:13 - boolean so you go ahead and take that
108:15 - out and it is lights off excellent and
108:22 - we could do another thing where let's go
108:25 - ahead and create a radio interface right
108:26 - because we're playing with the music
108:28 - radio and we would have our start stop
108:36 - and play CD that's all of our radio
108:39 - object and then of our I engine right so
108:44 - let's see here we have start engine
108:46 - accelerate that all looks like to be an
108:48 - engine go ahead and do something this
108:56 - interface alright excellent and so now
109:02 - you'll see that we've sort of broken
109:05 - this out a little bit more and we can
109:08 - reuse these as needed and if we needed
109:11 - to
109:11 - let's go ahead and actually say we had a
109:14 - vehicle class
109:19 - and we wanted to consume these things
109:21 - right the vehicle class is going to
109:32 - extend a vehicle like so no expense
109:52 - there you know a few months didn't you
110:03 - save this is that why it's not finding
110:05 - it there we go so and you'll see here
110:09 - that we need to implement some functions
110:11 - right we want to implement the get speed
110:13 - that get vehicle type is tax play so we
110:15 - can go ahead and define public get speed
110:19 - and I'll do something you know we're
110:22 - gonna say public is tax payable all
110:30 - right here for the time being I'm just
110:31 - filling this out real quick
110:32 - so we return that just return to one
110:35 - something like that and we have two more
110:38 - implementations and then we're gonna
110:39 - actually use the other interfaces in a
110:41 - second here so that we can consume those
110:47 - in a more responsible manner if we felt
110:51 - that we needed to do that right so turn
110:53 - this just an empty string here for time
110:57 - being
111:03 - well this is just a property excuse me
111:09 - just for the sake of time we'll go ahead
111:11 - and make that a function and then go
111:15 - ahead and throw that on there as well
111:17 - and we'll just return truth all right so
111:23 - now we've been able to actually
111:25 - implement that in our vehicle class but
111:28 - we might have other things that we want
111:30 - as well where maybe we have a radio of
111:35 - type I radio we have to export these as
111:45 - well but and then we'll go and we'll
111:55 - assign whatever properties to sorry I'd
111:57 - probably have a class in reality but
111:59 - what this gives us the ability to now is
112:01 - that all our radio logic is now
112:03 - separated out over here we have our
112:06 - various interfaces and we can use them
112:08 - and it's all broken out to what it needs
112:10 - to be right and we've now separated out
112:14 - piece by piece so we don't have to and
112:17 - abstracted it so that we don't have to
112:19 - rely on this a massive vehicle interface
112:21 - or class for that matter so you know
112:25 - it's it's a lot of these principles will
112:27 - sort of fall into that hole that each
112:30 - sort of touch each other like some of
112:32 - this may feel very similar single or
112:34 - responsibility principle and some of you
112:36 - may be saying like well why am i
112:38 - importing you know why am i importing
112:41 - radio into the vehicle class well you
112:43 - have to understand let's say we want to
112:45 - let's say one of our developers wanted
112:47 - to use just a radio right they had a
112:49 - need for a radio class and we wanted to
112:53 - follow that if it wasn't broken out like
112:55 - this they would then be forced to
112:58 - install the vehicle class just to use
113:01 - the radio so what we're doing is we're
113:03 - gonna have strapped it break it down a
113:05 - little bit so that you only care about
113:07 - the pieces that affect your development
113:09 - that affects your code and it's for a
113:11 - good object-oriented principles so as
113:15 - always guys I hope you found
113:17 - helpful don't forget to comment like
113:18 - subscribe and share and look forward to
113:20 - our next video the dependency inversion
113:22 - principle which is by far one thing that
113:26 - I would say I found I didn't fully
113:29 - understand but is by far my favorite
113:33 - solid principle and I think has made my
113:38 - software my code writing taken to the
113:43 - next level so I really hope you take
113:45 - particular interest in the dependency
113:47 - inversion principle we are finishing up
113:49 - our section on these solid principles
113:51 - going to be talking about the dependency
113:54 - inversion principle my favorite
113:56 - principle of all five principles mainly
113:59 - because I I really do use it almost
114:01 - daily and I find that it to be one of
114:04 - the most helpful I didn't fully
114:06 - understand why but the more and more
114:09 - I've practiced the solid principles the
114:12 - dependency inversion principle has been
114:13 - a crucial one for me to maintain my code
114:16 - and make sure that it's clean and does
114:18 - what it needs to do so what is the idea
114:21 - you're gonna see if you if you're going
114:23 - to do a Google search on the dependency
114:25 - inversion principle you're gonna see
114:27 - something like this high level objects
114:29 - should not depend on the low level
114:30 - implementations or high level modules
114:32 - should not depend on low level modules
114:34 - something very similar then I say okay
114:38 - okay so what does that mean well three
114:44 - main things that kind of duplicated this
114:46 - but uh duplicated the first a second one
114:48 - we wanted to pin on a dependent on
114:50 - abstractions festival string along and
114:53 - abstraction should not depend on low
114:55 - level details and we just want to
114:58 - generally support abstracting our code
115:00 - now the dependency inversion principle
115:02 - is quite unique in the fact that there
115:06 - are several great ways that you can use
115:09 - this and we've talked and remember it
115:12 - relates to object-oriented programming
115:15 - the solid principles and in our code I'm
115:17 - gonna give you example how I use it
115:19 - almost every day by creating mocks for
115:21 - testing and making sure that it is the
115:25 - test mocks match our actual
115:28 - implementation that
115:30 - as our actual abstraction class so that
115:32 - everything is synced up and working well
115:34 - together so let's go ahead and dive into
115:36 - it so let's take a little bit of some
115:39 - angular code this is gonna be a mixture
115:41 - typescript and angular and what we're
115:42 - looking at is a service here so this
115:47 - service is gonna go and do some API call
115:49 - our service is called hacker news
115:52 - service and christen you know it's
115:55 - pretty pretty normal it's nothing out of
115:56 - the ordinary but it's not utilizing the
116:00 - dependency inversion principle which
116:02 - would have us abstract a interface to
116:06 - allow us to not only extend the extend
116:13 - this but make it so that other
116:15 - dependencies are dependent promise class
116:17 - R and so let's say we wanted to mock
116:20 - this file out for testing purposes
116:22 - because you know we already have our
116:24 - test make sure Hacker News Service is
116:26 - doing what it needs to do but we don't
116:28 - necessarily want to actually use the
116:31 - actual implementation and make those API
116:33 - calls obviously so we're gonna have a
116:34 - mock class but there's nothing tying
116:38 - these two together at the very least we
116:41 - can tie them together and make sure that
116:43 - we don't have an issue with our mock not
116:47 - matching what it's supposed to be so how
116:49 - might we solve it well if you had a
116:53 - interface in this click in this case
116:56 - we're using an abstract class was the
116:57 - same idea but if we had a interface to
117:00 - invert the dependencies so that we don't
117:03 - really care about the low-level
117:05 - dependencies in low level low level in
117:07 - this aspect it's actual implementation
117:09 - of the mock the implementation of the
117:12 - actual service and instead we're just
117:15 - going to define the actual class itself
117:19 - like so what we're gonna do is we're
117:22 - going to take this and we're going to
117:24 - extend the I hacker new service which is
117:29 - fine was the issue here no this is just
117:31 - some tighter stuff actually ringy's
117:34 - implement so I have to say same same
117:37 - thing more or less and so now we're
117:38 - saying ok cool we actually understand
117:41 - that it has all everything it needs for
117:43 - AI hacker
117:43 - service and we might find out that our
117:46 - mock is doing it wrong it might be that
117:49 - there's an issue there so let's kind of
117:51 - implement I hack their new service and
117:55 - in this case still the future decorator
117:59 - but I thought this is gonna blow up but
118:04 - didn't but now both of these are
118:07 - extending the correct dependency it is
118:11 - extending the abstract class or the
118:15 - interface now in typescript we have a
118:18 - way of injecting the interface and that
118:21 - would be how we would actually consume
118:23 - this is we will inject the interface
118:24 - into the class and then depending upon
118:27 - our dependency injection method and
118:31 - angular you have modules to handle that
118:33 - it would inject your actual surface
118:36 - itself it's service itself while
118:39 - providing the the interface let's go
118:43 - ahead and let me show you some code of
118:45 - where you might do something like that
118:46 - so here we're looking at the module
118:49 - which is how angular handles its
118:50 - dependency injection or hat handles it's
118:54 - managing of dependencies might be a
118:56 - better way of saying that and you'll see
118:57 - that we are providing the abstract class
119:00 - that doesn't do anything but it is there
119:03 - to say this is what is expected of our
119:06 - service this is what our service should
119:08 - be doing we don't really care how it
119:09 - does it just as long as you meet the
119:12 - requirements and then when we actually
119:15 - go and want to have the actual
119:19 - instantiation of that extra class which
119:24 - is the actual surface itself use this
119:26 - class use that class and then if we had
119:29 - like a component if we were to do a
119:31 - component
119:32 - comp component - yes
119:38 - and we want to X at now it's getting a
119:41 - little angular 3 but if we had a
119:45 - component like so that's supposed to be
119:50 - component and we want to export whatever
119:57 - X for class something in the constructor
120:01 - the dependency we inject is the actual
120:05 - interface and then it's just gonna go
120:08 - and pull that class because we've
120:10 - inverted error dependencies we may share
120:12 - dependency injections on that that's
120:14 - just a little more of how you might
120:15 - actually use it but you get the general
120:17 - idea is that if you're gonna have
120:19 - something mocking a service or you're
120:21 - gonna what you will and you want to have
120:24 - a high-level object maintained what
120:27 - everything does if you won't think of
120:29 - that way and then extend that out or
120:31 - implement it out and that's that that's
120:33 - a very realistic I am that I use quite
120:37 - often for the dependency inversion
120:39 - principle putting out guys
120:40 - we found that helpful as always don't
120:42 - forget to comment like subscribe share
120:43 - all that good stuff if you're
120:45 - interesting in my courses I highly
120:47 - recommend the 100 I'll give them a
120:49 - challenge help you ace your next
120:50 - technical interview there's a link in
120:52 - the description below gate just for 10
120:53 - bucks I'll see you guys next time
120:55 - bye

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys I'm starting a new series called code like a pro and what we're gonna basically teach you is how to code professionally it's pretty apparent when you open up somebody's project and it's a hobby or they're just starting out and they don't know how to improve their code make it so that it looks professional it looks readable maintainable these are all going to be things that I've picked up as my years as a developer but also that I've you know I can't take credit for most of them because like you know I read books and I do courses and I've learned these from people with many more years of experience than I have so what does it mean to have professional code like what I mean by that well I want to give a sort of analogy to explain it a lot of times when you're getting started all you really care about is does your code run and does it deliver the features that you're you know the client wants does it work and it can and I'm assuming it does in both situations where you're writing professional level code and then you're just writing some code where you're gonna you know getting started and learning it's sort of like comparing a tree house to a home it's how I feel like it like there is something that's going to last the test of time because we have written it in such a way that it's going to be maintainable and easily update it and then you have a tree house which is going to slowly get worn down because we didn't build it in the proper way both shelters one's going to outlast the other so what makes clean maintainable code well we're gonna be talking about a whole slew of things in this series and we're actually going to be giving in specific examples not just like hey you should do it this way we are going to tell you how to do this way and why but we're also gonna give coding examples we're gonna say okay when I say variable names need to be descriptive and how what does that mean exactly and how can we showcase that our code will be now more readable by using something like you know object or ad structuring for instance to get us going here and see actually see in our in real time how we can take this set of code and now we make it this set of code and it makes a whole lot more sense so we're gonna talk about code readability you don't write code for yourself or the client even well I mean you do because they're cutting the checks right so but the reason the not the reason but one of the reasons that you write code is you write it for the next person has to maintain it right the average dev is a job two years or something like that and chances are that projects gonna outlive you for a very long time and so you need to make sure that you're writing the cleanest code possible the most maintainable code and to do that you have to write readable code so what is the link team to those of us who are new the concept well linting really is two things and these are always I whenever you're incorporating a tool you have to answer what I call the big two the what and the why so what is a linter it is a tool that you set up essentially one time usually per project that will flag airs programming errors bugs stylistic errors and suspicious constructs was I mean it's basically gonna catch syntax errors that's it it's going to find out if you're making simple mistakes in your code we're hey you're declaring this here outside of its scope and that's gonna break Java Script is one of those languages where sometimes we don't find if that happens until we work our way through the application so linters give us the opportunity to find those airs earlier and more often it also adds a readability what that means is we're gonna make sure that we our code is formatted in such a way that is the industry standard or is a standard for that language that programming items and that's the why so it's gonna catch errors syntax there sometimes for more than syntax errors it's gonna have trouble catching logic errors but yeah but that's that's usually more so a developer issue and we'll talk about how to catch those later on this something that can also be automated so you don't have to run it every time it's just there and we'll start picking up good habits by just sort of being trained by the linter to a degree and this will lead to more readable code less prone less bug buggy code and we'll be writing in better standards because of it so let's go ahead and jump into an exam all right so what we have here is a typed script file which is just JavaScript it's a superset of JavaScript and what we're gonna be looking at is you know immediately because he didn't intend this file to retire if we have some error so I'm not too worried about that right now we should have some worries but you'll see here this is before we turn the linter on by the way and so what's gonna happen here is we're gonna go ahead and turn the linter on and see hey let's take this file from someone just getting started and see how we could just clean up our code to follow the standards and don't worry about the setup of linters I will include as I mentioned two videos but I'm gonna go ahead and turn the linter back on and reload the app and what we're gonna see here is quite a bit of difference supposed to be oh there goes just a little bit of a hiccup so you can see that now there's something wrong with pretty much everything in this file and this is so where linters excel at is catching those small errors that are cement semantics in nature or that are you know we want to anything that we can compare that they're not logic based errors there our structure heirs they are formatting heirs items like that and so what you'll see here is that the standard for comments for instance this have a space between them and so that's something we can fix you'll see here that and in modern JavaScript you know the VAR keyword is essentially forbidden and that's what the word they use and it'll say okay this is something that we have decided that you know use letter constant so for the time being we'll go ahead and change all the VARs here and there's quite a bit right there's quite a bit to let so we'll change that to let go ahead and replace all of those far so we may have to change some of them the cons you'll also see that when we hover over this the CS lint is saying hey on average you can use you should be using double quotes that's in quotes that's kind of a silly one but you can change that depending on your preference but I think the the more important point here is that you see double quotes here singing quotes here is we want to have a set and 'red of what it is we're doing you shouldn't have multiple ways of how you do things like this in your code so let's go ahead and replace all the single quotes with double quotes but you can see how we're slowly going to make this file just look a little bit cleaner this isn't something necessarily the winter would do but from a personal standpoint I would say that that you know you want your codes spaced out evenly as well when we're getting started here your code needs to look like you cared that's really what code readability means as we're going through here so we'll go ahead and put a space here put a space here and there's gonna be other things that we're gonna want to do this file as we progress but we just want to make it a little bit more readable and we can do this in just a few more steps anytime you'd have commented code in here as well you can go ahead and remove that there's no reason to have that anyhow so right now you're going through the file we're doing these minor changes a lot of this will be syntax stuff so if it's important right we're using a let instead of a Const and there's there's hundreds of rules when it comes to this and so what you'll end up picking up are these good conventions these conventions that say hey what makes a good what makes a eight well what makes good clean code because that's really what a linter is therefore for what it can do in that aspect and you'll pick these up just your habit if you're having yam so what we've done is now we have made our code just using the linter and there's still some errors in here and that's we'll talk about those in a later section but we have been able to make our code much more readable much more understandable and to the latest standards and in terms of just basic TS lint things and linters to get going so laters are here to stop those syntax mistakes lint trees are here to get you the code in a certain manner in a cleaner manner in a more readable manner and they are the first step to writing cleaner more maintainable code this will be the more of the hard code like this is the only tool the rest of the stuff we're gonna be talking about this is stuff that you have to learn that you have to implement and one thing about linters and in our case we're just using TS lint but one thing is that you have the ability override rules because they're not absolutes right we don't live in a world of absolutes but these always help to get you going these always help to get you started especially when you're just getting started to writing cleaner code and in especially in a JavaScript environment where this is kind of a newer idea when you're getting it going and knowing maybe I've told you about it which is kind of occurred to me like this is where we should start today we're going to be talking about how we can define our variables and use them better to accomplish a couple objectives right we all want to be able to write software like a professional and these are some of the items that you need to keep in mind when you're using variables as well as defining names for variables so what is that going to accomplish we're gonna have three objectives by the end of this course you're gonna write code that is more searchable readable and understandable there's a lot of uh bolts there but this is what our objective is here and we're gonna talk a little bit about what those what how we're gonna accomplish those objectives now these are just some of them but we're gonna be diving into other things as well we're talking about following language standards limiting scope of variables we're talking about creating new variables versus reusing them eliminating magic numbers and magic strings and items like that in general we're gonna talk about naming varial in a good portion of time talking about that about choosing a name that describes what a variable does or what its purpose is not how it does it and then we're going to talk about what I called the this relates to name and the variable is what I call the parent or significant other test well dive into that in the code examples and we're also gonna talk about when we can use long names for variables and when verse short names and you know some of the you know how we can incorporate that into our code and more some of the and more sections we're going to talk about is the practices that a lot of people do that we need to break right you're actually causing more harm than good and those are some of the examples we're gonna give so I'm not one that really like looking at at slides I learn from the code let's go ahead and dive in alright so let's start with a couple different things here here we have a simple algorithm to return a factorial of a number it's not important about the code it's not important that's in JavaScript but the important point here is there's a couple things that we can fix immediately with our variables one we can start following the language standards right this is something that's very simple and immediately going to be apparent in JavaScript for instance you would never ever have something and I'll captain unless you're dealing with a constant and an actual constant meaning it's not an object or an array that you're going to be modifying but this is something that we need to keep in mind at the very least because before we can get get into the higherlevel things of hey we need to be able to to understand how to write good variable names this week we have to just understand how to write variable so we have to write this to our standards so we're gonna use our camel case lower case camel case which is the standard here and go ahead and fix this alright the next thing that we need to start thinking about is can we eliminate variables the less variables the better and this is actually some code I wrote from like three years ago so you know don't think that you know everyone writes bad code and we all improve as well as long as we put effort into but can we eliminate things this is something that we need to start thinking about because it's rather important and the less variables we have to maintain the better so in our example here we can actually eliminate this count variable altogether there's really no reason to have it and you know you'll see here okay what are we doing with it we're saying it zero okay can we eliminate it well yeah because number here which is just a number and this is typescript right and we're expected to return the number here just provide some context but count isn't counts doing nothing count is doing absolutely nothing for what we need to do it here is it performing anything different than number no then what we can do is we can just eliminate it there's no shame in eliminating variables when needed you know this is just clutter at the end of the day you should if you can't have as few variables as possible because then there's less moving parts there's less things that we have to keep track of now you start we start looking here where we have another no no at the end of the day this this is debatable but in my opinion we need to numb is not a descriptive enough word and we probably shouldn't be reassigning the values either as we are going through here as you can see right so we're modifying them which is now going to break this for loop but let's go ahead and create a variable that actually has a good name now when we create a variable we want to describe what it does or what it is and not how it does it a lot of times when people start getting descriptive you know I let me give you a very bad example of a variable name in this instance let factorial let total multiplications and we'll you know initialize it to numb all right total multiplications is technically true for a variable name but it isn't what we need to do here and it's not what we we should want to do either yeah so total multiplications is not a good name and a better name is factorial factorial total now what is this well it is the number that we are storing our factorials in our total factorial all right now let's go ahead and set up here and we can do it just like so and now here we'll return our factorial total and not some random numbnuts coming in let's give another example of some bad variable names all right let's take a look at this function all this functions supposed to do is return today's date now you'll see here we have this D and this is a very simple function but we have this D here and we're creating it now if we didn't know what this was and we didn't know what this was would we know what D is if we had a conversation so earlier I rec I talked about the parent our significant other test so if I said to you baby what do you think variable D is what would you say okay okay oh well what would you say if we renamed it to I said hey what do you think today's date as a variable would would be excellent that is the significant other or apparent test you should be able to Hansel won a piece of paper and this is the title really at the end of the day and it should be that readable when you get going let's go ahead and give some other examples let's give a few more examples of how we might refactor our code in a relatively clean project where we want to make it more readable and more understandable when it comes to our variable names here we have an algorithm that is going to take in some values a double nested array for when we last backed up some items that's all we need to know about it now the first thing that we can do is what we're going to be returning back is a are the file IDs that we want to update but you might be thinking hey we're just returning file elegies another way that we could up that make it a little bit better is it's actually technically we only want the ones to update so go ahead and make that more descriptive is now making this this function more descriptive in the process and you have an idea of what it is you're trying to accomplish it's going to update this like so all right next one thing I want I've talked about in the intro was that there are times to use short variable names and there are times you use long variable names now in here when your scope is very short meaning it's like a callback function it's returning something it is alright to be using short names such as here so we're having file IDs all we're doing is sorting it is I personally will still do file ID but this is an understandable situation especially in typescript where we might do we might drop that F put ID and then maybe we add a type of file onto here right and then it's it's just as descriptive as before but now we can eliminate a little bit of clutter but in terms of short scope of our variables like so this is completely fine if we wanted to shorten those a little bit but one thing I would highly suggest is that you start using tools that are built into the language where if you are going to iterate through an entire array for instance there's no reason to do a for loop like this we're iterating through the entire array and we have tools to make this more descriptive while still iterating through it so let's use a four of loop for instance and I'll talk about how we're gonna make it more descriptive so in our for of loop we're gonna remove some variables we're gonna remove all these ugly eyes and instead we're gonna replace changes eye with a more descriptive word that allows us to write cleaner more readable searchable and maintainable code so how can we do this well what which what we're gonna have is a change of changes and we could maybe let's let's just refactor it's one piece at a time so here we're not eliminating pieces of pieces of text here piece by piece by piece and it's a little bit cleaner now what are we iterating through well we're clearly iterating through our array of changes which is an excellent name and when you were talking about renaming variables make sure that you take into consideration renaming functions and renaming parameters because they are equally as important when you're moving forward and we'll have a whole section on functions and parameters as well but that's nice neither here nor another there but you'll notice that we have this change 0 and change 1 and change one and you know if you're super into familiar with the changes array it may make sense but we want to look at our code and not have to dive deeper we want to have the simplest ways that we can do that and we can use things in JavaScript and other languages as well where we can give a more descriptive descriptive descriptive descriptive variable name and assignments here while making our code so what is change 0 change 0 is greater than last backup time doesn't make anything but if we go ahead and create a Const air and we say hey let's do some will say Kant's is equal to what we want to change we'll create a variable here so each one these changes are ray will do a little bit of array deconstruction and we'll say last updated time and we'll go ahead and also create a variable here called file ID or updated file ID and we'll just set this equal to change and we have those variables now that we have this we can make our code here so much more readable we're saying hey is our code was our last updated time greater than the last backup time that makes more sense than change to zero right and was our updated file ID do we already have does our file IDs to update already include the updated file ID if it doesn't go ahead and add two file IDs to update our current file ID now with just a couple changes in our logic here not not changes in our logic changes in our structure we have eliminated some of the floating sort enough floating but index values that aren't needed and we have instead done a little bit of array deconstructing to pass in values and now this reads very very clear at least in when it talks about our variable define menemen so it's a weird where do you say one thing i wanted to say is don't be afraid to change variable names as well so the thing you have to remember when you're writing code is that it's always changed your I new features are coming out updates are coming out and even just sitting here I was thinking about this variable name a little bit and I was gonna move on to the next section by sinking this isn't even completely correct it's not that file IDs we want to update we want to backup files that's what we're trying to get here now we are storing file IDs in there but what is what is it we're trying to accomplish we are trying to backup files and so file IDs to backup we're not trying to update anything and so these are the IDS to back it up so don't be to jump in and change this and if you dive into the code and the variable names are bad or the variable names have slightly changed don't be afraid to go and change it a lot of times people are especially if it's code they didn't originally write one thing that people do all the time especially when they're getting started with objectoriented oriented programming is they start prefixing property names with the name of the class and it's a really bad item what I mean by that is say we have this cat class and it is our friend's cat that's whose cat it is and we want to update our friends cats age so we've just had a birthday you would have the properties right now which essentially are variables at the end of day of an object say hey cat age is now 10 and then our friend's cat dot name we're updating his name to be Tito we do not need to prefix property names in our classes so we could go ahead and just remove that like so this is something that people do all the time all the time all the time and I've been guilty of this as well so don't think most of things that I'm telling you are things that I've done and learned from there's no reason to preface preface prefix these items you know we have intellisense we can hover over we can see the type we can look through the code all it does is create clutter and confusion so when you're dealing with objects you don't want to be doing that another thing to keep in mind is when you have constants when you have variables older developers although it's not too common nowadays well use what's called Hungarian notation or essentially you're going to include the type in your item so let's say we have a type here and I remember our file IDs so we do 5 IDs and then you would include number at the end or at the beginning depending on the convention but this is essentially Hungarian notation now this is a very bad practice and something I encourage you not to do for one if you're using typescript you don't need to and most programming languages that aren't that is not JavaScript will have a type that you can assign to it what else could file IDs be it could be a string I guess I could be a number but this adds clutter and unnecessary is actually a dynamic type and so we get a number of string sometimes a string number what do we do all we're doing is adding confusion to our code so avoid Hungarian notation as much as possible all right one thing that you need to avoid as well are what we call magic numbers and strings for that matter when when it when you are but that's a little bit different magic strings refers to passing in a key into an object that you haven't defined you typically want to avoid that but here magic numbers refers to passing in numbers that apparently came out of nowhere with no context right so here you'll see 63,000 667 and point four four four seven do you know what this is I I do just because I had recently looked at it but it took me a second to figure it out this is actually the earth radius to figure out the orbital period so let's go ahead and provide contacts and context and we'll make this a a big old constant in this case and all caps and we're gonna set it equal to this value now we have a much better idea what this is and when go ahead and pass in earth radius actually I don't really like that now we're gonna do it like this if I was doing a global constant I might have liked that but either way so we have earth radius here and then what is this big ol number well it's going to be the gravitational metric we'll do grab metric and set it equal to this and insert crap metric here now our code is much more readable we do have more variable so that's alright but it's more readable which is the objective here so avoid magic numbers win at all possible another thing to keep in mind when working with variables is you want to limit the scope to be as small as possible and what I mean by that is you know here we have this beginner project that we've will be refactoring or we did a refactor and upcoming linter video but we we have a ton of of global variables typically you want to avoid global variables if at all possible and when you can such as like this answer buttons used in two spot it's used in this function here same thing with only used in this function the same thing I would imagine with this one and what's with this one so what we can do is we can go ahead and take this jump down to here and put it into our where it belongs which is in a more local scope to where it's at the idea here with your variables is you want to keep them as close to where they need to exist because it's going to provide the most context for how much they are useful right so you typically want to avoid the global scope if you can and put variables in the most limited scope possible so that you can get that additional context another variable naming to consider is when working working with boolean specifically there is a is for present tense or has for past tense in terms of the naming convention this sort of lets you flag it out here and we can you know typically we don't ever want to put the variable types in here if we can avoid it so we can do something like this where instead of is box boolean with is box meaning it is a box or it is not a box or if you prefer that past tense has box or does not have box in that sense the only thing I will say that when you are naming this keep it singular because part of our objective here is to make items readable and pronounceable so his box would be how I would go about it typically for me in the present tense so we can go ahead and replace box boolean with a box everywhere and clean that up a little bit so that's something to keep in mind when you're working with naming for boolean variables now this is a little bit of a personal preference I would say but one thing for variables is default parameters a lot of times you'll see people use this or you know if we have a invalid value here a falsie value but I would I would argue that if you need a default value for your parameters they should be which essentially are variables at the end of the day right we're passing data anything it passes data we're considering very well at this point but we instead want to have this value here the reason for it is now the reason for it is it's its default value thus you can assign the only the only caveat to that is that it does it work slightly different than our or operator so this will only assign a default value if it is actually undefined while here it will do it for any false a value so keep that in mind but in general you want to unless you have a good reason want to put it in your default parameters because it's in one location one one place to look at and it's it's in my in my opinion a little bit cleaner than using the or operator we're talking about functions our objectives for functions are gonna be pretty similar to what our objectives for or for variables we want to have readable searchable and understandable code which will lead to more maintainable code we could go ahead and put that in there as well if we want to but three bubbles seems like enough so are some of the ways that we're gonna consciousness us where it's gonna differ slightly we're gonna write smaller functions and we're gonna say showcase how we might do that and why and when might we might do that and we are gonna also go ahead and hide me for a second movemove there we go we're gonna move Dylan over here and what we're gonna do is we're going to eliminate boolean flags we're going to talk a little bit of all these things we're talking about why I just want to tell you why to do things this is the right way do it my way it's not not always my way but do it but can't tell you why that's important so uh we're going to talk about writing our functions so they read top to bottom making sure that's the correct way we're going to talk about correct function naming how do we know we're naming functions I work over about three four things that we can do to name our functions properly and give some examples we're gonna talk about limiting parameters and how we might go about doing that and why we need to do that we're gonna of course talk about the DRI principle which hopefully everyone's familiar with don't repeat yourself and why that's so important we're gonna talk about avoiding sideeffects in our code to the best our ability and we're going to be talking about why there should never be global functions these are some of the topics we're gonna hit on let's go ahead and dive into some of the examples this file might look somewhat familiar we're going to continue to refactor it so we've talked about one concept per or at least I think we have one concept per action item right so if you were going to get some data you might preface that with the verb get you know you're not gonna start using interchangeable words like retrieve and and uplifter i don't know why you wanna say upload typically you'd say get and that's the idea here and that goes the same for like if you're going to use the word update for updating something that would be what you would do you wouldn't say set you want to say update you you choose a verb to stick with because you want your code to be readable and part of that process is renaming the very by renaming the function names as well as in the process eliminating comments now I in future section we're going to talk about comments but right now we're not going to worry too much about it because it's more about functions but they kind of are interchangeable at times so we have random number here for the most part this is a this is a decent decent variable name some things that we could change about it is variable names are supposed to be verbs there are actions that are happening so how do we change this to verb well we add get we have getting on here is more descriptive of what it actually is you'll see here we have a min and a max I don't we could maybe change random number here to be get random number from range if we really wanted to be specific I think that's fine because I that that's that's as descriptive as we can probably get and you know this is typescript in JavaScript typically you don't have return types this is a personal preference I will say what I think makes more maintainable code is when we actually put explicit return types typescript is optional and in JavaScript it doesn't exist but in most languages you have the ability to add an explicit return type as well as explicitly saying what these values will be which I think are is equally important you know I think let's just go through this this project from the top to bottom and see if there's a way that we can update these functions just to make the function names a little bit more readable a little bit more understandable let's see here so this is our boxsizing prop add CSS to selected buttons and changes answers in box sizing so realistically I think this should probably be broken out into different app different different functions whenever I see an if/else like this I started thinking about how can I eliminate it not because if an else statements are inherently bad or anything like that but usually it's because they really are doing two separate things and I want to treat it that way so in in this instance I would define a Bock a function update see we're gonna update is Fox so select changes answers in box there's a update order boxsizing something like that and in here let's start it looks like we're not actually returning anything which is why it's an update but we know how to put a void return type and instead let's start by here passing this in here that should all still be the same and then in here and I think we'll do a little bit more updating in a second as well this dot update order boxsizing else this is going to be content blocks function update content box sizing it looks like we're not going to be taking anything in else in here try to put a void on that and we're gonna go ahead and paste this in here like so and go ahead and do this update content books I think I'm sorry we don't need to this on here because we're not working within a class it's just a generic type search application so we've now put all the logic in two separate files and if and we're saying at the end of here reset so we have this double order box and our else and we've sort of put these in two smaller functions that's really one of the things if your functions more than ten lines long you need to start reconsidering reconsidering how we might be able to how we might be able to go about and refactor the and you know that that includes renaming these to provide additional context like we could probably have guessed based off the content that was in here that hey if border box is true update border box sizing but and then reading through here to see oh well we're updating content box right and that's how we did it to name this but a better way of doing that is to write cleaner more maintainable code as we can and then that that way also we can test these functions individually as well we'll say hey update content box sizing that makes sense an update border boxsizing it's a more descriptive variable name and it's easier to read here as well and and what happens on top of that I guess is that once you you know if any of the codes breaking you're obviously gonna look at these functions but when you're looking at this sort of container this public function public function mean meaning the users going to be dealing with it while these would probably be private functions meaning that the user doesn't even know they exist they just see that there's something that says update border box sizing update content box saucing they can't actually call these directly then we have a month we really only have to maintain one function and be able to read one function to see what it does in the in the meantime unless something breaks or isn't working properly okay so this would be a a great example of how we might might modify a name here this so we have this add points where we're incrementing points and you can make the argument that perhaps what we're actually doing here is updating the points add is a little bit more descriptive but update update points by one by by I so this is a unique one because it looks like we're always incrementing so you might actually be able to say that hey when we're always incrementing add is a good name so I take it back I think this is a good value here and then we are calling great job after the fact now this is more of a form anything and we'll do a formatting video but typically you want and we'll leave it but typically you're gonna want to say your a lot you want two separate blocks of code baseball spaces let's see here uh so this is probably a a name that we would refactor very quickly and the reason for it it's great job is that descriptive right it doesn't really provide any context it is it is sort of a funny name in the fact that like oh great job what is what is this actually probably a completion and animation this would be something like trigger completion something like that like you have animation probably on top of there here we are saying like hey you completed it it's an animation in this trigger set right so this is much more descriptive than great job let's see if we have any more great jobs out there nope just the one in here alright so cool so we're triggering our completion animation and I may have this slightly wrong but triggering animation is right there may be a trigger add points animation that might even be something that makes sense we're now adding points I'm making the assumption that hey this is this is something that is uh this is something that is after they they're completed the the example let's see here set styles so I definitely would change this to update styles because we are trying to do one concept one verb per concept right and you also notice that a good job was not a verb as well functions and methods these are verbs and we need to treat them as such right so I'm not really take so here we're gonna do update CSS display again because we are updating a ton of different values here yeah we'll leave it at that I think so answer buttons a whole lot going on in this thing let me take a quicker look crow quick there's another great example of how we're going to set different values here there's a lot going on in this function here and to be honest I'm not fully sure everything that's going on here we're gonna delete this line of code because I don't do dick all right so it sounds like this is updating the answer buttons so we're gonna update answer and I mean you could to preview TN but there's really no reason to don't be afraid to have a long variable names long variable names are descriptive variable names typically we have three things here you know we all use intellisense it doesn't matter that we're using extra extra buttons these are all all the great things so uh how would we so I think what we're gonna do here is we're going to this incorrect won't ever use it incredible and correct one and correct so CSS is that here is a global election so I'm going to and notice by the way how when I'm writing these additional functions that we're gonna break out our code it's always right next to it it's it's by convenience but it's also by design where we want functions that are used by other functions if possible to be nested in the code where you would expect them to be right so I'm defining a function that I'm going to use here and I want that I want it to I want it to be nearby so I can see it and provide context so in this case we're going to write a get and this is going to be get all answers and this is going to take and what is this taking in this is taking in anything it is going to take in a nothing it's actually going to just return things so here we're going to return an array of I believe numbers cool and what we're gonna do is we're gonna take pretty much all of this and we're going to replace it with a Const answers is equal to and then we'll say that get all answers and in here we're just gonna go ahead and return turn this like so and what's the problem here oh yeah let's go ahead and put this in here very nice okay so I'm not worried about formatting and spacing that's why I'm not cleaning this up for some of your losing their mind it's what I'm what I'm worried about is cleaning up our function code so now we've put this all in one one function where we're gonna handle that and then the thing that heats us thought it was sorting the answer buttons wasn't so we might as well just delete this code while we're at it know that comments not relevant I'll leave that in there for the comment video okay so for each one dot HTML and even something like this this is this is actually so here we're updating answer buttons I guess this is part of this one we could break this out if we wanted to but I think that's fine but now we've been able to take a lot of this logic slightly change it and do something with it that that now makes sense right we don't really need it all in here this is getting all the answers incorrect and correct and if we wanted to make it more descriptive we could even put in correct and crashed because that's what I felt necessary to describe right so start going off your your own thing is like what's this dude gets all the answers what is all it's incorrect and and correct so maybe if you know I usually go with the verbal test for a lot of things and it helps a lot when when describe wouldn't describing functions yeah one other thing we talked about was eliminating boolean flags and that's sort of what I meant with this this ifelse cuz that's really what it is it's a bullet I mean typically a boolean flag would be passed in here but in our application one thing that we could do is we could probably eliminate this dysfunction altogether and just do our best to have these trigger the correct code and we could go ahead and throw reset into each one of these when they're called and we can just say hey we need to make sure that this is only on the one with the ID of border box and now we don't have to have this sort of boolean flags if else that goes in there or or a flag that goes in into the event or the the the parameter or anything like that so typically if you can and it's not always possible but it's possible more often than people think it's great to do try and eliminate those those boolean flags so that you don't have to worry about them now somehow this is not I mean after I think I talked about it when it comes to variables about not having Global's but so in this in this project we have this CSS here which is you know we don't we don't even really do anything with it we just initialize it so we want to do our best to not have Global's and there's quite a bit of Global's in here and the reason for that is even an objectoriented programming one has have a SKU side effects as possible it's not always possible you know this so you'll see this like CSS global variable here honestly when it when it's like this or even you let me see if we're even using this anywhere yeah yeah we are I use but you'd probably be better off doing something like this where let's just eliminate this variable altogether and in here we are going to get the width the pack padding the margin and so we can eliminate this global variable by writing a function where we say something get CSS box model properties and in here we will go ahead and take all this and put this in here and what we're going to return and it's just an array of those values right now with the pad the vrdr the god I would probably rename a lot of this stuff so I'm going to guess this is order I'm also going to guess that this is margin and I'm going to guess that this is a border style so I start by renaming those even though this isn't about variable rename is just as important margin and then order style all right so that's what I'm going to return here which is with pad margin border we don't care about that right now other places where we're going to use this we're going to update it down below so in this instance we are going to say counts and I think what we'll do is we'll just do some array D constructor in here and we'll say this is equal to it co sucks well small properties that's a cost all right cool what's the issue here shadows there you go I think I think whiff might be so sort of global variable or might be a reserved keyword same with border no shadow oh maybe they want us to use it no we're using with so pad it should be padding I don't like pad either all right so here for padding we're going to throw it in like so for border gonna throw it in like so shadow a shadow damn no shadows variable like that I know I think there's probably some naming thing in here but instead of focusing on that on the video you just focus on the idea here so I'm just gonna throw out one on this so we're just gonna do some so string interpolation here into a mortgage in one and then we'll go ahead and do a border style one for oh it's not border so this is boxsizing see Wow box is one and go ahead and do that and then down here let's update our stuff boxing excellent now this is the same thing here I don't have to look into there's a shadow variable thing is but okay now now we've gone and created this this item here and where we're going to be using those CSS properties let's go ahead and find the CSS here here we go and say Kant's CSS is equal to gets CSX box model properties like so we still have access to them we will eliminate a global variable and in our functions we've eliminated side effects throughout the entire application where we have to we have to track like okay I set the CSS box CSS property here and now I call five functions it's this after this step this after this step you got updated here got reverted here we don't want sideeffects like that we want to even an objectoriented programming to take a somewhat functional approach eliminate sideeffects we're gonna be talking about comments comments are a little bit of an interesting topic compared to the other items because in this section there's more why we don't use comments and how to write good comments so that but those are gonna be our two main objectives so we're gonna be talking about what are good comments what are bad comments and how we can know if it's worth point worth having one what are some of the downsides of having them and how we can for the most part remove comments in why right so the very first aspect that we're gonna be talking about are what makes comments bad this is just two points there's a lot of other things but these this is a first example we're gonna get so these are the two most common reasons I would say that comments are used that the the major issue with comments these main two and then there's about five others were uncovering the second but comments are used when they really aren't needed and typically comments are used to explain bad code usually when you are writing your code at this point you've seen you know good variable names and we're gonna showcase an example of that good function names we're gonna showcase an example of that as well then if you write your code well in a descriptive fashion you shouldn't really ever need comments so let's go ahead and jump into an example so we won't focus on two things in here one where there's unneeded comments and two where comments are unnecessary right and I even talked about this in the slide but misleading comments as well one of the reasons you don't want to leave comments is that's another additional thing that we have to update another thing that we have to maintain its documentation essentially that we have to maintain and it could be counter productive to our code so let's look at an example of that first where we have a function name here called longest string it's singular at one point perhaps this returned a single the single longest string however examining the code and reading the comment here says gets all the longest string so our comment here is different than the function variable name and one thing that we can do to eliminate this comment is we can actually update this name too to make more sense right so typically your function names just want to be verbs and in this case we're getting an array of things so we're going to get the long string so we can eliminate this comment and now we have a much more descriptive name and this is these are things we've already talked about but here our next comment is a example of just a length length of what right so it here we have we're initializing the longest let two index at zero right so this comment doesn't make a lot of sense it's really unnecessary right so instead of length we can we can call this because let's look at how its utilized here we're checking to see what the longest word length is in the string and so we can do something like this longest word length easy enough now we've eliminated that comment we have one less line of code and we have a much more descriptive word and in this case we don't really need to put I've said in this case like 8 times but there's no reason to define that hey we're getting these ear that that comment basically said we're initializing it to a length of zero does that help anybody can no one tell that that's what's happening here it's it's very you just have to have read the one line of code in its they're adding that provides no additional value so we now can go ahead and put this into here we've eliminated our comments and here's another great example of a comment that really isn't necessary checks if the current string is longer well I think we can all tell that the current string is in fact like this is what's going on here this isn't an overly convoluted if statement this isn't a you know anything that's outside of the norm we're doing a simple single comparison in this comment here as well filters out any values not equal to the longest string we can we can tell that this is a essentially a oneline and even we could remove some characters here as well just to clean it up if we wanted this is a one line callback function here that's filtering out now one thing that we can do as well is to just hone this in is rename our variable here and we can call this longest words and what we've done now is we've eliminated some misleading comments or miss act technically the comment wasn't misleading but the function name was misleading but typically it's in the reverse order and we've also eliminated unneeded comments just by renaming our variables and just comments that really weren't doing anything right hey hey here we're telling it to to you know check the length like we can we can see that very easily two more things that people love to leave in that are really bad comments are leftover code that's code that we've commented out and then that we don't plan on using at that time and then version control so let's go ahead and give some examples now this doesn't happen too often anymore but occasionally some some developers will have this bad habit left over when version control was a little bit more of an issue and this this both these section I'm kind of combining the two because I think they stem from a place where version control is kind of a pain to work with so you have these blocks of code here where the whole prayer it's a log you know they're basically locks hey on the fourth of July you put a comment in and then you know on the tenth we put in you know a comment here all this stuff is handled in the version control with our comments and there's really no point or place for it in it now the other thing that is really bad practice is having you know you can comment code out when you're working when you're testing when you're going things but you should never have code commented out in your application when it's in production or it's moving forward the reason for it is you're gonna confuse future developers why is this commented out is this supposed to be commented in should I go and delete it if you're no longer using a piece of code delete it if you need to go back and get it that's what version control is for we have references to it there's tons of logs that have all this sort of stuff we can jump back in and get it there's absolutely no reason in today's world to have combinated code in in your in your production application so either come I'm coming back in because this is part of one of my actual projects but delete it from the application and move on with your your with your programming so visual markers are another really bad tendency when it comes to common so it's a visual marker essentially a just a block of code of a commented out code to say this is what is here this is what is there let's go ahead and give an example so I know we've all seen at least one file in our lifetime that has done this where you have these sort of blocks of codes that really describes what's going on with the structure of your page what's going on with the formatting of the page here you know dependencies are here many information here properties are here public functions are here really when it comes to structuring up and this is angular but this is the same for any sort of class or any sort of component or just code in general you want to you know that this is much like other comments just filler text that takes up space and room and if you actually think that you need to break out this part of your code you need to consider having a new file because it's the concern is so different that you need to put eight like a big block like this then maybe it is something that's entirely different instant we need to pull that out and give it its own sort of domain but there's no there's no reason to have these tags let the structure of your classes be what they should be right so tip properties are excellent example typically your properties would be the first thing in your class and you know followed by maybe a constructor and then a function no no real need to put selfexplanatory sort of tags like yeah this is clearly you know the decorator meta information this is clearly the dependencies which come up at top by you know by standard so these sort of visual cues visual markers there is absolutely no reason to have it in your application the last sort of item I want to sort of caution you when it comes to comments are to do's so if you're not familiar with to do is to do something def selected e where they like to I'm trying to think of a different word than do but they like to do to dues to say hey go back and add this feature expand upon this remove this delete this and I don't really have any examples to show you for this but I just want you understand why it's bad convention for one a to do much like other comments or something you have to maintain it's something that you have to keep track of now if you want to keep track outside of the application that's perfectly fine but requirements change which means that to do may no longer be it to do and you may not be the one doing it but if someone sees in the code they may do it and it may no longer be relevant and in fact it may actually break the code it's just another piece of it's just another thing we have to maintain and that can cause confusion and issues down the road so please avoid to do's now we've talked about some pretty much all a ton of bad comments and if you've kind of got a little feeling from this side you shouldn't leave comments in general that's a good practice right we've talked about how we can make it we could eliminate the need for comments because comments are really there when we have failed to name our functions and our variables properly and in our code to be descriptive right we want the code we want the better structure our code so that we can tell what's going on in the code without having to leave the comment that's our objective here we write better code where comments are not needed now there are some times where comments are especially needed and and we're going to give some examples of what those might be so let's talk about the characteristic of some good comments and some comments that we have to have to have so the first thing is that needs to be short and concise it's whenever you see a paragraph of commented out something chances are a lot of that's fluff a lot of its unneeded or it's redundant and is it's going to cause more issues and not and with such a big comment it's it makes it even harder to maintain so we want to make it we want to make it short and concise right if it goes longer than one line you've messed up on your comment so you need to refactor it it provides value you know just saying hey constructor here we can see a constructors there but what's the value and so when do we use a comment all right so these next two things kind of our kind of grouped together but we use a comment when it clarifies code that has a business purpose but looks out of sort right so what I mean by that is there may be some domain knowledge in the system that you know newer developers may not be familiar with and here we we say a warning or an amplification of it's important to say hey I know this looks strange and it's you know there's not a cleaner way of doing this but we have to do this to get we have to do this to protect ourselves or we have to do this to provide the functionality that's needed and here is why so when there's something that's strange like that like oh I don't think we have to do this but we actually do that's where we want to have a comment comment for that business purpose as well as to provide a warning or the amplification of its importance and then of course legal comments legal comments there's no real way around it sometimes when you're using open source libraries you need to have a legal comment at the top of your file to use it that's just something that's part of it and there's other ones as well those are the types of good comments so let's go ahead and give a couple examples of a warning or or a amplification of importance type comment all right so let's take a look at some examples of what perhaps could be considered good comments so the very first one is a legal comment so as I mentioned sometimes to use open source libraries you they'll have you paste this in to one of your pages where you're using it and so these typically will go at the top there's really nothing you can do it get around it if that's what the the license says and this I'm just using a random open source library I just made something up and sort of what it would expect so gotta have that so I consider that a good comment not the best comment the next is an informative comment that isn't readily apparent right so something that show cases but needs clarification and there's not really a good way when we have these three different date matchings to in the variable do it without it getting clustered and cluttered and it's just not going to look all that good so here we say hey this regular expression it's expected format is these three items now or are these three items rather these three formats and so that's a great way to do it now that there could be an argument made that perhaps we could see this in a in a test for wherever use this function that's a fair argument but this is an example of something that I might leave a comment to provide value because I mean at first glance I don't think anybody's gonna look at this and be like oh yeah this is what it does no it's it's not like nothing like I so another thing is remember I told you about warnings or amplifications this is an example right so let's say we're taking in an ID and you know this might look a little strange to you when we're comparing these numbers that we're trimming the value that comes in and we're parsing as an int all this sort of stuff so perhaps what we you know and probably want to do that for this for JavaScript but say say there there was an outstanding issue and even this is kind this is best I could come up with thoughts top of my head but we're trying to explain why we're removing the trim from the from the string and the reason for it is there's an outstanding issue with the UI ulay arias injecting characters and perhaps we can't solve it or we you know it's something in there but it's a warning to say hey why are we doing this and why are we treating it as a string and all this sort of stuff and why are you removing the characters it shouldn't be passing any empty characters with it if we did our our job right right so those sort of warnings as to hey this doesn't really make sense this is kind of odd those are the comments that you have to leave for when when you when there's no way around it when there's something that you need to tell them like if you remove this trim I know it looks like it doesn't need to be here but if you remove it it's gonna break everything and that we haven't found a way to fix it yet or we're going to fix it but short and concise provides value of some sort telling you what it is and then legal comments now by then this you've probably said hey man so we don't leave comments anymore that's a good thing that's another thing we don't have to maintain our unit tests are going to be our form of documentation to explain how our application of all's our code structure should be clean and concise and follow standards and there's no reason for those blocks of codes you know comments for what a function does our variable is should be nut should be should be far and few between because we're going to name our variables properly and we're going to name our functions properly so that they're descriptive and and and show us what our code is doing instead of us talking us through comments typically are used as they're redundant and they're you know they're used to tell you what you can already see but worst of all they are a crutch for bad code and so we're gonna make our code better so we don't need comments if you've never heard the solid acronym you're not familiar with it don't worry bring it you caught up to speed so what are these solid principles well as I mentioned it is an acronym and the S stands for the single responsibility principle the oh is for the openclosed principle the L is the Liskov substitution principle the I which is one of my more favorite principles of the solid principles is the interface segregation principle and finally we have the dependency inversion principle so there's a lot bit lot of principles going on here five right so somewhat intertwined some of them all of them are important and we're gonna dive into a little bit about the history of the solid principles so where or who rather did these principles come from where did solid come from right because these things don't just come from nowhere and they came from Robert C Martin who you might more affectionately know him as Uncle Bob who is the author of clean code the clean coder and clean architecture which if you haven't read the clean code the clean code regardless of what skill level you're at whether you're a super senior or you just got started today I highly recommend those books and clean architecture I recommend as well but I think you should wait till you probably have at least a junior level role and there's links for all that in the description below if you're interested but with that being said he introduced it in a paper in 2000 about almost 20 years ago on the design principles and design patterns and that is really what the solid principles are there are ways for us to write our code and deliver some things and we're going to talk about why we should write our code in such ways so that they support certain development practices now he's also the coauthor of the agile manifesto and you might be saying well why is that relevant well because that's part of the solid principles goals you know if you've been working in software development for the last 10 years or so well you've probably seen is that the waterfall software development life cycles are dry and agile is a flowing river if you will and so that is what we're trying to accomplish with the solid principles is in general I would say that they are designed for objectoriented programming but that you can use them with other like functional stuff but it's most performance not the right word but I'd say it aligns best with objectoriented programming I would also say that it's language agnostic this isn't something that you just do for Java this isn't just something that you do for JavaScript or C sharp or you know your language of choice go whatever Russ whatever it is and that's one of the great things about it and it also sports agile so as I mentioned agile is sort of the way of the of software development nowadays and because of that it because of that rapid development lifecycle that you know if you're you're doing scrum you have two week iterations where you're delivering features every two weeks right you know we have you know some places are doing continuous integration and continuous deployment mean when it goes out it's out like it goes straight to master and so we need to make sure that our architecture is great and we need to make sure that the testing and the testdriven development processes are followed and the solid principles help us to do that so why does it help us do that well it help us accomplish a couple things it helps our code to be more understandable or readable it helps it to be easier to maintain and it allows it to be flexible so the strengths of the solid principles is it abstracts some things so it's so when changes happen it's it's much more flexible to get them to work and it allows us to extend things instead of instead of breaking things and having to rewrite things and so that it's much easier to add something than to have to rewrite an entire thing and that's one of the strengths of solid principles and it accomplishes these three things through the the five principles alright so let's go ahead and dive in a little bit to each one of these principles so just to get a highlevel overview of what they're trying to accomplish so the single responsibility principle favorites the famous quote a class should have one and only one reason to change so this is about good Google good organization of your code and understanding you know how good inheritance works and understanding how to write our code in such a way that things are bitesized to a degree and are not going to have more than it should write a a will give some code examples but there's a lot of and we've talked about this in other clean code series where you don't really want to pass boolean sin to tell it to do one thing or another for instance that could depending on this situation change the the logic that's happening not if something should happen but it's like hey do it if is this person don't or do it if this this other customer type that would might might be something where now we have multiple responsibilities in a single class we don't want to do stuff like that because it makes it much harder down the road to follow the logic to follow the code but it's all about keeping things in to the barebones minimum that a certain object should do and enforcing that with the single responsibility principle so we after the s comes the Oh open/close principles you should be able to extend a class behavior without modifying it so this goes to my earlier statements about we want to extend functionality we don't want to modify functionality and you know in a principles are in a perfect world I sometimes requirements don't come through and sometimes this is impossible but this is the general idea these are what we are trying to follow in a perfect world and so another item about this is you want to be able to if you're if you're following proper inheritance you should be able to swap in different versions of different services and items like that so you can extend maybe an interface that we'll go into in for your service or items like that and the open closed principle is refers to that it'll make a little bit more senseless code I did a very important job of explaining that but essentially we want to extend items without changing the code base right so if we're adding a new feature in theory we shouldn't really need to modify the previous code and if we have our if we have written our code in such a way we're going to we're going to add upon it instead of modifying what we already have the Liskov substitution principle and I don't know too much about the gentleman named Liskov but he had some good insight here so uh most of these principles are not necessarily Uncle Bob's ideas but ideas that he has used and and catered and somewhat tweaked and over the last 20 years or so put out there too and that's sort of his goal to get people software developers to write them and let's guy was just one of the many people along the way that have you know he has learned from I suppose this what I'm trying to say so with that being said derived classes must be substitutable for their base class so in any good objectoriented programming language you usually have a base class that you can extend to your child class a an example of this an excellent example on Stack Overflow for you to look this up is a square class extending from from rectangle so the the reason that this wouldn't you wouldn't be able to subset swap to essentially swap the base with their derived classes it's because function differently right at first thought it may it may seem that yeah you know what why wouldn't they why wouldn't want to inherit from the other right every square is a rectangle but not every rectangle is a square and that should be your hint right there because if you can't swap them out then there's something going on wrong here and you might want to rethink your approach right because let's say a you change usually in rectangle or in in a perfect square you always want the length and height to be the same so there might be logic in there that would handle that but that's not necessarily the case for a rectangle so you wouldn't necessarily swap them or inherit from from one and so those are the types of things you want to think about because there's probably a better approach than inheriting from a classes so that's what the Liskov substitution principle derived classes must be you must be able to substitute them for their base level classes so the interface segregation principle one of my favorite principles I like a lot of them but the clients should not be forced depend on methods that they do not use at first glance this this quote I could probably could show some better quote but the idea here is that you don't want to couple the code so tightly that you can't make a change without making changes in multiple places and so to help facilitate that we add a level of abstraction which we do through interfaces and this allows us to do a lot of things once it allows us to easily overwrite code if we need to right so like a common use that I use the interface segregation principle for is testing right so sometimes when you're testing on the front end you might inject an interface and it's going to that your service extends and then you can maybe mock it out or expect different things or override it there's a whole bunch of different things that you can do with that but the interface segregation principle is key to that because if we were passing in hard the hard code it's not hardcoded but the actual service call itself it'd be very difficult and probably actually it actually hit the API so we don't want that either but we'll dive more into that but the idea here is that couple twofold one that you should have a layer of abstraction and two that you shouldn't force people to use things that then makes it so tightly coupled that they they that you can't override it and that's the idea here with the interface segregation principle now if you haven't noticed by now I've said the word abstraction about 15 times and in the dependency inversion principle that will continue on so highlevel modules should not depend on low level modules both should depend upon abstractions this goes back to depending on not necessarily interfaces although you will but it depends on instead of having your actual code depend on other aspects of your code what you want or to have those abstraction layers is that you code in there and that allows a lot of flexibility especially when it comes to testing and mocking things out and so the dependency inversion principle helps support that as well today we're gonna be talking about the first letter of the solid acronym the S the single responsibility principle I'll be your host as always still in Israel so what exactly is the idea behind the single responsibility principle well it states that every software module should have one and only one reason to change now what does that actually mean it means that we're gonna have smaller classes we're gonna have single responsibility classes and this is gonna allow us to limit the impact of change so you know what does this actually mean so this is a quote from Uncle Bob who is a very big proponent of solid principles essentially the Creator gather together the things that change for the same reason separate those things that change for different reason so what I take that to mean is we're gonna have Kohi where it matters and we're in a decouple our code where it doesn't matter now most people focus only on making things as small as a as possible to automatize things to such a degree because that's more so the issue more so people have things that are just too big but you can also go in the opposite direction you make things to minut and too small and but that oftentimes doesn't get any attention but I wanted to bring that up because that is an issue in itself so let's go ahead and I want to share this link actually real quick before we jump into the code but this is a this is a link to Uncle Bob's blog where you can read more about the single responsibility principle here and I think it's really helpful so go ahead and check that out I'll put it in the description below as well but let's go ahead and see an implementation example of how we might use the single responsibility principle all right so let's take a very simple example here of how we are not using the single responsibility principle and how we can go ahead and use it to make it better so I'm doing this in typescript you can just think of it as JavaScript for the most part now everyone should be somewhat familiar with the cash register right we have ways you know they charge tax that keeps track of our totals you know there's a subtotal typically Annegret the grand total which is your subtotal plus tax and fees so a very simple example here and we have a function called calculate total all calculate total does is we have it updates our grand total so it gets the total wit tax and then we email a receipt to to the client say hey thank you for your business your total was you know one hundred one hundred dollars if you're balling hard and you buy like groceries or something so you might be saying why is this breaking the single responsibility principle well should this email private email receipt actually be sending anything in reality and mind you it's an empty that or should the cash archer be worried about having logic to email or receipt and the answer is no it shouldn't what what should happen here is that there should probably be an email class or message class that handles this that we then instantiate that class and have it go there and the reason for that is it takes it's still going to send an email right because our mail class is going to handle that logic but that's really where it should live right and that way if we change our code down the road we're you know what we need to update how we email clients customers it's all in one central location and we now we now have a single reason to change right before we had two reasons we had well if the total changes you know if the cash register code changes and great we have it's right here but also if you want to change how we email customers and clients we have to go into every class that we had this email logic and we then have to modify it well instead if we have a central class that handled that we can go ahead and and do exactly that in one central location so it makes our code a little bit smaller and puts it in different files so how might we fix this well pretty straightforward right we go ahead and create a new what's a let's just call it email email class TS you can go ahead and export a class here and then here what we're gonna call this email and email is going to have a message and note shall we before we had to send receipt this is a more of a generic class where maybe it's going to be something like send message right so we'd have a public send message and in our example it just took in a message this would be a strength and this would go and email you know let's just say we pretend that we have something to say email console.log the message whatever our lard logic here does it doesn't it doesn't really matter and then we could simply go ahead and take what's here and we're going to create a in the constructor we can create a property here you know we'll call this public email equals new or public cotton maybe mail would be a good name public you know some new equals a new email you know just go ahead and import it from there oh you don't be better actually let's just make that a static method right because are we really ever gonna create multiple versions of it this is a little bit more of objectoriented well this is going to be a static send message and now this is gonna do the same thing every time right similar if you're not familiar of static it essentially means that this is a property or a function on a class that you can use you can import it once and use it and it's not going to be something that you're ever going to necessarily redo so here we have email dot send message our static method and we'll go ahead and just pass that message like so and we can delete this logic here and now we've set it up so that it has one reason to change we're still sending an email with the receipt but our cash register the only reason our cash register changes is this something regarding the cash register domain changes well now that we have this email class if anything in our email class changes then it will auto update if in our right anywhere else were used in that class because it has a single purpose now and so that's really what what the single responsibility principle is trying to instill a good rule of thumb when you're trying to decide what's what is if you find yourself having to put an ore ore into your variable names and function names you oftentimes will see that you probably don't have things broken down enough and because of that you're gonna you're probably breaking the single responsibility principle a good way to to also help and sometimes developers will find themselves in this developers aren't used to like maybe objectoriented programming will find themselves into a situation where they start doing like boolean flags that's another example a lot of times of not always but where you might so perhaps extending a class or using some inheritance you might be having using a boolean flag to change between two pieces of logic that do two completely different things that's another sort of gotcha to watch out for when using the single responsibility principle we're now on the openclosed principle let's go ahead and jump right in so what is the general idea for the openclosed principle well you've probably heard this if you've ever heard of the openclosed principle many many times but software should be open for extension but closed for modification I'm usually software very generally we're talking about classes we're talking about modules pretty much any anything any aspect of software that's reusable we want to make it open to expand upon but close to modify that original level of code so what does that really mean well what it means is and this is my interpretation but essentially means we want to extend the code so that we don't have to refactor legacy code legacy code bean code that was there before we started writing our code before we started expanding upon this and this is especially helpful not necessarily in greenfield development but when you are adding new features to code or refactoring code so what does this actually mean right what it actually means is the successful use of inheritance properly you know how we can extend things using inheritance makes it a lot gives us some flexibility to make our code more wait for it solid and it allows us to change our code easier and allowed these changes to occur easier easily rather so that we don't have to worry about it breaking and it being an issue to jump into the code we have to we don't have to update it in multiple spots that's this last note here is a wellwritten class should not have to be updated in multiple spots now again these are principles these are not the endall beall there's always exceptions to the rules or exceptions to the principles but these are the general things that it will actually allow us to do so let's go ahead and just make a quick note saude principles are a lot of people have preached about them but one person in particular is Uncle Bob or Robert Martin as you might know him and his blog post here goes into greater detail on the openclosed principle and I'd highly encourage you to check it out just to have a you know multiple interpretations of it I'm gonna give you my interpretation of it and you can get someone who's much more familiar with it than myself because it's been preaching about it for about 1520 years but that's a lot of words let's go ahead and give a live example now let's jump back into our previous example with the cash register you'll notice here that I've added a constructor that's going to take a balance and we're going to it's going to be a number of the balance of the drawer essentially and so a bad example of how we would be modifying our code is exactly like this right and so we might have a balance property here and we're gonna sign that to a number and it's somewhat relevant right so we're gonna say like this dot balance equal to the balance that comes in but now what's happening sir we're actually modifying the original code and this will happen again and again as we continue to expand upon our cash register example but you may be saying like Dylann well shouldn't the balance be part of the cash register and isn't gonna need you know subtotal tax rate maybe the grand total because we may have to you know find out if we have enough cash in the drawer but by modifying this we're now adding complexity to the cash register that may be what we really need to do is to find a drawer class that extends the cash register that inherits from that and that's where the balance list because it's sort of new functionality that we can actually make it a little bit more a little bit of a smaller class while still having access to that so let's go ahead and do that because that's gonna show an example here we showed an example of what we don't want to do we wanted to be close to modification well how would we make this open for extension all right and to do that let's go ahead and just create a little file here and we'll call this drawer cash drawer if we want and what we're gonna do here is we're going to export this class here I guess we don't technically have to export it but I'll call it our cash drawer cash dryer drawer I don't know someone will correct me in the comments I have no doubt and in our constructor here we'll go ahead and essentially do the same thing that we did it's gonna be a number and we'll go ahead and have a property here public balance like the number and then we'll set it just start number is equal to balance oh this top balance excuse me they stopped balance sequel to balance cool and now I'll just go ahead and take this out of here because we don't want that in there because that would be extending it but here we just need to extend our original cash register and when we're doing at least in type shape when we're extending a class we need to call super which is just essentially saying that this is a child or being extended from our cash register which is the parent here and now although we have all the access to subtotal tax rate calculate total but it has its own draw we have our own drawer here where maybe we need to use some of those properties later on we will we could have access to that we can reference them here and not have any issues and we've successfully been able to extend the cash register class without actually modifying it so open for extension closed for modification now this is just one example and a very simple one at that but these are the sorts of things that you need to think about as you're developing code right what separates a junior developer from a senior developer is the ability to not only make the code run but both of you will have your code running but having something that is going to last the tests of time the best our ability be easy and maintainable and testable and allows change in a much more simplistic fashion so that's the open closed principle today we're going to be diving into the Liskov substitution principle our third or fourth video on the solid principles as we're working our way through and this one's a little bit of a doozy you know if for a lack of a better word so I'm gonna give you the very computerscience heavy and if you're if you've ever gone and pursued a bachelor's in computer science or really looked into the fundamentals of it this wording will seem very similar because a lot of these principles are worded in such a way the idea from that stance is if s is a subtype of T then objects of T maybe replaced with objects of s without altering altering any of the desirable properties of the program so this reminds me of college quite a bit and it's it's a little bit confusing right it's even for people who write software professionally there's probably a better way of explaining the concept that we can do that so what does this actually mean well what it essentially means is that subtypes should retain the behavior of the main type now we're talking about inheritance you know an easy way of playing that is children should be like their parents for what they inherit you know if you are overriding the properties of the parent then probably what should happen is you might want to rethink how you are abstracting your code and how you are inheriting your code and the structure that because you might have something wrong because it may not be a child right and a basic example is if I'm a human April is a human and that is our type and we have children and it's a duck something went wrong because we should not be able to have a duck you know it could still have a name property it could still have an age right but it definitely should not be a duck should probably be a human child no it definitely should be a human child we have to rethink it so the common thing that happens is you know that that's what that actually means and you know the way that most people explain this to you is that if you cannot substitute a child class for its parent class in your code still be functional then that means that you broke something that that class is inheriting because all your child class is doing it is should be extending the behavior it should not be altering the behavior of a parent class right and so with that being said let's go ahead and jump into an implementation of this because it's a little computer science heavy but you know we'll give a good example as with all things software stack overflow this is excellent example I think that really hammers the Liskov substitution principle down so let's take a look at the code here we all have a rectangle class a rectangle has a height and a width they are independent of one another right the height can be any value and the width can be any value any positive value I should say and when we set the height with a method and we set the width all it's doing is saying the height in the width now one thing that people suffer with and one thing that people get wrong about objectoriented programming is they oftentimes say that it models reallife that is a fallacy that is somebody who wants it to make sense but you are building you were taking the abstract and making it concrete you're not taking the concrete and making it abstract is how I kind of think of it and although there are similarities is not always the case when it comes to code and this is a great example as Y so we have our rectangle class and our square class as well which extends rectangle it inherits from it is a child of our square claw of our rectangle class and the issue here is is when dealing with a square and a perfect square your height and width are going to be the same thing and you'll see here we set the height it's gonna set the height and the width we set the width it's gonna set the width and the height and now what ends up happening is anywhere we actually want to use this rectangle class we are going to if we were to swap the child with the parent it no longer would be an accurate representation of what it is we're trying to accomplish and because the parent class here cannot be substituted although a rectangle it can still be a perfect square it defeats all other rectangles right it's not that it's impractical it's not that it doesn't really from a logical standpoint makes sense that hey let's extend rectangle for our square because you know it is that is makes sense mathematically but the Akala t of it is is that's going to break the substitution principle and cause issues down the road because we should be able based off the principle pass in the child for the parent without any additional setbacks so how might we how might we solve this issue if we wanted to extend rectangle well the honest answer is one you could remove it entirely which we could do here the other answer is we could maybe reorganize our code so that we have a shape class and so perhaps we would this is just me sort of free balling it but perhaps we create a new file called shape I'm gonna export class shape and in here we might have a public type you can go ahead and make that a string and that would maybe be enough if we wanted some similarities probably not what I would prefer to do but perhaps all shapes will have a height and a width and in here this also be a number and from this will have rectangle we got that out that extends shape and we will have square that extends shape and now we have a class that if we were to swap it in now it'd be fine now granted it's a very basic class and we don't even need type in this current iteration but here if we were to swap either one for the parent class we shouldn't have any issue right we're not gonna override height and width are still gonna be numbers take out the time and that's all we're really checking for here there aren't gonna be any sideeffects but in our previous example we would have just fine by extending upon a rectangle because we can't substitute for them hence the substitution principle the Liskov substitution crystals will harder ones in my opinion because you you almost have to be you have to have very realworld working examples before you sort of run into this issue we're going to be talking about the interface segregation principle in this episode of code like a pro the fourth principle of the solid principles so what is the idea well the idea is to not force the client the client could be people consuming your your class or your object or other developers right so that could be third party in house but to make it so that they are not forced to depend on methods they do not use that's the idea so what does that actually mean well it supports the what we've sort of been talking about with smaller classes or interfaces this idea of role interfaces which is essentially breaking out into the smaller classes and interfaces that should be defined and we'll give an example of that and this supports abstraction because as a application continues to grow we're gonna start having these issues where I have to make one change in here and one change in there and one change over here to do this one change and so if we start following the solid principles and the interface segregation principle that abstraction will allow us to make those change in a much easier manner without having a lot of sideeffects which is something we want to avoid so how do we do it well let's go ahead and give an example so let's take this very large interface here and typically a large interfaces or large classes indicative of a very complex object they have to say is this object does this object need to be that complex does it really handle this is that is this everything you want to be so so just sort of a red flag but you'll see here we have our vehicle interface just defining what our vehicle class would be right we have a get speed that returns a number a good vehicle type which is gonna be a string you know some some financing things you know as tax paid are the lights on have we started the engine have we accelerated and we stopped the engine a start radio how we function do we want to play a CD do we want to stop the radio so we have all these sorts of various properties of what a car or a vehicle might have and looking at this this is gonna cost us a lot of problems where every time we modify the vehicle class for any aspect whether it's the engine or the music or the lights whatever it may be we're gonna run in these issues where we are treating this vehicle object as one and the same and and the rowdy of the situation is that's not necessarily true so how might we go ahead and fix this well let's do a little bit of refactoring here where instead of just the IV achill we can have maybe in highlights right so let's at defining interface here called eye light and I in type scripts you typically denote an interface with an eye oftentimes I I'll build a abstract class because interfaces are just sort of ain't and you can do a little bit some more complex interfaces stuff but um I don't want to get too much into typescript but if we have lights why wouldn't we have it is lights on and have that over here and it'll be the same thing right you're just returning a boolean so you go ahead and take that out and it is lights off excellent and we could do another thing where let's go ahead and create a radio interface right because we're playing with the music radio and we would have our start stop and play CD that's all of our radio object and then of our I engine right so let's see here we have start engine accelerate that all looks like to be an engine go ahead and do something this interface alright excellent and so now you'll see that we've sort of broken this out a little bit more and we can reuse these as needed and if we needed to let's go ahead and actually say we had a vehicle class and we wanted to consume these things right the vehicle class is going to extend a vehicle like so no expense there you know a few months didn't you save this is that why it's not finding it there we go so and you'll see here that we need to implement some functions right we want to implement the get speed that get vehicle type is tax play so we can go ahead and define public get speed and I'll do something you know we're gonna say public is tax payable all right here for the time being I'm just filling this out real quick so we return that just return to one something like that and we have two more implementations and then we're gonna actually use the other interfaces in a second here so that we can consume those in a more responsible manner if we felt that we needed to do that right so turn this just an empty string here for time being well this is just a property excuse me just for the sake of time we'll go ahead and make that a function and then go ahead and throw that on there as well and we'll just return truth all right so now we've been able to actually implement that in our vehicle class but we might have other things that we want as well where maybe we have a radio of type I radio we have to export these as well but and then we'll go and we'll assign whatever properties to sorry I'd probably have a class in reality but what this gives us the ability to now is that all our radio logic is now separated out over here we have our various interfaces and we can use them and it's all broken out to what it needs to be right and we've now separated out piece by piece so we don't have to and abstracted it so that we don't have to rely on this a massive vehicle interface or class for that matter so you know it's it's a lot of these principles will sort of fall into that hole that each sort of touch each other like some of this may feel very similar single or responsibility principle and some of you may be saying like well why am i importing you know why am i importing radio into the vehicle class well you have to understand let's say we want to let's say one of our developers wanted to use just a radio right they had a need for a radio class and we wanted to follow that if it wasn't broken out like this they would then be forced to install the vehicle class just to use the radio so what we're doing is we're gonna have strapped it break it down a little bit so that you only care about the pieces that affect your development that affects your code and it's for a good objectoriented principles so as always guys I hope you found helpful don't forget to comment like subscribe and share and look forward to our next video the dependency inversion principle which is by far one thing that I would say I found I didn't fully understand but is by far my favorite solid principle and I think has made my software my code writing taken to the next level so I really hope you take particular interest in the dependency inversion principle we are finishing up our section on these solid principles going to be talking about the dependency inversion principle my favorite principle of all five principles mainly because I I really do use it almost daily and I find that it to be one of the most helpful I didn't fully understand why but the more and more I've practiced the solid principles the dependency inversion principle has been a crucial one for me to maintain my code and make sure that it's clean and does what it needs to do so what is the idea you're gonna see if you if you're going to do a Google search on the dependency inversion principle you're gonna see something like this high level objects should not depend on the low level implementations or high level modules should not depend on low level modules something very similar then I say okay okay so what does that mean well three main things that kind of duplicated this but uh duplicated the first a second one we wanted to pin on a dependent on abstractions festival string along and abstraction should not depend on low level details and we just want to generally support abstracting our code now the dependency inversion principle is quite unique in the fact that there are several great ways that you can use this and we've talked and remember it relates to objectoriented programming the solid principles and in our code I'm gonna give you example how I use it almost every day by creating mocks for testing and making sure that it is the test mocks match our actual implementation that as our actual abstraction class so that everything is synced up and working well together so let's go ahead and dive into it so let's take a little bit of some angular code this is gonna be a mixture typescript and angular and what we're looking at is a service here so this service is gonna go and do some API call our service is called hacker news service and christen you know it's pretty pretty normal it's nothing out of the ordinary but it's not utilizing the dependency inversion principle which would have us abstract a interface to allow us to not only extend the extend this but make it so that other dependencies are dependent promise class R and so let's say we wanted to mock this file out for testing purposes because you know we already have our test make sure Hacker News Service is doing what it needs to do but we don't necessarily want to actually use the actual implementation and make those API calls obviously so we're gonna have a mock class but there's nothing tying these two together at the very least we can tie them together and make sure that we don't have an issue with our mock not matching what it's supposed to be so how might we solve it well if you had a interface in this click in this case we're using an abstract class was the same idea but if we had a interface to invert the dependencies so that we don't really care about the lowlevel dependencies in low level low level in this aspect it's actual implementation of the mock the implementation of the actual service and instead we're just going to define the actual class itself like so what we're gonna do is we're going to take this and we're going to extend the I hacker new service which is fine was the issue here no this is just some tighter stuff actually ringy's implement so I have to say same same thing more or less and so now we're saying ok cool we actually understand that it has all everything it needs for AI hacker service and we might find out that our mock is doing it wrong it might be that there's an issue there so let's kind of implement I hack their new service and in this case still the future decorator but I thought this is gonna blow up but didn't but now both of these are extending the correct dependency it is extending the abstract class or the interface now in typescript we have a way of injecting the interface and that would be how we would actually consume this is we will inject the interface into the class and then depending upon our dependency injection method and angular you have modules to handle that it would inject your actual surface itself it's service itself while providing the the interface let's go ahead and let me show you some code of where you might do something like that so here we're looking at the module which is how angular handles its dependency injection or hat handles it's managing of dependencies might be a better way of saying that and you'll see that we are providing the abstract class that doesn't do anything but it is there to say this is what is expected of our service this is what our service should be doing we don't really care how it does it just as long as you meet the requirements and then when we actually go and want to have the actual instantiation of that extra class which is the actual surface itself use this class use that class and then if we had like a component if we were to do a component comp component yes and we want to X at now it's getting a little angular 3 but if we had a component like so that's supposed to be component and we want to export whatever X for class something in the constructor the dependency we inject is the actual interface and then it's just gonna go and pull that class because we've inverted error dependencies we may share dependency injections on that that's just a little more of how you might actually use it but you get the general idea is that if you're gonna have something mocking a service or you're gonna what you will and you want to have a highlevel object maintained what everything does if you won't think of that way and then extend that out or implement it out and that's that that's a very realistic I am that I use quite often for the dependency inversion principle putting out guys we found that helpful as always don't forget to comment like subscribe share all that good stuff if you're interesting in my courses I highly recommend the 100 I'll give them a challenge help you ace your next technical interview there's a link in the description below gate just for 10 bucks I'll see you
