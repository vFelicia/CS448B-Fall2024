00:05 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:07 - Jessie I'm Jessie and today we were
00:10 - going to do some work with jQuery it's
00:13 - been a while since we've done anything
00:14 - with jQuery but I built a single page
00:18 - application 2016 I worked on it for on
00:23 - and off for the majority of 2016 I think
00:27 - I launched it in October September
00:30 - something like that yeah it had to have
00:34 - been October I think I launched it right
00:37 - around when my youngest daughter was
00:40 - born so she was born at the beginning of
00:43 - October hey everyone
00:46 - see a lot of you the live chat so before
00:51 - we do that I have a few things I want to
00:54 - talk about I'm gonna try to keep it
00:55 - quick and then we can talk more about it
00:57 - later on when we do the question and
01:00 - answer session so first thing is
01:02 - something cool I found this in my
01:06 - basement and this is like my first phone
01:11 - the first one I ever had so it's one of
01:15 - these old Nokia phones with like the
01:20 - clear case that I thought was so awesome
01:22 - I mean it I still think it's awesome you
01:25 - see all the insides and the buttons are
01:29 - worn down you can't see the numbers on
01:31 - some of them so anyway I'm gonna add
01:33 - this to my antique collection which you
01:36 - all can't see so up here so this is my
01:40 - antique collection up here I just have a
01:43 - bunch of like floppy disk beta tapes the
01:48 - copy of Windows XP and I you can't see
01:52 - it but I have an old like CRT like
01:56 - television with a VCR and it so so
02:00 - that's going to be added to the
02:02 - collection and I'm gonna see if I can
02:07 - find a cord that will charge that and
02:09 - I'll get back on it
02:10 - maybe I can look at all my old text
02:12 - messages and see what I was saying when
02:16 - I was a teenager maybe I'll play some
02:18 - snake y'all remember snake all right so
02:24 - that was that was something fun now
02:28 - something serious and then I want to
02:30 - talk about a project that I'm working on
02:32 - and see if anyone's interested in being
02:34 - involved so something serious I know
02:37 - I've talked on the stream before about
02:39 - mental health issues with myself having
02:43 - depression so I just want to like fill
02:48 - you in on what I've been doing and I've
02:51 - been in a much better mood recently so
02:53 - as you may or may not know from previous
02:55 - streams I am going to counseling every
02:57 - month I'm on in two different
03:00 - antidepressants so I'm doing you know
03:04 - basically medically what I should be
03:06 - doing but then in addition to that this
03:09 - is now the tenth day in a row that I
03:11 - have got up early before work and
03:14 - exercise
03:15 - so nothing intense I just go on an
03:18 - exercise bike while I play Zelda on my
03:22 - Nintendo switch and I just go for like
03:26 - half hour 45 minutes just as long as I
03:30 - can before the kids wake up and and then
03:33 - afterwards I may do some push-ups or
03:35 - sit-ups if I have time and do a little
03:38 - stretching and I'm not super tired
03:43 - during the day I mean I stay caffeinated
03:45 - right so but I'm not really tired from
03:50 - waking up like this morning I got up at
03:52 - 4:45 a.m. and I feel fine right now so
03:56 - anyway I just want to share that with
03:58 - you all I know it's pretty common
04:01 - knowledge that exercise helps with your
04:03 - mood and with depression but sometimes
04:06 - it just takes a little push to get going
04:08 - so this is kind of my little push to say
04:11 - hey I've been doing enough for 10 days I
04:14 - feel a whole lot better it was really
04:16 - really hard at first to get out of bed
04:19 - but now that I got into a rhythm I'm
04:22 - waking up early before my alarm
04:24 - the key also is getting the bed on time
04:27 - so I've been taking melatonin at night
04:30 - so that I can go to sleep early enough
04:33 - to make that possible I'm still not
04:35 - sleeping like a lot like seven hours or
04:38 - so like give or take a half hour but you
04:44 - know if I can get eight that's awesome
04:46 - too but anyway so that's just decide
04:50 - bring that up I haven't really talked
04:51 - about mental health issues on the stream
04:53 - for a while and I know you know some of
04:56 - you may be dealing with the same things
04:59 - it's pretty common so just just want to
05:02 - talk about if anyone wants to talk more
05:03 - about that either in the chat or
05:05 - privately you know feel free to reach
05:08 - out to me I've been dealing with it for
05:10 - a long time and sometimes it does help
05:13 - to be able to talk to somebody who's
05:14 - going through the same thing alright so
05:18 - last thing before we get started with
05:20 - the code as you all know if you've been
05:25 - watching the last few streams I
05:27 - purchased the domain name JavaScript AF
05:30 - and we have a forum running on there now
05:34 - that Harshit set up which is awesome
05:36 - thank you harsh it right now
05:39 - it was down because we were trying to
05:43 - transfer it from harsh it's digitalocean
05:45 - account to mine and took a snapshot try
05:51 - to transfer it didn't work so he just
05:53 - sent me another snapshot and we're gonna
05:58 - try to get that up and running so okay I
06:01 - see this hard should I see the snapshot
06:03 - now thank you I guess I'll just get that
06:05 - up and running after the stream so we're
06:09 - going to try to get that up so if you're
06:12 - trying to get to the forum don't worry
06:14 - it's we're working on it it should be up
06:17 - soon after the stream but I've had so
06:24 - javascript err so you can see job it's
06:27 - in the live chat right now Jay
06:29 - s-see RP or JV SC rptr so I'm just gonna
06:37 - say JavaScript I reached out to me on
06:41 - Instagram and had an idea for a website
06:48 - where developers can connect with
06:50 - developers and it would be like like a
06:53 - social media platform but you'd login
06:56 - with your github profile and it could
06:58 - you could voluntarily have a pool data
07:01 - from your github and mix that in so I I
07:08 - kind of envisioned it and and JavaScript
07:11 - you can let you know you know more
07:14 - details as well in terms of like the UI
07:18 - and things and what's going on but the
07:24 - way I envisioned it is it's gonna be
07:28 - place pretty much just for developers
07:30 - right you have to at least have a github
07:31 - account to get in so if if you don't
07:35 - remember Facebook when it first started
07:38 - around like 2004 somewhere around there
07:42 - you had to have a university email and
07:45 - at first like you had to have your
07:47 - university signed up to get an email not
07:49 - not every university was even allowed
07:51 - yet so it was like this niche and it was
07:56 - kind of cool you you had this thing in
07:58 - common so trying to go for that vibe of
08:02 - you know this is a place just for a
08:04 - certain niche so it's it's not we're not
08:07 - trying to recreate Facebook here or
08:09 - Twitter or anything like that they all
08:11 - serve their purpose and what we're
08:14 - trying to do here is just have a place
08:16 - more geared toward developers so the
08:18 - features would be developers for
08:20 - developers for instance like all the
08:22 - github info I think it would be cool I
08:25 - had another suggestion for someone on
08:27 - Twitter and I'm really sorry I can't
08:29 - remember who it was right now but
08:31 - another suggestion was to feature really
08:34 - awesome JavaScript projects from the
08:36 - community so I think that's another
08:39 - thing that we could work in so that made
08:42 - when you go there it's not all about
08:43 - it's not just all about your feed like
08:46 - Facebook or Twitter is there's also like
08:49 - some highlights from the community of
08:52 - really cool things going on maybe some
08:54 - sort of like voting mechanism to be able
08:56 - to see what's what's going in there and
08:58 - and I would I kind of want to exclude
09:00 - like the really big projects everybody
09:03 - knows reacts a big deal you know so we
09:06 - wouldn't want to feature that because
09:07 - I'm sure it would be on top all the time
09:09 - right when you go to look at like github
09:12 - like top projects it's always a lot of
09:15 - the same really big ones so I would kind
09:17 - of want to feature like some more
09:19 - unknown things that are really cool like
09:21 - people doing like VR with JavaScript
09:23 - machine learning like no bus cool stuff
09:26 - so anyway we don't need to have all the
09:33 - features ready right away of course
09:35 - right but the basic features that we'd
09:38 - like to have are you know obviously this
09:41 - is going to be built with react because
09:42 - that's that's what we've been into new
09:45 - most often in terms of back-end I'm kind
09:49 - of thinking maybe firebase would be a
09:51 - good fit for authentication and things
09:55 - like that so I don't know let me know
09:58 - what you all think so while you're
10:00 - watching the rest of the stream before
10:02 - we get to the question answer session
10:03 - just think about this think if it's
10:06 - maybe something that you'd like to be
10:08 - involved in in some way or you know what
10:13 - are your ideas in terms of technology
10:15 - was what would work best to have
10:18 - something like this where users sign in
10:20 - with their github obviously they're
10:22 - going to need to be data to stored
10:23 - images stored these things so it if
10:27 - you're familiar with firebase let me
10:29 - know if I'm on the right track here in
10:30 - firebase would be a good fit so
10:39 - I yeah I don't know so this is it's
10:42 - still very open in terms of like
10:44 - architecture like what's what we're
10:47 - gonna already use so I mean something
10:50 - like firebase just comes with so many
10:52 - things built in to help us expand so
10:55 - that's why I'm kind of mentioning that
10:56 - but I haven't worked with it personally
10:58 - I've just kind of watched videos on it
10:59 - all right so anyway right now JavaScript
11:05 - er is working on UI stuff so basically
11:07 - just making kind of an interactive
11:09 - prototype with just straight HTML like
11:13 - CSS stuff well eventually once we get
11:16 - that to where like we like it we can
11:19 - convert it to react components so that's
11:24 - that's where we're going now
11:26 - javascript ER has a repo for the UI up
11:30 - now so I guess we could share info about
11:34 - that I'll maybe I'll get a repo going
11:39 - for like the react version of it and so
11:43 - we could have like one official place we
11:46 - can maybe do some have some issues ready
11:48 - if you want to help with it so I am I'm
11:53 - going to kind of stop the conversation
11:54 - on it now so we can get to the get to
11:58 - the code but then we'll pick up with it
12:01 - and you know so feel free to type
12:04 - whatever you think about this project
12:06 - and please be honest if you think it's a
12:08 - terrible idea let me know if you if you
12:10 - have ideas for features or whatever
12:12 - please let me know and we can discuss it
12:15 - in the question answer session I'm
12:19 - probably not going to talk about it all
12:21 - the time on the stream for two reasons
12:23 - one this is free code camp stream we
12:27 - mainly deal with nonprofits this could
12:29 - eventually end up being a for-profit
12:31 - thing if it's big I could see maybe
12:35 - companies wanting to advertise jobs I
12:37 - wouldn't want it to get crazy like a lot
12:41 - of social media now there's so many
12:42 - sponsored posts and things I don't want
12:43 - it to be like that but you know
12:46 - potentially there could be something
12:47 - like some something at some point so I
12:51 - don't want to bring that into the
12:53 - we can't Channel also I am streaming
12:55 - from work and I'd like to work on my
12:57 - work project so I don't want to spend a
13:00 - lot of my work time doing this so if you
13:04 - have questions please feel free to ask
13:05 - me I'll take a minute or two in the live
13:07 - chat everyday to talk if you have a
13:09 - question otherwise just you know send me
13:12 - a message on any of the social media
13:13 - things or whatever and we can kind of
13:15 - organize this and and get this going
13:18 - okay
13:22 - also javascript is in the live chat now
13:24 - so if you want to keep the conversation
13:25 - going just send a message
13:29 - you know just tag JavaScript or in the
13:31 - live chat okay all right so let me
13:38 - introduce you to this old jQuery project
13:41 - that I that I built so I we we worked a
13:46 - little bit on a react version of this
13:48 - project this is the the bulletin right
13:50 - the university of oulu team that we had
13:53 - worked on and i did some updates to it
13:56 - yesterday i added so we had that email
14:00 - authentication where you could do the
14:01 - password list link sent to your email
14:04 - i've added another way to go into the
14:06 - app and we talked about this yesterday a
14:08 - bit where basically if you're able to
14:11 - log into the university single sign-on
14:13 - system and get to that password
14:15 - protected area and then you click the
14:17 - link from there you can get directly
14:20 - into the bulletin without having to go
14:22 - through the normal login process but the
14:26 - problem now is before we automatically
14:30 - had a user's email because they had to
14:31 - put their email in to login and so I had
14:34 - a form on there that a user could fill
14:36 - out and I didn't have an email field
14:38 - because we just grabbed the email
14:40 - automatically now we need to add an
14:42 - email field in and we need to change up
14:46 - a little bit about how we're sending
14:47 - that data to make sure that the emails
14:51 - are going where they they need to go so
14:54 - let's dig into there let's let's kind of
14:57 - like try to straighten out my spaghetti
14:59 - code jQuery this hopefully will be a
15:03 - good example of why you
15:05 - I really don't want to try to make a
15:06 - single-page app and handle routing and
15:08 - everything with jQuery because it starts
15:11 - out small and then you add new features
15:13 - in all the sudden there's a lot there so
15:18 - let's start out and let's run this so
15:21 - this is running on gulp so haven't used
15:24 - go up in a while I don't know how many
15:28 - of you remember using gulp or still use
15:30 - go I mean if I'm not doing the react
15:32 - projects I'd probably go with gulp or
15:35 - maybe just like NPM scripts or something
15:38 - but so I think it's gulp watch let's see
15:44 - oops let me bring my screen up here
15:48 - there we are
15:53 - yeah so I just did a gulp watch and this
16:00 - brought up our bulletin now I'm gonna
16:03 - have to login so here's the the normal
16:07 - login
16:18 - and this is done with a service called
16:21 - auth0
16:23 - so I'm just using the free plan for
16:26 - auth0
16:26 - the university is not very big so the
16:28 - free plan is sufficient and I'm sending
16:31 - the emails for the authentication
16:32 - through SendGrid
16:33 - so the free plan on Austria and SendGrid
16:36 - are kind of what's behind this current
16:38 - system eventually we'll get rid of this
16:42 - system when we switch over to the react
16:45 - version that heart should set up a
16:48 - password the system without the use of
16:52 - Ozzy row which is awesome so let me
16:57 - check my email now and get the code
17:00 - there we go
17:12 - that's great all right so now I'm in so
17:17 - what's happened is the user information
17:19 - is not saved in local storage in the
17:21 - browser so as long as I don't clear your
17:23 - local storage then this will stay login
17:29 - for a year at least that's the plan some
17:32 - users have been having issues where
17:34 - their local storage is getting cleared
17:36 - and there's no apparent reason why so
17:40 - that was the other day there yesterday
17:44 - or the day before or I think I had
17:46 - someone come in for some troubleshooting
17:49 - and that was exactly the issue they were
17:52 - getting logged out and we could not
17:55 - figure out why all right so let's go to
18:02 - this submit announcement form so this is
18:04 - what we're going to be changing we just
18:06 - need to add one more field and that's
18:08 - for email and we probably could now that
18:17 - I look at it you I was it might make
18:20 - more sense visually to move this file up
18:24 - load up here in this corner so we would
18:29 - have email the file upload and then the
18:32 - announcement full-width down here write
18:35 - the announcement generally tends to be a
18:36 - lot longer it wouldn't make sense that
18:39 - will fool with email except on on small
18:43 - screens all right so that's what we're
18:45 - that's what we're gonna do so let's
18:49 - check the code and let me just duplicate
18:54 - this tab and we're gonna go into visual
18:57 - studio code I don't think I have this
19:00 - open anywhere maybe I did oh well okay
19:06 - so this was our password we don't need
19:12 - this this is where I'm handling the
19:14 - login our app
19:19 - [Music]
19:20 - baliya so all the code is informs AAS
19:26 - now unfortunately this code is in a
19:29 - private repo so you won't be able to to
19:33 - follow along I just saw the live chat
19:35 - Harshit said has to go because something
19:38 - came up
19:39 - thanks so much are for for all your
19:42 - help with the forum earlier and
19:44 - hopefully everything's alright nikki has
19:51 - to go to see it thanks for watching
19:55 - let's I also should mention we had some
20:01 - more pool requests come in and we will
20:03 - go over that and review that probably
20:08 - tomorrow I'd like to get back to our
20:10 - main project that francisc and main
20:13 - website that we've been working on
20:15 - tomorrow and then continue to just work
20:18 - on that project until we launch it in
20:20 - February late February
20:24 - alright so let's check out what we have
20:26 - this controls the modal and we have
20:32 - different models that show up whether
20:33 - the message is successful or not we're
20:37 - also going to need to go to the index
20:39 - page so let me split this this screen so
20:47 - we can have the HTML on one place and I
20:54 - believe it's all the way at the bottom
20:55 - here
21:03 - here we are let me know if that font is
21:10 - too small so we can see we have this
21:15 - this text area for announcement what we
21:20 - want to do is make an input so I'm going
21:26 - to I'm gonna take this and copy it and
21:35 - we're gonna need yeah we're gonna need
21:43 - to rearrange this a bit but first how
21:47 - that indentation is crazy there we are
21:55 - so we're get definitely going to change
21:58 - this we don't want the the edit icon so
22:03 - let's see I'm not sure if there's an
22:07 - icon called email but it's worth a shot
22:10 - and we want to change this we obviously
22:12 - don't need a text area so let's change
22:15 - this to an input and we can give it a
22:17 - type of email we want to change the ID
22:27 - to email and he relies inputs I think
22:34 - that class will be fine and we want to
22:38 - change this to an input and the label
22:45 - now is going to be for email and we're
22:53 - going to change this to email all right
22:58 - so now we're pulling in email are we we
23:00 - have a field for email and let's bring
23:03 - up this file upload whoops and you know
23:06 - what I forgot to put this in its own
23:12 - I mess this up a bit alright let's bring
23:16 - this down here and let's put it in a div
23:20 - we are using materialized CSS so that's
23:25 - where these column classes are coming
23:27 - from class it's so weird to not type
23:33 - class name since we're used to doing
23:35 - react but we can use class and let's
23:40 - call let's make this a column and we
23:43 - want it to be in small screens we want
23:45 - to make it full width so 12 out of 12
23:47 - columns and then on medium screens and
23:49 - up we want it to be half the width so 6
23:54 - out of 12 columns and now we can paste
24:00 - in our new input and then we also want
24:06 - to bring in this file upload input so
24:14 - let's grab make sure it'll grab too much
24:19 - class for every checkbox okay I believe
24:23 - we have everything and we're gonna put
24:30 - this right here underneath and we're
24:35 - gonna also need to change our column
24:38 - classes as well so we had the column
24:44 - that was oops
24:51 - did I put this in the wrong spot I think
24:55 - I did
25:05 - let's move that okay
25:13 - now in the right spot so we just need to
25:16 - add on on medium screen so we want this
25:19 - to take up half the width all right now
25:24 - let's check out how this looks and then
25:26 - we can go back to our our code
25:30 - let's move this around so you don't want
25:34 - to go too far all right let's check this
25:38 - all right okay not not too bad
25:42 - so we have our email and you know what
25:46 - the this is not aligned correctly we
25:53 - have to check on this alignment why
25:54 - we're having an issue here but other
25:58 - than the alignment issue this looks fine
25:59 - I do want to make sure we're setting a
26:02 - good breakpoint here so let's see if at
26:05 - any point it looks too small I think
26:08 - it's fine I mean it's getting a little
26:10 - narrow there but that's that's still
26:14 - reasonable all right all right not bad
26:23 - let's see if we can figure out from the
26:26 - markup with this this issue is beat with
26:32 - the spacing with these icons and an easy
26:38 - fix if we can't figure it out would just
26:40 - be to remove the icons which I'm okay
26:45 - with doing that basically the reason
26:47 - being this is a really low level update
26:49 - that needs to happen so I am I'm not
26:56 - that worried about you whether or not
27:00 - there's an icon there all right
27:05 - so we have this row and everything is
27:12 - wrapped in one row okay call them class
27:19 - the field callers - okay it's a column
27:23 - you know what let's try to put though we
27:26 - do have this oops
27:29 - what did we do you know what I added
27:32 - another column there I did not even
27:35 - realize that I added an extra column
27:43 - alright so if anybody caught that and
27:46 - was really confused that's why I added
27:49 - an extra column where I didn't really
27:51 - need one
27:52 - let's check this up now hopefully that
27:55 - corrected it yep and that corrected it
27:57 - now these are lined up properly I'm not
28:04 - thrilled about how far up this is with
28:07 - the email but I'm willing to live with
28:09 - it right now whoa hahaha I didn't even
28:14 - notice this alright I probably just
28:16 - forgot an ending div here somewhere so
28:18 - let's check out our divs
28:21 - [Music]
28:24 - oops there we are I have too many divs
28:34 - here we are
28:39 - all right that's acceptable I'm honestly
28:44 - this is not the best-looking thing I've
28:46 - ever built but right now this needs to
28:50 - be done like today like this morning it
28:54 - needs to be done so I'm okay with it
28:57 - also the fact that we're going to
28:59 - replace this entire thing with something
29:01 - new
29:01 - sometime within the next six months like
29:05 - I'm alright with with this this is a
29:07 - feature used by I don't know maybe a
29:10 - dozen people on campus so it just
29:14 - doesn't make sense to spend a whole lot
29:15 - of time nitpicking the details of this
29:18 - UI alright so now let's make sure that
29:22 - that email gets in to our forms J s file
29:28 - so let's see how how we're getting this
29:33 - data so we can move this over because we
29:38 - won't really need this just mark up for
29:43 - a little while let me see I'm gonna
29:46 - check my time in about five minutes I'm
29:49 - gonna take a five-minute break and I'm
29:52 - gonna go to the live shot here and
29:54 - answer some questions I don't want to
29:56 - get too far behind with the live chat so
29:58 - if you're asking questions you're
29:59 - wondering why I'm not reading your
30:01 - comments or questions
30:03 - I usually go back and forth between code
30:06 - and questions for a certain amount of
30:08 - time so I do code for about 25 minutes
30:09 - then I go back to the question and then
30:12 - at the end I'll just do a big question
30:15 - answer session and get through
30:16 - everything so if you can just hold on
30:19 - and you'll hang out in a live chat I'll
30:21 - get your question if you can't stick
30:23 - around you can always catch the
30:24 - recording of this later on and I'll
30:27 - answer your question you know whether
30:30 - you're here or not and and then it'll be
30:34 - recorded for you to to check out
30:38 - whenever you have time alright so let's
30:41 - see so a little bit about what's going
30:44 - on here maybe if you're not that
30:45 - familiar with jQuery this looks weird if
30:47 - you are familiar with jQuery this is
30:49 - pretty standard so we're just kidding
30:53 - so we're binding the submit event of our
30:56 - form so this is the idea is the
31:00 - announcement submit form and on click
31:04 - we're going to do something so we've
31:07 - passed in the events we have access to
31:08 - that the first thing we're going to do
31:12 - is check the length of our hidden
31:13 - checkbox so this is our security on the
31:16 - form right so I don't even know if this
31:23 - still works anymore but the idea at one
31:24 - point was like if a bot is trying to
31:27 - fill out your form like a spam bot then
31:30 - they they would check the hidden
31:33 - checkbox because they would see it in
31:35 - the markup but a real person would never
31:36 - see it and check it so so if the hidden
31:40 - checkbox is checked then you don't
31:43 - actually send the data right so that's
31:46 - where we're checking there so first
31:51 - thing we're if there's a request going
31:53 - we abort that request and oh man I'm
31:59 - seeing lots of variables here instead of
32:01 - constants Wow so here's our form
32:07 - container and we're just saving that to
32:09 - a variable so from now on dollar sign
32:12 - form is our form and we don't have to
32:14 - keep writing this selector anymore so
32:18 - we're going to get the inputs from form
32:21 - so we're finding all the possible inputs
32:23 - in that form so we're getting any
32:25 - element that is an input a select a
32:29 - button or a text area and then we're
32:33 - initializing some variables here for
32:35 - name value and iterator and then a
32:38 - checkbox we're grabbing the form
32:44 - elements let's see find on input type
32:48 - checkbox' all right so this is getting
32:53 - inputs but we're excluding some things
32:56 - we're excluding checkboxes we don't want
32:58 - the hidden one we're excluding the file
33:02 - type input and we're also grabbing
33:04 - uploads
33:06 - like remembering this as I go along so
33:09 - and remember it was nearly two years ago
33:14 - that I wrote this so be kind as you look
33:19 - upon my spaghetti code alright so we're
33:23 - going to serialize the data and so
33:30 - here's what we need to change right now
33:32 - we're checking local stores the profile
33:34 - that we have saved after someone logs in
33:36 - for the email we don't want to do that
33:39 - anymore
33:40 - we want to grab the email from that form
33:44 - data all right so let's see what the
33:51 - best way would be to change this we are
34:25 - okay I forgot I'm sending this all to a
34:28 - Google sheet and then from there from
34:35 - the Google sheet the email is being sent
34:38 - okay so I don't actually have any code
34:41 - that handles emails all right sometimes
34:51 - it helps to just look at your code even
34:53 - if you wrote it all right I gotta take a
35:00 - break for just a second because it is
35:03 - super hot in my office I'm gonna take
35:05 - off my sweater and then get back to it
35:07 - actually it's a bin all right it's been
35:10 - five minutes so I'm gonna take on my
35:11 - sweater and then we're going to I'm
35:14 - gonna go to the live chat answer some
35:15 - questions read some comments and then
35:17 - we'll come back and we'll grab that
35:19 - email from our new email input and that
35:26 - should be it
35:27 - there's one other place in the bulletin
35:29 - where there's a typo
35:31 - so maybe we can find that and fix it and
35:34 - then we can push all this to production
35:37 - and hope hopefully it all works all
35:43 - right I'm gonna scroll all the way to
35:44 - the top of the live chat sorry if I seem
35:49 - a little bit distracted for some reason
35:51 - like all these songs that I don't like
35:53 - keep playing on Spotify it's just
35:56 - bothering they think and then I keep
35:59 - switching them maybe I should just
36:02 - switch playlists
36:11 - alright there we are switch playing this
36:13 - should be a lot better all right rook or
36:19 - Nicki says old-school app made in 2016
36:22 - sounds about right front end moves so
36:23 - quickly
36:24 - yeah for sure see it's a lot of you
36:32 - saying hi I'm just I'm just to
36:34 - collectively say hi to everyone there's
36:36 - a lot of people in here
36:41 - they're nice that's crazy so old haven
36:45 - ich if you're still there I didn't see
36:48 - you at the beginning there but thanks
36:50 - for watching AHA John Hanson says hey
36:58 - all what jQuery Hank it's just kidding
37:13 - all right so Mari Marius let me know if
37:19 - I'm not pronouncing that correctly the
37:20 - Marius says up when the Mario says had
37:25 - depression too and help get out of it
37:28 - through exercise also says I'm so glad
37:30 - you're doing better talking about it
37:31 - it's a good move too too much stigma
37:34 - around discussing depression yeah I do
37:37 - want to say too with depression I've
37:40 - fallen into the trap before of thinking
37:43 - like hey I'm cured of depression and
37:44 - like stopping my medication and just
37:46 - stopping doing all these things that
37:48 - helped me and then I would fall back
37:51 - into it and it would take me a long time
37:53 - to get back out of it and you know get
37:55 - back to you know doing the things that
37:58 - helped me out so I'm gonna try my best
38:00 - not to fall into that again I'm gonna
38:02 - continue with my counseling my
38:03 - medication my exercise to be honest with
38:06 - you the counseling the medication or way
38:08 - easier than exercise for me like taking
38:10 - a pill not a big deal
38:11 - I'm going to go talk to somebody for you
38:14 - know an hour a month not really a big
38:16 - deal
38:17 - my counsellor is great I always feel
38:19 - like a million bucks after I leave
38:21 - counselling so the exercise would be the
38:25 - hardest but I just want to let you all
38:27 - know that that for me at least
38:29 - depression has never been a thing that I
38:31 - could just like say wow I'm cured it's
38:33 - gone it always comes back sometimes it
38:38 - takes longer than others but you know if
38:40 - you're in that place you know don't
38:42 - don't feel bad about I think that's just
38:44 - kind of the nature of some types of
38:47 - depression med asks why did you get
38:53 - depressed in the first place I don't
38:56 - really know you know why it was it's not
38:58 - like an event happened really that made
39:01 - me really depressed it's more like well
39:04 - as far as my doctors say it's more like
39:07 - a chemical imbalance like there's you
39:09 - know serotonin and different things in
39:10 - your brain that regulate your mood and
39:13 - my brain is not producing enough of that
39:15 - and certain things can help you get more
39:17 - like exercise or medications so that's
39:23 - that's where I'm at right now just
39:25 - trying to get back to
39:26 - like normal levels of you know whatever
39:29 - chemicals in my brain I'm supposed to
39:31 - have they're all right hey I have some
39:38 - of you are typing in Russian normally I
39:42 - would put that in Google Translate but
39:45 - I'm gonna go ahead because we just we
39:46 - have so many comments now that I'm not
39:49 - gonna do it right now maybe I'll do it
39:51 - later on though
39:53 - so apologies for that
40:17 - alright it looks like a lot of you
40:20 - thought that it was a really good idea
40:22 - to have that this whole website that
40:27 - we're thinking of doing with JavaScript
40:30 - AF kind of the a place for developers to
40:34 - showcase their work and encourage each
40:36 - other
40:45 - Jordan asked for links to tutorial
40:48 - videos Jordan let me know what tutorial
40:52 - videos you're talking about because I'm
40:54 - not 100% sure maybe I missed something
40:56 - in the chat or maybe I missed something
40:59 - I'm not sure what I was talking about
41:01 - there so let me know if you mean any of
41:04 - the doriel videos that I've done on my
41:06 - channel which I don't have that many
41:08 - videos yet but the link should be in the
41:10 - description to this to this video Oh
41:14 - horseshit I know you're not here anymore
41:16 - hardship but hard said might kill the
41:18 - forum thing it's getting useless I'm I
41:22 - don't I wouldn't kill the forum right
41:25 - away I think it's a good thing and I
41:27 - think I would rather not kill it but
41:30 - maybe move it to a sub-domain and I
41:35 - don't know you won't let me know what
41:38 - would you think but I thought the forum
41:40 - was really cool a cool idea alright so
41:49 - it's been about five minutes I'm going
41:51 - to go back to the code and try to finish
41:53 - this up I'll come back to I left off in
41:55 - the live chat after we finish this I'll
42:02 - see Sebastian's in the stream and I
42:04 - haven't seen Sebastian for a long time
42:05 - so hey Sebastian how's it going
42:07 - welcome back I'm really happy to see you
42:13 - alright so let's see and I just realized
42:18 - I haven't been using the Pomodoro timer
42:20 - so let me bring this over this is the
42:21 - one that I think this is the one Harsha
42:23 - built yeah
42:25 - so let's set this timer that way I don't
42:27 - have to keep watching the clock and
42:30 - let's grab let's see if we can grab our
42:33 - e-mail so we're bringing this data in
42:36 - we're grabbing these inputs and we're
42:40 - finding this funny funny
42:46 - I'm not sure what format we have this in
42:51 - so I want to see I'm gonna do a console
43:00 - log and I want to see what these form
43:05 - elements are let's check it out let's
43:14 - put something in here autofill some
43:18 - stuff and submit and inspect it see what
43:25 - we get
43:25 - dev tools popped up on that other screen
43:29 - and it's this one
43:35 - announcement text email says good let's
43:42 - make sure I don't have any more console
43:43 - logs in here it's possible console
43:46 - logging several things what one of 19
43:52 - I seriously have 19 console logs whoa
44:00 - all right let's get rid of a lot of
44:04 - these console logs what was I thinking
44:07 - 19 console logs all right I'm okay with
44:10 - with console logging this stuff for now
44:16 - all right I have some well I have a lot
44:20 - of stuff that's just commented out
44:29 - it's always crazy to go back and look at
44:31 - my old coat and just say what was I
44:33 - thinking
44:37 - all right so let's go
44:56 - I want to make sure I know which
45:00 - console.log this is so this is some es6
45:05 - template literal syntax so I use those
45:07 - back ticks and then everything in here
45:09 - is a string unless I put it in with
45:12 - within brackets starting with the dollar
45:14 - sign and then this is JavaScript so now
45:19 - I'll save that and I'm gonna bring this
45:22 - over here make it bigger so it's
45:24 - actually readable for you all let's
45:27 - clear this out and now I'll put my email
45:34 - back in and submit the air we are
45:37 - sisters look at this object object okay
45:39 - cool so we have an object alright I was
45:41 - hoping that we would have an object
45:44 - wonderful alright let's go over here so
45:49 - what I should be able to do is just grab
45:55 - that value let's get rid of this
46:21 - when we get that email oh I see
46:32 - so we are
46:46 - let's take this out of here so we're
46:52 - just going to define email here so it's
46:54 - still available in the scope that we
46:57 - need it but then within this function
47:01 - where we're serializing then I'm going
47:05 - to go here and say if name equals oops I
47:20 - need parentheses so if name equals email
47:34 - then we're going to set email equal to
47:43 - the value all right so now since we
47:50 - defined email here even though we're
47:53 - inside this this loop here we're gonna
47:58 - give email this value and then now we
48:03 - don't have to change anything else
48:05 - because anywhere that we're using the
48:07 - email variable down here it's just gonna
48:11 - pull this value so could we possibly
48:14 - refactor and make it a little bit nicer
48:20 - probably but as I said a few minutes ago
48:24 - this this particular update does not
48:27 - justify spending any more time than we
48:29 - absolutely have to and we're going to
48:31 - replace all the code sometime within the
48:35 - next a few months or so okay so now
48:39 - let's try it out
48:53 - so I'm submitting it it says it's been
48:56 - since although the result says error
48:59 - email invalid email I should let's clear
49:04 - it and then try it again
49:05 - I I'm not sure if that was from this
49:07 - time or the last time
49:17 - all right so in I'm getting an error and
49:21 - a success well the only way to be sure
49:23 - is to check my email
49:25 - so I do got my email open on my other
49:26 - screen and let's see where I should be
49:30 - getting an email at my gmail account and
49:34 - another email at my work account okay
49:42 - all right so we have an issue so right
49:47 - now it's coming through the message is
49:49 - coming through as test but the email is
49:52 - coming through is undefined so let's see
49:56 - what value were actually getting here
49:59 - now there's two ways that we could
50:01 - troubleshoot this right there's multiple
50:03 - ways so we could go in dev tools and
50:05 - check out the value of this or we could
50:07 - console.log console.log would probably
50:10 - be faster at this point but I would like
50:13 - to show you another way that we could we
50:16 - could get this so I don't usually do it
50:18 - this way but it is it can be really
50:24 - useful so let's check out our sources
50:27 - and Wow so many things well how do I
50:38 - have so many sources you know these are
50:45 - all my there we are
50:50 - alright so let's go to our forms and
50:52 - let's check out email so let's put in
51:03 - break right there so let's redo this and
51:09 - now we're gonna go to submit
51:13 - announcement and we'll put the email in
51:15 - or submit and we have a break point now
51:18 - right so I've added the break point so
51:21 - the code stops right here
51:26 - and I can check it says all right the
51:35 - email name equals no space
51:58 - all right so this looks kind of weird
52:02 - our serialized form elements end up
52:05 - being email equals Jessie why go at
52:13 - gmail.com and undefined equals and
52:18 - announcements that so we're doing
52:21 - something wrong let's figure out what
52:23 - we're doing wrong here where are we
52:30 - getting that undefined from
52:49 - you know what I believe we're adding we
52:55 - do need to do some stuff down here I
52:57 - think yeah we do all right let's go back
53:01 - to the code I was a little bit let's see
53:14 - all right
53:15 - King Darcy's one of C's my mistake
53:20 - hahaha good look good look at that
53:24 - good catch those equals all right thank
53:33 - you for catching that you all are great
53:35 - on that you always catch it before me so
53:38 - yeah I was using a comparison instead of
53:42 - assignment right so I was using the
53:44 - three equal signs instead of one so
53:47 - that's that's good but then I also
53:51 - remembered that with the serialized data
54:14 - why am i serializing the form elements
54:17 - and then making the serialized data am I
54:21 - even using the serialize form elements
54:24 - anymore
54:33 - I want to see what I'm doing with these
54:36 - one two three
54:39 - I'm not even using these all right I'm
54:45 - gonna leave it alone
54:47 - this definitely needs refactored there's
54:49 - stuff I'm not even using and we'll leave
54:52 - it alone but it should it should work
54:56 - all right let's see I think that I
55:01 - pulled this code from another project
55:03 - where I did need this and I just left it
55:08 - in there never took it out
55:22 - let's see
55:29 - all right when you refresh it should
55:35 - have refreshed I don't know what oh let
55:37 - me take this up and let me make sure I
55:41 - saved it there we are
55:45 - now let's give it another try
55:53 - all right yay all right wonderful I've
56:04 - received the confirmation so I received
56:07 - a notification at my work email that
56:10 - someone submitted a bulletin and then I
56:12 - received a notification at my personal
56:15 - email that my submission was received
56:19 - awesome very awesome
56:23 - all right cool okay so it works so the
56:29 - let's let me check my timer whoops all
56:35 - right so I have about ten minutes left
56:36 - at this point I want to very quickly
56:39 - find the typos that I had which a
56:42 - co-worker of mine found it so I'm going
56:45 - to go to my slack messages and look at
56:48 - that again
56:56 - okay great
57:05 - on the bulletin help page okay so it's
57:08 - on the help page which listen help I
57:20 - don't even remember what the help page
57:22 - is is it okay it's a separate it's a
57:28 - totally separate page okay let's see
57:32 - hopefully I actually have it in here but
57:36 - it will be suppose the dist index hmm
57:47 - help all right so have a whole nother
57:50 - folder that's for help
57:51 - let's look at the index and see what we
57:56 - can do
57:57 - all right so it says experience is
58:01 - misspelled expe r IE n c e h PE r IE NC
58:12 - all right cool let's just well that's
58:19 - too much let me make sure I'm not using
58:20 - it anywhere else
58:22 - expe o the end all right so that's not
58:28 - coming up at all good alright so that is
58:31 - ready I do have a dist folder let me see
58:39 - strength Inc how I got this help alright
58:42 - so help is included in the dist so I
58:45 - have this set up that I can just use
58:48 - gulp dist to make this ready but the
58:54 - last time I tried to run this it didn't
58:56 - actually do what it needed to do to all
59:00 - the proper file so I'm gonna go into dis
59:02 - now and make sure that we have changes
59:04 - in the proper file so it should be index
59:06 - and then that forms dot J s and we also
59:10 - need to have index dot HTML within help
59:15 - change as well so we're in the dist
59:17 - folder it looks like help did not change
59:19 - so we're gonna I just I'm just going to
59:23 - manually pull this over for now you can
59:26 - see like all the little places where
59:28 - things just did not get it it's just not
59:33 - good there's just little manual things
59:35 - that need to be done the build steps are
59:38 - just aren't good like compare that to
59:40 - something like using create react app
59:42 - and having all that done for you and and
59:47 - it's consistent it's reliable it's just
59:50 - a huge difference alright not that you
59:54 - couldn't do that in an app like this but
59:57 - it's not like it's not like I had an
60:01 - all-in-one like this is going to do
60:03 - everything I wanted to solution
60:05 - alright so that's there we can close up
60:07 - this help and our index dot HTML and I
60:13 - have great okay so check our status just
60:19 - to double-check at this distance
60:22 - awesome now the next step is let's do a
60:26 - commit let's say an email field to Miss
60:40 - submission form and we're gonna push
60:50 - that up to get up so again I apologize
60:53 - this is a private repo so you can't see
60:58 - the changes and then now I'm going to do
61:00 - fly production so I'm using an NPM
61:08 - module called flight plan which
61:12 - basically goes into your server and
61:16 - copies over your files into the right
61:19 - folder and it's really fast so that's it
61:25 - that should be working I'm going to
61:27 - double check
61:28 - by going to the bullets in the live
61:30 - version and actually let me bring this
61:36 - up on my screen
61:37 - No oh let's see all right so it's not
61:43 - working now but this would be a good
61:45 - test so this is the new login system the
61:49 - new possible way to log in that I'm
61:52 - going to test right now I tested it
61:54 - yesterday but can't hurt to test it
61:56 - again so now I've logged into our the
61:59 - university's single sign-on system that
62:01 - they call access fus I clicked
62:03 - University bulletin we just saw a second
62:05 - ago I was not logged in I click that and
62:08 - now I have access to the bulletin but
62:12 - there is no login info saved for me but
62:15 - if I go to submit announcement no no did
62:19 - not go there
62:23 - maybe there's some cat there we go
62:26 - it was just caching all right cool so
62:28 - now I have the email files let's do a
62:32 - live test of this and submit submission
62:40 - has been sent let's check my email to
62:44 - verify yes I just got verifications on
62:49 - Gmail and on my work account wonderful
62:52 - all right cool so everything worked out
62:56 - today maybe I'm better with jQuery than
62:59 - I am with react usually I break
63:02 - something with react oh wow so hopefully
63:06 - I I was trying to do a couple of things
63:09 - with this stream like other than just my
63:11 - normal like watch me at work you know
63:15 - type of thing and that was show an
63:18 - example of how I used to do things and
63:21 - kind of like hopefully see how far I've
63:24 - come and and really not that much time
63:27 - and also show an example of how things
63:30 - can just get really out of control when
63:33 - you try to like hand code everything and
63:36 - not use something like react or angular
63:38 - or your view to structure your
63:42 - it's possible I met all the user
63:44 - requirements with this it works it's
63:47 - reliable but it's it's kind of hard to
63:51 - maintain there's not really that much of
63:52 - a logic to it until I go back in and
63:55 - just look at what I've done so anyway I
64:00 - hopefully that was like somewhat evident
64:03 - to you all hopefully I don't have to go
64:07 - back in and mess with this very for very
64:10 - much longer and we get that react
64:12 - version going so with the time we have
64:17 - left which is only three minutes so I'm
64:20 - not going to do any more code now I'm
64:21 - going to go back to the live chat and
64:23 - I'm going to answer all your questions
64:25 - read out comments and so anything that
64:29 - you want to talk about put it in the
64:30 - live chat let's scroll up okay
64:36 - Zuber says no fireplace please instead
64:39 - use Postgres alright so Zubair if you're
64:43 - still there let me know why you don't
64:46 - think firebase would be a good fit for
64:48 - this Anne Hale says MongoDB we can
64:56 - definitely look into using for
64:59 - sure
65:00 - oh okay hard mate that's right okay
65:05 - so I don't I don't know if our should
65:06 - still here or not the Harsha did make
65:08 - that chat app with firebase so I'm not
65:10 - sure if he shared that with everyone in
65:12 - the live chat but I I remember logging
65:14 - into that before so that's awesome
65:17 - so since Harshit is already familiar
65:19 - with firebase that might be a good way
65:21 - to go though just to save the time of
65:23 - having to learn something else
65:30 - Anoop says horseshit you're pumped up
65:32 - yeah hard should it always has a lot of
65:34 - enthusiasm I really love that about
65:37 - Harshit and he has the skills to back it
65:39 - up so Nicky says firebase is pretty easy
65:50 - to use but apparently gets expensive
65:52 - when your site gets popular all right I
65:56 - can see that but I wonder is it more
66:00 - expensive if your site at really popular
66:04 - is it more expensive to use firebase or
66:06 - would it be more expensive to try to do
66:08 - the same thing by scaling like manually
66:11 - scaling up servers and handling all that
66:15 - so ideally if our site they'd get
66:18 - popular we would either get some funding
66:20 - from investors or donations or let's say
66:25 - advertising or you know probably like
66:28 - job listing types types of things I
66:30 - think a job listing would be the most
66:32 - useful kind of advertising for
66:34 - developers because developers probably
66:39 - are looking for a job or at least would
66:42 - like to see what's out there if we start
66:45 - if we did would do advertisements for
66:47 - products I mean it could possibly be
66:50 - useful but I could see that becoming a
66:52 - little bit I don't kind of more annoying
66:57 - that's just me I don't let me know what
66:59 - you all think
67:05 - on how us if there was a repo of the
67:08 - project that I was talking about and
67:10 - this is that JavaScript AF project we're
67:12 - talking about the beginning I haven't
67:14 - made a repo yet JavaScript there made a
67:17 - repo that's just gonna be like a static
67:20 - HTML site just to kind of get the layout
67:23 - done which i think is a great idea
67:27 - because it at least for me a lot of
67:31 - times a static HTML site is just so much
67:34 - easier to to do things in to make like
67:38 - UI changes you don't really need to add
67:41 - all that other stuff that comes with
67:43 - building out react you don't need you
67:46 - know at that point once we're you know
67:48 - pretty satisfied with the UI then we can
67:51 - always start making that UI in react
67:55 - kind of like how we did for cat a
67:57 - chemical Institute but we're gonna do a
67:59 - better job of it
68:06 - guitar says M lab is free check it out I
68:09 - think we've worked with M lab in the in
68:11 - the past on houses MongoDB Atlas has a
68:18 - free version cool thank you for all the
68:22 - the suggestions here I really appreciate
68:24 - this ambition says do you code on the
68:29 - weekends sometimes it depends I really I
68:34 - try to save the weekends for hanging out
68:36 - with my family but when I was doing the
68:39 - Udacity react nanodegree I I coded on
68:42 - the weekends when I have a client on the
68:44 - side I code on the weekends so it just
68:49 - depends on what's going on right now my
68:51 - wife is doing she she's doing to like
68:56 - boot camp programs at once so she's
68:58 - gonna Udacity nano degree and she was
69:01 - doing the flat iron boot camp at the
69:03 - same time so the weekends like she
69:06 - needed all the time on the weekend to do
69:08 - that she just graduated from Flatirons
69:10 - boot camp so maybe she won't need as
69:15 - much time we'll see so right now I'm
69:18 - doing
69:19 - little Cody on the weekends but that
69:22 - sometimes I do a lot it just depends
69:34 - Zuber asked if javascript err and hard
69:37 -  username used by the same person
69:38 - oh no no it's dude JavaScript and
69:41 - harshin or two different people
69:57 - michael said just got here and i think i
70:00 - really missed the most important part of
70:01 - the chat all right Michael if you're
70:03 - still there I guess just go back and
70:07 - watch their recording I don't sorry I'm
70:15 - gonna need a drink after fit and I can't
70:20 - get rid of mic off it's not nearly as
70:23 - bad as it was the last week but it's
70:27 - like still there let's see I lost my
70:34 - place here
70:53 - Stephen s if if we're gonna cry when we
70:56 - see this meaning my jQuery mess Alexis's
71:05 - jQuery is still used to s go yeah yeah I
71:08 - know it's definitely still still used
71:12 - Stephen says Jessi's confidence level is
71:14 - scaring me today I'm not sure what you
71:19 - made does it seem like I have a lot of
71:21 - confidence today or not a lot of
71:22 - confidence it feels like I'm the normal
71:27 - amount but I don't know and is that a
71:31 - good thing or a bad thing if I'm more or
71:34 - less confident
71:37 - Zuber says think about parcel jazz okay
71:41 - I haven't heard about parcel jazz
71:45 - Siraj says parcel is the new build tools
71:48 - oh okay
71:50 - and Mayer says partially I'm loving
71:52 - alright wow I'm totally like out of the
71:55 - loop here I didn't know that I don't
71:58 - remember parcel Jess at all I'll
72:00 - definitely have to check that up the
72:05 - JavaScript just says if you want to talk
72:06 - more about the project you can DM me on
72:11 - insta yeah me as well you know there's a
72:14 - variety of ways to get in touch with me
72:16 - so whatever way is most comfortable to
72:18 - you you know just let me know
72:20 - email Twitter LinkedIn Facebook one of
72:25 - the Instagram any of the social media
72:27 - stuff I'm on just you know message me
72:44 - all right Michael Chris has defined
72:46 - spaghetti
72:48 - yes so when I say spaghetti code usually
72:52 - it's just like to me I don't know if
72:56 - there's an official definition right
72:58 - like it's it's just kind of like a term
73:01 - that people use to describe code that's
73:05 - kind of like gotten out of control out
73:07 - of order it's it's not separated out
73:10 - logically so that was that's what tends
73:14 - to happen on some projects that were you
73:17 - either and it doesn't you don't have to
73:20 - use jQuery for to turn out a spaghetti
73:22 - code you could be using vanilla
73:24 - JavaScript you custom make everything
73:27 - like the routing and all that which is
73:30 - great and it could be really clean at
73:32 - first when it's small but then you come
73:34 - back in later on and sometimes you have
73:36 - to add a feature here there it doesn't
73:38 - scale well you end up just adding on
73:41 - pieces of code sometimes you don't
73:43 - remove old pieces because you need it
73:46 - for this one thing and then later on you
73:49 - may not need it anymore but you don't
73:51 - remember that you don't need it so like
73:53 - I went back in and found a variable that
73:56 - I I wasn't using at all so evidently
74:00 - when I was working through that I left
74:03 - it in there for a reason and then forgot
74:05 - to take it out so that's kind of what I
74:09 - mean by spaghetti code it's all jumbled
74:11 - up like spaghetti and it's hard to take
74:13 - it apart right it's hard to just take
74:15 - like one strand of spaghetti and
74:17 - separate at all you know with before you
74:20 - had to stick your fork in and do that
74:21 - it's hard so in the same way it's hard
74:23 - to just separate out parts of your code
74:25 - like you could and react right like in
74:28 - react you have your component if you do
74:30 - it right you know you could remove that
74:32 - component and pop it in another project
74:35 - and with minimal changes or sometimes no
74:38 - changes it can work hopefully that makes
74:40 - sense let me know if it doesn't or let
74:43 - me know if I'm wrong about spaghetti
74:44 - code it means something totally
74:45 - different than I think it means
75:09 - see
75:15 - Gander 7 says I watch from work and
75:18 - couldn't pay attention because of Ward
75:20 - discussion when you were pitching an app
75:21 - idea at the beginning could you recap if
75:23 - you figure out what I'm asking
75:26 - yeah sure Gander 7 I mean the best recap
75:30 - is going to be just to watch the the
75:34 - replay but just a very short recap is
75:36 - it's going to be a website where
75:38 - developers can have a profile on there
75:40 - where it'll just you'll sign in with
75:42 - github it can pull data from about your
75:46 - repos and things and you can share
75:47 - projects you're working on and talk with
75:49 - other developers and it could be a place
75:52 - to you know highlight your work I'm kind
75:54 - of hoping that it would end up being a
75:56 - place where the focus is mainly on
76:01 - projects especially maybe smaller more
76:04 - obscure projects that are really cool
76:05 - the people working on to kind of bring
76:07 - it to the community and you know get
76:10 - some more exposure for that and also a
76:12 - place where I mean let's face it like a
76:15 - lot of the other social media places
76:17 - they're all this other stuff aside from
76:20 - coding right so it would be nice to have
76:23 - a place to go where the focus is mainly
76:25 - just you know coding and developer
76:28 - related stuff and not necessarily you
76:31 - know other stuff that's going on in the
76:32 - world there's it's important to talk
76:34 - about other things but sometimes you
76:37 - don't want all that other distraction
76:39 - around so this will like be purposely
76:43 - focused on one group just developers and
76:49 - only on topics that relate to to
76:52 - developers
77:06 - on Hill says we can open an issue with
77:09 - the subject about this project or
77:12 - JavaScript er you can write the
77:14 - description of the project in the readme
77:16 - of the repo yeah that's actually a great
77:18 - idea thanks for that I know we should
77:20 - definitely just explain everything and
77:23 - have it there for everyone to see
77:25 - old sauce says why is jQuery so bad
77:29 - where is where it's best use and where
77:33 - you don't have to use it all right so
77:36 - yeah I guess I don't want to give the
77:39 - impression that jQuery is terrible to
77:41 - use because I think some people it seems
77:45 - like they believe that but I really
77:47 - don't believe that I think jQuery has
77:49 - its place I will say this if you're
77:52 - working with react you should probably
77:54 - not use jQuery because any Dom
77:56 - manipulation with jQuery is going to
77:59 - circumvent reacts you know the component
78:02 - lifecycle so you're not going to get
78:04 - that you're not going to trigger a
78:05 - rerender with within react you really
78:10 - should do everything like that within
78:11 - state so try to avoid it with react but
78:18 - if you had a project that was not react
78:23 - based than you wanted to add some jQuery
78:26 - stuff it could be a very helpful library
78:28 - can help you do more in less time than
78:30 - if you try to do it all which is vanilla
78:32 - JavaScript jQuery can be very helpful
78:35 - especially for beginners we're just
78:38 - trying to get started and get a feel for
78:40 - doing things I mean yes I think we can
78:43 - all agree that learning to do things the
78:45 - vanilla JavaScript way and the long run
78:47 - is very good for a developer but
78:48 - sometimes newer developers need to have
78:51 - some successes and need to be able to
78:54 - build cool things early on to keep their
78:56 - spirits up and to make it through this
78:59 - you know we all know there's ups and
79:01 - downs you gotta have some thing to look
79:03 - back on to say wow I did that to get you
79:06 - through those Downs
79:07 - I think jQuery you can very very quickly
79:11 - be able to make some cool things also
79:15 - you know people talk a lot about how
79:17 - it's bad that jQuery
79:19 - is this big library you bring in and
79:21 - sometimes you only use a tiny piece of
79:22 - that library well the fact is that most
79:26 - sites on the internet use jQuery so the
79:28 - odds that somebody already has that you
79:31 - know cache somewhere especially if you
79:34 - use a CDN are pretty good so the the
79:38 - cost of that size of you know jQuery is
79:43 - really mitigated by that so all in all I
79:46 - I'm not if you use jQuery I'm not at all
79:49 - trying to say you're bad develop or
79:51 - anything
79:51 - obviously I've used a lot of jQuery on
79:54 - projects I even usually carry on a
79:56 - project within the last year that we
79:58 - completed so I will say this in terms of
80:05 - just don't use it if you don't have to
80:08 - if you only need to use a little bit of
80:10 - jQuery it might be worth it to look up
80:12 - how to do it with another JavaScript
80:16 - yeah so that's my take on it if you
80:19 - disagree please let me know in the live
80:22 - chat or if you agree but have something
80:25 - to add to that please let me know
80:36 - see
80:41 - [Music]
80:43 - started
80:56 - then this is hello from Russia hey how's
80:58 - it going thanks for joining us no my AB
81:05 - said is that visual code on Linux on
81:10 - houses Syed yes I use it on the moon too
81:13 - yes it is available on on Linux yeah
81:19 - Dennis wants to see my plugins for
81:21 - Visual Studio code sure let's view
81:26 - extensions alright here's what I have
81:33 - let me get rid of these it's not gonna
81:37 - let me alright so here's what I have now
81:40 - most of these extensions can be added if
81:43 - you just get the react food-truck
81:46 - extension react food-truck will
81:49 - automatically add a bunch of these in
81:51 - but if you do that I highly recommend
81:54 - that you disable import cost because it
82:00 - uses a lot of resources on your machine
82:02 - and it caused me to drop a lot of frames
82:05 - in my streams
82:06 - Harshit said it either crashed or almost
82:09 - crashed his computer so yeah so just be
82:15 - aware of that if you end up getting
82:17 - react food-truck
82:19 - so all I guess I'll just scroll slowly
82:21 - through this and then if you want if you
82:25 - need to pause on one of them just you
82:27 - know what you can pause the video or go
82:29 - back and watch the recording javascript
82:37 - or says I hate depression I suffer from
82:39 - it as well as anxiety yeah yeah for sure
82:43 - the anxiety occasionally I have trouble
82:46 - with anxiety but I've been it's been
82:48 - good I used to have panic attacks but
82:50 - it's been years since I had a panic
82:52 - attack and I really like I'm a lot
82:56 - better with that John Henson says about
83:02 - jQuery the jQuery is not bad though it
83:04 - does not run natively inside a browser
83:05 - therefore a library needs to be running
83:07 - inside
83:08 - browser in order for it to call the
83:09 - JavaScript so there's data overhead that
83:13 - is that's well said so I definitely
83:17 - agree with that his access I went
83:21 - through a two
83:32 - Oh Peter says Visual Studio code is also
83:36 - available on Debian and Red Hat Patrick
83:45 - says Patrick O'Donnell says hey walking
83:48 - 20 minutes a day is all the exercise you
83:50 - probably need it or wonders good luck
83:52 - cool yeah actually I've heard that my
83:55 - wife was telling me that she read that I
83:57 - don't actually need to exercise for that
83:59 - long to get the the mental benefits so
84:03 - I'm gonna keep that in mind
84:06 - but so I made a room for myself that if
84:10 - I'm exercising on the exercise bike I
84:13 - get to play the Nintendo switch so it's
84:18 - incentive for me to play otherwise my
84:20 - kids always want to play and it's like I
84:22 - just don't get to so I kind of want to
84:27 - keep exercising for 45 minutes because
84:30 - you can't get that much done in 20
84:32 - minutes right but anyway I'll keep that
84:37 - in mind because sometimes if I didn't
84:39 - get my full 45 minutes in I would feel
84:41 - bad about it which is I didn't want to
84:43 - feel about I'm exercising so I can feel
84:44 - better so I'll keep in mind that I
84:47 - really don't need that 45 minutes and
84:49 - that's just extra I think you know that
84:51 - that'll mentally that'll be better for
84:53 - me
84:57 - Dennis said I can translate from Russian
84:59 - if you need oh cool cool thank you
85:03 - Blake says why the dot af you know the
85:07 - UM alright I could say okay Michael
85:11 - criolla explain that all right thanks
85:13 - thanks for Michael yeah I just got the
85:19 - domain name is kind of like a joke cuz I
85:22 - thought it would be like it'd just be
85:25 - cool to have I wasn't sure what I would
85:26 - do with it so that's why I got it I just
85:30 - it like I realized that dot AF names
85:34 - were thing and you could actually get it
85:35 - it's the Afghanistan like code so I
85:40 - immediately just started typing things
85:43 - in to see if they were available
85:44 - and JavaScript was one of the first ones
85:46 - I tagged in it was available so I got it
85:51 - JavaScript er says I'm getting a lot of
85:54 - good feedback from it awesome
85:59 - my AB says yep I found a flat pack for
86:03 - Visual Studio code cool I'm not sure I
86:06 - don't know what flat pack does let me
86:09 - know Sebastian says quick TL TL DR so
86:17 - too long didn't read on the JavaScript
86:19 - thing happens haven't been seeing the
86:21 - stream in a while yeah well hopefully
86:30 - you've you're still on and you've heard
86:32 - me explain it a couple times so let me
86:34 - know if you need some more explanation
86:36 - though but I think we've got over - a
86:37 - couple times down
86:49 - Sebastian says hey I've been working
86:51 - hard I have this week off so I'm
86:53 - catching around awesome well enjoy your
86:55 - week off I'm glad you decided to spend
86:57 - some of it here with us Oh
87:05 - Alexi said the chat has been buggy is
87:08 - anyone else having a problem with the
87:09 - chat
87:10 - it seemed okay for me but I wasn't
87:12 - really in it a lot I was on my other
87:15 - screen
87:25 - Sebastian says get a dot tk1
87:28 - it's free and more popular what's the
87:36 - dot tk1 am i missing the the joke with a
87:41 - dot CK domain
87:55 - Aleksey says da da f domains are
87:57 - expensive where can I get that domain
87:59 - cheap
88:00 - I don't really know it was kind of
88:02 - expensive it's more than I've ever paid
88:05 - for a domains oh it was like an impulse
88:09 - buy I was like oh this I just have to do
88:12 - it so I don't I don't know if you can
88:16 - get a cheaper I didn't find it anywhere
88:18 - cheaper Michael says between yesterday's
88:27 - group chat and now today's look at your
88:30 - spaghetti I'm feeling better about the
88:32 - code block I'm experiencing all right
88:35 - well I'm glad I mean I always say this
88:37 - if I want you all to see when I mess
88:42 - things up because I think it is
88:44 - important to see other developers
88:47 - messing things up trying to work through
88:49 - it especially messing up just simple
88:51 - things like I messed up and put three
88:53 - equal signs instead of one equal sign
88:55 - right like especially for developers who
88:59 - work alone or freelance or something
89:01 - like it's easy to get the idea from
89:05 - social media from other YouTube videos
89:08 - that there's all these developers out
89:10 - there that are awesome and the don't
89:11 - make as many mistakes as you do but
89:15 - that's not the case
89:17 - at least I think it's not the case
89:18 - because I make a lot of mistakes show so
89:21 - I just kind of wanted to share that
89:23 - right because we we don't naturally want
89:25 - to show our mistakes right we want to
89:28 - post a selfie online and we take 50
89:29 - selfies and post the best one right we
89:32 - don't post normally all the worst ones
89:34 - right it's the same way with our code
89:36 - right we don't post our terrible code
89:39 - and we don't post to you know talk about
89:43 - how much how the crazy ridiculous simple
89:46 - mistakes we made so anyway my point is
89:50 - that I'm glad that it was working out
89:52 - that way for you Michael
89:57 - Oh Michael said by the way the : in the
90:01 - days remaining give is making my OCD
90:04 - kicking super hard these remaining I
90:07 - don't know where that div is alright let
90:10 - me get rid of these extensions I kind of
90:15 - want to see this this day let's see I
90:25 - don't even know where I have these
90:27 - remaining on here oh whoa
90:29 - let's see I lost my place
90:38 - sorry sometimes the chat just Scrolls
90:42 - down all the way to the bottom
91:01 - King Dhara aha so King Ghidorah kept
91:05 - pointing out my mistake with the equal
91:06 - signs he said I was going crazy over
91:11 - here I know sorry it took me so long to
91:14 - look over I just I always forget that
91:16 - you all probably see it before I do and
91:19 - I should have just looked at the
91:20 - teachers I didn't realize that I had a
91:22 - mistake for a while though anyways david
91:30 - says Jessie you remember our venerable
91:31 - code opulent and imperial gazing proudly
91:34 - from its stoic perch above the page
91:38 - alright that's a different one today
91:40 - David
91:51 - I'm wondering so David is that a quote
91:53 - from something because I don't I don't
91:56 - really know what it's from anyway let me
92:02 - know
92:15 - all right so javascript is made an issue
92:17 - in the github repo on on javascript or
92:21 - github account where we can all discuss
92:24 - the project
92:42 - max put a like a sleeping emoji so I
92:48 - don't know what I was doing at that time
92:50 - in the stream but it must have been
92:51 - boring
92:52 - sorry max King Doris says the reason I'm
92:58 - not a fan of firebase is because it
93:00 - feels dirty to put all of the back-end
93:01 - data management logic in the client does
93:06 - that matter maybe I'm using it wrong
93:09 - I don't really know King Ghidorah
93:12 - I like I said the only thing I've seen
93:14 - about firebase is from YouTube videos I
93:16 - haven't actually used it yet I'm gonna
93:21 - have to talk to some people that have
93:22 - used it I know hard has enough to
93:24 - talk more with hardship and maybe I'll
93:27 - just try to you know reach out to people
93:29 - to see if someone can fill me in on the
93:33 - pros and cons of using it
93:41 - King Doris's and I know firebase
93:44 - functions are a thing but I haven't
93:45 - heard much about them yeah I haven't
93:47 - heard anything about them either
93:49 - Jordan says go server list with AWS yeah
93:54 - I'm like it I'm open for any suggestions
93:56 - on this right now I just threw out
93:58 - firebase kind of to kind of get things
94:00 - started get the discussion started but
94:03 - the way I look at different technologies
94:05 - is you have your user stories you know
94:08 - what you want to accomplish now find the
94:10 - technology that will accomplish that the
94:13 - best way
94:13 - the quickest way the cheapest way what
94:16 - you know whatever you needed to do find
94:19 - what's going to get that done for you so
94:21 - I'm not tied to any one technology it
94:24 - would be nice to use something that I'm
94:26 - familiar with there'd be less learning
94:30 - involved for me I'm not opposed to
94:31 - learning but I just know like I'm
94:33 - realistic with my time to know if you
94:36 - know I might not it might take a lot
94:38 - longer if I have to learn something new
94:40 - before I can help out on this project
94:46 - Michael Chris has no ads please no ads
94:49 - JavaScript er says yeah no ads trust me
94:53 - that Lexi said ads aren't bad take a
94:56 - look at carbonize yeah I I don't want to
95:01 - put ads on there like I said the only
95:03 - thing they even remotely close to ads
95:05 - that I'd be okay with or job postings
95:07 - because to me like that's that's helpful
95:10 - to developers right when you go on Stack
95:13 - Overflow you see the job postings on the
95:15 - side that never annoys me I'm I think
95:18 - it's I'd like to see like oh yeah what
95:21 - jobs are out there what are they asking
95:22 - for what are the titles even if I'm not
95:24 - looking for a job it's still nice to
95:26 - stay up to date on that so that's what
95:30 - I'm talking about
95:30 - I really would like to stay away from
95:32 - ads if possible I mean but all like
95:37 - realistically at some point if it gets
95:39 - really big in the cost for servers and
95:40 - everything is really high something's
95:43 - gonna have to happen it doesn't have to
95:45 - be ads but something needs to happen so
95:47 - that can be paid for I am NOT
95:49 - independently wealthy
95:50 - so either like Bitcoin has to get to a
95:53 - million dollars
95:54 - or I have to win the lottery or we got
95:57 - to find some other way to this before
95:59 - tea
96:09 - michael says the customers who would
96:11 - come to the site have a ad-blockers
96:13 - install so it would be a waste of time
96:15 - to set them up it could be I don't
96:18 - really mind ads that sometimes it's
96:20 - useful if they give me like targeted ads
96:22 - based on my interests sometimes I see it
96:25 - I'm like oh yeah I did want that thing
96:30 - Alexi says I guess it depends on the
96:32 - person I whitelist pages that I want to
96:35 - support
96:35 - I also whitelist youtubers I'll export
96:38 - oh that's a good idea I never thought
96:40 - about that but I don't run an ad blocker
96:43 - on my regular browser I do have it on
96:46 - one of my browsers but that is a really
96:49 - good idea about whitelist things to
96:51 - support the site's you do work I like
96:53 - that Mikael says hi what are you
96:56 - building in this particular stream I was
97:01 - building I was doing some updates on a
97:03 - jQuery single page application that I
97:06 - had built two years ago and I was just
97:09 - adding in a new field to a form and
97:13 - connecting that up with we were sending
97:17 - it to a Google sheet and then that would
97:20 - be emailed from there
97:32 - Oh Mykel creo sorry Michael so I thought
97:37 - Michael had asked me to define spaghetti
97:38 - codes spaghetti code but he actually
97:41 - said definitely spaghetti sorry I went
97:45 - through that whole explanation Michael
97:48 - also says believe me I know what
97:49 - spaghetti code is I have a pasta master
97:52 - so sorry about that Michael well maybe
97:57 - somebody out there didn't know what it
97:58 - was so hopefully that was useful to
98:00 - someone
98:20 - Michael said Jessie developers need
98:23 - their ups and downs to make the ups feel
98:25 - better me you're preaching to the crowd
98:29 - okay so quote quoting me and then he
98:31 - says me you're preaching to the crowd
98:32 - brother yeah I mean yeah that's just how
98:36 - it is that's I think just the nature of
98:38 - it that you you get sometimes you feel
98:42 - amazing you build something really cool
98:44 - you've solved the problem and then other
98:46 - times it's just like you you question
98:48 - your the decisions you've made in life
98:50 - that brought you to this point so I
98:54 - think as you get more experienced as a
98:57 - developer the lows aren't quite so bad
99:01 - I've and the highs are you're more
99:07 - realistic about the highest right so I
99:09 - don't really get to the point anymore
99:10 - I'm like yes I'm awesome like I know
99:13 - everything and I think that's a good
99:15 - thing because I know enough now to know
99:19 - that I'll never know enough right
99:22 - there's always going to be more to learn
99:24 - but I also know enough to know like all
99:28 - right if I totally mess something up or
99:30 - I can't get it to work like that's okay
99:32 - it happens I just need to you know keep
99:36 - working at it or you know ask for help
99:38 - or do something so but I think it's
99:42 - hardest on newer developers you know
99:44 - they don't have as much time to be able
99:49 - to look back on and say yeah I remember
99:50 - that time when I couldn't get this to
99:53 - work and I remember that time when I did
99:54 - this and that was awesome so I don't
100:00 - know anything to help new developers
100:02 - kind of get past that to kind of keep
100:04 - them humble on when they're really up
100:06 - and to keep their spirits up when
100:09 - they're really low I think is a good
100:11 - thing and that's that's probably one of
100:14 - the most important things I think new
100:16 - developers need because there's a wealth
100:18 - of information to help them but like the
100:21 - emotional aspect of it is not it's not
100:25 - as easy to find help with that
100:26 - especially if you're on your own
100:36 - David says I'm learning JavaScript now
100:38 - and still trying to see if I should
100:39 - continue or go to jQuery I think I'm
100:42 - almost at the end of my JavaScript
100:44 - learning David yeah I mean I you don't
100:52 - need to go to jQuery right if you know
100:54 - JavaScript well you can do everything
100:56 - that jQuery can do and just plain
100:58 - vanilla JavaScript there jQuery can just
101:02 - make it will be shorter for you to write
101:05 - even though like technically you're
101:06 - adding in a lot of extra code because
101:08 - you're you have the whole library in but
101:10 - from your perspective which you actually
101:12 - have to write could be less it could be
101:15 - easier to reason about it so it just
101:18 - depends there's a lot of different
101:22 - things you can get into to learn though
101:23 - with with Java scripts besides jQuery it
101:27 - just kind of depends on what you want to
101:28 - do there's so many I mean you can do
101:30 - back-end stuff in JavaScript with node
101:31 - you can do VR stuff with node now you
101:35 - can do machine learning which I love the
101:39 - script
101:40 - I'm not saying javascript is the best
101:42 - way to use machine learning the people
101:44 - have strong opinions about that but is
101:46 - possible you can even do Internet of
101:48 - Things stuff with JavaScript so there's
101:53 - a lot of different ways you could go
101:57 - also says totally review with you Jesse
102:00 - about jQuery good to practice and learn
102:01 - and after that try react see David David
102:09 - says are there things in JavaScript that
102:12 - I simply won't need as a web developer
102:13 - oh yeah absolutely
102:15 - absolutely there's there's I've been a
102:18 - web developer for I don't even know like
102:21 - let's just say like five years give or
102:23 - take a little bit and there are still
102:26 - parts of JavaScript that I I've probably
102:28 - never even seen it's certainly never
102:30 - used so yeah you definitely don't need
102:33 - everything as a web developer my method
102:36 - of learning has usually been I learned
102:39 - what I need to for a project
102:42 - and I build on that sometimes if I have
102:45 - time which is rare these days you know I
102:48 - could read a book about JavaScript and
102:50 - learn some things that I never knew and
102:51 - don't really need right now
102:52 - but once you start to get busy with with
102:55 - clients or something like it's just
102:57 - really hard to just study JavaScript so
102:59 - if you're in a position of a student
103:00 - that's great and take advantage of that
103:03 - and learn a lot but if you're actually
103:05 - trying to make money and have a family
103:07 - or have responsibilities to take up a
103:09 - lot of your time learn what you have to
103:11 - learn to get the job done and try to do
103:13 - your best to piece it all together on
103:20 - kids please can anyone tell me which is
103:23 - a good place to learn web development
103:24 - other than free code camp code Academy
103:28 - is good Udacity is good I don't really
103:37 - do much on udemy but people say udemy is
103:40 - good West vos has all these courses that
103:43 - everybody talks about says how great
103:45 - they are I haven't done one of the West
103:47 - vos courses but a lot of people that I I
103:50 - know are good developers say that the
103:52 - courses are good so maybe want to check
103:54 - that out
104:27 - David says that Kevin Powell dev tips
104:34 - and Brad if you see also have great
104:38 - videos on YouTube that's yeah I have
104:41 - never watched anything well I've watched
104:43 - it it's but not the other two but I
104:45 - really do like dev tips some of that
104:48 - stuff is a little bit old but I think
104:50 - it's still really useful a lot of the
104:51 - stuff about CSS and just general design
104:53 - principles are really good and the guy
104:59 - who is Travis a Travis's are really like
105:01 - positive uplifting personality I always
105:04 - like that about the dev tip videos Alexi
105:10 - says has someone done freelancing in up
105:13 - work or some other platform I'm in the
105:16 - urge for money I haven't done something
105:20 - like up work but so I can't speak
105:26 - personally from it but if you're gonna
105:28 - do some sort of online platform I
105:30 - definitely do one that makes you take a
105:33 - test to get into and really like make
105:36 - sure that you get paid what you're worth
105:38 - some of them just let anybody in and
105:42 - then you end up getting outbid and if
105:45 - you get a job you have to get underpaid
105:47 - like severely underpaid so that would be
105:50 - my only advice and going with different
105:52 - work things so I'm not familiar with up
105:54 - work in particular so I can't say
105:56 - anything specifically to that but just
105:58 - in general like freelancing platforms
106:00 - that's that would be my advice
106:13 - Alexei says I would do websites for food
106:25 - Stefan says what do you think about view
106:29 - I have not used you I don't have a
106:31 - personal opinion above you based on
106:34 - experience but there are developers that
106:37 - I think are great and that I respect
106:39 - that love you so I have it generally a
106:45 - good opinion about you but I just don't
106:47 - really know enough about it to give you
106:49 - more than that if anybody else has
106:52 - worked with you before please let us
106:54 - know in the latch at when you think
106:56 - about it
107:06 - Oh Michael Caruso is on the site between
107:08 - the counters you have a days remaining
107:12 - display with 1800 on the actual site
107:15 - yeah this is yeah that's not me I don't
107:20 - make that I don't manage any of the
107:22 - content on this site so I can't do
107:25 - anything about this these are like
107:26 - pre-made in Photoshop or something
107:43 - let's see so CMD in code so I'm guessing
107:48 - it's command in code says do you think
107:50 - someone should learn vanilla JavaScript
107:52 - before jQuery or another library or do
107:54 - you think it helps to illustrate some
107:56 - fundamentally important concepts I have
108:01 - some mixed feelings about this so all
108:05 - right here's how I feel if you're having
108:07 - like a free online like learning
108:09 - tutorial for people to learn on their
108:11 - own
108:12 - I think jQuery can be very useful early
108:14 - on even before you get to other
108:16 - JavaScript stuff to build up some of
108:18 - that confidence if you're teaching
108:20 - JavaScript in a like a university I
108:23 - would not go with jQuery first unless
108:27 - the course was like I don't know like
108:30 - web development for non computer science
108:32 - majors who just want to get into
108:34 - something maybe I'd do it then but if
108:36 - you're really trying to learn
108:37 - programming in Shawano javascript in a
108:39 - university I would go vanilla JavaScript
108:43 - otherwise if it's just an online course
108:46 - center of course I would go jQuery and
108:49 - like I said earlier I think the key is
108:52 - you want to help people who are new who
108:55 - are most like that on their own and
108:56 - don't know other developers you want to
108:58 - help them start to get that feeling of
109:00 - I'm really building something cool like
109:02 - to feel the magic of web development
109:05 - right I mean like you understand I'm
109:07 - saying with the magic like things
109:09 - working on the page you click the button
109:11 - and things happen like it when you first
109:13 - do that it feels great like you're
109:16 - creating things and and they're they're
109:19 - cool so going in first what jQuery
109:23 - allows you to do that and then if they
109:26 - really want to stick with it they're
109:28 - gonna eventually get into the vanilla
109:30 - JavaScript like it's they're gonna have
109:31 - to write so that's my take on it I'm
109:35 - definitely open to hearing alternative
109:37 - opinions about that too I mean I'm I'm
109:40 - no expert but that's that's generally
109:43 - how I feel about it I started out I
109:46 - don't know probably with a blend of
109:48 - JavaScript and jQuery I tried my best to
109:51 - to learn both but realistically when I
109:55 - had
109:56 - projects that needed to get done I
109:58 - turned to jQuery most of the time
110:00 - because that was the easiest quickest
110:02 - way for me to get things done it wasn't
110:06 - until I really started getting serious
110:07 - with react that I forced myself to learn
110:09 - how to do more with vanilla JavaScript
110:15 - so anyway hopefully that was a decent
110:17 - answer to your question let me know if
110:19 - it if it wasn't if you have any
110:21 - follow-up questions Patrick O'Donnell
110:30 - says funny thing about spaghetti code I
110:32 - once did an app like that but it ran in
110:35 - production long after I left the company
110:37 - no one can figure out how to replace it
110:40 - that's that's sure that's the other
110:42 - thing I'm always worried like I want to
110:44 - convert everything I'm doing to react
110:47 - and have like very standard things that
110:48 - we do like coding standard like style
110:53 - standards and and all that so that you
110:56 - know if and when I leave someone could
111:00 - come in and very reasonably like take
111:04 - over everything and figure it out but
111:06 - when I have apps like what we just
111:08 - worked on today I'm not confident that
111:10 - that could happen but I hope this is
111:12 - really the last thing that I built that
111:14 - I need to convert over to kind of our
111:16 - newer organized way of doing things
111:19 - and then I will be at that point where
111:21 - everything is at least somewhat
111:24 - standardized with the accept that kind
111:25 - of Kenko institute site I still need to
111:28 - get some jQuery out of that site but
111:31 - other than that like I'm almost to that
111:33 - point and especially with all these
111:35 - videos there's a video a record now of
111:37 - my thinking so someone could come in and
111:41 - if they really wanted to didn't know
111:43 - something they could go right to the
111:45 - video where we did that and find out
111:47 - about it so I don't want to leave people
111:49 - hanging if I do leave here I'm not like
111:53 - I don't have another job offer for
111:55 - anything right now so I'm not saying I'm
111:56 - gonna leave but I just want to make it
111:58 - easier for the next person if it happens
112:13 - let's see
112:17 - hüseyin says hey dude you have got a
112:20 - nose on your face
112:23 - you're right that's that's definitely
112:27 - true I have one it's right in the middle
112:29 - thank you let's see what are your
112:41 - thoughts on react versus you I don't
112:43 - know I answered a question by view
112:45 - earlier so I'm just gonna stick with
112:46 - that I don't know enough about view to
112:48 - really give you a good answer and
112:49 - reactors a few I will say view seems
112:52 - cool but I don't know that much about it
112:54 - and I really do like react I have fun
112:56 - developing in react David said good
113:01 - advice thank you you're welcome I'm glad
113:03 - that that can help you out a little AK
113:10 - acted to mind there's another cool front
113:12 - end channel okay cool so it's a CA de mi
113:16 - ND awesome thank you for for sharing
113:20 - that
113:29 - we're trying to get the Google
113:32 - Translation so our ten-hour Tim said
113:35 - akka divine is another cool friend
113:36 - Channel so sorry I couldn't say right
113:39 - off the bat it was in where they call it
113:42 - Cyrillic characters Russian I guess so
113:48 - anyway I did the Google Translate
113:49 - hopefully that's that's correct for your
113:51 - name let me know if it's not I'd like to
113:53 - pronounce it correctly if possible
113:55 - Hussein says yes I did an up work it
113:58 - works only get hourly paid jobs with
114:01 - verified payers okay thank you thank you
114:05 - for adding that personal experience as
114:08 - always I think one of the best things to
114:11 - to be able to draw from when you you
114:15 - know when you're considering doing
114:17 - something like up work or even getting
114:19 - with a new company being able to talk to
114:21 - people who've been there or are there
114:22 - that's gives you a lot of good insight
114:28 - on how says Jessie can you mention the
114:31 - name of the freelancer page you have
114:33 - worked I think it was freelancer I think
114:36 - it's called freelancer comm I did that
114:39 - there was another one called thumbtack
114:41 - and freelancer.com I probably made like
114:45 - $15 from total I mean it was it was
114:50 - crazy you're doing work for like I don't
114:53 - know
114:53 - like dollar less than ten dollars an
114:55 - hour sometimes it's just it's it wasn't
114:58 - a good experience and you have to do so
115:01 - much work cheaply to build up your
115:03 - portfolio and get a lot of good reviews
115:05 - it's not worth it thumbtack was a little
115:08 - bit different I think I got one client
115:11 - from thumbtack and maybe made like I
115:16 - don't know $150 total after doing some
115:19 - stuff it was really like didn't make
115:22 - much from it
115:30 - michael says i spent 15 years building
115:35 - casinos around the country and that was
115:37 - the biggest thing I built that that's
115:40 - the feeling I want these days from
115:42 - coding wow that's really cool
115:47 - she went everywhere and build casinos or
115:50 - stuff that's that's cool so were you
115:52 - like construction worker architect or
115:54 - something like you don't have to answer
115:56 - if you don't want to I'm just kind of
115:57 - curious
116:06 - Joshua says hello there watch some of
116:09 - your vids like it so much I subbed right
116:12 - now awesome thank you for subscribing
116:18 - david says since back in JavaScript as
116:20 - possible with node and the like can we
116:22 - skip PHP in those I it's definitely
116:25 - possible to skip PHP and other back-end
116:26 - languages you can pretty much do
116:28 - anything that you need to do with just
116:30 - all JavaScript nowadays so I I know a
116:35 - bit of PHP and a tiny bit of c-sharp and
116:38 - a tiny bit of some other languages but I
116:40 - rarely use them and yeah so it just kind
116:44 - of depends on what you want to do if
116:46 - there's a specific technology you'd like
116:48 - to work with it uses different language
116:49 - then you learn it but if you're not
116:52 - really sure you know if there's no
116:55 - specific technology like let's say if
116:57 - you really want to work with WordPress
116:58 - yeah learn PHP if you don't have
117:00 - anything like that I'd say just stick
117:02 - with JavaScript you know you can
117:04 - front-end back-end for the price of
117:06 - learning one language you can't beat
117:08 - that deal Joshua says by the way is it
117:12 - possible for you to make a C tutorial
117:14 - series or an Android app development
117:16 - tutorial you know what we are gonna do
117:19 - some stuff with react native so it won't
117:21 - be in C or Java or Kotlin or anything
117:24 - like that it'll be in JavaScript but you
117:26 - will be able to build Android and iOS
117:30 - apps with it so we already kind of
117:34 - started a repo for that and I haven't
117:36 - done that many videos with it but I hope
117:38 - to after I'm finished with this current
117:40 - project that we're gonna be working on
117:42 - until probably like the end of February
117:44 - and then hopefully we can switch over
117:47 - and do some more with react native which
117:49 - which is what we'll do the Android iOS
117:51 - stuff with let's see
117:58 - heart says I love react to I am good
118:01 - with front-end stuff now I need to get
118:03 - into back-end what frameworks would you
118:04 - suggest for a back-end EV like Express
118:08 - everybody uses Express with node so like
118:14 - I'm willing for these streams we use a
118:17 - lot of react with Express and node and
118:22 - we build a ton of stuff with that
118:40 - michael says a slot technician kept the
118:42 - machines running along with keeping the
118:45 - accounting systems warm
118:46 - ok cool very cool I have an uncle he
118:49 - used to be a dealer that casinos I so
118:54 - I've never really worked it one before
118:55 - to be honest with you I actually have
118:58 - never like gambled in a casino so don't
119:03 - have a lot of like personal experience
119:05 - with it but I do know I know a few
119:07 - people that have worked at them there's
119:09 - a casino somewhat close to where I live
119:14 - javascript says are you talking what I
119:16 - think you're talking about with react
119:18 - native yeah well definitely so I
119:21 - actually have several projects I want to
119:23 - do with react native but this JavaScript
119:26 - on a AF for sure needs to be done with
119:29 - react native right like people are going
119:31 - to expect to have mobile apps with this
119:35 - this network I think that's that's a
119:37 - given now if you're going to do
119:38 - something like this
119:40 - Mobile is just expected so and since
119:43 - we're doing it with react it won't be
119:45 - too much of a stretch to make it work on
119:48 - with react native there's definitely
119:51 - some some differences in the way you do
119:54 - CSS and things like that
119:56 - the differences in the way you do
119:58 - routing but the logic behind it and
120:01 - grabbing data and things for sure it is
120:07 - going to be pretty much the same
120:15 - alright Gander 7s2 leave a thanks for
120:18 - watching and I think thanks for chatting
120:20 - with us so hopefully I'll see you back
120:24 - here and some other streams later on
120:28 - alright so I'm at the bottom the live
120:30 - chat now I have a few more messages
120:31 - coming in but we'll probably be
120:33 - finishing this in a few minutes here and
120:37 - I've gotten a lot of messages so
120:40 - hopefully I didn't miss anything very
120:41 - important for work I think I'm good I'm
120:46 - duck checking now I think I'm good umm
120:52 - so let me finish up these last few few
120:55 - messages here harsh says okay have you
121:00 - ever tried using blue bird to cancel
121:02 - promises if yes can you make a series on
121:05 - that I have not used blue bird so sorry
121:09 - I've never used blue bird I think I read
121:14 - a tutorial on it or something at some
121:16 - point like a blog post but that's that's
121:18 - all my experience so I wouldn't be
121:20 - comfortable doing a tutorial on it but
121:23 - if anybody knows of a good tutorial with
121:25 - glue bird you know please put in the
121:27 - live chat so to at least have some
121:30 - resources that I can I can give you
121:32 - there Vivek says networking is a good
121:36 - field
121:36 - yeah for sure I actually took some of
121:40 - like the Cisco Networking certifications
121:42 - because I was going to get into
121:43 - networking and then a lot of stuff
121:45 - happened I ended up not getting into it
121:46 - but I I agree let's see
122:00 - vivix says this AI is good or networking
122:02 - for to get a job in the future yeah I
122:05 - think AI is gonna just be like crazy in
122:08 - terms of jobs in the future it's really
122:12 - cool I talked to a developer on
122:14 - Instagram yesterday about it and she was
122:17 - saying like she wants to get into
122:19 - machine learning ai stuff and I'm like
122:21 - I'm gonna be jealous of you when you do
122:24 - because that's that's really cool stuff
122:28 - let's see harsh says like CCNA yeah
122:31 - exactly I was doing the CCNA
122:34 - certifications just like cisco certified
122:36 - network associate or something like that
122:40 - yeah so I went through like they let me
122:43 - break it down and I don't know how they
122:45 - do it now but you took two tests so like
122:46 - halfway through the course you take one
122:48 - test halfway through you take another
122:50 - test you have to pass both of them I
122:51 - passed the first test and then by the
122:53 - time I get to the second test I didn't
122:55 - really want to go into network anymore
122:57 - so I did take the test but I I didn't
123:00 - pass it like honestly I didn't really
123:02 - study it all for it so I I wish I did it
123:06 - was kind of a waste all that time and
123:08 - money to do it so I wish I would have
123:14 - just spent a you know a few hours at
123:16 - least studying and I could have passed
123:17 - it but oh well I like what I'm doing now
123:20 - so I guess it worked out
123:27 - let's see all right I'm gonna wrap
123:31 - things up now this was a great live chat
123:33 - it's a lot of stuff and we covered a lot
123:36 - of different things and we finished what
123:40 - we wanted to get finished and in this
123:43 - old-school jQuery app so hopefully I'll
123:47 - never have to work on this again and I
123:53 - have a few more things coming in cool
123:58 - alright so nope no questions okay is
124:01 - there a schedule for for these chats
124:04 - I've been I'm trying to do the live
124:07 - chats at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time

124:56 - and so until then have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie I'm Jessie and today we were going to do some work with jQuery it's been a while since we've done anything with jQuery but I built a single page application 2016 I worked on it for on and off for the majority of 2016 I think I launched it in October September something like that yeah it had to have been October I think I launched it right around when my youngest daughter was born so she was born at the beginning of October hey everyone see a lot of you the live chat so before we do that I have a few things I want to talk about I'm gonna try to keep it quick and then we can talk more about it later on when we do the question and answer session so first thing is something cool I found this in my basement and this is like my first phone the first one I ever had so it's one of these old Nokia phones with like the clear case that I thought was so awesome I mean it I still think it's awesome you see all the insides and the buttons are worn down you can't see the numbers on some of them so anyway I'm gonna add this to my antique collection which you all can't see so up here so this is my antique collection up here I just have a bunch of like floppy disk beta tapes the copy of Windows XP and I you can't see it but I have an old like CRT like television with a VCR and it so so that's going to be added to the collection and I'm gonna see if I can find a cord that will charge that and I'll get back on it maybe I can look at all my old text messages and see what I was saying when I was a teenager maybe I'll play some snake y'all remember snake all right so that was that was something fun now something serious and then I want to talk about a project that I'm working on and see if anyone's interested in being involved so something serious I know I've talked on the stream before about mental health issues with myself having depression so I just want to like fill you in on what I've been doing and I've been in a much better mood recently so as you may or may not know from previous streams I am going to counseling every month I'm on in two different antidepressants so I'm doing you know basically medically what I should be doing but then in addition to that this is now the tenth day in a row that I have got up early before work and exercise so nothing intense I just go on an exercise bike while I play Zelda on my Nintendo switch and I just go for like half hour 45 minutes just as long as I can before the kids wake up and and then afterwards I may do some pushups or situps if I have time and do a little stretching and I'm not super tired during the day I mean I stay caffeinated right so but I'm not really tired from waking up like this morning I got up at 445 a.m. and I feel fine right now so anyway I just want to share that with you all I know it's pretty common knowledge that exercise helps with your mood and with depression but sometimes it just takes a little push to get going so this is kind of my little push to say hey I've been doing enough for 10 days I feel a whole lot better it was really really hard at first to get out of bed but now that I got into a rhythm I'm waking up early before my alarm the key also is getting the bed on time so I've been taking melatonin at night so that I can go to sleep early enough to make that possible I'm still not sleeping like a lot like seven hours or so like give or take a half hour but you know if I can get eight that's awesome too but anyway so that's just decide bring that up I haven't really talked about mental health issues on the stream for a while and I know you know some of you may be dealing with the same things it's pretty common so just just want to talk about if anyone wants to talk more about that either in the chat or privately you know feel free to reach out to me I've been dealing with it for a long time and sometimes it does help to be able to talk to somebody who's going through the same thing alright so last thing before we get started with the code as you all know if you've been watching the last few streams I purchased the domain name JavaScript AF and we have a forum running on there now that Harshit set up which is awesome thank you harsh it right now it was down because we were trying to transfer it from harsh it's digitalocean account to mine and took a snapshot try to transfer it didn't work so he just sent me another snapshot and we're gonna try to get that up and running so okay I see this hard should I see the snapshot now thank you I guess I'll just get that up and running after the stream so we're going to try to get that up so if you're trying to get to the forum don't worry it's we're working on it it should be up soon after the stream but I've had so javascript err so you can see job it's in the live chat right now Jay ssee RP or JV SC rptr so I'm just gonna say JavaScript I reached out to me on Instagram and had an idea for a website where developers can connect with developers and it would be like like a social media platform but you'd login with your github profile and it could you could voluntarily have a pool data from your github and mix that in so I I kind of envisioned it and and JavaScript you can let you know you know more details as well in terms of like the UI and things and what's going on but the way I envisioned it is it's gonna be place pretty much just for developers right you have to at least have a github account to get in so if if you don't remember Facebook when it first started around like 2004 somewhere around there you had to have a university email and at first like you had to have your university signed up to get an email not not every university was even allowed yet so it was like this niche and it was kind of cool you you had this thing in common so trying to go for that vibe of you know this is a place just for a certain niche so it's it's not we're not trying to recreate Facebook here or Twitter or anything like that they all serve their purpose and what we're trying to do here is just have a place more geared toward developers so the features would be developers for developers for instance like all the github info I think it would be cool I had another suggestion for someone on Twitter and I'm really sorry I can't remember who it was right now but another suggestion was to feature really awesome JavaScript projects from the community so I think that's another thing that we could work in so that made when you go there it's not all about it's not just all about your feed like Facebook or Twitter is there's also like some highlights from the community of really cool things going on maybe some sort of like voting mechanism to be able to see what's what's going in there and and I would I kind of want to exclude like the really big projects everybody knows reacts a big deal you know so we wouldn't want to feature that because I'm sure it would be on top all the time right when you go to look at like github like top projects it's always a lot of the same really big ones so I would kind of want to feature like some more unknown things that are really cool like people doing like VR with JavaScript machine learning like no bus cool stuff so anyway we don't need to have all the features ready right away of course right but the basic features that we'd like to have are you know obviously this is going to be built with react because that's that's what we've been into new most often in terms of backend I'm kind of thinking maybe firebase would be a good fit for authentication and things like that so I don't know let me know what you all think so while you're watching the rest of the stream before we get to the question answer session just think about this think if it's maybe something that you'd like to be involved in in some way or you know what are your ideas in terms of technology was what would work best to have something like this where users sign in with their github obviously they're going to need to be data to stored images stored these things so it if you're familiar with firebase let me know if I'm on the right track here in firebase would be a good fit so I yeah I don't know so this is it's still very open in terms of like architecture like what's what we're gonna already use so I mean something like firebase just comes with so many things built in to help us expand so that's why I'm kind of mentioning that but I haven't worked with it personally I've just kind of watched videos on it all right so anyway right now JavaScript er is working on UI stuff so basically just making kind of an interactive prototype with just straight HTML like CSS stuff well eventually once we get that to where like we like it we can convert it to react components so that's that's where we're going now javascript ER has a repo for the UI up now so I guess we could share info about that I'll maybe I'll get a repo going for like the react version of it and so we could have like one official place we can maybe do some have some issues ready if you want to help with it so I am I'm going to kind of stop the conversation on it now so we can get to the get to the code but then we'll pick up with it and you know so feel free to type whatever you think about this project and please be honest if you think it's a terrible idea let me know if you if you have ideas for features or whatever please let me know and we can discuss it in the question answer session I'm probably not going to talk about it all the time on the stream for two reasons one this is free code camp stream we mainly deal with nonprofits this could eventually end up being a forprofit thing if it's big I could see maybe companies wanting to advertise jobs I wouldn't want it to get crazy like a lot of social media now there's so many sponsored posts and things I don't want it to be like that but you know potentially there could be something like some something at some point so I don't want to bring that into the we can't Channel also I am streaming from work and I'd like to work on my work project so I don't want to spend a lot of my work time doing this so if you have questions please feel free to ask me I'll take a minute or two in the live chat everyday to talk if you have a question otherwise just you know send me a message on any of the social media things or whatever and we can kind of organize this and and get this going okay also javascript is in the live chat now so if you want to keep the conversation going just send a message you know just tag JavaScript or in the live chat okay all right so let me introduce you to this old jQuery project that I that I built so I we we worked a little bit on a react version of this project this is the the bulletin right the university of oulu team that we had worked on and i did some updates to it yesterday i added so we had that email authentication where you could do the password list link sent to your email i've added another way to go into the app and we talked about this yesterday a bit where basically if you're able to log into the university single signon system and get to that password protected area and then you click the link from there you can get directly into the bulletin without having to go through the normal login process but the problem now is before we automatically had a user's email because they had to put their email in to login and so I had a form on there that a user could fill out and I didn't have an email field because we just grabbed the email automatically now we need to add an email field in and we need to change up a little bit about how we're sending that data to make sure that the emails are going where they they need to go so let's dig into there let's let's kind of like try to straighten out my spaghetti code jQuery this hopefully will be a good example of why you I really don't want to try to make a singlepage app and handle routing and everything with jQuery because it starts out small and then you add new features in all the sudden there's a lot there so let's start out and let's run this so this is running on gulp so haven't used go up in a while I don't know how many of you remember using gulp or still use go I mean if I'm not doing the react projects I'd probably go with gulp or maybe just like NPM scripts or something but so I think it's gulp watch let's see oops let me bring my screen up here there we are yeah so I just did a gulp watch and this brought up our bulletin now I'm gonna have to login so here's the the normal login and this is done with a service called auth0 so I'm just using the free plan for auth0 the university is not very big so the free plan is sufficient and I'm sending the emails for the authentication through SendGrid so the free plan on Austria and SendGrid are kind of what's behind this current system eventually we'll get rid of this system when we switch over to the react version that heart should set up a password the system without the use of Ozzy row which is awesome so let me check my email now and get the code there we go that's great all right so now I'm in so what's happened is the user information is not saved in local storage in the browser so as long as I don't clear your local storage then this will stay login for a year at least that's the plan some users have been having issues where their local storage is getting cleared and there's no apparent reason why so that was the other day there yesterday or the day before or I think I had someone come in for some troubleshooting and that was exactly the issue they were getting logged out and we could not figure out why all right so let's go to this submit announcement form so this is what we're going to be changing we just need to add one more field and that's for email and we probably could now that I look at it you I was it might make more sense visually to move this file up load up here in this corner so we would have email the file upload and then the announcement fullwidth down here write the announcement generally tends to be a lot longer it wouldn't make sense that will fool with email except on on small screens all right so that's what we're that's what we're gonna do so let's check the code and let me just duplicate this tab and we're gonna go into visual studio code I don't think I have this open anywhere maybe I did oh well okay so this was our password we don't need this this is where I'm handling the login our app baliya so all the code is informs AAS now unfortunately this code is in a private repo so you won't be able to to follow along I just saw the live chat Harshit said has to go because something came up thanks so much are for for all your help with the forum earlier and hopefully everything's alright nikki has to go to see it thanks for watching let's I also should mention we had some more pool requests come in and we will go over that and review that probably tomorrow I'd like to get back to our main project that francisc and main website that we've been working on tomorrow and then continue to just work on that project until we launch it in February late February alright so let's check out what we have this controls the modal and we have different models that show up whether the message is successful or not we're also going to need to go to the index page so let me split this this screen so we can have the HTML on one place and I believe it's all the way at the bottom here here we are let me know if that font is too small so we can see we have this this text area for announcement what we want to do is make an input so I'm going to I'm gonna take this and copy it and we're gonna need yeah we're gonna need to rearrange this a bit but first how that indentation is crazy there we are so we're get definitely going to change this we don't want the the edit icon so let's see I'm not sure if there's an icon called email but it's worth a shot and we want to change this we obviously don't need a text area so let's change this to an input and we can give it a type of email we want to change the ID to email and he relies inputs I think that class will be fine and we want to change this to an input and the label now is going to be for email and we're going to change this to email all right so now we're pulling in email are we we have a field for email and let's bring up this file upload whoops and you know what I forgot to put this in its own I mess this up a bit alright let's bring this down here and let's put it in a div we are using materialized CSS so that's where these column classes are coming from class it's so weird to not type class name since we're used to doing react but we can use class and let's call let's make this a column and we want it to be in small screens we want to make it full width so 12 out of 12 columns and then on medium screens and up we want it to be half the width so 6 out of 12 columns and now we can paste in our new input and then we also want to bring in this file upload input so let's grab make sure it'll grab too much class for every checkbox okay I believe we have everything and we're gonna put this right here underneath and we're gonna also need to change our column classes as well so we had the column that was oops did I put this in the wrong spot I think I did let's move that okay now in the right spot so we just need to add on on medium screen so we want this to take up half the width all right now let's check out how this looks and then we can go back to our our code let's move this around so you don't want to go too far all right let's check this all right okay not not too bad so we have our email and you know what the this is not aligned correctly we have to check on this alignment why we're having an issue here but other than the alignment issue this looks fine I do want to make sure we're setting a good breakpoint here so let's see if at any point it looks too small I think it's fine I mean it's getting a little narrow there but that's that's still reasonable all right all right not bad let's see if we can figure out from the markup with this this issue is beat with the spacing with these icons and an easy fix if we can't figure it out would just be to remove the icons which I'm okay with doing that basically the reason being this is a really low level update that needs to happen so I am I'm not that worried about you whether or not there's an icon there all right so we have this row and everything is wrapped in one row okay call them class the field callers okay it's a column you know what let's try to put though we do have this oops what did we do you know what I added another column there I did not even realize that I added an extra column alright so if anybody caught that and was really confused that's why I added an extra column where I didn't really need one let's check this up now hopefully that corrected it yep and that corrected it now these are lined up properly I'm not thrilled about how far up this is with the email but I'm willing to live with it right now whoa hahaha I didn't even notice this alright I probably just forgot an ending div here somewhere so let's check out our divs oops there we are I have too many divs here we are all right that's acceptable I'm honestly this is not the bestlooking thing I've ever built but right now this needs to be done like today like this morning it needs to be done so I'm okay with it also the fact that we're going to replace this entire thing with something new sometime within the next six months like I'm alright with with this this is a feature used by I don't know maybe a dozen people on campus so it just doesn't make sense to spend a whole lot of time nitpicking the details of this UI alright so now let's make sure that that email gets in to our forms J s file so let's see how how we're getting this data so we can move this over because we won't really need this just mark up for a little while let me see I'm gonna check my time in about five minutes I'm gonna take a fiveminute break and I'm gonna go to the live shot here and answer some questions I don't want to get too far behind with the live chat so if you're asking questions you're wondering why I'm not reading your comments or questions I usually go back and forth between code and questions for a certain amount of time so I do code for about 25 minutes then I go back to the question and then at the end I'll just do a big question answer session and get through everything so if you can just hold on and you'll hang out in a live chat I'll get your question if you can't stick around you can always catch the recording of this later on and I'll answer your question you know whether you're here or not and and then it'll be recorded for you to to check out whenever you have time alright so let's see so a little bit about what's going on here maybe if you're not that familiar with jQuery this looks weird if you are familiar with jQuery this is pretty standard so we're just kidding so we're binding the submit event of our form so this is the idea is the announcement submit form and on click we're going to do something so we've passed in the events we have access to that the first thing we're going to do is check the length of our hidden checkbox so this is our security on the form right so I don't even know if this still works anymore but the idea at one point was like if a bot is trying to fill out your form like a spam bot then they they would check the hidden checkbox because they would see it in the markup but a real person would never see it and check it so so if the hidden checkbox is checked then you don't actually send the data right so that's where we're checking there so first thing we're if there's a request going we abort that request and oh man I'm seeing lots of variables here instead of constants Wow so here's our form container and we're just saving that to a variable so from now on dollar sign form is our form and we don't have to keep writing this selector anymore so we're going to get the inputs from form so we're finding all the possible inputs in that form so we're getting any element that is an input a select a button or a text area and then we're initializing some variables here for name value and iterator and then a checkbox we're grabbing the form elements let's see find on input type checkbox' all right so this is getting inputs but we're excluding some things we're excluding checkboxes we don't want the hidden one we're excluding the file type input and we're also grabbing uploads like remembering this as I go along so and remember it was nearly two years ago that I wrote this so be kind as you look upon my spaghetti code alright so we're going to serialize the data and so here's what we need to change right now we're checking local stores the profile that we have saved after someone logs in for the email we don't want to do that anymore we want to grab the email from that form data all right so let's see what the best way would be to change this we are okay I forgot I'm sending this all to a Google sheet and then from there from the Google sheet the email is being sent okay so I don't actually have any code that handles emails all right sometimes it helps to just look at your code even if you wrote it all right I gotta take a break for just a second because it is super hot in my office I'm gonna take off my sweater and then get back to it actually it's a bin all right it's been five minutes so I'm gonna take on my sweater and then we're going to I'm gonna go to the live chat answer some questions read some comments and then we'll come back and we'll grab that email from our new email input and that should be it there's one other place in the bulletin where there's a typo so maybe we can find that and fix it and then we can push all this to production and hope hopefully it all works all right I'm gonna scroll all the way to the top of the live chat sorry if I seem a little bit distracted for some reason like all these songs that I don't like keep playing on Spotify it's just bothering they think and then I keep switching them maybe I should just switch playlists alright there we are switch playing this should be a lot better all right rook or Nicki says oldschool app made in 2016 sounds about right front end moves so quickly yeah for sure see it's a lot of you saying hi I'm just I'm just to collectively say hi to everyone there's a lot of people in here they're nice that's crazy so old haven ich if you're still there I didn't see you at the beginning there but thanks for watching AHA John Hanson says hey all what jQuery Hank it's just kidding all right so Mari Marius let me know if I'm not pronouncing that correctly the Marius says up when the Mario says had depression too and help get out of it through exercise also says I'm so glad you're doing better talking about it it's a good move too too much stigma around discussing depression yeah I do want to say too with depression I've fallen into the trap before of thinking like hey I'm cured of depression and like stopping my medication and just stopping doing all these things that helped me and then I would fall back into it and it would take me a long time to get back out of it and you know get back to you know doing the things that helped me out so I'm gonna try my best not to fall into that again I'm gonna continue with my counseling my medication my exercise to be honest with you the counseling the medication or way easier than exercise for me like taking a pill not a big deal I'm going to go talk to somebody for you know an hour a month not really a big deal my counsellor is great I always feel like a million bucks after I leave counselling so the exercise would be the hardest but I just want to let you all know that that for me at least depression has never been a thing that I could just like say wow I'm cured it's gone it always comes back sometimes it takes longer than others but you know if you're in that place you know don't don't feel bad about I think that's just kind of the nature of some types of depression med asks why did you get depressed in the first place I don't really know you know why it was it's not like an event happened really that made me really depressed it's more like well as far as my doctors say it's more like a chemical imbalance like there's you know serotonin and different things in your brain that regulate your mood and my brain is not producing enough of that and certain things can help you get more like exercise or medications so that's that's where I'm at right now just trying to get back to like normal levels of you know whatever chemicals in my brain I'm supposed to have they're all right hey I have some of you are typing in Russian normally I would put that in Google Translate but I'm gonna go ahead because we just we have so many comments now that I'm not gonna do it right now maybe I'll do it later on though so apologies for that alright it looks like a lot of you thought that it was a really good idea to have that this whole website that we're thinking of doing with JavaScript AF kind of the a place for developers to showcase their work and encourage each other Jordan asked for links to tutorial videos Jordan let me know what tutorial videos you're talking about because I'm not 100% sure maybe I missed something in the chat or maybe I missed something I'm not sure what I was talking about there so let me know if you mean any of the doriel videos that I've done on my channel which I don't have that many videos yet but the link should be in the description to this to this video Oh horseshit I know you're not here anymore hardship but hard said might kill the forum thing it's getting useless I'm I don't I wouldn't kill the forum right away I think it's a good thing and I think I would rather not kill it but maybe move it to a subdomain and I don't know you won't let me know what would you think but I thought the forum was really cool a cool idea alright so it's been about five minutes I'm going to go back to the code and try to finish this up I'll come back to I left off in the live chat after we finish this I'll see Sebastian's in the stream and I haven't seen Sebastian for a long time so hey Sebastian how's it going welcome back I'm really happy to see you alright so let's see and I just realized I haven't been using the Pomodoro timer so let me bring this over this is the one that I think this is the one Harsha built yeah so let's set this timer that way I don't have to keep watching the clock and let's grab let's see if we can grab our email so we're bringing this data in we're grabbing these inputs and we're finding this funny funny I'm not sure what format we have this in so I want to see I'm gonna do a console log and I want to see what these form elements are let's check it out let's put something in here autofill some stuff and submit and inspect it see what we get dev tools popped up on that other screen and it's this one announcement text email says good let's make sure I don't have any more console logs in here it's possible console logging several things what one of 19 I seriously have 19 console logs whoa all right let's get rid of a lot of these console logs what was I thinking 19 console logs all right I'm okay with with console logging this stuff for now all right I have some well I have a lot of stuff that's just commented out it's always crazy to go back and look at my old coat and just say what was I thinking all right so let's go I want to make sure I know which console.log this is so this is some es6 template literal syntax so I use those back ticks and then everything in here is a string unless I put it in with within brackets starting with the dollar sign and then this is JavaScript so now I'll save that and I'm gonna bring this over here make it bigger so it's actually readable for you all let's clear this out and now I'll put my email back in and submit the air we are sisters look at this object object okay cool so we have an object alright I was hoping that we would have an object wonderful alright let's go over here so what I should be able to do is just grab that value let's get rid of this when we get that email oh I see so we are let's take this out of here so we're just going to define email here so it's still available in the scope that we need it but then within this function where we're serializing then I'm going to go here and say if name equals oops I need parentheses so if name equals email then we're going to set email equal to the value all right so now since we defined email here even though we're inside this this loop here we're gonna give email this value and then now we don't have to change anything else because anywhere that we're using the email variable down here it's just gonna pull this value so could we possibly refactor and make it a little bit nicer probably but as I said a few minutes ago this this particular update does not justify spending any more time than we absolutely have to and we're going to replace all the code sometime within the next a few months or so okay so now let's try it out so I'm submitting it it says it's been since although the result says error email invalid email I should let's clear it and then try it again I I'm not sure if that was from this time or the last time all right so in I'm getting an error and a success well the only way to be sure is to check my email so I do got my email open on my other screen and let's see where I should be getting an email at my gmail account and another email at my work account okay all right so we have an issue so right now it's coming through the message is coming through as test but the email is coming through is undefined so let's see what value were actually getting here now there's two ways that we could troubleshoot this right there's multiple ways so we could go in dev tools and check out the value of this or we could console.log console.log would probably be faster at this point but I would like to show you another way that we could we could get this so I don't usually do it this way but it is it can be really useful so let's check out our sources and Wow so many things well how do I have so many sources you know these are all my there we are alright so let's go to our forms and let's check out email so let's put in break right there so let's redo this and now we're gonna go to submit announcement and we'll put the email in or submit and we have a break point now right so I've added the break point so the code stops right here and I can check it says all right the email name equals no space all right so this looks kind of weird our serialized form elements end up being email equals Jessie why go at gmail.com and undefined equals and announcements that so we're doing something wrong let's figure out what we're doing wrong here where are we getting that undefined from you know what I believe we're adding we do need to do some stuff down here I think yeah we do all right let's go back to the code I was a little bit let's see all right King Darcy's one of C's my mistake hahaha good look good look at that good catch those equals all right thank you for catching that you all are great on that you always catch it before me so yeah I was using a comparison instead of assignment right so I was using the three equal signs instead of one so that's that's good but then I also remembered that with the serialized data why am i serializing the form elements and then making the serialized data am I even using the serialize form elements anymore I want to see what I'm doing with these one two three I'm not even using these all right I'm gonna leave it alone this definitely needs refactored there's stuff I'm not even using and we'll leave it alone but it should it should work all right let's see I think that I pulled this code from another project where I did need this and I just left it in there never took it out let's see all right when you refresh it should have refreshed I don't know what oh let me take this up and let me make sure I saved it there we are now let's give it another try all right yay all right wonderful I've received the confirmation so I received a notification at my work email that someone submitted a bulletin and then I received a notification at my personal email that my submission was received awesome very awesome all right cool okay so it works so the let's let me check my timer whoops all right so I have about ten minutes left at this point I want to very quickly find the typos that I had which a coworker of mine found it so I'm going to go to my slack messages and look at that again okay great on the bulletin help page okay so it's on the help page which listen help I don't even remember what the help page is is it okay it's a separate it's a totally separate page okay let's see hopefully I actually have it in here but it will be suppose the dist index hmm help all right so have a whole nother folder that's for help let's look at the index and see what we can do all right so it says experience is misspelled expe r IE n c e h PE r IE NC all right cool let's just well that's too much let me make sure I'm not using it anywhere else expe o the end all right so that's not coming up at all good alright so that is ready I do have a dist folder let me see strength Inc how I got this help alright so help is included in the dist so I have this set up that I can just use gulp dist to make this ready but the last time I tried to run this it didn't actually do what it needed to do to all the proper file so I'm gonna go into dis now and make sure that we have changes in the proper file so it should be index and then that forms dot J s and we also need to have index dot HTML within help change as well so we're in the dist folder it looks like help did not change so we're gonna I just I'm just going to manually pull this over for now you can see like all the little places where things just did not get it it's just not good there's just little manual things that need to be done the build steps are just aren't good like compare that to something like using create react app and having all that done for you and and it's consistent it's reliable it's just a huge difference alright not that you couldn't do that in an app like this but it's not like it's not like I had an allinone like this is going to do everything I wanted to solution alright so that's there we can close up this help and our index dot HTML and I have great okay so check our status just to doublecheck at this distance awesome now the next step is let's do a commit let's say an email field to Miss submission form and we're gonna push that up to get up so again I apologize this is a private repo so you can't see the changes and then now I'm going to do fly production so I'm using an NPM module called flight plan which basically goes into your server and copies over your files into the right folder and it's really fast so that's it that should be working I'm going to double check by going to the bullets in the live version and actually let me bring this up on my screen No oh let's see all right so it's not working now but this would be a good test so this is the new login system the new possible way to log in that I'm going to test right now I tested it yesterday but can't hurt to test it again so now I've logged into our the university's single signon system that they call access fus I clicked University bulletin we just saw a second ago I was not logged in I click that and now I have access to the bulletin but there is no login info saved for me but if I go to submit announcement no no did not go there maybe there's some cat there we go it was just caching all right cool so now I have the email files let's do a live test of this and submit submission has been sent let's check my email to verify yes I just got verifications on Gmail and on my work account wonderful all right cool so everything worked out today maybe I'm better with jQuery than I am with react usually I break something with react oh wow so hopefully I I was trying to do a couple of things with this stream like other than just my normal like watch me at work you know type of thing and that was show an example of how I used to do things and kind of like hopefully see how far I've come and and really not that much time and also show an example of how things can just get really out of control when you try to like hand code everything and not use something like react or angular or your view to structure your it's possible I met all the user requirements with this it works it's reliable but it's it's kind of hard to maintain there's not really that much of a logic to it until I go back in and just look at what I've done so anyway I hopefully that was like somewhat evident to you all hopefully I don't have to go back in and mess with this very for very much longer and we get that react version going so with the time we have left which is only three minutes so I'm not going to do any more code now I'm going to go back to the live chat and I'm going to answer all your questions read out comments and so anything that you want to talk about put it in the live chat let's scroll up okay Zuber says no fireplace please instead use Postgres alright so Zubair if you're still there let me know why you don't think firebase would be a good fit for this Anne Hale says MongoDB we can definitely look into using for sure oh okay hard mate that's right okay so I don't I don't know if our should still here or not the Harsha did make that chat app with firebase so I'm not sure if he shared that with everyone in the live chat but I I remember logging into that before so that's awesome so since Harshit is already familiar with firebase that might be a good way to go though just to save the time of having to learn something else Anoop says horseshit you're pumped up yeah hard should it always has a lot of enthusiasm I really love that about Harshit and he has the skills to back it up so Nicky says firebase is pretty easy to use but apparently gets expensive when your site gets popular all right I can see that but I wonder is it more expensive if your site at really popular is it more expensive to use firebase or would it be more expensive to try to do the same thing by scaling like manually scaling up servers and handling all that so ideally if our site they'd get popular we would either get some funding from investors or donations or let's say advertising or you know probably like job listing types types of things I think a job listing would be the most useful kind of advertising for developers because developers probably are looking for a job or at least would like to see what's out there if we start if we did would do advertisements for products I mean it could possibly be useful but I could see that becoming a little bit I don't kind of more annoying that's just me I don't let me know what you all think on how us if there was a repo of the project that I was talking about and this is that JavaScript AF project we're talking about the beginning I haven't made a repo yet JavaScript there made a repo that's just gonna be like a static HTML site just to kind of get the layout done which i think is a great idea because it at least for me a lot of times a static HTML site is just so much easier to to do things in to make like UI changes you don't really need to add all that other stuff that comes with building out react you don't need you know at that point once we're you know pretty satisfied with the UI then we can always start making that UI in react kind of like how we did for cat a chemical Institute but we're gonna do a better job of it guitar says M lab is free check it out I think we've worked with M lab in the in the past on houses MongoDB Atlas has a free version cool thank you for all the the suggestions here I really appreciate this ambition says do you code on the weekends sometimes it depends I really I try to save the weekends for hanging out with my family but when I was doing the Udacity react nanodegree I I coded on the weekends when I have a client on the side I code on the weekends so it just depends on what's going on right now my wife is doing she she's doing to like boot camp programs at once so she's gonna Udacity nano degree and she was doing the flat iron boot camp at the same time so the weekends like she needed all the time on the weekend to do that she just graduated from Flatirons boot camp so maybe she won't need as much time we'll see so right now I'm doing little Cody on the weekends but that sometimes I do a lot it just depends Zuber asked if javascript err and hard username used by the same person oh no no it's dude JavaScript and harshin or two different people michael said just got here and i think i really missed the most important part of the chat all right Michael if you're still there I guess just go back and watch their recording I don't sorry I'm gonna need a drink after fit and I can't get rid of mic off it's not nearly as bad as it was the last week but it's like still there let's see I lost my place here Stephen s if if we're gonna cry when we see this meaning my jQuery mess Alexis's jQuery is still used to s go yeah yeah I know it's definitely still still used Stephen says Jessi's confidence level is scaring me today I'm not sure what you made does it seem like I have a lot of confidence today or not a lot of confidence it feels like I'm the normal amount but I don't know and is that a good thing or a bad thing if I'm more or less confident Zuber says think about parcel jazz okay I haven't heard about parcel jazz Siraj says parcel is the new build tools oh okay and Mayer says partially I'm loving alright wow I'm totally like out of the loop here I didn't know that I don't remember parcel Jess at all I'll definitely have to check that up the JavaScript just says if you want to talk more about the project you can DM me on insta yeah me as well you know there's a variety of ways to get in touch with me so whatever way is most comfortable to you you know just let me know email Twitter LinkedIn Facebook one of the Instagram any of the social media stuff I'm on just you know message me all right Michael Chris has defined spaghetti yes so when I say spaghetti code usually it's just like to me I don't know if there's an official definition right like it's it's just kind of like a term that people use to describe code that's kind of like gotten out of control out of order it's it's not separated out logically so that was that's what tends to happen on some projects that were you either and it doesn't you don't have to use jQuery for to turn out a spaghetti code you could be using vanilla JavaScript you custom make everything like the routing and all that which is great and it could be really clean at first when it's small but then you come back in later on and sometimes you have to add a feature here there it doesn't scale well you end up just adding on pieces of code sometimes you don't remove old pieces because you need it for this one thing and then later on you may not need it anymore but you don't remember that you don't need it so like I went back in and found a variable that I I wasn't using at all so evidently when I was working through that I left it in there for a reason and then forgot to take it out so that's kind of what I mean by spaghetti code it's all jumbled up like spaghetti and it's hard to take it apart right it's hard to just take like one strand of spaghetti and separate at all you know with before you had to stick your fork in and do that it's hard so in the same way it's hard to just separate out parts of your code like you could and react right like in react you have your component if you do it right you know you could remove that component and pop it in another project and with minimal changes or sometimes no changes it can work hopefully that makes sense let me know if it doesn't or let me know if I'm wrong about spaghetti code it means something totally different than I think it means see Gander 7 says I watch from work and couldn't pay attention because of Ward discussion when you were pitching an app idea at the beginning could you recap if you figure out what I'm asking yeah sure Gander 7 I mean the best recap is going to be just to watch the the replay but just a very short recap is it's going to be a website where developers can have a profile on there where it'll just you'll sign in with github it can pull data from about your repos and things and you can share projects you're working on and talk with other developers and it could be a place to you know highlight your work I'm kind of hoping that it would end up being a place where the focus is mainly on projects especially maybe smaller more obscure projects that are really cool the people working on to kind of bring it to the community and you know get some more exposure for that and also a place where I mean let's face it like a lot of the other social media places they're all this other stuff aside from coding right so it would be nice to have a place to go where the focus is mainly just you know coding and developer related stuff and not necessarily you know other stuff that's going on in the world there's it's important to talk about other things but sometimes you don't want all that other distraction around so this will like be purposely focused on one group just developers and only on topics that relate to to developers on Hill says we can open an issue with the subject about this project or JavaScript er you can write the description of the project in the readme of the repo yeah that's actually a great idea thanks for that I know we should definitely just explain everything and have it there for everyone to see old sauce says why is jQuery so bad where is where it's best use and where you don't have to use it all right so yeah I guess I don't want to give the impression that jQuery is terrible to use because I think some people it seems like they believe that but I really don't believe that I think jQuery has its place I will say this if you're working with react you should probably not use jQuery because any Dom manipulation with jQuery is going to circumvent reacts you know the component lifecycle so you're not going to get that you're not going to trigger a rerender with within react you really should do everything like that within state so try to avoid it with react but if you had a project that was not react based than you wanted to add some jQuery stuff it could be a very helpful library can help you do more in less time than if you try to do it all which is vanilla JavaScript jQuery can be very helpful especially for beginners we're just trying to get started and get a feel for doing things I mean yes I think we can all agree that learning to do things the vanilla JavaScript way and the long run is very good for a developer but sometimes newer developers need to have some successes and need to be able to build cool things early on to keep their spirits up and to make it through this you know we all know there's ups and downs you gotta have some thing to look back on to say wow I did that to get you through those Downs I think jQuery you can very very quickly be able to make some cool things also you know people talk a lot about how it's bad that jQuery is this big library you bring in and sometimes you only use a tiny piece of that library well the fact is that most sites on the internet use jQuery so the odds that somebody already has that you know cache somewhere especially if you use a CDN are pretty good so the the cost of that size of you know jQuery is really mitigated by that so all in all I I'm not if you use jQuery I'm not at all trying to say you're bad develop or anything obviously I've used a lot of jQuery on projects I even usually carry on a project within the last year that we completed so I will say this in terms of just don't use it if you don't have to if you only need to use a little bit of jQuery it might be worth it to look up how to do it with another JavaScript yeah so that's my take on it if you disagree please let me know in the live chat or if you agree but have something to add to that please let me know see started then this is hello from Russia hey how's it going thanks for joining us no my AB said is that visual code on Linux on houses Syed yes I use it on the moon too yes it is available on on Linux yeah Dennis wants to see my plugins for Visual Studio code sure let's view extensions alright here's what I have let me get rid of these it's not gonna let me alright so here's what I have now most of these extensions can be added if you just get the react foodtruck extension react foodtruck will automatically add a bunch of these in but if you do that I highly recommend that you disable import cost because it uses a lot of resources on your machine and it caused me to drop a lot of frames in my streams Harshit said it either crashed or almost crashed his computer so yeah so just be aware of that if you end up getting react foodtruck so all I guess I'll just scroll slowly through this and then if you want if you need to pause on one of them just you know what you can pause the video or go back and watch the recording javascript or says I hate depression I suffer from it as well as anxiety yeah yeah for sure the anxiety occasionally I have trouble with anxiety but I've been it's been good I used to have panic attacks but it's been years since I had a panic attack and I really like I'm a lot better with that John Henson says about jQuery the jQuery is not bad though it does not run natively inside a browser therefore a library needs to be running inside browser in order for it to call the JavaScript so there's data overhead that is that's well said so I definitely agree with that his access I went through a two Oh Peter says Visual Studio code is also available on Debian and Red Hat Patrick says Patrick O'Donnell says hey walking 20 minutes a day is all the exercise you probably need it or wonders good luck cool yeah actually I've heard that my wife was telling me that she read that I don't actually need to exercise for that long to get the the mental benefits so I'm gonna keep that in mind but so I made a room for myself that if I'm exercising on the exercise bike I get to play the Nintendo switch so it's incentive for me to play otherwise my kids always want to play and it's like I just don't get to so I kind of want to keep exercising for 45 minutes because you can't get that much done in 20 minutes right but anyway I'll keep that in mind because sometimes if I didn't get my full 45 minutes in I would feel bad about it which is I didn't want to feel about I'm exercising so I can feel better so I'll keep in mind that I really don't need that 45 minutes and that's just extra I think you know that that'll mentally that'll be better for me Dennis said I can translate from Russian if you need oh cool cool thank you Blake says why the dot af you know the UM alright I could say okay Michael criolla explain that all right thanks thanks for Michael yeah I just got the domain name is kind of like a joke cuz I thought it would be like it'd just be cool to have I wasn't sure what I would do with it so that's why I got it I just it like I realized that dot AF names were thing and you could actually get it it's the Afghanistan like code so I immediately just started typing things in to see if they were available and JavaScript was one of the first ones I tagged in it was available so I got it JavaScript er says I'm getting a lot of good feedback from it awesome my AB says yep I found a flat pack for Visual Studio code cool I'm not sure I don't know what flat pack does let me know Sebastian says quick TL TL DR so too long didn't read on the JavaScript thing happens haven't been seeing the stream in a while yeah well hopefully you've you're still on and you've heard me explain it a couple times so let me know if you need some more explanation though but I think we've got over a couple times down Sebastian says hey I've been working hard I have this week off so I'm catching around awesome well enjoy your week off I'm glad you decided to spend some of it here with us Oh Alexi said the chat has been buggy is anyone else having a problem with the chat it seemed okay for me but I wasn't really in it a lot I was on my other screen Sebastian says get a dot tk1 it's free and more popular what's the dot tk1 am i missing the the joke with a dot CK domain Aleksey says da da f domains are expensive where can I get that domain cheap I don't really know it was kind of expensive it's more than I've ever paid for a domains oh it was like an impulse buy I was like oh this I just have to do it so I don't I don't know if you can get a cheaper I didn't find it anywhere cheaper Michael says between yesterday's group chat and now today's look at your spaghetti I'm feeling better about the code block I'm experiencing all right well I'm glad I mean I always say this if I want you all to see when I mess things up because I think it is important to see other developers messing things up trying to work through it especially messing up just simple things like I messed up and put three equal signs instead of one equal sign right like especially for developers who work alone or freelance or something like it's easy to get the idea from social media from other YouTube videos that there's all these developers out there that are awesome and the don't make as many mistakes as you do but that's not the case at least I think it's not the case because I make a lot of mistakes show so I just kind of wanted to share that right because we we don't naturally want to show our mistakes right we want to post a selfie online and we take 50 selfies and post the best one right we don't post normally all the worst ones right it's the same way with our code right we don't post our terrible code and we don't post to you know talk about how much how the crazy ridiculous simple mistakes we made so anyway my point is that I'm glad that it was working out that way for you Michael Oh Michael said by the way the in the days remaining give is making my OCD kicking super hard these remaining I don't know where that div is alright let me get rid of these extensions I kind of want to see this this day let's see I don't even know where I have these remaining on here oh whoa let's see I lost my place sorry sometimes the chat just Scrolls down all the way to the bottom King Dhara aha so King Ghidorah kept pointing out my mistake with the equal signs he said I was going crazy over here I know sorry it took me so long to look over I just I always forget that you all probably see it before I do and I should have just looked at the teachers I didn't realize that I had a mistake for a while though anyways david says Jessie you remember our venerable code opulent and imperial gazing proudly from its stoic perch above the page alright that's a different one today David I'm wondering so David is that a quote from something because I don't I don't really know what it's from anyway let me know all right so javascript is made an issue in the github repo on on javascript or github account where we can all discuss the project max put a like a sleeping emoji so I don't know what I was doing at that time in the stream but it must have been boring sorry max King Doris says the reason I'm not a fan of firebase is because it feels dirty to put all of the backend data management logic in the client does that matter maybe I'm using it wrong I don't really know King Ghidorah I like I said the only thing I've seen about firebase is from YouTube videos I haven't actually used it yet I'm gonna have to talk to some people that have used it I know hard has enough to talk more with hardship and maybe I'll just try to you know reach out to people to see if someone can fill me in on the pros and cons of using it King Doris's and I know firebase functions are a thing but I haven't heard much about them yeah I haven't heard anything about them either Jordan says go server list with AWS yeah I'm like it I'm open for any suggestions on this right now I just threw out firebase kind of to kind of get things started get the discussion started but the way I look at different technologies is you have your user stories you know what you want to accomplish now find the technology that will accomplish that the best way the quickest way the cheapest way what you know whatever you needed to do find what's going to get that done for you so I'm not tied to any one technology it would be nice to use something that I'm familiar with there'd be less learning involved for me I'm not opposed to learning but I just know like I'm realistic with my time to know if you know I might not it might take a lot longer if I have to learn something new before I can help out on this project Michael Chris has no ads please no ads JavaScript er says yeah no ads trust me that Lexi said ads aren't bad take a look at carbonize yeah I I don't want to put ads on there like I said the only thing they even remotely close to ads that I'd be okay with or job postings because to me like that's that's helpful to developers right when you go on Stack Overflow you see the job postings on the side that never annoys me I'm I think it's I'd like to see like oh yeah what jobs are out there what are they asking for what are the titles even if I'm not looking for a job it's still nice to stay up to date on that so that's what I'm talking about I really would like to stay away from ads if possible I mean but all like realistically at some point if it gets really big in the cost for servers and everything is really high something's gonna have to happen it doesn't have to be ads but something needs to happen so that can be paid for I am NOT independently wealthy so either like Bitcoin has to get to a million dollars or I have to win the lottery or we got to find some other way to this before tea michael says the customers who would come to the site have a adblockers install so it would be a waste of time to set them up it could be I don't really mind ads that sometimes it's useful if they give me like targeted ads based on my interests sometimes I see it I'm like oh yeah I did want that thing Alexi says I guess it depends on the person I whitelist pages that I want to support I also whitelist youtubers I'll export oh that's a good idea I never thought about that but I don't run an ad blocker on my regular browser I do have it on one of my browsers but that is a really good idea about whitelist things to support the site's you do work I like that Mikael says hi what are you building in this particular stream I was building I was doing some updates on a jQuery single page application that I had built two years ago and I was just adding in a new field to a form and connecting that up with we were sending it to a Google sheet and then that would be emailed from there Oh Mykel creo sorry Michael so I thought Michael had asked me to define spaghetti codes spaghetti code but he actually said definitely spaghetti sorry I went through that whole explanation Michael also says believe me I know what spaghetti code is I have a pasta master so sorry about that Michael well maybe somebody out there didn't know what it was so hopefully that was useful to someone Michael said Jessie developers need their ups and downs to make the ups feel better me you're preaching to the crowd okay so quote quoting me and then he says me you're preaching to the crowd brother yeah I mean yeah that's just how it is that's I think just the nature of it that you you get sometimes you feel amazing you build something really cool you've solved the problem and then other times it's just like you you question your the decisions you've made in life that brought you to this point so I think as you get more experienced as a developer the lows aren't quite so bad I've and the highs are you're more realistic about the highest right so I don't really get to the point anymore I'm like yes I'm awesome like I know everything and I think that's a good thing because I know enough now to know that I'll never know enough right there's always going to be more to learn but I also know enough to know like all right if I totally mess something up or I can't get it to work like that's okay it happens I just need to you know keep working at it or you know ask for help or do something so but I think it's hardest on newer developers you know they don't have as much time to be able to look back on and say yeah I remember that time when I couldn't get this to work and I remember that time when I did this and that was awesome so I don't know anything to help new developers kind of get past that to kind of keep them humble on when they're really up and to keep their spirits up when they're really low I think is a good thing and that's that's probably one of the most important things I think new developers need because there's a wealth of information to help them but like the emotional aspect of it is not it's not as easy to find help with that especially if you're on your own David says I'm learning JavaScript now and still trying to see if I should continue or go to jQuery I think I'm almost at the end of my JavaScript learning David yeah I mean I you don't need to go to jQuery right if you know JavaScript well you can do everything that jQuery can do and just plain vanilla JavaScript there jQuery can just make it will be shorter for you to write even though like technically you're adding in a lot of extra code because you're you have the whole library in but from your perspective which you actually have to write could be less it could be easier to reason about it so it just depends there's a lot of different things you can get into to learn though with with Java scripts besides jQuery it just kind of depends on what you want to do there's so many I mean you can do backend stuff in JavaScript with node you can do VR stuff with node now you can do machine learning which I love the script I'm not saying javascript is the best way to use machine learning the people have strong opinions about that but is possible you can even do Internet of Things stuff with JavaScript so there's a lot of different ways you could go also says totally review with you Jesse about jQuery good to practice and learn and after that try react see David David says are there things in JavaScript that I simply won't need as a web developer oh yeah absolutely absolutely there's there's I've been a web developer for I don't even know like let's just say like five years give or take a little bit and there are still parts of JavaScript that I I've probably never even seen it's certainly never used so yeah you definitely don't need everything as a web developer my method of learning has usually been I learned what I need to for a project and I build on that sometimes if I have time which is rare these days you know I could read a book about JavaScript and learn some things that I never knew and don't really need right now but once you start to get busy with with clients or something like it's just really hard to just study JavaScript so if you're in a position of a student that's great and take advantage of that and learn a lot but if you're actually trying to make money and have a family or have responsibilities to take up a lot of your time learn what you have to learn to get the job done and try to do your best to piece it all together on kids please can anyone tell me which is a good place to learn web development other than free code camp code Academy is good Udacity is good I don't really do much on udemy but people say udemy is good West vos has all these courses that everybody talks about says how great they are I haven't done one of the West vos courses but a lot of people that I I know are good developers say that the courses are good so maybe want to check that out David says that Kevin Powell dev tips and Brad if you see also have great videos on YouTube that's yeah I have never watched anything well I've watched it it's but not the other two but I really do like dev tips some of that stuff is a little bit old but I think it's still really useful a lot of the stuff about CSS and just general design principles are really good and the guy who is Travis a Travis's are really like positive uplifting personality I always like that about the dev tip videos Alexi says has someone done freelancing in up work or some other platform I'm in the urge for money I haven't done something like up work but so I can't speak personally from it but if you're gonna do some sort of online platform I definitely do one that makes you take a test to get into and really like make sure that you get paid what you're worth some of them just let anybody in and then you end up getting outbid and if you get a job you have to get underpaid like severely underpaid so that would be my only advice and going with different work things so I'm not familiar with up work in particular so I can't say anything specifically to that but just in general like freelancing platforms that's that would be my advice Alexei says I would do websites for food Stefan says what do you think about view I have not used you I don't have a personal opinion above you based on experience but there are developers that I think are great and that I respect that love you so I have it generally a good opinion about you but I just don't really know enough about it to give you more than that if anybody else has worked with you before please let us know in the latch at when you think about it Oh Michael Caruso is on the site between the counters you have a days remaining display with 1800 on the actual site yeah this is yeah that's not me I don't make that I don't manage any of the content on this site so I can't do anything about this these are like premade in Photoshop or something let's see so CMD in code so I'm guessing it's command in code says do you think someone should learn vanilla JavaScript before jQuery or another library or do you think it helps to illustrate some fundamentally important concepts I have some mixed feelings about this so all right here's how I feel if you're having like a free online like learning tutorial for people to learn on their own I think jQuery can be very useful early on even before you get to other JavaScript stuff to build up some of that confidence if you're teaching JavaScript in a like a university I would not go with jQuery first unless the course was like I don't know like web development for non computer science majors who just want to get into something maybe I'd do it then but if you're really trying to learn programming in Shawano javascript in a university I would go vanilla JavaScript otherwise if it's just an online course center of course I would go jQuery and like I said earlier I think the key is you want to help people who are new who are most like that on their own and don't know other developers you want to help them start to get that feeling of I'm really building something cool like to feel the magic of web development right I mean like you understand I'm saying with the magic like things working on the page you click the button and things happen like it when you first do that it feels great like you're creating things and and they're they're cool so going in first what jQuery allows you to do that and then if they really want to stick with it they're gonna eventually get into the vanilla JavaScript like it's they're gonna have to write so that's my take on it I'm definitely open to hearing alternative opinions about that too I mean I'm I'm no expert but that's that's generally how I feel about it I started out I don't know probably with a blend of JavaScript and jQuery I tried my best to to learn both but realistically when I had projects that needed to get done I turned to jQuery most of the time because that was the easiest quickest way for me to get things done it wasn't until I really started getting serious with react that I forced myself to learn how to do more with vanilla JavaScript so anyway hopefully that was a decent answer to your question let me know if it if it wasn't if you have any followup questions Patrick O'Donnell says funny thing about spaghetti code I once did an app like that but it ran in production long after I left the company no one can figure out how to replace it that's that's sure that's the other thing I'm always worried like I want to convert everything I'm doing to react and have like very standard things that we do like coding standard like style standards and and all that so that you know if and when I leave someone could come in and very reasonably like take over everything and figure it out but when I have apps like what we just worked on today I'm not confident that that could happen but I hope this is really the last thing that I built that I need to convert over to kind of our newer organized way of doing things and then I will be at that point where everything is at least somewhat standardized with the accept that kind of Kenko institute site I still need to get some jQuery out of that site but other than that like I'm almost to that point and especially with all these videos there's a video a record now of my thinking so someone could come in and if they really wanted to didn't know something they could go right to the video where we did that and find out about it so I don't want to leave people hanging if I do leave here I'm not like I don't have another job offer for anything right now so I'm not saying I'm gonna leave but I just want to make it easier for the next person if it happens let's see hüseyin says hey dude you have got a nose on your face you're right that's that's definitely true I have one it's right in the middle thank you let's see what are your thoughts on react versus you I don't know I answered a question by view earlier so I'm just gonna stick with that I don't know enough about view to really give you a good answer and reactors a few I will say view seems cool but I don't know that much about it and I really do like react I have fun developing in react David said good advice thank you you're welcome I'm glad that that can help you out a little AK acted to mind there's another cool front end channel okay cool so it's a CA de mi ND awesome thank you for for sharing that we're trying to get the Google Translation so our tenhour Tim said akka divine is another cool friend Channel so sorry I couldn't say right off the bat it was in where they call it Cyrillic characters Russian I guess so anyway I did the Google Translate hopefully that's that's correct for your name let me know if it's not I'd like to pronounce it correctly if possible Hussein says yes I did an up work it works only get hourly paid jobs with verified payers okay thank you thank you for adding that personal experience as always I think one of the best things to to be able to draw from when you you know when you're considering doing something like up work or even getting with a new company being able to talk to people who've been there or are there that's gives you a lot of good insight on how says Jessie can you mention the name of the freelancer page you have worked I think it was freelancer I think it's called freelancer comm I did that there was another one called thumbtack and freelancer.com I probably made like $15 from total I mean it was it was crazy you're doing work for like I don't know like dollar less than ten dollars an hour sometimes it's just it's it wasn't a good experience and you have to do so much work cheaply to build up your portfolio and get a lot of good reviews it's not worth it thumbtack was a little bit different I think I got one client from thumbtack and maybe made like I don't know $150 total after doing some stuff it was really like didn't make much from it michael says i spent 15 years building casinos around the country and that was the biggest thing I built that that's the feeling I want these days from coding wow that's really cool she went everywhere and build casinos or stuff that's that's cool so were you like construction worker architect or something like you don't have to answer if you don't want to I'm just kind of curious Joshua says hello there watch some of your vids like it so much I subbed right now awesome thank you for subscribing david says since back in JavaScript as possible with node and the like can we skip PHP in those I it's definitely possible to skip PHP and other backend languages you can pretty much do anything that you need to do with just all JavaScript nowadays so I I know a bit of PHP and a tiny bit of csharp and a tiny bit of some other languages but I rarely use them and yeah so it just kind of depends on what you want to do if there's a specific technology you'd like to work with it uses different language then you learn it but if you're not really sure you know if there's no specific technology like let's say if you really want to work with WordPress yeah learn PHP if you don't have anything like that I'd say just stick with JavaScript you know you can frontend backend for the price of learning one language you can't beat that deal Joshua says by the way is it possible for you to make a C tutorial series or an Android app development tutorial you know what we are gonna do some stuff with react native so it won't be in C or Java or Kotlin or anything like that it'll be in JavaScript but you will be able to build Android and iOS apps with it so we already kind of started a repo for that and I haven't done that many videos with it but I hope to after I'm finished with this current project that we're gonna be working on until probably like the end of February and then hopefully we can switch over and do some more with react native which which is what we'll do the Android iOS stuff with let's see heart says I love react to I am good with frontend stuff now I need to get into backend what frameworks would you suggest for a backend EV like Express everybody uses Express with node so like I'm willing for these streams we use a lot of react with Express and node and we build a ton of stuff with that michael says a slot technician kept the machines running along with keeping the accounting systems warm ok cool very cool I have an uncle he used to be a dealer that casinos I so I've never really worked it one before to be honest with you I actually have never like gambled in a casino so don't have a lot of like personal experience with it but I do know I know a few people that have worked at them there's a casino somewhat close to where I live javascript says are you talking what I think you're talking about with react native yeah well definitely so I actually have several projects I want to do with react native but this JavaScript on a AF for sure needs to be done with react native right like people are going to expect to have mobile apps with this this network I think that's that's a given now if you're going to do something like this Mobile is just expected so and since we're doing it with react it won't be too much of a stretch to make it work on with react native there's definitely some some differences in the way you do CSS and things like that the differences in the way you do routing but the logic behind it and grabbing data and things for sure it is going to be pretty much the same alright Gander 7s2 leave a thanks for watching and I think thanks for chatting with us so hopefully I'll see you back here and some other streams later on alright so I'm at the bottom the live chat now I have a few more messages coming in but we'll probably be finishing this in a few minutes here and I've gotten a lot of messages so hopefully I didn't miss anything very important for work I think I'm good I'm duck checking now I think I'm good umm so let me finish up these last few few messages here harsh says okay have you ever tried using blue bird to cancel promises if yes can you make a series on that I have not used blue bird so sorry I've never used blue bird I think I read a tutorial on it or something at some point like a blog post but that's that's all my experience so I wouldn't be comfortable doing a tutorial on it but if anybody knows of a good tutorial with glue bird you know please put in the live chat so to at least have some resources that I can I can give you there Vivek says networking is a good field yeah for sure I actually took some of like the Cisco Networking certifications because I was going to get into networking and then a lot of stuff happened I ended up not getting into it but I I agree let's see vivix says this AI is good or networking for to get a job in the future yeah I think AI is gonna just be like crazy in terms of jobs in the future it's really cool I talked to a developer on Instagram yesterday about it and she was saying like she wants to get into machine learning ai stuff and I'm like I'm gonna be jealous of you when you do because that's that's really cool stuff let's see harsh says like CCNA yeah exactly I was doing the CCNA certifications just like cisco certified network associate or something like that yeah so I went through like they let me break it down and I don't know how they do it now but you took two tests so like halfway through the course you take one test halfway through you take another test you have to pass both of them I passed the first test and then by the time I get to the second test I didn't really want to go into network anymore so I did take the test but I I didn't pass it like honestly I didn't really study it all for it so I I wish I did it was kind of a waste all that time and money to do it so I wish I would have just spent a you know a few hours at least studying and I could have passed it but oh well I like what I'm doing now so I guess it worked out let's see all right I'm gonna wrap things up now this was a great live chat it's a lot of stuff and we covered a lot of different things and we finished what we wanted to get finished and in this oldschool jQuery app so hopefully I'll never have to work on this again and I have a few more things coming in cool alright so nope no questions okay is there a schedule for for these chats I've been I'm trying to do the live chats at 1200 p.m. Eastern Time every week day Monday through Friday sometimes I have to change up the time depending on what's going on my schedule but if you subscribe to this channel you should get notifications letting you know when the chats gonna happen and if you follow me on Twitter I usually tweet about it beforehand I try to do at least an hour beforehand to give everyone a heads up about you know what I'm gonna tweet or what I'm gonna livestream about so alright I had a really good time I really appreciate all your advice for me and the live chat all your help and questions so I will be back let me think tomorrow all I should be back tomorrow I have one meeting in the morning and I think I'm free for the rest of the day and so until then have a great day
