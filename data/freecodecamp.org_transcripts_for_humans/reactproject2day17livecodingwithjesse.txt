00:05 - hey everybody is Jessie and today we're
00:09 - gonna have a shorter than normal stream
00:13 - so I have a performance review at 2:30
00:17 - Eastern Time
00:18 - so that means like 59 minutes from now
00:25 - so today I'm gonna just do some easy
00:31 - things that we can finish within that
00:34 - time frame so it's mostly going to be
00:36 - like some CSS so I'll show you very
00:43 - quickly what I've done I've only been I
00:46 - today has been very busy in terms of
00:50 - having to do things out of the office so
00:53 - I haven't really had that much time to
00:54 - work on this project but I did get this
01:00 - drop down in here so the Select so this
01:04 - is using the material UI select and you
01:06 - can see it is working so still not
01:13 - perfect so it's going down on two lines
01:16 - so I need to adjust some things you know
01:18 - with the media queries and maybe you get
01:23 - rid of some this pad anything so not not
01:28 - too bad so I guess I guess we can start
01:33 - by cleaning some of this up I think we
01:34 - can definitely get this finished and
01:37 - then maybe move on and just do you know
01:42 - some of the little UI things that we've
01:45 - been talking about and saying like hey
01:46 - like we're definitely gonna want to do
01:48 - this at some point well today's a good
01:50 - day to do that so hate everybody that's
01:55 - joining in the stream on Instagram so I
02:00 - am doing live coding so you can't see my
02:03 - screen on Instagram if you'd like to see
02:05 - the code check out the free code camp
02:07 - YouTube channel and there's a live
02:09 - stream going on there as well and you'll
02:12 - be able to see my screen
02:13 - and all the code so let me bring over
02:19 - let's see
02:21 - bring over my terminal so now I need
02:25 - that at some point and say hey to
02:29 - everybody in the live chat awesome gold
02:36 - s do you have any tips because I'm just
02:38 - starting out if you want to do web dev
02:41 - my good tip is start with free code camp
02:45 - and I get through as much as you can at
02:49 - least in the front-end portion of it and
02:51 - that'll be a really good starting point
02:54 - and don't be afraid to ask questions in
02:57 - in the chat there's a lot of
02:59 - knowledgeable people and will will help
03:01 - you out as much as we can all right so
03:05 - let's let's get started all right it's a
03:09 - really easy thing that we can accomplish
03:11 - and for sure get something done is I'd
03:15 - like this to be centered yeah I
03:20 - definitely think to be centered because
03:22 - especially since we'll be on mobile I
03:25 - think it would look nicer yeah it would
03:31 - look nicer centered it might not look
03:34 - bad if it was a little bit wider as well
03:36 - but I don't really want it to be full
03:40 - with you know on the screen size like
03:42 - this so for now we'll just Center it so
03:45 - I'm gonna inspect this and I'll bring
03:48 - over dev tools so if you're if you're
03:56 - really just kind of starting out and you
03:58 - haven't used dev tools very often you
04:01 - should get get acquainted with dev tools
04:06 - because it's going to be like your best
04:08 - friend in terms of helping you figure
04:12 - out how sites are built and try to
04:16 - change things without having to actually
04:21 - do anything with the code or save it you
04:23 - can just go to change things any any
04:25 - site that
04:26 - that you're on you can use dev tools on
04:28 - and just switch things around and see
04:31 - how you like it so for now what I'm
04:34 - trying to do is find out where our
04:39 - container div is for this and we'll see
04:43 - how we can do this so maybe first thing
04:47 - I'm gonna try is text-align:center okay
04:53 - that somewhat accomplished what I wanted
04:56 - so it has moved these into the center
04:58 - and I did not want that so if I add left
05:06 - there we go so I can add text-align:left
05:10 - let's make sure that that looks all
05:13 - right
05:21 - okay not bad
05:30 - okay and I guess the width of that is
05:33 - it's alright in terms of the words in
05:37 - here it's definitely sufficient to fit
05:39 - even our longest item all right so it
05:46 - looks like that's what we're gonna have
05:47 - to do we're gonna on this div will do
05:52 - text-align:center that'll bring it to
05:54 - the center and then we'll make sure on
05:56 - the container div for our select input
05:59 - we do text-align:left so now it's just a
06:10 - matter of making sure that we can get
06:11 - the style on this container div so
06:14 - you'll see what I mean in a second so we
06:17 - have we're using react and then react we
06:21 - we don't use in normal HTML it looks
06:25 - somewhat like HTML but it's actually JSX
06:28 - which is a JavaScript basically it seems
06:32 - and it works like a JavaScript HTML mix
06:35 - okay so you can do a lot of normal HTML
06:38 - things but then you can also do some
06:40 - JavaScript things like some of the stuff
06:42 - we're doing here so this is actually a
06:44 - react component our select field so you
06:47 - see you don't see a bunch of divs and
06:49 - then an input we just see this component
06:55 - so this reference is some other
06:56 - JavaScript file that actually does have
06:59 - all the markup that we just saw in dev
07:01 - tools so what I'm going to try to do and
07:03 - this should work is we're gonna put a
07:09 - class name actually I can double check
07:18 - let's double check since we have it
07:21 - right here because I think I have it up
07:23 - here yep I already have the Select field
07:25 - documentation so we're using material UI
07:28 - for a lot of our components so in the
07:31 - documentation we should see style
07:37 - readiness a salute element
07:49 - okay we should be able to put the style
07:51 - I didn't see a class so I'm actually
07:55 - assuming both ways I was thinking of
07:57 - doing this will work so initially I was
07:59 - gonna put a class name here so that we
08:01 - can keep all of our styles in this one
08:03 - file this logos dot s CSS file but in
08:10 - this in this case I think I'd like to do
08:15 - it like this style text-align:left
08:27 - okay is that next align left' okay so
08:35 - when we're in react if we want to put a
08:37 - style on an element we can put it in
08:42 - double curly curly brackets it's not if
08:46 - you break down the syntax it makes sense
08:48 - right because we need the curly brackets
08:50 - first to say hey we're gonna do some
08:52 - JavaScript and then once we're inside
08:53 - here we want to make an object right so
08:56 - we use our curly brackets and then this
08:58 - is just a key value pair within that
09:00 - object and that's our CSS of course the
09:09 - camel casing makes sense right because
09:11 - if we would have left the - and it would
09:12 - have been interpreted as a minus sign
09:16 - alright so this is our style here and
09:20 - let's let's go with the style one here
09:24 - as well because it'll save it the extra
09:28 - step of putting the class on and then
09:30 - doing something with it over here so we
09:33 - want to do text aligned just like we did
09:40 - below and this time we're gonna do
09:42 - Center and let's see how that works out
09:47 - so we've saved that we have
09:52 - an automatic refresh so we should see it
09:55 - yep and that's exactly what we expected
09:58 - great okay so you can see with dev tools
10:03 - that allowed us to preview our change
10:05 - first and then when we liked what it
10:08 - looked like then we took it and put it
10:10 - in the code may not seem like a big deal
10:14 - with what we just did but it can save
10:16 - you a lot of time depending on on what
10:19 - you're working on okay
10:23 - and if if you're not sure why I'm not
10:26 - getting real images here it's just I
10:28 - have what I'm working on localhost I
10:31 - can't pull the images so it's I was
10:35 - trying to get it to actually work I
10:38 - think Patrick who's in the live chat
10:42 - often had given some advice as to how to
10:46 - get that to work and I just ran out of
10:48 - time so these would be logos normally
10:55 - they're supposed to be logos alright
10:58 - that looks pretty good now for this the
11:02 - first thing I'm gonna do is get rid of a
11:07 - lot of the space between these and I I
11:11 - don't think that that'll give us
11:13 - completely what we want we may have to
11:15 - adjust it I don't want to take this
11:22 - space too far in right because I want I
11:24 - want them to be distinct and I also
11:27 - don't really want to decrease the font
11:29 - size at all
11:32 - so we'll see we'll see what we can do I
11:34 - actually might be able to just remove
11:36 - this this year of Mercy because that was
11:40 - like two years ago so I doubt we need
11:43 - that logo anymore and since this is our
11:46 - longest one if I reduce the size and
11:48 - remove this I think it should be okay
11:52 - yeah now if we add another category
11:55 - later on I'll have to I'll have to work
11:58 - on that but these categories have been
12:00 - set and have not changed at all for
12:03 - nearly
12:05 - a year and a half so it's it's not
12:10 - something that's likely to change
12:11 - frequently okay so let's let's do that
12:16 - let's take out the year of mercy one and
12:21 - we'll see where that that gives us just
12:24 - in case I wasn't clear about it I don't
12:27 - want these to go on to two lines I want
12:30 - it all to stay one line so that's why I
12:32 - need to reduce the width of that section
12:37 - all right so let's remove that and this
12:39 - will give me a chance to show you how
12:44 - we're populating that in case you you
12:47 - didn't get to see it I think maybe two
12:50 - days ago we set this up so all of the
12:53 - tab names are here and we go when we go
13:02 - to create the tabs we get the tabs here
13:08 - and then we go over all right so we
13:12 - iterate over that and then produce these
13:17 - allies that have that name and then we
13:23 - also use as a key we use the the value
13:27 - right which we're calling tab key here
13:29 - and that produces all those those tabs
13:33 - and we're doing a similar thing to
13:35 - produce the each item in that select so
13:41 - if we want to change it all we have to
13:44 - do is remove it here and it'll remove it
13:46 - in both menus which is kind of nice
13:48 - saves a little bit of time so let's
13:51 - remove that and we should see this going
13:56 - away yep okay so that's gone I don't
13:59 - think that'll solve the problem
14:00 - completely we'll give it a shot no it
14:03 - doesn't all right let's reduce some of
14:07 - the space in here so if you remember
14:13 - when we first did this earlier in the
14:15 - week we had set it up so that we had
14:17 - padding
14:18 - around the the a tags themselves so it
14:22 - gave us a bigger click target and then
14:24 - on the tabs the the allies we added the
14:29 - margins so that there was a gap in
14:32 - between the clickable area so if you see
14:34 - as I scroll through you can see that
14:37 - cursor change so that there's still that
14:40 - little gap and I I wanted to have that
14:43 - gap to help prevent people from
14:45 - accidentally clicking on their own
14:47 - category but if we need to take it down
14:50 - to where there's no gap anymore that's
14:53 - acceptable I'm ok with that hopefully we
14:56 - won't have to take it down that far so I
14:59 - still want to leave a nice size click
15:01 - area so I'm not going to reduce that at
15:04 - all if I can help it but I would like to
15:07 - reduce the margin so here's where we set
15:09 - that margin right now we have 8 pixels
15:11 - on each side so that means there's 16
15:16 - pixels right of area that's just spacing
15:21 - not clickable area so let's drop that
15:23 - down by half so if we go 4 pixels here
15:28 - then that really gives us 8 pixels in
15:30 - between and it still looks it definitely
15:35 - looks distinct alright because remember
15:38 - we also have 8 pixels of padding as well
15:43 - oops
15:48 - no still not enough not quite enough so
15:51 - let's reduce that even more I'm gonna go
15:55 - down to two I'm kind of afraid I might
15:59 - have to go even further oh yes
16:05 - that works all right great so it works
16:09 - he just barely works but we've dropped
16:12 - that down so that we still have space
16:21 - it's still these are still distinct I
16:23 - mean no one's gonna mistake this for a
16:25 - sentence right these are definitely you
16:29 - know spaced out I would say at least
16:32 - three or four times the normal width of
16:35 - a space in a sentence okay all right
16:41 - that works and also the the users are
16:45 - used to a setup that is similar to this
16:47 - with spacing that is similar actually
16:51 - there there may be even less spacing in
16:54 - the current site so from a user's
16:58 - perspective they they're already used to
17:00 - having a setup like this and clicking it
17:03 - so I think we'll be fine like this so
17:07 - now that we've done this and we've
17:09 - reduced that margin we can just copy and
17:12 - paste it for in this case I mean it's
17:15 - not that hard to remember it too but
17:16 - it's nice to be able to copy and paste
17:18 - straight from dev tools into our code so
17:21 - we have our sass file sass is a what's
17:25 - called a CSS preprocessor it lets you do
17:27 - some nice things that you can't really
17:30 - do the CSS like set variables and there
17:34 - are a lot of other things you can do as
17:35 - well
17:36 - and then it you can have your sass file
17:41 - get turned into CSS so that a browser
17:45 - can understand it so we just need to
17:48 - find that tab so here was our tab and
17:53 - there's where we had it our 8 pixels
17:55 - initially and we'll paste in our two
17:58 - pixels save it
18:01 - and I don't think I'm better hard
18:04 - refresh because I want to remove what we
18:05 - did in here there we go and that works
18:11 - right so I sometimes I'll forget and if
18:16 - I don't do a hard refresh like let's say
18:19 - it's just that you can have like hot
18:22 - module reloading and so it doesn't
18:24 - exactly cause a page refresh so
18:27 - occasionally I'll change things in here
18:29 - and do a reload for something else
18:34 - it'll reload the components and it looks
18:36 - like everything is fine and I forget
18:39 - that I haven't moved those styles over
18:41 - yet and then when I do actually have a
18:44 - refresh my styles are all gone so just
18:48 - be careful about that it doesn't happen
18:50 - often but when it does happen it can be
18:54 - really annoying if if you've done a lot
18:57 - and you can't remember what you did all
19:03 - right so this page is looking pretty
19:05 - good about how we want it to still not
19:11 - exactly sure that I like how this looks
19:12 - but I'm gonna leave it alone for now
19:14 - because I'm not sure what I want to do
19:16 - with it so what I want to think about it
19:17 - a little bit more I'm hoping that
19:20 - something will come to me I'll just get
19:22 - an idea one day and oh that's it that
19:24 - would look great if that doesn't happen
19:28 - then we'll have to come back and maybe I
19:33 - can look for some inspiration online ask
19:36 - some other people to take a look at it
19:38 - but for now this page it does what we
19:43 - want users can look for logos they can
19:47 - sort filter by category they can get two
19:51 - different versions of the logo and
19:54 - that's what we want great let's go to
19:58 - the home page and that'll probably be
20:01 - the next thing that we work on I do want
20:04 - to commit our changes before we move on
20:07 - to a different page and after I commit
20:10 - I'm going to take a look at the live
20:12 - chat and see if there's any
20:14 - so I don't want to I want to be very
20:18 - aware of the time so that I make sure I
20:20 - can I can talk to you all on the live
20:22 - chat and answer your questions so I
20:26 - actually have I just glanced at it very
20:28 - quiet in the live chat today which is
20:31 - fine i get i get to do get more work
20:34 - done if the chat is quiet but it's kind
20:37 - of odd because we do have a decent
20:39 - number of people viewing but let's
20:43 - commit so we'll do a git status let me
20:46 - make this bigger I'm sure you all having
20:48 - trouble seeing that okay so I just typed
20:52 - in get status just to double-check what
20:54 - what files have changed and logo CAS and
20:58 - logos dot s CSS that's that's what I
21:01 - expected to see so that's good now we're
21:04 - gonna do get commit and then I'm gonna
21:07 - add the AM flag and this da means we're
21:11 - gonna add first so we're combining two
21:13 - steps a get add with a git commit and
21:16 - then the M means I'm gonna add the
21:18 - commit message right here in in the
21:22 - terminal along with the rest of the
21:24 - command so let's say we Center
21:41 - because it's another selecting defuse
21:49 - category spacing yeah so generally you
21:53 - do want to try to be as clear as you can
21:56 - in your commit messages sometimes
21:59 - depending on the project you're
22:01 - contributing to or where you work at
22:03 - there may be rules about what messages
22:06 - you can use so for instance some in the
22:10 - course I'm taking from Udacity they
22:12 - actually have a guide a style guide for
22:15 - get commits so there's a certain way
22:18 - that I have to write all the commits
22:21 - when I'm gonna when I'm doing a project
22:25 - for that course so it's likely that
22:28 - companies may have something similar as
22:33 - well or particular projects all right so
22:36 - the commit words have some additional
22:39 - things going on for this site we have
22:42 - this here where it says Husky this is
22:48 - what's running everything to change so
22:50 - it's running prettier using standard
22:52 - jazz rules to format all of our code in
22:57 - the same way which is nice so that
23:00 - everyone that commits that all the code
23:02 - gets formatted properly and you don't
23:06 - have to worry about learning how I like
23:08 - things formatted because it'll do it for
23:09 - you
23:10 - these are some tests and we've passed
23:15 - all the tests and now it's been
23:18 - committed so if you don't have all of
23:21 - this stuff set up which you wouldn't if
23:23 - it was you're just starting your own
23:24 - project from scratch you would probably
23:26 - just see this and that would let you
23:30 - know that that it worked now we have one
23:32 - final step since we're hosting this
23:34 - repository on github we want to make
23:35 - sure that we sync everything up with
23:37 - github so in this case we have changes
23:39 - on our local machine that aren't on
23:41 - github yet so we want to push those
23:43 - changes up so we're going to do git push
23:46 - origin
23:48 - master when the master we're pushing
23:52 - everything the master branch there we go
23:56 - so now we know it's up to github if
24:00 - there would happen to be code on github
24:03 - that we don't have yet on our local
24:05 - machine instead we'd want to do get pull
24:07 - and that will pull it down now I don't
24:10 - I'm already up to date okay but it's a
24:13 - good idea to do a get pull every time
24:15 - you start you know when you start the
24:17 - day do a get pull right off the bat and
24:20 - then that way you'll your repository
24:23 - will be up to date you know in case
24:25 - there are some changes that other people
24:28 - have made even if you're not working on
24:30 - a team it's possible and I've done this
24:32 - before that you may have made some
24:34 - changes from a different computer and
24:35 - just forgotten about it
24:38 - so to get pools always a good idea okay
24:42 - so let me check actually it looks like
24:44 - there's not really any questions in the
24:46 - live chat so I think I'm just gonna keep
24:47 - coding I'm gonna say hi to everybody so
24:49 - I see a lot of you said hi
24:53 - so hey everyone I appreciate you
24:56 - watching alright
24:59 - we did have some pool requests that I
25:02 - forgot to mention I actually I like to
25:03 - give credit to those of you who are
25:06 - submitting pool requests to the project
25:07 - and let me think who had a pull request
25:11 - Gavin Gavin submitted a pull request and
25:13 - then we also had some clarifications and
25:18 - discussion on some other pull requests
25:20 - so that I was able to correct some
25:23 - things in the project based on that
25:26 - information so I appreciate that as well
25:32 - Gavin's pool request was related to some
25:35 - errors that that he was getting and it's
25:38 - nice because perhaps some of you were
25:39 - getting him I wasn't getting those
25:41 - errors but just because I'm not getting
25:44 - them on my machine in my setup doesn't
25:45 - mean other people aren't I know there
25:47 - have been some other errors that people
25:48 - are getting so hopefully that not only
25:52 - corrects Gavin's errors but maybe some
25:54 - of you so if you had had some errors in
25:56 - the past maybe you know you might want
25:58 - to try pulling down
26:01 - the latest code from the repo and scene
26:05 - if they're fixed not all right so for
26:08 - this page what I'd like to try to do is
26:13 - bring in let's see I think it'd be nice
26:21 - to have these centered vertically on the
26:24 - page and also I'd like to bring in the
26:28 - the real content and then see how it
26:32 - lines up because I want all of these
26:34 - cards to be the same height so right now
26:39 - they are but it's only because they have
26:42 - the exact same content I also would like
26:45 - to change these to our our cards so we
26:49 - had I think it was Rohit submitted a
26:55 - pool request a while ago and he made a
26:57 - card that basically you could put
27:00 - anything in it any possible combination
27:02 - that's common to material design cards
27:05 - was possible to do within this one
27:09 - component so it's very useful so I think
27:12 - I'd like to change these to those
27:14 - components Center it vertically and add
27:19 - in the correct content
27:27 - okay so let's do that first thing we
27:34 - need to do is bring up the home page
27:37 - yeah so here's our home page
28:03 - mm sorry I just for some reason my music
28:07 - just stopped it was how define I it was
28:10 - really odd so it distracted me for a
28:13 - second okay I got to the end of my
28:17 - playlist that that makes sense
28:22 - it didn't say it seemed like it just
28:24 - stopped right in the middle of a song I
28:25 - guess that's just how that song is I did
28:30 - I saw a question come up in the live
28:32 - chat that I do want to address so
28:34 - breakpoint and I see breakpoint I think
28:39 - you asked this somewhere else as well
28:42 - like maybe in the github repo I think I
28:45 - saw a message just come up earlier today
28:47 - the question is about why electron was
28:51 - added and being used in the project so
28:58 - David had said I think it was for
29:00 - running some of the tests and yeah so
29:03 - basically from what I understand
29:17 - so from what Gavin said I think
29:19 - yesterday and the live chat is that he
29:21 - was heating errors when he was trying to
29:23 - run tests and the errors were saying
29:26 - were related to electron saying that he
29:29 - needed an electron so that's what
29:31 - prompted him to add electron and it
29:36 - fixed those areas for him I wasn't
29:38 - having those errors but I thought I'd
29:40 - pull it in anyway because as I said
29:42 - there were other people that were having
29:44 - errors that were related to testing and
29:47 - things like that so I thought okay well
29:51 - it's possible that this is going to fix
29:54 - some of those problems so if it turns
29:57 - out that it's not needed then I'm
30:00 - definitely okay with removing it I just
30:03 - want to make sure that everyone that's
30:06 - trying to clone this repo and use it is
30:10 - able to do so so it's kind of hard for
30:16 - me to tell whether or not I need it
30:18 - because like I said I wasn't getting any
30:19 - of those errors on my machine so I can't
30:22 - really I can't really remove it and test
30:25 - it out because it's gonna work for me no
30:26 - matter what so I don't know if anyone is
30:31 - able to let's say replicate some of the
30:33 - errors you know if you just remove
30:35 - electron to see what happens on your
30:37 - machine I'm not sure what Gavin was
30:39 - running what his setup was so anyway
30:45 - that's why electrons there right now
30:48 - doesn't I don't know that it needs to be
30:51 - there
30:59 - okay let's let's get back to here let me
31:05 - check the time okay we're still good we
31:07 - got by like 20 minutes before I I want
31:11 - to be done may not need a lot of time
31:14 - for the question-and-answer since
31:16 - there's just not a lot of questions yet
31:18 - but I'll try to keep an eye on it
31:20 - and if I see a lot of questions going in
31:22 - I'll stop stop with the coding so let's
31:27 - pull in so while while we have this
31:31 - logos j/s file open we have a good
31:34 - example of how to use that component
31:37 - that generic card component so let's do
31:41 - that first
31:43 - we'll have them side by side and I'm
31:45 - gonna close close that on the side so
31:48 - that we have a bit more space so our
31:53 - card let's show you I'll show you where
31:56 - this card is where do we use that oh I
32:03 - know here was at the top okay so we have
32:09 - our card here right it's that word now
32:16 - it ends here okay oops okay so this
32:23 - whole section here is our card I'm just
32:26 - going to copy that and paste it here for
32:29 - now just so that we can see it so what
32:35 - we need we don't need everything for for
32:39 - this card so for instance we won't need
32:41 - our image so we can take that out the
32:45 - really cool thing about this generic
32:46 - card is that everything is just
32:48 - controlled by the props that we pass in
32:51 - so if we don't pass them in we just
32:52 - don't get that part so I've removed the
32:54 - image source and now I don't have the
32:56 - image part of the card really it's
32:59 - really cool so we don't have to add a
33:01 - lot it it just simplified the
33:05 - alternative was if there was a bit more
33:08 - to add in and make sure that you
33:12 - included in your project let's say like
33:15 - up here so for instance like we had to
33:18 - import card card title card text now we
33:22 - won't have to do that that's all taken
33:23 - care of in the generic card component so
33:28 - just simplifies things a bit so we won't
33:33 - need these buttons
33:36 - let's see look in fact we won't need the
33:40 - actions prop at all actually let me
33:44 - double check let me double check the
33:46 - current version before I start removing
33:50 - everything
33:59 - that's so this is the current version
34:01 - and okay great yeah we don't have any
34:09 - items there so we can remove those
34:13 - actions oops and get it all so removing
34:19 - the actions so now we can actually
34:22 - remove this class as well so we're doing
34:27 - it in it so what we'll need
34:31 - let's get check out our generic card
34:33 - component text
34:44 - I guess we needed Cyril
34:54 - we're gonna have to do a little bit
34:55 - extra styling so just the default for
34:59 - cards is that things are left aligned
35:03 - obviously you know it's not going to be
35:06 - like that
35:11 - so I suppose title and I don't really
35:16 - want to go with the subtitle for this
35:19 - text so this would be the normal body
35:21 - text so we'll definitely need a title
35:22 - subtitle these this area with the icons
35:27 - is going to be a little bit challenging
35:34 - because we don't have that built into
35:37 - our generic card but I'm not really sure
35:40 - when I keep the phone icons or not let
35:42 - me know what you all think I mean people
35:45 - are used to the icons but really I don't
35:50 - know I don't know that they serve that
35:51 - much of a purpose when I originally put
35:53 - them in I just I thought that it needed
35:56 - something that this was just way too
35:57 - plain and it would be better if there
35:59 - was something and it was also nice to
36:01 - have some continuity here so that like
36:04 - my thought was that at a glance people
36:06 - would know what this is but really like
36:10 - I've stared at this thing for hours when
36:12 - I was building it and I still don't know
36:13 - at a glance what each of these are this
36:16 - is probably you know maybe the only one
36:19 - that's the most straightforward because
36:20 - if you knew that that was the symbol for
36:22 - PowerPoint I suppose you could figure
36:24 - out that's PowerPoint but the rest of it
36:27 - I don't know so maybe I'll leave them
36:32 - out for now until I decide for sure
36:34 - whether or not I want to do do them and
36:37 - then if I do want to I'll figure out how
36:38 - to how to make that work with our
36:42 - generic card component
36:48 - but for now let's try to put in
37:08 - to see where how we have the okay so car
37:13 - title is definitely a prop car title and
37:18 - oops put in for the first one is brand
37:24 - manual so let's just put that in we also
37:30 - need to include this generic card
37:50 - what I'm trying to look for now is did
37:53 - we have a prop for text title so time I
38:02 - think we didn't so I think what we ended
38:05 - up with was just whatever text that
38:09 - would put in here so I'd get rid of this
38:12 - and then add in the text so
38:25 - oops need ads in their generic card okay
38:32 - so I thank whatever is in here ends up
38:36 - being the sexy because we have children
38:38 - under card text so let's see if that
38:41 - works okay great
38:45 - so that did work so I can safely get get
38:50 - rid of I think all these cards and let's
38:53 - stick with this for now and let's bump
38:58 - this up
39:05 - oh well that'll I'm not worried about
39:07 - how that looks it'll get Auto formatted
39:09 - soon so we can get rid of all of these
39:14 - cards and since they're all the same we
39:18 - can highlight them and I can just paste
39:22 - in this and I pasted this twice so let's
39:26 - get rid of that so if you like that
39:31 - little trick its multiple cursors so if
39:34 - we're depending on what editor you use
39:36 - it'll probably have multiple cursors
39:37 - with atom you press command D on a Mac
39:40 - or I think it's control D on Windows and
39:48 - I'm getting a call I think it's a spam
39:51 - call on my cell phone so I've been
39:53 - getting calls from somebody claiming to
39:55 - be the IRS and saying that I messed up
39:58 - on my taxes I haven't answered it I've
40:00 - just gotten their messages I'm really
40:05 - tempted to answer it and just play along
40:07 - for a while just for fun but I just
40:09 - haven't I've been too busy for that okay
40:11 - cool so here's all our cards using the
40:16 - generic card component definitely think
40:19 - that's too much space in between there
40:21 - so we'll work on that but for now let's
40:25 - go ahead and get to learn okay let's put
40:29 - in the correct content for each of these
40:36 - since I have it up here may as well do
40:39 - it
40:47 - whose
40:50 - I was trying to copy and paste but it's
40:52 - actually it's difficult because each one
40:56 - of the cards are clickable so it keeps
41:01 - navigating away so I may have to type
41:03 - this up logos and posters it might not
41:09 - be a great idea cuz this will be pretty
41:10 - boring
41:20 - all right how about let's not add all
41:22 - that in because that's probably boring
41:24 - for your shoot I wanted one that I
41:28 - wanted one that was bigger than the
41:31 - others just to try I guess if I Shrunk
41:38 - it enough I might there we go that's all
41:40 - I really wanted was I just wanted one to
41:42 - be a bit taller okay so I don't think I
41:53 - have time to do both of these but I want
41:56 - to make sure that these cards are always
41:58 - the same height and then I also want to
42:01 - align these vertically so I'm wondering
42:10 - we've already done vertical alignment
42:12 - like last week I think so let's try to
42:15 - make these all the same height I know
42:17 - that there's a way that I've used before
42:21 - with Flex box that makes this easy to do
42:26 - but it depends on the structure of the
42:33 - div so I know with materialise it didn't
42:35 - work because of the div structure it may
42:43 - work here though yeah yes I think it
42:48 - will work okay cool and I think that I
42:54 - on the current site yes I did all right
43:11 - all right so let me pull this over just
43:14 - to show you how I've done this so I've
43:23 - added some flex box display flex flex
43:50 - I thought I did it with these ones let
43:55 - me double check
43:59 - yeah I think I did okay so let me move
44:04 - this off to the side and we'll try to
44:07 - apply some of those same things here and
44:10 - I think the structure is close enough
44:12 - that yeah I think it's close enough that
44:21 - it should work what was that it looks
44:23 - like guys use bootstrap for this I
44:25 - I forgot that I use bootstrap actually
44:34 - for it
44:35 - it appears that I somehow use both the
44:38 - bootstrap and materialized for this
44:41 - project I don't know what I was thinking
44:44 - maybe I don't I don't really know it was
44:49 - too long ago I can't remember zama says
44:58 - that's not bootstrap yeah
45:01 - no some of it the the thing that made me
45:03 - think it was bootstrap is because I have
45:05 - this class Jumbotron and I have this
45:07 - column MD for which I thought was how
45:10 - bootstrap did their column so that's
45:13 - definitely not materialized columns are
45:16 - are like this so the rest of it the
45:21 - styles are more like you know what the
45:24 - user sees are materialized and so I've
45:27 - liked this card huh verbal that's from
45:31 - materialized so I vaguely remember
45:35 - switching like halfway through so I
45:37 - think I started with bootstrap and then
45:39 - I went to materialise but I may have
45:41 - just left in some of the bootstrap
45:43 - classes and maybe copied some of the
45:48 - code so like maybe I just left a bit of
45:53 - bootstrap CSS in there I sincerely hope
45:59 - that I did not actually load all the
46:02 - bootstrap and all the materialized on
46:03 - this project I don't I'm not even gonna
46:06 - check to see if I did you say I'm gonna
46:09 - be I'll be mad at myself if I did that
46:15 - so if I didn't already say this this is
46:18 - this project was quite a while ago that
46:23 - I originally did this so I'm much more
46:26 - knowledgeable now
46:35 - Zama says in your Styles it seems it's
46:38 - coming from Markham Tubman dot CSS yeah
46:41 - that's I ended up putting I think
46:44 - everything in the Markham tabbed up men
46:46 - dot CSS so it's it's entirely possible
46:52 - that there's a mixture of different
46:56 - frameworks and custom stuff all in there
46:58 - like I said I I'm pretty sure I did
47:02 - start with bootstrap but then I didn't
47:04 - finish I went to materialise so I'm not
47:06 - sure if I just left the classes and
47:09 - there's nothing going on with them or
47:11 - what what I did exactly
47:13 - but in any case I think it's close
47:16 - enough that we can try to could try to
47:25 - do the same thing so let's go I think we
47:31 - had to display flex on the row was that
47:35 - yeah display flex on the row and then
47:37 - flex Rab okay so my strategy for this is
47:46 - I'm just gonna copy over everything
47:47 - exactly how it was and then I'm gonna
47:49 - try to get rid of stuff to see if I
47:51 - actually need all of this or not so for
47:57 - this with whoops display flex okay so so
48:07 - far not really anything no we did have
48:10 - some stuff happening right we had so you
48:13 - notice some change not really a change
48:16 - to the better and then here on our card
48:21 - okay let's do
48:26 - and this is not
48:33 - we're not really given a class here
48:35 - let's see if I can try to do it like
48:45 - that yeah whoops I just wanted to see if
48:53 - I could select all of these we'll need
48:56 - to add a class I suppose so we need just
49:02 - flex okay not oh this at this point this
49:10 - is actually what we want right they're
49:12 - all the same height and width at least
49:15 - per row so that's what we want
49:17 - I mean it's messed things up in here but
49:18 - we can that can be the next step so this
49:22 - is good for now let's go likes X
49:29 - direction hmm
49:39 - okay
49:44 - it's
49:49 - actually wow that that works it works
49:53 - and yeah it needs a little bit of
50:00 - adjustment here but alright that that
50:05 - achieves what we want so now I'm gonna
50:07 - very carefully move move this over so I
50:11 - can see it and we're gonna add those
50:13 - styles here so I'll probably do some
50:22 - inline styles and then do I have I'm not
50:27 - sure that I have a a sass file already
50:30 - for home no I don't so we may have to
50:37 - make that but I think I'm gonna run out
50:38 - of time before I make that yeah so let's
50:41 - let's at least get some of it going in
50:43 - line here just to make sure that it
50:46 - works and then for this row we had flex
50:56 - or display flex and I believe we also
51:05 - had flex wrap so since the CSS inside
51:12 - the style is an array or I'm sorry an
51:17 - object with key value pairs we put a
51:21 - comma between each CSS declaration so
51:28 - flex
51:33 - fix rap
51:42 - okay now on this column in accuser
51:50 - I'm gonna remove this row because that
51:52 - was causing some of the spacing issues
51:54 - that we saw when it went down to one
51:56 - column should I remove that row and here
52:02 - now we only have to worry about flex on
52:05 - that rows as well so on this diff see
52:13 - this is where I I definitely want to
52:15 - make time I'm not gonna have time so
52:19 - basically just to let you know what's
52:21 - gonna happen so we've already done it in
52:22 - dev tools we've know that it works what
52:25 - needs to happen next and what will
52:27 - happen is those Styles just need to be
52:28 - applied to each column and then to each
52:31 - card and the way I'm going to do that is
52:33 - I'm going to create another SAS file
52:36 - just like we did with logos so it'll be
52:38 - home dot s CSS and then I'll put those
52:41 - styles that are gonna apply to each one
52:44 - of these columns and each one of these
52:46 - cards in there and then we'll import it
52:49 - at the top like we did in logos so we'll
52:52 - grab stock import our Styles literally
52:55 - home dot dot CSS and then everything we
53:03 - need will get applied so that's pretty
53:11 - straightforward I'll probably finish
53:14 - that up before I leave today and I'll
53:15 - push that to the repo in case you all
53:18 - want to check it out once it's finished
53:22 - okay cool that's not bad actually god I
53:27 - wasn't sure that we'd even get that for
53:29 - but I'd like to take the rest of the
53:34 - time let's in the next four minutes to
53:38 - answer any questions that you might have
53:40 - if you were just here for the code you
53:43 - don't want to stick around for the next
53:44 - five minutes of questions I really
53:45 - appreciate you joining in and I'll be
53:48 - back next week otherwise put your
53:51 - question in now if I don't get you a
53:54 - question because I have to go to my
53:56 - performance review please send it to me
53:59 - on Twitter or any social media or as a
54:02 - comment
54:02 - and I'll try to get to it as soon as I
54:04 - can I do know that I'm a bit backed up
54:06 - on getting to some of the YouTube
54:08 - comments I know that I have not forgot
54:10 - you I will try to catch up when I can
54:13 - just been been a bit busy lately I'm
54:16 - sure you all know that I go sometimes
54:17 - you just have a lot going on okay
54:35 - okay so we have we still had some
54:42 - discussion about electron being in use
54:46 - so if certainly if we had I don't think
54:51 - we have very much yet in in the repo
54:56 - actually this might not be a bad idea to
54:58 - bring up as an issue so that we can have
55:00 - a record of the discussion of it because
55:03 - we have had some stuff in the live chat
55:04 - but that's not really persistent enough
55:07 - so that people can can keep joining in
55:09 - so if I remember later after my meeting
55:13 - maybe I'll make an issue about it just
55:14 - to discuss whether or not we need
55:16 - electron or what all are our
55:18 - alternatives should be if one of you
55:21 - want to make the issue before then feel
55:23 - free we can continue the discussion
55:26 - about it there and then anyone can join
55:28 - in let's see
55:38 - let's see
55:40 - skillful mess says has he ever ran this
55:43 - yet are you talking I I'm assuming
55:47 - you're talking about this project but
55:51 - I'm not sure I mean in terms of have I
55:53 - ever ran it I it's I mean it's running
55:55 - locally I haven't put it on a server yet
55:59 - but I have every reason to believe that
56:02 - it would it would work on a server as
56:05 - well
56:17 - okay Rohan just had a really good point
56:20 - I was I was wondering about this myself
56:24 - in regard to electron being used said
56:26 - probably it's one of the dependent one
56:28 - of the dependencies required but for
56:29 - some reason isn't declared if it's not
56:31 - declared it won't be downloaded as a sub
56:33 - dependency so yeah I am I thought I
56:41 - thought that I'm not sure how likely
56:45 - that is the but I think it's a good
56:47 - point okay
56:54 - Rowen also says the other possibility is
56:56 - that it does use headless chrome to run
56:58 - tests if you don't have chrome or
57:00 - disabled headless it tries electron and
57:02 - then there's the optional undeclared
57:05 - dependency that that makes a lot of
57:08 - sense if I if I had to guess which one
57:11 - is the right answer to our problem here
57:14 - that's what I would guess I'm not sure I
57:17 - don't think I asked Aven what browser
57:19 - he was trying I mean I would assume he
57:25 - would have Chrome but I never asked so
57:32 - okay rhoann says no icons and left the
57:35 - line looks nice
57:36 - okay cool it does look a bit bare in
57:39 - terms of there's just not a lot I mean
57:43 - this is an odd-shaped screen let's make
57:45 - it more reasonable okay this is a more
57:47 - reasonable sized screen for people on
57:50 - campus at least so alright yeah it
57:55 - doesn't look that bad like this yeah
58:01 - well I'm not gonna worry about it until
58:02 - we get the actual content in there no no
58:05 - use you know trying to see your nitpick
58:09 - about the look I guess until we get the
58:11 - real content in okay David said the page
58:17 - looks a bit bare without some kind of
58:19 - icon there's a lot of white space
58:21 - Rowlands is vertically centering would
58:24 - make it look better
58:24 - yeah let's check it out I David I I do
58:28 - agree it does look bare I'm just I'm
58:32 - thinking about we'll see yeah I'm
58:36 - thinking about adding these icons back
58:38 - in but yeah I really do want to see what
58:40 - it looks like with the real content in
58:42 - there and vertically centered and then
58:45 - then I think I can decide about the the
58:49 - logos or the icons I mean
58:59 - breakpoint asks what command with these
59:00 - users doing that cause the airs actually
59:03 - sorry everyone I'm not gonna get to
59:06 - address all the questions I just looked
59:08 - up and it is 2:30 so I need to go see my
59:11 - boss now for a performance review
59:13 - so hopefully I've done a good job this
59:16 - year and it'll be a nice performance
59:18 - review and otherwise it's Friday right
59:22 - it's just the weekend so I won't see you
59:24 - all until Monday so have a great weekend
59:26 - thank you so much for watching and I'll
59:30 - see you later

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie and today we're gonna have a shorter than normal stream so I have a performance review at 230 Eastern Time so that means like 59 minutes from now so today I'm gonna just do some easy things that we can finish within that time frame so it's mostly going to be like some CSS so I'll show you very quickly what I've done I've only been I today has been very busy in terms of having to do things out of the office so I haven't really had that much time to work on this project but I did get this drop down in here so the Select so this is using the material UI select and you can see it is working so still not perfect so it's going down on two lines so I need to adjust some things you know with the media queries and maybe you get rid of some this pad anything so not not too bad so I guess I guess we can start by cleaning some of this up I think we can definitely get this finished and then maybe move on and just do you know some of the little UI things that we've been talking about and saying like hey like we're definitely gonna want to do this at some point well today's a good day to do that so hate everybody that's joining in the stream on Instagram so I am doing live coding so you can't see my screen on Instagram if you'd like to see the code check out the free code camp YouTube channel and there's a live stream going on there as well and you'll be able to see my screen and all the code so let me bring over let's see bring over my terminal so now I need that at some point and say hey to everybody in the live chat awesome gold s do you have any tips because I'm just starting out if you want to do web dev my good tip is start with free code camp and I get through as much as you can at least in the frontend portion of it and that'll be a really good starting point and don't be afraid to ask questions in in the chat there's a lot of knowledgeable people and will will help you out as much as we can all right so let's let's get started all right it's a really easy thing that we can accomplish and for sure get something done is I'd like this to be centered yeah I definitely think to be centered because especially since we'll be on mobile I think it would look nicer yeah it would look nicer centered it might not look bad if it was a little bit wider as well but I don't really want it to be full with you know on the screen size like this so for now we'll just Center it so I'm gonna inspect this and I'll bring over dev tools so if you're if you're really just kind of starting out and you haven't used dev tools very often you should get get acquainted with dev tools because it's going to be like your best friend in terms of helping you figure out how sites are built and try to change things without having to actually do anything with the code or save it you can just go to change things any any site that that you're on you can use dev tools on and just switch things around and see how you like it so for now what I'm trying to do is find out where our container div is for this and we'll see how we can do this so maybe first thing I'm gonna try is textaligncenter okay that somewhat accomplished what I wanted so it has moved these into the center and I did not want that so if I add left there we go so I can add textalignleft let's make sure that that looks all right okay not bad okay and I guess the width of that is it's alright in terms of the words in here it's definitely sufficient to fit even our longest item all right so it looks like that's what we're gonna have to do we're gonna on this div will do textaligncenter that'll bring it to the center and then we'll make sure on the container div for our select input we do textalignleft so now it's just a matter of making sure that we can get the style on this container div so you'll see what I mean in a second so we have we're using react and then react we we don't use in normal HTML it looks somewhat like HTML but it's actually JSX which is a JavaScript basically it seems and it works like a JavaScript HTML mix okay so you can do a lot of normal HTML things but then you can also do some JavaScript things like some of the stuff we're doing here so this is actually a react component our select field so you see you don't see a bunch of divs and then an input we just see this component so this reference is some other JavaScript file that actually does have all the markup that we just saw in dev tools so what I'm going to try to do and this should work is we're gonna put a class name actually I can double check let's double check since we have it right here because I think I have it up here yep I already have the Select field documentation so we're using material UI for a lot of our components so in the documentation we should see style readiness a salute element okay we should be able to put the style I didn't see a class so I'm actually assuming both ways I was thinking of doing this will work so initially I was gonna put a class name here so that we can keep all of our styles in this one file this logos dot s CSS file but in this in this case I think I'd like to do it like this style textalignleft okay is that next align left' okay so when we're in react if we want to put a style on an element we can put it in double curly curly brackets it's not if you break down the syntax it makes sense right because we need the curly brackets first to say hey we're gonna do some JavaScript and then once we're inside here we want to make an object right so we use our curly brackets and then this is just a key value pair within that object and that's our CSS of course the camel casing makes sense right because if we would have left the and it would have been interpreted as a minus sign alright so this is our style here and let's let's go with the style one here as well because it'll save it the extra step of putting the class on and then doing something with it over here so we want to do text aligned just like we did below and this time we're gonna do Center and let's see how that works out so we've saved that we have an automatic refresh so we should see it yep and that's exactly what we expected great okay so you can see with dev tools that allowed us to preview our change first and then when we liked what it looked like then we took it and put it in the code may not seem like a big deal with what we just did but it can save you a lot of time depending on on what you're working on okay and if if you're not sure why I'm not getting real images here it's just I have what I'm working on localhost I can't pull the images so it's I was trying to get it to actually work I think Patrick who's in the live chat often had given some advice as to how to get that to work and I just ran out of time so these would be logos normally they're supposed to be logos alright that looks pretty good now for this the first thing I'm gonna do is get rid of a lot of the space between these and I I don't think that that'll give us completely what we want we may have to adjust it I don't want to take this space too far in right because I want I want them to be distinct and I also don't really want to decrease the font size at all so we'll see we'll see what we can do I actually might be able to just remove this this year of Mercy because that was like two years ago so I doubt we need that logo anymore and since this is our longest one if I reduce the size and remove this I think it should be okay yeah now if we add another category later on I'll have to I'll have to work on that but these categories have been set and have not changed at all for nearly a year and a half so it's it's not something that's likely to change frequently okay so let's let's do that let's take out the year of mercy one and we'll see where that that gives us just in case I wasn't clear about it I don't want these to go on to two lines I want it all to stay one line so that's why I need to reduce the width of that section all right so let's remove that and this will give me a chance to show you how we're populating that in case you you didn't get to see it I think maybe two days ago we set this up so all of the tab names are here and we go when we go to create the tabs we get the tabs here and then we go over all right so we iterate over that and then produce these allies that have that name and then we also use as a key we use the the value right which we're calling tab key here and that produces all those those tabs and we're doing a similar thing to produce the each item in that select so if we want to change it all we have to do is remove it here and it'll remove it in both menus which is kind of nice saves a little bit of time so let's remove that and we should see this going away yep okay so that's gone I don't think that'll solve the problem completely we'll give it a shot no it doesn't all right let's reduce some of the space in here so if you remember when we first did this earlier in the week we had set it up so that we had padding around the the a tags themselves so it gave us a bigger click target and then on the tabs the the allies we added the margins so that there was a gap in between the clickable area so if you see as I scroll through you can see that cursor change so that there's still that little gap and I I wanted to have that gap to help prevent people from accidentally clicking on their own category but if we need to take it down to where there's no gap anymore that's acceptable I'm ok with that hopefully we won't have to take it down that far so I still want to leave a nice size click area so I'm not going to reduce that at all if I can help it but I would like to reduce the margin so here's where we set that margin right now we have 8 pixels on each side so that means there's 16 pixels right of area that's just spacing not clickable area so let's drop that down by half so if we go 4 pixels here then that really gives us 8 pixels in between and it still looks it definitely looks distinct alright because remember we also have 8 pixels of padding as well oops no still not enough not quite enough so let's reduce that even more I'm gonna go down to two I'm kind of afraid I might have to go even further oh yes that works all right great so it works he just barely works but we've dropped that down so that we still have space it's still these are still distinct I mean no one's gonna mistake this for a sentence right these are definitely you know spaced out I would say at least three or four times the normal width of a space in a sentence okay all right that works and also the the users are used to a setup that is similar to this with spacing that is similar actually there there may be even less spacing in the current site so from a user's perspective they they're already used to having a setup like this and clicking it so I think we'll be fine like this so now that we've done this and we've reduced that margin we can just copy and paste it for in this case I mean it's not that hard to remember it too but it's nice to be able to copy and paste straight from dev tools into our code so we have our sass file sass is a what's called a CSS preprocessor it lets you do some nice things that you can't really do the CSS like set variables and there are a lot of other things you can do as well and then it you can have your sass file get turned into CSS so that a browser can understand it so we just need to find that tab so here was our tab and there's where we had it our 8 pixels initially and we'll paste in our two pixels save it and I don't think I'm better hard refresh because I want to remove what we did in here there we go and that works right so I sometimes I'll forget and if I don't do a hard refresh like let's say it's just that you can have like hot module reloading and so it doesn't exactly cause a page refresh so occasionally I'll change things in here and do a reload for something else it'll reload the components and it looks like everything is fine and I forget that I haven't moved those styles over yet and then when I do actually have a refresh my styles are all gone so just be careful about that it doesn't happen often but when it does happen it can be really annoying if if you've done a lot and you can't remember what you did all right so this page is looking pretty good about how we want it to still not exactly sure that I like how this looks but I'm gonna leave it alone for now because I'm not sure what I want to do with it so what I want to think about it a little bit more I'm hoping that something will come to me I'll just get an idea one day and oh that's it that would look great if that doesn't happen then we'll have to come back and maybe I can look for some inspiration online ask some other people to take a look at it but for now this page it does what we want users can look for logos they can sort filter by category they can get two different versions of the logo and that's what we want great let's go to the home page and that'll probably be the next thing that we work on I do want to commit our changes before we move on to a different page and after I commit I'm going to take a look at the live chat and see if there's any so I don't want to I want to be very aware of the time so that I make sure I can I can talk to you all on the live chat and answer your questions so I actually have I just glanced at it very quiet in the live chat today which is fine i get i get to do get more work done if the chat is quiet but it's kind of odd because we do have a decent number of people viewing but let's commit so we'll do a git status let me make this bigger I'm sure you all having trouble seeing that okay so I just typed in get status just to doublecheck what what files have changed and logo CAS and logos dot s CSS that's that's what I expected to see so that's good now we're gonna do get commit and then I'm gonna add the AM flag and this da means we're gonna add first so we're combining two steps a get add with a git commit and then the M means I'm gonna add the commit message right here in in the terminal along with the rest of the command so let's say we Center because it's another selecting defuse category spacing yeah so generally you do want to try to be as clear as you can in your commit messages sometimes depending on the project you're contributing to or where you work at there may be rules about what messages you can use so for instance some in the course I'm taking from Udacity they actually have a guide a style guide for get commits so there's a certain way that I have to write all the commits when I'm gonna when I'm doing a project for that course so it's likely that companies may have something similar as well or particular projects all right so the commit words have some additional things going on for this site we have this here where it says Husky this is what's running everything to change so it's running prettier using standard jazz rules to format all of our code in the same way which is nice so that everyone that commits that all the code gets formatted properly and you don't have to worry about learning how I like things formatted because it'll do it for you these are some tests and we've passed all the tests and now it's been committed so if you don't have all of this stuff set up which you wouldn't if it was you're just starting your own project from scratch you would probably just see this and that would let you know that that it worked now we have one final step since we're hosting this repository on github we want to make sure that we sync everything up with github so in this case we have changes on our local machine that aren't on github yet so we want to push those changes up so we're going to do git push origin master when the master we're pushing everything the master branch there we go so now we know it's up to github if there would happen to be code on github that we don't have yet on our local machine instead we'd want to do get pull and that will pull it down now I don't I'm already up to date okay but it's a good idea to do a get pull every time you start you know when you start the day do a get pull right off the bat and then that way you'll your repository will be up to date you know in case there are some changes that other people have made even if you're not working on a team it's possible and I've done this before that you may have made some changes from a different computer and just forgotten about it so to get pools always a good idea okay so let me check actually it looks like there's not really any questions in the live chat so I think I'm just gonna keep coding I'm gonna say hi to everybody so I see a lot of you said hi so hey everyone I appreciate you watching alright we did have some pool requests that I forgot to mention I actually I like to give credit to those of you who are submitting pool requests to the project and let me think who had a pull request Gavin Gavin submitted a pull request and then we also had some clarifications and discussion on some other pull requests so that I was able to correct some things in the project based on that information so I appreciate that as well Gavin's pool request was related to some errors that that he was getting and it's nice because perhaps some of you were getting him I wasn't getting those errors but just because I'm not getting them on my machine in my setup doesn't mean other people aren't I know there have been some other errors that people are getting so hopefully that not only corrects Gavin's errors but maybe some of you so if you had had some errors in the past maybe you know you might want to try pulling down the latest code from the repo and scene if they're fixed not all right so for this page what I'd like to try to do is bring in let's see I think it'd be nice to have these centered vertically on the page and also I'd like to bring in the the real content and then see how it lines up because I want all of these cards to be the same height so right now they are but it's only because they have the exact same content I also would like to change these to our our cards so we had I think it was Rohit submitted a pool request a while ago and he made a card that basically you could put anything in it any possible combination that's common to material design cards was possible to do within this one component so it's very useful so I think I'd like to change these to those components Center it vertically and add in the correct content okay so let's do that first thing we need to do is bring up the home page yeah so here's our home page mm sorry I just for some reason my music just stopped it was how define I it was really odd so it distracted me for a second okay I got to the end of my playlist that that makes sense it didn't say it seemed like it just stopped right in the middle of a song I guess that's just how that song is I did I saw a question come up in the live chat that I do want to address so breakpoint and I see breakpoint I think you asked this somewhere else as well like maybe in the github repo I think I saw a message just come up earlier today the question is about why electron was added and being used in the project so David had said I think it was for running some of the tests and yeah so basically from what I understand so from what Gavin said I think yesterday and the live chat is that he was heating errors when he was trying to run tests and the errors were saying were related to electron saying that he needed an electron so that's what prompted him to add electron and it fixed those areas for him I wasn't having those errors but I thought I'd pull it in anyway because as I said there were other people that were having errors that were related to testing and things like that so I thought okay well it's possible that this is going to fix some of those problems so if it turns out that it's not needed then I'm definitely okay with removing it I just want to make sure that everyone that's trying to clone this repo and use it is able to do so so it's kind of hard for me to tell whether or not I need it because like I said I wasn't getting any of those errors on my machine so I can't really I can't really remove it and test it out because it's gonna work for me no matter what so I don't know if anyone is able to let's say replicate some of the errors you know if you just remove electron to see what happens on your machine I'm not sure what Gavin was running what his setup was so anyway that's why electrons there right now doesn't I don't know that it needs to be there okay let's let's get back to here let me check the time okay we're still good we got by like 20 minutes before I I want to be done may not need a lot of time for the questionandanswer since there's just not a lot of questions yet but I'll try to keep an eye on it and if I see a lot of questions going in I'll stop stop with the coding so let's pull in so while while we have this logos j/s file open we have a good example of how to use that component that generic card component so let's do that first we'll have them side by side and I'm gonna close close that on the side so that we have a bit more space so our card let's show you I'll show you where this card is where do we use that oh I know here was at the top okay so we have our card here right it's that word now it ends here okay oops okay so this whole section here is our card I'm just going to copy that and paste it here for now just so that we can see it so what we need we don't need everything for for this card so for instance we won't need our image so we can take that out the really cool thing about this generic card is that everything is just controlled by the props that we pass in so if we don't pass them in we just don't get that part so I've removed the image source and now I don't have the image part of the card really it's really cool so we don't have to add a lot it it just simplified the alternative was if there was a bit more to add in and make sure that you included in your project let's say like up here so for instance like we had to import card card title card text now we won't have to do that that's all taken care of in the generic card component so just simplifies things a bit so we won't need these buttons let's see look in fact we won't need the actions prop at all actually let me double check let me double check the current version before I start removing everything that's so this is the current version and okay great yeah we don't have any items there so we can remove those actions oops and get it all so removing the actions so now we can actually remove this class as well so we're doing it in it so what we'll need let's get check out our generic card component text I guess we needed Cyril we're gonna have to do a little bit extra styling so just the default for cards is that things are left aligned obviously you know it's not going to be like that so I suppose title and I don't really want to go with the subtitle for this text so this would be the normal body text so we'll definitely need a title subtitle these this area with the icons is going to be a little bit challenging because we don't have that built into our generic card but I'm not really sure when I keep the phone icons or not let me know what you all think I mean people are used to the icons but really I don't know I don't know that they serve that much of a purpose when I originally put them in I just I thought that it needed something that this was just way too plain and it would be better if there was something and it was also nice to have some continuity here so that like my thought was that at a glance people would know what this is but really like I've stared at this thing for hours when I was building it and I still don't know at a glance what each of these are this is probably you know maybe the only one that's the most straightforward because if you knew that that was the symbol for PowerPoint I suppose you could figure out that's PowerPoint but the rest of it I don't know so maybe I'll leave them out for now until I decide for sure whether or not I want to do do them and then if I do want to I'll figure out how to how to make that work with our generic card component but for now let's try to put in to see where how we have the okay so car title is definitely a prop car title and oops put in for the first one is brand manual so let's just put that in we also need to include this generic card what I'm trying to look for now is did we have a prop for text title so time I think we didn't so I think what we ended up with was just whatever text that would put in here so I'd get rid of this and then add in the text so oops need ads in their generic card okay so I thank whatever is in here ends up being the sexy because we have children under card text so let's see if that works okay great so that did work so I can safely get get rid of I think all these cards and let's stick with this for now and let's bump this up oh well that'll I'm not worried about how that looks it'll get Auto formatted soon so we can get rid of all of these cards and since they're all the same we can highlight them and I can just paste in this and I pasted this twice so let's get rid of that so if you like that little trick its multiple cursors so if we're depending on what editor you use it'll probably have multiple cursors with atom you press command D on a Mac or I think it's control D on Windows and I'm getting a call I think it's a spam call on my cell phone so I've been getting calls from somebody claiming to be the IRS and saying that I messed up on my taxes I haven't answered it I've just gotten their messages I'm really tempted to answer it and just play along for a while just for fun but I just haven't I've been too busy for that okay cool so here's all our cards using the generic card component definitely think that's too much space in between there so we'll work on that but for now let's go ahead and get to learn okay let's put in the correct content for each of these since I have it up here may as well do it whose I was trying to copy and paste but it's actually it's difficult because each one of the cards are clickable so it keeps navigating away so I may have to type this up logos and posters it might not be a great idea cuz this will be pretty boring all right how about let's not add all that in because that's probably boring for your shoot I wanted one that I wanted one that was bigger than the others just to try I guess if I Shrunk it enough I might there we go that's all I really wanted was I just wanted one to be a bit taller okay so I don't think I have time to do both of these but I want to make sure that these cards are always the same height and then I also want to align these vertically so I'm wondering we've already done vertical alignment like last week I think so let's try to make these all the same height I know that there's a way that I've used before with Flex box that makes this easy to do but it depends on the structure of the div so I know with materialise it didn't work because of the div structure it may work here though yeah yes I think it will work okay cool and I think that I on the current site yes I did all right all right so let me pull this over just to show you how I've done this so I've added some flex box display flex flex I thought I did it with these ones let me double check yeah I think I did okay so let me move this off to the side and we'll try to apply some of those same things here and I think the structure is close enough that yeah I think it's close enough that it should work what was that it looks like guys use bootstrap for this I I forgot that I use bootstrap actually for it it appears that I somehow use both the bootstrap and materialized for this project I don't know what I was thinking maybe I don't I don't really know it was too long ago I can't remember zama says that's not bootstrap yeah no some of it the the thing that made me think it was bootstrap is because I have this class Jumbotron and I have this column MD for which I thought was how bootstrap did their column so that's definitely not materialized columns are are like this so the rest of it the styles are more like you know what the user sees are materialized and so I've liked this card huh verbal that's from materialized so I vaguely remember switching like halfway through so I think I started with bootstrap and then I went to materialise but I may have just left in some of the bootstrap classes and maybe copied some of the code so like maybe I just left a bit of bootstrap CSS in there I sincerely hope that I did not actually load all the bootstrap and all the materialized on this project I don't I'm not even gonna check to see if I did you say I'm gonna be I'll be mad at myself if I did that so if I didn't already say this this is this project was quite a while ago that I originally did this so I'm much more knowledgeable now Zama says in your Styles it seems it's coming from Markham Tubman dot CSS yeah that's I ended up putting I think everything in the Markham tabbed up men dot CSS so it's it's entirely possible that there's a mixture of different frameworks and custom stuff all in there like I said I I'm pretty sure I did start with bootstrap but then I didn't finish I went to materialise so I'm not sure if I just left the classes and there's nothing going on with them or what what I did exactly but in any case I think it's close enough that we can try to could try to do the same thing so let's go I think we had to display flex on the row was that yeah display flex on the row and then flex Rab okay so my strategy for this is I'm just gonna copy over everything exactly how it was and then I'm gonna try to get rid of stuff to see if I actually need all of this or not so for this with whoops display flex okay so so far not really anything no we did have some stuff happening right we had so you notice some change not really a change to the better and then here on our card okay let's do and this is not we're not really given a class here let's see if I can try to do it like that yeah whoops I just wanted to see if I could select all of these we'll need to add a class I suppose so we need just flex okay not oh this at this point this is actually what we want right they're all the same height and width at least per row so that's what we want I mean it's messed things up in here but we can that can be the next step so this is good for now let's go likes X direction hmm okay it's actually wow that that works it works and yeah it needs a little bit of adjustment here but alright that that achieves what we want so now I'm gonna very carefully move move this over so I can see it and we're gonna add those styles here so I'll probably do some inline styles and then do I have I'm not sure that I have a a sass file already for home no I don't so we may have to make that but I think I'm gonna run out of time before I make that yeah so let's let's at least get some of it going in line here just to make sure that it works and then for this row we had flex or display flex and I believe we also had flex wrap so since the CSS inside the style is an array or I'm sorry an object with key value pairs we put a comma between each CSS declaration so flex fix rap okay now on this column in accuser I'm gonna remove this row because that was causing some of the spacing issues that we saw when it went down to one column should I remove that row and here now we only have to worry about flex on that rows as well so on this diff see this is where I I definitely want to make time I'm not gonna have time so basically just to let you know what's gonna happen so we've already done it in dev tools we've know that it works what needs to happen next and what will happen is those Styles just need to be applied to each column and then to each card and the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to create another SAS file just like we did with logos so it'll be home dot s CSS and then I'll put those styles that are gonna apply to each one of these columns and each one of these cards in there and then we'll import it at the top like we did in logos so we'll grab stock import our Styles literally home dot dot CSS and then everything we need will get applied so that's pretty straightforward I'll probably finish that up before I leave today and I'll push that to the repo in case you all want to check it out once it's finished okay cool that's not bad actually god I wasn't sure that we'd even get that for but I'd like to take the rest of the time let's in the next four minutes to answer any questions that you might have if you were just here for the code you don't want to stick around for the next five minutes of questions I really appreciate you joining in and I'll be back next week otherwise put your question in now if I don't get you a question because I have to go to my performance review please send it to me on Twitter or any social media or as a comment and I'll try to get to it as soon as I can I do know that I'm a bit backed up on getting to some of the YouTube comments I know that I have not forgot you I will try to catch up when I can just been been a bit busy lately I'm sure you all know that I go sometimes you just have a lot going on okay okay so we have we still had some discussion about electron being in use so if certainly if we had I don't think we have very much yet in in the repo actually this might not be a bad idea to bring up as an issue so that we can have a record of the discussion of it because we have had some stuff in the live chat but that's not really persistent enough so that people can can keep joining in so if I remember later after my meeting maybe I'll make an issue about it just to discuss whether or not we need electron or what all are our alternatives should be if one of you want to make the issue before then feel free we can continue the discussion about it there and then anyone can join in let's see let's see skillful mess says has he ever ran this yet are you talking I I'm assuming you're talking about this project but I'm not sure I mean in terms of have I ever ran it I it's I mean it's running locally I haven't put it on a server yet but I have every reason to believe that it would it would work on a server as well okay Rohan just had a really good point I was I was wondering about this myself in regard to electron being used said probably it's one of the dependent one of the dependencies required but for some reason isn't declared if it's not declared it won't be downloaded as a sub dependency so yeah I am I thought I thought that I'm not sure how likely that is the but I think it's a good point okay Rowen also says the other possibility is that it does use headless chrome to run tests if you don't have chrome or disabled headless it tries electron and then there's the optional undeclared dependency that that makes a lot of sense if I if I had to guess which one is the right answer to our problem here that's what I would guess I'm not sure I don't think I asked Aven what browser he was trying I mean I would assume he would have Chrome but I never asked so okay rhoann says no icons and left the line looks nice okay cool it does look a bit bare in terms of there's just not a lot I mean this is an oddshaped screen let's make it more reasonable okay this is a more reasonable sized screen for people on campus at least so alright yeah it doesn't look that bad like this yeah well I'm not gonna worry about it until we get the actual content in there no no use you know trying to see your nitpick about the look I guess until we get the real content in okay David said the page looks a bit bare without some kind of icon there's a lot of white space Rowlands is vertically centering would make it look better yeah let's check it out I David I I do agree it does look bare I'm just I'm thinking about we'll see yeah I'm thinking about adding these icons back in but yeah I really do want to see what it looks like with the real content in there and vertically centered and then then I think I can decide about the the logos or the icons I mean breakpoint asks what command with these users doing that cause the airs actually sorry everyone I'm not gonna get to address all the questions I just looked up and it is 230 so I need to go see my boss now for a performance review so hopefully I've done a good job this year and it'll be a nice performance review and otherwise it's Friday right it's just the weekend so I won't see you all until Monday so have a great weekend thank you so much for watching and I'll see you later
