00:08 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:11 - Jesse and I'm Jesse and we're gonna do
00:14 - some coding today pretty much right
00:19 - where we left off yesterday I've been
00:21 - trying to figure out how to get rid of
00:24 - these errors that we were having so just
00:26 - to do a recap for for what happened
00:30 - yesterday if you missed it
00:33 - we are trying to use the materialized
00:35 - CSS framework in an old website that has
00:39 - a lot of stuff going on a lot of
00:40 - different files put in by different
00:42 - companies and different developers and
00:44 - there's pretty much no documentation and
00:48 - so we're just learning as we go and when
00:54 - we tried to implement the side nav from
00:59 - materialized we kept getting an error so
01:04 - I tried commenting out different things
01:07 - so it really doesn't matter if I comment
01:11 - out the side nav function the modal
01:13 - throws an error and so pretty much
01:17 - everything that I'm trying to do from
01:19 - materialized doesn't work so I'm just
01:23 - going through and trying to remove
01:25 - everything I can that may be causing
01:28 - conflicts and hopefully hopefully
01:33 - something will work out so that's where
01:38 - I'm at
01:40 - just to show you see a lot of stuff on
01:45 - the screen right now so let me pull over
01:49 - here's what we have right now right so
01:52 - this is not this doesn't look good at
01:56 - all right here's the live site that
02:02 - we're trying to change and
02:09 - and this is we're gonna try to change it
02:12 - to well at least in terms of the header
02:14 - it'll definitely be a different
02:16 - background image this is just a stock
02:19 - photo but we want the header to look
02:22 - like that in the side and I have to look
02:24 - kind of like this we're gonna switch in
02:27 - that new logo that we used for the the
02:30 - last project for project 2 but other
02:32 - than that everything should be the same
02:35 - so we're here right now but once we get
02:42 - with the exception of some weird padding
02:45 - issues that I'll have to deal with once
02:48 - we get the the functions that come built
02:52 - in with materialized to work this should
02:56 - look a lot better so let's let's tell
03:04 - you what let me move this over for now
03:05 - and let's give it a refresh because I
03:09 - just did a few things before I started
03:11 - the stream and I haven't checked it yet
03:13 - all right so hey check this out so not
03:21 - not perfect but look at that
03:29 - we got we got it working so that's good
03:33 - news
03:34 - so at least some of what we're doing is
03:36 - working let's let's check out let's
03:43 - check out the console let's see Wow no
03:46 - errors awesome I mean other than this I
03:50 - I realized that that's just not gonna
03:53 - find that image but that's that's great
03:56 - alright so here's what I commented out I
03:59 - commented out this custom das file
04:03 - because I was I was looking through it
04:05 - and it really didn't have a lot that
04:10 - that I thought we needed so let me I
04:14 - guess it's not going to be in there
04:15 - anyway to get out but the it was
04:20 - basically doing a lot of things for
04:23 - components that I'm that I took out that
04:26 - aren't even on the page anymore so I
04:28 - think it should be fine maybe later on I
04:31 - should go through and look at it a
04:33 - little bit more closely just to make
04:35 - sure nothing was really necessary but
04:38 - there must have been something in there
04:40 - that was messing things up the only
04:44 - other thing I changed is I took out this
04:47 - version of jQuery which I thought I had
04:49 - already done but I guess I either didn't
04:53 - do it or I undid it somehow and didn't
04:55 - realize it so now we are using I think
04:59 - we're still loading two different
05:00 - versions of jQuery so we have this newer
05:04 - version for now I'm okay with that at
05:08 - some point we're gonna have to decide
05:09 - whether we want to run the older version
05:11 - or the newer version and how we're gonna
05:13 - do that we'll see what the best way to
05:19 - do that is let me say I had everyone in
05:21 - the live chat oh we got a question
05:25 - already so Jay rec says hey Jesse what
05:28 - programming language did you learn first
05:32 - back-end
05:35 - [Music]
05:37 - I want to say the first language that I
05:44 - feel like I really learned to the point
05:47 - where I could I could build stuff that
05:49 - works was JavaScript and that obviously
05:53 - is back in with node and front-end if if
05:59 - you want to if you want to take learn
06:02 - and the really loose sense then I'd say
06:06 - C++ I did build a calculator in C++
06:11 - before I learned how to do anything in
06:14 - JavaScript so but I don't other than
06:20 - like just the basic concept programming
06:23 - concepts that I learned when I took a
06:25 - class on C++ I don't remember much about
06:28 - it like syntax and things like that I
06:31 - haven't even looked at any C++ code
06:34 - probably since I took that course but it
06:38 - was cool because I just I remember
06:40 - learning things like different types of
06:42 - loops for loops while loops learning
06:48 - just a lot of the basic stuff so anyway
06:51 - I don't really use other languages that
06:55 - much I mean right now it's like some
06:57 - c-sharp stuff but am PHP I guess I I
07:01 - guess I have done some PHP with
07:06 - WordPress so I completely forgot about
07:09 - that but yeah I can I can do some PHP
07:13 - I've done like file upload like file
07:19 - handlers you know a handle form data and
07:21 - upload files with PHP so I guess I I
07:25 - could include that in as well I once
07:30 - took a little course on Java now that I
07:32 - think about it
07:34 - we built a game in the class but it was
07:36 - more like just a demo like we
07:39 - collaboratively built the game so the
07:43 - teacher did most of the work
07:46 - hey everybody
07:51 - okay so egos asking me about the the
07:54 - hack right so let me explain this so I
07:57 - was just I was just talking about these
08:00 - two different versions of JavaScript so
08:01 - you can't see the other one but it gets
08:03 - input basically through this tag here
08:07 - but it's an old version I think it's
08:09 - like one point ten or something
08:12 - so we I want to use the newer version
08:14 - but the problem is I can't find where
08:17 - this data is getting pulled in to change
08:19 - that so evo had a great idea was well
08:22 - why not just find where it's at you know
08:27 - in the file structure and then just take
08:31 - this file and rename it and I thought
08:35 - that was a really great idea until
08:38 - earlier today I was gonna do it and then
08:40 - I realized that if I did that it would
08:45 - change the version of jQuery on the live
08:47 - site and I don't want to do that because
08:51 - in the off chance that it does cause
08:54 - some weird problem I may not even know
08:58 - it because there's just way too many
08:59 - pages on the site for me to go through
09:01 - and check that and I wouldn't want to go
09:05 - through all those pages on the site it's
09:06 - just too slow it would take me all like
09:08 - days so anyway I'm not gonna do it right
09:11 - now
09:12 - I actually really want to know where
09:15 - this is coming from anyway because it's
09:17 - loading a lot of other files so we may
09:19 - not even need those files so that was a
09:23 - really good idea if this was really an
09:25 - actual test server instead of some weird
09:28 - I don't I don't even know it's it's
09:35 - supposed to be a test but everything I
09:39 - change changes the live site if I'm not
09:41 - careful okay
09:50 - hey Sebastian's back awesome so
09:56 - Sebastian was a regular here on this
10:00 - livestream in the chat but he recently
10:05 - went to Germany and says just got
10:09 - Internet awesome okay let's get started
10:19 - if you haven't if you haven't watched
10:24 - before the format is basically I do
10:26 - twenty five minutes of code five minutes
10:28 - a question to answer another 25-minute
10:30 - session of code and then the end I do
10:32 - Question and Answer
10:33 - occasionally I'll do more code I'll go
10:36 - longer but today I'm just going to do
10:38 - the two sessions of code two sessions of
10:41 - questions and answers so that's what
10:45 - we're gonna do now
10:46 - and I'm gonna set a timer to help me
10:47 - stay on track if I can find it and I
10:51 - think I'm also gonna clean up these
10:52 - windows a bit so once I once you start
10:58 - working on more than one project things
11:00 - start to get a little bit crazy so I
11:03 - still have everything open from project
11:06 - 2 which is not done yet and now this
11:08 - this project I have lots of stuff open
11:10 - for I was working on another project
11:12 - earlier as well and so I have a lot
11:17 - going on I actually spent most of the
11:19 - morning going over a site it's AG it's
11:25 - only like a few pages but it's like a
11:27 - little site that we have this other
11:29 - company building for our single sign-on
11:31 - system and it's just really disappointed
11:35 - I just told them some basic things to do
11:38 - so it matches the style that we use on
11:40 - the other site just I mean really basic
11:43 - like literally I gave them the CSS and
11:47 - said here put this in and then I checked
11:50 - they came back and said hey we've done
11:52 - like everything that you asked for
11:54 - except for this one thing I checked and
11:56 - they like didn't even get 50% of it done
11:58 - so really disappointed and
12:01 - I mean this was like really basic stuff
12:04 - and they they couldn't even get a hover
12:06 - to work like a CSS hover it was yeah it
12:11 - was just odd I don't know how much we're
12:13 - paying them but I don't think I want to
12:15 - know I think it just made me sad so
12:19 - anyway I had to go through and basically
12:21 - in dev tools figure out to write all the
12:24 - code out and tell them exactly what line
12:26 - to replace so that this gets done I have
12:31 - until the end of October it's supposed
12:33 - to launch at the end of October so I
12:36 - just I mean it's not my project I'm not
12:39 - really gonna get credit for it but I
12:41 - still don't want it to look bad because
12:43 - it's you know it's gonna reflect the
12:44 - university so anyway sorry for the
12:49 - complaints I don't it's just I just want
12:54 - to find a really good like outside
12:56 - company that does quality work and and
12:59 - can understand like that things need to
13:04 - be precise so you can't you can't just
13:07 - get it like close enough especially when
13:10 - I'm giving very precise like I'm giving
13:13 - them the CSS I'm not just saying oh you
13:15 - know make it look pretty which is vague
13:17 - I'm actually saying like this is exactly
13:19 - what I want and anyway we've had some
13:24 - bad luck with different companies and
13:27 - websites just really really helped me
13:33 - find somebody good that we could stick
13:35 - with when we need to outsource projects
13:38 - okay sorry I said I was sorry for
13:41 - complaining and then I just went on
13:43 - again from the minute let's I was just
13:50 - cleaning up Windows so let's get the
13:53 - windows that you know the desktops that
13:55 - we're actually gonna use the most we'll
13:57 - get those right next to each other and
13:59 - so here we go get this one just one I
14:03 - think that's I think that's it
14:06 - so we'll have our code oops maybe I
14:10 - didn't do it right
14:11 - oh no it's it's right code here right
14:19 - here okay all right so here's what we
14:24 - have right now not terrible but it looks
14:30 - like we still have a lot of weird stuff
14:32 - going on with CSS so this should be up
14:37 - at the top I mean this should not be all
14:39 - moved over so we're gonna have to just
14:41 - go through and inspect these elements
14:43 - and see what in the CSS is causing it to
14:49 - shift around and then as a last resort
14:52 - we can use important on our CSS
14:55 - properties but a better way would be
14:58 - just to make our selectors more specific
15:02 - than what's currently in place I think
15:06 - that'll be that'll be the best way to do
15:10 - it I don't want to get into actually
15:13 - changing the CSS that's already there
15:15 - because for every file I'll have to make
15:19 - a test file and then I'll have to change
15:22 - the names right of when we're importing
15:25 - that and then I'll have to work on that
15:28 - CSS and hope that it doesn't mess
15:31 - something up elsewhere I won't really be
15:33 - able to test that at all so you can see
15:35 - it would be kind of a mess so and in
15:38 - this instance I'm gonna be very specific
15:41 - with my selectors so that I know it's
15:45 - only going to affect the stuff that
15:47 - we're putting in so we we may have to
15:49 - throw in some IDs and things and use
15:51 - that which I normally wouldn't do but in
15:54 - this case we want to make sure it
15:55 - doesn't cause side effects in other
15:58 - places okay so let's just let's start
16:06 - checking these things out and we'll try
16:10 - to make some space
16:14 - and let's get rid of this we don't need
16:20 - that right now just make as much space
16:24 - as we can here all right this looks good
16:30 - interesting
16:36 - yeah that is that's very interesting
16:39 - okay let's just check out what's going
16:41 - on oh I thought that the the one that I
16:48 - had oh well
16:50 - so now let's let's get this let's move
16:57 - this over now oh I know this is the
17:00 - right one I don't know what that's to
17:02 - you guys just get rid of it oh that's
17:05 - the project - okay whoops I don't need
17:13 - this right now let's move it over
17:23 - man I have so as you a lot of you
17:26 - already know I listen to music in my
17:27 - headphones while I'm doing this and a
17:30 - country song just came on and I like
17:33 - pretty much all music but I'm really not
17:36 - a big fan of country music man how did
17:39 - that how did that come on
17:43 - but anyway pretty distracting just for a
17:47 - minute here but let's check out let's
17:50 - check out what's going on so here's our
17:52 - our nav rapper and
18:06 - let's check out our header first is
18:09 - that's the outside the outermost
18:11 - container so you can see that's down a
18:15 - bit and let's see where so this is our
18:18 - file so anything in new design we want
18:21 - to see that at the top and we don't want
18:22 - to see anything crossed out because
18:25 - that's our CSS also anything that's
18:28 - materialized mndot CSS we want to see
18:30 - that actually applied if we see anything
18:33 - crossed out on those two then we'll know
18:35 - that that's being overridden by
18:37 - something else so so far so good on the
18:40 - header but it looks like we have some
18:44 - weird stuff going on here right this is
18:47 - from styles dot CSS which I did not
18:49 - write so there we go let's check it out
18:56 - let's make it alright so it didn't fix
18:58 - it totally but it got rid of that thing
19:01 - at the top right so you can see we had a
19:04 - position:absolute and we had top twenty
19:06 - right that was because right you can see
19:10 - in the version site we have now that it
19:13 - actually does have this little gap at
19:15 - the top so that's where we got that from
19:23 - so now we don't have that anymore
19:25 - let's see okay with a hundred percent it
19:29 - that that really shouldn't be a problem
19:33 - we could probably just leave that in
19:34 - there we don't need that top anymore
19:37 - so what we need to do though is
19:47 - we need to figure out what type of
19:49 - positioning we wanted to have and I
19:52 - think we're gonna go with a fixed with a
19:56 - fixed header let me double check yeah we
20:01 - wanted what this navbar to be fixed
20:08 - actually that's interesting that
20:24 - that's really odd that the navbar fixed
20:27 - position is not fixed
20:41 - okay so I guess the interior positioning
20:44 - is fixed we just can't tell you can't
20:48 - scroll right now let's see if I can make
20:50 - it scroll okay so that positioning is
20:52 - working so we're good with that all
20:56 - right so we still need to figure out you
20:59 - know this big gap on the side and I
21:02 - think I was thinking about this I think
21:05 - to some point last night and I was
21:09 - thinking you know when you use
21:10 - materialized there's a structure to the
21:12 - page that we just don't have here right
21:16 - we have all this other stuff going on so
21:20 - I think we need to check out what's
21:22 - outside of this header and just see how
21:25 - things are lining up and see how much of
21:28 - this structure we can actually change
21:29 - without messing things up so that's
21:34 - where we'll look we should probably
21:39 - remember what we did with this header so
21:43 - position we don't want absolutely we
21:47 - don't once house let's just say sorry
21:56 - position okay so static so let's go with
22:01 - static and okay top let's double check
22:06 - new design 32
22:09 - oops all right so let's go to our new
22:13 - design whoops this is uh Jas we need our
22:17 - CSS you designed that CSS I'm go to 1:30
22:25 - there we go okay so we need position
22:35 - static and top auto now it should
22:41 - override right because it's just it's
22:45 - the same right it's header here header
22:47 - here and we're loading this after so the
22:51 - cascading nature of
22:53 - skating stylesheets should take effect
22:55 - and what we have will override what's
22:58 - there so let's refresh just to
23:00 - double-check yep and there we go so all
23:04 - right so there's one salt you can see
23:06 - how tedious this process is gonna be we
23:09 - may we may end up only getting a new
23:13 - header we'll see I hope to do like an
23:19 - entirely new homepage but that if it
23:26 - keeps going at this pace then it's gonna
23:29 - be tough
23:29 - hopefully as we go along we'll we'll
23:32 - have less
23:33 - you know maybe we'll figure out a lot of
23:35 - what's what's going on and what's
23:37 - causing this and it won't be as big of a
23:39 - deal okay actually I just thought to
23:45 - check to make sure that this this is
23:47 - working and it is now if you remember we
23:51 - we have not actually added these the way
23:58 - we want to yeah well sorry
24:04 - I really haven't gone all day and now
24:08 - I'm yawning during the stream so I'm
24:11 - gonna drink some some G fuel
24:25 - if you're not familiar with G fuel it's
24:27 - like a five-hour energy except it's
24:30 - powder and you mix it with water just a
24:36 - lot of vitamins and caffeine okay so we
24:42 - still need right these are all
24:43 - hard-coded right now so that's not what
24:45 - we want so we still need to add put that
24:47 - in but before we couldn't even see this
24:50 - to tell if what we were doing was
24:51 - working so we're gonna do that since
24:54 - we're already kind of into the CSS let's
24:57 - do a little bit more of this and get it
24:58 - to the point where it looks about like
25:01 - it should and then we'll just try to put
25:03 - in some of that stuff from the template
25:05 - that'll give us these links I'd like it
25:10 - if we could get the links just like this
25:12 - but as long as we can get close to that
25:14 - I'll be happy with that too I'm kind of
25:18 - hoping that we can reevaluate some of
25:20 - these links when we redo this but we'll
25:23 - see evidently when before I was here
25:26 - when this site underwent a redesign the
25:28 - last time figuring out what links get in
25:31 - the top navigation on the homepage was a
25:34 - huge deal like every department one of
25:37 - their stuff on the front and so don't
25:40 - really want to go into that again if we
25:43 - don't have to but I think it could use a
25:45 - bit of cleaning up all right so let's
25:48 - check out if we're doing yours so we
25:51 - have this inner page outer see that this
25:55 - may be messing us up a bit it's C I may
25:59 - have to just put this on the other
26:00 - screen for a second just so I can see
26:03 - okay all right check this out you see
26:10 - that so we've got we've got some weird
26:20 - margins going on here
26:22 - I'm guessing yep there it is okay so I
26:24 - was guessing there is a max width on
26:26 - this and there it is there's a max width
26:28 - and it's set to zero Auto
26:30 - so anything in there can't go past there
26:32 - so that's why we're cut off at least on
26:36 - this side
26:36 - some reason we're overflowing here on
26:40 - the other side which is good shoot I
26:44 - click the link okay we're back
26:48 - so let's mess around with this a bit max
26:55 - with there we go
26:59 - awesome alright so check that out look
27:03 - it works let's make sure this works cool
27:05 - oh man why is it always so I don't know
27:12 - what's over there that I keep clicking
27:14 - but alright so that works so here's what
27:19 - we're gonna do we what's above this okay
27:31 - so let's check what we're doing to
27:34 - materialize right now because this could
27:37 - take that I think in materialize the way
27:39 - you structure it is there's a main
27:42 - component I can't remember if header is
27:45 - supposed to be inside of main or not and
27:48 - so let me double check that and then
27:49 - that'll determine what I want to do with
27:51 - this div so I think I have it
27:55 - I guess it's this way here we go so
28:02 - let's see what how we structured it here
28:09 - okay so here's our header and there's
28:14 - main below it and then it's just bought
28:16 - ietter mein okay I think we're gonna try
28:18 - to completely get rid of this inner page
28:21 - out of wrap or a page outline thing okay
28:24 - I imagine it might mess some other
28:26 - things up but we'll see so what I want
28:29 - to do is get rid of this completely so
28:33 - that our header well we have two options
28:36 - either we can try to move the header up
28:38 - so it's outside of this and then make
28:40 - this our main so try to basically just
28:45 - add the class main to this and see if we
28:47 - can override the other styles or get rid
28:49 - of it completely and you know put in a
28:52 - main down here so we'll see what's
28:53 - easier once we check this out so let's
28:57 - go back to our be our main main test
29:03 - master so let's try to find that what
29:08 - was that called inner page see if we can
29:11 - find it here in their page there we go
29:14 - okay awesome so it looks like we could
29:24 - yeah we could just move this up I'm
29:30 - guessing that everything that I do needs
29:33 - to be inside this form so I'm gonna put
29:39 - it inside the form for now I'm not sure
29:43 - Umberto's not in the live chat and he's
29:45 - he's good with c-sharp but if anybody
29:49 - knows I think when we're doing stuff
29:51 - with like dotnet everything's got to be
29:55 - inside this form so that's what I'm
29:58 - gonna do it like that for now and I
30:02 - think it should work and I'm gonna the
30:06 - indentation in this file is just
30:08 - ridiculous I don't know how this
30:11 - happened but it was like that before we
30:14 - started also I still haven't all right
30:18 - let's save that but then let's
30:20 - let's get the important stuff out of the
30:22 - way first we have got to change these
30:24 - settings so that it uses spaces instead
30:27 - of tabs so let's see there we go
30:35 - tab size needs to be equal to 2 oops
30:39 - [Music]
30:44 - the editing in Visual Studio code is
30:47 - actually pretty cool all the way copy
30:52 - the settings sure so just kind of as an
31:02 - aside here if you never done editing and
31:04 - visual studio code it's kind of cool I
31:07 - like it
31:08 - so you have your settings JSON and here
31:12 - on on this panel they give you all the
31:15 - settings and you can search them and it
31:17 - gives you a description then you can
31:20 - click over here to edit and it copies it
31:23 - over to kind of like your settings file
31:27 - that just overrides all the other stuff
31:29 - right so this is where you put you know
31:33 - your custom settings and so it's pretty
31:37 - cool like you'd see like I am what did I
31:41 - do I put in here I changed something in
31:48 - my user settings and I can't find it but
31:50 - anyway it's somewhere in my settings I
31:53 - took away the the map like the mini-map
31:56 - thing that was on the sides it was taken
31:59 - away too much space but it's really cool
32:02 - pretty much anything in the UI you can
32:04 - change from there so all right so let's
32:07 - test this out maybe it didn't work it
32:14 - does not look like it worked
32:18 - no all right maybe I need to restart for
32:22 - it to take effect we'll see I'm gonna
32:26 - just double check that it actually yeah
32:29 - it's in there
32:38 - the settings overridden based on the
32:40 - file contents when editor detected
32:43 - annotation okay so since that file
32:47 - already has that kind of indentation
32:49 - that's why it's doing that so I'm gonna
32:52 - leave that alone we're just going to be
32:54 - stuck with that but going forward for
32:56 - new files we have in Visual Studio code
32:59 - will have the same indentation that I'm
33:01 - used to using alright so now that we've
33:05 - we've changed this let's see what things
33:08 - look like
33:16 - all right great let's make sure oh nice
33:20 - and look at that before I don't know if
33:22 - you remember but the overlay was coming
33:25 - over top of this and now it's not so
33:31 - that's that's awesome
33:33 - at least at some point it was coming
33:36 - over top of it great and there it is
33:41 - there's that that link so I'm getting
33:46 - I'm gonna have to fix that something's
33:49 - that's not how it's supposed to work so
33:53 - that's that's a minor thing I'll just
33:55 - fix that later but anyway double check
33:59 - okay great that's working so when you
34:01 - click on one over here it opens a side
34:02 - bar and it automatically opens up that
34:06 - all these sub links wonderful great
34:14 - alright instead of some weird stuff like
34:16 - the color of links is when you hover
34:19 - changes to blue we don't want that but
34:23 - not bad so here's the next step let's
34:29 - try to populate the links in the side
34:31 - nav from the link the data that we're
34:34 - getting from from our content management
34:36 - system and we need the we need to put in
34:42 - the logo too so we'll figure out where
34:45 - to where to bring that logo in at and
34:48 - [Music]
34:52 - actually I think we're using an SVG logo
34:55 - it's a pretty long SVG but we can
34:57 - potentially just copy and paste the SVG
34:59 - stuff right in there we'll see I might
35:03 - do that okay so for now we need to go to
35:09 - our
35:13 - I'm main nav test I just we need to look
35:19 - at what's going on here and figure out
35:25 - where to put these so
35:43 - okay I'm still somewhat familiar with
35:46 - what the mark-up looks like on the the
35:50 - main site so this section I guess I'll
35:58 - show you all what it what it looks like
36:00 - so it was just make a lot of sense if we
36:02 - just take a look for a second so we have
36:04 - these these links here then we have this
36:08 - menu here down here these are the the
36:12 - bottom links that they're talking about
36:13 - so for each one of these we need to get
36:16 - all of these sub links and then the
36:19 - bottom links as well and put them in
36:21 - that side nav under there
36:23 - so this is where keep on the wrong way
36:27 - so this is where we're getting this
36:29 - bottom links so in this green box menu
36:39 - hey at least the ternary operator is the
36:43 - same as it is in JavaScript let's see
36:48 - that's good I understand something so if
36:52 - you're not familiar with the ternary
36:54 - this is basically like an if statement
36:55 - so it's if this is true then do this
36:59 - which in this case is put in this little
37:02 - bit of markup if it's not true then do
37:08 - this
37:15 - okay
37:18 - so you might be able to copy this
37:23 - actually my the timer went up so before
37:26 - I get into this let's do the five minute
37:28 - five minutes a question answer and then
37:31 - we'll get back and we'll start copying
37:33 - some of these and putting them up in our
37:36 - code up here and seeing if we can get
37:39 - this if we can get it working okay
37:45 - let me find my timer there we go
37:49 - do our short break all right I'm gonna
37:54 - scroll up I'm probably not gonna get
37:55 - through everything in this five minutes
37:57 - but if I don't get to your question now
37:59 - I'll get to it at the end of the stream
38:24 - you know like there's a lot of talking
38:26 - going on a lot of chat but not a lot of
38:27 - questions
38:37 - okay here's a question
38:40 - rich rich Bob says is Ubuntu better than
38:45 - Windows and I would say it just kind of
38:50 - depends on what your preferences are I
38:53 - mean you could probably match them up
38:56 - like head-to-head on certain things and
38:58 - say you know one's better than the other
39:00 - at certain things but I I really only
39:04 - use Linux for servers and not as I mean
39:09 - if we're comparing servers I definitely
39:11 - prefer Linux servers like an abuti
39:13 - server over a Windows server but I don't
39:16 - have enough experience with linux
39:18 - desktops to be able to really say one
39:20 - way or another evo says I find it it is
39:26 - harder with Linux because you need to
39:28 - have a pretty deep understanding of all
39:30 - your your tools on Windows it's pretty
39:33 - much all done for you okay
39:43 - yeah that makes sense from what I've
39:45 - heard from people who do use Linux for
39:48 - desktop it's like if if you like
39:51 - handling a lot of that stuff then it's
39:54 - really good but if you just want
39:55 - something you can just turn on and it'll
39:57 - work and and you don't have to worry
39:58 - about it then windows might be the way
40:02 - to go although if you want something
40:04 - that just turns on it just works a Mac
40:06 - is probably the way to go I've never had
40:09 - other than a Chromebook I've never had
40:11 - something that just starts up so fast
40:13 - and is reliable
40:16 - there's definitely drawbacks as well
40:18 - like how much it costs but and the lack
40:21 - of being able to customize things but
40:25 - it's definitely reliable
40:45 - okay
40:52 - all right so you have let me see some
40:54 - questions so sy asks does he look at the
40:57 - chat and I think someone else already
40:59 - answered but I'll just reiterate that
41:01 - that yeah I do look at the chat so at
41:04 - the beginning of the stream I spend most
41:06 - of the time coding I will take a break
41:08 - halfway through and answer questions and
41:11 - then at the end of the stream we'll get
41:13 - to all the questions so and then
41:16 - occasionally I do look over when I'm
41:18 - coding it just so happened that this
41:20 - coding session this first one I I didn't
41:22 - really look over very often
41:28 - Jordan asks what we're building
41:30 - basically we're not really like building
41:32 - anything we're just kind of trying to
41:34 - improve an existing website so it's an
41:37 - older website it's built on some older
41:38 - technology we're trying to go in going
41:41 - in there and we're giving it a facelift
41:43 - and trying to make it a little bit
41:44 - faster so we're gonna add some material
41:47 - design style UI and try to just get rid
41:53 - of as much as much code as we can that's
41:57 - unnecessary there's a lot of files being
42:00 - loaded there's a lot of images being
42:01 - loaded we want to just clean up that UI
42:04 - get rid of a lot of it and just do what
42:08 - we can I mean this site's probably a
42:10 - year or so away from being totally
42:13 - redone anyway so we just need to keep it
42:16 - going
42:17 - and and make it look a little bit better
42:20 - and until till we can get to the point
42:23 - where we're gonna redo it totally Daniel
42:30 - asks is there any way we can help you
42:31 - out
42:36 - [Music]
42:46 - I said Daniel I don't I don't know if
42:48 - you were referring to helping me out or
42:50 - helping someone out in the chat but if
42:53 - anybody right now this project is kind
42:56 - of hard to collaborate on because I
42:59 - don't have a whole lot on github right
43:02 - now like I have this on github and I
43:05 - have a I think I have this linked in the
43:07 - description the fu s starter template
43:10 - that's on github and it has things like
43:13 - in this menu but I'm working on getting
43:16 - some version of of this and github I
43:21 - just what I want to make sure that I
43:23 - leave out any of the config files and
43:27 - because that has like database passwords
43:29 - and usernames and things in there so I
43:30 - want to just be really careful about
43:33 - making sure I don't put anything that I
43:35 - shouldn't I don't get hope so when I get
43:38 - a chance I'm gonna put some of this out
43:40 - here and then at least you'll have a
43:41 - chance to check it out will you be able
43:43 - to run it probably not because you'll
43:45 - need you'll need Ektron which nobody has
43:49 - Ektron it cost a lot of money and
43:54 - there's like no one in my mind there's
43:57 - no reason for anyone to use a cron
43:59 - anymore it's it's not a great system
44:03 - compared to what we have now who knows
44:05 - maybe well at one point in the past it
44:07 - was a really awesome system but now it's
44:09 - it's definitely shows its age so alright
44:15 - so I got through I don't know about 3/4
44:20 - of what's in the live chat so I'm gonna
44:21 - go back and do a little bit more coding
44:24 - another 25-minute session and then I'll
44:26 - go through everything in the live chat
44:27 - so I'm gonna write down where I stopped
44:30 - so I don't doesn't take me forever to
44:32 - find it
44:40 - okay there was some talk about whether I
44:43 - respond to comments and slack or in a
44:45 - live chat I do check in on the slack
44:48 - Channel when I can but that's I usually
44:50 - don't check slack during the stream so
44:53 - that's all you know if you want to send
44:55 - a message or something when I'm not
44:57 - streaming slacks the way to go if I am
44:59 - streaming go ahead and put it in the
45:01 - live chat and I'll check that the same
45:03 - goes for anything else so Twitter or any
45:06 - social media channels I - I know almost
45:08 - never check that while I'm streaming but
45:12 - I I do try to get to it after before and
45:18 - after Xtreme it was just odd
45:20 - somebody from business services
45:22 - department here just called but hung up
45:25 - after one ring so that's that's fine
45:30 - with me I want a code
45:33 - okay let's where's my timer okay let's
45:39 - set that timer again and now let's let's
45:44 - just start copying some things over I
45:47 - think let's see so you know what this
45:51 - repeater and right now
46:08 - I'm trying to find what the outermost
46:16 - element is here okay so
46:35 - all right let's check on yeah let's
46:38 - check some of these so it's inspected I
46:46 - just want to see the structure of it
46:47 - okay so here's that mega menu div inside
46:51 - there that's where we have to you ELLs
46:55 - that are coming and now so let's check
46:57 - that so here's that mega menu div and
47:04 - then okay there's another item template
47:08 - with another repeater okay
47:22 - so really
47:28 - this is going to be kind of like the
47:31 - bottom most level this this item sounds
47:39 - late
47:53 - okay in this repeater we'll need this
47:55 - repeater as well let's check out Mega
48:01 - Man you don't see ya I may not need any
48:03 - of these outer things double check
48:25 - actually I think we should do that okay
48:31 - so will once like this okay
48:39 - I'm gonna I'm gonna move this over to my
48:41 - other screen so I can see it and look at
48:43 - the code at the same time so here's what
48:47 - we'll do so we definitely want we want
48:51 - all of this but we're just gonna have to
48:53 - change like these I have to change these
48:57 - to match what we're doing up here so
49:02 - that's
49:03 - [Music]
49:08 - I could split this let me
49:22 - let me check out I think this is just
49:26 - okay so this is a big list these are all
49:30 - allies okay so we can keep this
49:33 - structure of allies so there's one one
49:40 - ul over everything and then
49:54 - okay so we'll have to keep our URL
49:57 - because they're not there's not a where
49:59 - I'm sorry our ul our unordered list this
50:02 - outermost because that's not being it
50:03 - put in by this template the first thing
50:06 - they put in is this Li and that'll be
50:09 - these allies for us and then right now
50:13 - it's putting in an a tag and a link but
50:16 - we don't want that right so let's let's
50:18 - see what we're doing so what we want we
50:21 - want the a tag but we don't want it to
50:23 - be a link so let me just bring this down
50:26 - here just so that we have a reference so
50:33 - we'll reference that right here so
50:38 - here's what we want let's remove this
50:41 - href
50:49 - and our class we don't need to bring in
50:58 - a class dynamically it's only just gonna
51:02 - have the class collapsible header
51:12 - and then for the data URL we're just
51:18 - gonna call that faith section
51:28 - there we go and then we need the name
51:34 - and we definitely don't want this image
51:38 - i was actually i actually already hid
51:40 - that on the main site because it looks
51:43 - just so old and terrible i guess we
51:46 - don't need the span either rid of that
51:51 - and there we go and that's the name so
51:54 - that's what we need
51:55 - awesome so that one's taken care of so
51:57 - that's that's going to be all of our our
51:59 - top level headers for our side nav right
52:07 - and now we need to get to these that are
52:09 - inside here so for right now in my
52:12 - markup I actually have multiple
52:15 - unordered lists but if we can do it
52:21 - differently I think it would be better
52:25 - it makes more sense to just have one
52:28 - unordered list so let's see how how we
52:31 - can do it so now we have underneath the
52:38 - allies let's check what we have here so
52:42 - underneath the Li a a tag we have this
52:46 - div that's collapsible body so let's
52:50 - let's just copy that and bring it down
52:52 - here and instead of
53:04 - so if it has child taxonomy then we're
53:09 - gonna say I think this is the point
53:16 - where we'll want to put the collapsible
53:21 - [Music]
53:25 - yeah so instead of this mega menu div
53:28 - we're gonna put our collapsible body div
53:35 - right there okay this is collapsible
53:41 - body
53:58 - and I'll need to escape these there we
54:05 - go
54:11 - just okay so I since I was using double
54:14 - quotes and then double quotes inside you
54:17 - have to escape them I'm not really sure
54:18 - how it works
54:19 - and with.net if I could have used like
54:24 - single quotes in here maybe I could've
54:26 - but I decided just to do it like this
54:28 - since it's being done down here and I
54:29 - know it works like that all right so now
54:33 - we'll have for every it looks like for
54:36 - every section that actually has links
54:40 - sub-links it'll add this div that's
54:43 - collapsible body if it doesn't have sub
54:46 - links it won't it won't add anything
54:48 - which for right now everything will have
54:51 - sub link so we'll just keep going
54:56 - alright so we have another item template
54:59 - here that's gonna add okay so here's
55:06 - here's where we can we can change this a
55:09 - bit since we want one ul yeah one ul we
55:21 - can change this up get first submenu
55:25 - item class
55:40 - now this is this is kind of confusing
55:50 - okay so there should be allies within
55:53 - this I'm not sure where they're coming
55:55 - in at probably coming in on that that
56:06 - dot CS file so so let's do this let's
56:13 - move a ul up here yeah we'll get rid of
56:21 - this div we'll get rid of this you l
56:25 - will move it up here and then then it
56:35 - should put in a lies beneath that
56:43 - yeah let's double check our markup here
56:46 - collapse body ul and these are just
56:48 - allies with a tags in the middle okay
56:51 - that should work that that's exactly
56:54 - that's exactly what we want okay so
56:58 - let's do that
57:00 - we need this green box menu
57:14 - I need
57:26 - all right let's try something out I'm
57:28 - wondering if we can get rid of just
57:30 - completely get rid of all of that and
57:33 - just and yeah I think we can so we'll
57:41 - leave this for Peter here but then for
57:46 - this we can just get rid of a whole
57:50 - thing and we can get rid of
57:59 - is that it no that's not it this was a
58:02 - closing tags these closing tags now
58:07 - we'll put here a ul and I don't think
58:13 - yeah we just needed you out so we'll
58:19 - open our ul up here and then we'll close
58:24 - it here so inside that div
58:32 - okay now this should just output allies
58:39 - in this same way we want it to here so
58:43 - let's say that and what we can do is we
58:56 - can just check out what gets outputted
58:58 - here without having to change any of
59:00 - this yet okay so let me refresh
59:06 - hopefully no errors will see nice okay
59:16 - so this is looking looking pretty good
59:21 - so far so let me bring this over so
59:25 - y'all can see the structure so this is
59:27 - what we wanted we wanted these sections
59:31 - right we have the the UL
59:47 - okay
59:49 - awesome
59:51 - so here we go that we have all these
59:53 - here the only thing I'm not sure about
59:57 - is is that that first section did we
60:03 - have that all we did have that but it
60:09 - was last oh you know what
60:15 - that's uh that's this one that we left
60:20 - in here let me take that out
60:22 - I was confusing me okay let's give it a
60:28 - refresh and should be should be alright
60:35 - now
60:50 - I just got a slack message from the
60:55 - project manager so let's see you have to
60:59 - replace the character with so I have
61:02 - this file uploader right and if someone
61:06 - uploads a file with a dot in it with a
61:10 - period in it other than the file
61:12 - extension then she gets an error when
61:17 - she tries to get the file I can't
61:22 - remember what I replaced it with let's
61:26 - see so you get an error let me see I
61:34 - think if you used to take out I thought
61:38 - if you just took out the dot that it
61:40 - would work maybe I changed the dot too -
61:42 - no I didn't
61:51 - oh I don't know I will
62:05 - all right I'll get to that I mean
62:25 - all right so I was okay cool I just want
62:29 - to check to make sure it wasn't an
62:31 - emergency otherwise we were gonna be
62:34 - switching gears a little bit and doing
62:36 - something else on this stream okay but
62:38 - not an emergency so let's
62:52 - sorry it's just just let her know I will
62:58 - be able to get the file alright so this
63:02 - is working so now what we want to do is
63:04 - actually put this inside actually put
63:11 - this inside here so if you remember we
63:13 - need to keep this outer UL but then
63:17 - everything else can go so let's do that
63:22 - is this the outer one yep okay so here's
63:27 - our outer UL and let me double check
63:55 - actually I think I think we're taking
63:58 - out too many us not we are let me
64:18 - yeah okay so it's not we want to keep
64:23 - this ul this Li I'm gonna keep it this
64:32 - you oh okay so this is that one
64:39 - so just a bit from this Li up we'll take
64:44 - that out
64:51 - okay
64:57 - this is always tough to do especially
65:01 - when it when I'm on the like the the
65:04 - trackpad for a Mac select bodies here
65:07 - the mouse okay
65:10 - is this it yep that's it
65:14 - okay take all that out and replace it
65:20 - with this and everything should work
65:29 - save it
65:32 - refresh
65:46 - whoa check that out all right awesome
65:57 - let's make sure all right there's links
66:03 - look good nah haze all right cool so
66:10 - we've successfully figured out how
66:14 - everything is coming into these
66:16 - templates and we've been able to adapt
66:19 - it to fit the materialise you know side
66:24 - nav component and I know I said this for
66:31 - the last couple of streams but this is
66:33 - really it feels a comet-like reacts
66:36 - right we basically just popped in you
66:41 - know our data there's some weird stuff
66:45 - going on that's definitely not react
66:46 - like but we know enough now that I think
66:56 - we can do this we can build out you know
67:02 - this homepage so not bad see how much
67:08 - time I have and go from there all right
67:12 - about three minutes maybe I'm saying
67:18 - three minutes I'm not sure how much I
67:19 - get done we do need a logo actually let
67:23 - me okay
67:24 - want to double check and make sure that
67:26 - that still works yep that works too
67:28 - awesome if you do need a logo to go
67:32 - there hmm
67:38 - it's probably gonna take me three
67:40 - minutes to find that logo
67:44 - so that's probably not gonna work out so
67:47 - I think what I'll do is I'm just going
67:51 - to start the question answer session a
67:53 - few minutes early and yeah that's good I
67:59 - this was not bad you know on a Friday I
68:01 - got everything done I got it done sooner
68:03 - than I thought I would it works so this
68:07 - may be my most successful stream ever
68:11 - but right now I'm gonna scroll up I'm
68:15 - gonna so if you have a question please
68:17 - put in the live chat right now if you
68:18 - don't have a question you'd be great if
68:19 - you could stick around and help answer
68:20 - some questions I would certainly value
68:24 - having your expertise here if you can't
68:27 - stick around for the question answer
68:28 - session I totally understand thank you
68:30 - so much for watching and I'll be back on
68:33 - Monday probably around sometime around
68:36 - 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time
68:38 - you can subscribe to the free camps
68:40 - Channel and you'll get an alert whenever
68:42 - I schedule the next stream or you could
68:45 - you could also follow me on Twitter and
68:48 - I always tweet right after I schedule
68:50 - stream I put out a tweet and I let you
68:53 - all know what I'm gonna be doing that
68:56 - day and when I'm gonna do it and I
68:59 - provide a link to the live stream okay
69:09 - okay
69:23 - okay let's see web some okay so we have
69:27 - a question rich rich OGG says is
69:30 - webstorm good I've never used webstorm
69:34 - so that'll have to be I don't have to be
69:36 - answered by those in the live chat
69:39 - because I I just don't know very much at
69:43 - all about it
69:53 - Jordan asked why why dotnet it was not
69:59 - my choice that just happens to be what
70:02 - this site was built in so I'm not
70:08 - allowed to completely rebuild the site
70:10 - from the ground up yet so from now my
70:14 - job is just to make do with what we have
70:16 - and make it make it faster and prettier
70:21 - and hopefully more user friendly as best
70:25 - I can with with what we have so so
70:29 - that's why I'm working with dotnet right
70:31 - now hopefully the next time I work on
70:35 - this site will be back with react and
70:40 - that we'll be doing will be doing
70:43 - everything at that point we'll probably
70:46 - like back in front end everything to
70:50 - build this if a question from MH r says
71:00 - best text editors best text editors for
71:08 - JavaScript PHP etc I like I like atom
71:16 - that's like my main editor but I'm using
71:19 - Visual Studio code right now I also like
71:21 - that I'm still not really that used to
71:26 - Visual Studio code so sorry uh-huh kept
71:36 - feeling that sneeze coming on us hoping
71:41 - we just go away okay so I'm not that
71:44 - used to Visual Studio code yet I like it
71:46 - and I can see a lot of potential in it
71:48 - I'm not sure it hasn't been out as long
71:51 - as Adams so I'm not sure like in terms
71:53 - of the the package ecosystem of you know
71:57 - it doesn't have as much available for
72:01 - customization in terms of like packages
72:03 - already made I don't really know
72:08 - i-i-i go with those two I've heard
72:11 - though that sublime is good a lot a lot
72:14 - of people it seems like a lot of people
72:17 - that do videos on YouTube use sublime
72:21 - those are really the only ones that I'm
72:23 - familiar with
72:25 - I used to use notepad plus plus back in
72:28 - the day I don't really recommend it but
72:32 - it was better than regular notepad
72:34 - starting out
72:51 - okay so Shay says hey Jessi what made
72:55 - you settle on react and material design
72:57 - for the new university sites and
73:00 - thoughts of WordPress moving away from
73:02 - reactants just announced okay so for the
73:05 - first question for the material design
73:11 - aspect of it I needed so we don't have
73:15 - any web designers here at the University
73:19 - so basically when I was hired we didn't
73:22 - really have like a standard a fully
73:25 - developed standard so we had all you
73:27 - know different sites with you know
73:30 - really different I don't know they they
73:37 - just looked they had some elements that
73:39 - were similar but I mean they they just
73:41 - looked really weird and they had like
73:47 - not even that the hex colors weren't
73:49 - even the same sometimes so it was just
73:51 - kind of a little bit of a mess so I knew
73:54 - we needed like we needed something that
73:56 - could be cohesive right but I I had to
74:00 - develop these sites mainly that like my
74:03 - main job was I had to actually build it
74:05 - you know I had to develop that mostly
74:06 - front-end but even sometimes back-end
74:08 - stuff so I knew like I needed to just
74:12 - settle on a premade system that I knew
74:15 - worked and I could go with so I liked
74:20 - material design I thought it was nice it
74:23 - was simple the docks are very clear and
74:26 - easy to understand there are also like
74:31 - frameworks like materialized that were
74:33 - really easy to use and you know
74:37 - developed I mean when I first started
74:38 - using and it was in the early stages so
74:40 - there were some buggy stuff but I mean
74:42 - now it's pretty reliable so I just I
74:48 - chose you know it shows the material
74:50 - design because you know it seemed to me
74:54 - like a very simple well known design
74:57 - that users would be familiar with
74:59 - already so they wouldn't have to guess
75:01 - what they're supposed to do or what
75:03 - different things
75:04 - and the site you know they I like the
75:07 - idea that it's so widely used that you
75:11 - make sure user immediately familiar with
75:14 - your UI I didn't want people to have to
75:16 - guess what they're supposed to do so
75:18 - anyway that's what I went with I'm sure
75:20 - there there are other things I could
75:21 - have gone with but I'm not I'm happy
75:24 - with with going with material design in
75:29 - terms of react react was the decision to
75:34 - go with react came later I mean I knew
75:40 - like everybody kept hearing about react
75:42 - so I knew like when if when I first
75:44 - started hearing about it it was this
75:46 - cool thing but I wasn't sure I mean you
75:49 - know you know how it is like there's
75:51 - always new new things coming and going
75:53 - with JavaScript but it just kept staying
75:57 - around and getting bigger and bigger and
75:59 - then I'd hear more about it and then
76:00 - it'd be like every talk at a conference
76:02 - was talking about react and you know all
76:05 - these videos on YouTube we're talking
76:08 - about react and so then I just I started
76:11 - I started using I started messing around
76:14 - with it and I build I build some stuff
76:20 - with it I built like a site or for a
76:23 - client with it got familiar with it I
76:25 - really started to like it and I I like
76:30 - that there's so many people using it
76:33 - because there's there's always a lot of
76:36 - information if I have a problem with
76:37 - something in react I can usually find
76:39 - the answer very quickly
76:42 - I'm not saying reacts the only system
76:43 - like that but it's it's nice so I mean
76:46 - there are some other systems that I
76:48 - could use besides react but they just
76:49 - don't have that user base so that's kind
76:55 - of why with react I mean it's not it's
77:01 - not really like I sat down and really
77:03 - evaluated all the different systems it
77:05 - was just kind of going with you know
77:07 - I've used this a little bit I've used
77:08 - that a little bit what's really gonna
77:10 - work for us right now and what's likely
77:12 - to be to stick around for a while in the
77:15 - future right I don't want to like with
77:16 - the site we have right now
77:17 - we're in a position where the CMS that
77:20 - we use Ektron their company got bought
77:22 - out by another company I'm not even sure
77:25 - you know what the supports like if
77:27 - there's still updates like it's
77:29 - basically a dead content management
77:31 - system right there's not really anybody
77:34 - that works on it there are very few
77:36 - companies and developers that work with
77:38 - that system so you're kind of stuck and
77:40 - end up having to pay a lot of money for
77:42 - work that in my opinion from looking at
77:45 - the work isn't really that great so I
77:49 - don't want to be in that situation again
77:50 - so right now trying to find a react
77:52 - developer is a lot easier than trying to
77:56 - find let's say like an extra one right
77:58 - so I don't know I think it sets us up in
78:01 - a good position to be able to bring
78:03 - people on either as employees or as like
78:07 - contract workers that will be familiar
78:09 - with our system
78:10 - they'll be familiar with material design
78:11 - they'll be familiar with react so now
78:15 - that was what kind of my thoughts just
78:16 - kind of thinking ahead as to you know
78:18 - what's and that's the same way we went
78:20 - with like WordPress for a lot of
78:22 - handling a lot of our data as a content
78:24 - management system we could have gone
78:25 - with some other stuff we use Drupal for
78:28 - some other sites that have been built
78:30 - you know by outside contractors but I
78:33 - like to stay with WordPress because it
78:34 - has the largest market share right now
78:36 - among CMS's at least at least last time
78:41 - I checked I think it had the largest
78:42 - market share so once again if I needed
78:45 - to hire somebody to work on that my odds
78:48 - of finding a wordpress developer are
78:50 - greater than finding a developer of
78:52 - probably any other type of CMS right now
78:55 - so the next part this ended up being a
78:59 - long answer to the question so I mean
79:01 - they were there really like three
79:02 - questions here so the third question
79:05 - thoughts of moving WordPress away of
79:08 - WordPress moving away from react that's
79:10 - the first I heard of it I haven't seen
79:12 - anything about it so I have I guess I
79:14 - don't have any thoughts because I don't
79:15 - have any details right now my first
79:19 - reaction was is this about the react
79:23 - license I don't know I mean I but I have
79:29 - no idea I'll have to
79:30 - I'll have to find out more about it but
79:35 - I'm really interested to see what their
79:37 - reasoning is though if it's just about
79:40 - the licensing I'm not that worried about
79:41 - it because I mean I'm a little guy I'm
79:45 - not I'm not gonna be on anybody's radar
79:48 - with anything I'm doing I'm just I'm not
79:50 - worried about that but I could see why
79:53 - WordPress might be worried about that
80:14 - jonbi says my favorite text editor is a
80:17 - stone tablet and a chisel that's
80:19 - old-school I had a meeting one time when
80:23 - I was doing some like subcontracting
80:26 - work for a media marketing company and
80:29 - we had a Skype meeting with everybody
80:31 - that worked for this place were all like
80:33 - remote workers so we had a Skype meeting
80:35 - try to get everybody together to talk to
80:38 - each other because we had never met met
80:40 - before there were people working that
80:41 - with this company that I had never met
80:43 - in my life and they they heard me they
80:51 - liked they heard the sound of my pen
80:52 - writing on a paper and they were all
80:55 - like what are you doing you seriously
80:57 - use paper they were all shocked that I
80:59 - still used paper especially in a Skype
81:03 - meeting so sometimes it's nice I've
81:07 - never gone so old old school to use you
81:10 - know a chisel but I I can understand
81:15 - wanting to you know physically you know
81:18 - leave some marks on something
81:36 - let's see Rishabh says what is html5
81:41 - boilerplate
81:52 - actually I'm thinking so John Hutten in
81:55 - John Hanson says a boiler plate is a
81:59 - node NPM install environment many out
82:02 - there maybe you mean a keystroke
82:04 - shortcut for HTML and your editor yeah
82:08 - I'm not sure I guess maybe I don't know
82:13 - for sure but I thought html5 boilerplate
82:16 - was just like a starter like some markup
82:23 - just to get you started that just has
82:25 - some of the basic stuff you need I like
82:29 - something similar to what like now I
82:35 - don't really know I might have to look
82:36 - this up now because I maybe I'm
82:38 - second-guessing what I thought html5
82:41 - boilerplate was I'll look it up after
82:46 - this jadyn all right now
82:52 - Jambi says what resource have you been
82:56 - using to learn c-sharp slash asp.net
83:03 - umberto I've been using umberto in the
83:06 - live stream that's that's my resource so
83:08 - he's not here right now but he's gonna
83:10 - he's actually on a flight right now to
83:13 - Denver so he sent me a message earlier
83:16 - to let me know he wouldn't be in the
83:18 - chat so he'll probably hear this later
83:20 - but that's pretty much it I I've I've
83:23 - been relying on Umberto's expertise and
83:26 - your help in the live chat mainly
83:29 - because I I don't see the benefit of me
83:36 - learning that much of it right now
83:39 - because for two reasons one this is
83:44 - right now is the only site that I'll
83:46 - ever need to work on in the foreseeable
83:48 - future that uses dotnet c-sharp the
83:54 - second reason is we're getting we hired
83:57 - a new web developer he won't be in my
84:01 - department he's gonna work in another
84:02 - department here but his job is gonna be
84:06 - to handle all like the dotnet c-sharp
84:09 - stuff so he starts October 2nd that's
84:14 - just in a couple of weeks so if any if I
84:17 - need any help with that
84:19 - I'm supposed to go go to him and I'm
84:22 - gonna handle you know a lot of the all
84:25 - the react stuff that we've been doing
84:26 - like that's gonna be my domain and I'm
84:29 - gonna be in charge of making sure that
84:31 - the branding standards on the web like
84:33 - the style guide is all enforced so this
84:36 - other guy's gonna handle the C sharp and
84:40 - dotnet stuff and then he's gonna come to
84:43 - me when he needs more like front-end
84:48 - design related stuff so that's how it's
84:54 - gonna work out so I just don't see the
84:56 - benefit right now and me spending a lot
84:58 - of time learning something that I'm not
84:59 - likely to use so I just kind of want to
85:02 - learn enough to get by
85:04 - and get this to a point where it's
85:06 - better I mean honestly it's not really
85:10 - gonna be that hard to make it better
85:11 - than it is right now cuz it's really
85:13 - slow right now but I want to try to make
85:17 - it as good as I can without wasting my
85:20 - time learning something so right now all
85:23 - of my learning time is going into
85:26 - learning react so I'm learning Redux
85:28 - right now and I just started learning
85:30 - react native like maybe two days ago I
85:33 - started on the react native part of the
85:36 - course I'm taking so and that's what
85:39 - I'll be doing after work today and all
85:41 - day Saturday and so hopefully I'll have
85:44 - hopefully I'll have a Redux project
85:46 - finished and then maybe on Monday I can
85:49 - show you all it's already in on my
85:53 - github so like my personal github
85:59 - account has its like Udacity readable or
86:03 - something if you want to check it out
86:06 - the design on it is really crazy in old
86:09 - school so I think I will show you all
86:11 - when I'm ready to finished just just for
86:14 - fun definitely not material design
86:24 - okay Shree Kampf asks is this the new
86:29 - project yes it is the new project James
86:38 - Moore says is learning asp.net MVC
86:41 - advantageous as a front-end developer it
86:49 - depends on what you want to do I guess I
86:52 - usually say when I'm asked about what
86:58 - what to learn really is it just depends
87:02 - so if you like working with this stuff
87:04 - or if you know of a company you really
87:06 - want to work for that uses it then yeah
87:09 - it would be advantageous if if you're
87:13 - talking though more in general what's
87:15 - that meant Aegis for a front-end
87:16 - developer
87:17 - I'd say focus on JavaScript because as a
87:21 - front-end developer you're pretty much
87:23 - always going to be using javascript no
87:26 - matter what else you're using you know
87:29 - Java scripts everywhere so I mean
87:31 - obviously HTML and CSS right you have to
87:33 - know that but those are a little bit
87:37 - easier to learn enough to be decent with
87:41 - but I would say if you're not sure
87:45 - exactly what you want to do but you know
87:47 - you want to do front-end stick with
87:49 - JavaScript and then once you start to
87:51 - get an idea of what you like then you
87:54 - can choose something else to pick up as
87:57 - well but I wouldn't if someone just came
88:03 - up and said hey I want to be a friend of
88:04 - developer what would I learn I probably
88:06 - never say dotnet that would not be first
88:09 - on my list
88:20 - okay there there's been like a running
88:23 - discussion about text editors throughout
88:26 - the live chat and now Lara says surely
88:29 - vim or Emacs is the best it's always I
88:35 - feel like we've had this discussion so
88:38 - many times on the live chat about about
88:42 - editors I really just need to do a video
88:45 - about editors and then just refer people
88:47 - to that but honestly I know I've already
88:53 - said what editors I use and what I like
88:55 - I've seen people use them and it looks
88:58 - really cool so I like them I have no
89:03 - idea how to use them I've never used X I
89:05 - tried to use it once and I know
89:09 - everybody says this and it's a joke but
89:11 - I honestly did have trouble
89:14 - exiting them right it looks like so I've
89:19 - just never really had the time to be
89:21 - able to try to learn it one day maybe
89:25 - one day I want to be you know the person
89:27 - that does a live demo at a conference
89:29 - using them and looks awesome like but so
89:35 - I don't disagree that BAM and I think
89:37 - Emacs is a similar situation and you see
89:39 - somebody using Emacs you're like wow
89:43 - Emacs and then so let's see
89:56 - okay so John B says the WordPress issue
89:58 - is about the react license yes they
90:01 - decided to go away from react so as not
90:04 - to propagate the issues of the patent
90:07 - issue to anyone who uses Gutenberg the
90:10 - WordPress tool okay that makes sense
90:13 - yeah that makes a lot of sense that's
90:15 - what I figured so basically now that I
90:20 - know for sure that it was the patent
90:22 - issue my thoughts on the whole WordPress
90:26 - moving away from react thing is one I'm
90:28 - like kind of disappointed because I was
90:29 - excited about WordPress using react so
90:32 - much but in terms of the impact this is
90:37 - gonna have on react in general and on my
90:39 - use of it is it's not gonna impact my
90:42 - use of it at all and I don't think it's
90:44 - gonna have my opinion in my unqualified
90:47 - opinion but I don't really think it's
90:50 - gonna have a huge impact on react
90:52 - I think WordPress using react was a cool
90:56 - thing and it made WordPress seem like
91:02 - seemed like it was really moving forward
91:05 - and changing and kind of I don't I don't
91:09 - want to say being more relevant cuz
91:11 - WordPress is already you know it has a
91:12 - lot of market share but it made me think
91:14 - that like WordPress was really that kind
91:17 - of forward thinking and trying to push
91:18 - things but in terms of react it didn't
91:21 - make me think very much of anything
91:23 - about react it was just one more
91:26 - organization added to the long list of
91:28 - organizations that are to use it so in
91:30 - my opinion WordPress saying they're not
91:33 - using react anymore is kind of lowers my
91:37 - opinion of WordPress but not of react if
91:40 - that makes sense
91:41 - I still like WordPress and I'll still
91:43 - use WordPress and I totally understand
91:45 - their reasoning for it and I don't know
91:50 - if I was in the same position I might do
91:51 - this do the same thing but I don't think
91:56 - it's gonna have a that big of an impact
91:59 - on on react it'll be a much bigger
92:02 - impact on on WordPress in terms of the
92:06 - direction that they'll they'll be going
92:07 - in now I don't know what they're gonna
92:09 - replace
92:09 - with but they were really seen like
92:11 - there one in the direction of at some
92:15 - point down the road the wordpress api
92:18 - would be the main way things were done
92:19 - and a lot of you'll be using a lot of
92:23 - react interacting with the api instead
92:27 - of PHP interacting with the database and
92:29 - using templates like at least that's
92:33 - that's where i thought it was gonna go
92:35 - but now i'm not sure i mean they could
92:38 - just they could start using view right i
92:40 - mean maybe they could use pre act so i
92:42 - mean they could switch something else in
92:43 - there and keep going a new but probably
92:45 - be the same but anyway i'm gonna stop
92:48 - talking because I feel like I'm in over
92:50 - my head and I'm not I'm not qualified a
92:55 - strong opinion on this
93:12 - Chasez jonbi yep it makes sense for
93:15 - their business I just wonder if it will
93:17 - be a big enough issue to slow Reax
93:19 - growth or for Facebook to change things
93:22 - yeah that's my my thoughts on it or no
93:26 - it's not gonna change anything for react
93:31 - I think Facebook's so big and they have
93:35 - so many other things they're doing like
93:36 - it just it's not it seems like a big
93:38 - deal to us because we're developers and
93:40 - like we hear about the stuff every day
93:43 - but in the grand scheme of things react
93:46 - is such a it's a small part of what
93:48 - Facebook's doing you know to the world
93:51 - right I mean when I talk to people who
93:53 - aren't developers they have no idea what
93:55 - react is they've never heard about it in
93:57 - their lives I mean I can tell them like
93:59 - hey all these other sites use it and
94:01 - they know like okay that's cool but they
94:03 - have no idea they know what Facebook is
94:06 - and they know a lot of stuff about
94:07 - Facebook but they have no idea of react
94:09 - is so so that's that's why I just I
94:12 - don't think Facebook's gonna really care
94:14 - enough they're happy to just try to
94:17 - protect themselves from lawsuits which
94:19 - is from my understanding that's why the
94:21 - their license is the way it is okay
94:29 - Laura says html5 boilerplate is like a
94:32 - template set up to quickly throw a
94:34 - website together okay so it's what I
94:35 - thought it was all right cool so so yeah
94:39 - so essentially it's it's a more kind of
94:45 - bare-bones version of what I was trying
94:46 - to do with this
94:48 - this fus homepage thing these are
94:51 - originally based on the starter template
94:53 - I made I wanted just to have some
94:55 - bare-bones stuff that somebody let's say
94:58 - like from another department so maybe
95:00 - like the new developer that's coming in
95:01 - if they wanted a starting point to go
95:03 - with it had a lot of the basic styles
95:05 - that we use and they could just put
95:07 - together a site they could just you know
95:09 - pull this down from github and and
95:12 - already have a lot of it built out or if
95:15 - we needed to go with an outside
95:18 - contractor I could just say hey like
95:21 - start with this and utilize what we have
95:25 - and then that way it would hopefully
95:27 - save us some money
95:28 - because they wouldn't and sometime we
95:32 - wouldn't have as much back and forth of
95:34 - trying to make sure that they fit the
95:35 - brand standards because they would it
95:37 - would already be built into this so like
95:42 - I said html5 boilerplate doesn't go
95:44 - quite that far it's not as opinionated
95:45 - on style like CSS and things like that
95:48 - and you know but it'll just give you
95:50 - some basic you know like this type of
95:52 - basic stuff right that you need for
95:55 - every site so I I don't recall exactly
95:57 - how much is in there but just helps you
96:02 - skip some of those really basic things
96:04 - that there's no reason you need to do
96:06 - that by hand
96:18 - okay Lord says reasoning behind react
96:24 - license makes sense but also raises some
96:26 - issues patent law is flawed and react
96:28 - license as a product of trying to
96:30 - protect against those flaws yeah that's
96:33 - a good point yeah I mean really if you
96:36 - think about a patent law was you know it
96:39 - was all developed way before you know we
96:42 - had like software like we have today or
96:44 - the internet or anything so it's it's
96:46 - definitely it makes sense that patent
96:51 - laws is not keeping up well with with
96:55 - the way things are now so it definitely
96:59 - needs to need some updating no beer says
97:15 - okay nobody's talking about text editors
97:19 - here I thought it wasn't sure for a
97:21 - second either read through that okay
97:28 - they were they were talking about
97:30 - notepad plus plus for for editing and it
97:35 - seems like it can be useful but yeah
97:40 - like I started out I started out on
97:42 - notepad just regular notepad and that
97:44 - wasn't thinking about it now that was
97:46 - insane trying to build websites with
97:48 - notepad and then I went to notepad plus
97:51 - plus and that was that was cool there
97:53 - were a lot of cool features that I was
97:54 - just kind of learning and once I
97:58 - switched though from notepad plus plus
98:00 - plus to Adam I never wanted to go back
98:03 - like it was obviously better and things
98:08 - like Adam are obviously better so I'm
98:12 - sure there are probably some cool
98:14 - features with notepad plus plus that I
98:16 - didn't know about and I never used so
98:17 - there might be some some up useful
98:19 - things I'm just missing but it was
98:22 - Mike's my experience was that I really
98:25 - liked Adam a lot better Abdul Azeez asks
98:36 - how many languages needed to learn to be
98:38 - a back-end developer so I would say it I
98:50 - mean it kind of depends so I think the
98:55 - easiest route and this is the route that
98:57 - I'm kind of taking is learning
99:03 - JavaScript front-end and back-end will
99:05 - allow you of I think the fastest route
99:09 - to full stack front-end and back-end
99:12 - because you know the syntax is all the
99:15 - same it's one it's the same language
99:17 - then you have to learn how to interact
99:18 - with a database and you just have to
99:22 - decide I guess you know what kind of
99:26 - database you want to wear
99:27 - with sequel no sequel I mean it's so I
99:32 - mean potentially you could get away with
99:35 - knowing one language and do that I mean
99:38 - obviously you're gonna be limited to
99:40 - just that language but you you could
99:44 - build you know complete apps and things
99:48 - just with JavaScript and knowing how to
99:51 - interact with some sort of database but
99:56 - it I mean it kind of depends on what you
99:58 - want to do what you want to work on and
100:01 - in that case you could go like no beer
100:04 - just mentioned PHP Ruby ASP and then
100:10 - database languages he says my sequel
100:13 - MongoDB right even things like right
100:18 - like c-sharp Java
100:21 - I'm sure there's there's other languages
100:24 - less common that are being used Python
100:28 - it's another big one I was forgetting so
100:32 - and there are some industries that use
100:35 - really like ancient programming
100:38 - languages as well so there's a lot of
100:40 - things that you could you could you
100:45 - could pick from but I mean if you wanted
100:48 - like my personal advice on it I I think
100:52 - the fastest route is full stack
100:54 - javascript is that the best in terms of
100:58 - like career-wise right now or salary I
101:01 - don't really know I'd have to you know
101:03 - see some data about that but but you
101:09 - can't deny it's easier to learn one
101:10 - language than to write
101:21 - hahaha Patrick wrote : WQ it I mentioned
101:29 - earlier that I couldn't exit them so in
101:31 - case you're not familiar with them
101:32 - that's how you exit : w kiss I remember
101:37 - it now now that you put it up there yet
101:40 - that's that's what it was
101:43 - he's been tutor for the win
101:54 - this lost my place there we go
101:57 - Blake says we should build react 2.0
102:00 - actually what are they on with three
102:02 - aren't they it's just about to release
102:04 - react 16 or something down there you
102:08 - never like see the version number it's
102:10 - always just react but I think it's
102:12 - sixteen Rijn arrow says I need help
102:20 - please can some good person help me
102:21 - understanding big o-notation pretty
102:23 - please I don't know anything about big
102:27 - o-notation but free code camp has a
102:31 - series on their YouTube channel on big
102:33 - o-notation so check out the playlists on
102:36 - this channel and if you scroll down I
102:38 - think it was it's kind of an older
102:40 - series but if you scroll down you'll see
102:42 - that there's a us I think it's a whole
102:44 - series on big o-notation if not a series
102:47 - there's at least one one video maybe
102:49 - more so check that out and I think I
102:55 - watch some of it but I ended up not
102:58 - getting through it because I thought I
102:59 - don't really need to know this right now
103:01 - I should be learning something more
103:03 - relevant to my work so but definitely
103:06 - check that out and if it's useful let me
103:09 - know and then I'll recommend it to other
103:11 - people as well
103:23 - smiler says hi where can I deploy my
103:26 - first dotnet website for studying
103:28 - purposes and like my portfolio
103:33 - [Music]
103:40 - okay so Blake says you could do it on
103:43 - cloud nine
103:45 - so it's c9i oh that's a great idea I
103:48 - wasn't thinking about that Blake but
103:50 - that's that is probably the easiest way
103:52 - to just get something up quickly
103:55 - otherwise I don't know I've actually not
103:58 - I've never deployed a dotnet website on
104:02 - my own I've always just worked on ones
104:04 - that are already deployed so so I'm I
104:09 - can't really help you that much with it
104:11 - sorry about that I dunno we have someone
104:15 - that's normally in the live chat and
104:16 - they just couldn't make it today so if
104:17 - you come back for some future live
104:20 - streams umberto who's in the live chat
104:23 - and he works with with C sharp and
104:28 - dotnet so he'd definitely be able to get
104:31 - you get you on the right track
104:40 - Ranieri says can you tell me the runtime
104:42 - for this please could you add the
104:45 - runtimes
104:55 - right now what do you mean by runtimes
104:57 - trying to screw up and see if I missed
104:59 - something
105:29 - okay
105:40 - okay so they were taught there there's a
105:44 - lot of stuff about big o-notation I'm
105:46 - not gonna read it all I'll just pick out
105:48 - some things and then we're pretty much
105:50 - at the end of the live chat so talking
105:55 - about Jambi says in response I was
105:57 - saying I don't know that much about big
105:59 - o-notation I didn't take the time to
106:00 - really learn it cuz I didn't think it
106:01 - would be useful for me at the time but
106:04 - John B says that Big O is useful it
106:07 - tells you worst case complexity for an
106:09 - algorithm gives a good indicator if an
106:11 - approach to an algorithm is bad or not
106:14 - for example like doing a for loop in a
106:18 - for loop that's bad okay that's
106:20 - interesting I didn't think about that
106:22 - now that you say that I'm starting to
106:25 - remember a little bit about what I did
106:27 - learn about Big O notation so yeah ayat
106:32 - that could I think at the time I just
106:34 - thought like wow I'm not really doing
106:35 - anything where I even need to worry
106:39 - about stuff like that I was just working
106:40 - on a lot of small like one-page websites
106:43 - that use like the only JavaScript it
106:47 - used was just for like UI interactions
106:50 - like a side nav and you know or some
106:55 - type of scroll effect or something like
106:57 - that so but I could definitely see now
107:00 - that I'm getting into some more in-depth
107:02 - things it could be useful maybe I was to
107:07 - take a look at that video series when I
107:10 - get a chance
107:26 - let's see James Moore says I appreciate
107:30 - your services no beer it says Jessie
107:34 - thanks for streaming you're welcome
107:35 - thanks for watching and thanks for
107:37 - participating in the live chat alright
107:45 - okay that's it that's the end of the
107:48 - live end of the live chat so we're gonna
107:51 - finish up the stream here thank you for
107:55 - watching everybody
107:56 - and thanks for all your help and all
108:00 - your contributions to the live chat is a
108:03 - good stream today we got done exactly
108:05 - what we intended to get done and without
108:08 - too many errors and so there's a good
108:12 - day great way to end the week so I'm
108:15 - gonna be busy this weekend
108:16 - working on some some Redux and learning
108:20 - about react native so hopefully I have
108:23 - some cool stuff to share with you on
108:25 - Monday and I hope you all have a great
108:28 - weekend hopefully not as busy as mine
108:30 - but I hope you have a fun weekend or at
108:34 - least a productive one
108:36 - and I'll be back on Monday and so have a
108:40 - great weekend

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse and I'm Jesse and we're gonna do some coding today pretty much right where we left off yesterday I've been trying to figure out how to get rid of these errors that we were having so just to do a recap for for what happened yesterday if you missed it we are trying to use the materialized CSS framework in an old website that has a lot of stuff going on a lot of different files put in by different companies and different developers and there's pretty much no documentation and so we're just learning as we go and when we tried to implement the side nav from materialized we kept getting an error so I tried commenting out different things so it really doesn't matter if I comment out the side nav function the modal throws an error and so pretty much everything that I'm trying to do from materialized doesn't work so I'm just going through and trying to remove everything I can that may be causing conflicts and hopefully hopefully something will work out so that's where I'm at just to show you see a lot of stuff on the screen right now so let me pull over here's what we have right now right so this is not this doesn't look good at all right here's the live site that we're trying to change and and this is we're gonna try to change it to well at least in terms of the header it'll definitely be a different background image this is just a stock photo but we want the header to look like that in the side and I have to look kind of like this we're gonna switch in that new logo that we used for the the last project for project 2 but other than that everything should be the same so we're here right now but once we get with the exception of some weird padding issues that I'll have to deal with once we get the the functions that come built in with materialized to work this should look a lot better so let's let's tell you what let me move this over for now and let's give it a refresh because I just did a few things before I started the stream and I haven't checked it yet all right so hey check this out so not not perfect but look at that we got we got it working so that's good news so at least some of what we're doing is working let's let's check out let's check out the console let's see Wow no errors awesome I mean other than this I I realized that that's just not gonna find that image but that's that's great alright so here's what I commented out I commented out this custom das file because I was I was looking through it and it really didn't have a lot that that I thought we needed so let me I guess it's not going to be in there anyway to get out but the it was basically doing a lot of things for components that I'm that I took out that aren't even on the page anymore so I think it should be fine maybe later on I should go through and look at it a little bit more closely just to make sure nothing was really necessary but there must have been something in there that was messing things up the only other thing I changed is I took out this version of jQuery which I thought I had already done but I guess I either didn't do it or I undid it somehow and didn't realize it so now we are using I think we're still loading two different versions of jQuery so we have this newer version for now I'm okay with that at some point we're gonna have to decide whether we want to run the older version or the newer version and how we're gonna do that we'll see what the best way to do that is let me say I had everyone in the live chat oh we got a question already so Jay rec says hey Jesse what programming language did you learn first backend I want to say the first language that I feel like I really learned to the point where I could I could build stuff that works was JavaScript and that obviously is back in with node and frontend if if you want to if you want to take learn and the really loose sense then I'd say C++ I did build a calculator in C++ before I learned how to do anything in JavaScript so but I don't other than like just the basic concept programming concepts that I learned when I took a class on C++ I don't remember much about it like syntax and things like that I haven't even looked at any C++ code probably since I took that course but it was cool because I just I remember learning things like different types of loops for loops while loops learning just a lot of the basic stuff so anyway I don't really use other languages that much I mean right now it's like some csharp stuff but am PHP I guess I I guess I have done some PHP with WordPress so I completely forgot about that but yeah I can I can do some PHP I've done like file upload like file handlers you know a handle form data and upload files with PHP so I guess I I could include that in as well I once took a little course on Java now that I think about it we built a game in the class but it was more like just a demo like we collaboratively built the game so the teacher did most of the work hey everybody okay so egos asking me about the the hack right so let me explain this so I was just I was just talking about these two different versions of JavaScript so you can't see the other one but it gets input basically through this tag here but it's an old version I think it's like one point ten or something so we I want to use the newer version but the problem is I can't find where this data is getting pulled in to change that so evo had a great idea was well why not just find where it's at you know in the file structure and then just take this file and rename it and I thought that was a really great idea until earlier today I was gonna do it and then I realized that if I did that it would change the version of jQuery on the live site and I don't want to do that because in the off chance that it does cause some weird problem I may not even know it because there's just way too many pages on the site for me to go through and check that and I wouldn't want to go through all those pages on the site it's just too slow it would take me all like days so anyway I'm not gonna do it right now I actually really want to know where this is coming from anyway because it's loading a lot of other files so we may not even need those files so that was a really good idea if this was really an actual test server instead of some weird I don't I don't even know it's it's supposed to be a test but everything I change changes the live site if I'm not careful okay hey Sebastian's back awesome so Sebastian was a regular here on this livestream in the chat but he recently went to Germany and says just got Internet awesome okay let's get started if you haven't if you haven't watched before the format is basically I do twenty five minutes of code five minutes a question to answer another 25minute session of code and then the end I do Question and Answer occasionally I'll do more code I'll go longer but today I'm just going to do the two sessions of code two sessions of questions and answers so that's what we're gonna do now and I'm gonna set a timer to help me stay on track if I can find it and I think I'm also gonna clean up these windows a bit so once I once you start working on more than one project things start to get a little bit crazy so I still have everything open from project 2 which is not done yet and now this this project I have lots of stuff open for I was working on another project earlier as well and so I have a lot going on I actually spent most of the morning going over a site it's AG it's only like a few pages but it's like a little site that we have this other company building for our single signon system and it's just really disappointed I just told them some basic things to do so it matches the style that we use on the other site just I mean really basic like literally I gave them the CSS and said here put this in and then I checked they came back and said hey we've done like everything that you asked for except for this one thing I checked and they like didn't even get 50% of it done so really disappointed and I mean this was like really basic stuff and they they couldn't even get a hover to work like a CSS hover it was yeah it was just odd I don't know how much we're paying them but I don't think I want to know I think it just made me sad so anyway I had to go through and basically in dev tools figure out to write all the code out and tell them exactly what line to replace so that this gets done I have until the end of October it's supposed to launch at the end of October so I just I mean it's not my project I'm not really gonna get credit for it but I still don't want it to look bad because it's you know it's gonna reflect the university so anyway sorry for the complaints I don't it's just I just want to find a really good like outside company that does quality work and and can understand like that things need to be precise so you can't you can't just get it like close enough especially when I'm giving very precise like I'm giving them the CSS I'm not just saying oh you know make it look pretty which is vague I'm actually saying like this is exactly what I want and anyway we've had some bad luck with different companies and websites just really really helped me find somebody good that we could stick with when we need to outsource projects okay sorry I said I was sorry for complaining and then I just went on again from the minute let's I was just cleaning up Windows so let's get the windows that you know the desktops that we're actually gonna use the most we'll get those right next to each other and so here we go get this one just one I think that's I think that's it so we'll have our code oops maybe I didn't do it right oh no it's it's right code here right here okay all right so here's what we have right now not terrible but it looks like we still have a lot of weird stuff going on with CSS so this should be up at the top I mean this should not be all moved over so we're gonna have to just go through and inspect these elements and see what in the CSS is causing it to shift around and then as a last resort we can use important on our CSS properties but a better way would be just to make our selectors more specific than what's currently in place I think that'll be that'll be the best way to do it I don't want to get into actually changing the CSS that's already there because for every file I'll have to make a test file and then I'll have to change the names right of when we're importing that and then I'll have to work on that CSS and hope that it doesn't mess something up elsewhere I won't really be able to test that at all so you can see it would be kind of a mess so and in this instance I'm gonna be very specific with my selectors so that I know it's only going to affect the stuff that we're putting in so we we may have to throw in some IDs and things and use that which I normally wouldn't do but in this case we want to make sure it doesn't cause side effects in other places okay so let's just let's start checking these things out and we'll try to make some space and let's get rid of this we don't need that right now just make as much space as we can here all right this looks good interesting yeah that is that's very interesting okay let's just check out what's going on oh I thought that the the one that I had oh well so now let's let's get this let's move this over now oh I know this is the right one I don't know what that's to you guys just get rid of it oh that's the project okay whoops I don't need this right now let's move it over man I have so as you a lot of you already know I listen to music in my headphones while I'm doing this and a country song just came on and I like pretty much all music but I'm really not a big fan of country music man how did that how did that come on but anyway pretty distracting just for a minute here but let's check out let's check out what's going on so here's our our nav rapper and let's check out our header first is that's the outside the outermost container so you can see that's down a bit and let's see where so this is our file so anything in new design we want to see that at the top and we don't want to see anything crossed out because that's our CSS also anything that's materialized mndot CSS we want to see that actually applied if we see anything crossed out on those two then we'll know that that's being overridden by something else so so far so good on the header but it looks like we have some weird stuff going on here right this is from styles dot CSS which I did not write so there we go let's check it out let's make it alright so it didn't fix it totally but it got rid of that thing at the top right so you can see we had a positionabsolute and we had top twenty right that was because right you can see in the version site we have now that it actually does have this little gap at the top so that's where we got that from so now we don't have that anymore let's see okay with a hundred percent it that that really shouldn't be a problem we could probably just leave that in there we don't need that top anymore so what we need to do though is we need to figure out what type of positioning we wanted to have and I think we're gonna go with a fixed with a fixed header let me double check yeah we wanted what this navbar to be fixed actually that's interesting that that's really odd that the navbar fixed position is not fixed okay so I guess the interior positioning is fixed we just can't tell you can't scroll right now let's see if I can make it scroll okay so that positioning is working so we're good with that all right so we still need to figure out you know this big gap on the side and I think I was thinking about this I think to some point last night and I was thinking you know when you use materialized there's a structure to the page that we just don't have here right we have all this other stuff going on so I think we need to check out what's outside of this header and just see how things are lining up and see how much of this structure we can actually change without messing things up so that's where we'll look we should probably remember what we did with this header so position we don't want absolutely we don't once house let's just say sorry position okay so static so let's go with static and okay top let's double check new design 32 oops all right so let's go to our new design whoops this is uh Jas we need our CSS you designed that CSS I'm go to 130 there we go okay so we need position static and top auto now it should override right because it's just it's the same right it's header here header here and we're loading this after so the cascading nature of skating stylesheets should take effect and what we have will override what's there so let's refresh just to doublecheck yep and there we go so all right so there's one salt you can see how tedious this process is gonna be we may we may end up only getting a new header we'll see I hope to do like an entirely new homepage but that if it keeps going at this pace then it's gonna be tough hopefully as we go along we'll we'll have less you know maybe we'll figure out a lot of what's what's going on and what's causing this and it won't be as big of a deal okay actually I just thought to check to make sure that this this is working and it is now if you remember we we have not actually added these the way we want to yeah well sorry I really haven't gone all day and now I'm yawning during the stream so I'm gonna drink some some G fuel if you're not familiar with G fuel it's like a fivehour energy except it's powder and you mix it with water just a lot of vitamins and caffeine okay so we still need right these are all hardcoded right now so that's not what we want so we still need to add put that in but before we couldn't even see this to tell if what we were doing was working so we're gonna do that since we're already kind of into the CSS let's do a little bit more of this and get it to the point where it looks about like it should and then we'll just try to put in some of that stuff from the template that'll give us these links I'd like it if we could get the links just like this but as long as we can get close to that I'll be happy with that too I'm kind of hoping that we can reevaluate some of these links when we redo this but we'll see evidently when before I was here when this site underwent a redesign the last time figuring out what links get in the top navigation on the homepage was a huge deal like every department one of their stuff on the front and so don't really want to go into that again if we don't have to but I think it could use a bit of cleaning up all right so let's check out if we're doing yours so we have this inner page outer see that this may be messing us up a bit it's C I may have to just put this on the other screen for a second just so I can see okay all right check this out you see that so we've got we've got some weird margins going on here I'm guessing yep there it is okay so I was guessing there is a max width on this and there it is there's a max width and it's set to zero Auto so anything in there can't go past there so that's why we're cut off at least on this side some reason we're overflowing here on the other side which is good shoot I click the link okay we're back so let's mess around with this a bit max with there we go awesome alright so check that out look it works let's make sure this works cool oh man why is it always so I don't know what's over there that I keep clicking but alright so that works so here's what we're gonna do we what's above this okay so let's check what we're doing to materialize right now because this could take that I think in materialize the way you structure it is there's a main component I can't remember if header is supposed to be inside of main or not and so let me double check that and then that'll determine what I want to do with this div so I think I have it I guess it's this way here we go so let's see what how we structured it here okay so here's our header and there's main below it and then it's just bought ietter mein okay I think we're gonna try to completely get rid of this inner page out of wrap or a page outline thing okay I imagine it might mess some other things up but we'll see so what I want to do is get rid of this completely so that our header well we have two options either we can try to move the header up so it's outside of this and then make this our main so try to basically just add the class main to this and see if we can override the other styles or get rid of it completely and you know put in a main down here so we'll see what's easier once we check this out so let's go back to our be our main main test master so let's try to find that what was that called inner page see if we can find it here in their page there we go okay awesome so it looks like we could yeah we could just move this up I'm guessing that everything that I do needs to be inside this form so I'm gonna put it inside the form for now I'm not sure Umberto's not in the live chat and he's he's good with csharp but if anybody knows I think when we're doing stuff with like dotnet everything's got to be inside this form so that's what I'm gonna do it like that for now and I think it should work and I'm gonna the indentation in this file is just ridiculous I don't know how this happened but it was like that before we started also I still haven't all right let's save that but then let's let's get the important stuff out of the way first we have got to change these settings so that it uses spaces instead of tabs so let's see there we go tab size needs to be equal to 2 oops the editing in Visual Studio code is actually pretty cool all the way copy the settings sure so just kind of as an aside here if you never done editing and visual studio code it's kind of cool I like it so you have your settings JSON and here on on this panel they give you all the settings and you can search them and it gives you a description then you can click over here to edit and it copies it over to kind of like your settings file that just overrides all the other stuff right so this is where you put you know your custom settings and so it's pretty cool like you'd see like I am what did I do I put in here I changed something in my user settings and I can't find it but anyway it's somewhere in my settings I took away the the map like the minimap thing that was on the sides it was taken away too much space but it's really cool pretty much anything in the UI you can change from there so all right so let's test this out maybe it didn't work it does not look like it worked no all right maybe I need to restart for it to take effect we'll see I'm gonna just double check that it actually yeah it's in there the settings overridden based on the file contents when editor detected annotation okay so since that file already has that kind of indentation that's why it's doing that so I'm gonna leave that alone we're just going to be stuck with that but going forward for new files we have in Visual Studio code will have the same indentation that I'm used to using alright so now that we've we've changed this let's see what things look like all right great let's make sure oh nice and look at that before I don't know if you remember but the overlay was coming over top of this and now it's not so that's that's awesome at least at some point it was coming over top of it great and there it is there's that that link so I'm getting I'm gonna have to fix that something's that's not how it's supposed to work so that's that's a minor thing I'll just fix that later but anyway double check okay great that's working so when you click on one over here it opens a side bar and it automatically opens up that all these sub links wonderful great alright instead of some weird stuff like the color of links is when you hover changes to blue we don't want that but not bad so here's the next step let's try to populate the links in the side nav from the link the data that we're getting from from our content management system and we need the we need to put in the logo too so we'll figure out where to where to bring that logo in at and actually I think we're using an SVG logo it's a pretty long SVG but we can potentially just copy and paste the SVG stuff right in there we'll see I might do that okay so for now we need to go to our I'm main nav test I just we need to look at what's going on here and figure out where to put these so okay I'm still somewhat familiar with what the markup looks like on the the main site so this section I guess I'll show you all what it what it looks like so it was just make a lot of sense if we just take a look for a second so we have these these links here then we have this menu here down here these are the the bottom links that they're talking about so for each one of these we need to get all of these sub links and then the bottom links as well and put them in that side nav under there so this is where keep on the wrong way so this is where we're getting this bottom links so in this green box menu hey at least the ternary operator is the same as it is in JavaScript let's see that's good I understand something so if you're not familiar with the ternary this is basically like an if statement so it's if this is true then do this which in this case is put in this little bit of markup if it's not true then do this okay so you might be able to copy this actually my the timer went up so before I get into this let's do the five minute five minutes a question answer and then we'll get back and we'll start copying some of these and putting them up in our code up here and seeing if we can get this if we can get it working okay let me find my timer there we go do our short break all right I'm gonna scroll up I'm probably not gonna get through everything in this five minutes but if I don't get to your question now I'll get to it at the end of the stream you know like there's a lot of talking going on a lot of chat but not a lot of questions okay here's a question rich rich Bob says is Ubuntu better than Windows and I would say it just kind of depends on what your preferences are I mean you could probably match them up like headtohead on certain things and say you know one's better than the other at certain things but I I really only use Linux for servers and not as I mean if we're comparing servers I definitely prefer Linux servers like an abuti server over a Windows server but I don't have enough experience with linux desktops to be able to really say one way or another evo says I find it it is harder with Linux because you need to have a pretty deep understanding of all your your tools on Windows it's pretty much all done for you okay yeah that makes sense from what I've heard from people who do use Linux for desktop it's like if if you like handling a lot of that stuff then it's really good but if you just want something you can just turn on and it'll work and and you don't have to worry about it then windows might be the way to go although if you want something that just turns on it just works a Mac is probably the way to go I've never had other than a Chromebook I've never had something that just starts up so fast and is reliable there's definitely drawbacks as well like how much it costs but and the lack of being able to customize things but it's definitely reliable okay all right so you have let me see some questions so sy asks does he look at the chat and I think someone else already answered but I'll just reiterate that that yeah I do look at the chat so at the beginning of the stream I spend most of the time coding I will take a break halfway through and answer questions and then at the end of the stream we'll get to all the questions so and then occasionally I do look over when I'm coding it just so happened that this coding session this first one I I didn't really look over very often Jordan asks what we're building basically we're not really like building anything we're just kind of trying to improve an existing website so it's an older website it's built on some older technology we're trying to go in going in there and we're giving it a facelift and trying to make it a little bit faster so we're gonna add some material design style UI and try to just get rid of as much as much code as we can that's unnecessary there's a lot of files being loaded there's a lot of images being loaded we want to just clean up that UI get rid of a lot of it and just do what we can I mean this site's probably a year or so away from being totally redone anyway so we just need to keep it going and and make it look a little bit better and until till we can get to the point where we're gonna redo it totally Daniel asks is there any way we can help you out I said Daniel I don't I don't know if you were referring to helping me out or helping someone out in the chat but if anybody right now this project is kind of hard to collaborate on because I don't have a whole lot on github right now like I have this on github and I have a I think I have this linked in the description the fu s starter template that's on github and it has things like in this menu but I'm working on getting some version of of this and github I just what I want to make sure that I leave out any of the config files and because that has like database passwords and usernames and things in there so I want to just be really careful about making sure I don't put anything that I shouldn't I don't get hope so when I get a chance I'm gonna put some of this out here and then at least you'll have a chance to check it out will you be able to run it probably not because you'll need you'll need Ektron which nobody has Ektron it cost a lot of money and there's like no one in my mind there's no reason for anyone to use a cron anymore it's it's not a great system compared to what we have now who knows maybe well at one point in the past it was a really awesome system but now it's it's definitely shows its age so alright so I got through I don't know about 3/4 of what's in the live chat so I'm gonna go back and do a little bit more coding another 25minute session and then I'll go through everything in the live chat so I'm gonna write down where I stopped so I don't doesn't take me forever to find it okay there was some talk about whether I respond to comments and slack or in a live chat I do check in on the slack Channel when I can but that's I usually don't check slack during the stream so that's all you know if you want to send a message or something when I'm not streaming slacks the way to go if I am streaming go ahead and put it in the live chat and I'll check that the same goes for anything else so Twitter or any social media channels I I know almost never check that while I'm streaming but I I do try to get to it after before and after Xtreme it was just odd somebody from business services department here just called but hung up after one ring so that's that's fine with me I want a code okay let's where's my timer okay let's set that timer again and now let's let's just start copying some things over I think let's see so you know what this repeater and right now I'm trying to find what the outermost element is here okay so all right let's check on yeah let's check some of these so it's inspected I just want to see the structure of it okay so here's that mega menu div inside there that's where we have to you ELLs that are coming and now so let's check that so here's that mega menu div and then okay there's another item template with another repeater okay so really this is going to be kind of like the bottom most level this this item sounds late okay in this repeater we'll need this repeater as well let's check out Mega Man you don't see ya I may not need any of these outer things double check actually I think we should do that okay so will once like this okay I'm gonna I'm gonna move this over to my other screen so I can see it and look at the code at the same time so here's what we'll do so we definitely want we want all of this but we're just gonna have to change like these I have to change these to match what we're doing up here so that's I could split this let me let me check out I think this is just okay so this is a big list these are all allies okay so we can keep this structure of allies so there's one one ul over everything and then okay so we'll have to keep our URL because they're not there's not a where I'm sorry our ul our unordered list this outermost because that's not being it put in by this template the first thing they put in is this Li and that'll be these allies for us and then right now it's putting in an a tag and a link but we don't want that right so let's let's see what we're doing so what we want we want the a tag but we don't want it to be a link so let me just bring this down here just so that we have a reference so we'll reference that right here so here's what we want let's remove this href and our class we don't need to bring in a class dynamically it's only just gonna have the class collapsible header and then for the data URL we're just gonna call that faith section there we go and then we need the name and we definitely don't want this image i was actually i actually already hid that on the main site because it looks just so old and terrible i guess we don't need the span either rid of that and there we go and that's the name so that's what we need awesome so that one's taken care of so that's that's going to be all of our our top level headers for our side nav right and now we need to get to these that are inside here so for right now in my markup I actually have multiple unordered lists but if we can do it differently I think it would be better it makes more sense to just have one unordered list so let's see how how we can do it so now we have underneath the allies let's check what we have here so underneath the Li a a tag we have this div that's collapsible body so let's let's just copy that and bring it down here and instead of so if it has child taxonomy then we're gonna say I think this is the point where we'll want to put the collapsible yeah so instead of this mega menu div we're gonna put our collapsible body div right there okay this is collapsible body and I'll need to escape these there we go just okay so I since I was using double quotes and then double quotes inside you have to escape them I'm not really sure how it works and with.net if I could have used like single quotes in here maybe I could've but I decided just to do it like this since it's being done down here and I know it works like that all right so now we'll have for every it looks like for every section that actually has links sublinks it'll add this div that's collapsible body if it doesn't have sub links it won't it won't add anything which for right now everything will have sub link so we'll just keep going alright so we have another item template here that's gonna add okay so here's here's where we can we can change this a bit since we want one ul yeah one ul we can change this up get first submenu item class now this is this is kind of confusing okay so there should be allies within this I'm not sure where they're coming in at probably coming in on that that dot CS file so so let's do this let's move a ul up here yeah we'll get rid of this div we'll get rid of this you l will move it up here and then then it should put in a lies beneath that yeah let's double check our markup here collapse body ul and these are just allies with a tags in the middle okay that should work that that's exactly that's exactly what we want okay so let's do that we need this green box menu I need all right let's try something out I'm wondering if we can get rid of just completely get rid of all of that and just and yeah I think we can so we'll leave this for Peter here but then for this we can just get rid of a whole thing and we can get rid of is that it no that's not it this was a closing tags these closing tags now we'll put here a ul and I don't think yeah we just needed you out so we'll open our ul up here and then we'll close it here so inside that div okay now this should just output allies in this same way we want it to here so let's say that and what we can do is we can just check out what gets outputted here without having to change any of this yet okay so let me refresh hopefully no errors will see nice okay so this is looking looking pretty good so far so let me bring this over so y'all can see the structure so this is what we wanted we wanted these sections right we have the the UL okay awesome so here we go that we have all these here the only thing I'm not sure about is is that that first section did we have that all we did have that but it was last oh you know what that's uh that's this one that we left in here let me take that out I was confusing me okay let's give it a refresh and should be should be alright now I just got a slack message from the project manager so let's see you have to replace the character with so I have this file uploader right and if someone uploads a file with a dot in it with a period in it other than the file extension then she gets an error when she tries to get the file I can't remember what I replaced it with let's see so you get an error let me see I think if you used to take out I thought if you just took out the dot that it would work maybe I changed the dot too no I didn't oh I don't know I will all right I'll get to that I mean all right so I was okay cool I just want to check to make sure it wasn't an emergency otherwise we were gonna be switching gears a little bit and doing something else on this stream okay but not an emergency so let's sorry it's just just let her know I will be able to get the file alright so this is working so now what we want to do is actually put this inside actually put this inside here so if you remember we need to keep this outer UL but then everything else can go so let's do that is this the outer one yep okay so here's our outer UL and let me double check actually I think I think we're taking out too many us not we are let me yeah okay so it's not we want to keep this ul this Li I'm gonna keep it this you oh okay so this is that one so just a bit from this Li up we'll take that out okay this is always tough to do especially when it when I'm on the like the the trackpad for a Mac select bodies here the mouse okay is this it yep that's it okay take all that out and replace it with this and everything should work save it refresh whoa check that out all right awesome let's make sure all right there's links look good nah haze all right cool so we've successfully figured out how everything is coming into these templates and we've been able to adapt it to fit the materialise you know side nav component and I know I said this for the last couple of streams but this is really it feels a cometlike reacts right we basically just popped in you know our data there's some weird stuff going on that's definitely not react like but we know enough now that I think we can do this we can build out you know this homepage so not bad see how much time I have and go from there all right about three minutes maybe I'm saying three minutes I'm not sure how much I get done we do need a logo actually let me okay want to double check and make sure that that still works yep that works too awesome if you do need a logo to go there hmm it's probably gonna take me three minutes to find that logo so that's probably not gonna work out so I think what I'll do is I'm just going to start the question answer session a few minutes early and yeah that's good I this was not bad you know on a Friday I got everything done I got it done sooner than I thought I would it works so this may be my most successful stream ever but right now I'm gonna scroll up I'm gonna so if you have a question please put in the live chat right now if you don't have a question you'd be great if you could stick around and help answer some questions I would certainly value having your expertise here if you can't stick around for the question answer session I totally understand thank you so much for watching and I'll be back on Monday probably around sometime around 200 p.m. Eastern Time you can subscribe to the free camps Channel and you'll get an alert whenever I schedule the next stream or you could you could also follow me on Twitter and I always tweet right after I schedule stream I put out a tweet and I let you all know what I'm gonna be doing that day and when I'm gonna do it and I provide a link to the live stream okay okay okay let's see web some okay so we have a question rich rich OGG says is webstorm good I've never used webstorm so that'll have to be I don't have to be answered by those in the live chat because I I just don't know very much at all about it Jordan asked why why dotnet it was not my choice that just happens to be what this site was built in so I'm not allowed to completely rebuild the site from the ground up yet so from now my job is just to make do with what we have and make it make it faster and prettier and hopefully more user friendly as best I can with with what we have so so that's why I'm working with dotnet right now hopefully the next time I work on this site will be back with react and that we'll be doing will be doing everything at that point we'll probably like back in front end everything to build this if a question from MH r says best text editors best text editors for JavaScript PHP etc I like I like atom that's like my main editor but I'm using Visual Studio code right now I also like that I'm still not really that used to Visual Studio code so sorry uhhuh kept feeling that sneeze coming on us hoping we just go away okay so I'm not that used to Visual Studio code yet I like it and I can see a lot of potential in it I'm not sure it hasn't been out as long as Adams so I'm not sure like in terms of the the package ecosystem of you know it doesn't have as much available for customization in terms of like packages already made I don't really know iii go with those two I've heard though that sublime is good a lot a lot of people it seems like a lot of people that do videos on YouTube use sublime those are really the only ones that I'm familiar with I used to use notepad plus plus back in the day I don't really recommend it but it was better than regular notepad starting out okay so Shay says hey Jessi what made you settle on react and material design for the new university sites and thoughts of WordPress moving away from reactants just announced okay so for the first question for the material design aspect of it I needed so we don't have any web designers here at the University so basically when I was hired we didn't really have like a standard a fully developed standard so we had all you know different sites with you know really different I don't know they they just looked they had some elements that were similar but I mean they they just looked really weird and they had like not even that the hex colors weren't even the same sometimes so it was just kind of a little bit of a mess so I knew we needed like we needed something that could be cohesive right but I I had to develop these sites mainly that like my main job was I had to actually build it you know I had to develop that mostly frontend but even sometimes backend stuff so I knew like I needed to just settle on a premade system that I knew worked and I could go with so I liked material design I thought it was nice it was simple the docks are very clear and easy to understand there are also like frameworks like materialized that were really easy to use and you know developed I mean when I first started using and it was in the early stages so there were some buggy stuff but I mean now it's pretty reliable so I just I chose you know it shows the material design because you know it seemed to me like a very simple well known design that users would be familiar with already so they wouldn't have to guess what they're supposed to do or what different things and the site you know they I like the idea that it's so widely used that you make sure user immediately familiar with your UI I didn't want people to have to guess what they're supposed to do so anyway that's what I went with I'm sure there there are other things I could have gone with but I'm not I'm happy with with going with material design in terms of react react was the decision to go with react came later I mean I knew like everybody kept hearing about react so I knew like when if when I first started hearing about it it was this cool thing but I wasn't sure I mean you know you know how it is like there's always new new things coming and going with JavaScript but it just kept staying around and getting bigger and bigger and then I'd hear more about it and then it'd be like every talk at a conference was talking about react and you know all these videos on YouTube we're talking about react and so then I just I started I started using I started messing around with it and I build I build some stuff with it I built like a site or for a client with it got familiar with it I really started to like it and I I like that there's so many people using it because there's there's always a lot of information if I have a problem with something in react I can usually find the answer very quickly I'm not saying reacts the only system like that but it's it's nice so I mean there are some other systems that I could use besides react but they just don't have that user base so that's kind of why with react I mean it's not it's not really like I sat down and really evaluated all the different systems it was just kind of going with you know I've used this a little bit I've used that a little bit what's really gonna work for us right now and what's likely to be to stick around for a while in the future right I don't want to like with the site we have right now we're in a position where the CMS that we use Ektron their company got bought out by another company I'm not even sure you know what the supports like if there's still updates like it's basically a dead content management system right there's not really anybody that works on it there are very few companies and developers that work with that system so you're kind of stuck and end up having to pay a lot of money for work that in my opinion from looking at the work isn't really that great so I don't want to be in that situation again so right now trying to find a react developer is a lot easier than trying to find let's say like an extra one right so I don't know I think it sets us up in a good position to be able to bring people on either as employees or as like contract workers that will be familiar with our system they'll be familiar with material design they'll be familiar with react so now that was what kind of my thoughts just kind of thinking ahead as to you know what's and that's the same way we went with like WordPress for a lot of handling a lot of our data as a content management system we could have gone with some other stuff we use Drupal for some other sites that have been built you know by outside contractors but I like to stay with WordPress because it has the largest market share right now among CMS's at least at least last time I checked I think it had the largest market share so once again if I needed to hire somebody to work on that my odds of finding a wordpress developer are greater than finding a developer of probably any other type of CMS right now so the next part this ended up being a long answer to the question so I mean they were there really like three questions here so the third question thoughts of moving WordPress away of WordPress moving away from react that's the first I heard of it I haven't seen anything about it so I have I guess I don't have any thoughts because I don't have any details right now my first reaction was is this about the react license I don't know I mean I but I have no idea I'll have to I'll have to find out more about it but I'm really interested to see what their reasoning is though if it's just about the licensing I'm not that worried about it because I mean I'm a little guy I'm not I'm not gonna be on anybody's radar with anything I'm doing I'm just I'm not worried about that but I could see why WordPress might be worried about that jonbi says my favorite text editor is a stone tablet and a chisel that's oldschool I had a meeting one time when I was doing some like subcontracting work for a media marketing company and we had a Skype meeting with everybody that worked for this place were all like remote workers so we had a Skype meeting try to get everybody together to talk to each other because we had never met met before there were people working that with this company that I had never met in my life and they they heard me they liked they heard the sound of my pen writing on a paper and they were all like what are you doing you seriously use paper they were all shocked that I still used paper especially in a Skype meeting so sometimes it's nice I've never gone so old old school to use you know a chisel but I I can understand wanting to you know physically you know leave some marks on something let's see Rishabh says what is html5 boilerplate actually I'm thinking so John Hutten in John Hanson says a boiler plate is a node NPM install environment many out there maybe you mean a keystroke shortcut for HTML and your editor yeah I'm not sure I guess maybe I don't know for sure but I thought html5 boilerplate was just like a starter like some markup just to get you started that just has some of the basic stuff you need I like something similar to what like now I don't really know I might have to look this up now because I maybe I'm secondguessing what I thought html5 boilerplate was I'll look it up after this jadyn all right now Jambi says what resource have you been using to learn csharp slash asp.net umberto I've been using umberto in the live stream that's that's my resource so he's not here right now but he's gonna he's actually on a flight right now to Denver so he sent me a message earlier to let me know he wouldn't be in the chat so he'll probably hear this later but that's pretty much it I I've I've been relying on Umberto's expertise and your help in the live chat mainly because I I don't see the benefit of me learning that much of it right now because for two reasons one this is right now is the only site that I'll ever need to work on in the foreseeable future that uses dotnet csharp the second reason is we're getting we hired a new web developer he won't be in my department he's gonna work in another department here but his job is gonna be to handle all like the dotnet csharp stuff so he starts October 2nd that's just in a couple of weeks so if any if I need any help with that I'm supposed to go go to him and I'm gonna handle you know a lot of the all the react stuff that we've been doing like that's gonna be my domain and I'm gonna be in charge of making sure that the branding standards on the web like the style guide is all enforced so this other guy's gonna handle the C sharp and dotnet stuff and then he's gonna come to me when he needs more like frontend design related stuff so that's how it's gonna work out so I just don't see the benefit right now and me spending a lot of time learning something that I'm not likely to use so I just kind of want to learn enough to get by and get this to a point where it's better I mean honestly it's not really gonna be that hard to make it better than it is right now cuz it's really slow right now but I want to try to make it as good as I can without wasting my time learning something so right now all of my learning time is going into learning react so I'm learning Redux right now and I just started learning react native like maybe two days ago I started on the react native part of the course I'm taking so and that's what I'll be doing after work today and all day Saturday and so hopefully I'll have hopefully I'll have a Redux project finished and then maybe on Monday I can show you all it's already in on my github so like my personal github account has its like Udacity readable or something if you want to check it out the design on it is really crazy in old school so I think I will show you all when I'm ready to finished just just for fun definitely not material design okay Shree Kampf asks is this the new project yes it is the new project James Moore says is learning asp.net MVC advantageous as a frontend developer it depends on what you want to do I guess I usually say when I'm asked about what what to learn really is it just depends so if you like working with this stuff or if you know of a company you really want to work for that uses it then yeah it would be advantageous if if you're talking though more in general what's that meant Aegis for a frontend developer I'd say focus on JavaScript because as a frontend developer you're pretty much always going to be using javascript no matter what else you're using you know Java scripts everywhere so I mean obviously HTML and CSS right you have to know that but those are a little bit easier to learn enough to be decent with but I would say if you're not sure exactly what you want to do but you know you want to do frontend stick with JavaScript and then once you start to get an idea of what you like then you can choose something else to pick up as well but I wouldn't if someone just came up and said hey I want to be a friend of developer what would I learn I probably never say dotnet that would not be first on my list okay there there's been like a running discussion about text editors throughout the live chat and now Lara says surely vim or Emacs is the best it's always I feel like we've had this discussion so many times on the live chat about about editors I really just need to do a video about editors and then just refer people to that but honestly I know I've already said what editors I use and what I like I've seen people use them and it looks really cool so I like them I have no idea how to use them I've never used X I tried to use it once and I know everybody says this and it's a joke but I honestly did have trouble exiting them right it looks like so I've just never really had the time to be able to try to learn it one day maybe one day I want to be you know the person that does a live demo at a conference using them and looks awesome like but so I don't disagree that BAM and I think Emacs is a similar situation and you see somebody using Emacs you're like wow Emacs and then so let's see okay so John B says the WordPress issue is about the react license yes they decided to go away from react so as not to propagate the issues of the patent issue to anyone who uses Gutenberg the WordPress tool okay that makes sense yeah that makes a lot of sense that's what I figured so basically now that I know for sure that it was the patent issue my thoughts on the whole WordPress moving away from react thing is one I'm like kind of disappointed because I was excited about WordPress using react so much but in terms of the impact this is gonna have on react in general and on my use of it is it's not gonna impact my use of it at all and I don't think it's gonna have my opinion in my unqualified opinion but I don't really think it's gonna have a huge impact on react I think WordPress using react was a cool thing and it made WordPress seem like seemed like it was really moving forward and changing and kind of I don't I don't want to say being more relevant cuz WordPress is already you know it has a lot of market share but it made me think that like WordPress was really that kind of forward thinking and trying to push things but in terms of react it didn't make me think very much of anything about react it was just one more organization added to the long list of organizations that are to use it so in my opinion WordPress saying they're not using react anymore is kind of lowers my opinion of WordPress but not of react if that makes sense I still like WordPress and I'll still use WordPress and I totally understand their reasoning for it and I don't know if I was in the same position I might do this do the same thing but I don't think it's gonna have a that big of an impact on on react it'll be a much bigger impact on on WordPress in terms of the direction that they'll they'll be going in now I don't know what they're gonna replace with but they were really seen like there one in the direction of at some point down the road the wordpress api would be the main way things were done and a lot of you'll be using a lot of react interacting with the api instead of PHP interacting with the database and using templates like at least that's that's where i thought it was gonna go but now i'm not sure i mean they could just they could start using view right i mean maybe they could use pre act so i mean they could switch something else in there and keep going a new but probably be the same but anyway i'm gonna stop talking because I feel like I'm in over my head and I'm not I'm not qualified a strong opinion on this Chasez jonbi yep it makes sense for their business I just wonder if it will be a big enough issue to slow Reax growth or for Facebook to change things yeah that's my my thoughts on it or no it's not gonna change anything for react I think Facebook's so big and they have so many other things they're doing like it just it's not it seems like a big deal to us because we're developers and like we hear about the stuff every day but in the grand scheme of things react is such a it's a small part of what Facebook's doing you know to the world right I mean when I talk to people who aren't developers they have no idea what react is they've never heard about it in their lives I mean I can tell them like hey all these other sites use it and they know like okay that's cool but they have no idea they know what Facebook is and they know a lot of stuff about Facebook but they have no idea of react is so so that's that's why I just I don't think Facebook's gonna really care enough they're happy to just try to protect themselves from lawsuits which is from my understanding that's why the their license is the way it is okay Laura says html5 boilerplate is like a template set up to quickly throw a website together okay so it's what I thought it was all right cool so so yeah so essentially it's it's a more kind of barebones version of what I was trying to do with this this fus homepage thing these are originally based on the starter template I made I wanted just to have some barebones stuff that somebody let's say like from another department so maybe like the new developer that's coming in if they wanted a starting point to go with it had a lot of the basic styles that we use and they could just put together a site they could just you know pull this down from github and and already have a lot of it built out or if we needed to go with an outside contractor I could just say hey like start with this and utilize what we have and then that way it would hopefully save us some money because they wouldn't and sometime we wouldn't have as much back and forth of trying to make sure that they fit the brand standards because they would it would already be built into this so like I said html5 boilerplate doesn't go quite that far it's not as opinionated on style like CSS and things like that and you know but it'll just give you some basic you know like this type of basic stuff right that you need for every site so I I don't recall exactly how much is in there but just helps you skip some of those really basic things that there's no reason you need to do that by hand okay Lord says reasoning behind react license makes sense but also raises some issues patent law is flawed and react license as a product of trying to protect against those flaws yeah that's a good point yeah I mean really if you think about a patent law was you know it was all developed way before you know we had like software like we have today or the internet or anything so it's it's definitely it makes sense that patent laws is not keeping up well with with the way things are now so it definitely needs to need some updating no beer says okay nobody's talking about text editors here I thought it wasn't sure for a second either read through that okay they were they were talking about notepad plus plus for for editing and it seems like it can be useful but yeah like I started out I started out on notepad just regular notepad and that wasn't thinking about it now that was insane trying to build websites with notepad and then I went to notepad plus plus and that was that was cool there were a lot of cool features that I was just kind of learning and once I switched though from notepad plus plus plus to Adam I never wanted to go back like it was obviously better and things like Adam are obviously better so I'm sure there are probably some cool features with notepad plus plus that I didn't know about and I never used so there might be some some up useful things I'm just missing but it was Mike's my experience was that I really liked Adam a lot better Abdul Azeez asks how many languages needed to learn to be a backend developer so I would say it I mean it kind of depends so I think the easiest route and this is the route that I'm kind of taking is learning JavaScript frontend and backend will allow you of I think the fastest route to full stack frontend and backend because you know the syntax is all the same it's one it's the same language then you have to learn how to interact with a database and you just have to decide I guess you know what kind of database you want to wear with sequel no sequel I mean it's so I mean potentially you could get away with knowing one language and do that I mean obviously you're gonna be limited to just that language but you you could build you know complete apps and things just with JavaScript and knowing how to interact with some sort of database but it I mean it kind of depends on what you want to do what you want to work on and in that case you could go like no beer just mentioned PHP Ruby ASP and then database languages he says my sequel MongoDB right even things like right like csharp Java I'm sure there's there's other languages less common that are being used Python it's another big one I was forgetting so and there are some industries that use really like ancient programming languages as well so there's a lot of things that you could you could you could pick from but I mean if you wanted like my personal advice on it I I think the fastest route is full stack javascript is that the best in terms of like careerwise right now or salary I don't really know I'd have to you know see some data about that but but you can't deny it's easier to learn one language than to write hahaha Patrick wrote WQ it I mentioned earlier that I couldn't exit them so in case you're not familiar with them that's how you exit w kiss I remember it now now that you put it up there yet that's that's what it was he's been tutor for the win this lost my place there we go Blake says we should build react 2.0 actually what are they on with three aren't they it's just about to release react 16 or something down there you never like see the version number it's always just react but I think it's sixteen Rijn arrow says I need help please can some good person help me understanding big onotation pretty please I don't know anything about big onotation but free code camp has a series on their YouTube channel on big onotation so check out the playlists on this channel and if you scroll down I think it was it's kind of an older series but if you scroll down you'll see that there's a us I think it's a whole series on big onotation if not a series there's at least one one video maybe more so check that out and I think I watch some of it but I ended up not getting through it because I thought I don't really need to know this right now I should be learning something more relevant to my work so but definitely check that out and if it's useful let me know and then I'll recommend it to other people as well smiler says hi where can I deploy my first dotnet website for studying purposes and like my portfolio okay so Blake says you could do it on cloud nine so it's c9i oh that's a great idea I wasn't thinking about that Blake but that's that is probably the easiest way to just get something up quickly otherwise I don't know I've actually not I've never deployed a dotnet website on my own I've always just worked on ones that are already deployed so so I'm I can't really help you that much with it sorry about that I dunno we have someone that's normally in the live chat and they just couldn't make it today so if you come back for some future live streams umberto who's in the live chat and he works with with C sharp and dotnet so he'd definitely be able to get you get you on the right track Ranieri says can you tell me the runtime for this please could you add the runtimes right now what do you mean by runtimes trying to screw up and see if I missed something okay okay so they were taught there there's a lot of stuff about big onotation I'm not gonna read it all I'll just pick out some things and then we're pretty much at the end of the live chat so talking about Jambi says in response I was saying I don't know that much about big onotation I didn't take the time to really learn it cuz I didn't think it would be useful for me at the time but John B says that Big O is useful it tells you worst case complexity for an algorithm gives a good indicator if an approach to an algorithm is bad or not for example like doing a for loop in a for loop that's bad okay that's interesting I didn't think about that now that you say that I'm starting to remember a little bit about what I did learn about Big O notation so yeah ayat that could I think at the time I just thought like wow I'm not really doing anything where I even need to worry about stuff like that I was just working on a lot of small like onepage websites that use like the only JavaScript it used was just for like UI interactions like a side nav and you know or some type of scroll effect or something like that so but I could definitely see now that I'm getting into some more indepth things it could be useful maybe I was to take a look at that video series when I get a chance let's see James Moore says I appreciate your services no beer it says Jessie thanks for streaming you're welcome thanks for watching and thanks for participating in the live chat alright okay that's it that's the end of the live end of the live chat so we're gonna finish up the stream here thank you for watching everybody and thanks for all your help and all your contributions to the live chat is a good stream today we got done exactly what we intended to get done and without too many errors and so there's a good day great way to end the week so I'm gonna be busy this weekend working on some some Redux and learning about react native so hopefully I have some cool stuff to share with you on Monday and I hope you all have a great weekend hopefully not as busy as mine but I hope you have a fun weekend or at least a productive one and I'll be back on Monday and so have a great weekend
