00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:10 - going to do something a little bit
00:12 - different i don't think we've ever
00:14 - dedicated an entire show
00:17 - to planning
00:19 - but it's going to be collaborative
00:21 - planning
00:22 - so i i expect and i hope that there will
00:24 - be a lot of input from you
00:28 - and i'll start out by giving you
00:30 - a rough sketch of what i think we should
00:32 - do to deploy the various parts of this
00:35 - project that we've been working on for
00:38 - for months now
00:40 - um
00:41 - and then
00:43 - i want to get your input
00:44 - to see you know is that plan even
00:46 - reasonable is there something i'm
00:48 - missing like maybe something that could
00:50 - go wrong or some better way to do it and
00:53 - then i'd like to take each piece and
00:55 - come up with a backup plan
00:57 - because you never know what could happen
01:01 - so i want to have a fallback and this
01:03 - will all be in preparation for the
01:05 - upcoming launch in june
01:08 - and i figure once we break things down
01:10 - and have a plan then in future streams
01:14 - we can dedicate a stream to each piece
01:17 - of the plan deploy it all together
01:19 - i'd also like to maybe do some tutorial
01:22 - videos that aren't live that are a
01:24 - little bit more well thought out and
01:26 - don't include all my normal mistakes so
01:29 - after we do a stream
01:31 - uh then and i get it to work then maybe
01:34 - i'll repeat the process with a test
01:36 - you know version and then
01:39 - have that video on my youtube channel
01:41 - that way it'll be a little bit easier
01:43 - for you all to go back and and reference
01:45 - if you want to do it yourself
01:48 - okay so
01:51 - great looks like we're up to a good
01:54 - amount of viewers here
01:56 - so i do want to say
01:57 - last week i didn't stream very much i
01:59 - think only once that's because i was at
02:02 - the revolution conference in virginia
02:04 - beach which was an awesome conference
02:07 - and
02:09 - if anybody gets a chance to go to that
02:10 - conference next year i definitely
02:12 - recommend it one of my favorite
02:14 - conferences uh the people there were
02:16 - very nice and i i attended
02:20 - a whole day of workshops on the second
02:22 - day of the conference and learned some
02:24 - really awesome things like i built an
02:26 - alexa skill
02:27 - uh which actually got accepted and it's
02:29 - live now
02:32 - so it's just a basic skill called weird
02:34 - and weird in fact it's w-e-i-r-t-o-n
02:38 - we're 10 facts and weirdtoon is my
02:40 - hometown so it just gives you some you
02:43 - know random facts about my hometown so
02:45 - that was kind of my first
02:47 - first alexa skill kept it really simple
02:50 - and then in my other workshop that's
02:52 - where i got a lot of the ideas that i'm
02:53 - going to share with you
02:55 - today
02:57 - so
02:59 - shout out to
03:02 - francisca i don't remember her last name
03:05 - no
03:06 - um
03:08 - you know what i i gave her a shout out
03:10 - in the tweet my latest tweet so check it
03:12 - out if you want to see her name but she
03:13 - works for google and she gave an awesome
03:15 - workshop on a lot of google cloud stuff
03:18 - and
03:19 - we built a little
03:21 - a little node app
03:23 - on google cloud so
03:27 - you can
03:28 - check out that tweet if you want to know
03:30 - more about her
03:32 - and
03:34 - i think we're going to get started so
03:36 - the way i'm going to do this i'm going
03:37 - to set a pomodoro timer during that time
03:40 - we're just going to talk about and
03:41 - discuss things related to deployment if
03:43 - you have any other questions like
03:45 - general coding questions or really
03:46 - anything in general you want to know my
03:48 - favorite color go ahead and ask it but
03:50 - i'm going to save those questions for
03:52 - our five-minute breaks and then i'll
03:54 - save it for the very end of the stream
03:55 - once we get through all the deployment
03:57 - stuff
03:58 - and then that way that'll help us stay
04:00 - focused a little bit but
04:02 - you shouldn't have to wait too long to
04:03 - get your question
04:04 - answered
04:07 - oh awesome
04:09 - um
04:11 - francisca is is here i hope i'm
04:14 - pronouncing your first name right let me
04:15 - know if i'm not i i really would like to
04:18 - pronounce it right
04:19 - and uh great so if i mess anything up in
04:22 - terms of google cloud stuff i hopefully
04:25 - uh you know you'll be able to correct me
04:28 - there so let me start this pomodoro
04:30 - session
04:31 - if you're not familiar with pomodoro
04:32 - session it's
04:33 - it can vary a bit but it's usually 25
04:35 - minutes with a five minute break
04:40 - all right so i'm just gonna do this in
04:41 - markdown i thought about opening up uh
04:44 - google doc or something to kind of mark
04:46 - down my my plans or write up the plans
04:49 - but i thought hey like we do coding why
04:50 - not do it in vs code and markdown
04:53 - uh
04:54 - so um it'll look prettier on the right
04:58 - hand side so if you follow along you can
05:00 - check that out
05:02 - and
05:04 - here's i'm gonna go down through and
05:07 - just give you my
05:10 - my vision for how this is going to
05:11 - deploy so let's take that react part
05:14 - first so we have our react project
05:16 - which is
05:18 - you know node we have express running uh
05:21 - we we built that out with next js
05:24 - um we're using apollo for graphql so if
05:27 - you all seen any of the streams you know
05:29 - you know how that is we've already
05:30 - successfully deployed it
05:32 - using now
05:34 - which is from the same company that
05:36 - makes js it's zeit
05:39 - so
05:39 - that's a really easy deployment it
05:42 - scales it's fast
05:44 - i want to use that because then that
05:45 - takes away the burden of server
05:47 - maintenance
05:49 - i love the fact that it
05:50 - scales so it should be able to handle
05:53 - whatever traffic and updating things is
05:56 - super easy there's no downtime
05:58 - so that's the the strategy now so
06:02 - let's go and do
06:05 - a small heading
06:07 - for all these subplants so let's just
06:08 - call this the
06:11 - the react app we'll do a small heading
06:14 - and then we're just going to do a list
06:15 - we're going to say now
06:19 - is is going to be our deployment so that
06:20 - one's pretty simple
06:22 - uh i think that one is is not really
06:24 - going to be where the debate's at
06:25 - although
06:29 - uh nikki says is your mic pointed at
06:31 - your pc
06:33 - okay you know what my mic did fall down
06:35 - a bit it came loose so i didn't notice
06:38 - it until you just said that
06:39 - let me
06:40 - there we go i hope that's better
06:44 - i'm gonna move it a bit closer to me as
06:46 - well and away from my my computer all
06:49 - right cool so that should be better
06:50 - sorry about that
06:52 - um
06:53 - i'm going to do my best to keep my eye
06:55 - on the live chat to see if there's
06:57 - anything related to our deployment
07:02 - all right so now the next part we're
07:04 - gonna do
07:05 - uh so let's do react the next part is
07:07 - gonna be our
07:10 - our database so
07:14 - my
07:17 - so we have a mysql database and i'll go
07:19 - in and fill out the rest here
07:31 - files
07:42 - okay so this is a good layout for kind
07:44 - of the structure of what we'll need so
07:47 - for our mysql database right now
07:51 - it's linked up on a digital ocean
07:53 - droplet so we have one droplet it's just
07:55 - a cheap five dollar droplet and it has
07:58 - our wordpress installation
08:00 - any files associated with that
08:03 - and then it also has the mysql database
08:06 - all right there
08:08 - so
08:10 - i don't want to keep it like that the
08:12 - reason being uh well obviously a five
08:14 - dollar droplet is not going to do it
08:16 - we'd have to increase the size of the
08:18 - droplets significantly but then that
08:20 - also provides us with a single point of
08:23 - failure
08:24 - we could stay in digital ocean and one
08:27 - option that i have thought of and this
08:28 - could probably be our backup
08:30 - is
08:32 - to use
08:33 - multiple droplets
08:35 - so we would have multiple instances
08:39 - of my sequel
08:41 - and wordpress
08:43 - and load balance between them and then
08:45 - somehow make sure they're all in sync at
08:48 - all times
08:50 - to me that's a lot of work for some and
08:53 - it's something that i've never attempted
08:54 - before so that's why i say
08:57 - probably better for a backup
08:59 - um
09:01 - oh no
09:03 - i'm not showing my screen
09:07 - i'm sorry anyway
09:10 - here's what i've been typing
09:13 - so sorry i'm just i'm really excited
09:15 - about this so i i'm forgetting little
09:18 - things
09:19 - okay so here's where we're at so for our
09:21 - react app we're gonna use now as our
09:24 - primary and uh we'll we'll also come up
09:27 - with some a backup for that as well
09:29 - so
09:31 - there we are thank you for saying
09:33 - something who said steven said i can't
09:35 - see the layout uh who can't see okay so
09:38 - it looks like a lot of you said you
09:40 - can't see the layout oh so sorry
09:43 - um it's been a while since i've done
09:45 - that one
09:46 - uh
09:47 - forgotten to show the screen but it
09:49 - happens you think after a year doing
09:51 - live streams over a year now i would
09:53 - remember that but
09:55 - still don't
09:56 - okay so
09:58 - to solve the complexity issues of having
10:01 - multiple databases and trying to keep
10:03 - them in sync i thought why not go with
10:06 - one of these cloud hosted database
10:09 - services so there are several
10:11 - options out there
10:14 - because i did a workshop with google
10:17 - cloud
10:18 - i think it would be easier for me and
10:20 - i'd be a little bit more comfortable if
10:22 - i went with google's uh cloud sql
10:25 - uh stuff so let me show you what i'm
10:27 - talking about and i'll paste the link in
10:29 - for you
10:31 - because i have this up
10:34 - at least i did have it up
10:38 - where is it at
10:40 - i hope i didn't close it out oh no here
10:42 - it is
10:44 - uh let me go back i'm actually in the
10:47 - console to start setting it up so i want
10:49 - to back up and go to just kind of like
10:51 - the sales page and info page for it
10:54 - so
10:56 - here's what what i'm talking about when
10:59 - i'm talking about the cloud sql okay so
11:01 - it's a part of google cloud
11:04 - and
11:05 - i'm going to paste this into the chat
11:07 - the live chat so you all can check it
11:09 - out if you want
11:15 - and
11:16 - if if you click on that and it doesn't
11:18 - take you the right place please try
11:19 - copying and pasting it
11:21 - there's often some issues with the links
11:23 - if you paste them into the live chat
11:26 - so
11:27 - this would definitely work we're
11:28 - obviously going to go with the my sequel
11:31 - option
11:33 - but here's what i a few of the parts
11:35 - that really stood out to me as to why i
11:36 - want to do with with this
11:39 - um
11:40 - fully managed right
11:43 - so
11:43 - automatic backups
11:45 - right that's that's awesome
11:47 - automatic updates
11:49 - right those are two big things that we
11:52 - need to have that i won't have to worry
11:54 - about anymore and uh you all that have
11:57 - been watching for a while you know that
11:58 - it
11:59 - i get pulled off projects and onto other
12:01 - projects and have deadlines so
12:04 - it's very easy for me to forget
12:06 - stuff like that
12:08 - that really nobody else is gonna nobody
12:10 - hire up and is gonna say like make sure
12:12 - you do those updates they're not even
12:14 - gonna realize we need updates or we need
12:17 - backups or anything the only time
12:18 - anybody is gonna be worried about that
12:20 - is if something wrong happens and then
12:22 - they'll say well didn't we have any
12:23 - backups
12:25 - so having that taken care of is going to
12:27 - just
12:28 - free up so much time and worry from me
12:31 - so that alone i think makes it worth it
12:34 - but also
12:35 - the performance like i doubt i'm going
12:37 - to be able to match that performance
12:39 - if i just stick with setting up my own
12:42 - droplets
12:44 - same way with reliability i love this so
12:47 - digitalocean
12:50 - as far as i know i haven't researched
12:52 - myself but a colleague of mine here has
12:55 - researched the security certificates on
12:57 - digitalocean and they
13:00 - are okay but they definitely don't
13:02 - rise to this level of security so i mean
13:06 - look we we're not going to do anything
13:07 - hipaa related but if we wanted to we'd
13:09 - even be good for hipaa if you're not
13:11 - familiar with that here in the united
13:12 - states at least uh if you're doing
13:15 - anything with people's medical data you
13:17 - need to be hipaa compliant so it's it's
13:19 - kind of a pretty high level of
13:22 - security that's required so basically we
13:24 - have all these certificates and more if
13:27 - you dig into the documentation there's
13:28 - even more certificates that i can
13:30 - present to auditors when they come in
13:32 - or let's say like the head of the it
13:34 - department here and say
13:37 - you know if there's ever any question
13:38 - about well how we set this up i can say
13:41 - listen
13:42 - all of the data we have for this site
13:45 - is in a secure place you know it's
13:48 - these certificates are provided so
13:50 - that's it's not always a big deal
13:52 - depending on who your client is or what
13:54 - you're working on but here in this
13:55 - setting we do go through uh
13:58 - data security audits and things so it's
14:00 - it's definitely important for me to have
14:02 - that
14:03 - okay so
14:06 - that's just a little overview
14:08 - i'm going to check the live chat see if
14:10 - there's any questions
14:18 - all right i don't see anything yet which
14:20 - i mean which is okay i guess it's good
14:22 - so i guess that means what i've been
14:23 - saying so far makes sense
14:25 - so
14:26 - we're gonna we're gonna go over here and
14:28 - i'm going to say
14:30 - google cloud
14:32 - sql will be our option one
14:36 - whoops click in the wrong place
14:46 - okay so that's going to be our option
14:48 - and i want you all to think of some
14:49 - backups because i told you a backup that
14:51 - i thought of doing but realistically i
14:55 - i don't want to have to do that with
14:57 - with the short amount of time we have
14:58 - until launch i'm not confident
15:01 - that i can get that working
15:03 - reliably
15:05 - in that amount of time
15:07 - um okay
15:09 - now we also have wordpress right so for
15:12 - wordpress it's currently on that same
15:14 - digital ocean droplet that we talked
15:15 - about a few minutes ago
15:19 - um
15:21 - okay we did just so phoenix just said
15:23 - you tweeted that you want to discuss
15:25 - something from revconf here yeah so
15:27 - the ideas that i'm getting for the cloud
15:30 - sql database and then also down here for
15:32 - the files and images which we haven't
15:34 - gone over yet i got those ideas from
15:37 - um
15:38 - francisca's
15:40 - workshop
15:41 - at revconf so that's what i want to talk
15:43 - to you mainly about if anybody has any
15:45 - other questions about refcoff let me
15:47 - know we can get to those later i'm
15:48 - thinking about maybe doing a recap video
15:50 - from revconf and putting it on my
15:52 - youtube channel links in the description
15:55 - so
15:56 - i'd love to do that as soon as i can
15:59 - realistically though uh i will be very
16:01 - busy until the site launches so i can't
16:03 - promise you that that will come out soon
16:06 - but i'd like to i'd like to at least
16:08 - make the video while it's still fresh in
16:10 - my mind
16:11 - uh
16:12 - okay so for the wordpress here's what
16:14 - i'm thinking alright i've never done
16:16 - this before
16:18 - but
16:19 - as far as i know it is possible
16:23 - to host
16:25 - wordpress
16:26 - with now
16:28 - so if you're not familiar with now
16:33 - essentially
16:39 - all right from from my perspective from
16:40 - a user's perspective with now
16:44 - a user being like the developer right
16:46 - who's using now as a service
16:48 - you type in a command on the command
16:50 - line and your site is launched
16:52 - that's it
16:54 - it's that easy if you want your site to
16:56 - use a custom url which we will it's just
16:58 - another command
17:00 - super easy deployments right so that's
17:03 - the benefit of now and then
17:05 - you don't have to worry about the server
17:08 - uh managing a server or anything like
17:09 - that it takes care of scaling all that
17:12 - so
17:14 - we're already using this successfully
17:16 - for a react app
17:19 - but for wordpress what we need though is
17:21 - to decouple from wordpress
17:24 - not only the database
17:26 - but also the files
17:28 - okay so to be honest with you i'm not a
17:31 - hundred percent certain that we have to
17:32 - decouple the files but i assume that you
17:35 - would have to
17:36 - uh and i want to i've wanted to anyway
17:40 - um
17:42 - so
17:44 - our my first idea here to go with this
17:47 - is plan a is going to be used now
17:52 - and i'm just going to say uh
17:54 - backup
17:55 - our backup plan is going to be
18:00 - digitalocean
18:03 - and if you all come up with any better
18:05 - backup plans please let me know but
18:07 - we can still
18:10 - take out the files the database and
18:12 - everything and go with digitalocean
18:15 - and uh just do load balancing on
18:18 - digitalocean they set up so you can do
18:20 - automatic load balancing
18:22 - we did that for way back for project one
18:24 - last year and that that worked we didn't
18:27 - use it with wordpress we used it with
18:28 - react but it did work so at least we
18:30 - know how to set up the load balancing
18:32 - there
18:33 - so i think this is a decent backup
18:36 - but not ideal due to some of the things
18:38 - that
18:40 - um that i mentioned earlier okay so that
18:44 - leaves our our final
18:46 - our final thing here are the files so
18:48 - there's two big reasons why i think we
18:51 - should host the files somewhere other
18:53 - than you know on a droplet uh tightly
18:56 - coupled there to our wordpress install
18:59 - number one
19:00 - we need to migrate a ton of files from
19:04 - the old system
19:06 - which is based on ektron
19:08 - and is currently hosted on campus here
19:11 - just a few buildings away
19:14 - so i need to be able to store those
19:17 - somewhere else
19:19 - and keep the file structure
19:23 - it's i could do that on digital ocean i
19:26 - would have to get extra storage for the
19:28 - droplet though
19:29 - um and then
19:31 - again there's the the whole management
19:34 - of it right i still have to manage that
19:36 - number two
19:38 - is when i want a user when a user is
19:40 - going to upload a file to wordpress
19:43 - right so whether that be me
19:45 - or somebody else
19:47 - in my department or even users from
19:49 - other departments that we're going to
19:51 - train over the course of this next year
19:53 - after this launches we're going to train
19:54 - go department by department do training
19:57 - give them their own wordpress accounts
19:59 - limited access so they can update their
20:01 - own content
20:02 - they're going to want to upload
20:04 - documents
20:05 - and images
20:08 - i don't want those to just go on the
20:09 - droplet
20:10 - you know let's say
20:12 - it gets out of hand people start
20:14 - uploading a ton of really big things
20:16 - it could take up the space on a droplet
20:18 - quickly i don't want to go overkill and
20:20 - pay for a ton of space but i also don't
20:22 - want to
20:23 - get taken off guard
20:25 - and
20:26 - fill up all the space in my droplet so
20:29 - something like
20:31 - google's cloud storage buckets
20:34 - i think would work better
20:36 - it would give us more flexibility in
20:38 - terms of storage and it would have
20:41 - availability so let me show you what i'm
20:43 - thinking
20:44 - with google's
20:46 - cloud storage so
20:49 - again i
20:50 - have the documentation open and not like
20:52 - the sales page so let me go back to
20:56 - the sales page here
20:58 - the sales page has like the main points
21:00 - that you want and the nice looking
21:02 - graphics so that's why i'm going with
21:04 - that
21:04 - um
21:05 - products let's see
21:08 - storage
21:10 - cloud storage
21:16 - i think i'm still partially in the
21:18 - documentation part of it
21:26 - these cases features good features
21:33 - no
21:34 - [Music]
21:36 - all right i was kind of hoping for
21:38 - [Music]
21:39 - a different page
21:41 - let me see
21:45 - oh well i'll just go back to the page i
21:47 - was on i i think it's fresh enough in my
21:49 - mind that i can explain this a little
21:51 - bit more
21:52 - without it
21:54 - and i did actually have a storage bucket
21:57 - that i created from the
21:59 - uh
22:00 - from the conference from the workshop
22:02 - that we could go to if i need to get
22:03 - into it a little more i don't really
22:05 - want to get into technical stuff but
22:07 - just say like
22:08 - um
22:10 - essentially you could see
22:12 - the prices
22:14 - think of like
22:15 - think of dropbox or google drive or
22:19 - microsoft onedrive right think of that
22:23 - but being able
22:24 - to drop all your files in there and have
22:27 - them available for consumption
22:29 - at a url for websites
22:34 - that's that's kind of like what we have
22:36 - here and
22:37 - we're paying
22:39 - a price per gigabyte per month
22:42 - okay which i love that so that means
22:45 - we pay for what we have in there
22:48 - if we put more in there we pay more but
22:50 - we're not we don't have like this fixed
22:52 - limit which is what i was afraid of i
22:55 - don't want to overpay and i also don't
22:57 - want to get stuck so this will allow us
22:59 - to scale nicely
23:01 - uh i can come in on a regular basis and
23:04 - clean things up if i need to and say
23:06 - like yeah we don't need five of these
23:08 - images or so and so uploaded like this
23:12 - gigantic 5k video or something crazy
23:15 - uh and we definitely don't need that
23:19 - uh so
23:21 - i i love that
23:24 - and i love the fact that i don't have to
23:27 - worry about
23:29 - like backups
23:31 - i don't have to worry about
23:33 - um
23:34 - like providing for that on my on my own
23:37 - like maintenance
23:38 - to that server
23:40 - it's it's taken care of
23:42 - so this is
23:44 - since i work with this already at
23:47 - revconf i feel more confident working
23:49 - with google's product
23:51 - i know amazon offers similar uh product
23:55 - i assume microsoft does i'm not 100 sure
23:58 - though
23:59 - but i think given the timeline i could
24:01 - probably set this up more quickly
24:04 - than i could
24:06 - otherwise my department already has a
24:08 - google account set up
24:10 - with billing attached so i just need to
24:12 - make sure and talk to some people who
24:13 - understand how the billing process works
24:16 - here i try to keep myself out of that
24:18 - because it's just a lot of extra
24:19 - paperwork so i got to talk to my
24:21 - colleague and make sure that
24:24 - uh
24:25 - we don't get in trouble first for
24:27 - setting up this account but i'd like to
24:29 - set that up soon and i'd like to do that
24:31 - on the live stream coming up soon
24:34 - uh so i'm just going to go with
24:37 - on here i'm going to say google cloud
24:39 - storage
24:44 - okay so
24:46 - these are mostly just
24:48 - like the plans plan a right we still
24:51 - need our plan b's our backup plans
24:54 - so that's kind of what i want to discuss
24:56 - whether or not number one whether or not
24:58 - these plan plan a's are any good
25:02 - or if there's something i'm missing and
25:04 - then number two
25:06 - what should plan b b
25:08 - especially if any of you have used any
25:09 - of this stuff for something similar on a
25:11 - real project i definitely want your uh
25:14 - your input
25:16 - i'm gonna check my timer too so we got
25:18 - about five minutes and then i'll get to
25:19 - some of the questions that are unrelated
25:22 - uh let me scroll up a bit make sure i
25:24 - haven't
25:25 - missed anything
25:30 - let's see
25:40 - six
25:47 - all right so so far i haven't had any
25:50 - comments on this um
25:53 - outline okay so
25:55 - uh arunesh says aws s3 should be good s3
25:59 - is the storage stuff right
26:02 - you know how aws is and you don't you
26:04 - don't know what anything means
26:06 - if somebody already hasn't made a
26:08 - browser plug-in that translate aws's
26:11 - names into something more reasonable
26:14 - then you should somebody should make it
26:16 - maybe i'll try to make it but
26:19 - i did work with some aws stuff as well
26:22 - when i did that alexa skill workshop
26:25 - um
26:27 - realistically though i think if if i'm
26:29 - gonna use google cloud sql and google
26:32 - cloud storage that's fine if i'm gonna
26:34 - switch and do something with amazon with
26:36 - aws i'd rather do aws for both
26:40 - because that's just one less account
26:41 - that i have to worry about managing
26:46 - so i'm open to it i just want to know
26:50 - what are the differences between going
26:51 - with aws and that that's amazon web
26:54 - services if you're not familiar with the
26:56 - uh with the name
26:58 - so
26:59 - going with amazon versus going with
27:01 - google
27:03 - what are the
27:04 - differences uh is there any
27:08 - good reason to go with one or the other
27:13 - let's see okay nikki says
27:15 - uh
27:16 - nikki doesn't have experience
27:19 - but heard uh westboss uh and scott
27:23 - tolinski talk about cloudanry for image
27:26 - storage on the syntax podcast
27:29 - uh nikki also says that's a great
27:31 - podcast you know what i haven't listened
27:32 - to that one yet i'll have to add that
27:34 - to my podcast actually i do want to give
27:37 - a shout out to um
27:39 - the
27:40 - tales from the script podcast uh so the
27:43 - guy who does that podcast i got to meet
27:46 - him and hang out with him at revconf and
27:49 - super nice guy
27:50 - so check that out also there's a podcast
27:52 - called
27:54 - dark net diaries if you're interested in
27:56 - like hackers and things like that
27:59 - in security check out darknet diaries
28:01 - podcast i binge listened to that on the
28:04 - way back from revconf and i listened to
28:06 - every episode
28:07 - it was that good
28:09 - so definitely check that out
28:13 - okay arnesh says
28:15 - aws s3 which is their storage
28:18 - has a good backup strategy okay all
28:20 - right that's cool definitely need to
28:22 - look into that
28:24 - steven says westboss likes cloudnary a
28:28 - lot i wonder
28:31 - now i'm just saying i i have no proof of
28:33 - this but
28:34 - if they mention cloudnary a lot on their
28:37 - podcast are they getting referral credit
28:39 - or something for cloudnery
28:42 - um
28:43 - that doesn't mean culinary's not good it
28:46 - just makes me wonder
28:56 - okay back we got another suggestion
28:58 - called backblaze
29:00 - arnesh says aws s3 is the cheapest
29:06 - oh nikki says yes they are they are
29:08 - sponsored and are upfront about it okay
29:18 - okay let me uh mark down some of these
29:21 - suggestions for our storage here so
29:24 - we're going to add
29:27 - as potential options
29:34 - aws s3 we're also going to add
29:37 - cloudinary
29:40 - and then the last one that was mentioned
29:42 - i've never heard of before uh back
29:45 - blaze
29:48 - back blaze okay so
29:51 - these are gonna be our options that we
29:54 - need to look into
29:56 - i don't have a ton of time to spend on
29:58 - researching this so i'm just going to
30:00 - look into them a little bit more so if
30:02 - you all have some reasons why you would
30:04 - recommend one over all the others let me
30:07 - know that would be very helpful
30:11 - let's see
30:17 - oh let me
30:18 - i'm going to do the five minute break
30:19 - right now so
30:21 - during this five minute break i'm going
30:22 - to answer any questions that are
30:24 - unrelated to our current topic after
30:26 - that we're going to reset the timer
30:28 - we're going to get back to the
30:29 - discussion make sure we have
30:31 - backup plans for each one of the things
30:33 - the pieces that need to deploy
30:38 - all right so we have a lot of people
30:39 - saying hi i'm not gonna go through
30:40 - everybody but if you did say hi i'm
30:42 - saying hi back to you right now i do see
30:44 - all the hellos
30:48 - let's see
30:52 - oh nikki uh said uh just published uh
30:55 - part two of uh fresh dev environment
30:59 - blog post so cool everybody check that
31:01 - out if you
31:02 - can michael says you remember when your
31:05 - boss used to go away to team building
31:08 - conference i've got a feeling this is
31:10 - going to be like that
31:22 - who some asked if i would make an
31:23 - algorithm course uh i could i tell you
31:26 - truth i might not be the best person to
31:28 - make an algorithm course
31:31 - i mean i've i've done them
31:33 - successfully but
31:35 - uh i that wouldn't be top on my list of
31:37 - things i would feel confident that i
31:40 - could contribute something but i'm open
31:42 - to it i'll uh definitely add that to the
31:44 - list of potential
31:46 - video tutorials and things that i could
31:48 - make
32:01 - let's see
32:17 - uh okay michael's uh
32:20 - michael who's with us frequently on the
32:21 - live stream is having trouble with his
32:23 - internet which that's that really stinks
32:26 - sorry about if you're still with us
32:28 - sorry about that michael if you if you
32:30 - can't watch it now but you can watch it
32:32 - later on uh you know definitely just put
32:35 - your input into the comments or dm me or
32:37 - something and uh i i would still
32:40 - appreciate you your opinion on these
32:42 - things
32:54 - okay uh rick adams says which book and
32:57 - or video titles
32:59 - uh
33:01 - are
33:02 - recommended for a thorough base of
33:05 - software development regarding object
33:07 - oriented programming
33:09 - sql or sql depending how you like to say
33:12 - it
33:13 - um
33:14 - rbdb
33:15 - design and scripting in java
33:18 - oh i don't i don't really know
33:21 - uh
33:22 - you know because i don't deal with
33:25 - like java
33:26 - at all
33:29 - and i minimally deal with sql
33:32 - and realistically like
33:34 - you know uh with react
33:36 - we're not really doing object-oriented
33:38 - programming
33:40 - so
33:44 - i don't really know does anyone else
33:45 - have any
33:47 - suggestions for books or videos
33:49 - on those topics if you do please let us
33:51 - know in the live chat or if you're
33:53 - watching later on please throw it in the
33:55 - comments to the video
34:08 - phoenix said i once listened to that
34:10 - meaning the dark net diaries podcast and
34:13 - never again since i started having
34:15 - thoughts about the dark about darknet
34:17 - bad thoughts
34:20 - yeah well if you've ever been tempted to
34:22 - be uh you know a bad hacker then um
34:25 - maybe that's not the show for you it'd
34:27 - be too tempting
34:35 - uh lawson arts3 asks what's the question
34:39 - uh basically our question now is
34:43 - what are the best ways to handle these
34:45 - different pieces of the deployment that
34:47 - we need to do
34:48 - for our current project that's project
34:50 - five in this video series
34:53 - um so
34:56 - in particular if you have any opinion
34:58 - about any of these products for file
35:00 - storage you know please let let me know
35:08 - francisco says as far as i know on
35:10 - standard products like stores the large
35:12 - providers are all equally good and
35:13 - similarly priced it's probably simpler
35:16 - if you have one provider for all your
35:18 - services
35:19 - okay cool yeah i definitely agree on
35:20 - having one provider
35:22 - for all the services so
35:25 - uh and thank you for that
35:29 - let's see
35:32 - okay so
35:33 - cloud storage uh azure is expensive
35:38 - okay so azure is
35:40 - maybe we didn't even have that as an
35:42 - option so i'm not going to add it in
35:43 - right now nobody really suggested it
35:46 - but that would be microsoft's version of
35:49 - this
35:51 - joshua asked why i'm using wordpress for
35:53 - the front end we're not using wordpress
35:55 - for the front end react is the front end
35:57 - wordpress is just handling our content
35:58 - management i needed something that
36:01 - uh
36:02 - was very user friendly for the people
36:04 - that are gonna have to edit this because
36:05 - we're going to have a lot of people that
36:07 - have no coding experience
36:09 - editing this
36:10 - uh so wordpress
36:13 - does provide that i think a pretty
36:16 - pretty simple user experience and it
36:18 - also has a huge
36:19 - uh community of developers
36:22 - you know that i can reach out to if i
36:25 - need help to customize some things
36:27 - i do have somewhat of a background in
36:29 - wordpress as well when i freelanced i
36:31 - used to do a lot of wordpress sites
36:32 - because it seems like every small
36:34 - business has a wordpress site
36:37 - all right
36:39 - let's go back and we'll do one more
36:41 - pomodoro session we may not even take
36:43 - the whole session and then i'll go back
36:45 - and make sure i've answered all the
36:46 - questions here
36:49 - uh but i want to to go back and fill
36:52 - this list out a little bit more
36:55 - so keep it coming with all the ideas
36:57 - definitely appreciate it i've already
36:59 - had a few ideas that i never thought of
37:01 - because i've never heard of these
37:02 - services
37:13 - let's see
37:24 - let's see
37:36 - all right uh lawson says all i know
37:38 - about them is aws seems
37:41 - aws is the most solid choice not
37:43 - considering price or firebase is from
37:46 - what i've seen
37:48 - okay yeah so firebase being a google
37:51 - product i don't think we'll need
37:54 - firebase though uh
37:57 - i mean we're because we definitely
37:58 - already have the data in a sql database
38:01 - so i would don't
38:03 - i don't want to convert you know i don't
38:05 - want to switch it over but
38:07 - um so that's why i'd rather go with a
38:09 - you know cloud sql
38:12 - amazon does have something similar as
38:14 - well so we could go with that
38:26 - okay harsh it's here hey how's it going
38:27 - harsh it
38:29 - uh as you can see on the screen these
38:31 - are
38:32 - uh some of the options that we're going
38:34 - with for deployment for each part
38:37 - of our
38:38 - of our project so if you have any
38:40 - opinion on any of these please
38:42 - let me know
38:47 - okay so
38:49 - keep the suggestions coming i think i've
38:51 - gotten through all of them
38:53 - i want to talk a little bit about backup
38:55 - plans for some of these
38:57 - so
38:59 - for our react app
39:02 - we may be able to go with
39:06 - if we can't go with now
39:08 - for whatever reason
39:10 - i'm i'm not going to speculate on why
39:12 - let's let's just say it we can't go with
39:14 - now
39:15 - our backup of course could be
39:21 - load balanced
39:29 - digital ocean droplets okay why digital
39:31 - ocean well we already have an account
39:33 - with digitalocean so that would be
39:36 - faster but realistically
39:38 - could we do something with a different
39:39 - provider yeah we definitely could um
39:43 - you know
39:44 - amazon google microsoft
39:47 - or any other number of providers we
39:49 - could probably do the same thing for i
39:51 - like that digitalocean has a really easy
39:54 - load balancing built in i don't have
39:56 - enough experience with other options to
39:58 - know if their load balancing is
40:00 - as easy
40:02 - okay but
40:03 - this takes a little bit more work
40:05 - we would have to keep up with the
40:07 - updates and maintenance on all these
40:08 - servers so that's why that's definitely
40:10 - a backup plan
40:14 - if anybody has any other options for
40:16 - backup plans that may be better than
40:18 - that please let me know
40:20 - it says
40:21 - let's see
40:36 - okay bo bo's here i didn't see uh so bo
40:39 - karns who does uh a ton of stuff for the
40:42 - free code camp youtube channel is here
40:44 - uh so good to have you here
40:52 - and we have some more
40:54 - uh
40:55 - opinions on what we should do here so
40:58 - um
41:00 - quinny's says digitalocean has spaces
41:03 - with backups as data storage as well
41:05 - doesn't it
41:06 - you know what i believe they do so i i
41:08 - do believe digitalocean has
41:10 - the data storage uh backups and things
41:13 - too
41:14 - so maybe you know what maybe we should
41:16 - add digitalocean here as well as an
41:19 - option makes sense we already have an
41:21 - account with them
41:24 - and i believe
41:26 - someone else in my department has used
41:28 - the storage in digitalocean so i'll be
41:30 - able to talk to them and see
41:33 - what they thought of it
41:43 - uh
41:44 - bovin says are you looking uh also
41:48 - looking for network latency problem many
41:50 - times we experience in some regions of
41:52 - the world
41:53 - websites load very slow due to network
41:56 - latency
41:57 - uh well yeah
41:59 - i'm
42:00 - i definitely want to avoid latency as
42:02 - much as possible uh i'm not sure
42:06 - other than trying to make my site as
42:08 - small and fast as possible i'm not sure
42:11 - what else i could do
42:13 - in in terms of helping with network
42:15 - latency
42:20 - matt duchess says perfect timing for
42:22 - this topic working on mine thanks
42:24 - you're welcome i'm i'm glad hopefully
42:26 - this will be helpful to you
42:28 - oh okay stephen has a in a very reliable
42:32 - kind of old school
42:34 - uh
42:36 - method here
42:37 - steven says how about a couple of thumb
42:39 - drives and dvd-r
42:42 - archives yeah we could add that in the
42:45 - mix right
42:46 - you know
42:48 - it'll def it'll be totally offline we
42:50 - don't have to worry about hackers
42:51 - getting in stealing or corrupting our
42:53 - data right
42:59 - that would be actually hilarious just to
43:01 - have like a little piece of artwork
43:02 - hanging in my office that are like
43:05 - the entire website and thumb drives or
43:07 - something like that
43:10 - maybe i'll have it in glass that says
43:12 - break in case of emergency
43:15 - just
43:22 - harshit says by the way you will be
43:23 - working using docker for wordpress now
43:26 - yes
43:27 - so that's
43:28 - let me
43:31 - let me just show you a little bit of the
43:33 - details about how this would would need
43:35 - to work
43:37 - so
43:37 - i've already forked the example
43:41 - um for how to use wordpress with now
43:45 - so if you check out this fus marcom here
43:48 - i'll give you a link to it uh so our
43:50 - organization that we've been building
43:51 - our all our stuff and now has a fork of
43:54 - this so that we can modify it if we need
43:56 - to
43:57 - but basically yes we
44:00 - we have a docker file and that's where
44:04 - uh things things run so if you see
44:08 - like this is where we get
44:10 - all the wordpress stuff right and they
44:12 - actually have send grid built in if we
44:14 - need to do
44:15 - emails
44:17 - we aren't we aren't going to need the
44:18 - send grid part of this
44:20 - or at least we aren't going to use it
44:22 - i'm not sure yet if we need it
44:25 - uh so that wordpress will still work
44:29 - there are some parts of wordpress that
44:31 - auto send emails you know to
44:34 - like people when they sign in as users
44:36 - or uh to whoever the admin is which
44:38 - would probably be me
44:41 - whenever new users users sign in so we
44:44 - may need the email just for that sort of
44:46 - thing
44:48 - so might keep it but essentially you
44:51 - know for those of you who know docker
44:52 - this will make more sense to you
44:54 - uh but
44:56 - these are all the instructions to get
44:57 - wordpress up and running within that
44:59 - docker container
45:01 - um
45:03 - so i need to spend more time kind of
45:05 - studying this to figure out because
45:07 - there are a few things in use here that
45:09 - i've never used before so harshit
45:11 - mentions uh hhvm i've never even heard
45:14 - of that before much less used it so
45:16 - that's one of the things i want to
45:18 - research more about
45:23 - harshad says it will be two times faster
45:25 - than php5
45:27 - hey well i like that
45:29 - [Music]
45:30 - anything to make it faster is good so
45:35 - so if anybody knows a little bit more
45:37 - about docker and can kind of see what's
45:38 - going on or you want to use the link to
45:41 - um
45:42 - you know to check it out inspect it a
45:44 - little bit more depth you know if you
45:46 - have some some input for me that would
45:48 - be great
45:52 - but this is the official example if you
45:54 - go to the now documentation and you look
45:57 - up
45:58 - wordpress this is where they point you
46:01 - uh so
46:03 - it's um
46:05 - it's at least trusted by the now team to
46:08 - use with wordpress
46:11 - uh so i'm kind of basing my confidence
46:13 - on on that
46:22 - uh michael creel has a good point
46:25 - says not sure how wordpress works when
46:27 - you finally hand it off you're going to
46:28 - need
46:29 - a lot of validation rules
46:32 - uh if they're going to be less
46:33 - experienced people working on it i
46:35 - paraphrased a bit but um
46:38 - yeah
46:39 - yes you're right uh we're def that's why
46:42 - we're holding off
46:44 - on
46:44 - giving other people access right now and
46:46 - we're gonna slowly roll it out and train
46:49 - people over the next year
46:51 - one of the
46:52 - one of the big reasons other than just
46:54 - the time it takes for training is
46:56 - making sure
46:58 - that we set it up in a way that users
47:00 - have as much freedom as possible
47:03 - without really the ability to mess
47:05 - things up
47:07 - too much
47:08 - so
47:09 - we're definitely going to be
47:10 - working on that
47:22 - okay
47:24 - let me go back here
47:27 - and say so basically
47:29 - we have
47:32 - our plans and then backups for
47:34 - everything except this um google cloud
47:37 - sql
47:38 - um and i'm gonna put here as a slash
47:42 - slash aws because you know as we
47:44 - mentioned earlier
47:47 - you know if we decide to go with google
47:49 - here we're gonna go with google you know
47:51 - down here as well
47:53 - if we decide to go with aws it's going
47:56 - to be aws you know pretty much across
47:58 - the board
48:02 - but as a backup let me know what you
48:04 - think about
48:05 - you know essentially
48:07 - doing
48:12 - something like this right
48:17 - load balance situation droplets
48:20 - and
48:22 - actually i let me change this to say
48:24 - load balance situation droplets here
48:27 - okay now
48:28 - if you're not familiar with with how
48:29 - we've done this in the past
48:32 - essentially what you do is have droplets
48:34 - that are exactly the same
48:36 - so let's we run a few droplets that are
48:38 - exactly the same and then we would use
48:40 - digital oceans load balancing service
48:42 - which is an extra 20 a month
48:45 - and then
48:46 - they would handle a lot of the technical
48:48 - details of it we would just have control
48:51 - over a few settings
48:53 - and then they would you know they the
48:54 - load balancing would be handled so for
48:56 - each time we do this for the react app
48:59 - that adds an extra 20
49:01 - for the database extra 20 for wordpress
49:03 - and extra 20.
49:05 - uh so that's an extra 60 a month
49:08 - that
49:09 - potentially we wouldn't really need
49:12 - uh just for the load balancing and then
49:13 - on top of that we need the droplets
49:16 - so we'd have to pay for each one of the
49:18 - droplets so
49:20 - i believe that using now
49:23 - and some sort of cloud service here
49:25 - would end up being
49:28 - easier to manage and also less expensive
49:33 - uh also easier to scale
49:39 - let's see
49:42 - we have a few more opinions on this as
49:44 - well so let's see
49:46 - uh harshit says aws rds is also
49:52 - good easy to set up
49:54 - uh use docker for my sequel with volume
49:57 - but i guess that would be overkill
50:00 - francisca says i have to run thanks for
50:02 - the stream watch we'll catch the rest
50:03 - offline thank you so much for watching
50:05 - and lending your opinion i really
50:06 - appreciate it and again thank you for
50:09 - the the workshop i love the workshop and
50:12 - i learned so much it's going to help me
50:14 - with with my job
50:16 - so
50:17 - again thank you that's uh that's awesome
50:24 - okay all right so at this point
50:27 - i still want to hear your opinions
50:29 - either now on the live chat or
50:33 - um
50:34 - later on in the comments
50:36 - uh if you don't want to say anything
50:37 - publicly you can always dm me on twitter
50:39 - if you want
50:40 - but
50:42 - i'm going to go now and start reading
50:44 - some of the other questions that aren't
50:45 - directly related to
50:47 - deployment
50:49 - i did have a comment from harshit
50:50 - harshit says add aws rds to that list so
50:54 - we're talking about the sql list then
51:02 - anyway i'm sure there's a little delay
51:04 - but our should let me know
51:06 - i couldn't remember what the aws
51:08 - equivalent of cloud sql was
51:17 - uh so let me scroll up a bit
51:20 - so i don't miss any of these questions
51:21 - so scan through them
51:44 - let's see
51:57 - okay chris uh asks if i've done anything
52:00 - with css grid yet
52:02 - i've just done a little bit with css
52:04 - grid so uh it's something that is
52:07 - definitely on my list of things to
52:10 - research more
52:12 - i i would love to know more i've i've
52:14 - actually found some tutorials that i
52:16 - i've like put in my
52:18 - the links to in my google keep like hey
52:21 - i want to do this and then i just
52:22 - haven't really had time to get
52:25 - um
52:28 - to kind of do it
52:30 - so definitely want to learn more about
52:33 - grid because from what i've heard from
52:35 - other developers like that's that's
52:36 - where it's at
52:45 - oh okay so harshit says the aws rds
52:48 - stands for relational database system
52:52 - cool
52:53 - that act that's an aws name that
52:55 - actually makes sense right relational
52:57 - database system definitely makes sense
53:04 - harshit says i will catch up the stream
53:06 - not sure why you need digital droplets
53:09 - on top of those services oh these aren't
53:12 - the digitization droplets this is the
53:14 - these are the backup plans
53:16 - in case for some reason i can't do the
53:19 - primary so on each one of these the
53:21 - first option is what i want to do
53:24 - but if that doesn't work out for some
53:26 - reason the other options are potential
53:29 - backups so i'm not intending on doing
53:32 - all of these things just one in each
53:35 - category
53:36 - i keep
53:37 - i keep moving my mouse on the wrong side
53:39 - this is the side that you're probably
53:41 - looking at
53:54 - joshua says what would you recommend for
53:57 - a geolocation api that could tell if
53:59 - you're standing next to someone i was
54:01 - thinking google places but was looking
54:03 - for some feedback
54:05 - um
54:19 - i'm trying to think uh i've used like
54:21 - google
54:22 - google's geolocation stuff before but
54:24 - it's been a really long time
54:27 - trying to tell whether you're standing
54:29 - next to a person might
54:31 - it might be a little bit difficult to
54:32 - get that accurate like
54:35 - trying to tell if you're within a
54:36 - certain range of a person is definitely
54:38 - doable i i suppose assuming that person
54:42 - also has the location services enabled
54:44 - and you have access to theirs
54:47 - but like
54:48 - let's say if there's like five people
54:50 - that all have that enabled i mean
54:54 - i don't know i guess it could
54:57 - yeah now i think about it i i think
54:59 - that's definitely possible
55:02 - uh with with google's
55:05 - geo location services
55:13 - harshit says
55:15 - you could easily spin up rds cluster
55:17 - that will give user and password added
55:19 - wp config and database done
55:22 - yeah
55:23 - yeah definitely it's uh harsha
55:26 - that's what i'm hoping for
55:28 - uh the only is like i um
55:31 - i'm pretty sure you do the same thing
55:32 - with the cloud sql so i'm kind of like
55:36 - just wondering
55:39 - which one should
55:41 - we go with i also want to talk to
55:45 - the other developer that works in my
55:46 - department to see what he thinks
55:49 - and he handles the accounts like the
55:52 - billing for the accounts so i want to
55:53 - see like
55:54 - in his opinion what would be easier to
55:56 - set up
55:58 - billing wise right now
56:01 - so that may
56:03 - that may be a big factor as well because
56:06 - i don't want to i don't want any trouble
56:08 - in this process of getting all the
56:09 - accounts set up i wanted to go as
56:11 - quickly and smoothly as possible
56:13 - so
56:15 - i like i i think either one of these aws
56:18 - or google will work
56:20 - just kind of not exactly sure which one
56:22 - to go with at this point
56:26 - okay
56:28 - well i've gotten to the end it seems
56:30 - like i've answered all the questions if
56:31 - you have any more questions throw them
56:33 - in here if you get them in in the next
56:34 - minute or so i'll see them and i'll be
56:36 - able to answer
56:37 - um otherwise i think i'll finish up with
56:40 - this stream
56:41 - and uh probably do a little bit more
56:43 - research on this
56:45 - and our our streams coming up over the
56:48 - next week we'll assuming i can get the
56:50 - billing and accounts set up soon
56:52 - our next streams will be
56:55 - basically deploying all this stuff
57:07 - joshua says thanks a bunch yeah no
57:08 - problem
57:14 - uh mad duchess
57:16 - responding to someone else says
57:18 - csstricks.com has awesome tips for all
57:20 - css but also on grid there are a lot of
57:22 - articles about css on that site yeah
57:24 - definitely i've i've
57:27 - definitely used some of the articles on
57:28 - csstricks.com before that's a great
57:30 - resource
57:38 - robocop says nice stream thanks
57:42 - thanks i appreciate that
57:44 - all right well i think i'm gonna finish
57:45 - up now
57:47 - and um
57:48 - yeah if if any of you watching later on
57:51 - or watching right now think of something
57:53 - or some options um or warnings for me
57:56 - for this setup later on please let me
57:58 - know dm me comment whatever you want
58:02 - um but
58:03 - you know definitely would like all the
58:05 - input uh that i can especially for those
58:08 - of you who have actually used these
58:09 - projects before
58:11 - uh can give me some
58:13 - you know kind of good uh input that i
58:15 - may not be able to read anywhere else
58:19 - okay i think that's it
58:21 - uh i'm gonna do my best to try to stream
58:23 - as many days as i can this week
58:26 - and so hopefully i'll be seeing you a
58:29 - lot this week to make up for all the
58:31 - times i didn't stream last week
58:33 - and so in until
58:36 - probably tomorrow's stream
58:38 - uh
58:39 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do something a little bit different i don't think we've ever dedicated an entire show to planning but it's going to be collaborative planning so i i expect and i hope that there will be a lot of input from you and i'll start out by giving you a rough sketch of what i think we should do to deploy the various parts of this project that we've been working on for for months now um and then i want to get your input to see you know is that plan even reasonable is there something i'm missing like maybe something that could go wrong or some better way to do it and then i'd like to take each piece and come up with a backup plan because you never know what could happen so i want to have a fallback and this will all be in preparation for the upcoming launch in june and i figure once we break things down and have a plan then in future streams we can dedicate a stream to each piece of the plan deploy it all together i'd also like to maybe do some tutorial videos that aren't live that are a little bit more well thought out and don't include all my normal mistakes so after we do a stream uh then and i get it to work then maybe i'll repeat the process with a test you know version and then have that video on my youtube channel that way it'll be a little bit easier for you all to go back and and reference if you want to do it yourself okay so great looks like we're up to a good amount of viewers here so i do want to say last week i didn't stream very much i think only once that's because i was at the revolution conference in virginia beach which was an awesome conference and if anybody gets a chance to go to that conference next year i definitely recommend it one of my favorite conferences uh the people there were very nice and i i attended a whole day of workshops on the second day of the conference and learned some really awesome things like i built an alexa skill uh which actually got accepted and it's live now so it's just a basic skill called weird and weird in fact it's weirton we're 10 facts and weirdtoon is my hometown so it just gives you some you know random facts about my hometown so that was kind of my first first alexa skill kept it really simple and then in my other workshop that's where i got a lot of the ideas that i'm going to share with you today so shout out to francisca i don't remember her last name no um you know what i i gave her a shout out in the tweet my latest tweet so check it out if you want to see her name but she works for google and she gave an awesome workshop on a lot of google cloud stuff and we built a little a little node app on google cloud so you can check out that tweet if you want to know more about her and i think we're going to get started so the way i'm going to do this i'm going to set a pomodoro timer during that time we're just going to talk about and discuss things related to deployment if you have any other questions like general coding questions or really anything in general you want to know my favorite color go ahead and ask it but i'm going to save those questions for our fiveminute breaks and then i'll save it for the very end of the stream once we get through all the deployment stuff and then that way that'll help us stay focused a little bit but you shouldn't have to wait too long to get your question answered oh awesome um francisca is is here i hope i'm pronouncing your first name right let me know if i'm not i i really would like to pronounce it right and uh great so if i mess anything up in terms of google cloud stuff i hopefully uh you know you'll be able to correct me there so let me start this pomodoro session if you're not familiar with pomodoro session it's it can vary a bit but it's usually 25 minutes with a five minute break all right so i'm just gonna do this in markdown i thought about opening up uh google doc or something to kind of mark down my my plans or write up the plans but i thought hey like we do coding why not do it in vs code and markdown uh so um it'll look prettier on the right hand side so if you follow along you can check that out and here's i'm gonna go down through and just give you my my vision for how this is going to deploy so let's take that react part first so we have our react project which is you know node we have express running uh we we built that out with next js um we're using apollo for graphql so if you all seen any of the streams you know you know how that is we've already successfully deployed it using now which is from the same company that makes js it's zeit so that's a really easy deployment it scales it's fast i want to use that because then that takes away the burden of server maintenance i love the fact that it scales so it should be able to handle whatever traffic and updating things is super easy there's no downtime so that's the the strategy now so let's go and do a small heading for all these subplants so let's just call this the the react app we'll do a small heading and then we're just going to do a list we're going to say now is is going to be our deployment so that one's pretty simple uh i think that one is is not really going to be where the debate's at although uh nikki says is your mic pointed at your pc okay you know what my mic did fall down a bit it came loose so i didn't notice it until you just said that let me there we go i hope that's better i'm gonna move it a bit closer to me as well and away from my my computer all right cool so that should be better sorry about that um i'm going to do my best to keep my eye on the live chat to see if there's anything related to our deployment all right so now the next part we're gonna do uh so let's do react the next part is gonna be our our database so my so we have a mysql database and i'll go in and fill out the rest here files okay so this is a good layout for kind of the structure of what we'll need so for our mysql database right now it's linked up on a digital ocean droplet so we have one droplet it's just a cheap five dollar droplet and it has our wordpress installation any files associated with that and then it also has the mysql database all right there so i don't want to keep it like that the reason being uh well obviously a five dollar droplet is not going to do it we'd have to increase the size of the droplets significantly but then that also provides us with a single point of failure we could stay in digital ocean and one option that i have thought of and this could probably be our backup is to use multiple droplets so we would have multiple instances of my sequel and wordpress and load balance between them and then somehow make sure they're all in sync at all times to me that's a lot of work for some and it's something that i've never attempted before so that's why i say probably better for a backup um oh no i'm not showing my screen i'm sorry anyway here's what i've been typing so sorry i'm just i'm really excited about this so i i'm forgetting little things okay so here's where we're at so for our react app we're gonna use now as our primary and uh we'll we'll also come up with some a backup for that as well so there we are thank you for saying something who said steven said i can't see the layout uh who can't see okay so it looks like a lot of you said you can't see the layout oh so sorry um it's been a while since i've done that one uh forgotten to show the screen but it happens you think after a year doing live streams over a year now i would remember that but still don't okay so to solve the complexity issues of having multiple databases and trying to keep them in sync i thought why not go with one of these cloud hosted database services so there are several options out there because i did a workshop with google cloud i think it would be easier for me and i'd be a little bit more comfortable if i went with google's uh cloud sql uh stuff so let me show you what i'm talking about and i'll paste the link in for you because i have this up at least i did have it up where is it at i hope i didn't close it out oh no here it is uh let me go back i'm actually in the console to start setting it up so i want to back up and go to just kind of like the sales page and info page for it so here's what what i'm talking about when i'm talking about the cloud sql okay so it's a part of google cloud and i'm going to paste this into the chat the live chat so you all can check it out if you want and if if you click on that and it doesn't take you the right place please try copying and pasting it there's often some issues with the links if you paste them into the live chat so this would definitely work we're obviously going to go with the my sequel option but here's what i a few of the parts that really stood out to me as to why i want to do with with this um fully managed right so automatic backups right that's that's awesome automatic updates right those are two big things that we need to have that i won't have to worry about anymore and uh you all that have been watching for a while you know that it i get pulled off projects and onto other projects and have deadlines so it's very easy for me to forget stuff like that that really nobody else is gonna nobody hire up and is gonna say like make sure you do those updates they're not even gonna realize we need updates or we need backups or anything the only time anybody is gonna be worried about that is if something wrong happens and then they'll say well didn't we have any backups so having that taken care of is going to just free up so much time and worry from me so that alone i think makes it worth it but also the performance like i doubt i'm going to be able to match that performance if i just stick with setting up my own droplets same way with reliability i love this so digitalocean as far as i know i haven't researched myself but a colleague of mine here has researched the security certificates on digitalocean and they are okay but they definitely don't rise to this level of security so i mean look we we're not going to do anything hipaa related but if we wanted to we'd even be good for hipaa if you're not familiar with that here in the united states at least uh if you're doing anything with people's medical data you need to be hipaa compliant so it's it's kind of a pretty high level of security that's required so basically we have all these certificates and more if you dig into the documentation there's even more certificates that i can present to auditors when they come in or let's say like the head of the it department here and say you know if there's ever any question about well how we set this up i can say listen all of the data we have for this site is in a secure place you know it's these certificates are provided so that's it's not always a big deal depending on who your client is or what you're working on but here in this setting we do go through uh data security audits and things so it's it's definitely important for me to have that okay so that's just a little overview i'm going to check the live chat see if there's any questions all right i don't see anything yet which i mean which is okay i guess it's good so i guess that means what i've been saying so far makes sense so we're gonna we're gonna go over here and i'm going to say google cloud sql will be our option one whoops click in the wrong place okay so that's going to be our option and i want you all to think of some backups because i told you a backup that i thought of doing but realistically i i don't want to have to do that with with the short amount of time we have until launch i'm not confident that i can get that working reliably in that amount of time um okay now we also have wordpress right so for wordpress it's currently on that same digital ocean droplet that we talked about a few minutes ago um okay we did just so phoenix just said you tweeted that you want to discuss something from revconf here yeah so the ideas that i'm getting for the cloud sql database and then also down here for the files and images which we haven't gone over yet i got those ideas from um francisca's workshop at revconf so that's what i want to talk to you mainly about if anybody has any other questions about refcoff let me know we can get to those later i'm thinking about maybe doing a recap video from revconf and putting it on my youtube channel links in the description so i'd love to do that as soon as i can realistically though uh i will be very busy until the site launches so i can't promise you that that will come out soon but i'd like to i'd like to at least make the video while it's still fresh in my mind uh okay so for the wordpress here's what i'm thinking alright i've never done this before but as far as i know it is possible to host wordpress with now so if you're not familiar with now essentially all right from from my perspective from a user's perspective with now a user being like the developer right who's using now as a service you type in a command on the command line and your site is launched that's it it's that easy if you want your site to use a custom url which we will it's just another command super easy deployments right so that's the benefit of now and then you don't have to worry about the server uh managing a server or anything like that it takes care of scaling all that so we're already using this successfully for a react app but for wordpress what we need though is to decouple from wordpress not only the database but also the files okay so to be honest with you i'm not a hundred percent certain that we have to decouple the files but i assume that you would have to uh and i want to i've wanted to anyway um so our my first idea here to go with this is plan a is going to be used now and i'm just going to say uh backup our backup plan is going to be digitalocean and if you all come up with any better backup plans please let me know but we can still take out the files the database and everything and go with digitalocean and uh just do load balancing on digitalocean they set up so you can do automatic load balancing we did that for way back for project one last year and that that worked we didn't use it with wordpress we used it with react but it did work so at least we know how to set up the load balancing there so i think this is a decent backup but not ideal due to some of the things that um that i mentioned earlier okay so that leaves our our final our final thing here are the files so there's two big reasons why i think we should host the files somewhere other than you know on a droplet uh tightly coupled there to our wordpress install number one we need to migrate a ton of files from the old system which is based on ektron and is currently hosted on campus here just a few buildings away so i need to be able to store those somewhere else and keep the file structure it's i could do that on digital ocean i would have to get extra storage for the droplet though um and then again there's the the whole management of it right i still have to manage that number two is when i want a user when a user is going to upload a file to wordpress right so whether that be me or somebody else in my department or even users from other departments that we're going to train over the course of this next year after this launches we're going to train go department by department do training give them their own wordpress accounts limited access so they can update their own content they're going to want to upload documents and images i don't want those to just go on the droplet you know let's say it gets out of hand people start uploading a ton of really big things it could take up the space on a droplet quickly i don't want to go overkill and pay for a ton of space but i also don't want to get taken off guard and fill up all the space in my droplet so something like google's cloud storage buckets i think would work better it would give us more flexibility in terms of storage and it would have availability so let me show you what i'm thinking with google's cloud storage so again i have the documentation open and not like the sales page so let me go back to the sales page here the sales page has like the main points that you want and the nice looking graphics so that's why i'm going with that um products let's see storage cloud storage i think i'm still partially in the documentation part of it these cases features good features no all right i was kind of hoping for a different page let me see oh well i'll just go back to the page i was on i i think it's fresh enough in my mind that i can explain this a little bit more without it and i did actually have a storage bucket that i created from the uh from the conference from the workshop that we could go to if i need to get into it a little more i don't really want to get into technical stuff but just say like um essentially you could see the prices think of like think of dropbox or google drive or microsoft onedrive right think of that but being able to drop all your files in there and have them available for consumption at a url for websites that's that's kind of like what we have here and we're paying a price per gigabyte per month okay which i love that so that means we pay for what we have in there if we put more in there we pay more but we're not we don't have like this fixed limit which is what i was afraid of i don't want to overpay and i also don't want to get stuck so this will allow us to scale nicely uh i can come in on a regular basis and clean things up if i need to and say like yeah we don't need five of these images or so and so uploaded like this gigantic 5k video or something crazy uh and we definitely don't need that uh so i i love that and i love the fact that i don't have to worry about like backups i don't have to worry about um like providing for that on my on my own like maintenance to that server it's it's taken care of so this is since i work with this already at revconf i feel more confident working with google's product i know amazon offers similar uh product i assume microsoft does i'm not 100 sure though but i think given the timeline i could probably set this up more quickly than i could otherwise my department already has a google account set up with billing attached so i just need to make sure and talk to some people who understand how the billing process works here i try to keep myself out of that because it's just a lot of extra paperwork so i got to talk to my colleague and make sure that uh we don't get in trouble first for setting up this account but i'd like to set that up soon and i'd like to do that on the live stream coming up soon uh so i'm just going to go with on here i'm going to say google cloud storage okay so these are mostly just like the plans plan a right we still need our plan b's our backup plans so that's kind of what i want to discuss whether or not number one whether or not these plan plan a's are any good or if there's something i'm missing and then number two what should plan b b especially if any of you have used any of this stuff for something similar on a real project i definitely want your uh your input i'm gonna check my timer too so we got about five minutes and then i'll get to some of the questions that are unrelated uh let me scroll up a bit make sure i haven't missed anything let's see six all right so so far i haven't had any comments on this um outline okay so uh arunesh says aws s3 should be good s3 is the storage stuff right you know how aws is and you don't you don't know what anything means if somebody already hasn't made a browser plugin that translate aws's names into something more reasonable then you should somebody should make it maybe i'll try to make it but i did work with some aws stuff as well when i did that alexa skill workshop um realistically though i think if if i'm gonna use google cloud sql and google cloud storage that's fine if i'm gonna switch and do something with amazon with aws i'd rather do aws for both because that's just one less account that i have to worry about managing so i'm open to it i just want to know what are the differences between going with aws and that that's amazon web services if you're not familiar with the uh with the name so going with amazon versus going with google what are the differences uh is there any good reason to go with one or the other let's see okay nikki says uh nikki doesn't have experience but heard uh westboss uh and scott tolinski talk about cloudanry for image storage on the syntax podcast uh nikki also says that's a great podcast you know what i haven't listened to that one yet i'll have to add that to my podcast actually i do want to give a shout out to um the tales from the script podcast uh so the guy who does that podcast i got to meet him and hang out with him at revconf and super nice guy so check that out also there's a podcast called dark net diaries if you're interested in like hackers and things like that in security check out darknet diaries podcast i binge listened to that on the way back from revconf and i listened to every episode it was that good so definitely check that out okay arnesh says aws s3 which is their storage has a good backup strategy okay all right that's cool definitely need to look into that steven says westboss likes cloudnary a lot i wonder now i'm just saying i i have no proof of this but if they mention cloudnary a lot on their podcast are they getting referral credit or something for cloudnery um that doesn't mean culinary's not good it just makes me wonder okay back we got another suggestion called backblaze arnesh says aws s3 is the cheapest oh nikki says yes they are they are sponsored and are upfront about it okay okay let me uh mark down some of these suggestions for our storage here so we're going to add as potential options aws s3 we're also going to add cloudinary and then the last one that was mentioned i've never heard of before uh back blaze back blaze okay so these are gonna be our options that we need to look into i don't have a ton of time to spend on researching this so i'm just going to look into them a little bit more so if you all have some reasons why you would recommend one over all the others let me know that would be very helpful let's see oh let me i'm going to do the five minute break right now so during this five minute break i'm going to answer any questions that are unrelated to our current topic after that we're going to reset the timer we're going to get back to the discussion make sure we have backup plans for each one of the things the pieces that need to deploy all right so we have a lot of people saying hi i'm not gonna go through everybody but if you did say hi i'm saying hi back to you right now i do see all the hellos let's see oh nikki uh said uh just published uh part two of uh fresh dev environment blog post so cool everybody check that out if you can michael says you remember when your boss used to go away to team building conference i've got a feeling this is going to be like that who some asked if i would make an algorithm course uh i could i tell you truth i might not be the best person to make an algorithm course i mean i've i've done them successfully but uh i that wouldn't be top on my list of things i would feel confident that i could contribute something but i'm open to it i'll uh definitely add that to the list of potential video tutorials and things that i could make let's see uh okay michael's uh michael who's with us frequently on the live stream is having trouble with his internet which that's that really stinks sorry about if you're still with us sorry about that michael if you if you can't watch it now but you can watch it later on uh you know definitely just put your input into the comments or dm me or something and uh i i would still appreciate you your opinion on these things okay uh rick adams says which book and or video titles uh are recommended for a thorough base of software development regarding object oriented programming sql or sql depending how you like to say it um rbdb design and scripting in java oh i don't i don't really know uh you know because i don't deal with like java at all and i minimally deal with sql and realistically like you know uh with react we're not really doing objectoriented programming so i don't really know does anyone else have any suggestions for books or videos on those topics if you do please let us know in the live chat or if you're watching later on please throw it in the comments to the video phoenix said i once listened to that meaning the dark net diaries podcast and never again since i started having thoughts about the dark about darknet bad thoughts yeah well if you've ever been tempted to be uh you know a bad hacker then um maybe that's not the show for you it'd be too tempting uh lawson arts3 asks what's the question uh basically our question now is what are the best ways to handle these different pieces of the deployment that we need to do for our current project that's project five in this video series um so in particular if you have any opinion about any of these products for file storage you know please let let me know francisco says as far as i know on standard products like stores the large providers are all equally good and similarly priced it's probably simpler if you have one provider for all your services okay cool yeah i definitely agree on having one provider for all the services so uh and thank you for that let's see okay so cloud storage uh azure is expensive okay so azure is maybe we didn't even have that as an option so i'm not going to add it in right now nobody really suggested it but that would be microsoft's version of this joshua asked why i'm using wordpress for the front end we're not using wordpress for the front end react is the front end wordpress is just handling our content management i needed something that uh was very user friendly for the people that are gonna have to edit this because we're going to have a lot of people that have no coding experience editing this uh so wordpress does provide that i think a pretty pretty simple user experience and it also has a huge uh community of developers you know that i can reach out to if i need help to customize some things i do have somewhat of a background in wordpress as well when i freelanced i used to do a lot of wordpress sites because it seems like every small business has a wordpress site all right let's go back and we'll do one more pomodoro session we may not even take the whole session and then i'll go back and make sure i've answered all the questions here uh but i want to to go back and fill this list out a little bit more so keep it coming with all the ideas definitely appreciate it i've already had a few ideas that i never thought of because i've never heard of these services let's see let's see all right uh lawson says all i know about them is aws seems aws is the most solid choice not considering price or firebase is from what i've seen okay yeah so firebase being a google product i don't think we'll need firebase though uh i mean we're because we definitely already have the data in a sql database so i would don't i don't want to convert you know i don't want to switch it over but um so that's why i'd rather go with a you know cloud sql amazon does have something similar as well so we could go with that okay harsh it's here hey how's it going harsh it uh as you can see on the screen these are uh some of the options that we're going with for deployment for each part of our of our project so if you have any opinion on any of these please let me know okay so keep the suggestions coming i think i've gotten through all of them i want to talk a little bit about backup plans for some of these so for our react app we may be able to go with if we can't go with now for whatever reason i'm i'm not going to speculate on why let's let's just say it we can't go with now our backup of course could be load balanced digital ocean droplets okay why digital ocean well we already have an account with digitalocean so that would be faster but realistically could we do something with a different provider yeah we definitely could um you know amazon google microsoft or any other number of providers we could probably do the same thing for i like that digitalocean has a really easy load balancing built in i don't have enough experience with other options to know if their load balancing is as easy okay but this takes a little bit more work we would have to keep up with the updates and maintenance on all these servers so that's why that's definitely a backup plan if anybody has any other options for backup plans that may be better than that please let me know it says let's see okay bo bo's here i didn't see uh so bo karns who does uh a ton of stuff for the free code camp youtube channel is here uh so good to have you here and we have some more uh opinions on what we should do here so um quinny's says digitalocean has spaces with backups as data storage as well doesn't it you know what i believe they do so i i do believe digitalocean has the data storage uh backups and things too so maybe you know what maybe we should add digitalocean here as well as an option makes sense we already have an account with them and i believe someone else in my department has used the storage in digitalocean so i'll be able to talk to them and see what they thought of it uh bovin says are you looking uh also looking for network latency problem many times we experience in some regions of the world websites load very slow due to network latency uh well yeah i'm i definitely want to avoid latency as much as possible uh i'm not sure other than trying to make my site as small and fast as possible i'm not sure what else i could do in in terms of helping with network latency matt duchess says perfect timing for this topic working on mine thanks you're welcome i'm i'm glad hopefully this will be helpful to you oh okay stephen has a in a very reliable kind of old school uh method here steven says how about a couple of thumb drives and dvdr archives yeah we could add that in the mix right you know it'll def it'll be totally offline we don't have to worry about hackers getting in stealing or corrupting our data right that would be actually hilarious just to have like a little piece of artwork hanging in my office that are like the entire website and thumb drives or something like that maybe i'll have it in glass that says break in case of emergency just harshit says by the way you will be working using docker for wordpress now yes so that's let me let me just show you a little bit of the details about how this would would need to work so i've already forked the example um for how to use wordpress with now so if you check out this fus marcom here i'll give you a link to it uh so our organization that we've been building our all our stuff and now has a fork of this so that we can modify it if we need to but basically yes we we have a docker file and that's where uh things things run so if you see like this is where we get all the wordpress stuff right and they actually have send grid built in if we need to do emails we aren't we aren't going to need the send grid part of this or at least we aren't going to use it i'm not sure yet if we need it uh so that wordpress will still work there are some parts of wordpress that auto send emails you know to like people when they sign in as users or uh to whoever the admin is which would probably be me whenever new users users sign in so we may need the email just for that sort of thing so might keep it but essentially you know for those of you who know docker this will make more sense to you uh but these are all the instructions to get wordpress up and running within that docker container um so i need to spend more time kind of studying this to figure out because there are a few things in use here that i've never used before so harshit mentions uh hhvm i've never even heard of that before much less used it so that's one of the things i want to research more about harshad says it will be two times faster than php5 hey well i like that anything to make it faster is good so so if anybody knows a little bit more about docker and can kind of see what's going on or you want to use the link to um you know to check it out inspect it a little bit more depth you know if you have some some input for me that would be great but this is the official example if you go to the now documentation and you look up wordpress this is where they point you uh so it's um it's at least trusted by the now team to use with wordpress uh so i'm kind of basing my confidence on on that uh michael creel has a good point says not sure how wordpress works when you finally hand it off you're going to need a lot of validation rules uh if they're going to be less experienced people working on it i paraphrased a bit but um yeah yes you're right uh we're def that's why we're holding off on giving other people access right now and we're gonna slowly roll it out and train people over the next year one of the one of the big reasons other than just the time it takes for training is making sure that we set it up in a way that users have as much freedom as possible without really the ability to mess things up too much so we're definitely going to be working on that okay let me go back here and say so basically we have our plans and then backups for everything except this um google cloud sql um and i'm gonna put here as a slash slash aws because you know as we mentioned earlier you know if we decide to go with google here we're gonna go with google you know down here as well if we decide to go with aws it's going to be aws you know pretty much across the board but as a backup let me know what you think about you know essentially doing something like this right load balance situation droplets and actually i let me change this to say load balance situation droplets here okay now if you're not familiar with with how we've done this in the past essentially what you do is have droplets that are exactly the same so let's we run a few droplets that are exactly the same and then we would use digital oceans load balancing service which is an extra 20 a month and then they would handle a lot of the technical details of it we would just have control over a few settings and then they would you know they the load balancing would be handled so for each time we do this for the react app that adds an extra 20 for the database extra 20 for wordpress and extra 20. uh so that's an extra 60 a month that potentially we wouldn't really need uh just for the load balancing and then on top of that we need the droplets so we'd have to pay for each one of the droplets so i believe that using now and some sort of cloud service here would end up being easier to manage and also less expensive uh also easier to scale let's see we have a few more opinions on this as well so let's see uh harshit says aws rds is also good easy to set up uh use docker for my sequel with volume but i guess that would be overkill francisca says i have to run thanks for the stream watch we'll catch the rest offline thank you so much for watching and lending your opinion i really appreciate it and again thank you for the the workshop i love the workshop and i learned so much it's going to help me with with my job so again thank you that's uh that's awesome okay all right so at this point i still want to hear your opinions either now on the live chat or um later on in the comments uh if you don't want to say anything publicly you can always dm me on twitter if you want but i'm going to go now and start reading some of the other questions that aren't directly related to deployment i did have a comment from harshit harshit says add aws rds to that list so we're talking about the sql list then anyway i'm sure there's a little delay but our should let me know i couldn't remember what the aws equivalent of cloud sql was uh so let me scroll up a bit so i don't miss any of these questions so scan through them let's see okay chris uh asks if i've done anything with css grid yet i've just done a little bit with css grid so uh it's something that is definitely on my list of things to research more i i would love to know more i've i've actually found some tutorials that i i've like put in my the links to in my google keep like hey i want to do this and then i just haven't really had time to get um to kind of do it so definitely want to learn more about grid because from what i've heard from other developers like that's that's where it's at oh okay so harshit says the aws rds stands for relational database system cool that act that's an aws name that actually makes sense right relational database system definitely makes sense harshit says i will catch up the stream not sure why you need digital droplets on top of those services oh these aren't the digitization droplets this is the these are the backup plans in case for some reason i can't do the primary so on each one of these the first option is what i want to do but if that doesn't work out for some reason the other options are potential backups so i'm not intending on doing all of these things just one in each category i keep i keep moving my mouse on the wrong side this is the side that you're probably looking at joshua says what would you recommend for a geolocation api that could tell if you're standing next to someone i was thinking google places but was looking for some feedback um i'm trying to think uh i've used like google google's geolocation stuff before but it's been a really long time trying to tell whether you're standing next to a person might it might be a little bit difficult to get that accurate like trying to tell if you're within a certain range of a person is definitely doable i i suppose assuming that person also has the location services enabled and you have access to theirs but like let's say if there's like five people that all have that enabled i mean i don't know i guess it could yeah now i think about it i i think that's definitely possible uh with with google's geo location services harshit says you could easily spin up rds cluster that will give user and password added wp config and database done yeah yeah definitely it's uh harsha that's what i'm hoping for uh the only is like i um i'm pretty sure you do the same thing with the cloud sql so i'm kind of like just wondering which one should we go with i also want to talk to the other developer that works in my department to see what he thinks and he handles the accounts like the billing for the accounts so i want to see like in his opinion what would be easier to set up billing wise right now so that may that may be a big factor as well because i don't want to i don't want any trouble in this process of getting all the accounts set up i wanted to go as quickly and smoothly as possible so i like i i think either one of these aws or google will work just kind of not exactly sure which one to go with at this point okay well i've gotten to the end it seems like i've answered all the questions if you have any more questions throw them in here if you get them in in the next minute or so i'll see them and i'll be able to answer um otherwise i think i'll finish up with this stream and uh probably do a little bit more research on this and our our streams coming up over the next week we'll assuming i can get the billing and accounts set up soon our next streams will be basically deploying all this stuff joshua says thanks a bunch yeah no problem uh mad duchess responding to someone else says csstricks.com has awesome tips for all css but also on grid there are a lot of articles about css on that site yeah definitely i've i've definitely used some of the articles on csstricks.com before that's a great resource robocop says nice stream thanks thanks i appreciate that all right well i think i'm gonna finish up now and um yeah if if any of you watching later on or watching right now think of something or some options um or warnings for me for this setup later on please let me know dm me comment whatever you want um but you know definitely would like all the input uh that i can especially for those of you who have actually used these projects before uh can give me some you know kind of good uh input that i may not be able to read anywhere else okay i think that's it uh i'm gonna do my best to try to stream as many days as i can this week and so hopefully i'll be seeing you a lot this week to make up for all the times i didn't stream last week and so in until probably tomorrow's stream uh have a great day
