00:07 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse
00:10 - sorry about the delay
00:12 - i was trying to get
00:13 - uh everything set up right something is
00:16 - making my fan
00:18 - uh run
00:20 - like really high
00:22 - and so i've been closing down windows
00:24 - and
00:25 - if i had more time i just would have
00:27 - restarted the computer completely but i
00:30 - didn't want it to affect the video
00:31 - quality because i'm noticing like the
00:33 - last day or two
00:34 - the fans been running
00:36 - uh pretty loudly
00:38 - and they'll be weird parts of the videos
00:41 - either recording or the streams where
00:45 - things just kind of slow down a little
00:47 - bit
00:49 - anyway
00:51 - i think it's working now
00:53 - let me know if there's something wrong
00:55 - with the quality
00:58 - and i'll do what i can to get that fixed
01:02 - all right so hey everyone see a lot of
01:04 - people in the live chat saying hello
01:08 - all right so here's the plan today
01:12 - we're gonna do
01:13 - pretty much what we did yesterday
01:16 - uh maybe we'll get into some different
01:17 - things but we're still gonna keep
01:19 - working on this this site
01:22 - and
01:23 - if you're just joining us for the first
01:26 - time or you haven't been around for a
01:27 - while
01:29 - this is
01:30 - working with react we're working with
01:32 - graphql
01:34 - nexjs
01:35 - uh we're using wordpress as uh headless
01:39 - cms
01:41 - um so we have a lot going on we're doing
01:44 - some transfer data from one database to
01:46 - another
01:48 - uh
01:49 - so we're gonna do a little bit of you
01:51 - know whatever we need to do today
01:53 - to get things moving
01:55 - so i had a meeting this morning and i
01:57 - kind of reported on our progress for the
01:59 - site and
02:02 - i think
02:04 - most of people were impressed
02:06 - by how it's coming they're they're
02:08 - anxious to see something so it'd be cool
02:10 - to get it to a point where
02:12 - it'd be reasonable to allow other people
02:14 - to see it and test it
02:18 - all right
02:22 - hey gideon's here i haven't haven't seen
02:24 - gideon in here for a while uh how's it
02:26 - going gideon
02:30 - you're stuck video's broken oh no the
02:33 - video is broken again
02:36 - huh
02:45 - i just don't understand
02:58 - all right
03:00 - yeah let me switch to the other
03:02 - let's switch to this screen did any of
03:04 - you see the the switch
03:10 - let let me know right now you should see
03:12 - me really small down in the corner um
03:15 - and then
03:17 - you should see the the desktop on one of
03:19 - my screens
03:47 - all right
03:48 - everybody
03:50 - yay looks like everyone can see me well
03:54 - i don't want to say everyone
03:57 - um
03:58 - some of you
04:00 - can see
04:05 - all right so my fan on my computer is
04:07 - still running
04:09 - you know pretty loudly
04:11 - which is weird
04:12 - so i'm still really not sure what the
04:15 - problem is with that
04:18 - um
04:22 - but if it's fine for most people then
04:24 - we'll we'll go with it
04:28 - and
04:35 - so sorry about the delay that's going to
04:37 - be terrible in the recording
04:39 - but at least
04:41 - anybody watching could just skip ahead i
04:42 - guess
04:43 - um
04:46 - rumble bro says if you're using obs drop
04:48 - the video and coding level down a notch
04:51 - uh yeah i'm i'm gonna have to do that
04:53 - it's it's just we i've been using the
04:55 - same settings for the last six months
04:58 - and
05:00 - and they've been fine
05:01 - i haven't changed anything
05:03 - um in fact i've actually
05:06 - doubled the amount of ram i have on my
05:08 - machine
05:09 - so
05:11 - it's just odd that all of a sudden i'm
05:13 - having these problems so
05:15 - uh it
05:16 - maybe after the stream i'll check out my
05:18 - settings lower them a little bit
05:20 - and
05:22 - see
05:23 - see if i can get a better result i
05:24 - definitely want to keep 1080p quality
05:27 - uh because it makes the code so much
05:29 - easier to read
05:32 - um i'm running right now
05:36 - um harsha said check the task manager uh
05:40 - i've i've checked the task manager for
05:43 - uh for chrome well the chrome tab
05:45 - manager
05:46 - uh i've i've checked that
05:48 - and got rid of
05:49 - pretty much everything i'm down to just
05:52 - a few tabs open now
05:54 - um
05:57 - you know i have to have youtube up
05:59 - i have to have the stuff up that i'm
06:01 - working with but pretty much everything
06:02 - else is closed right now
06:05 - i got i'm gonna i closed slack
06:08 - um
06:09 - let me close my email
06:11 - using outlook for work i'm just gonna
06:13 - close everything uh let me close out
06:15 - chrome canary cause i'm not using it
06:17 - right now
06:19 - um obs
06:24 - let's see
06:28 - yeah there's just there's not much else
06:29 - that i could even close out
06:37 - i mean maybe i have
06:39 - i i do have a lot of projects open in
06:42 - visual studio code
06:43 - but i'm working on all those projects
06:46 - um
06:49 - all right i'll ch i'm not gonna check it
06:50 - all out during the stream if it starts
06:52 - to get bad i'll go back and check things
06:54 - out but um thanks i will check the
06:56 - resource monitor on mac
06:59 - and um so thanks uh thanks for the
07:02 - advice
07:03 - uh rumble bros and
07:09 - all right cool i'll make sure i go back
07:11 - through and re-read this advice
07:14 - um
07:16 - when
07:19 - when the stream's over and i'll i'll
07:20 - work on it
07:23 - what's this go to turn harsh it says go
07:26 - to
07:27 - the terminal and type top
07:31 - all right
07:41 - oh nice hard awesome
07:44 - i never knew you could do that
07:46 - all right well let's check this out
07:49 - so here's a really good tip
07:51 - we can see what's going on here
07:54 - um all right
08:03 - all right
08:16 - code helper
08:21 - so
08:22 - i'm guessing
08:24 - that code helper has something to do
08:26 - with visual studio code
08:30 - and that is taking up
08:33 - by far the most
08:35 - oh it's just well chrome is taking up
08:37 - the most
08:38 - it looks like
08:40 - but i can't really do much about
08:43 - the windows i have open now so i need
08:45 - them open
08:47 - all right let's see what i have running
08:49 - on visual studio code and what i can
08:50 - shut down i do have
08:56 - let's see what i don't need
08:59 - and i'll need this
09:08 - and
09:10 - there's my other stuff
09:14 - did they not open
09:20 - ah when i restarted all my uh code
09:22 - windows
09:23 - there they are all right i was worried
09:26 - for a second i'd lost everything
09:28 - all right so this is all right i was
09:30 - working on this but i'm not going to
09:33 - work on it for the stream shall shut
09:34 - that down
09:35 - we will use this one
09:37 - let's make that bigger and
09:39 - we will use
09:42 - let's see what if i have any other
09:43 - things running here
09:46 - no it shouldn't have anything running
09:50 - it's uh
09:54 - all right let me
09:57 - let me close out of that for a second
09:59 - um because i do want to run
10:06 - we're going to need to run this anyway
10:08 - so i'll just get it started right now
10:10 - and then i can start and grow
10:16 - all right
10:29 - all right so i'm going to paste this in
10:31 - the live chat
10:51 - oh okay blake's asking about what i have
10:53 - yeah i have i upgraded to 32 gigs of ram
10:57 - sometime within the last six months or
10:58 - so uh let me see what the rest is about
11:02 - this mac
11:05 - i'll move it over here it's it's really
11:07 - small though i doubt you'll be able to
11:08 - see the text but yeah so i i've
11:12 - 32 gigs of ram
11:15 - um
11:17 - intel core i7
11:24 - 2 gigs graphics
11:26 - all right um
11:34 - yeah i mean that seems like it should be
11:36 - able to handle um live streaming
11:39 - something
11:40 - especially since i've done it
11:42 - um
11:44 - yeah but i'm still it looks like i'm
11:46 - still dropping some frames
11:48 - um
11:50 - dropping like two percent of the frames
11:54 - i need to learn more about how video
11:56 - works if i'm going to live stream every
11:57 - day then maybe i ought to learn how to
12:00 - do this
12:01 - properly
12:03 - um
12:04 - all right so sorry for all the trouble
12:12 - i'll just have to dig more into this
12:15 - at some point hopefully we've closed out
12:18 - enough things that
12:20 - we can just work
12:22 - let me i don't need this open
12:24 - you don't really need that open we are
12:26 - going to work with this
12:29 - and what's this migrate yeah we are
12:31 - working with this
12:32 - so let's leave this open
12:36 - and let's see
12:41 - i guess i can close this out
12:44 - we need one timer open so
12:47 - i'll leave that open
12:50 - and i don't really need this trello
12:52 - board right now
12:57 - are we getting down
12:59 - we're getting down pretty lean here not
13:01 - much else i can do
13:05 - all right
13:12 - all right harsha's asking about the
13:14 - encoding format that i'm using
13:18 - and
13:20 - let's see
13:31 - i'm trying to find
13:32 - it
13:34 - i don't remember offhand what i was
13:36 - using and now i can't remember where
13:38 - it's at
13:40 - in my settings
13:51 - hmm
14:04 - all right
14:08 - oh it looks like
14:11 - looks like it's it's okay now
14:14 - all right yeah let's get to work good
14:17 - good idea hershey um
14:20 - all right so
14:23 - let's at least get this open
14:31 - so here's our site
14:33 - and
14:34 - here's our cute dog
14:38 - this is what we had done uh just kind of
14:40 - get a little layout here still haven't
14:42 - had a chance to show this to my boss i'm
14:44 - gonna try i tried to go in earlier to
14:46 - see him and uh he had already left for
14:48 - lunch
14:50 - so i'm gonna try after the stream today
14:52 - and see if he's in
14:55 - he's just been really busy lately uh
14:58 - with meetings and stuff so
15:02 - let's see
15:04 - yeah so we have some work to do oh i do
15:06 - want to show you before i forget
15:15 - let me show you
15:18 - the uh github repo now because i've
15:20 - updated a lot of things
15:24 - i think i should did i show y'all
15:26 - yesterday
15:27 - i may have but
15:29 - um oops forgot to start the pomodoro
15:32 - timer let's start that up
15:34 - [Music]
15:42 - all right so just to let everyone know
15:45 - um we have a project now and
15:48 - you can check this out
15:50 - you can check things out here or if you
15:52 - just want to go to the issues tab
15:54 - there's a bunch of issues open
15:56 - if anyone's interested in trying to
15:58 - contribute to a project
16:01 - you'll go ahead if you're new and you've
16:02 - never contributed to a project before
16:04 - check these out you can ask me i'd be
16:06 - happy to help you get your first
16:08 - github
16:10 - pool request merged so
16:13 - i'm gonna eventually go through these
16:14 - but i'm gonna hold off a little bit and
16:16 - then that way if anybody does want
16:19 - to contribute these are kind of all laid
16:21 - out you know what needs to be done
16:25 - if you're not exactly sure what needs to
16:26 - be done just you know leave a comment on
16:29 - that issue and then i can give you more
16:31 - information for that
16:34 - so
16:36 - what i think we should do now
16:39 - is
16:41 - let me make sure i'm on the right
16:42 - network
16:44 - all right cool
16:46 - um let's grab some
16:48 - some more data
16:50 - and bring over
16:54 - let's see what i want to bring over
16:59 - let's see if we can bring over our
17:03 - department pages how did the search and
17:05 - put field animated in previous
17:09 - oh all right actually we do have a
17:11 - question about one of these issues now
17:12 - and
17:13 - that's a really good question i
17:16 - i should have put this in here anyway
17:20 - which one is that
17:23 - there we are
17:25 - so for this issue
17:28 - uh on click the search icon in the top
17:31 - bar should expand to reveal a text field
17:34 - so let's let's find a project that this
17:36 - happens on
17:39 - it was the
17:42 - bulletin wasn't it
17:45 - see if i have this up here already
17:50 - i don't think i do
17:53 - i believe we had this working properly
17:55 - on
17:56 - uh the bulletin
18:01 - um
18:05 - yeah let's try that out
18:10 - here let me make this a bit bigger
18:12 - for anybody who's not familiar with
18:14 - using the command line this will be kind
18:15 - of like a little intro because i'm going
18:17 - to do some basic stuff and then i'm
18:19 - going to do some
18:20 - um
18:22 - just a few
18:24 - you know commands with um like starting
18:27 - a server up
18:28 - so
18:29 - we're going to cd um
18:31 - we're going to go so we're going to
18:33 - change our directory and i'm going to go
18:34 - into my projects directory
18:38 - and then i'm going to do an ls and
18:40 - that's going to tell me everything
18:41 - that's in my projects directory and i'm
18:44 - looking for something that's bulletin so
18:46 - bulletin react is the folder i'm looking
18:48 - for so i want to see the end of there
18:52 - bulletin react notice i didn't type it
18:54 - all out
18:55 - i
18:56 - typed in
18:57 - bul and then hit tab and the rest of it
19:00 - auto completed so that's kind of a cool
19:02 - feature it'll save you a lot of time
19:03 - typing and you won't make as many
19:05 - mistakes as you're not trying to type
19:07 - out the whole field so now that we have
19:09 - this
19:10 - um
19:11 - let's open
19:15 - i'm going to open it in a text let's go
19:17 - nano
19:22 - package package.json so i'm going to
19:25 - open it in this this little editor
19:27 - called nano is a really simple editor
19:30 - uh that'll open right right in our
19:34 - right in our terminal you'll see
19:36 - so it just opened here and i can see
19:37 - what's in here i could edit it
19:40 - and it has a lot of the
19:42 - you know commands you can use right here
19:44 - a lot of the keyboard shortcuts
19:46 - but what i want to see is what our
19:48 - startup script is
19:50 - uh looks like start will work for us
19:54 - all right so i'm going to close this out
19:56 - and to close to close this out i just
19:58 - hit control x
20:00 - and that closes out nano since i didn't
20:02 - change anything it didn't ask me if i
20:04 - wanted to save otherwise it would have
20:06 - asked me if i wanted to save so now that
20:08 - i know
20:10 - what our command is
20:12 - we can go yarn
20:14 - start
20:17 - and we've already set up this project to
20:19 - run the servers so
20:22 - this is a little bit different than what
20:24 - you'd normally have if you know a
20:26 - project had been done oops
20:29 - okay so it we already had our main
20:31 - project running on port 3000 so it has
20:34 - started
20:37 - um our project started
20:39 - server started for
20:51 - uh i'm afraid we're running the back end
20:53 - and not the front end one
20:54 - all right
20:56 - let me just shut this down for a second
20:58 - if you hit ctrl c that'll shut down your
21:00 - server generally if you're in if you
21:03 - have something running in your command
21:04 - line you want to get out of it try
21:06 - control c that works for a lot of things
21:09 - so i'm going to restart this
21:12 - and
21:15 - there we are this should be better
21:25 - why is it so slow
21:29 - go closed
21:31 - there we are
21:34 - oh no did we implement the login system
21:37 - no
21:38 - um
21:41 - can i submit no i need to validate
21:49 - i'm not like i'm happy that we have the
21:51 - login system and that's that's awesome
21:53 - but
21:54 - it just slowed me down here it's been a
21:56 - while since we've worked on this project
21:58 - i really do want to finish this up and
22:00 - and launch it but
22:02 - we've we've just gotten sidetracked uh
22:04 - by these other important projects
22:08 - um
22:09 - and i closed on my email which
22:13 - is smart
22:22 - let's um
22:29 - let me open up my email again
22:32 - i think i can get to it from here
22:36 - um
22:38 - whoa oh no
22:40 - i restarted so now even my passwords
22:42 - aren't here
22:43 - it's taking a lot longer i thought
22:59 - and i also authenticate you've got to be
23:02 - kidding me
23:03 - it uses mailtrap
23:11 - saying it it uses mail trap
23:20 - i'm trying to remember what we did i
23:22 - don't remember for sure so are you
23:23 - saying that
23:25 - where it's not actually gonna send the
23:27 - email yet
23:28 - and i need to go to mail trap
23:36 - all right let's check out mailchat
24:07 - all right
24:08 - okay so we did get it in mail trap
24:11 - uh let's see
24:18 - all right here we are
24:24 - yeah
24:25 - all right
24:26 - so hopefully this actually is set up or
24:28 - all this
24:29 - work has been for nothing all right
24:31 - awesome
24:32 - so let's zoom in here and see how this
24:34 - works so we click on it
24:38 - it opens up
24:39 - it automatically uh fills
24:42 - it puts the cursor in here
24:45 - this is just a basic material design
24:47 - style text field
24:49 - but then we also have
24:51 - this close icon and weak so we can close
24:54 - it back up again
24:56 - so that's how we want it to work this is
24:58 - i i would probably change this slightly
25:01 - just uh
25:03 - i would want this to have a little bit
25:05 - slower animation when it opens up
25:08 - and
25:11 - it would be nicer if
25:17 - when this opened the x kind of looked
25:19 - like it was part of this so maybe if the
25:20 - x was here
25:22 - or if this was moved up a bit so it
25:24 - integrated you know a little bit better
25:25 - but basically like this is
25:29 - this is what i want
25:30 - um so even if this was implemented
25:32 - exactly like this i would be happy and
25:34 - if we had time later on i would just
25:37 - kind of adjust it slightly
25:40 - but that's what we want
25:44 - so
25:46 - since this project is using material ui
25:49 - the beta version i believe it is
25:51 - material ui the beta version and
25:54 - it should
25:55 - be able to copy most of that code
25:57 - and it should work
25:59 - uh and all that of course is on on
26:01 - github
26:03 - under the i believe it's bulletin react
26:07 - is the
26:08 - um
26:11 - uh the github project name
26:14 - all right
26:22 - i heard she's talking about the masonry
26:26 - yeah the masonry uses materialize yeah
26:28 - for
26:29 - the masonry stuff so it's a blend and
26:31 - materialize
26:43 - yeah harsh it's
26:45 - i like how this works right here this is
26:48 - good the only thing we're going to have
26:49 - to solve or figure some way around is
26:53 - right now
26:54 - on our main project which we'll go back
26:56 - to in just just a minute uh we have
26:58 - cards that are not only different
27:00 - heights they're also different widths
27:04 - so i i don't think switching to
27:08 - materialized columns is
27:10 - is going to fix that
27:12 - um you know by itself
27:15 - i hope i'm mistaken about that and it
27:17 - does
27:21 - um
27:29 - we'll just we'll have to see we'll have
27:31 - to to mess around but i don't want to
27:33 - spend any more time on the home page
27:34 - until i show to my boss
27:37 - see what he thinks because we may just
27:39 - end up wasting time on something that
27:41 - might not make it into the final version
27:43 - of the site
27:46 - evo says i think i would slightly
27:48 - lighten the shadow under the nav bar it
27:50 - just looks too dark a little too dark
27:52 - for my liking
27:54 - um
27:55 - yeah maybe off to see um if this is
27:59 - basically
28:01 - sorry if you ever see anything
28:04 - uh in any of the projects that seems
28:06 - like it's not in line with um
28:09 - the material design uh standards
28:12 - let me know
28:14 - i would definitely change it if that's
28:15 - the case so if this
28:17 - the shadow recommended for
28:19 - you know the app bar here is not the
28:21 - right shadow i'll change it
28:24 - um you know no problem
28:28 - um i i just i want to keep everything
28:31 - consistent so
28:36 - let's see
28:37 - we'll have to look at it in our other
28:39 - project as well
28:42 - and see if it's this dark i don't
28:43 - remember doing anything custom to dark
28:45 - in this but you never know
28:52 - yeah you're right uh evo says it it just
28:55 - it looks a little out of place you're
28:56 - right with this elevation it does seem
28:58 - odd
28:59 - maybe before i mean this this is still a
29:01 - work in progress right uh so this isn't
29:03 - live anywhere but
29:06 - i mean you could see
29:07 - this obviously has an elevation
29:10 - but then this doesn't
29:12 - and it just makes it it's it's an odd
29:14 - effect here
29:18 - you know if we were to like pan this and
29:20 - be able to look at it like straight on
29:24 - it would be like this is up a lot higher
29:27 - than this side
29:29 - nav you know but from here it looks like
29:31 - they're
29:32 - it's just odd right i mean the way the
29:34 - shadows are
29:38 - there should be something with the
29:40 - shadow right either this should have a
29:41 - shadow here or there should be some sort
29:44 - of slight shadow on this edge
29:47 - so i
29:48 - i agree i think that looks weird i'll
29:51 - have to go back to the documentation see
29:53 - how it's handled there
29:56 - um and then
30:01 - yeah and then we'll figure we'll have to
30:03 - figure it out because even you know
30:04 - right now the sidebar is just completely
30:06 - flat against the background right so
30:08 - it's
30:10 - it has no elevation at all
30:14 - yeah we'll have to end oh well we're not
30:15 - we're not working on this bulletin
30:17 - project today so i'm getting kind of
30:19 - sidetracked but i i definitely agree
30:21 - with you evo i
30:23 - this
30:24 - this does look weird
30:27 - and it kind of breaks the illusion of
30:29 - the different elevations
30:32 - all right so let's
30:34 - close out
30:36 - um
30:38 - oh rook rook says sorry for derailing
30:41 - you from the main site project ah don't
30:43 - worry about it that's i mean that
30:44 - happens this
30:46 - uh
30:48 - i think that's kind of how things always
30:51 - are you see something on one project and
30:53 - it reminds you of something else and you
30:54 - end up you know going around
30:57 - uh it's a different thing so that's just
30:59 - normal what do i have on
31:02 - post support mainstream to materialize
31:04 - oh all right
31:05 - uh i just noticed this issue harshit uh
31:08 - so thanks thanks for making that um an
31:11 - issue i don't
31:12 - yeah i don't think i made one for it so
31:15 - thank you
31:16 - let's
31:18 - shut down this server
31:22 - that was actually two servers the front
31:24 - end and back end
31:26 - and now
31:27 - let's start this one up again
31:30 - for our main project
31:37 - all right so it looks good
31:42 - let's verify that that
31:45 - is working
31:47 - and the ngrok link still should work
31:52 - yeah oh evo don't worry about being
31:53 - nitpicky i mean i
31:55 - nitpicky is good
31:57 - nitpicky i think is the difference
31:58 - between a good site and and a perfect
32:01 - site right a great site because
32:05 - somebody will see that
32:07 - not everybody but someone will see that
32:10 - and
32:11 - if it's good they probably won't even
32:13 - notice but if it's doesn't if it looks
32:16 - weird they will notice and they'll have
32:18 - a bad experience with it
32:23 - all right
32:25 - so let's get started we actually have
32:27 - eight minutes left in this uh pomodoro
32:29 - session and i i will take a break and go
32:32 - back to the live chat because there's a
32:33 - lot
32:34 - uh up top that i i just kind of skipped
32:37 - over
32:39 - john hanson said he saw it too john your
32:42 - uh your light bright thing that you made
32:44 - that shared on twitter it's getting a
32:46 - lot of love on twitter it's getting some
32:48 - retweets and and likes and stuff so
32:51 - everybody likes it so you did a great
32:54 - job on that i shared it with some of my
32:56 - co-workers and they were like
32:59 - making designs on it and screenshotting
33:01 - it and then sending on slack so
33:04 - really cool
33:09 - all right evo says it's like that one
33:11 - smudge you made on your car three years
33:13 - ago which nobody else sees except for
33:15 - you yeah
33:17 - exactly
33:20 - exactly that's
33:23 - that's definitely me i noticed like the
33:25 - one tiny spot on a shirt you know that i
33:28 - got like pasta sauce on a long time ago
33:32 - and it always bothers me if i ever wear
33:34 - that shirt like somebody's gonna see
33:35 - that tiny spot
33:38 - no one ever says anything
33:41 - all right so let's go
33:43 - first step is
33:47 - let's figure out what content we're
33:48 - going to bring over once we figure that
33:50 - out we gotta figure out um how are we
33:53 - gonna get all the content what fields do
33:55 - we need to bring over we use our
33:57 - migrate.js
33:59 - program
34:00 - to
34:01 - pull the data out of the sql server
34:03 - database and then use the wordpress api
34:05 - to put it into the mysql database
34:08 - once we have it there
34:10 - then we're gonna have to
34:12 - create a graphql query to get the data
34:15 - out
34:16 - and we're gonna need a new page
34:21 - a new
34:22 - react component to put the data in
34:27 - so that's the plan once we have the data
34:29 - in we see what we have then maybe we'll
34:31 - style it a little bit
34:33 - and if you notice as we're going i'm not
34:35 - making these perfect right we're just
34:37 - styling a bit so that they don't look
34:39 - so terrible
34:41 - uh this is kind of on purpose
34:43 - because i'd rather get a just get a
34:46 - bunch of stuff in there be able to show
34:48 - it to other people in my department get
34:49 - some feedback before i do that fine
34:51 - tuning
34:52 - because i i we have a tight deadline and
34:55 - i don't want to waste time so i'm going
34:57 - to try to leave everything really rough
34:58 - at first
35:00 - because if if we have the data there and
35:02 - it doesn't look perfect we can still
35:04 - launch and the site will be a million
35:06 - times better than the current site
35:08 - because it'll be fast it'll be easy to
35:10 - find it'll be very clean and not
35:13 - cluttered we can always fine-tune it
35:15 - later ideally i'd like i'd love it to be
35:17 - perfect before launch but that's just
35:19 - it's not gonna happen it's not
35:21 - reasonable given the amount of time that
35:22 - we have
35:23 - i do have hopefully some interns that
35:26 - are gonna start uh working uh for me
35:30 - in like two weeks or something
35:32 - but i don't really know how soon they're
35:34 - gonna be able to get in and start
35:35 - helping so i can't really rely on that
35:39 - uh to help speed things up
35:41 - i mean maybe best case scenario uh i get
35:44 - all three interns that are considering
35:46 - and they're great and they know what's
35:48 - going on and they can help
35:50 - but i'm i'm not planning on it i'm
35:53 - planning on you know basically me and
35:55 - you all helping
35:57 - doing all the work for the most part
36:01 - um all right let's see okay so let me
36:03 - get something done in these last four
36:05 - minutes here and then i'll go back to
36:06 - the live chat and and do the questions
36:11 - um where's our database
36:14 - ice you know what it'll be better if we
36:16 - go
36:18 - um
36:21 - franciscan if we go to the site itself
36:24 - it'll be way easier to just pick it up
36:26 - than looking through records in a
36:27 - database
36:29 - i want to try to pick out main content
36:31 - sections so so far we have faculty
36:33 - member profiles
36:35 - we have the directories for the
36:38 - different departments
36:40 - and we have all the news stories
36:42 - so i want to try to just pick out what's
36:45 - a section
36:46 - that
36:48 - stands out as a really important section
36:51 - and i'm doing it like this
36:52 - because what if we can't get all the
36:54 - sections into the site before we launch
36:57 - let's make sure we have all the
36:58 - important sections first and if there's
37:00 - stuff that needs to come in after then
37:02 - that's fine i'm not worried about it
37:06 - so
37:08 - let's go to the about
37:10 - employment hr get some information i'm
37:13 - mostly trying to pick up things that
37:14 - would be for prospective students
37:17 - if something is geared towards like
37:19 - current employees or current students
37:21 - i'm not worried about because that
37:23 - essentially shouldn't be on this site
37:25 - anyway we have another internal site
37:26 - that should handle all of that
37:31 - all right
37:32 - curriculum
37:33 - academic departments
37:36 - we haven't brought these over i started
37:38 - to do some work to figure out where this
37:40 - was at in the database
37:42 - i think we should bring these over
37:45 - these are definitely important
37:47 - prospective students will
37:48 - most most likely want to check out our
37:52 - different departments and you know
37:54 - figure out what we teach here
37:56 - so
37:58 - all right so it's under the departments
38:00 - let's let's go here this uh accounting
38:03 - business administration economics
38:07 - okay so departments
38:10 - acc hyphen bus hyphen ec
38:16 - really not liking that that url but
38:20 - uh we'll have to keep that in mind
38:21 - because this is a place that i think uh
38:23 - we do want to try to keep the same urls
38:26 - [Music]
38:27 - there's going to be a limited number of
38:29 - departments so if we have to manually
38:31 - put in and change the slugs on these to
38:34 - make a match i'm okay with that right i
38:36 - definitely didn't want to do it with the
38:38 - 540 some
38:40 - news
38:41 - posts that we brought in yesterday
38:44 - i'm willing to do it for these
38:45 - departments though
38:47 - uh
38:48 - all right so let's see
38:50 - i believe the content that we'll want to
38:53 - keep over anything is this
38:56 - and possibly this
39:02 - these are links all right these are our
39:05 - links elsewhere
39:07 - i'm just making sure there's no toggles
39:09 - here for the content
39:11 - um these are fine these
39:13 - we can recreate this and pull this from
39:15 - faculty profiles if we want
39:19 - um
39:20 - let's see this program accounting these
39:23 - read more things i'm not really worried
39:25 - about
39:26 - about this uh this is
39:31 - i i don't think this is super important
39:34 - to have something like this
39:36 - all right
39:37 - all right so now let's find where this
39:39 - data is
39:41 - so i've done
39:45 - and this is gonna slo let me open up on
39:47 - another screen just in case i don't
39:49 - think there's any private data in this
39:51 - database at least in the part that i've
39:53 - taken out of here but
39:54 - better better safe than sorry so i'm
39:57 - gonna open on my other screen just to
39:59 - make sure that everything's okay
40:02 - uh and if it is then i'll bring it over
40:03 - on this screen and show you
40:05 - what i've done is i've pulled out a lot
40:07 - of the data from that database and i put
40:09 - it into a google sheet
40:13 - so that i can more easily
40:17 - sort the data filter it search for
40:19 - things
40:21 - it's a lot easier for me to do that in a
40:22 - google sheet than it is for me to come
40:24 - up with the correct sql queries
40:26 - so that's why i'm doing it this way
40:29 - it should be in my recent documents
40:32 - i hope
40:39 - all right i believe this is it
40:41 - it's a really huge one so hopefully it
40:43 - doesn't mess anything up
40:45 - all right good
40:47 - this is what we have
40:49 - unfortunately i didn't bring over all
40:51 - the data
40:52 - uh so it once we find what we want we're
40:56 - we're gonna have to
40:57 - try to search for it based on
41:00 - the um the id
41:03 - which is okay we're already set up with
41:04 - a query to do that
41:06 - so i'm going to try to find
41:09 - and let's see
41:12 - let's just start typing in
41:22 - business programs
41:25 - all right so we got that that's
41:27 - definitely not it
41:31 - that's not it
41:34 - oops
41:41 - it might be frozen
41:45 - it is
41:46 - let me refresh the page
41:50 - maybe i should pull this into excel
41:52 - maybe it's just too much strain on a
41:54 - google sheet
42:05 - all right let's exit that page
42:07 - and um
42:09 - let's pull that same data into excel
42:27 - alright
42:49 - uh it's asking me to update it i don't
42:52 - want to update it
42:57 - all right
42:58 - here
43:11 - so excel just opened up really huge on
43:14 - my other screen so i can't see the live
43:16 - chat anymore
43:18 - all right
43:20 - if it says it looks like the sql query
43:22 - might have been easier after all yeah i
43:24 - was thinking the same thing all right so
43:26 - now i have this open in excel
43:29 - and
43:30 - let's do a find
43:32 - are there no keyboard short there we go
43:34 - um
43:39 - business programs
43:59 - there we are
44:01 - got it
44:02 - and
44:08 - ah this is not good
44:11 - not good
44:17 - all right well let's search
44:23 - um
44:25 - 222.
44:28 - um yeah let's search for folder 222. the
44:32 - reason i'm saying this is not good is
44:35 - that
44:40 - this
44:41 - the different content types in folder
44:44 - 222
44:46 - they're they're not all
44:49 - it's not what i wanted
44:51 - but let's just check it out
44:53 - so let me find
44:58 - this is our
45:00 - microsoft sql operations studio
45:03 - let's get
45:07 - i always forget how to do a new query
45:09 - nope
45:29 - how do i do a new query there we are
45:34 - okay
45:35 - um i'm going to need to
45:40 - the easiest way is just going to be to
45:42 - pull this
45:44 - that way i don't have to type it all out
45:46 - again
45:48 - and so let's paste that in and use what
45:51 - i want to see is everything
45:54 - and then we'll uh we'll pair it down to
45:56 - what we just need so we're going to
45:57 - select everything from the folder
45:59 - content or the table content i'm not
46:02 - sure with terminology is where the
46:04 - folder id is 222
46:07 - and i don't want any
46:10 - records where the
46:12 - there's no content
46:14 - all right so that makes sense that's
46:16 - that's a waste we don't want those so
46:18 - let's run that and it's gonna ask me to
46:20 - pick the server and this is the server
46:29 - all right so here's what we're working
46:31 - with i don't really care about these
46:34 - right now
46:36 - um content title and the html are really
46:40 - what i want to see the most
46:45 - sample sample program
46:51 - hmm
47:11 - well
47:15 - this is not as bad as i thought
47:32 - all right actually it's just a little
47:34 - bad
47:36 - um
47:41 - these are just
47:43 - menus
47:53 - all right
48:04 - all right let's think about this for a
48:05 - second before we bring it over let me
48:07 - check my timer it's got to be up i know
48:12 - it is up i must not have heard it okay
48:14 - all right let me
48:16 - let's take a break right now i'm going
48:17 - to go back to the live chat this will
48:18 - give me a second to process
48:20 - you know what with the data we just saw
48:22 - what we're going to do with it
48:24 - uh when i when the timer is up i'm going
48:26 - to explain um
48:28 - why i think this is going to be a little
48:31 - bit of a problem
48:34 - all right so let me scroll up and go
48:37 - down through our chat
48:45 - also we have a major problem
48:49 - all right it's good my spotify wasn't
48:51 - working
48:53 - now it is so we're good
48:57 - let's see
49:06 - all right so the first half of
49:08 - everything in the live chat is just
49:10 - about how the stream was not
49:12 - uh operating properly everything was
49:16 - lagging or stuck
49:38 - uh so blake asks if i've
49:40 - ever done any social media marketing
49:43 - yes i have uh so
49:46 - when i was freelancing uh so this was
49:49 - maybe like two and a half years ago i
49:51 - stopped
49:52 - well i didn't stop freelancing
49:54 - completely but i stopped
49:56 - like actively looking for clients
49:59 - uh
50:00 - i would do social media marketing and
50:02 - pretty much anything else that a small
50:04 - business might want that it had anything
50:06 - to do with the internet
50:08 - so social media marketing was a part of
50:10 - that
50:12 - it's not my
50:14 - i didn't really enjoy social media
50:16 - marketing as much as i enjoyed other
50:18 - things
50:20 - it was
50:21 - i don't know if i want to say it was my
50:23 - least favorite part
50:24 - of what i did but it was definitely low
50:28 - low on the list of things
50:30 - uh that i i like to do it was
50:33 - but
50:34 - if you have any questions blake about
50:36 - social media marketing let me know
50:38 - uh in my department we do a lot of
50:40 - social media marketing i don't handle it
50:42 - directly at all
50:44 - um i have access to our some of our
50:46 - accounts and
50:48 - for like an emergency if several other
50:50 - people in the department are all sick
50:52 - and we can't get a hold of him
50:55 - then i
50:56 - i can do it but
50:58 - that's not really my thing but if i i
51:00 - still know a little bit about it
51:03 - so if you have any questions let me know
51:09 - uh evo says that's the way i like to
51:11 - work
51:12 - as well work out the bass first and
51:14 - start perfecting it afterwards with
51:16 - clients it's usually that they find the
51:18 - bass good enough even though
51:21 - they said they don't
51:22 - yeah yeah that's
51:24 - yeah i've the only problem i've had with
51:26 - that and i still i like to do it i think
51:29 - it's the best is sometimes you go in to
51:31 - show clients or in my case other people
51:33 - that i work with here
51:37 - they're expecting when you go to show
51:39 - them sometimes they're expecting too
51:40 - much
51:41 - and you're just showing them kind of
51:43 - like a concept like first draft type of
51:46 - thing and they they're really
51:47 - disappointed they start asking about all
51:49 - these little details
51:51 - and they kind of miss the point of you
51:53 - know this is a big picture overview just
51:55 - to kind of show you
51:56 - what's possible and what's going on
51:59 - so sometimes they can be disappointed
52:01 - and get stuck
52:02 - um on on some of the little rough
52:05 - details so i i do have to like warn
52:08 - people going into a meeting when i'm
52:10 - going to show them this like hey
52:13 - it's not finished
52:14 - it's just a rough draft like if you see
52:17 - something that's wrong like
52:19 - it's probably gonna be finished you know
52:21 - i still welcome any input but
52:25 - uh i do have to be careful about that
52:28 - i think i walked into a meeting one time
52:30 - and somebody that is higher up where i
52:33 - work
52:34 - um
52:35 - said they hated
52:38 - they hated it they hated my project i
52:40 - think i had sent a link out to it before
52:42 - the meeting
52:43 - and then i found out that they said they
52:45 - hated
52:48 - so at the meeting i was very careful to
52:50 - explain
52:51 - everything
52:53 - uh since i knew going in that
52:56 - uh it wasn't exactly understood that it
52:58 - was a first draft
53:05 - oh rook had to go
53:07 - uh
53:08 - sorry i i missed that you're probably
53:10 - already gone but by anyway i'm sure
53:12 - you'll watch this later on
53:21 - yeah evo says wow that site took really
53:23 - long to load i think that you were
53:25 - talking about this site this main
53:27 - franciscan website yeah that's one of
53:29 - the reasons why i think anything we
53:31 - build will be perceived as better
53:34 - because right now the load times are so
53:36 - so bad
53:38 - i think a lot of people don't even stick
53:39 - around to see the site
53:42 - i'm not going to use as an excuse to
53:45 - slack off i really want to make a good
53:47 - site in its own right but
53:49 - you know we we have that going for us
53:51 - though our site is most definitely going
53:53 - to be
53:54 - way faster uh then this site i want it
53:58 - to be faster than
53:59 - than most sites
54:01 - you know out there certainly any of our
54:03 - competitors other universities i want
54:05 - this to be the fastest site
54:12 - uh philip says is that out of the box uh
54:16 - visual studio code any special extension
54:18 - to get that view
54:19 - um yeah i do have some different
54:21 - extensions so hmm maybe i don't have the
54:25 - sound enabled on this
54:27 - let me refresh and see
54:35 - allow notifications
54:37 - huh
54:39 - all right
54:40 - i keep missing that the timers up
54:43 - uh guys so i do have some things so my
54:46 - theme is seti so it's s-e-t-i that's the
54:49 - theme that i use and i also use a bunch
54:51 - of plugins to handle react type stuff so
54:54 - if you look up
54:57 - react
54:58 - is it react food truck
55:00 - i think that's what it's called react
55:02 - food truck is a plug-in that will
55:04 - automatically download a bunch of other
55:06 - plugins for you that all have to do with
55:08 - making it easier to develop react
55:11 - applications in visual studio code
55:13 - so i checked that out i have very few
55:15 - additions to that setup
55:17 - so if you want your setup to look more
55:20 - like mine
55:21 - then
55:22 - i start with that and then if there's
55:24 - something that still doesn't look the
55:25 - same ask me
55:28 - and i i can kind of look more into my
55:29 - plugins
55:31 - i really can't tell you what i have
55:32 - offhand i'd have to look myself
55:39 - all right let's see
55:42 - oop let me start my timer here
55:46 - all right so
55:50 - oh i'm sorry i just saw this this is
55:52 - really exciting so i'm going to read
55:53 - this comment uh john hanson said quincy
55:56 - is going to put my light bright on free
55:57 - code camp as an extracurricular project
56:00 - cool yeah all right
56:03 - um
56:05 - that's awesome
56:07 - john i'm so happy about that that's
56:09 - really really cool that's going to be a
56:12 - fun project for people to do
56:14 - wow really cool
56:17 - really cool if if you you all haven't
56:19 - seen john's light bright project on uh
56:23 - codepen
56:24 - uh check it out uh if you wanna link
56:28 - check out my my twitter page
56:30 - i i posted um or i i retweeted something
56:34 - from john that has the link to it uh
56:37 - yesterday so it'll be in one of my top
56:39 - my top posts
56:40 - uh check it out there and
56:44 - if you like it give give john some love
56:46 - on codepen and twitter
56:48 - it's it's cool it's really cool
56:55 - all right
56:59 - so let me
57:02 - let's go back to our data you know
57:04 - quickly i'm gonna do with it
57:13 - oh way over here
57:14 - all right let's go back to our data
57:19 - and
57:24 - all right so this is this is what i'm
57:26 - worried about this is my problem so
57:29 - i was hoping that i could get
57:33 - find a folder or something that had all
57:36 - of the main programs
57:38 - in a folder
57:39 - but that's that's not the case what we
57:41 - have is everything that's under like the
57:44 - business department is all here but
57:46 - they're all different types
57:48 - so we these are called quick links which
57:51 - are basically just lists of of links
57:57 - which we may or may not need
57:59 - i'll have to check closer into these
58:01 - links
58:04 - i mean they might not even work with our
58:06 - new structure i'm trying to keep all the
58:08 - urls the same but i don't think we can
58:10 - keep all of them the same
58:13 - um
58:15 - finance classes text
58:18 - i mean and they have text these are all
58:20 - texts for specific sets of classes
58:23 - up here we have all these like programs
58:26 - that are really kind of like sub
58:28 - programs underneath
58:30 - this main header so this is kind of the
58:32 - main thing
58:34 - and then pretty much everything else on
58:37 - here is
58:40 - under that
58:41 - you know it's kind of a sub
58:43 - section of that
58:46 - so it's going to make it a lot more
58:48 - difficult just to pull all this stuff in
58:50 - under one post type
58:56 - all right um
58:59 - vince just asked if i could share the
59:00 - link to the light brite thing yeah on
59:03 - the next uh break the next five minute
59:05 - break i'll i'll find the link and i'll
59:07 - and i'll share it
59:16 - all right
59:19 - let me i'm gonna go over here and see if
59:21 - there's
59:22 - anything that might
59:24 - differentiate any of this stuff
59:30 - hmm
59:42 - looks like these teasers are going to be
59:44 - pretty worthless
59:47 - so some of them are
59:50 - some of them might be okay
60:00 - hmm
60:20 - hmm
60:24 - all right
60:25 - well it looks like
60:27 - we could get at the very least
60:30 - the text for these different programs
60:33 - and i think that that will be worthwhile
60:44 - let's double check here
60:50 - so from this main academics page
60:54 - these are all the departments listed
61:00 - and then these underneath here listed as
61:02 - majors
61:11 - all right let's see what
61:13 - what the url structure is like for one
61:15 - of these
61:16 - oh
61:18 - it's just accounting there's not even
61:21 - anything
61:22 - in between
61:28 - let's verify that it's the same
61:35 - oh
61:36 - this is not this is not good
61:45 - not good not good
61:52 - i'm
62:10 - i mean
62:11 - where are we gonna find this
62:43 - this is going to take a lot more manual
62:45 - work
62:47 - um
62:54 - all right cool vince found the link
62:56 - uh so
62:57 - uh awesome
63:01 - wow all right let's grab
63:07 - i guess some different content
63:14 - because this is just not
63:20 - this is not going to work out
63:27 - i wonder if there's consistency
63:30 - departments nursing okay
63:41 - and now they have the major that's
63:43 - nursing
64:08 - all right maybe i should just go we'll
64:10 - get some data from somewhere else
64:12 - because this is a mess
64:30 - all right
64:32 - thanks get that mix
64:34 - all right let's check academics
64:47 - well we looked at academic departments
64:49 - already
65:11 - so this is where all those majors pages
65:15 - were
65:21 - all right
65:23 - all right so let's so we we basically
65:25 - have two
65:28 - we have two different listings that have
65:30 - a lot of the same information
65:32 - uh so
65:34 - all the majors that a student can take
65:36 - are listed on this page here
65:39 - then there's the other page that we just
65:41 - came from the list academic departments
65:44 - so these majors are grouped into
65:46 - different departments
65:49 - but for some reason
65:52 - the urls on these
65:55 - which should say franciscan.edu slash
65:57 - majors and then slash whatever the major
66:00 - is
66:01 - don't it just franciscan.edu
66:05 - and then whatever the major is and that
66:07 - makes it a little bit
66:08 - weird
66:24 - and it's
66:25 - the all the other thing that makes this
66:28 - tough is
66:32 - within the same folders which is really
66:34 - the only reliable way that we found to
66:37 - uh to pull in data like all of a certain
66:39 - type so within the folders it includes
66:43 - both the pages for majors and the pages
66:46 - and content for departments as well as
66:48 - some other stuff
66:49 - all right so here's what i'm thinking
66:51 - what if
66:52 - um
66:54 - we made a content type to house both
66:57 - programs and majors within that content
67:01 - type
67:02 - we had a category set up and we had a
67:06 - category for
67:08 - a program and a category for major
67:12 - so that when we go to grab that data
67:16 - for our
67:17 - our app
67:19 - we could sort it out
67:25 - yeah we're gonna we basically we could
67:27 - sort those out so that we can just grab
67:30 - all the programs or we could just grab
67:32 - all the
67:34 - majors
67:38 - maybe we'll need to have
67:43 - i think we're gonna have to have two
67:44 - taxonomies so we're gonna need some set
67:47 - of like
67:49 - categories but then also
67:53 - maybe tags that go along with the name
67:56 - of
67:57 - a program
67:58 - because we're going to need to be able
67:59 - to bring in program info or links to
68:02 - programs within those
68:05 - all right so we don't have to decide
68:07 - that yet first thing we have to do is
68:09 - bring the data over unfortunately we're
68:11 - going to have to manually check
68:14 - and say which ones are majors and which
68:16 - ones are programs
68:18 - because there's no
68:20 - reliable data it seems
68:23 - that we could pull that
68:26 - and do it pro programmatically
68:30 - so let's test it by first bringing in
68:32 - this folder 222 that we found
68:36 - let's bring in 222
68:38 - see what we have
68:40 - categorize what we need to and then get
68:43 - rid of what we need to
68:45 - uh that'll give us an idea of how long
68:47 - it will take per folder and then we can
68:49 - figure
68:50 - you know hey is this worth it is this
68:52 - not worth it
68:54 - all right that's the plan
68:57 - that's the plan for now
69:01 - all right so let's go to our migrate.js
69:05 - program here let me make the
69:10 - font size larger
69:12 - and we're going to go to 222
69:15 - that's what we want we don't need date
69:18 - created
69:19 - i am going to keep content
69:25 - uh i'm going to keep the content teaser
69:29 - some of the teasers are
69:31 - nonsense
69:33 - they're not actually even real sentences
69:35 - but some of them do look like they'd be
69:36 - useful so we're going to keep them we
69:38 - want the content we want the title
69:41 - content id
69:43 - all right good
69:44 - so we have that
69:47 - let's go through and see
69:49 - all right content title we're replacing
69:52 - that that's going to be the slug
69:56 - for now that's ok
70:00 - no we don't need to do that uh we we um
70:07 - yeah we determined yesterday that we
70:10 - for
70:10 - for these and for some things we don't
70:13 - need to
70:15 - change
70:16 - the title before we put it in as the
70:19 - slug right and in fact we don't even
70:22 - need to add a slug it will be
70:24 - automatically added
70:29 - all right so let's do this so we don't
70:30 - have to
70:31 - worry about that at all
70:34 - it really wouldn't matter either way
70:36 - but
70:37 - we'll let wordpress handle how to
70:38 - manipulate those slugs we're probably
70:40 - gonna have to manually change the slugs
70:42 - anyway
70:47 - um let me check my time here since all
70:50 - right about 10 minutes in about 10
70:52 - minutes let me go back to the live chat
70:53 - i see there's more questions in there
70:55 - and i definitely want to get to them um
70:58 - all right we don't want the date anymore
71:02 - we are going to bring in the excerpts
71:05 - this is published title content all
71:07 - right great this is what we want
71:11 - we need to change
71:12 - the
71:17 - we need to change the name somewhere
71:19 - right
71:24 - where do i have it
71:35 - let's
71:37 - i don't want that
71:38 - right now
72:00 - why can i not find the place where i
72:02 - need there we are there it is
72:06 - all right so what are we going to call
72:07 - this post type um
72:19 - i i guess we're going to call it majors
72:21 - and departments
72:30 - i'm going to call it majors for now
72:37 - i'm going to call it majors
72:40 - it wouldn't be that much work to
72:42 - manually take a lot of the data out and
72:44 - maybe make another post type for
72:46 - departments
72:48 - and that might be something that i could
72:50 - get um someone else to do
72:54 - all right let's do that so we're gonna
72:55 - call this majors
72:59 - now we have to make a post type for that
73:01 - so let's really quickly copy and paste
73:04 - make a post type
73:08 - let's see
73:18 - so let's copy what we did yesterday
73:23 - and
73:24 - make
73:26 - majors
73:28 - so
73:33 - uh
73:34 - let's not copy that because we had
73:36 - everything
73:37 - uh singular and plural exactly the same
73:40 - this one would be better
73:58 - this
74:04 - all right so that's major
74:06 - and then all the plural
74:09 - we'll call majors
74:14 - and then down here we'll do the same
74:28 - all right so this is a bit of php this
74:30 - is a wordpress plugin
74:33 - so all we're doing here is making a new
74:36 - custom post type
74:38 - we're giving it some labels that will
74:39 - appear in the admin panel and then we're
74:42 - also just kind of telling it how it
74:44 - should act uh the type of fields that it
74:46 - should have available for users to edit
74:49 - and uh where it should appear we want to
74:52 - make sure it does appear in graphql
74:56 - so that it we're able to grab that data
74:58 - from graphql we're also telling it to
75:01 - appear in the rest api which
75:03 - right now we're using a little bit just
75:05 - to get
75:06 - a visual of what the data looks like but
75:09 - may not need that
75:11 - when we actually
75:13 - launch the site
75:16 - and
75:18 - all right
75:19 - so let's save that
75:21 - i'm going to copy it and let's go to our
75:24 - our wordpress installation
75:28 - login
75:31 - and go to our plugins and edit our
75:34 - plugins this isn't the only way we could
75:35 - edit the plugin but
75:37 - i haven't really set up any other way so
75:40 - this is how we're going to do it for
75:42 - right now oops it's the wrong plugin
75:44 - here's our custom plugin
75:47 - all right
75:49 - so we're going to paste the new stuff
75:51 - update if we have an error it should
75:52 - tell us automatically and so it doesn't
75:55 - have an error
75:56 - we do have this warning making changes
75:58 - active plugins is not recommended
76:01 - so
76:02 - we just did nothing broke
76:05 - this isn't really a live site on a live
76:07 - site
76:09 - probably wouldn't do that
76:12 - so now that that's there we should be
76:14 - able to
76:15 - run our migrate.js
76:18 - program and
76:20 - everything should migrate over
76:23 - yesterday i made some mistakes this
76:24 - doesn't work on the first try so
76:27 - we'll see
76:28 - see if i
76:29 - forgot anything this time
76:34 - um
76:36 - uh
76:37 - let's go
76:39 - node
76:42 - my grade.js
76:47 - yay
76:50 - cool it worked
76:52 - well i didn't realize there were that
76:53 - many in there
76:57 - all right cool we'll shut this program
76:59 - down
77:00 - uh remember we did it we do control c
77:03 - and that shut that down
77:05 - and now we can check our wordpress
77:07 - installation
77:09 - and what we should have
77:12 - is a place for majors and if we click on
77:15 - there
77:18 - hmm
77:23 - nothing's in there what happened
77:28 - let's double check our
77:30 - migrate.js file
77:40 - well it said it was inserted but it
77:42 - obviously was not
77:55 - um
78:05 - maybe
78:06 - it's not supposed to be plural
78:08 - let's give that another shot
78:19 - there we are okay this so the problem
78:21 - was um
78:24 - i supposed to use the singular major
78:26 - instead of the plural majors
78:30 - um
78:35 - all right
78:37 - all right two more minutes i'm gonna get
78:39 - to the live chat answer some questions
78:43 - let's see what we have
78:45 - header
78:50 - yeah i don't i don't really want
78:52 - that right do you really want the header
79:05 - i don't know
79:11 - maybe it would be useful
79:14 - better right now to not delete
79:17 - if we don't
79:18 - have to i am interested to see what
79:20 - these
79:23 - quick links are
79:29 - all right so these are our relative
79:32 - links which
79:34 - that's
79:35 - that's good
79:37 - some of these are links to our
79:40 - uh we have a
79:42 - an outside
79:43 - like a third-party vendor that um
79:48 - called smart catalog that handles all of
79:50 - our our course descriptions and things
79:53 - so those links will still work
80:17 - all right it looks like these links will
80:18 - still work
80:26 - so
80:27 - maybe
80:27 - maybe we'll use them
80:37 - oops and the time's almost up
80:42 - so
80:43 - let's
80:45 - well well we'll see what time it is
80:49 - all right let me go to live chat we'll
80:50 - answer some questions uh while i'm
80:52 - answering the questions let me know if
80:54 - you want to continue on now and build
80:56 - out a page
80:57 - to put some of this data on
80:59 - i'm thinking what we might have to do is
81:01 - grab multiple
81:04 - pieces from here to build out the page
81:11 - um
81:14 - yeah we're going to have to build this
81:16 - differently than we built any of the
81:18 - other pages
81:19 - uh i think if we want to avoid having to
81:23 - like hand code anything or make
81:28 - yeah it'll be a little bit more work
81:31 - coming in but then i think it should
81:34 - make things go faster as we bring in the
81:36 - other folders for this so let's
81:39 - let's give it a shot but let me know if
81:40 - you'd rather wait and do that on a
81:42 - different stream and we've already been
81:44 - streaming it's about an hour and a half
81:46 - so
81:47 - it's gonna end up being really long i
81:49 - know it's getting late for some of you
81:50 - so anyway
81:53 - please put in the live chat now if you
81:55 - think we should just save this for
81:56 - tomorrow's stream or if we should keep
81:58 - going today
82:00 - um
82:02 - i i could do other one i'm okay with
82:04 - either one
82:06 - all right so let me go back up to where
82:08 - i left off and
82:10 - get these questions answered
82:13 - oops i'm going to do the short break but
82:15 - if i have to go over i'm fine with that
82:17 - i want to get these questions in
82:38 - oh evo says i have my first non-intern
82:41 - job interview next monday and i'm really
82:43 - stoked
82:44 - i am too
82:46 - that's really exciting
82:48 - um
82:49 - i don't know how many um like the
82:50 - details that you could give of that on
82:52 - the live stream but i'd i'd love to hear
82:54 - more details about like what's what's
82:56 - the job you know like uh and i give you
83:00 - know any help
83:02 - i'm happy to give it i um
83:05 - i've i've obviously interviewed before
83:09 - four jobs but i've also been on the
83:10 - other end interviewing developers so
83:13 - i don't know maybe i could be able to
83:15 - give you some advice
83:17 - if you want right i'm no expert i'm just
83:20 - happy for you and when i hope you get
83:21 - the job so
83:23 - i don't know how helpful i'd be but
83:25 - that's really cool definitely so when
83:27 - it's next monday all right
83:29 - you
83:30 - you have to if you get a chance uh after
83:32 - the interview uh come back in the live
83:34 - chat let us know how it went
83:38 - uh i'm gonna be waiting to hear
83:40 - uh if you can't make it to the live chat
83:42 - like let me know on twitter or something
83:48 - uh let's see
83:52 - vince says
83:53 - that's not regular html
83:56 - um
83:56 - the element not in the head and what is
84:00 - yeah
84:01 - there's weird stuff going on with this
84:02 - html uh harshit said that's the beauty
84:05 - of ektron yeah definitely
84:07 - um
84:09 - yeah this html is weird
84:12 - it's
84:13 - if we could see
84:16 - where's the business program yeah we
84:18 - should be able to see some of the
84:19 - weirdness going on here
84:21 - uh
84:23 - whoa this one's not too bad
84:25 - these are normal p tags
84:27 - you gotta be kidding me
84:29 - hey we finally got something with some
84:31 - good markup all right but but you're
84:33 - right we have been getting some weird
84:34 - markup we've had to do some weird stuff
84:36 - with data
84:38 - earlier like um
84:40 - changing the names of some of the tags
84:43 - with javascript in our components
84:46 - before we render anything
84:49 - using css to just hide stuff that's just
84:53 - weird and shouldn't be there so
84:56 - we we have to work with this now the
84:58 - plan long term
85:00 - is to clean all that up have separate
85:03 - fields in wordpress in our our post
85:06 - types
85:07 - for each piece of data and then to pull
85:09 - that in and
85:11 - it'll be so much nicer once we get that
85:14 - there'll be no need for anyone who deals
85:16 - with the data
85:17 - to really know html
85:21 - so
85:23 - it'll be all right but we're doing it
85:24 - this way to save time
85:28 - uh i i wish we had more people
85:31 - you know that that worked in my
85:32 - department that could do some of this
85:35 - you know i could bring it in set up the
85:36 - post type and then they could just work
85:38 - on data entry basically
85:40 - but we just don't have that right now
85:42 - especially like the students are still
85:44 - on on their break for christmas and
85:48 - so we don't we don't even have student
85:49 - workers really uh to work on this
86:00 - uh ego says uh and this is in regard to
86:03 - when i was saying that the current
86:04 - website's really slow so the new website
86:08 - anything should be an improvement so he
86:09 - said yeah if the previous was really bad
86:11 - then everything will be perceived as a
86:12 - huge improvement
86:14 - it will yeah but
86:15 - not by everyone
86:17 - there's a group of people at the
86:19 - university mostly faculty members that
86:23 - see any type of change is a bad thing
86:25 - especially if it's a change in
86:27 - technology so i'm sure that we'll have
86:29 - some complaints
86:31 - when it comes to that but
86:33 - this site's not for an internal audience
86:35 - it's for an external audience so
86:37 - if anybody internally complains about it
86:39 - i'll just remind them that well that's
86:42 - that you're not really the audience the
86:44 - audience are
86:46 - high school students mainly
86:48 - so
86:49 - that's what we have to keep in mind is
86:51 - would a high school student look at this
86:53 - know what to do be attracted uh to this
86:57 - so
86:59 - hopefully they will be
87:04 - i'm sure they'll appreciate
87:06 - the increase in speed
87:11 - uh sj says normally never catch this
87:14 - live usually watch the recordings the
87:16 - next day sj i'm i'm really happy you got
87:19 - to catch this live uh welcome welcome to
87:21 - the live chat and uh thank thanks for
87:24 - watching
87:26 - um let's see
87:28 - uh sj says uh wanted to let you know
87:33 - yesterday when you had the weird slug it
87:35 - was because you highlighted the hyphen
87:38 - from the beginning of the slug and
87:40 - physically dragged it to the end of the
87:41 - slug oh no
87:45 - and i didn't even know i didn't catch
87:47 - that well thank you sj for bringing it
87:49 - up because i had no idea
87:51 - why it happened and then why it was
87:53 - fixed so it must have just
87:56 - um
87:57 - maybe automatically been fixed because i
87:59 - didn't save it
88:00 - and then when i went to a different post
88:02 - it just reverted
88:04 - that's probably what happened so wow
88:08 - good catch on that that must have been
88:11 - that's a small detail but i really
88:13 - appreciate you coming in the live chat
88:15 - and and telling me now i'm not going to
88:17 - be worried about
88:18 - bringing in the slugs and stuff that you
88:20 - know because that was you know entirely
88:23 - my fault
88:25 - all right cool
88:27 - believe i made it silly mistake and
88:29 - didn't notice it like that but i really
88:31 - appreciate you saying that
88:32 - um
88:34 - vince says
88:41 - and says ello you mean i don't have to
88:43 - worry about running out of the black
88:45 - pieces of paper with the patterns on
88:48 - them
88:50 - i don't remember what i said
88:53 - i don't i don't remember what i said for
88:55 - that
88:56 - response so uh vince let me know what i
88:59 - was talking about
89:03 - let's see
89:09 - uh vince says i'm new here oh no you're
89:13 - talking about light bright that's it
89:14 - okay
89:16 - took me a little while to figure out
89:17 - what's going on so yeah if anybody
89:19 - actually used light bright when you were
89:21 - a kid
89:22 - you remember like you had the so you had
89:24 - the the box right and there was a light
89:27 - bulb literally a light bulb in that box
89:29 - and then this black
89:31 - um piece of plastic with all the holes
89:33 - in it
89:34 - and then you would take a black piece of
89:37 - paper that had a pattern on it and it i
89:39 - think it had little letters to let you
89:41 - know what color to put in there and you
89:43 - stuck that on the grid
89:45 - and then you pushed little plastic uh
89:48 - pegs in there
89:49 - and the light would shine
89:51 - and the plastic was like
89:54 - semi-transparent right so you'd push the
89:56 - pegs in there and it would shine with
89:58 - all these different colors right but if
90:00 - you use the paper once
90:03 - it's done for basically because you're
90:05 - not going to remember all the colors and
90:07 - everything
90:08 - um
90:09 - but anyway so that's that's how light
90:11 - bright worked if you're not familiar
90:12 - with light bright but john's version
90:16 - uh done in reacts um on codepen
90:21 - is entirely reusable it's awesome
90:31 - let's see
90:32 - uh guitar
90:34 - 6029 says hello would you say react is
90:37 - more popular than angular
90:41 - yeah that's a big debate uh i can only
90:43 - give you my personal opinion i don't
90:45 - really know numbers for sure you know
90:47 - but
90:50 - i'll say this react is for sure growing
90:53 - in popularity at a faster rate than
90:55 - angular is
90:57 - i see
90:59 - like just looking at job i look at job
91:01 - postings a lot uh i think it's a great
91:03 - way to try to keep your skills in line
91:05 - with what companies really want
91:09 - a lot of like bigger comp it's this is
91:11 - just my perception from what i've seen
91:13 - so
91:14 - just you know realize that it this is
91:16 - just me talking here
91:18 - the bigger companies that switched to
91:20 - angular when angular was a big deal like
91:22 - i don't know let's say like five six
91:24 - years ago or something
91:25 - um
91:28 - you know they made the switch to angular
91:30 - that takes a lot of work to make the
91:31 - switch they're not really as quick to
91:33 - switch
91:34 - to react now
91:36 - smaller companies
91:38 - seem to be switching to react like
91:40 - obviously newer companies are seem to
91:42 - all be going with react uh all your
91:44 - startups and stuff and then smaller
91:46 - companies that maybe either didn't do
91:49 - angular
91:50 - are now doing react or maybe if they're
91:52 - just more open
91:54 - they don't have a huge code base and
91:55 - they're more open to switching it over
91:57 - it seems like they're going with with
91:59 - react more
92:00 - that's just my observation from
92:03 - from job listings right but
92:06 - um i don't really know of any like
92:08 - specific numbers just to like well how
92:10 - many sites use angular versus reactor
92:13 - how many companies use it so i'm not
92:15 - sure
92:16 - uh if i had to pick one that
92:18 - that has more momentum
92:21 - i i'd put my money on react for sure
92:25 - it just seems like
92:27 - you see so much more about react out
92:29 - there uh being talked about
92:32 - on twitter
92:33 - um you know in in
92:36 - blogs and stuff so it's not like react
92:38 - is out or angular's out of the picture
92:40 - you know it's definitely not it's a big
92:42 - player a lot of people use angular
92:44 - but reacts just got a lot of momentum
92:47 - right now and it has for a couple years
92:49 - now
92:52 - anyway hopefully that's a good answer um
92:55 - i'm not i i'm a big believer in and say
92:59 - the idea that there's a lot of different
93:01 - ways to solve a problem
93:03 - and you know not not one one way isn't
93:06 - the way to solve every single problem so
93:08 - for me react is helping me solve a lot
93:11 - of problems right now
93:13 - um
93:14 - but
93:16 - it totally fine with using other tools
93:18 - other solutions
93:20 - or if other people look at the same
93:21 - problem use a different solution it's
93:23 - fine with me at the end of the day if
93:25 - you fulfill all the user stories
93:27 - all the requirements for the project
93:30 - and
93:30 - you know you've really
93:32 - designed something that provides a great
93:34 - user experience
93:37 - doesn't really matter what you used
93:38 - right
93:40 - it doesn't matter as long as you you
93:41 - don't want good code
93:43 - then that's
93:45 - that's fine everything else is cool to
93:47 - debate
93:48 - but from a user's point of view it
93:50 - doesn't matter at all and usually from a
93:52 - client's point of view it doesn't matter
93:54 - at all
93:57 - so don't feel bad no matter what you're
93:59 - using as long as you're producing good
94:01 - work
94:03 - i i mean
94:04 - you're where you need to be right if
94:06 - you're out looking for a job and you
94:08 - need to know like who's hiring what
94:10 - skills do i need that's a different
94:11 - story
94:13 - um but if you're already making money
94:15 - and doing good work
94:17 - then you know i'd say don't don't worry
94:19 - about what the next best thing is
94:25 - um
94:26 - let's see
94:30 - philip says
94:32 - i'll say javascript is the most popular
94:35 - yeah
94:37 - yeah
94:38 - guitar says everyone is jumping on
94:40 - frameworks but never learning javascript
94:43 - um yeah i would say um
94:48 - there's some truth to that
94:50 - uh i i see that
94:52 - that's sent that statement kind of
94:54 - repeated um in a lot of different places
94:57 - so i i agree
94:59 - my my take on this is
95:03 - when you're first starting out yes learn
95:05 - your basics of javascript right
95:08 - but you shouldn't
95:10 - try to master
95:12 - javascript before you go into a
95:14 - framework
95:15 - uh here's why
95:18 - assuming that you're trying to make
95:19 - money while you're doing this and you're
95:20 - not a full-time student that can afford
95:22 - to just take your time
95:25 - you're gonna miss out on a lot of money
95:28 - if you force yourself to just use
95:30 - javascript uh and don't jump in on um
95:34 - some type of framework
95:36 - and just because you go to a framework
95:38 - doesn't mean you stop learning
95:39 - javascript
95:41 - my
95:42 - path if i was going to give advice
95:45 - as to a path to take is learn your basic
95:47 - javascript
95:49 - enough to be able to understand what's
95:50 - going on in the framework
95:53 - then start learning the framework but
95:55 - also keep learning javascript at the
95:57 - same time then you'll get the best of
95:58 - both worlds then you'll get to learn the
96:00 - framework you'll start working on
96:02 - projects like that if it's an in-demand
96:04 - framework you could probably get a job
96:06 - or start making money at least freelance
96:08 - with it
96:09 - and you keep building up your javascript
96:11 - skills
96:12 - i learned a lot of new es6 stuff when i
96:16 - switched to react because it was being
96:17 - used in react there's a lot of things
96:19 - that i never had to do a lot of
96:21 - javascript stuff i never had to use
96:23 - until i started using react
96:26 - uh so switching to react actually helped
96:29 - me and pushed me to learn more
96:31 - javascript
96:33 - uh so
96:34 - i think that's it's good to keep in mind
96:36 - that it's not like either or
96:39 - right you can do both at the same time
96:41 - if you know if you do it right you can
96:43 - do both at the same time
96:46 - so that's my official advice um but yeah
96:49 - i mean i agree someone shouldn't just
96:51 - start out day one with react right day
96:54 - one you start out should be plain
96:56 - javascript stuff
96:57 - um
96:59 - for sure you need some foundation
97:02 - uh but just don't feel like you need to
97:04 - wait you know for a really long time
97:07 - before you switch
97:09 - it's it's not going to hurt your skills
97:11 - you can keep on learning
97:13 - uh javascript and a framework and
97:15 - whatever else you want at the same time
97:20 - so i mean that's my opinion based on my
97:22 - experience so i'm not going to hate on
97:24 - anybody that has a different opinion
97:28 - all right let's see john hanson says
97:30 - doesn't graphql allow you to make better
97:32 - queries that pull only the data you need
97:34 - even if categorized in many folders to
97:36 - use it's supposed to work better than
97:38 - just rest api yes yeah for sure
97:41 - um yeah graph graphql will let us grab
97:45 - exactly the data that we want
97:48 - and
97:49 - that's what we'll end up
97:51 - i think we'll end up having a lot of
97:53 - really detailed queries for some of
97:55 - these pages where we need to grab a lot
97:57 - of different you know parts of
98:00 - pieces of of data so
98:02 - we'll have to figure that we're going to
98:04 - have to learn more about
98:06 - querying with graphql as as we go on
98:10 - um and as some of you already know a lot
98:11 - about it i'm for sure going to have to
98:13 - learn more though
98:16 - um vince says how do you bill for a job
98:18 - like this it looks like they gave you a
98:19 - password to their database with very
98:21 - little information about the database
98:22 - architecture is it hourly all right so
98:26 - uh i'm on a salary so i am a full-time
98:29 - friend and developer for university and
98:31 - i'm on a salary so
98:33 - i'm not billing for this
98:35 - if i was doing this freelance
98:38 - hourly would probably be the way to go
98:41 - if i were to give like a lump sum here's
98:43 - how long how much the project it would
98:45 - be huge it would be a big amount because
98:47 - of the amount of like
98:50 - just not knowing right so the reason i
98:52 - don't know anything about this database
98:54 - structure is because no one here knows
98:56 - anything about the database structure
98:58 - the site was
99:00 - was built by a company that we hired
99:04 - to build it
99:06 - and
99:07 - so so we don't know there was really
99:09 - only one person ever maintaining
99:12 - anything on the back end
99:14 - who
99:14 - they don't work here anymore and they
99:17 - didn't use any type of version control
99:19 - for us to be able to go back and see
99:21 - like you know what happened here so
99:25 - if you look back on the stream
99:27 - um
99:28 - we've kind of looked at the back end of
99:30 - this thing we've looked at the database
99:32 - we've tried to figure out what's going
99:33 - on even into like some of the templates
99:35 - that were used
99:37 - it's all detective work right now we're
99:38 - all like always just searching like how
99:41 - is this going on so yeah it's it's a
99:44 - little bit frustrating that we have to
99:46 - spend so much time just trying to figure
99:48 - out where this data is and
99:50 - how it was categorized and things like
99:52 - that but
99:55 - i mean that's that's the job that's what
99:56 - we have to do
99:58 - um so
99:59 - that's why i really want to put thought
100:01 - into how we're pulling this data in
100:03 - because i don't want the next person to
100:05 - have to deal with the same problem right
100:08 - i want to have some logic
100:10 - to the way we structure things
100:13 - and then
100:15 - that you know this will never have to
100:17 - happen again
100:22 - uh vince says in the description it says
100:24 - front end developer at work but there's
100:25 - an awful lot of back end stuff going on
100:27 - here i know it can't be avoided but
100:28 - avoiding this is the reason i want to do
100:30 - front end
100:31 - um
100:33 - yeah vince i i agree to so when i first
100:35 - started doing this stream about i don't
100:37 - know eight eight nine months ago
100:39 - something like that i really did do more
100:42 - front end
100:43 - uh my title is front end developer
100:46 - realistically i've started doing a lot
100:48 - more back end stuff as the year has gone
100:51 - on
100:52 - um
100:55 - you know potentially depending on the
100:57 - company i
100:59 - i maybe could be considered full stack
101:01 - it just depends on
101:03 - you know how titles are in this industry
101:05 - like they're kind of loose and they're
101:06 - not really heavily regulated right you
101:09 - know any industry that has you know
101:11 - javascript ninja as a title you know
101:13 - like
101:15 - titles don't mean that much so
101:18 - maybe it would be worth
101:20 - changing up the description on the video
101:22 - a bit
101:23 - to reflect the fact that we don't just
101:25 - do front-end work
101:27 - you know
101:28 - sometimes you know we
101:30 - get really into back end work and there
101:32 - are some streams where it's just back
101:34 - end we don't do any front end so
101:36 - um
101:38 - that's a good point actually uh that's
101:40 - that's a really good point i think i
101:43 - can't do anything about my title
101:45 - um but i can definitely change the
101:47 - description to more accurately reflect
101:49 - the work that we do on the stream
101:54 - um
101:57 - let's see
102:00 - evo says currently my third year of
102:02 - school but my capacities are hardly
102:03 - reached at school so i decided to seek a
102:05 - development job
102:06 - cool um evo says the job is at a
102:09 - communication company whose campaign who
102:12 - campaigns for multinationals my task
102:15 - will either be
102:17 - back end or front end with angular
102:20 - i will hear the details next monday
102:24 - all right very cool very cool i hope it
102:27 - works out for you
102:29 - and then you'll know angular you you'll
102:31 - be like my my person that knows angular
102:34 - on the stream so if we have to work with
102:36 - that i i can ask you all the angular
102:38 - questions
102:42 - let's see
102:43 - um alexi says
102:45 - are you okay you look kind of tired
102:48 - i feel kind of tired
102:51 - i feel tired i had um
102:54 - i mean i guess i went to sleep at an
102:56 - okay hour
102:58 - but
102:58 - um my um
103:00 - my youngest son was up last night and so
103:04 - i had to get up and um
103:07 - uh get him a drink or something yeah i
103:10 - think he did he wanted to drink and he
103:12 - just wouldn't quit crying without a
103:13 - drink it was like he's really cute but
103:17 - at in the middle of the night like
103:19 - you're just so tired so i i got up and
103:21 - got him a drink he went back to sleep so
103:24 - kind of had interrupted sleep
103:26 - so maybe that's why i'm tired i didn't
103:29 - have as much caffeine as i normally do
103:30 - today too so that could be it so i
103:33 - apologize
103:34 - um i had like an energy drink before the
103:37 - stream because i know it's no fun for
103:39 - you all if i seem like really tired and
103:42 - depressed during the stream so i try to
103:44 - stay upbeat but
103:46 - uh i think i'm okay like i'm not
103:50 - um
103:52 - my eyes feel tired but otherwise my
103:54 - body's like okay
103:59 - thanks for asking though i appreciate
104:01 - the concern
104:04 - uh evo says the only thing i am
104:08 - currently struggling with are questions
104:10 - for my interview but i guess that is
104:12 - just due to lack of understanding as to
104:13 - how they go
104:15 - to work on projects
104:17 - yeah um do you know at all evo if
104:19 - they're gonna ask you like technical
104:20 - questions like algorithms and stuff to
104:23 - solve because there are some websites
104:25 - that are that help you to practice for
104:27 - that kind of thing
104:29 - um so yeah i mean you they may not have
104:31 - told you ahead of time but
104:33 - i can
104:35 - i could give you some links or something
104:37 - to websites that will help with that
104:42 - uh vince says that's how real life
104:44 - worked back in the day
104:46 - light behind the black piece of paper
104:47 - and you poke holes in the color effect
104:49 - yeah yes
104:51 - vince don't worry about i i played with
104:53 - light bright back in the day that's how
104:55 - i totally remember that
104:57 - i love light bright they look so cool
105:01 - did they still sell those
105:04 - i don't know i think
105:06 - maybe i'll
105:07 - i want to get it for my kids but my
105:09 - daughter cordelia is like a year and a
105:11 - half old and i'm i
105:13 - she would definitely try to eat it she
105:15 - would try to eat the little pegs
105:17 - uh and if not eating it she would just
105:19 - throw them around so we'd probably lose
105:21 - the pegs maybe i'll wait until she's a
105:23 - little bit older
105:25 - because otherwise we would just lose all
105:27 - the colored pegs in a week
105:31 - um
105:32 - rumble bros says i'm having a hard time
105:36 - between going full stack
105:38 - or becoming a back end developer only i
105:41 - know doing full stack beads
105:46 - sorry
105:48 - i know doing full stack means i'll have
105:50 - more chances but specialization is also
105:52 - a good thing
105:53 - um
105:54 - rumble bros i'd say um
105:58 - think about
106:00 - if if you don't
106:02 - i'd say this if you're okay financially
106:05 - and can wait a little bit
106:06 - before like getting a good uh dev job
106:10 - then
106:11 - do what you really like to do the most
106:13 - if you really like back end and you
106:15 - don't care for front end stuff stick
106:16 - with back end and specialize get really
106:18 - good at that
106:19 - um
106:20 - if you really need a job and you think
106:22 - going full stack will will give you a
106:25 - better chance of getting a better job
106:27 - maybe making more money
106:28 - then go with that uh you can always you
106:31 - know maybe get to a point later on where
106:33 - you know you have a job you've been
106:34 - there for a year or two
106:36 - and you're comfortable financially and
106:38 - then you can start looking around
106:41 - for a job that you know you something
106:42 - you really want to do
106:44 - um i'm
106:46 - i don't know my my dad always told me
106:49 - you know you just sometimes you just
106:51 - have to get a job it doesn't matter if
106:52 - you like it or not he would say if it
106:54 - was fun they wouldn't call it work so i
106:56 - still have that in me a little bit
106:58 - that's like sometimes you just have to
107:00 - do what you have to do to pay the bills
107:02 - um
107:03 - so
107:05 - i always keep that in mind just kind of
107:06 - be really practical and realistic about
107:08 - that
107:10 - you know do that but then keep working
107:13 - towards your goal of what you really
107:14 - want to do
107:16 - so i don't know if that really helps you
107:19 - you know in terms of an answer but
107:21 - i mean
107:22 - i do know that
107:24 - jobs for full stack developers usually
107:28 - pay more
107:29 - than for front end or back end
107:33 - so
107:34 - if if you're really looking for for an
107:36 - increase in pay or something full stack
107:38 - is probably where you want to go
107:40 - um but it may not be worth it if you
107:42 - really don't like doing the front end
107:43 - stuff
107:46 - all right sj says i've never heard of
107:49 - light bright does that mean i'm young
107:51 - um
107:53 - blake's never heard of it either
107:55 - oh man no you
107:57 - you all never heard of light bright
108:00 - we we have to we have to do something
108:02 - about that
108:06 - we need light bright
108:10 - um
108:16 - let's see if we can get the library
108:17 - commercial
108:34 - all right here's light bright
108:38 - you're not going to be able to hear the
108:39 - sound
108:44 - but this is the original 1970s light
108:47 - break commercial
108:53 - now i mean i i wasn't around in the
108:55 - 1970s i remember using light bright in
108:57 - the late 80s early 90s
109:00 - but that's
109:01 - that's late right
109:13 - and now i'll have to go in and
109:17 - uh
109:18 - check so the the free code camp youtube
109:20 - channel history will now have the
109:21 - library thing in there
109:25 - um
109:26 - let's see
109:29 - so if you've never used light bright go
109:31 - check out john's uh version of light
109:34 - bright and use it
109:36 - and then if you really really like it
109:39 - you could probably find a light bright
109:40 - maybe they still make them
109:43 - if not maybe you could get an old one on
109:45 - ebay
109:48 - i should get a real light bright and
109:49 - have it right behind me like on this
109:51 - shelf and then i could write different
109:53 - things
109:54 - that would be cool
109:58 - um all right back to the live chat
110:04 - uh vince says graphql has to be
110:05 - supported server side doesn't it does
110:08 - ektron support graphql as far as i know
110:10 - ektron doesn't support graphql
110:13 - or much of anything
110:16 - but
110:17 - we're pulling it into wordpress and we
110:19 - have a plugin called wp graphql
110:22 - that does all the work for us to make
110:25 - graphql work with wordpress
110:27 - so that saved us a lot of time and uh
110:29 - the guy um jason
110:32 - yeah what's his last name i can't
110:34 - remember his last name but jason who
110:36 - created that plugin has actually been
110:38 - with us on the live chat several times
110:40 - and helped us work through how to set it
110:42 - up
110:43 - so
110:45 - really good plug-in and it it did save
110:47 - us because i mean i i wouldn't want to
110:49 - have to do all the php work
110:52 - to make graphql work with wordpress
110:55 - i'm just i don't know a lot about php
110:57 - and i'm not really interested in
110:58 - learning more about it right now there's
111:00 - nothing wrong with php but
111:04 - i just want to focus on getting better
111:06 - at javascript
111:08 - um
111:09 - let's see
111:10 - alexis says do you like front end more
111:12 - than back end
111:14 - um
111:19 - i don't know that's stuff quick i i
111:20 - guess i like front end right now more
111:22 - than back end uh because
111:26 - all right it's easier for me because
111:28 - that's where i started out at
111:30 - and you immediately get to see the
111:32 - results and show other people the
111:33 - results and they can say like oh that's
111:36 - cool if you try to explain what you've
111:38 - done on the back end of people who don't
111:39 - really know about it
111:41 - um
111:42 - they don't really understand what's
111:43 - going on and and they
111:46 - so i don't know like it's just
111:48 - you get more positive feedback and
111:50 - things from from people with front-end
111:52 - uh stuff so
111:56 - i don't know but i it's not like i
111:58 - dislike back end like trying to choose
112:00 - between the two is is really tough for
112:02 - me right now it's like
112:04 - asking me what child i like the best
112:06 - right
112:07 - um
112:09 - yeah so
112:10 - i i like both
112:13 - maybe one day i'll make up my mind about
112:15 - which one i really like the best but i
112:18 - can't right now i like working with both
112:23 - um
112:25 - let's see
112:26 - uh alexis says i get started using react
112:29 - and i have no idea what i'm doing i'm
112:30 - more of a back end guy
112:32 - yeah that's how it is i think
112:34 - depending on where you started
112:37 - the you know moving to the other side of
112:40 - things is always like more difficult so
112:42 - like for me front end seems easy and
112:44 - back end seems hard but for a back end
112:46 - person sometimes front end seems hard
112:48 - like i i have an uncle that's been a
112:51 - software developer for
112:53 - i don't know since like the late 70s or
112:55 - something
112:56 - and he does a lot of stuff with c sharp
112:59 - and
113:01 - well when we talk
113:03 - and i'm telling him about some of the
113:04 - stuff i'm doing he's always like really
113:06 - impressed
113:08 - i'm like listen you've been doing this
113:10 - for so long you know i i've got nothing
113:13 - on you
113:14 - and uh but he said he said no like i
113:17 - work with the back end stuff this
113:18 - stuff's all new to me and it's all you
113:20 - know impressive so
113:23 - i kind of like that just to keep that in
113:25 - mind sometimes i i don't like the
113:27 - tendency for like some types of
113:29 - programmers to look down on other types
113:31 - of programs to say that stuff's easy
113:33 - right back end people say oh well the
113:35 - front end you know that's easy stuff uh
113:37 - or whatever
113:39 - um because really it's
113:42 - nothing's easy in in coding in
113:45 - programming right it all takes hard work
113:47 - and it takes hard work to be really good
113:49 - at it
113:50 - so
113:51 - it's just different
113:53 - for different types
113:55 - so there are certain things that you
113:56 - have to worry about in front end that
113:58 - you don't have to worry about back end
113:59 - and vice versa so
114:03 - anyway
114:06 - that's that's how i feel about it
114:10 - evo says not the angular questions
114:13 - we may not ever do anything angular on
114:16 - on this stream so you might not get the
114:18 - questions
114:19 - um
114:21 - james ross says have you ever considered
114:23 - gunner glasses or flux um for your eyes
114:29 - you know what i used to use
114:31 - flux
114:35 - huh
114:36 - i have considered the glasses i saw some
114:38 - i follow a lot of coders on instagram
114:41 - and i saw some of them had had just
114:44 - purchased some of those glasses or they
114:46 - got it as a present or something for
114:48 - christmas
114:49 - and i just got to thinking about them
114:51 - does anybody use those or know about
114:53 - them are they really helpful for
114:55 - eyestrain like i
114:57 - my my office is always dark i keep the
114:59 - lights dim and it cuts down on glare on
115:02 - my screens
115:03 - i try not to keep my screens too bright
115:05 - to help out with it but like
115:07 - i can tell like right now my eyes are
115:09 - fatigued
115:11 - um
115:12 - i'm on a screen
115:14 - i mean you all know how it is like we're
115:15 - looking at a screen all day you know we
115:18 - and even when we're not working
115:20 - you know you got phones you got
115:21 - televisions right i mean
115:24 - we got a nintendo switch for christmas
115:26 - so like
115:28 - i'm up at night
115:29 - [Music]
115:30 - trying to sneak in some time with uh the
115:33 - new zelda game
115:34 - while my kids are sleeping
115:37 - um
115:38 - yeah so if they're if they work i'd
115:43 - i'd be interested in getting some
115:46 - i never wore glasses though it might
115:48 - drive me crazy to actually have them i i
115:50 - mean i guess would be like sunglasses so
115:53 - it wouldn't be too bad
115:56 - uh umberto says i loved magna doodle
115:58 - yeah magnadoodle was cool i was never
116:00 - good with magnadoodle i like to do it
116:02 - but
116:03 - some people drew like amazing things
116:05 - with magnadoodles
116:07 - uh it just takes like a lot of
116:09 - coordination and patience though
116:13 - let's see uh
116:16 - evo says i didn't hear anything about
116:18 - technical questions from my recruiter
116:20 - but i wouldn't be scared about those i
116:22 - usually estimate my capacities as
116:24 - somebody with one year working
116:26 - experience thanks for the offer though
116:28 - oh cool yeah no problem
116:31 - like i said i don't know how much i
116:32 - could help you out anyway i'm just
116:34 - excited
116:36 - um james ross says light bright is
116:38 - extreme choking hazard
116:40 - yeah my my little one cordelia is my
116:44 - youngest right a year and a half she's
116:46 - so cute but she's the ornish little baby
116:49 - and
116:50 - man
116:51 - it's just like
116:53 - she'll put some in her mouth that she's
116:54 - not supposed to walk up to you and open
116:57 - her mouth and let you see it and then
116:59 - run away
117:00 - like she's daring you like hey look what

117:23 - work because my car is not working right
117:25 - now
117:26 - um
117:27 - so
117:29 - cordelia was in the car
117:31 - and i waved goodbye to her as soon as
117:33 - the car drove off she just started
117:34 - crying and screaming that was like the
117:36 - worst thing it just broke my heart but
117:38 - just she wants
117:39 - she wants to be around all the time
117:41 - uh
117:42 - anyway sorry for the side

117:48 - had a little one or something i mean i'm
117:49 - sure you you understand
117:51 - um but
117:53 - it's just crazy how that little person
117:55 - there just
117:57 - you know you do anything for them
118:00 - and they
118:01 - you know they're they're like kind of
118:02 - helpless without you but anyway
118:05 - not coding related sorry
118:10 - um
118:13 - let's see
118:14 - sin says go see hyper js this is super
118:18 - hot
118:19 - what type of js i i haven't heard of
118:21 - hyper js
118:24 - rumble rose says that's basically the
118:26 - same thing i've been thinking i've been
118:27 - doing lots of back end work for my own
118:28 - business for the last two years so i've
118:30 - got lots of projects built for a
118:33 - portfolio
118:34 - that's cool i mean having a good
118:36 - portfolio is where it's at i mean
118:39 - that's what people are looking for what
118:41 - projects have you done
118:42 - if when we hire people here that's all i
118:45 - want to know i could care less about
118:47 - your resume i only read the cover letter
118:49 - to make sure that people are literate
118:52 - and
118:54 - i i want to know like where's the
118:56 - projects let me see them let me see the
118:58 - code
119:02 - oh cool jeff miller says that they do
119:04 - still make light rights
119:06 - and
119:07 - uh
119:08 - his daughter got one a few years ago
119:10 - awesome
119:11 - i'm gonna have to check in on that not
119:13 - right now
119:15 - i i i'd like to get one for my office i
119:17 - wonder if they make little ones
119:19 - that would be safe because cordelia is
119:21 - rarely in my office
119:25 - all right
119:29 - youtube said i thought i clicked this to
119:31 - see some coding oh yeah youtube uh
119:34 - usually at the end of the stream we do
119:37 - question and answers so like the first
119:38 - hour we do mostly like coding and then
119:42 - the second hour is mostly question and
119:44 - answer i was thinking about doing some
119:46 - more stuff with this today but i i don't
119:48 - know because the stream is getting
119:49 - really long now
119:50 - um which is fine the question answer is
119:53 - good
119:54 - um so we might not do any more code if
119:56 - you want to see the code part um
119:59 - check out the recording of the video and
120:01 - and just watch like the first hour
120:03 - um well i take it back skip the first 15
120:06 - minutes because we had technical
120:07 - difficulties
120:08 - and then watched the the next hour after
120:11 - that
120:16 - vince says i've been around long enough
120:17 - to remember watching that commercial on
120:19 - tv
120:23 - uh sj says yeah i was born in the late
120:25 - 80s
120:26 - yeah i was born in 85
120:29 - so i i still like vaguely remember 80s
120:32 - stuff and really like
120:34 - most of my childhood that i remember
120:37 - was from the 90s
120:41 - uh vince says
120:43 - uh this is in response to alexi i
120:46 - started out as a back-end database
120:48 - developer before i knew anything about
120:50 - the web and i definitely like front end
120:52 - better i'm sure opinions differ okay
120:54 - that's that's interesting all right so
120:56 - vince started with back end
120:58 - moves to front end and likes front end
121:01 - so
121:03 - yeah i think
121:04 - it's good to try both and see what you
121:06 - like and then different people are just
121:07 - gonna
121:08 - you know prefer front end or back end or
121:10 - like both
121:12 - all right
121:14 - james ross says which of your children
121:16 - is your favorite he said okay it's
121:18 - cordelia
121:19 - i don't i love
121:21 - they're all so different it's crazy that
121:23 - they're all like
121:25 - they all had like the same set of genes
121:28 - going in right
121:29 - and now they're all
121:31 - so different
121:32 - um so yeah it depends i mean
121:35 - depending on how a certain child is
121:37 - acting i may not like them that much at
121:39 - that moment but overall you know i just
121:41 - have a great time with them and
121:43 - uh even as they get older they change so
121:46 - much
121:47 - all they all have different
121:48 - personalities so
121:49 - you know it's just so hard to make that
121:52 - make that call my wife is different
121:53 - though my wife will tell me like this is
121:56 - my favorite child right now you know
121:59 - she knows exactly and it's usually based
122:01 - on which child gave her a hard time that
122:03 - day
122:05 - and whichever one didn't is the favorite
122:07 - one
122:11 - john
122:12 - hanson says a good perspective jesse
122:14 - problem solving is the key to all sides
122:17 - of coding all are good and important
122:20 - cool thank you i'm glad you agree
122:22 - uh john hanson says they do make a
122:24 - travel size light bright oh that's going
122:26 - on my amazon wishlist right after this
122:28 - stream for sure
122:30 - um
122:32 - cat d says what if your portfolio is a
122:35 - to-do app project and a hello world
122:37 - project
122:38 - uh cat
122:40 - it's better than nothing
122:42 - to i here's what i think some people say
122:44 - don't put like the you know your your
122:47 - projects like your tutorial projects on
122:49 - github but but here's what i think if
122:52 - that's all you have put it on github
122:54 - because it proves that you've actually
122:56 - done some coding
122:57 - later on when you get some real projects
123:00 - then you might want to make those
123:02 - projects private or take them off github
123:05 - i i really don't even worry about it to
123:08 - me
123:09 - here's the way i feel
123:10 - if i see somebody that wants to work
123:12 - here and they have real projects mixed
123:14 - in with tutorials that tells me that
123:17 - they're continuing to learn
123:19 - right and they're not too good for
123:21 - tutorials anymore
123:23 - all right
123:25 - and i like that i appreciate that
123:26 - because if i find a dev that
123:29 - isn't learning anymore i don't want to
123:31 - work with that dab no matter how good
123:32 - they are right now
123:33 - in two years they're going to be
123:35 - terrible because they won't have kept up
123:37 - with anything so
123:40 - so cat go with that if you can but try
123:43 - try your best to get some some other
123:46 - projects on there you know as soon as
123:48 - you can
123:49 - you know before you really start trying
123:51 - to apply for places
123:53 - and they don't have to be paying
123:55 - projects they could just be some side
123:57 - project that you really like or
124:00 - you could try to contribute to other
124:01 - people's projects
124:04 - so
124:05 - like you can contribute to the projects
124:07 - that we work on i try to make some
124:09 - issues like easy for beginners to just
124:12 - learn the process of submitting a pull
124:14 - request on github
124:16 - so
124:17 - if you're interested in doing that let
124:18 - me know you can message me on twitter or
124:20 - something and i could
124:22 - help get you some more info i mean if
124:24 - you already know how to do it that's
124:25 - cool i don't want to assume that you
124:26 - don't but if you need more help let me
124:28 - know
124:29 - um or find some other uh project that
124:32 - you really like and see if there's
124:34 - something you can contribute to because
124:36 - employers will see that too you know
124:37 - they'll see a record of your
124:39 - contributions even if it's not your own
124:41 - project
124:44 - hopefully that helped let me know if
124:46 - that was wasn't helpful or if it was
124:48 - confusing or anything and i'll try to
124:50 - clarify
124:52 - vince says um if you're curious
124:54 - originally oracle um
124:57 - pl sql developer for phone company
125:00 - oh interesting
125:02 - interesting i've never done anything
125:04 - with oracle
125:08 - uh sj says i actually have special
125:10 - lighting in my office that's
125:12 - specifically designed for offices where
125:14 - the computer users spend hours on the
125:16 - computer it's really good for the eyes
125:19 - oh that's that's actually pretty cool
125:21 - maybe i'll have to look into that
125:23 - i mean i really should think about this
125:25 - if i'm going to be a programmer for the
125:26 - next
125:27 - i don't know until i retire right
125:30 - um
125:31 - i should probably think about the effect
125:33 - it's going to have on my eyes long term
125:36 - uh hammond said please say something on
125:39 - full stack with react i have to finish a
125:42 - voting app for free code camp i know
125:44 - react but i'm confused to use react or
125:47 - not um yeah so
125:50 - i would say uh for react
125:55 - like you could do full stack javascript
125:57 - right so and you could use react on the
125:59 - front end and then node on the back end
126:02 - um
126:03 - react works a little bit server-side as
126:06 - well so um
126:08 - you can do server-side rendering with
126:09 - react
126:10 - and then serve those pages and then
126:13 - potentially do client-side routing and
126:15 - stuff uh
126:16 - you know once everything loads in the
126:18 - browser
126:20 - so
126:21 - you can do some things like that for
126:23 - your project i don't think that would be
126:25 - necessary to actually do server-side
126:27 - rendering unless you really wanted to
126:29 - but i definitely think it's it's uh
126:32 - a good idea
126:34 - to do
126:36 - full stack javascript all the way across
126:38 - it just makes sense you know you learn
126:41 - one language and you're able to do
126:42 - front-end and back-end
126:45 - i think that's cool
126:46 - if you got to learn something else for a
126:48 - project that's fine too right like we
126:50 - use php sometimes
126:53 - but if if you're trying to learn and
126:54 - start out and being able to do things
126:56 - then you'll save a lot of time by
126:58 - learning javascript and being able to
127:01 - write it on the front end of the back
127:02 - end so
127:04 - um
127:05 - i mean if you have the time and you'd
127:06 - like to learn more about react it might
127:08 - be really cool to try to do that voting
127:09 - app with react and set up the back end
127:11 - with node
127:13 - um
127:14 - if you're more comfortable with
127:15 - something else though and you just need
127:16 - to get it done then
127:18 - you know go with that i don't think
127:20 - there's any real reason why you
127:22 - really really would want to use react
127:24 - for that
127:26 - but i i really like using it i think
127:28 - it's improved the quality of my work
127:31 - uh and i think it's fun to to work with
127:34 - once you you know once you get the hang
127:35 - of it i really enjoy it
127:38 - vince says it looks like you're about to
127:40 - wrap up and i have to go anyway i enjoy
127:41 - this though i'll look for your live
127:42 - stream again if i can thanks oh you're
127:45 - welcome vince thanks so much i really
127:47 - enjoyed talking with you uh on the live
127:49 - chat um so yeah hopefully you can come
127:51 - back for another
127:52 - uh another stream sometime
127:54 - uh hamlet said i saw some tutorials uh
127:57 - they use two servers it's confusing yeah
128:00 - yeah uh we use two servers sometimes for
128:02 - some of the things we do so basically
128:04 - you'd have
128:05 - um
128:06 - a back-end server that's node.js
128:10 - and it it handles
128:12 - um
128:15 - it can handle things like
128:17 - like routing um
128:19 - uh data like
128:22 - grabbing data from a form or something
128:24 - and sending it off emailing it or you
128:26 - know using it with an api
128:29 - and then you would have another server
128:31 - that would just run your react app
128:34 - so usually like if you have an api or
128:37 - something then
128:38 - you know you want to run that as a
128:40 - separate server
128:42 - you don't have to i suppose um
128:47 - trying to think out
128:50 - like you could let me say this way you
128:52 - could have all the code in one project
128:54 - right all one one github project but you
128:57 - would still want to run that separately
128:59 - right like you want run something on
129:01 - let's say port 3000 that would be like
129:03 - your react app and then on port 8080
129:06 - you'd run your api and then like locally
129:09 - you could just hit that api
129:11 - you know on that port and then when you
129:13 - actually go to put that into
129:16 - a production setting right you would
129:18 - still run
129:20 - you know your server
129:22 - on on a separate port right and then you
129:24 - could just hit that from within the same
129:26 - server if you wanted to
129:28 - and then have like your client-side
129:30 - stuff or your react stuff publicly
129:32 - available
129:34 - hopefully that's not super confusing but
129:37 - i would say like
129:39 - yeah having two servers
129:41 - um when you need like a back end in the
129:44 - front end is not unheard of
129:49 - let's see
129:50 - oh cool cat d says yes very thankful
129:53 - thanks all right all right uh cool
129:55 - i'm glad i could uh glad i could help
129:58 - all right so i've gotten to the end of
129:59 - the live chat i definitely don't really
130:02 - want to go any longer with this because
130:03 - we're already over two hours uh with the
130:06 - stream
130:07 - um which is fine but i think it's really
130:08 - intimidating for people to see a video
130:10 - that's two hours long and say like wow
130:12 - i'm not gonna sit through two hours so
130:14 - um i like to keep it somewhere between
130:16 - one and two hours and don't go much over
130:20 - um
130:22 - let's see
130:23 - he says oh emmanuel said i don't
130:25 - understand
130:27 - right let let me know what you don't
130:29 - understand i'm assuming that you're
130:30 - talking about like when i was talking
130:32 - about running two different servers
130:34 - uh let me know if that's the case and
130:37 - and i'll try to
130:38 - i can pull up a repo where i ran two
130:40 - different servers if if you want to see
130:42 - an example
130:45 - um
130:46 - let me
130:49 - i'm gonna yeah okay let me pull up a
130:51 - repository that i did actually run two
130:53 - servers with
130:55 - um so
130:57 - let's go to
130:59 - i don't think it's here let me get my
131:01 - profile
131:04 - um
131:06 - i'll make everything bigger so you can
131:08 - see it as soon as i find the
131:10 - repository
131:13 - and it was
131:14 - [Music]
131:22 - there we go
131:23 - all right so this was one of my projects
131:25 - that i did when i was doing the react
131:26 - nano degree
131:28 - um
131:49 - um
131:55 - oh you know what actually i think i had
131:57 - the server in two different spots so
132:01 - uh this project i was the first cohort
132:04 - to go through so they changed it a
132:06 - little bit when i first started this
132:08 - project they had the server separate
132:10 - uh and then a couple weeks later when i
132:13 - checked back again um they had changed
132:15 - it so server is actually in the same
132:17 - repo
132:18 - but at that point i was almost done with
132:19 - the project so i didn't switch it over
132:21 - so basically here's what you would do
132:23 - this
132:24 - is your react app right and if i go into
132:27 - source here you can see i have
132:31 - you know just like a normal index.js and
132:33 - everything and
132:36 - then over here
132:38 - this is the api server where all the
132:41 - data is so we have this server.js file
132:44 - so
132:45 - what you do is you start this up
132:48 - and then i'd be able to get posts
132:50 - i'd be able to create posts and have
132:52 - them stored here
132:57 - and
132:58 - i could get posts i could edit them
133:01 - but
133:02 - i still had to run this
133:07 - and let me see where i had
133:12 - see if it's my reducers no it's um
133:16 - utils
133:17 - so you can see where i'm hitting that
133:19 - api
133:23 - oops i forgot to make the text uh font
133:25 - size bigger sorry about that
133:27 - all right so here like we're hitting
133:29 - that api
133:32 - so i'm running the server on localhost
133:35 - 3001
133:37 - i'm hitting that api to get the data
133:40 - um so like this just grabs
133:42 - all the posts
133:43 - um this one gets posts from a certain
133:46 - category this one actually gets just one
133:48 - post based on an id
133:50 - this one obviously deletes a post so you
133:53 - can see like we're hitting that api that
133:55 - other separate server um from this app
134:00 - this app would run
134:02 - you know its own
134:04 - on its own server right so or you know
134:07 - in this case on its own port on on
134:10 - localhost so i think this one would
134:12 - probably run on 3000 and then we had the
134:14 - api running on 3001.
134:17 - uh so this is not unlike what you would
134:19 - do in a lot of production apps i mean
134:21 - um
134:22 - like right now
134:24 - we we're getting the data from
134:27 - the from wordpress through graphql
134:30 - so that runs on it it's a whole separate
134:32 - thing
134:34 - um and then in react which we're running
134:37 - locally
134:38 - we're grabbing that data right so we
134:40 - have two set up there if you were to do
134:42 - javascript full stack you would have the
134:45 - same setup you would make some sort of
134:47 - an api to manage your content
134:50 - and that would be running
134:53 - and then you would have somewhere else
134:57 - probably a react app
134:59 - that would run and it would run
135:01 - um so that clients could could hit that
135:04 - you know with their browsers
135:07 - um you know users
135:09 - but it would grab the data from the api
135:12 - um so
135:14 - i mean i think it's
135:15 - it's a common thing uh but just when
135:18 - we're talking about javascript and doing
135:20 - it all in javascript it can be confusing
135:22 - like why do we need uh two different
135:27 - you know two different ones
135:29 - so
135:31 - anyway that's why do you absolutely need
135:34 - two different servers probably not i
135:35 - mean think about you just think about
135:37 - the way wordpress works normally
135:39 - normally you do everything just in in
135:41 - wordpress itself it hits the database
135:44 - you use php to put together everything
135:47 - and then it spits out markup to the
135:49 - client right
135:51 - um
135:53 - but a lot of sites now are drawing data
135:56 - from separate apis
135:58 - so
136:00 - anyway so that's that's kind of what i
136:01 - was trying to explain all right emmanuel
136:04 - says okay i think i grasp it now we'll
136:06 - read more on it all right cool
136:08 - cool yeah thanks for the question too
136:10 - because i'm sure there are others that
136:11 - are either watching now or will watch
136:13 - later that probably were confused too
136:15 - i'm sure i didn't do a great job
136:17 - explaining it
136:18 - but
136:20 - hopefully that maybe just
136:22 - helps you out a little bit and
136:25 - now you'll know like what to look up
136:27 - uh to read more about it
136:29 - all right
136:31 - so
136:33 - i am going to uh stop streaming now
136:36 - see tomorrow's

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse sorry about the delay i was trying to get uh everything set up right something is making my fan uh run like really high and so i've been closing down windows and if i had more time i just would have restarted the computer completely but i didn't want it to affect the video quality because i'm noticing like the last day or two the fans been running uh pretty loudly and they'll be weird parts of the videos either recording or the streams where things just kind of slow down a little bit anyway i think it's working now let me know if there's something wrong with the quality and i'll do what i can to get that fixed all right so hey everyone see a lot of people in the live chat saying hello all right so here's the plan today we're gonna do pretty much what we did yesterday uh maybe we'll get into some different things but we're still gonna keep working on this this site and if you're just joining us for the first time or you haven't been around for a while this is working with react we're working with graphql nexjs uh we're using wordpress as uh headless cms um so we have a lot going on we're doing some transfer data from one database to another uh so we're gonna do a little bit of you know whatever we need to do today to get things moving so i had a meeting this morning and i kind of reported on our progress for the site and i think most of people were impressed by how it's coming they're they're anxious to see something so it'd be cool to get it to a point where it'd be reasonable to allow other people to see it and test it all right hey gideon's here i haven't haven't seen gideon in here for a while uh how's it going gideon you're stuck video's broken oh no the video is broken again huh i just don't understand all right yeah let me switch to the other let's switch to this screen did any of you see the the switch let let me know right now you should see me really small down in the corner um and then you should see the the desktop on one of my screens all right everybody yay looks like everyone can see me well i don't want to say everyone um some of you can see all right so my fan on my computer is still running you know pretty loudly which is weird so i'm still really not sure what the problem is with that um but if it's fine for most people then we'll we'll go with it and so sorry about the delay that's going to be terrible in the recording but at least anybody watching could just skip ahead i guess um rumble bro says if you're using obs drop the video and coding level down a notch uh yeah i'm i'm gonna have to do that it's it's just we i've been using the same settings for the last six months and and they've been fine i haven't changed anything um in fact i've actually doubled the amount of ram i have on my machine so it's just odd that all of a sudden i'm having these problems so uh it maybe after the stream i'll check out my settings lower them a little bit and see see if i can get a better result i definitely want to keep 1080p quality uh because it makes the code so much easier to read um i'm running right now um harsha said check the task manager uh i've i've checked the task manager for uh for chrome well the chrome tab manager uh i've i've checked that and got rid of pretty much everything i'm down to just a few tabs open now um you know i have to have youtube up i have to have the stuff up that i'm working with but pretty much everything else is closed right now i got i'm gonna i closed slack um let me close my email using outlook for work i'm just gonna close everything uh let me close out chrome canary cause i'm not using it right now um obs let's see yeah there's just there's not much else that i could even close out i mean maybe i have i i do have a lot of projects open in visual studio code but i'm working on all those projects um all right i'll ch i'm not gonna check it all out during the stream if it starts to get bad i'll go back and check things out but um thanks i will check the resource monitor on mac and um so thanks uh thanks for the advice uh rumble bros and all right cool i'll make sure i go back through and reread this advice um when when the stream's over and i'll i'll work on it what's this go to turn harsh it says go to the terminal and type top all right oh nice hard awesome i never knew you could do that all right well let's check this out so here's a really good tip we can see what's going on here um all right all right code helper so i'm guessing that code helper has something to do with visual studio code and that is taking up by far the most oh it's just well chrome is taking up the most it looks like but i can't really do much about the windows i have open now so i need them open all right let's see what i have running on visual studio code and what i can shut down i do have let's see what i don't need and i'll need this and there's my other stuff did they not open ah when i restarted all my uh code windows there they are all right i was worried for a second i'd lost everything all right so this is all right i was working on this but i'm not going to work on it for the stream shall shut that down we will use this one let's make that bigger and we will use let's see what if i have any other things running here no it shouldn't have anything running it's uh all right let me let me close out of that for a second um because i do want to run we're going to need to run this anyway so i'll just get it started right now and then i can start and grow all right all right so i'm going to paste this in the live chat oh okay blake's asking about what i have yeah i have i upgraded to 32 gigs of ram sometime within the last six months or so uh let me see what the rest is about this mac i'll move it over here it's it's really small though i doubt you'll be able to see the text but yeah so i i've 32 gigs of ram um intel core i7 2 gigs graphics all right um yeah i mean that seems like it should be able to handle um live streaming something especially since i've done it um yeah but i'm still it looks like i'm still dropping some frames um dropping like two percent of the frames i need to learn more about how video works if i'm going to live stream every day then maybe i ought to learn how to do this properly um all right so sorry for all the trouble i'll just have to dig more into this at some point hopefully we've closed out enough things that we can just work let me i don't need this open you don't really need that open we are going to work with this and what's this migrate yeah we are working with this so let's leave this open and let's see i guess i can close this out we need one timer open so i'll leave that open and i don't really need this trello board right now are we getting down we're getting down pretty lean here not much else i can do all right all right harsha's asking about the encoding format that i'm using and let's see i'm trying to find it i don't remember offhand what i was using and now i can't remember where it's at in my settings hmm all right oh it looks like looks like it's it's okay now all right yeah let's get to work good good idea hershey um all right so let's at least get this open so here's our site and here's our cute dog this is what we had done uh just kind of get a little layout here still haven't had a chance to show this to my boss i'm gonna try i tried to go in earlier to see him and uh he had already left for lunch so i'm gonna try after the stream today and see if he's in he's just been really busy lately uh with meetings and stuff so let's see yeah so we have some work to do oh i do want to show you before i forget let me show you the uh github repo now because i've updated a lot of things i think i should did i show y'all yesterday i may have but um oops forgot to start the pomodoro timer let's start that up all right so just to let everyone know um we have a project now and you can check this out you can check things out here or if you just want to go to the issues tab there's a bunch of issues open if anyone's interested in trying to contribute to a project you'll go ahead if you're new and you've never contributed to a project before check these out you can ask me i'd be happy to help you get your first github pool request merged so i'm gonna eventually go through these but i'm gonna hold off a little bit and then that way if anybody does want to contribute these are kind of all laid out you know what needs to be done if you're not exactly sure what needs to be done just you know leave a comment on that issue and then i can give you more information for that so what i think we should do now is let me make sure i'm on the right network all right cool um let's grab some some more data and bring over let's see what i want to bring over let's see if we can bring over our department pages how did the search and put field animated in previous oh all right actually we do have a question about one of these issues now and that's a really good question i i should have put this in here anyway which one is that there we are so for this issue uh on click the search icon in the top bar should expand to reveal a text field so let's let's find a project that this happens on it was the bulletin wasn't it see if i have this up here already i don't think i do i believe we had this working properly on uh the bulletin um yeah let's try that out here let me make this a bit bigger for anybody who's not familiar with using the command line this will be kind of like a little intro because i'm going to do some basic stuff and then i'm going to do some um just a few you know commands with um like starting a server up so we're going to cd um we're going to go so we're going to change our directory and i'm going to go into my projects directory and then i'm going to do an ls and that's going to tell me everything that's in my projects directory and i'm looking for something that's bulletin so bulletin react is the folder i'm looking for so i want to see the end of there bulletin react notice i didn't type it all out i typed in bul and then hit tab and the rest of it auto completed so that's kind of a cool feature it'll save you a lot of time typing and you won't make as many mistakes as you're not trying to type out the whole field so now that we have this um let's open i'm going to open it in a text let's go nano package package.json so i'm going to open it in this this little editor called nano is a really simple editor uh that'll open right right in our right in our terminal you'll see so it just opened here and i can see what's in here i could edit it and it has a lot of the you know commands you can use right here a lot of the keyboard shortcuts but what i want to see is what our startup script is uh looks like start will work for us all right so i'm going to close this out and to close to close this out i just hit control x and that closes out nano since i didn't change anything it didn't ask me if i wanted to save otherwise it would have asked me if i wanted to save so now that i know what our command is we can go yarn start and we've already set up this project to run the servers so this is a little bit different than what you'd normally have if you know a project had been done oops okay so it we already had our main project running on port 3000 so it has started um our project started server started for uh i'm afraid we're running the back end and not the front end one all right let me just shut this down for a second if you hit ctrl c that'll shut down your server generally if you're in if you have something running in your command line you want to get out of it try control c that works for a lot of things so i'm going to restart this and there we are this should be better why is it so slow go closed there we are oh no did we implement the login system no um can i submit no i need to validate i'm not like i'm happy that we have the login system and that's that's awesome but it just slowed me down here it's been a while since we've worked on this project i really do want to finish this up and and launch it but we've we've just gotten sidetracked uh by these other important projects um and i closed on my email which is smart let's um let me open up my email again i think i can get to it from here um whoa oh no i restarted so now even my passwords aren't here it's taking a lot longer i thought and i also authenticate you've got to be kidding me it uses mailtrap saying it it uses mail trap i'm trying to remember what we did i don't remember for sure so are you saying that where it's not actually gonna send the email yet and i need to go to mail trap all right let's check out mailchat all right okay so we did get it in mail trap uh let's see all right here we are yeah all right so hopefully this actually is set up or all this work has been for nothing all right awesome so let's zoom in here and see how this works so we click on it it opens up it automatically uh fills it puts the cursor in here this is just a basic material design style text field but then we also have this close icon and weak so we can close it back up again so that's how we want it to work this is i i would probably change this slightly just uh i would want this to have a little bit slower animation when it opens up and it would be nicer if when this opened the x kind of looked like it was part of this so maybe if the x was here or if this was moved up a bit so it integrated you know a little bit better but basically like this is this is what i want um so even if this was implemented exactly like this i would be happy and if we had time later on i would just kind of adjust it slightly but that's what we want so since this project is using material ui the beta version i believe it is material ui the beta version and it should be able to copy most of that code and it should work uh and all that of course is on on github under the i believe it's bulletin react is the um uh the github project name all right i heard she's talking about the masonry yeah the masonry uses materialize yeah for the masonry stuff so it's a blend and materialize yeah harsh it's i like how this works right here this is good the only thing we're going to have to solve or figure some way around is right now on our main project which we'll go back to in just just a minute uh we have cards that are not only different heights they're also different widths so i i don't think switching to materialized columns is is going to fix that um you know by itself i hope i'm mistaken about that and it does um we'll just we'll have to see we'll have to to mess around but i don't want to spend any more time on the home page until i show to my boss see what he thinks because we may just end up wasting time on something that might not make it into the final version of the site evo says i think i would slightly lighten the shadow under the nav bar it just looks too dark a little too dark for my liking um yeah maybe off to see um if this is basically sorry if you ever see anything uh in any of the projects that seems like it's not in line with um the material design uh standards let me know i would definitely change it if that's the case so if this the shadow recommended for you know the app bar here is not the right shadow i'll change it um you know no problem um i i just i want to keep everything consistent so let's see we'll have to look at it in our other project as well and see if it's this dark i don't remember doing anything custom to dark in this but you never know yeah you're right uh evo says it it just it looks a little out of place you're right with this elevation it does seem odd maybe before i mean this this is still a work in progress right uh so this isn't live anywhere but i mean you could see this obviously has an elevation but then this doesn't and it just makes it it's it's an odd effect here you know if we were to like pan this and be able to look at it like straight on it would be like this is up a lot higher than this side nav you know but from here it looks like they're it's just odd right i mean the way the shadows are there should be something with the shadow right either this should have a shadow here or there should be some sort of slight shadow on this edge so i i agree i think that looks weird i'll have to go back to the documentation see how it's handled there um and then yeah and then we'll figure we'll have to figure it out because even you know right now the sidebar is just completely flat against the background right so it's it has no elevation at all yeah we'll have to end oh well we're not we're not working on this bulletin project today so i'm getting kind of sidetracked but i i definitely agree with you evo i this this does look weird and it kind of breaks the illusion of the different elevations all right so let's close out um oh rook rook says sorry for derailing you from the main site project ah don't worry about it that's i mean that happens this uh i think that's kind of how things always are you see something on one project and it reminds you of something else and you end up you know going around uh it's a different thing so that's just normal what do i have on post support mainstream to materialize oh all right uh i just noticed this issue harshit uh so thanks thanks for making that um an issue i don't yeah i don't think i made one for it so thank you let's shut down this server that was actually two servers the front end and back end and now let's start this one up again for our main project all right so it looks good let's verify that that is working and the ngrok link still should work yeah oh evo don't worry about being nitpicky i mean i nitpicky is good nitpicky i think is the difference between a good site and and a perfect site right a great site because somebody will see that not everybody but someone will see that and if it's good they probably won't even notice but if it's doesn't if it looks weird they will notice and they'll have a bad experience with it all right so let's get started we actually have eight minutes left in this uh pomodoro session and i i will take a break and go back to the live chat because there's a lot uh up top that i i just kind of skipped over john hanson said he saw it too john your uh your light bright thing that you made that shared on twitter it's getting a lot of love on twitter it's getting some retweets and and likes and stuff so everybody likes it so you did a great job on that i shared it with some of my coworkers and they were like making designs on it and screenshotting it and then sending on slack so really cool all right evo says it's like that one smudge you made on your car three years ago which nobody else sees except for you yeah exactly exactly that's that's definitely me i noticed like the one tiny spot on a shirt you know that i got like pasta sauce on a long time ago and it always bothers me if i ever wear that shirt like somebody's gonna see that tiny spot no one ever says anything all right so let's go first step is let's figure out what content we're going to bring over once we figure that out we gotta figure out um how are we gonna get all the content what fields do we need to bring over we use our migrate.js program to pull the data out of the sql server database and then use the wordpress api to put it into the mysql database once we have it there then we're gonna have to create a graphql query to get the data out and we're gonna need a new page a new react component to put the data in so that's the plan once we have the data in we see what we have then maybe we'll style it a little bit and if you notice as we're going i'm not making these perfect right we're just styling a bit so that they don't look so terrible uh this is kind of on purpose because i'd rather get a just get a bunch of stuff in there be able to show it to other people in my department get some feedback before i do that fine tuning because i i we have a tight deadline and i don't want to waste time so i'm going to try to leave everything really rough at first because if if we have the data there and it doesn't look perfect we can still launch and the site will be a million times better than the current site because it'll be fast it'll be easy to find it'll be very clean and not cluttered we can always finetune it later ideally i'd like i'd love it to be perfect before launch but that's just it's not gonna happen it's not reasonable given the amount of time that we have i do have hopefully some interns that are gonna start uh working uh for me in like two weeks or something but i don't really know how soon they're gonna be able to get in and start helping so i can't really rely on that uh to help speed things up i mean maybe best case scenario uh i get all three interns that are considering and they're great and they know what's going on and they can help but i'm i'm not planning on it i'm planning on you know basically me and you all helping doing all the work for the most part um all right let's see okay so let me get something done in these last four minutes here and then i'll go back to the live chat and and do the questions um where's our database ice you know what it'll be better if we go um franciscan if we go to the site itself it'll be way easier to just pick it up than looking through records in a database i want to try to pick out main content sections so so far we have faculty member profiles we have the directories for the different departments and we have all the news stories so i want to try to just pick out what's a section that stands out as a really important section and i'm doing it like this because what if we can't get all the sections into the site before we launch let's make sure we have all the important sections first and if there's stuff that needs to come in after then that's fine i'm not worried about it so let's go to the about employment hr get some information i'm mostly trying to pick up things that would be for prospective students if something is geared towards like current employees or current students i'm not worried about because that essentially shouldn't be on this site anyway we have another internal site that should handle all of that all right curriculum academic departments we haven't brought these over i started to do some work to figure out where this was at in the database i think we should bring these over these are definitely important prospective students will most most likely want to check out our different departments and you know figure out what we teach here so all right so it's under the departments let's let's go here this uh accounting business administration economics okay so departments acc hyphen bus hyphen ec really not liking that that url but uh we'll have to keep that in mind because this is a place that i think uh we do want to try to keep the same urls there's going to be a limited number of departments so if we have to manually put in and change the slugs on these to make a match i'm okay with that right i definitely didn't want to do it with the 540 some news posts that we brought in yesterday i'm willing to do it for these departments though uh all right so let's see i believe the content that we'll want to keep over anything is this and possibly this these are links all right these are our links elsewhere i'm just making sure there's no toggles here for the content um these are fine these we can recreate this and pull this from faculty profiles if we want um let's see this program accounting these read more things i'm not really worried about about this uh this is i i don't think this is super important to have something like this all right all right so now let's find where this data is so i've done and this is gonna slo let me open up on another screen just in case i don't think there's any private data in this database at least in the part that i've taken out of here but better better safe than sorry so i'm gonna open on my other screen just to make sure that everything's okay uh and if it is then i'll bring it over on this screen and show you what i've done is i've pulled out a lot of the data from that database and i put it into a google sheet so that i can more easily sort the data filter it search for things it's a lot easier for me to do that in a google sheet than it is for me to come up with the correct sql queries so that's why i'm doing it this way it should be in my recent documents i hope all right i believe this is it it's a really huge one so hopefully it doesn't mess anything up all right good this is what we have unfortunately i didn't bring over all the data uh so it once we find what we want we're we're gonna have to try to search for it based on the um the id which is okay we're already set up with a query to do that so i'm going to try to find and let's see let's just start typing in business programs all right so we got that that's definitely not it that's not it oops it might be frozen it is let me refresh the page maybe i should pull this into excel maybe it's just too much strain on a google sheet all right let's exit that page and um let's pull that same data into excel alright uh it's asking me to update it i don't want to update it all right here so excel just opened up really huge on my other screen so i can't see the live chat anymore all right if it says it looks like the sql query might have been easier after all yeah i was thinking the same thing all right so now i have this open in excel and let's do a find are there no keyboard short there we go um business programs there we are got it and ah this is not good not good all right well let's search um 222. um yeah let's search for folder 222. the reason i'm saying this is not good is that this the different content types in folder 222 they're they're not all it's not what i wanted but let's just check it out so let me find this is our microsoft sql operations studio let's get i always forget how to do a new query nope how do i do a new query there we are okay um i'm going to need to the easiest way is just going to be to pull this that way i don't have to type it all out again and so let's paste that in and use what i want to see is everything and then we'll uh we'll pair it down to what we just need so we're going to select everything from the folder content or the table content i'm not sure with terminology is where the folder id is 222 and i don't want any records where the there's no content all right so that makes sense that's that's a waste we don't want those so let's run that and it's gonna ask me to pick the server and this is the server all right so here's what we're working with i don't really care about these right now um content title and the html are really what i want to see the most sample sample program hmm well this is not as bad as i thought all right actually it's just a little bad um these are just menus all right all right let's think about this for a second before we bring it over let me check my timer it's got to be up i know it is up i must not have heard it okay all right let me let's take a break right now i'm going to go back to the live chat this will give me a second to process you know what with the data we just saw what we're going to do with it uh when i when the timer is up i'm going to explain um why i think this is going to be a little bit of a problem all right so let me scroll up and go down through our chat also we have a major problem all right it's good my spotify wasn't working now it is so we're good let's see all right so the first half of everything in the live chat is just about how the stream was not uh operating properly everything was lagging or stuck uh so blake asks if i've ever done any social media marketing yes i have uh so when i was freelancing uh so this was maybe like two and a half years ago i stopped well i didn't stop freelancing completely but i stopped like actively looking for clients uh i would do social media marketing and pretty much anything else that a small business might want that it had anything to do with the internet so social media marketing was a part of that it's not my i didn't really enjoy social media marketing as much as i enjoyed other things it was i don't know if i want to say it was my least favorite part of what i did but it was definitely low low on the list of things uh that i i like to do it was but if you have any questions blake about social media marketing let me know uh in my department we do a lot of social media marketing i don't handle it directly at all um i have access to our some of our accounts and for like an emergency if several other people in the department are all sick and we can't get a hold of him then i i can do it but that's not really my thing but if i i still know a little bit about it so if you have any questions let me know uh evo says that's the way i like to work as well work out the bass first and start perfecting it afterwards with clients it's usually that they find the bass good enough even though they said they don't yeah yeah that's yeah i've the only problem i've had with that and i still i like to do it i think it's the best is sometimes you go in to show clients or in my case other people that i work with here they're expecting when you go to show them sometimes they're expecting too much and you're just showing them kind of like a concept like first draft type of thing and they they're really disappointed they start asking about all these little details and they kind of miss the point of you know this is a big picture overview just to kind of show you what's possible and what's going on so sometimes they can be disappointed and get stuck um on on some of the little rough details so i i do have to like warn people going into a meeting when i'm going to show them this like hey it's not finished it's just a rough draft like if you see something that's wrong like it's probably gonna be finished you know i still welcome any input but uh i do have to be careful about that i think i walked into a meeting one time and somebody that is higher up where i work um said they hated they hated it they hated my project i think i had sent a link out to it before the meeting and then i found out that they said they hated so at the meeting i was very careful to explain everything uh since i knew going in that uh it wasn't exactly understood that it was a first draft oh rook had to go uh sorry i i missed that you're probably already gone but by anyway i'm sure you'll watch this later on yeah evo says wow that site took really long to load i think that you were talking about this site this main franciscan website yeah that's one of the reasons why i think anything we build will be perceived as better because right now the load times are so so bad i think a lot of people don't even stick around to see the site i'm not going to use as an excuse to slack off i really want to make a good site in its own right but you know we we have that going for us though our site is most definitely going to be way faster uh then this site i want it to be faster than than most sites you know out there certainly any of our competitors other universities i want this to be the fastest site uh philip says is that out of the box uh visual studio code any special extension to get that view um yeah i do have some different extensions so hmm maybe i don't have the sound enabled on this let me refresh and see allow notifications huh all right i keep missing that the timers up uh guys so i do have some things so my theme is seti so it's seti that's the theme that i use and i also use a bunch of plugins to handle react type stuff so if you look up react is it react food truck i think that's what it's called react food truck is a plugin that will automatically download a bunch of other plugins for you that all have to do with making it easier to develop react applications in visual studio code so i checked that out i have very few additions to that setup so if you want your setup to look more like mine then i start with that and then if there's something that still doesn't look the same ask me and i i can kind of look more into my plugins i really can't tell you what i have offhand i'd have to look myself all right let's see oop let me start my timer here all right so oh i'm sorry i just saw this this is really exciting so i'm going to read this comment uh john hanson said quincy is going to put my light bright on free code camp as an extracurricular project cool yeah all right um that's awesome john i'm so happy about that that's really really cool that's going to be a fun project for people to do wow really cool really cool if if you you all haven't seen john's light bright project on uh codepen uh check it out uh if you wanna link check out my my twitter page i i posted um or i i retweeted something from john that has the link to it uh yesterday so it'll be in one of my top my top posts uh check it out there and if you like it give give john some love on codepen and twitter it's it's cool it's really cool all right so let me let's go back to our data you know quickly i'm gonna do with it oh way over here all right let's go back to our data and all right so this is this is what i'm worried about this is my problem so i was hoping that i could get find a folder or something that had all of the main programs in a folder but that's that's not the case what we have is everything that's under like the business department is all here but they're all different types so we these are called quick links which are basically just lists of of links which we may or may not need i'll have to check closer into these links i mean they might not even work with our new structure i'm trying to keep all the urls the same but i don't think we can keep all of them the same um finance classes text i mean and they have text these are all texts for specific sets of classes up here we have all these like programs that are really kind of like sub programs underneath this main header so this is kind of the main thing and then pretty much everything else on here is under that you know it's kind of a sub section of that so it's going to make it a lot more difficult just to pull all this stuff in under one post type all right um vince just asked if i could share the link to the light brite thing yeah on the next uh break the next five minute break i'll i'll find the link and i'll and i'll share it all right let me i'm gonna go over here and see if there's anything that might differentiate any of this stuff hmm looks like these teasers are going to be pretty worthless so some of them are some of them might be okay hmm hmm all right well it looks like we could get at the very least the text for these different programs and i think that that will be worthwhile let's double check here so from this main academics page these are all the departments listed and then these underneath here listed as majors all right let's see what what the url structure is like for one of these oh it's just accounting there's not even anything in between let's verify that it's the same oh this is not this is not good not good not good i'm i mean where are we gonna find this this is going to take a lot more manual work um all right cool vince found the link uh so uh awesome wow all right let's grab i guess some different content because this is just not this is not going to work out i wonder if there's consistency departments nursing okay and now they have the major that's nursing all right maybe i should just go we'll get some data from somewhere else because this is a mess all right thanks get that mix all right let's check academics well we looked at academic departments already so this is where all those majors pages were all right all right so let's so we we basically have two we have two different listings that have a lot of the same information uh so all the majors that a student can take are listed on this page here then there's the other page that we just came from the list academic departments so these majors are grouped into different departments but for some reason the urls on these which should say franciscan.edu slash majors and then slash whatever the major is don't it just franciscan.edu and then whatever the major is and that makes it a little bit weird and it's the all the other thing that makes this tough is within the same folders which is really the only reliable way that we found to uh to pull in data like all of a certain type so within the folders it includes both the pages for majors and the pages and content for departments as well as some other stuff all right so here's what i'm thinking what if um we made a content type to house both programs and majors within that content type we had a category set up and we had a category for a program and a category for major so that when we go to grab that data for our our app we could sort it out yeah we're gonna we basically we could sort those out so that we can just grab all the programs or we could just grab all the majors maybe we'll need to have i think we're gonna have to have two taxonomies so we're gonna need some set of like categories but then also maybe tags that go along with the name of a program because we're going to need to be able to bring in program info or links to programs within those all right so we don't have to decide that yet first thing we have to do is bring the data over unfortunately we're going to have to manually check and say which ones are majors and which ones are programs because there's no reliable data it seems that we could pull that and do it pro programmatically so let's test it by first bringing in this folder 222 that we found let's bring in 222 see what we have categorize what we need to and then get rid of what we need to uh that'll give us an idea of how long it will take per folder and then we can figure you know hey is this worth it is this not worth it all right that's the plan that's the plan for now all right so let's go to our migrate.js program here let me make the font size larger and we're going to go to 222 that's what we want we don't need date created i am going to keep content uh i'm going to keep the content teaser some of the teasers are nonsense they're not actually even real sentences but some of them do look like they'd be useful so we're going to keep them we want the content we want the title content id all right good so we have that let's go through and see all right content title we're replacing that that's going to be the slug for now that's ok no we don't need to do that uh we we um yeah we determined yesterday that we for for these and for some things we don't need to change the title before we put it in as the slug right and in fact we don't even need to add a slug it will be automatically added all right so let's do this so we don't have to worry about that at all it really wouldn't matter either way but we'll let wordpress handle how to manipulate those slugs we're probably gonna have to manually change the slugs anyway um let me check my time here since all right about 10 minutes in about 10 minutes let me go back to the live chat i see there's more questions in there and i definitely want to get to them um all right we don't want the date anymore we are going to bring in the excerpts this is published title content all right great this is what we want we need to change the we need to change the name somewhere right where do i have it let's i don't want that right now why can i not find the place where i need there we are there it is all right so what are we going to call this post type um i i guess we're going to call it majors and departments i'm going to call it majors for now i'm going to call it majors it wouldn't be that much work to manually take a lot of the data out and maybe make another post type for departments and that might be something that i could get um someone else to do all right let's do that so we're gonna call this majors now we have to make a post type for that so let's really quickly copy and paste make a post type let's see so let's copy what we did yesterday and make majors so uh let's not copy that because we had everything uh singular and plural exactly the same this one would be better this all right so that's major and then all the plural we'll call majors and then down here we'll do the same all right so this is a bit of php this is a wordpress plugin so all we're doing here is making a new custom post type we're giving it some labels that will appear in the admin panel and then we're also just kind of telling it how it should act uh the type of fields that it should have available for users to edit and uh where it should appear we want to make sure it does appear in graphql so that it we're able to grab that data from graphql we're also telling it to appear in the rest api which right now we're using a little bit just to get a visual of what the data looks like but may not need that when we actually launch the site and all right so let's save that i'm going to copy it and let's go to our our wordpress installation login and go to our plugins and edit our plugins this isn't the only way we could edit the plugin but i haven't really set up any other way so this is how we're going to do it for right now oops it's the wrong plugin here's our custom plugin all right so we're going to paste the new stuff update if we have an error it should tell us automatically and so it doesn't have an error we do have this warning making changes active plugins is not recommended so we just did nothing broke this isn't really a live site on a live site probably wouldn't do that so now that that's there we should be able to run our migrate.js program and everything should migrate over yesterday i made some mistakes this doesn't work on the first try so we'll see see if i forgot anything this time um uh let's go node my grade.js yay cool it worked well i didn't realize there were that many in there all right cool we'll shut this program down uh remember we did it we do control c and that shut that down and now we can check our wordpress installation and what we should have is a place for majors and if we click on there hmm nothing's in there what happened let's double check our migrate.js file well it said it was inserted but it obviously was not um maybe it's not supposed to be plural let's give that another shot there we are okay this so the problem was um i supposed to use the singular major instead of the plural majors um all right all right two more minutes i'm gonna get to the live chat answer some questions let's see what we have header yeah i don't i don't really want that right do you really want the header i don't know maybe it would be useful better right now to not delete if we don't have to i am interested to see what these quick links are all right so these are our relative links which that's that's good some of these are links to our uh we have a an outside like a thirdparty vendor that um called smart catalog that handles all of our our course descriptions and things so those links will still work all right it looks like these links will still work so maybe maybe we'll use them oops and the time's almost up so let's well well we'll see what time it is all right let me go to live chat we'll answer some questions uh while i'm answering the questions let me know if you want to continue on now and build out a page to put some of this data on i'm thinking what we might have to do is grab multiple pieces from here to build out the page um yeah we're going to have to build this differently than we built any of the other pages uh i think if we want to avoid having to like hand code anything or make yeah it'll be a little bit more work coming in but then i think it should make things go faster as we bring in the other folders for this so let's let's give it a shot but let me know if you'd rather wait and do that on a different stream and we've already been streaming it's about an hour and a half so it's gonna end up being really long i know it's getting late for some of you so anyway please put in the live chat now if you think we should just save this for tomorrow's stream or if we should keep going today um i i could do other one i'm okay with either one all right so let me go back up to where i left off and get these questions answered oops i'm going to do the short break but if i have to go over i'm fine with that i want to get these questions in oh evo says i have my first nonintern job interview next monday and i'm really stoked i am too that's really exciting um i don't know how many um like the details that you could give of that on the live stream but i'd i'd love to hear more details about like what's what's the job you know like uh and i give you know any help i'm happy to give it i um i've i've obviously interviewed before four jobs but i've also been on the other end interviewing developers so i don't know maybe i could be able to give you some advice if you want right i'm no expert i'm just happy for you and when i hope you get the job so i don't know how helpful i'd be but that's really cool definitely so when it's next monday all right you you have to if you get a chance uh after the interview uh come back in the live chat let us know how it went uh i'm gonna be waiting to hear uh if you can't make it to the live chat like let me know on twitter or something uh let's see vince says that's not regular html um the element not in the head and what is yeah there's weird stuff going on with this html uh harshit said that's the beauty of ektron yeah definitely um yeah this html is weird it's if we could see where's the business program yeah we should be able to see some of the weirdness going on here uh whoa this one's not too bad these are normal p tags you gotta be kidding me hey we finally got something with some good markup all right but but you're right we have been getting some weird markup we've had to do some weird stuff with data earlier like um changing the names of some of the tags with javascript in our components before we render anything using css to just hide stuff that's just weird and shouldn't be there so we we have to work with this now the plan long term is to clean all that up have separate fields in wordpress in our our post types for each piece of data and then to pull that in and it'll be so much nicer once we get that there'll be no need for anyone who deals with the data to really know html so it'll be all right but we're doing it this way to save time uh i i wish we had more people you know that that worked in my department that could do some of this you know i could bring it in set up the post type and then they could just work on data entry basically but we just don't have that right now especially like the students are still on on their break for christmas and so we don't we don't even have student workers really uh to work on this uh ego says uh and this is in regard to when i was saying that the current website's really slow so the new website anything should be an improvement so he said yeah if the previous was really bad then everything will be perceived as a huge improvement it will yeah but not by everyone there's a group of people at the university mostly faculty members that see any type of change is a bad thing especially if it's a change in technology so i'm sure that we'll have some complaints when it comes to that but this site's not for an internal audience it's for an external audience so if anybody internally complains about it i'll just remind them that well that's that you're not really the audience the audience are high school students mainly so that's what we have to keep in mind is would a high school student look at this know what to do be attracted uh to this so hopefully they will be i'm sure they'll appreciate the increase in speed uh sj says normally never catch this live usually watch the recordings the next day sj i'm i'm really happy you got to catch this live uh welcome welcome to the live chat and uh thank thanks for watching um let's see uh sj says uh wanted to let you know yesterday when you had the weird slug it was because you highlighted the hyphen from the beginning of the slug and physically dragged it to the end of the slug oh no and i didn't even know i didn't catch that well thank you sj for bringing it up because i had no idea why it happened and then why it was fixed so it must have just um maybe automatically been fixed because i didn't save it and then when i went to a different post it just reverted that's probably what happened so wow good catch on that that must have been that's a small detail but i really appreciate you coming in the live chat and and telling me now i'm not going to be worried about bringing in the slugs and stuff that you know because that was you know entirely my fault all right cool believe i made it silly mistake and didn't notice it like that but i really appreciate you saying that um vince says and says ello you mean i don't have to worry about running out of the black pieces of paper with the patterns on them i don't remember what i said i don't i don't remember what i said for that response so uh vince let me know what i was talking about let's see uh vince says i'm new here oh no you're talking about light bright that's it okay took me a little while to figure out what's going on so yeah if anybody actually used light bright when you were a kid you remember like you had the so you had the the box right and there was a light bulb literally a light bulb in that box and then this black um piece of plastic with all the holes in it and then you would take a black piece of paper that had a pattern on it and it i think it had little letters to let you know what color to put in there and you stuck that on the grid and then you pushed little plastic uh pegs in there and the light would shine and the plastic was like semitransparent right so you'd push the pegs in there and it would shine with all these different colors right but if you use the paper once it's done for basically because you're not going to remember all the colors and everything um but anyway so that's that's how light bright worked if you're not familiar with light bright but john's version uh done in reacts um on codepen is entirely reusable it's awesome let's see uh guitar 6029 says hello would you say react is more popular than angular yeah that's a big debate uh i can only give you my personal opinion i don't really know numbers for sure you know but i'll say this react is for sure growing in popularity at a faster rate than angular is i see like just looking at job i look at job postings a lot uh i think it's a great way to try to keep your skills in line with what companies really want a lot of like bigger comp it's this is just my perception from what i've seen so just you know realize that it this is just me talking here the bigger companies that switched to angular when angular was a big deal like i don't know let's say like five six years ago or something um you know they made the switch to angular that takes a lot of work to make the switch they're not really as quick to switch to react now smaller companies seem to be switching to react like obviously newer companies are seem to all be going with react uh all your startups and stuff and then smaller companies that maybe either didn't do angular are now doing react or maybe if they're just more open they don't have a huge code base and they're more open to switching it over it seems like they're going with with react more that's just my observation from from job listings right but um i don't really know of any like specific numbers just to like well how many sites use angular versus reactor how many companies use it so i'm not sure uh if i had to pick one that that has more momentum i i'd put my money on react for sure it just seems like you see so much more about react out there uh being talked about on twitter um you know in in blogs and stuff so it's not like react is out or angular's out of the picture you know it's definitely not it's a big player a lot of people use angular but reacts just got a lot of momentum right now and it has for a couple years now anyway hopefully that's a good answer um i'm not i i'm a big believer in and say the idea that there's a lot of different ways to solve a problem and you know not not one one way isn't the way to solve every single problem so for me react is helping me solve a lot of problems right now um but it totally fine with using other tools other solutions or if other people look at the same problem use a different solution it's fine with me at the end of the day if you fulfill all the user stories all the requirements for the project and you know you've really designed something that provides a great user experience doesn't really matter what you used right it doesn't matter as long as you you don't want good code then that's that's fine everything else is cool to debate but from a user's point of view it doesn't matter at all and usually from a client's point of view it doesn't matter at all so don't feel bad no matter what you're using as long as you're producing good work i i mean you're where you need to be right if you're out looking for a job and you need to know like who's hiring what skills do i need that's a different story um but if you're already making money and doing good work then you know i'd say don't don't worry about what the next best thing is um let's see philip says i'll say javascript is the most popular yeah yeah guitar says everyone is jumping on frameworks but never learning javascript um yeah i would say um there's some truth to that uh i i see that that's sent that statement kind of repeated um in a lot of different places so i i agree my my take on this is when you're first starting out yes learn your basics of javascript right but you shouldn't try to master javascript before you go into a framework uh here's why assuming that you're trying to make money while you're doing this and you're not a fulltime student that can afford to just take your time you're gonna miss out on a lot of money if you force yourself to just use javascript uh and don't jump in on um some type of framework and just because you go to a framework doesn't mean you stop learning javascript my path if i was going to give advice as to a path to take is learn your basic javascript enough to be able to understand what's going on in the framework then start learning the framework but also keep learning javascript at the same time then you'll get the best of both worlds then you'll get to learn the framework you'll start working on projects like that if it's an indemand framework you could probably get a job or start making money at least freelance with it and you keep building up your javascript skills i learned a lot of new es6 stuff when i switched to react because it was being used in react there's a lot of things that i never had to do a lot of javascript stuff i never had to use until i started using react uh so switching to react actually helped me and pushed me to learn more javascript uh so i think that's it's good to keep in mind that it's not like either or right you can do both at the same time if you know if you do it right you can do both at the same time so that's my official advice um but yeah i mean i agree someone shouldn't just start out day one with react right day one you start out should be plain javascript stuff um for sure you need some foundation uh but just don't feel like you need to wait you know for a really long time before you switch it's it's not going to hurt your skills you can keep on learning uh javascript and a framework and whatever else you want at the same time so i mean that's my opinion based on my experience so i'm not going to hate on anybody that has a different opinion all right let's see john hanson says doesn't graphql allow you to make better queries that pull only the data you need even if categorized in many folders to use it's supposed to work better than just rest api yes yeah for sure um yeah graph graphql will let us grab exactly the data that we want and that's what we'll end up i think we'll end up having a lot of really detailed queries for some of these pages where we need to grab a lot of different you know parts of pieces of of data so we'll have to figure that we're going to have to learn more about querying with graphql as as we go on um and as some of you already know a lot about it i'm for sure going to have to learn more though um vince says how do you bill for a job like this it looks like they gave you a password to their database with very little information about the database architecture is it hourly all right so uh i'm on a salary so i am a fulltime friend and developer for university and i'm on a salary so i'm not billing for this if i was doing this freelance hourly would probably be the way to go if i were to give like a lump sum here's how long how much the project it would be huge it would be a big amount because of the amount of like just not knowing right so the reason i don't know anything about this database structure is because no one here knows anything about the database structure the site was was built by a company that we hired to build it and so so we don't know there was really only one person ever maintaining anything on the back end who they don't work here anymore and they didn't use any type of version control for us to be able to go back and see like you know what happened here so if you look back on the stream um we've kind of looked at the back end of this thing we've looked at the database we've tried to figure out what's going on even into like some of the templates that were used it's all detective work right now we're all like always just searching like how is this going on so yeah it's it's a little bit frustrating that we have to spend so much time just trying to figure out where this data is and how it was categorized and things like that but i mean that's that's the job that's what we have to do um so that's why i really want to put thought into how we're pulling this data in because i don't want the next person to have to deal with the same problem right i want to have some logic to the way we structure things and then that you know this will never have to happen again uh vince says in the description it says front end developer at work but there's an awful lot of back end stuff going on here i know it can't be avoided but avoiding this is the reason i want to do front end um yeah vince i i agree to so when i first started doing this stream about i don't know eight eight nine months ago something like that i really did do more front end uh my title is front end developer realistically i've started doing a lot more back end stuff as the year has gone on um you know potentially depending on the company i i maybe could be considered full stack it just depends on you know how titles are in this industry like they're kind of loose and they're not really heavily regulated right you know any industry that has you know javascript ninja as a title you know like titles don't mean that much so maybe it would be worth changing up the description on the video a bit to reflect the fact that we don't just do frontend work you know sometimes you know we get really into back end work and there are some streams where it's just back end we don't do any front end so um that's a good point actually uh that's that's a really good point i think i can't do anything about my title um but i can definitely change the description to more accurately reflect the work that we do on the stream um let's see evo says currently my third year of school but my capacities are hardly reached at school so i decided to seek a development job cool um evo says the job is at a communication company whose campaign who campaigns for multinationals my task will either be back end or front end with angular i will hear the details next monday all right very cool very cool i hope it works out for you and then you'll know angular you you'll be like my my person that knows angular on the stream so if we have to work with that i i can ask you all the angular questions let's see um alexi says are you okay you look kind of tired i feel kind of tired i feel tired i had um i mean i guess i went to sleep at an okay hour but um my um my youngest son was up last night and so i had to get up and um uh get him a drink or something yeah i think he did he wanted to drink and he just wouldn't quit crying without a drink it was like he's really cute but at in the middle of the night like you're just so tired so i i got up and got him a drink he went back to sleep so kind of had interrupted sleep so maybe that's why i'm tired i didn't have as much caffeine as i normally do today too so that could be it so i apologize um i had like an energy drink before the stream because i know it's no fun for you all if i seem like really tired and depressed during the stream so i try to stay upbeat but uh i think i'm okay like i'm not um my eyes feel tired but otherwise my body's like okay thanks for asking though i appreciate the concern uh evo says the only thing i am currently struggling with are questions for my interview but i guess that is just due to lack of understanding as to how they go to work on projects yeah um do you know at all evo if they're gonna ask you like technical questions like algorithms and stuff to solve because there are some websites that are that help you to practice for that kind of thing um so yeah i mean you they may not have told you ahead of time but i can i could give you some links or something to websites that will help with that uh vince says that's how real life worked back in the day light behind the black piece of paper and you poke holes in the color effect yeah yes vince don't worry about i i played with light bright back in the day that's how i totally remember that i love light bright they look so cool did they still sell those i don't know i think maybe i'll i want to get it for my kids but my daughter cordelia is like a year and a half old and i'm i she would definitely try to eat it she would try to eat the little pegs uh and if not eating it she would just throw them around so we'd probably lose the pegs maybe i'll wait until she's a little bit older because otherwise we would just lose all the colored pegs in a week um rumble bros says i'm having a hard time between going full stack or becoming a back end developer only i know doing full stack beads sorry i know doing full stack means i'll have more chances but specialization is also a good thing um rumble bros i'd say um think about if if you don't i'd say this if you're okay financially and can wait a little bit before like getting a good uh dev job then do what you really like to do the most if you really like back end and you don't care for front end stuff stick with back end and specialize get really good at that um if you really need a job and you think going full stack will will give you a better chance of getting a better job maybe making more money then go with that uh you can always you know maybe get to a point later on where you know you have a job you've been there for a year or two and you're comfortable financially and then you can start looking around for a job that you know you something you really want to do um i'm i don't know my my dad always told me you know you just sometimes you just have to get a job it doesn't matter if you like it or not he would say if it was fun they wouldn't call it work so i still have that in me a little bit that's like sometimes you just have to do what you have to do to pay the bills um so i always keep that in mind just kind of be really practical and realistic about that you know do that but then keep working towards your goal of what you really want to do so i don't know if that really helps you you know in terms of an answer but i mean i do know that jobs for full stack developers usually pay more than for front end or back end so if if you're really looking for for an increase in pay or something full stack is probably where you want to go um but it may not be worth it if you really don't like doing the front end stuff all right sj says i've never heard of light bright does that mean i'm young um blake's never heard of it either oh man no you you all never heard of light bright we we have to we have to do something about that we need light bright um let's see if we can get the library commercial all right here's light bright you're not going to be able to hear the sound but this is the original 1970s light break commercial now i mean i i wasn't around in the 1970s i remember using light bright in the late 80s early 90s but that's that's late right and now i'll have to go in and uh check so the the free code camp youtube channel history will now have the library thing in there um let's see so if you've never used light bright go check out john's uh version of light bright and use it and then if you really really like it you could probably find a light bright maybe they still make them if not maybe you could get an old one on ebay i should get a real light bright and have it right behind me like on this shelf and then i could write different things that would be cool um all right back to the live chat uh vince says graphql has to be supported server side doesn't it does ektron support graphql as far as i know ektron doesn't support graphql or much of anything but we're pulling it into wordpress and we have a plugin called wp graphql that does all the work for us to make graphql work with wordpress so that saved us a lot of time and uh the guy um jason yeah what's his last name i can't remember his last name but jason who created that plugin has actually been with us on the live chat several times and helped us work through how to set it up so really good plugin and it it did save us because i mean i i wouldn't want to have to do all the php work to make graphql work with wordpress i'm just i don't know a lot about php and i'm not really interested in learning more about it right now there's nothing wrong with php but i just want to focus on getting better at javascript um let's see alexis says do you like front end more than back end um i don't know that's stuff quick i i guess i like front end right now more than back end uh because all right it's easier for me because that's where i started out at and you immediately get to see the results and show other people the results and they can say like oh that's cool if you try to explain what you've done on the back end of people who don't really know about it um they don't really understand what's going on and and they so i don't know like it's just you get more positive feedback and things from from people with frontend uh stuff so i don't know but i it's not like i dislike back end like trying to choose between the two is is really tough for me right now it's like asking me what child i like the best right um yeah so i i like both maybe one day i'll make up my mind about which one i really like the best but i can't right now i like working with both um let's see uh alexis says i get started using react and i have no idea what i'm doing i'm more of a back end guy yeah that's how it is i think depending on where you started the you know moving to the other side of things is always like more difficult so like for me front end seems easy and back end seems hard but for a back end person sometimes front end seems hard like i i have an uncle that's been a software developer for i don't know since like the late 70s or something and he does a lot of stuff with c sharp and well when we talk and i'm telling him about some of the stuff i'm doing he's always like really impressed i'm like listen you've been doing this for so long you know i i've got nothing on you and uh but he said he said no like i work with the back end stuff this stuff's all new to me and it's all you know impressive so i kind of like that just to keep that in mind sometimes i i don't like the tendency for like some types of programmers to look down on other types of programs to say that stuff's easy right back end people say oh well the front end you know that's easy stuff uh or whatever um because really it's nothing's easy in in coding in programming right it all takes hard work and it takes hard work to be really good at it so it's just different for different types so there are certain things that you have to worry about in front end that you don't have to worry about back end and vice versa so anyway that's that's how i feel about it evo says not the angular questions we may not ever do anything angular on on this stream so you might not get the questions um james ross says have you ever considered gunner glasses or flux um for your eyes you know what i used to use flux huh i have considered the glasses i saw some i follow a lot of coders on instagram and i saw some of them had had just purchased some of those glasses or they got it as a present or something for christmas and i just got to thinking about them does anybody use those or know about them are they really helpful for eyestrain like i my my office is always dark i keep the lights dim and it cuts down on glare on my screens i try not to keep my screens too bright to help out with it but like i can tell like right now my eyes are fatigued um i'm on a screen i mean you all know how it is like we're looking at a screen all day you know we and even when we're not working you know you got phones you got televisions right i mean we got a nintendo switch for christmas so like i'm up at night trying to sneak in some time with uh the new zelda game while my kids are sleeping um yeah so if they're if they work i'd i'd be interested in getting some i never wore glasses though it might drive me crazy to actually have them i i mean i guess would be like sunglasses so it wouldn't be too bad uh umberto says i loved magna doodle yeah magnadoodle was cool i was never good with magnadoodle i like to do it but some people drew like amazing things with magnadoodles uh it just takes like a lot of coordination and patience though let's see uh evo says i didn't hear anything about technical questions from my recruiter but i wouldn't be scared about those i usually estimate my capacities as somebody with one year working experience thanks for the offer though oh cool yeah no problem like i said i don't know how much i could help you out anyway i'm just excited um james ross says light bright is extreme choking hazard yeah my my little one cordelia is my youngest right a year and a half she's so cute but she's the ornish little baby and man it's just like she'll put some in her mouth that she's not supposed to walk up to you and open her mouth and let you see it and then run away like she's daring you like hey look what i have i'm not supposed to have it come chase me right it's just but she just looks so cute when she does it you can't get mad that's like i i love that little girl she's she just like i spoil her so much i can i she she wants me all the time this morning when i drop my wife had to drop me off at work because my car is not working right now um so cordelia was in the car and i waved goodbye to her as soon as the car drove off she just started crying and screaming that was like the worst thing it just broke my heart but just she wants she wants to be around all the time uh anyway sorry for the side to the side i mean anybody if you ever had a little one or something i mean i'm sure you you understand um but it's just crazy how that little person there just you know you do anything for them and they you know they're they're like kind of helpless without you but anyway not coding related sorry um let's see sin says go see hyper js this is super hot what type of js i i haven't heard of hyper js rumble rose says that's basically the same thing i've been thinking i've been doing lots of back end work for my own business for the last two years so i've got lots of projects built for a portfolio that's cool i mean having a good portfolio is where it's at i mean that's what people are looking for what projects have you done if when we hire people here that's all i want to know i could care less about your resume i only read the cover letter to make sure that people are literate and i i want to know like where's the projects let me see them let me see the code oh cool jeff miller says that they do still make light rights and uh his daughter got one a few years ago awesome i'm gonna have to check in on that not right now i i i'd like to get one for my office i wonder if they make little ones that would be safe because cordelia is rarely in my office all right youtube said i thought i clicked this to see some coding oh yeah youtube uh usually at the end of the stream we do question and answers so like the first hour we do mostly like coding and then the second hour is mostly question and answer i was thinking about doing some more stuff with this today but i i don't know because the stream is getting really long now um which is fine the question answer is good um so we might not do any more code if you want to see the code part um check out the recording of the video and and just watch like the first hour um well i take it back skip the first 15 minutes because we had technical difficulties and then watched the the next hour after that vince says i've been around long enough to remember watching that commercial on tv uh sj says yeah i was born in the late 80s yeah i was born in 85 so i i still like vaguely remember 80s stuff and really like most of my childhood that i remember was from the 90s uh vince says uh this is in response to alexi i started out as a backend database developer before i knew anything about the web and i definitely like front end better i'm sure opinions differ okay that's that's interesting all right so vince started with back end moves to front end and likes front end so yeah i think it's good to try both and see what you like and then different people are just gonna you know prefer front end or back end or like both all right james ross says which of your children is your favorite he said okay it's cordelia i don't i love they're all so different it's crazy that they're all like they all had like the same set of genes going in right and now they're all so different um so yeah it depends i mean depending on how a certain child is acting i may not like them that much at that moment but overall you know i just have a great time with them and uh even as they get older they change so much all they all have different personalities so you know it's just so hard to make that make that call my wife is different though my wife will tell me like this is my favorite child right now you know she knows exactly and it's usually based on which child gave her a hard time that day and whichever one didn't is the favorite one john hanson says a good perspective jesse problem solving is the key to all sides of coding all are good and important cool thank you i'm glad you agree uh john hanson says they do make a travel size light bright oh that's going on my amazon wishlist right after this stream for sure um cat d says what if your portfolio is a todo app project and a hello world project uh cat it's better than nothing to i here's what i think some people say don't put like the you know your your projects like your tutorial projects on github but but here's what i think if that's all you have put it on github because it proves that you've actually done some coding later on when you get some real projects then you might want to make those projects private or take them off github i i really don't even worry about it to me here's the way i feel if i see somebody that wants to work here and they have real projects mixed in with tutorials that tells me that they're continuing to learn right and they're not too good for tutorials anymore all right and i like that i appreciate that because if i find a dev that isn't learning anymore i don't want to work with that dab no matter how good they are right now in two years they're going to be terrible because they won't have kept up with anything so so cat go with that if you can but try try your best to get some some other projects on there you know as soon as you can you know before you really start trying to apply for places and they don't have to be paying projects they could just be some side project that you really like or you could try to contribute to other people's projects so like you can contribute to the projects that we work on i try to make some issues like easy for beginners to just learn the process of submitting a pull request on github so if you're interested in doing that let me know you can message me on twitter or something and i could help get you some more info i mean if you already know how to do it that's cool i don't want to assume that you don't but if you need more help let me know um or find some other uh project that you really like and see if there's something you can contribute to because employers will see that too you know they'll see a record of your contributions even if it's not your own project hopefully that helped let me know if that was wasn't helpful or if it was confusing or anything and i'll try to clarify vince says um if you're curious originally oracle um pl sql developer for phone company oh interesting interesting i've never done anything with oracle uh sj says i actually have special lighting in my office that's specifically designed for offices where the computer users spend hours on the computer it's really good for the eyes oh that's that's actually pretty cool maybe i'll have to look into that i mean i really should think about this if i'm going to be a programmer for the next i don't know until i retire right um i should probably think about the effect it's going to have on my eyes long term uh hammond said please say something on full stack with react i have to finish a voting app for free code camp i know react but i'm confused to use react or not um yeah so i would say uh for react like you could do full stack javascript right so and you could use react on the front end and then node on the back end um react works a little bit serverside as well so um you can do serverside rendering with react and then serve those pages and then potentially do clientside routing and stuff uh you know once everything loads in the browser so you can do some things like that for your project i don't think that would be necessary to actually do serverside rendering unless you really wanted to but i definitely think it's it's uh a good idea to do full stack javascript all the way across it just makes sense you know you learn one language and you're able to do frontend and backend i think that's cool if you got to learn something else for a project that's fine too right like we use php sometimes but if if you're trying to learn and start out and being able to do things then you'll save a lot of time by learning javascript and being able to write it on the front end of the back end so um i mean if you have the time and you'd like to learn more about react it might be really cool to try to do that voting app with react and set up the back end with node um if you're more comfortable with something else though and you just need to get it done then you know go with that i don't think there's any real reason why you really really would want to use react for that but i i really like using it i think it's improved the quality of my work uh and i think it's fun to to work with once you you know once you get the hang of it i really enjoy it vince says it looks like you're about to wrap up and i have to go anyway i enjoy this though i'll look for your live stream again if i can thanks oh you're welcome vince thanks so much i really enjoyed talking with you uh on the live chat um so yeah hopefully you can come back for another uh another stream sometime uh hamlet said i saw some tutorials uh they use two servers it's confusing yeah yeah uh we use two servers sometimes for some of the things we do so basically you'd have um a backend server that's node.js and it it handles um it can handle things like like routing um uh data like grabbing data from a form or something and sending it off emailing it or you know using it with an api and then you would have another server that would just run your react app so usually like if you have an api or something then you know you want to run that as a separate server you don't have to i suppose um trying to think out like you could let me say this way you could have all the code in one project right all one one github project but you would still want to run that separately right like you want run something on let's say port 3000 that would be like your react app and then on port 8080 you'd run your api and then like locally you could just hit that api you know on that port and then when you actually go to put that into a production setting right you would still run you know your server on on a separate port right and then you could just hit that from within the same server if you wanted to and then have like your clientside stuff or your react stuff publicly available hopefully that's not super confusing but i would say like yeah having two servers um when you need like a back end in the front end is not unheard of let's see oh cool cat d says yes very thankful thanks all right all right uh cool i'm glad i could uh glad i could help all right so i've gotten to the end of the live chat i definitely don't really want to go any longer with this because we're already over two hours uh with the stream um which is fine but i think it's really intimidating for people to see a video that's two hours long and say like wow i'm not gonna sit through two hours so um i like to keep it somewhere between one and two hours and don't go much over um let's see he says oh emmanuel said i don't understand right let let me know what you don't understand i'm assuming that you're talking about like when i was talking about running two different servers uh let me know if that's the case and and i'll try to i can pull up a repo where i ran two different servers if if you want to see an example um let me i'm gonna yeah okay let me pull up a repository that i did actually run two servers with um so let's go to i don't think it's here let me get my profile um i'll make everything bigger so you can see it as soon as i find the repository and it was there we go all right so this was one of my projects that i did when i was doing the react nano degree um um oh you know what actually i think i had the server in two different spots so uh this project i was the first cohort to go through so they changed it a little bit when i first started this project they had the server separate uh and then a couple weeks later when i checked back again um they had changed it so server is actually in the same repo but at that point i was almost done with the project so i didn't switch it over so basically here's what you would do this is your react app right and if i go into source here you can see i have you know just like a normal index.js and everything and then over here this is the api server where all the data is so we have this server.js file so what you do is you start this up and then i'd be able to get posts i'd be able to create posts and have them stored here and i could get posts i could edit them but i still had to run this and let me see where i had see if it's my reducers no it's um utils so you can see where i'm hitting that api oops i forgot to make the text uh font size bigger sorry about that all right so here like we're hitting that api so i'm running the server on localhost 3001 i'm hitting that api to get the data um so like this just grabs all the posts um this one gets posts from a certain category this one actually gets just one post based on an id this one obviously deletes a post so you can see like we're hitting that api that other separate server um from this app this app would run you know its own on its own server right so or you know in this case on its own port on on localhost so i think this one would probably run on 3000 and then we had the api running on 3001. uh so this is not unlike what you would do in a lot of production apps i mean um like right now we we're getting the data from the from wordpress through graphql so that runs on it it's a whole separate thing um and then in react which we're running locally we're grabbing that data right so we have two set up there if you were to do javascript full stack you would have the same setup you would make some sort of an api to manage your content and that would be running and then you would have somewhere else probably a react app that would run and it would run um so that clients could could hit that you know with their browsers um you know users but it would grab the data from the api um so i mean i think it's it's a common thing uh but just when we're talking about javascript and doing it all in javascript it can be confusing like why do we need uh two different you know two different ones so anyway that's why do you absolutely need two different servers probably not i mean think about you just think about the way wordpress works normally normally you do everything just in in wordpress itself it hits the database you use php to put together everything and then it spits out markup to the client right um but a lot of sites now are drawing data from separate apis so anyway so that's that's kind of what i was trying to explain all right emmanuel says okay i think i grasp it now we'll read more on it all right cool cool yeah thanks for the question too because i'm sure there are others that are either watching now or will watch later that probably were confused too i'm sure i didn't do a great job explaining it but hopefully that maybe just helps you out a little bit and now you'll know like what to look up uh to read more about it all right so i am going to uh stop streaming now see tomorrow's all right i'm pretty sure i don't have anything lined up for tomorrow so i should be able to stream sometime around 1 p.m eastern time and we'll most likely be coming back here working on the same project again uh we'll see how much i get done between now and then maybe we'll pick up at the same same spot um let's see oh emmanuel said oh you did a great job that's why i i have to stay stay with you all right cool says thanks so much you're welcome you're welcome i appreciate you saying that um just i'm glad i could help all right so i am yeah i'm gonna wrap things up i'll be back tomorrow and uh until then uh thanks for watching have a great day you
