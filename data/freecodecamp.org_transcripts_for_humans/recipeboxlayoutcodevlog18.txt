00:00 - this week I'm taking you to the kitchen
00:01 - because I'll be implenting the layout of
00:04 - recipe box app
00:11 - [Applause]
00:15 - [Music]
00:56 - I was wondering about using material
00:58 - design and file materialized CSS would
01:02 - be quite nice for that I think that
01:05 - especially if you do the project for
01:06 - yourself if it's not for a client um you
01:09 - can easily change some stuff um if it's
01:13 - a better for the project if it's better
01:15 - for the final user if it's better for
01:17 - the final performance this situation is
01:19 - a great example uh when uh fastly
01:23 - designing it I thought I will build
01:25 - everything with flexbox but later when
01:27 - you um think okay what about fob what
01:29 - about this uh um these animations uh is
01:33 - it easier is better to build them on
01:36 - your own uh is it the challenge that you
01:39 - need right
01:40 - now because if not maybe there's an
01:43 - easier and faster way to build it of
01:45 - course it would be perfect if you know
01:46 - everything in the beginning but that's
01:48 - life and the life is that sometimes you
01:54 - you get the new idea out of a sudden and
01:58 - uh if it's really bad for a project why
02:01 - not turn into this direction if it was
02:04 - the project for a client for sure I
02:06 - would have to discuss everything with
02:08 - them and explain why uh and convince
02:12 - them to this solution uh convince them
02:15 - to choosing some you know slightly
02:18 - different way communication and being on
02:20 - the same page as the key
02:34 - [Music]
03:00 - he
03:02 - [Music]
03:25 - [Music]
03:37 - this is what I did uh this week with the
03:40 - recipe box project I introduced um the
03:44 - basic layouts let's start with the
03:47 - homepage I implemented it according to
03:50 - the designs I prepared earlier right now
03:52 - you see one photo but of course there
03:54 - will be different photos each of the
03:57 - card is the link
04:00 - there's the FB where you can always add
04:02 - a new recipe this is mobile horizontal
04:06 - View mobile vertical view on smaller
04:09 - phones such as iPhone
04:12 - 5 it looks like
04:18 - that iPad View and iPad horizontal
04:25 - View and desktop view each of the
04:30 - the card is a link so wherever you click
04:34 - in the area of a given recipe you will
04:37 - be redirected to recipe view this is the
04:42 - recipe view on desktop so there when you
04:45 - enter any um any recipe you can see it
04:49 - details so the big photo and you can
04:52 - also add it or delete the
04:56 - recipe the the TX here I change it a bit
05:00 - from the previous design a user will be
05:02 - able to search here and also uh come
05:07 - back to the previous page on mobile it
05:10 - looks like that so it's almost full
05:13 - width of the screen and
05:17 - mobile
05:20 - horizontally and let's look at some iPad
05:24 - view whenever a
05:26 - user clicks addit then we go to edit
05:31 - view of the
05:33 - recipe uh where uh we have uh the title
05:38 - to edit the text to delete or to add a
05:41 - new
05:48 - tag there is also a place where you can
05:51 - addit the
05:54 - ingredients and instructions
06:03 - later a user will be able to save uh the
06:06 - changed recipe or resign from the
06:09 - changes by clicking cancel also here
06:12 - there's a chance to change the
06:15 - photo and the last view implemented so
06:17 - far is the create view where a user
06:20 - wants to introduce completely new uh
06:23 - recipe by clicking the fob with plus
06:26 - icon they will be redirected here and
06:29 - the form is with float label pattern H
06:32 - so the labels do not disappear when you
06:35 - start
06:38 - typing but they will stay at the top the
06:41 - whole thing here is a link so it's not
06:45 - important in which point the user clicks
06:47 - wherever they click in this area they
06:50 - will be redirected to uploading a photo
06:54 - this is the mobile
06:56 - view and bigger mobile view so tablets
06:59 - so I introduced the basic layout and
07:02 - right now all of the views are in
07:03 - separate HTML files if you want to have
07:06 - a look at the code uh I will put their
07:08 - repository Link in the video description
07:11 - below when I come back to this project I
07:14 - will start adding react functionality I
07:17 - started with implementing the layout
07:19 - once again because I think it's easier
07:21 - for me to do first the basic View and
07:25 - later uh to see how it works uh while I
07:29 - start implementing react the separation
07:31 - into implementing layout and uh
07:34 - functionality in react helps me also in
07:38 - deciding on the final version of the
07:41 - design and on the final version of the
07:44 - look of the product and test whether the
07:47 - first decisions when it comes to layout
07:50 - were really the appropriate ones that's
07:53 - it for this week when it comes to coat
07:55 - because Christmas time is coming this
07:58 - week we are from in Christmas time and
08:02 - uh whether you are believer or not I
08:04 - wish you really the best time in the
08:06 - year and relaxing a bit reinking also
08:10 - what you did in this year and what you
08:12 - want to do in the following year that's
08:15 - some people who do not believe in New
08:17 - Year's resolution but uh I will tell you
08:21 - on my example how it worked last year in
08:24 - December I planned few things when it
08:26 - comes to code one of them was learning
08:28 - JavaScript
08:30 - the second was writing more blog posts
08:32 - about code and the third was learning
08:36 - more about user experience and thanks to
08:39 - this planning and thanks to having some
08:42 - expectations uh I really developed
08:46 - without the plan I don't suppose I would
08:48 - get the same results there are at least
08:51 - three things I learned about learning to
08:53 - go this year the first one is to be
08:56 - careful about your choices and abundance
08:59 - of things because there are many of
09:01 - courses but if you don't stay focused
09:04 - you can really get distracted and learn
09:06 - simply nothing the second thing is to
09:10 - refill your motivation everybody will
09:13 - have different way of motivating
09:15 - themselves but for me uh this blog
09:17 - turned out to be one of the great
09:19 - sources of motivation and the third
09:22 - thing I learned is taking small steps
09:25 - into the right direction so whenever
09:29 - appears an occasion to learn something
09:31 - new uh that's connected with your goals
09:34 - that is according to what you want to
09:36 - achieve uh generally go for it but don't
09:40 - exaggerate with the size of the project
09:43 - don't exaggerate with the responsibility
09:44 - don't exaggerate with
09:47 - the with the complexity and doing
09:50 - everything at once because whenever we
09:52 - want to make something life and
09:56 - implement it but we don't divide it into
09:58 - small steps
10:00 - uh or whenever we want to learn
10:01 - something new but we don't do it step by
10:04 - step but uh want to take the big bite it
10:07 - can overwhelm you that's why take the
10:12 - small steps hopefully the next year we
10:15 - will learn together even more than this
10:18 - year and we will keep on doing keep on
10:22 - developing I wish you that and I wish
10:24 - you back free Cod and awesome designs
10:28 - [Music]
10:36 - Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
10:39 - keep on cing and see you next year
10:44 - [Music]
