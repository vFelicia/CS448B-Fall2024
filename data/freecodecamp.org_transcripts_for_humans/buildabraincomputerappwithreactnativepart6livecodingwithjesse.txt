00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:07 - with jesse i'm jesse and
00:10 - i'm i'm excited to be here today i miss
00:13 - streaming
00:14 - i
00:15 - think the last time i streamed was a
00:16 - week ago
00:18 - so and i know the last time i streamed i
00:20 - had mentioned that i would like to do it
00:22 - like every other day and i definitely
00:24 - did not do it every other day so
00:26 - apologies for that
00:28 - i really i think what happened was uh
00:33 - after my last time that i streamed
00:37 - shortly after that
00:40 - maybe like just the reality of
00:42 - everything that's going on hit me
00:44 - and i just i got like super depressed
00:46 - and i had a lot of like anxiety and
00:48 - stuff
00:49 - so
00:51 - pretty much like just getting through
00:53 - the the normal week of uh working
00:57 - my normal job
00:59 - was about as much as i could do working
01:01 - my normal job trying to be there for my
01:03 - kids and my wife like
01:05 - i just had no energy there were a couple
01:07 - times when i tried to stay up late and
01:09 - do a stream and i just sat at the
01:11 - computer
01:13 - and
01:14 - just couldn't couldn't do it like
01:15 - couldn't start the stream just was too
01:17 - exhausted so
01:20 - i'm feeling pretty good today though had
01:22 - some good weather
01:23 - been trying to do some workouts at home
01:25 - hopefully i'll be i'll be all right but
01:27 - we have some good news so
01:30 - one piece of good news is the app got
01:32 - accepted to the google play store so on
01:35 - the last stream we did um
01:38 - we did submit it to the google play
01:39 - store so we're in
01:41 - so now um
01:42 - i just just brought up the dashboard
01:45 - here so evidently yesterday i acquired
01:48 - seven new users
01:49 - and i lost four
01:51 - so
01:53 - i'm guessing is that like a net then of
01:55 - three users
01:57 - one of them is me
01:58 - so
02:00 - uh i do know that uh some people
02:02 - downloaded it and then didn't realize
02:04 - they need to have the neurocity notion
02:06 - headset
02:07 - so
02:08 - it's uh
02:10 - understandable that people would delete
02:12 - it immediately
02:14 - but
02:15 - i downloaded on my device it worked
02:19 - pretty sweet
02:20 - you can see it here it is like in the
02:22 - app store on google play i'll post a
02:24 - link in the chat
02:26 - that way if anybody wants to check it
02:28 - out
02:29 - you can actually maybe i should put this
02:31 - link in the description to the video too
02:33 - if i remember to do that later on i'll
02:35 - do that um
02:38 - just a reminder too i've been putting
02:39 - out some tutorial videos on my own
02:41 - youtube channel links in the description
02:43 - uh please check those out if you want a
02:45 - lot of times
02:47 - the questions that i get frequently in
02:48 - the chat i will take those and turn them
02:51 - into tutorial videos uh so
02:54 - that
02:54 - you know if you have any questions about
02:56 - some of the stuff that i'm doing on the
02:58 - stream i may have already done a video
03:00 - to answer it uh and if you have any
03:02 - ideas of tutorial videos you'd like for
03:04 - me to do put them in the stream i keep a
03:06 - list
03:09 - of all the topics that i want to do so
03:11 - anytime anybody gives me a topic
03:14 - if it's something that i think is
03:15 - possible for me to do i put it on the
03:17 - list and
03:19 - when i have time i try to go through it
03:21 - and do some videos
03:23 - alright so
03:25 - see a lot of people in the chat saying
03:26 - hello hey everybody
03:29 - thanks for joining me
03:33 - today
03:35 - if you don't know yet
03:37 - we are going to
03:39 - submit our app to the apple app store
03:43 - we're going to build it first which more
03:46 - good news
03:47 - you can actually build using expo which
03:49 - we are using expo you can build for ios
03:52 - on a windows machine i did not know that
03:55 - earlier today i was on my my macbook and
03:58 - i was gonna go i was gonna build it on
04:00 - my macbook so it would be ready for the
04:01 - stream and i was going through the
04:03 - documentation and
04:05 - realized that i could just use expo so
04:09 - that's pretty awesome
04:10 - so that's what we're gonna do
04:12 - so we're going to make whatever changes
04:14 - we need to the code to get this
04:17 - ready to go
04:18 - we're going to do a build similar to
04:20 - what we did last time but this time
04:21 - we're going to build the type of file
04:23 - that we need to
04:25 - send to apple
04:27 - and then we're going to actually submit
04:29 - that to the apple app store so we'll
04:30 - take you through that whole process
04:33 - i don't know how long this is going to
04:34 - be remember the last time it took us
04:37 - like three hours to do the google play
04:39 - store
04:40 - so i'm hoping uh so some of the steps
04:43 - that we had to do then we won't have to
04:44 - do now
04:46 - so i think we can do it in way less than
04:48 - three hours uh but we'll see how it goes
04:51 - now one thing that we can't do
04:54 - that i'm slightly worried about is that
04:56 - we can't actually test on windows
05:00 - so um
05:03 - we might have to
05:06 - i don't know my wife has an iphone if we
05:08 - really need to test it and don't think
05:09 - it'll work on an iphone before we submit
05:11 - i could probably grab my wife's iphone
05:13 - and um maybe like download the expo app
05:16 - and just test it on her iphone first
05:19 - but other than that i think we should be
05:21 - good that's the only point of this whole
05:23 - thing that i think is going to be a
05:24 - problem now here's what i had to do
05:26 - before the stream to get ready for this
05:29 - i needed to
05:31 - create a developer account with apple
05:34 - alright and that is not cheap
05:36 - so it's a hundred dollars a year
05:38 - to create an account and uh i recommend
05:41 - like
05:42 - it said it could take up to 48 hours for
05:45 - the account creation process to
05:48 - to be complete
05:49 - so i'm glad i did it last night
05:52 - because
05:53 - uh it it could take a while
05:56 - thankfully though i got approved like
05:58 - very quickly i i think it was like less
06:00 - than an hour later i was approved
06:01 - something like that so
06:03 - i don't know
06:05 - i guess they just say 48 hours because
06:07 - you know maybe it's um
06:10 - potentially could take that long i don't
06:12 - know
06:13 - but
06:14 - that's already so that's definitely you
06:16 - you have to have that you can't submit
06:18 - to the app store without that so um
06:21 - you need to do that google play i
06:23 - believe is only like 25
06:25 - and that's it it's just a one-time fee
06:27 - so
06:28 - if you want to start out with putting
06:30 - apps on an app store and you don't have
06:31 - a lot of money
06:32 - to start out with definitely recommend
06:34 - doing it on android
06:37 - it's
06:38 - significantly cheaper to do it on
06:40 - android
06:46 - let's get started i can see one thing
06:49 - that we need to do already
06:51 - we uh we took out the ios for the
06:53 - platform here last time
06:55 - because we weren't using ios
06:58 - but
06:59 - uh we're going to do switch that up to
07:02 - ios
07:04 - and
07:05 - support tablet true yep
07:08 - no reason why we couldn't support tablet
07:10 - now we have
07:12 - android we have it we have a package of
07:14 - version code and permissions i don't
07:16 - know that we need to do that but we're
07:17 - gonna we'll scroll through the
07:18 - documentation i
07:20 - read it beforehand
07:22 - uh but we'll go through step by step now
07:25 - actually let me set my timer
07:28 - i'm gonna do a 25 25-minute timer of
07:30 - just going through the code in this case
07:32 - going through the documentation after 25
07:35 - minutes i'm going to
07:38 - uh go back to the chat and i'm going to
07:40 - read the comments and answer questions
07:43 - in the chat
07:44 - i'll try to keep an eye on it on the
07:46 - chat as well
07:47 - uh
07:49 - occasionally just to make sure
07:50 - everything is going all right in there
07:52 - try to keep everything positive
07:55 - and let's
07:57 - scroll down so here we go
07:59 - install all right we've already done
08:01 - this step
08:03 - our
08:04 - app.json there we go let's
08:07 - add this in
08:09 - our ios build number
08:12 - and
08:16 - let's just throw in the same thing that
08:18 - we have here
08:20 - we'll put it in here
08:22 - and
08:24 - that looks good 1.0 it looks looks good
08:27 - that doesn't really matter it's not like
08:30 - uh
08:31 - not too serious about build numbers at
08:33 - this point
08:34 - all right that looks good
08:41 - and
08:46 - i believe that is the minimum that we
08:48 - need
08:55 - all right and let's go i'm gonna split
08:57 - the uh the terminal here let me
09:00 - push this down i'm gonna split the
09:01 - terminal up
09:02 - so we can start we can do expo start
09:08 - we found out on the last stream that you
09:09 - can't do a build if you haven't actually
09:11 - started expo yet
09:12 - so we're running the expo start
09:15 - there's a new version
09:20 - i thought we installed a new version
09:22 - last time
09:30 - that's weird
09:32 - i like i really thought we installed the
09:34 - latest version
09:40 - let's let's do the install real quick
09:43 - while that's going
09:45 - we could figure out our next steps as
09:47 - well
09:51 - i was uh
09:53 - i just
09:54 - didn't anybody watch last time didn't we
09:56 - update that i seriously doubt in one
09:58 - week it's the version has increased that
10:00 - much
10:01 - uh but anyway we'll we'll double check
10:03 - version numbers and stuff
10:08 - unless i have the uh the version
10:12 - in the package json locked
10:16 - we'll see
10:19 - all right so we have skipped the android
10:20 - part
10:24 - for ios
10:26 - i need the apple id and password which i
10:28 - have
10:37 - all right so
10:38 - just like we had our android key store
10:40 - last time we're gonna have a
10:42 - distribution certificate
10:45 - and uh i'm just gonna let expo handle
10:48 - that
11:05 - it looks like we need to make a password
11:06 - for that
11:18 - all right we're not gonna worry about
11:19 - pushing okay notifications right now
11:22 - we'll probably add those into the app at
11:24 - some point if we keep going with it
11:26 - so um
11:30 - just kind of make a mental note of that
11:36 - cool
11:39 - it looks like we're good uh in terms of
11:41 - build let's let's double check now and
11:43 - see if we
11:45 - are on the right version
11:56 - all right cool so we did not get the
11:58 - message that we're out of date
12:01 - so that's good
12:02 - it must have worked okay so that is
12:05 - working
12:06 - and
12:10 - i'm going to double check the
12:12 - oops wrong wrong thing
12:17 - but double check the command
12:25 - expo build ios that's it
12:29 - so let's throw that in there expo build
12:32 - colon ios
12:34 - it should work
12:36 - according to what i've read this should
12:37 - work i'm still like somewhat amazed that
12:39 - this is going to work on windows now
12:42 - do you have the access to the apple
12:43 - account yes i do have access to that
12:47 - apple id
12:54 - password
13:06 - what
13:13 - hmm all right let's try it again
13:15 - like i'm almost positive that was my
13:18 - correct username and password
13:20 - so let's try it again
13:24 - yeah you know what
13:27 - on my other screen i'm gonna check it
13:29 - out
13:53 - actually you know i just got an email
13:54 - from the app store i'm gonna verify
13:57 - what my login is
14:04 - because i need to do this anyway
14:07 - all right this this looks like
14:13 - slogan
14:17 - yeah so i was able to log in to my
14:21 - developer account here so you can see
14:23 - i'm logged in
14:24 - so
14:25 - let's uh
14:28 - all right let's try
14:30 - let's try it again
14:54 - hmm
14:58 - all right i'm gonna try one more thing
15:18 - hmm
15:20 - all right let me look back here and see
15:24 - for sure what we need
15:27 - you need your apple id and password
15:36 - hmm
15:41 - i'm gonna
15:43 - try to log out and see
16:02 - hmm
16:10 - all right that worked all right let me
16:12 - try one more time maybe i'm just typing
16:15 - it in wrong
16:21 - what's the problem when you try to use
16:22 - like secure passwords that have a bunch
16:24 - of uh different characters in it i guess
16:27 - sometimes it's hard to type in
16:33 - all right is jesse weigel at gmail.com
16:38 - all right
16:42 - all right here i'm going to copy and
16:44 - paste what i just typed in
16:48 - and
16:48 - uh hopefully that'll work
16:56 - hopefully it lets me
16:58 - maybe it didn't
17:14 - i guess we could do
17:16 - let's run let's get rid of up on that
17:18 - and let's run this uh expo debug true
17:22 - and then we'll throw in the uh
17:25 - yarn
17:27 - um what was it was it build ios
17:37 - yeah build ios
17:40 - or it was expo build ios
17:54 - [Music]
17:59 - you
18:20 - authentication to developer portal
18:25 - failed
18:28 - all right well let's look up this error
18:30 - then
18:32 - debug mode didn't really give us
18:34 - anything
18:35 - extra huh
18:36 - all right
18:39 - let's look up the air see what we're
18:41 - getting here can't authenticate it's
18:43 - always good when you get something
19:10 - hmm
19:26 - hmm
19:28 - uh what we can try is uh we could try to
19:31 - put the
19:32 - password and stuff in a uh
19:38 - i believe we have the option to put it
19:40 - in an environment variable file
19:43 - so
19:43 - let's try that
19:48 - i'm going to look at the chat real quick
19:49 - to see if somebody else has any ideas
20:06 - okay
20:07 - um
20:09 - i remember seeing in the documentation
20:10 - somewhere earlier that you can use
20:24 - uh environment variables instead so let
20:27 - me
20:29 - just gotta figure out what the keys are
20:31 - for that
20:34 - hmm
21:09 - i don't know what else i guess i could
21:11 - go back real quick and see
21:21 - after entering credentials
21:41 - wait is this it
21:43 - 127 that was what we get right
21:45 - all right so this is the same
21:47 - error
22:00 - let's um let's turn on that windows
22:02 - linux subsystem
22:04 - i don't know if it actually has to be
22:06 - running in the background remember we
22:08 - installed that the last time
22:10 - so um
22:14 - there we go
22:18 - we'll run that
22:19 - and
22:35 - hmm
22:44 - all right well this person said they use
22:46 - pseudo and that helped
22:48 - and they got two thumbs up and that's
22:50 - the only
22:51 - solution that i saw any anybody give
22:54 - thumbs up to which is
22:56 - usually a good sign so let's just try
22:58 - that because that's a very easy
23:00 - thing to do
23:02 - so let's run sudo
23:05 - expo
23:06 - build ios
23:09 - and now we have the linux subsystem up
23:11 - so
23:15 - oh
23:16 - it's not going to let me do pseudo
23:18 - because this is still the
23:20 - uh still that one
23:26 - nothing
23:27 - [Music]
23:35 - yeah okay this is not i'm not gonna be
23:37 - able to run it from within there
23:39 - of course i can't do pseudo you know
23:40 - what i could do i could open this
23:42 - project from um
23:44 - as an admin
23:47 - so let's do that
23:50 - actually let's let's just try to run it
23:53 - let's try to run it one more time with
23:55 - uh ubuntu actually running
23:58 - just to see if that'll help
24:19 - all right did not help so next step
24:23 - all right here's the next two steps i'm
24:25 - going to take i'm going to try to open
24:26 - this as an administrator and run it if
24:28 - that doesn't work i'm going to try to
24:30 - run it in powershell and see if that
24:31 - works
24:32 - then
24:44 - do i already have this open yeah i do
24:48 - this one is run as admin
24:50 - i believe i already have an admin
24:54 - version of vs code running
24:56 - so
24:58 - i'm just gonna
24:59 - go to
25:03 - open workspace
25:05 - and
25:07 - small projects
25:16 - what can i not find my
25:18 - projects for
25:27 - that's weird
25:37 - there we go
25:42 - stay focused
25:46 - uh
25:47 - did i after all that it was the wrong
25:50 - thing
25:51 - open folder
26:00 - um
26:12 - what didn't open it
26:14 - no all right
26:26 - run as administrator
26:32 - all right running as administrator
26:36 - see if this makes a difference
26:52 - okay
27:00 - now let's run
27:03 - expose
27:08 - ios
27:29 - all right
27:30 - onto powershell it is
27:40 - oh i can't do cd
27:44 - i don't know how to make powershell
27:46 - bigger
27:55 - let's run it as admin just to be sure
27:58 - though uh
28:04 - windows system32
28:06 - i need to look up powershell commands
28:09 - uh
28:14 - there we go change directory
28:22 - no that's not
28:45 - there we go
28:51 - if i could do
28:53 - what
28:57 - all right
29:00 - that's an insane amount of files i did
29:02 - not need to know all of that
29:06 - um
29:10 - change directory uh
29:14 - where am i in
29:17 - there we go
29:18 - [Music]
29:22 - there we go
29:24 - i'm sorry about this uh font size i just
29:27 - like
29:28 - i never use this so i don't really know
29:30 - how to make it bigger
29:41 - all right
29:43 - i'm assuming that i can get to users
29:45 - directory from here
29:51 - no
29:53 - maybe
30:01 - where am i at windows
30:05 - let's go here and see
30:26 - okay now from here
30:28 - there we go
30:31 - users
30:33 - and then jesse and then
30:36 - projects and then stay focused yay
30:40 - finally i'm in here okay
30:43 - now
30:44 - let's see if this will work
30:46 - expo
30:48 - build
30:49 - ios
30:56 - yes
31:04 - all right
31:14 - [Music]
31:21 - uh this is a good sign right whoa all
31:24 - right we get past that step nice
31:27 - all right
31:28 - it says
31:40 - all right so it's sent me a text message
31:42 - for the six digit code
31:44 - i have to put that code in
31:58 - what developer portal failed
32:01 - when author has access
32:04 - no
32:05 - i got so close
32:08 - zero
32:10 - five one one
32:31 - all right
32:32 - i got farther but for some reason
32:36 - it didn't work
32:38 - dang it
32:42 - let's try this again
33:05 - [Music]
33:17 - all right so i got a new code
34:00 - okay well my timer ran up so let me go
34:02 - some questions now
34:05 - and uh
34:08 - take a
34:09 - few minutes as a break
34:11 - and
34:12 - then i get back to it
34:33 - um
34:35 - world's world best tick tock official sf
34:38 - i'll make flutter tutorials uh probably
34:40 - again i'm not gonna make a flutter
34:42 - tutorial anytime soon uh because i just
34:44 - i don't work with flutter
34:46 - so
34:49 - probably not gonna happen uh usually the
34:52 - tutorials i do i i use like stuff that i
34:55 - actually use so that i could
34:57 - like know what i'm talking about
35:05 - uh there's some questions about like
35:06 - what is the app what's it capable of
35:08 - i'll give a little overview but if you
35:09 - want to know more check out like the
35:11 - previous um
35:14 - the the previous live streams or uh on
35:16 - my youtube channel i go over the the
35:19 - notion nerosity headset
35:22 - that is the brain computer
35:23 - um and the links in the description to
35:26 - my channel so you can check that out i
35:28 - go into a lot more detail but basically
35:30 - this app just works
35:32 - you put a device on your head
35:35 - actually
35:36 - this device
35:38 - you put this device on your head it
35:40 - reads your brain waves specifically
35:42 - we're looking at uh the part of the
35:44 - brain that tells us your level of focus
35:47 - and when your level of focus goes below
35:49 - a certain amount the phone vibrates and
35:52 - flashes the color red
35:54 - and then
35:55 - that way it gives you a little
35:59 - reminder to stay focused
36:13 - uh
36:15 - john jonathan says uh hi i heard i i
36:18 - heard order helps on energy levels do
36:21 - you have videos on that like
36:22 - organization of data time and files
36:25 - because it also absorbs your energy to
36:26 - have digital disorder and
36:28 - congratulations
36:29 - um well thank you and you know what i
36:32 - actually don't have a video on that but
36:34 - i've been thinking about doing a video
36:36 - on how i do project management with like
36:38 - a kanban board
36:40 - so um
36:42 - that that kind of falls into that in
36:44 - terms of like managing the tasks
36:46 - in a particular project so i was
36:48 - thinking about doing that video i wanted
36:50 - to do it today i don't know if all the
36:51 - time or not but
36:53 - i want to do that video soon
37:02 - um
37:04 - someone says hey i need a good tech lead
37:06 - to project manage and build a team on an
37:08 - application i'm building do you do any
37:09 - consulting work or know anybody
37:10 - qualified i can talk to
37:12 - um send me a dm on twitter or something
37:15 - my link's in the description uh i don't
37:18 - know that i have that much time to do it
37:19 - myself but i could try to get you
37:23 - get you in touch with somebody
37:41 - um someone asks about
37:43 - um
37:45 - what's react native why is it useful
37:47 - react native lets you use
37:49 - javascript to build native mobile apps
37:52 - so
37:54 - it's very useful if you know javascript
37:56 - and you don't want to have to learn
37:58 - two other languages
38:00 - to be able to build for android and ios
38:05 - someone asked why expo uh expo i think
38:08 - makes it very easy to work with react
38:09 - native easy to build and and run locally
38:12 - and test also
38:14 - it's supposed to be easy to build for
38:17 - ios even if you're on windows although
38:19 - we're having some issues with it right
38:21 - now
38:22 - and uh so that's why i chose it
38:27 - pj gaming says love from india man
38:30 - uh thank you i appreciate that
38:36 - someone asked what a brain computer is
38:38 - um i think i just showed you what the
38:41 - brain computer looks like and um
38:44 - kind of gave a little description if you
38:45 - want to know more check out the link in
38:47 - the description of my youtube channel i
38:48 - do a whole demo video on the nerosity
38:51 - notion brain computer interface
39:10 - looks like there's a nice discussion
39:11 - about why you would learn javascript
39:15 - uh in the chat there
39:20 - uh someone asked how they can get the
39:21 - previous material because this is the
39:22 - first one they saw uh check out the um
39:25 - the videos on the free code camp youtube
39:28 - channel uh the the previous videos
39:30 - they'll all have like the same thumbnail
39:32 - and they'll all be listed as uh i
39:34 - believe it's build a brain computer with
39:37 - react native
39:38 - our brain computer app with react native
39:42 - all right i'm gonna
39:45 - go back to the code now
39:47 - and
39:48 - here's what i'm gonna do uh
39:57 - i'm gonna copy this
39:59 - and see if we can debug what's happening
40:11 - yep this is it this is exactly what
40:12 - we're getting
40:18 - um
40:19 - probably need to accept some new
40:20 - agreements in itunes connect
40:42 - all right
40:43 - let's check this out then and see
40:46 - it doesn't look like that help for that
40:47 - person but
40:49 - it's worth it worth a try uh
40:53 - oh looks like it let me get in um
40:56 - agreements
40:58 - see what this is
41:04 - oh there we go
41:06 - new agreement
41:07 - yep hey you all know my address
41:13 - wonderful
41:19 - i don't really care because like
41:20 - honestly if somebody wanted to know my
41:22 - address like it wouldn't be that hard to
41:23 - find it online
41:25 - i'm sure it's like publicly available
41:37 - what set up tax banking and contact i
41:40 - don't want to do all that let me do this
41:42 - on my other screen and just see if
41:48 - no i'm not gonna set up tax forms right
41:50 - now
42:26 - all right anyway
42:28 - um
42:30 - i opened up this page because we'll need
42:32 - this page to register an app id
42:34 - or to register our app once we get it
42:36 - built
42:37 - but
42:38 - i guess it's worth a try to run this
42:40 - again just to see if
42:43 - if that really was the case that i
42:44 - needed to accept that
43:11 - [Music]
43:23 - dang
43:24 - all right so that didn't work all right
43:26 - let's go to
43:30 - let's go to that github issue see what
43:32 - else people are saying
43:40 - all right so
43:42 - yeah unauthorized access
44:07 - you
44:38 - hmm
44:41 - all right that's interesting
45:11 - so this person said they uh
45:16 - signed signed out of the main apple id
45:20 - logged in with the id they're trying to
45:22 - use with expo
45:24 - tried to build it and then that worked
45:28 - because there was an extra step of
45:30 - clicking allow
45:35 - i guess did i bring my macbook down
45:39 - i didn't i left it up i meant to bring
45:41 - it down
45:43 - what i could try to do is be on my
45:46 - macbook with this account at the same
45:48 - time just to see if some sort of
45:51 - other notification comes up
45:56 - i would
45:57 - hope that
46:02 - that wouldn't be the case jesus
46:07 - check this one out before i do that
46:20 - team happens to me
46:30 - interesting
46:44 - actually so setting
46:46 - this with the default phone number it
46:48 - said it solved it
46:51 - we could try that
47:03 - all right so saying if i enter sms
47:06 - then select the trusted phone
47:08 - number and then enter that second code
47:13 - then it works
47:15 - let's try that that seems like it'll be
47:18 - pretty easy to test
47:24 - i'm sorry this is so small
47:26 - let me uh
47:31 - whoa
47:39 - what the heck
47:45 - why is it giving me i don't know why
47:46 - it's giving me a different
47:51 - different input
47:53 - um
48:02 - make powershell font bigger
48:09 - properties
48:20 - there we go
48:30 - yeah you know what let's make this fill
48:31 - up half the screen
48:35 - all right
48:36 - and
48:39 - okay that is wrapping
48:43 - yes i do have access
48:45 - to the apple store
48:48 - why is this not working
49:16 - all right
49:28 - what
49:33 - too many verification codes have been
49:35 - sent uh
50:04 - all right let me
50:12 - let me grab my mac real quick we're
50:14 - going to take a
50:17 - we're going to take a break
50:19 - so
50:20 - we'll take like
50:22 - i don't know like
50:23 - two minutes or something for me to get
50:25 - my mac and it should still be running so
50:28 - i shouldn't have to like actually set it
50:29 - up or anything like that
50:31 - and
50:32 - then i'll come back so i'm pretty sure i
50:34 - have my my stuff just upstairs
50:38 - i will be right back
51:03 - hey
51:27 - let's do it
52:16 - all right so got my macbook
52:19 - one of my kids just lost a tooth
52:22 - so that's cool
52:23 - uh
52:25 - all right
52:26 - i don't know how long it's gonna
52:28 - like make us wait until we can send
52:31 - another code hopefully not too long but
52:34 - i'm also hoping that maybe
52:37 - the one person mentioned
52:39 - something about
52:42 - the
52:44 - like a button popping up
52:46 - on their macbook
52:49 - saying to accept so i'm i'm hoping that
52:51 - maybe like
52:52 - a button will pop up uh instead of
52:56 - the uh
52:58 - come on macbook what are you doing
53:07 - why is my macbook not working
53:10 - i'm hoping the button will pop up and
53:12 - then i'll be able to just click that
53:13 - instead of having to do the text message
53:16 - for some reason
53:18 - the macbook screen just went black
53:40 - that's crazy
53:41 - it was fully charged it should not run
53:44 - out of batteries
53:45 - i don't know if that's the issue or not
53:46 - but
53:52 - it was fully charged all right cool i
53:56 - don't know what why the screen just
53:58 - keeps going there we go
54:08 - okay
54:09 - let me sign in to my apple account
54:12 - on my macbook and see if i'll get some
54:15 - sort of prompt on there when we try to
54:17 - do this
55:24 - all right let's run this again
55:26 - see if anything happens
55:38 - all right
55:55 - all right see what it'll give us now
55:58 - okay
56:00 - let's type in sms
56:03 - now let's select
56:05 - i guess if i put in one
56:09 - ah too many messages again shoot
56:12 - now it did say we could try putting in
56:13 - whatever the last message was that we
56:15 - got so i guess i could try that
56:17 - it's worth a shot
56:27 - did we get oh kevin's back in here
56:31 - kevin
56:33 - i gotta i gotta
56:35 - boot you from the channel man
56:38 - i don't understand sometime kevin comes
56:40 - in and he talks normal and sometimes he
56:41 - just spams the channel
56:43 - i don't under i can't tell yet if he's
56:45 - like serious or
56:47 - just messing around all the time
56:54 - all right
57:05 - okay
57:08 - so
57:09 - let's let me try to just enter the last
57:11 - one i have i don't really think this
57:12 - will work but
57:15 - it's worth a try
57:40 - okay let me get my last code
57:45 - zero three one
57:50 - seven
57:51 - three
57:52 - two
57:56 - nope
57:59 - all right
58:06 - let's see
58:14 - uh john jonathan says jesse do you know
58:16 - how to recover apple id
58:19 - um
58:21 - i don't think i need to recover the
58:23 - apple id at this point
58:25 - like i got i have the right id and
58:27 - password
58:29 - the problem is with the
58:30 - text messaging so it looked like
58:33 - a lot of other people were having the
58:35 - same issue and someone was able to fix
58:37 - it by
58:38 - requesting a second text message
58:42 - and that seemed to fix it
58:48 - looking for lemon says try entering the
58:49 - spaceship 2fa thing yeah actually that's
58:52 - a good idea um
58:54 - to enter it like that maybe it'll
58:57 - it'll let it come in so
58:59 - i'll try that
59:01 - um
59:04 - let me see oh i know what i was going to
59:05 - do
59:06 - i want to see if i can
59:08 - uh
59:09 - if there's like some way to reset it
59:12 - in terms of my
59:14 - like in my apple account
59:19 - let's see if i can
59:23 - i'm gonna go to app store connect
59:34 - no that's not i'm not seeing anything
59:38 - users there's a users an access panel
59:43 - but that is not
59:51 - all right let's pull this over let's see
59:53 - if there's going to be a spot where
59:55 - i might be able to do something
59:57 - i think it'll be this place so right now
60:02 - um
60:18 - i thought there was more to this screen
60:20 - there we go
60:22 - account holder admin and finance
60:25 - let me developer
60:32 - all right yeah i don't think this is
60:34 - going to be it now
60:36 - oh well
60:37 - keys
60:52 - i mean it seems like the app store
60:54 - connect api would be good but i don't
60:56 - think that that's what um expo uses so
61:00 - it's not necessarily going to help us in
61:02 - this case
61:05 - so i think i copied and pasted what i
61:07 - needed
61:14 - no
61:15 - it's not gonna
61:18 - yeah it's not gonna come up
61:21 - too much
61:26 - okay so let's try the um
61:29 - that two factor authentication thing
61:33 - let me find where it's at
61:39 - i believe it was in the docks here
61:57 - and
61:58 - where are we at
62:08 - maybe it wasn't in these ducks
62:11 - maybe it was in one of the um
62:20 - don't want android
62:21 - ios
62:29 - yeah maybe it was just in one of the
62:32 - one of these ah there we go
62:42 - okay
62:56 - let's read this is the actual
62:58 - issue on fast lane which is what we're
63:00 - trying to use to get the uh
63:05 - um
63:06 - to get the app there
63:10 - so make sure to see what their
63:12 - what they're saying about it
63:19 - all right
63:39 - hmm
64:00 - all right let's see this is
64:02 - this is all pretty recent like this one
64:04 - was 23 days ago
64:36 - what would be cool is if i could at
64:39 - least temporarily turn off two-factor
64:41 - authentication
65:01 - interesting somebody's saying that they
65:03 - got it to work by changing the password
65:05 - and then signing out of all their
65:07 - devices
65:44 - all right so they have a pr that's
65:46 - supposed to fix it but
65:50 - it's still open
65:53 - not surprising i assumed it was still
66:08 - hmm
66:26 - oh interesting
66:29 - they get to this point they type sms
66:31 - it'll ask at this point and then they
66:33 - enter in the code
66:35 - that they received earlier
66:41 - we didn't try that yet
66:43 - let's try that
66:53 - all right
67:22 - oh that actually sent a new code
67:25 - let me see
67:35 - all right there we go there's the second
67:37 - one
67:41 - three
67:44 - four
67:46 - three two six four three four three two
67:50 - six four three four three two double
67:52 - checking that
67:53 - come
67:54 - on
67:56 - yes
68:03 - yes yes it's working
68:07 - sweet okay
68:10 - let expo handle the process yes
68:13 - do it
68:19 - only took us an hour
68:21 - we finally logged in
68:39 - the expo handle the problem
68:41 - just
68:42 - uh if you're not if you can't see what's
68:44 - coming up on the screen there uh the
68:46 - fonts still might be a little small i'm
68:48 - just clicking let expo handle the
68:50 - process to every option
68:52 - because at this point i don't want to
68:53 - mess anything up and go through that
68:55 - process again
68:58 - wow so we we had like several um
69:04 - several issues there while that's going
69:05 - we'll just like recap so um the first
69:08 - issue was
69:10 - we couldn't actually run this
69:12 - from
69:13 - the bash terminal in vs code we had to
69:16 - run it from powershell i happen to be
69:19 - running powershell as an administrator i
69:21 - don't know if that makes a difference or
69:22 - not because i just skipped right to that
69:24 - because i didn't i didn't want to mess
69:25 - with with
69:26 - running it normally
69:28 - um
69:29 - but it did work with powershell as an
69:31 - admin
69:33 - then once we we got in there
69:35 - uh and we could actually
69:38 - log in
69:40 - uh to apple
69:44 - let's see what was it
69:49 - you could log into apple and then the
69:51 - issue was with the text messages so
69:54 - there is a bug with fast lane
69:57 - the fast lane uh package
70:00 - and
70:01 - there's a fix for it that has not been
70:03 - merged yet on github
70:06 - so currently right now
70:07 - it will send a text message but the
70:09 - first one it says does not work
70:11 - you have to request a second one
70:14 - by typing sms instead of the code you
70:17 - get
70:18 - then it sends a second one after you
70:20 - specify what
70:22 - number to send it to
70:24 - the second one is the one that works
70:28 - so if anybody's trying to launch
70:30 - to
70:32 - the uh the app store using fastlane
70:37 - keep that in mind
70:38 - hopefully
70:39 - uh it looks like that
70:42 - that
70:43 - pull request has been out for like 15
70:45 - days
70:46 - and it still hasn't been merged yet so
70:49 - hopefully it gets in there at some point
70:50 - soon
70:51 - i don't really know what fastlane is to
70:53 - be honest if it's a company that has
70:56 - this or um
70:58 - if it's just like the community runs it
71:00 - if it's just the community like
71:02 - that totally explains why it hasn't been
71:04 - merged yet you know if nobody is is
71:06 - actually like getting paid to keep that
71:08 - up sometimes it's difficult
71:11 - but all right that's cool the build is
71:14 - in progress and we can monitor it here
71:16 - at this url
71:18 - let's see
71:20 - if
71:21 - let's copy and paste that
71:27 - once our build is ready
71:31 - oh sweet is it finished nice
71:35 - it is finished
71:36 - very cool okay so our build is finished
71:39 - let's go back to our documentation
71:44 - wait for the build to finish
71:46 - and
72:01 - build your actual project which is
72:02 - simulator flag then download the
72:04 - timeline given
72:08 - which we can't
72:10 - uh we can't simulate it on this device
72:14 - so
72:15 - test the device build with apple test
72:17 - flight download the file to your local
72:19 - machine upload the app to test flight
72:25 - which i don't know what test flight is
72:40 - um
72:53 - oh is this an app store thing
72:57 - beta testing made simple with test
72:59 - flight
73:00 - i guess i can't do it
73:03 - here
73:20 - we have this here
73:22 - we have this url here
73:25 - which
73:28 - that has our our build
73:32 - and
73:36 - oh hey
73:37 - we could
73:46 - i don't know if i could download this
73:47 - and test it
74:05 - all right that could take 10 to 15
74:07 - minutes to build let's
74:16 - let's check out our
74:18 - i thought i had this open somewhere
74:20 - already
74:21 - said uploading apps yeah uploading apps
74:24 - to
74:25 - the app store
74:32 - if you choose to upload your ios app to
74:34 - test flight
74:38 - oh we can just do expo
74:40 - upload ios
75:00 - all right let's do this
75:14 - that feature works on mac
75:16 - os only
75:17 - all right so it looks like i can't do
75:19 - that manually uploading
75:28 - looks like i won't be able to do this
75:39 - hmm
76:03 - all right so it looks like i have to use
76:08 - this is this is somewhat misleading that
76:11 - i can build for ios
76:15 - on the
76:18 - um
76:21 - on windows but i can't submit is this
76:24 - correct does anybody have experience
76:25 - with this
76:28 - this seems like very odd um
76:31 - let's see
76:37 - store
76:41 - submit your is to absolute windows
76:43 - system
76:45 - 2017 get out of here it's too old
76:48 - uh i'm gonna check for anything in the
76:50 - past year let's make this bigger
76:54 - how to submit your app to the app store
77:11 - all right so this is microsoft
77:36 - all right so the first the first time it
77:38 - has to be
77:40 - i don't think that's going to help i
77:41 - think that's the same same problem we
77:43 - have right now
78:05 - hmm
78:17 - yeah
78:18 - that's not using windows all right so
78:22 - i guess what i have to do is
78:28 - let's switch this over
78:36 - see what i can do
79:06 - i'm going to see if i can
79:10 - uh
79:12 - hop on to this stream
79:15 - on my macbook
79:18 - i don't i usually don't stream from my
79:19 - macbook because the quality is is not
79:22 - great
79:23 - but
79:24 - i'd rather you be able to see what's
79:26 - going on
79:53 - all right
79:57 - all right let's see let me
79:59 - i'm going to briefly stop streaming here
80:02 - and then pick up my stream on my other
80:05 - computer
80:06 - i don't know i've never tried this
80:07 - before
80:09 - but uh
80:12 - we'll see how it goes maybe it'll work
80:16 - i have already
80:20 - downloaded this
80:23 - i don't think i'll need to do anything
80:24 - with the code so i think we're fine
80:26 - there
80:27 - but just in case i've already downloaded
80:29 - the repo
80:36 - i'm going to stop
80:42 - all right let's see uh
80:49 - all right can you all
80:51 - can you all see me or hear me
80:58 - let me know if you can hear me i think
81:00 - you can see me right now
81:02 - i'm going to try to
81:05 - shrink this window down
81:09 - sweet so evidently i can switch devices
81:12 - in the middle of the stream and it'll
81:14 - keep the stream going that's pretty
81:15 - sweet
81:17 - i need to figure out
81:20 - how to get this
81:23 - window to fit
81:36 - all right that's pretty close
81:38 - close enough all right let's go to
81:43 - my apple
81:47 - apple developer program
81:50 - and let's also go to expo dot io
81:57 - so i'll sign in to my expo account
82:01 - and then we'll be able to download
82:07 - we should be able to download the file
82:11 - that
82:14 - that we just created
82:16 - and
82:17 - oh you know what let me
82:20 - what was that thing that they said
82:22 - there was some sort of thing that
82:25 - i needed to get from the app store the
82:28 - transporter
82:37 - download transporter from the app store
82:40 - okay
82:41 - so i do want to get into here
82:46 - and i also want to get
82:50 - let's open up the app store
82:53 - and get transporter
83:05 - hopefully that's not a large install
83:10 - and
83:11 - i don't want to enroll i want to log in
83:14 - see if it'll let me log in
83:23 - um
83:37 - oh not this again
83:39 - two factor off all the time all right
83:42 - uh
83:43 - eight
83:46 - four
83:48 - five
83:52 - nine two five
83:54 - cool
83:56 - sure go ahead and trust it
84:00 - what's up app store nice transporter is
84:04 - here
84:05 - let's check out expo
84:08 - i hope the stream isn't lagging too much
84:11 - uh
84:13 - usually when i try to do stuff on
84:18 - my macbook one and stream it it does not
84:21 - work
84:39 - another code
84:44 - five six seven
84:47 - seven five nine
84:54 - all right so
84:55 - here's another tip when you're doing
84:57 - anything with the app store uh make sure
85:00 - you have your your phone ready because
85:02 - you're gonna get a million text messages
85:05 - sweet so we can add the app
85:08 - uh this is the one we want
85:13 - stay focused let's download it
85:18 - i will say the build for ios took
85:20 - significantly less time than the android
85:23 - build
85:25 - uh downloads
85:34 - nice seems really small
85:38 - um
85:40 - downloads
85:41 - nice there it is
85:44 - just put it in
85:49 - all right cool
85:59 - all right so it's going to do its thing
86:00 - and examine this and then at some point
86:02 - the button will come up to say deliver
86:06 - no suitable application records were
86:08 - found verify your bundle identifier
86:11 - com.jesus focus is correct
86:20 - hmm
86:24 - let's try that again
86:34 - i shouldn't have clicked off of that
86:36 - error i should have looked it up right
86:37 - away
86:38 - okay
86:39 - um let me
86:42 - let me look i'm gonna look this up on my
86:43 - other screen real quick just because i
86:44 - got more space over here
86:47 - um
86:48 - let's see
86:58 - there we go
86:59 - it
87:00 - the auto complete came up pretty quick
87:03 - so i think this is a common problem i
87:06 - see it on stack overflow
87:21 - okay
87:38 - all right for somebody it just seems
87:40 - like
87:46 - itunes connect click on my app plus sign
87:49 - new app
87:51 - fill out all the info choose your bundle
87:52 - id for the app you're uploading now
87:55 - maybe i have to do this maybe there's a
87:57 - step i have to do first
88:13 - um
88:18 - let's go to
88:22 - i know i i know it's already there
88:54 - okay actually it looks like
88:58 - let me switch back
89:00 - i think this this actually is working i
89:03 - just need to do a step now in the app
89:05 - store connect so i'm going to switch
89:07 - back to
89:42 - um
89:58 - all right
89:59 - let me know
90:01 - let me know if you can hear me
90:03 - or you can see anything happening
90:21 - seems like i'm back
90:23 - all right so you can see like before
90:24 - when i tried to add an app
90:27 - this screen did not come up
90:29 - and now it actually has my my bundle
90:34 - um so you see like
90:39 - this stuff
90:40 - so using the expo cli
90:43 - to upload
90:45 - said it would
90:46 - it would need this stuff anyway
90:48 - uh so now it just seems like
90:51 - obviously like i'm doing the manual
90:52 - thing
90:59 - so connect
91:01 - test flight
91:04 - actually i wonder now it's saying
91:13 - let me double check i didn't see a test
91:17 - flight option yeah it doesn't say test
91:19 - flight
91:20 - all right
91:21 - i'm just double checking i'm in the
91:23 - right place i think this is the right
91:24 - place so uh this is going to be ios stay
91:27 - focused
91:28 - primary language is going to be english
91:30 - although there's not really many words
91:32 - in the whole app
91:34 - the sku
91:36 - a unique id for your app store that is
91:38 - not visible in the app
91:42 - uh i don't know how to do this at
91:45 - app store
91:47 - sku
91:50 - we'll just generate one how to get the
91:52 - sku number
92:04 - all right
92:24 - all right so it seems like we just make
92:26 - up whatever we want
92:28 - so let's let's do that let's go
92:35 - let's just say stay focused one
92:38 - uh user access what's this you can limit
92:41 - which users see this app and the full
92:43 - connect i'm sorry if that made a big
92:45 - noise i accidentally hit my microphone
92:48 - all right it seems like full access is
92:50 - cool let's create that
92:57 - sweet all right
92:59 - privacy policy url
93:01 - oh you know what we made that url in the
93:04 - last video
93:06 - let's see if we can grab that from our
93:08 - um
93:10 - our google
93:14 - privacy policy
93:15 - yeah
93:20 - no i don't want to edit when i want to
93:23 - let's share
93:25 - copy link
93:27 - there we go
93:28 - all right cool
93:30 - minimize that
93:36 - there we go
93:37 - subtitle
93:39 - um
93:59 - long enough um
94:05 - subtitles option i'm not going to put it
94:06 - because i can't think of one right now
94:09 - all right there we go no age rating
94:11 - category
94:12 - primary one i would say is productivity
94:18 - i don't know what secondary is maybe
94:23 - i don't know it's optional i'm not going
94:24 - to put it
94:28 - see
94:29 - save that
94:34 - so it saves pricing and availability
94:43 - what do you think should i charge 20
94:44 - bucks for this
94:48 - it's gonna be free i'm not gonna charge
94:50 - anything
94:51 - i don't think i can charge anyway
94:52 - because i didn't fill out all my all my
94:54 - stuff
94:57 - somebody said um we're losing the video
95:03 - oh no losing the video
95:15 - all right i'm sorry i haven't been
95:16 - keeping up that well with the uh
95:18 - with the channel or with the chat here
95:20 - for the stream
95:28 - all right cool price
95:30 - free
95:34 - all countries of region
95:38 - all right that looks good save that
95:43 - prepare for submission
95:52 - uh oh
95:59 - need to create
96:02 - uh let's see at preview
96:10 - app store
96:12 - um
96:20 - let's just see if we can find a
96:22 - generator is this one that we used
96:24 - before
96:27 - i think this was it
96:28 - and we had yeah this was it
96:31 - it was super easy to generate
96:33 - all the the ones that we needed
96:38 - and we used
96:40 - uh which ones did we use
96:43 - this one yeah we use these two
96:50 - cool
96:59 - oh i already have them
97:04 - maybe i already have them i just didn't
97:06 - realize
97:07 - uh
97:08 - probably downloads
97:13 - there we go
97:21 - no
97:29 - let me download it again because i
97:31 - thought
97:34 - back to editing device there we go
97:39 - iphone
97:41 - the site is not
97:44 - iphone
97:47 - oh they i think they want like
97:49 - better images
97:52 - hmm
98:04 - hmm
98:16 - what was the other one
98:18 - this might have been what i already have
98:21 - let's see
98:40 - yeah that looks like what i have
98:44 - let's just try to
98:46 - let's try to upload what i have
99:15 - um
99:16 - dimensions are wrong looks like i'm
99:19 - gonna have to go with some sort of other
99:23 - uh appsource screenshot designer
99:37 - hmm i don't want to log in
99:57 - wow
99:58 - there's a tornado warning in my area
100:01 - that's crazy
100:03 - just came up on my phone
100:06 - we usually don't get tornadoes here
100:09 - uh
100:10 - let's see
100:14 - fastlane automates that
100:20 - let me get rid of some of these windows
100:21 - and start
100:22 - over so this is definitely not making it
100:29 - the right
100:30 - dimensions
100:32 - what dimensions do i need
100:44 - all right so i need
100:46 - 1242 by 2688
101:08 - saying fastlane should automate all that
101:12 - and get rid of some of this stuff here
101:48 - i don't think i can do this on windows
101:51 - screenshots there you go
102:22 - i don't know if i want to install all
102:24 - this stuff right now
102:27 - we're already coming up on almost two
102:29 - hours for the stream
102:32 - uh
102:34 - i think i
102:36 - want to maybe try to get the
102:44 - screenshots
103:01 - hmm
103:02 - the same ones come up
103:07 - apple screenshot builder by launch pad
103:17 - we tried this before i didn't want to do
103:19 - it but
103:24 - let's give it a shot
103:33 - there we go
103:36 - ios
103:42 - fine that looks good
103:50 - um
104:28 - hey
104:37 - app store url
104:51 - did that download
104:53 - did not look good
104:56 - app is not live yet
104:58 - there we go
105:06 - uh someone said someone's fighting
105:07 - behind you yeah it's probably my kids so
105:10 - well for one thing it is um
105:14 - raining so hard it looks like there's a
105:16 - waterfall outside my house coming off my
105:18 - roof it's it's really crazy there's a
105:20 - tornado warning
105:22 - um
105:23 - my kids are running upstairs because
105:25 - they're probably like
105:28 - looking out the window and are all
105:29 - excited by the storm actually if the
105:33 - internet cuts out and the video cuts out
105:35 - you know what happened because
105:37 - it's storming it's really crazy
105:39 - um
105:40 - so yeah things are pretty crazy hey the
105:43 - app screenshots are downloading
105:46 - let's open this up see what we got
105:48 - alright cool we got a lot of screenshots
105:50 - so that's pretty sweet
105:52 - extract
105:54 - okay
105:57 - all right so
105:59 - let's go back here
106:01 - and see if
106:03 - we can get these
106:06 - apps screenshots
106:08 - let's
106:09 - let's pick some
106:12 - actually which size i needed 6.5 inch
106:15 - right
106:18 - i don't want that one
106:21 - at least six five there you go let's
106:23 - just throw in a bunch of them right
106:30 - i need
106:34 - five five
106:36 - whoops i didn't mean to click that
107:00 - okay
107:02 - all right
107:03 - that looks good
107:05 - um
107:11 - promotional text i'm just going to grab
107:13 - what i had from
107:15 - google
107:19 - and put it in here
107:23 - oops i guess not i guess i'll put it in
107:26 - here
107:28 - promotional text um
107:41 - there we go
107:43 - um let's see
108:02 - support url i don't have one do i need
108:05 - one
108:08 - marketing url i don't have one uh looks
108:11 - like support url is going to be
108:13 - necessary i guess i could do
108:23 - jesse weigle.com
108:26 - all right let's see
108:39 - all right the transformer app
108:42 - that's i'm going to try to do this again
108:45 - and add the app
108:47 - see if it'll take it this time
109:00 - doing that on my other machine
109:04 - um
109:05 - icon
109:11 - choose a file for the app store icon
109:14 - let's use the one that we generated
109:17 - uh where's that
109:23 - oh we gotta go in here users
109:26 - projects
109:30 - stay focused
109:32 - oops
109:34 - and assets
109:36 - let's use that one
109:43 - [Music]
109:53 - this
109:56 - let's say no sign in required
110:10 - [Music]
110:20 - and
110:21 - attachment for what notes
110:56 - okay
110:58 - yay
110:59 - it worked
111:00 - i'm gonna hit deliver
111:09 - so
111:10 - see if if y'all can see this
111:13 - probably not
111:14 - anyway
111:15 - it just says it's delivering to the app
111:19 - store now
111:20 - so basically if you remember beforehand
111:23 - uh it was saying that
111:25 - it didn't match like the build id didn't
111:27 - match or something like that
111:29 - well we we had to do this stuff on this
111:31 - end before we could upload it in there
111:34 - so
111:35 - i'm gonna automatically release that and
111:39 - let's hit save here
111:42 - see we're not ready yet certainly
111:44 - because we didn't actually upload it so
111:47 - um we are uploading the build now i
111:49 - assume that once the build is uploaded
111:53 - then we'll actually see it here
111:56 - so
112:00 - the upload is happening
112:08 - i don't know how long it's supposed to
112:09 - take to do the upload
112:11 - um it did say something about like make
112:14 - sure you're connected to a power source
112:15 - while you do this i don't have my plug
112:17 - down here so i'm not going to connect to
112:19 - power source while i do that but i can
112:21 - go back and
112:23 - answer some questions here in the chat
112:25 - while we're waiting for that to upload
112:27 - seems like that's the last thing we need
112:28 - to do anyway
112:30 - is do the upload and then
112:32 - we
112:33 - i believe we've done everything else
112:36 - that's required
112:38 - uh yeah so we need to upload and then
112:41 - submit for review
112:44 - so i'm going to scroll up and try to
112:45 - figure out where i left off in the chat
112:48 - it's been a while
112:51 - let's see
112:55 - all right i think i found it
113:06 - uh john jonathan says uh
113:10 - hey jesse if you don't get by
113:12 - if you don't get to do the time
113:14 - management video today
113:15 - what is the rain check because it is
113:17 - taking lots of time indeed let's help
113:20 - him um
113:25 - yeah i i don't know when i'll do it i
113:27 - mean i'll try to get to it at some point
113:29 - this week i suppose
113:34 - abdullah
113:35 - says hi how are you how many people are
113:37 - here uh i'm doing all right finally got
113:40 - things to work so there's a little bit
113:41 - of a struggle but it's working and and
113:43 - believe it or not this is still
113:46 - way faster than the android uh
113:49 - build and deploy so
113:52 - it looks like we're 37 of the way
113:55 - through with the app upload so
113:57 - now 40
113:58 - i think it's gonna happen pretty quick
114:00 - i'm assuming we'll see it on the screen
114:03 - maybe i'll have to refresh but uh it
114:05 - seems like we'll see it hey look there's
114:06 - the tesla thing
114:08 - cool
114:09 - now i see that
114:13 - what's new in test flight little builds
114:16 - oh cool we might get to see it here and
114:18 - run a test that'll be sweet
114:20 - let's we we should do that
114:23 - um all right
114:31 - oh abdallah actually asked as well how
114:34 - many people are on here actually right
114:36 - now there's only 56 but seemed like we
114:38 - had a lot more at some point
114:40 - wait we had
114:48 - my computer froze for a second there
114:50 - hopefully it didn't mess up the video
114:51 - too much
114:53 - um
114:54 - yeah we had at one point
114:58 - 190 viewers at a time so that's pretty
115:01 - sweet
115:03 - but right now right now we're at 52.
115:09 - um
115:10 - yeah i'm
115:11 - i figured we'd lose a lot of viewers
115:13 - because
115:14 - we had a lot of trouble
115:17 - sweet
115:18 - what is this
115:27 - sweet it said it was delivered
115:29 - so let me
115:30 - refresh this and see if we actually have
115:35 - oh is this the one that said
115:38 - something said that it might take a
115:39 - little while let's see
115:44 - the process can take a few minutes
115:46 - you can check the status you have
115:48 - submission test flight
115:55 - just click test right play and do your
115:58 - current builds all right
116:02 - i'll keep refreshing here every so often
116:07 - and um
116:10 - activity okay there's a build processing
116:12 - right now so
116:14 - uh i'll go back to the chat
116:19 - hopefully before i get through all the
116:20 - questions that'll be ready and we can
116:21 - run the the test flight that'll be cool
116:24 - i've never even seen that
116:26 - oh
116:29 - youtube's saying that
116:33 - the stream health is doing bad i hope my
116:35 - internet is not
116:36 - cutting out because of the storm
116:39 - oh well i'm gonna keep going
116:41 - do what i can
116:49 - uh where am i at
116:51 - okay
117:00 - [Music]
117:05 - sorry if i'm mispronouncing the name
117:06 - says how many years did it take to learn
117:09 - coding
117:11 - um
117:14 - i i'd say
117:16 - like it was a couple years before i
117:19 - started to get like really good at
117:20 - coding
117:24 - now i was
117:26 - like i was trying to do a lot
117:29 - at the time so i wasn't dedicated
117:31 - entirely to coding the entire time so
117:32 - when i first started out like getting
117:35 - paid to code i was also writing content
117:38 - so i was like a ghost writer for blogs i
117:40 - was doing search engine optimization
117:41 - work
117:42 - um
117:44 - like
117:45 - minor image editing stuff uh so
117:48 - there was um i was more of like uh
117:51 - like a multi-purpose
117:54 - like media marketing type of person
117:56 - right so
117:57 - uh once i really started coding
117:59 - full-time
118:02 - i leveled up very quickly
118:04 - so for me it was a couple years of
118:09 - coding and doing other things at the
118:10 - same time
118:12 - so if somebody could dedicate
118:14 - all their time to learning how to code
118:16 - they could probably get pretty good you
118:18 - know much more quickly
118:29 - um
118:31 - let's see
118:40 - jonathan asks someday can you talk about
118:42 - hardware installation of devices and
118:45 - streaming uh internet connections
118:48 - revisited
118:49 - um i probably could talk about hardware
118:52 - and stuff
118:55 - i don't know well i'd have to think
118:57 - about it
118:58 - what kind of
118:59 - like in particular kind of like what
119:01 - what type of stuff would you want to
119:03 - know about i never really thought about
119:05 - doing hardware
119:24 - see
119:25 - um
119:26 - kevin
119:27 - and i believe this is a different kevin
119:29 - than the one kevin that kept spamming
119:30 - the channel
119:31 - so kevin says uh
119:34 - which which platform do you deal with
119:36 - um
119:39 - web and mobile mainly
119:43 - so
119:44 - and that's via like react and react
119:46 - native
119:54 - um a question from id ids emerald i'm
119:58 - loving this i'm not really good in react
120:00 - but i would love to learn so can i learn
120:01 - from you um yeah sure i mean ask any
120:04 - questions you want during the stream
120:06 - hopefully you learned something for this
120:08 - particular stream we're not really doing
120:09 - much react like we build everything in
120:12 - react
120:13 - but this is more of like going through
120:15 - the the process the app store process i
120:18 - actually i really hope that i could save
120:20 - somebody some time um
120:23 - if they're trying to do
120:24 - a
120:26 - a build and stuff for the app store
120:28 - because we ran into some issues that
120:29 - that basically cost us a whole hour and
120:31 - it really shouldn't have it should have
120:33 - been like done in five minutes but it
120:34 - took an hour so if somebody sees this
120:37 - and is able to save an hour of work
120:39 - because of it
120:40 - then it'll definitely be worth it
120:58 - uh jonathan asks how did he grab the
121:00 - privacy policy uh so on the last stream
121:03 - i found the privacy policy generator and
121:05 - just used that and then saved it to my
121:07 - google docs
121:09 - and so then i just grabbed a uh a
121:11 - sharing link from the google google docs
121:13 - and put it in there
121:16 - so then i went in this stream and just
121:19 - clicked the link to that same google doc
121:26 - and mirandir mentioned that the test
121:29 - flight link is at the top left which i i
121:31 - saw it eventually but thank you for
121:33 - pointing that out i totally missed it
121:35 - at first
122:02 - uh
122:05 - strom stromboli kick says it's harder to
122:07 - upload the app than make the app
122:10 - you might be right i mean technically it
122:12 - did take us longer in terms of hours
122:15 - like to make the app but yeah it's uh it
122:18 - seems like it's gonna be
122:22 - when when like everything is all
122:24 - said and done it may end up being close
122:27 - to six hours sweet
122:29 - we got some progress we got the logo
122:32 - this is so processing
122:35 - nice it's here
122:37 - can i actually do something with it
122:49 - um
123:00 - um
123:14 - so will it
123:16 - will test flight run automatically
123:25 - in order to test the app you need to
123:28 - install the test flight ios app from the
123:30 - app store and sign in your chat buddy
123:32 - oh okay
123:35 - let me install that on my
123:37 - machine now
123:56 - wait oh no it's an ios app from the app
123:58 - store
124:03 - uh
124:05 - might need i might not be able to do
124:07 - tesla then because i don't have an ios
124:09 - device right now unless i could use
124:15 - unless i could use my wife
124:17 - i could text her real quick and see if i
124:19 - could borrow her phone
124:22 - let's see
124:35 - um
124:37 - all right
124:38 - go back to some questions
124:57 - uh deep sing says it's 11 where i am and
125:00 - i i'm kind of addicted by the way
125:02 - i guess
125:04 - that's cool you find it that interesting
125:06 - i guess
125:07 - uh so go check out cloud blocks what's
125:09 - what is cloud blocks
125:18 - uh amit pratap singh says i haven't
125:22 - stepped outside in seven days locked up
125:24 - this stream is the best thing to pay
125:25 - attention to well thank you
125:28 - all right well youtube's finally telling
125:30 - me that my stream health is back to
125:32 - being good so it actually says excellent
125:34 - that's that's cool
125:52 - let's see
125:54 - deepsync says i want to learn javascript
125:56 - but i'm 13.
125:57 - yeah you can definitely uh learn
126:00 - javascript at 13. um i've known some
126:03 - really good programmers that started out
126:05 - young
126:06 - and were good like very good in fact
126:10 - there was a uh a programmer who i
126:12 - believe was 14 when he started watching
126:14 - the streams and this was i've been
126:17 - streaming now for almost three years
126:19 - it'll be three years in april and um
126:22 - when i first started streaming like he
126:24 - started watching and was
126:27 - very very good and helped me a lot in
126:30 - the project i was working on
126:32 - and um he now he's uh
126:35 - i guess
126:37 - like 17 18 ish somewhere around there
126:40 - and um
126:43 - he already has a job with a company uh
126:46 - programming he's very good so
126:49 - yeah don't don't worry about you know
126:51 - only being 13 years old like
126:54 - get in there and and try to learn as
126:55 - much you can check out the tutorials on
126:58 - freecodecamp.org
127:00 - um that's that's part of like where i
127:02 - started out that's why i recommend
127:04 - everybody start out i think they're
127:06 - really good um and then depending on
127:08 - what how you like to learn
127:10 - you know check out some
127:12 - blogs uh videos like youtube videos
127:16 - um there are other online tutorials
127:20 - there are
127:21 - there are actually some good javascript
127:23 - books that are
127:24 - available for free like the ebook
127:26 - versions are available for free so
127:28 - there's a whole series called you don't
127:29 - know js
127:31 - there's a series called right i don't
127:33 - think it's a series i think it's one
127:34 - book called
127:35 - essential javascript
127:37 - um
127:38 - i believe that's what it's called i
127:40 - think there's like a peacock on the
127:41 - cover or something
127:43 - the like the online cover
127:45 - but yeah you know go for it and start
127:47 - building whatever you think is cool to
127:49 - work on
127:51 - oh okay he says um
127:54 - all this oh this was some other advice
127:56 - going free code can't finish the
127:58 - javascript course
128:00 - yeah so great advice it's
128:02 - same same thing i was thinking
128:08 - see
128:09 - i lost my place it skipped down on me
128:21 - uh black cat says hello everybody what
128:23 - do you think about angular uh i think it
128:25 - was fine i don't i don't really use
128:26 - angular but you know i know um you know
128:29 - good programmers that use it and build
128:31 - good stuff with it so
128:32 - uh certainly uh a valid option
128:41 - deepsync says what ide do you think is
128:44 - the best so ide is a integrated
128:46 - development environment
128:48 - if we want to consider vs code as an ide
128:51 - then i really like using vs code i work
128:54 - with some people that love visual studio
128:57 - um i know people that that really like
129:00 - some other
129:01 - you know other options but for me i've
129:03 - been using vs code for a couple years
129:05 - now and i i really like it it works very
129:07 - well for
129:08 - for javascript and typescript
129:12 - so i recommend that
129:19 - looks like
129:21 - my wife maybe does not have her phone on
129:23 - her right now because she didn't respond
129:24 - to my text message
129:42 - um
129:42 - micah says some say that there are more
129:44 - jobs in react than angular yeah i don't
129:46 - know the numbers for sure it i seem to
129:49 - see way more job listings for react than
129:51 - angular
129:53 - but it could be that i'm being targeted
129:55 - for react jobs because i am a react
129:57 - developer so i don't i don't really
129:59 - trust that too much
130:01 - and i don't know what the real numbers
130:02 - are
130:18 - let's see
130:23 - jonathan said oh you you ghost right i'm
130:25 - planning that while i love uh why code
130:29 - love to write both languages yeah i
130:31 - don't do any ghostwriting anymore but i
130:33 - used to um when i started out as a
130:36 - freelancer like i just i did whatever i
130:38 - could
130:39 - because i had
130:41 - i was married i already had two kids
130:44 - and i needed to pay the bills so i had
130:47 - to take care of my family so like
130:48 - whatever i could do for a client um
130:51 - like that had anything to do with
130:53 - websites
130:54 - i
130:55 - you know i would just do
131:10 - uh what mod randir says does uh react
131:13 - native equal react it does not if you
131:15 - want to know more about that i actually
131:17 - just did a video on my youtube channel
131:20 - that uh lets you know
131:22 - what the difference between react and
131:23 - react native is so you can check out
131:25 - that video the link to my channel is in
131:26 - the description
131:28 - of this video uh the short answer is
131:30 - they do they are not the same
131:33 - they share a lot in common but they are
131:35 - used for different things like primarily
131:38 - so if you want to know more check out
131:39 - that video
131:41 - i think it's less than 20 minute minutes
131:43 - long and i give some
131:45 - pretty simple examples of how they're
131:48 - they're different and how they're the
131:49 - same
132:05 - uh some someone asking uh
132:08 - people where they're from we have
132:09 - somebody from kenya someone from turkey
132:18 - someone asked if if we had a video uh
132:22 - in french
132:23 - i don't think we have any french
132:26 - language videos on the free code camp
132:28 - channel
132:29 - um i'm not sure what our
132:32 - our status is on subtitles
132:34 - um so
132:35 - apologies about that
132:41 - i really um
132:42 - primarily just speak english i know a
132:44 - little bit of some other languages but
132:46 - not nearly enough to do a video in
132:57 - oh no no we have people speaking in
132:59 - french in the chat
133:06 - i did take a french class once so
133:10 - i can
133:12 - say a few words in french
133:26 - okay so earlier somebody mentioned cloud
133:29 - blocks and
133:30 - i asked what that was and
133:33 - evidently cloudblocks is home automation
133:36 - so that's pretty cool
133:50 - uh haroon says it's it's uh 1108 pm in
133:53 - turkey and i'm gonna sleep thank you
133:54 - free code camp for these online courses
133:56 - see ya i'll see ya uh thanks for thanks
133:58 - for hanging in there and watching for so
134:00 - long
134:06 - uh eric asks for links where to start
134:08 - learning react uh go to freecodecamp.org
134:11 - and
134:12 - check out the lessons there there's a
134:13 - whole section on react i think it's a
134:15 - good intro
134:23 - jonathan says jesse thanks for the
134:24 - lifetime sharing and good luck thank you
134:26 - i appreciate that just going to get up
134:28 - because it's two hours they usually move
134:30 - uh around every hour for five minutes oh
134:32 - okay that's that's actually a good uh
134:35 - good thing to do
134:43 - um
134:47 - all right cool so i got through all the
134:49 - chat so i guess the
134:52 - my wife still didn't get back to me
134:53 - about borrowing her phone to do testing
134:56 - on so evidently
134:59 - this test flight thing
135:02 - is going to require
135:04 - me to download the test flight app on an
135:07 - iphone
135:09 - and
135:11 - missing compliance
135:14 - this build is missing export compliance
135:16 - information
135:20 - does your app use encryption
135:22 - if yes
135:24 - yes even if your app only uses standard
135:26 - encryption within apple just operating
135:28 - okay you know what there was something
135:30 - about
135:34 - what was it
135:41 - i remember there being some type of data
135:50 - look at this disclaimer at the top this
135:51 - feature works properly only on mac os i
135:53 - can't believe i missed that
135:55 - that would have saved a lot of time
135:58 - um
135:59 - where did i see it maybe it was on the
136:01 - build
136:04 - it was something about
136:06 - some special permissions
136:39 - where am i going to find it
136:54 - hmm
136:55 - i don't not see it maybe i have it open
136:57 - on my other computer i'm going to check
136:59 - really quick
137:03 - store review
137:16 - oh okay no it's different so i don't
137:18 - know what's exactly what the answer here
137:21 - i don't think that i use encryption
137:26 - if you're making use of ats or making
137:27 - calls to https you are required to
137:30 - submit
137:31 - a year and self-classification report to
137:34 - us government
137:36 - maybe i am encrypting all right let's
137:37 - just say yes then
137:39 - does you have qualify for any of the
137:41 - exemptions providing category 5 part 2
137:43 - of us export
137:46 - medical use
137:50 - yes
137:51 - this question if the encryption of your
137:53 - app is
138:00 - yes
138:10 - i think because it's limited to
138:11 - authentication digital signature
138:13 - decryption of data files
138:15 - i mean i'm pretty sure that the
138:19 - endpoints we hit to get data is https so
138:25 - that's the authentication part of it
138:27 - right
138:50 - so it's ready to test is this it right
139:05 - hmm
139:06 - oh maybe i have to do this
139:10 - okay
139:10 - i just did this
139:22 - actually
140:01 - privacy policy where was that at
140:05 - uh that's my other screen
140:08 - and
140:09 - i should policy
140:48 - all right there we go
141:11 - all right i don't really know
141:14 - expire bill who's this ready to submit
141:17 - let's see
141:21 - i'm gonna get back to the chat chat in
141:23 - just a minute
141:25 - one app store connect users
141:29 - add testers
141:38 - i wonder if i need to do this step
141:41 - like what if i went back to the app
141:42 - store and said
141:44 - i just want to upload this
142:05 - oh do i really need to add these
142:09 - okay so which one is this
142:11 - 12.9 inch display
142:17 - download
142:18 - tap screenshots
142:35 - what's this
142:37 - wait is this one 12.98
142:40 - i guess i'll just send them both in
142:49 - all right let's see
142:52 - anything else
142:55 - age rating
142:56 - uh
142:57 - no
142:59 - no no no no no
143:03 - no
143:06 - no
143:07 - no no
143:13 - there we go
143:17 - all right cool
143:18 - well copyright
143:21 - name of the person or anything's
143:23 - exclusive rights to your app
143:27 - jesse
143:34 - be fancy about it put the middle initial
143:37 - all right now let's see if i got it
143:42 - does your app contain show or access
143:44 - third-party content
143:47 - no
143:49 - does
143:50 - the app use advertising identifier oh
143:54 - actually yeah i think this was it
143:58 - yes
144:00 - it
144:04 - you want to check the following three
144:06 - boxes
144:07 - so on my other screen i have this
144:08 - attribute app installation to a
144:10 - previously served advertisement
144:13 - attributing action taken yes
144:20 - there we go
144:25 - man i'm glad i remembered that page and
144:26 - brought that up
144:30 - cool so my app is officially submitted
144:33 - and ready for review now
144:37 - i don't know what's going to happen
144:38 - because
144:40 - uh
144:41 - we didn't test it on an actual device
144:43 - i wanted to but i didn't have a device
144:47 - so
144:49 - we'll see what happens
144:51 - uh i don't know if it said
144:53 - waiting for review i don't know if it
144:55 - says how long
144:57 - it will take
144:59 - no not really okay
145:01 - um
145:02 - so yeah not sure how long that will take
145:05 - but for now let me go back to the chat
145:06 - i'm gonna get through the rest of the
145:07 - questions and then we'll wrap this up
145:12 - let's see
145:22 - deep singh says uh what time is it there
145:24 - jesse
145:25 - um
145:28 - it is 4 26 p.m
145:35 - so you look tired do i look tired after
145:38 - all the trouble shooting i think it just
145:39 - kind of got to me
145:43 - so
145:45 - i i
145:46 - i kind of feel tired
145:50 - uh jonathan jonathan asks can you
145:52 - emulate mac on uh pc i don't know if i
145:54 - can emulate a mac you can do like uh
145:57 - like a dual boot
145:59 - i believe i mean you can make
146:03 - they call it like a hackintosh
146:05 - and run
146:06 - mac os on a pc but
146:08 - i don't know i could just run mac in the
146:11 - pc i thought about maybe if i could do
146:13 - some sort of remote desktop thing then i
146:15 - could do stuff on my mac while i'm still
146:18 - on here
146:19 - i might look into that for future
146:20 - streams if i if i really have to
146:24 - do like ios stuff
146:32 - um deep says uh i'm actually surprised
146:35 - on how long it's stressful it is for
146:37 - people to put up their apps uh most
146:40 - youtubers
146:41 - out there show it as a piece of cake
146:43 - yeah it is it's harder than i thought it
146:45 - would be as well i think though now that
146:48 - i've done it this is the first time i
146:49 - ever did
146:51 - the
146:52 - app store the apple app store and then
146:54 - the last stream was the first time i
146:55 - ever did it on the google play store
146:58 - so
146:59 - having done it once now on each store i
147:01 - think doing it the second time would be
147:04 - way faster
147:06 - so
147:08 - you know knowing what to expect ahead of
147:10 - time will definitely help
147:13 - so i think i could do both stores like
147:16 - in less than an hour
147:17 - now
147:19 - assuming that like the
147:21 - the builds worked and everything
147:29 - eric says thanks for the info i will let
147:30 - all the other guys who are learning to
147:32 - code with me know that there's a free
147:34 - code camp website oh yeah
147:35 - awesome yeah definitely share the info
147:38 - uh is there anything else i should know
147:40 - um
147:41 - yeah i would start with free code camps
147:44 - lessons they have links to a lot of
147:45 - other resources as well i think it's a
147:47 - great place to start
147:49 - and um you know it's all completely free
147:52 - but uh do that there's enough lessons
147:55 - there that you know you could learn a
147:58 - lot just from from that website and then
148:00 - branch out
148:02 - like the free code camp youtube channel
148:04 - that you obviously know about because
148:05 - you're watching uh has a ton of great
148:07 - content uh
148:09 - free code camp has a forum and blogs um
148:14 - and you know they like they often link
148:16 - to other content too that's not just
148:18 - free code camp content so you'll you'll
148:20 - get an idea for where the good good
148:22 - stuff is
148:24 - deep says how much longer is this live
148:25 - stream going to go for uh i'd say just a
148:27 - few more minutes i'm almost to the end
148:29 - of the chat here and basically did
148:32 - everything we need at that point
148:34 - d says my mom wants me to sleep yeah
148:36 - you'll be just a couple more minutes
148:37 - we'll be done
148:39 - uh
148:41 - nerosity uh commented and that's who the
148:44 - company that makes the headset the brain
148:46 - computer headset says hashtag crushed
148:48 - thank you i appreciate it took longer
148:51 - than i than i thought
148:53 - um
148:54 - aj says if you do the
148:56 - test flight i'm happy to test on my
148:58 - device oh that's awesome
149:00 - um
149:02 - yeah i don't know how to
149:05 - i'm not really sure how to have other
149:07 - people test like
149:09 - i could add an external tester
149:13 - app store connect users
149:18 - i guess i could add myself
149:23 - um
149:25 - so i guess i've been invited now to test
149:27 - that's cool
149:28 - um
149:33 - anyway we could uh aj we could talk
149:35 - about it
149:36 - later too if you want to about what i
149:39 - need i guess i just need your
149:41 - email
149:42 - to add you
149:46 - or for external i don't really know
149:49 - i have to look into that more but that
149:50 - would be cool
149:52 - uh alexander says i have a little time
149:54 - just answer me one question how unit
149:56 - testing and react what is your
149:57 - experience with unit testing like you
149:59 - know what to be honest with you i tried
150:00 - to do unit testing and react but i found
150:02 - that i don't i don't see much value in
150:05 - it uh if you are doing
150:07 - end-to-end tests i think the end-to-end
150:09 - tests are much more valuable
150:11 - and
150:13 - um
150:14 - really
150:17 - make the unit test kind of obsolete
150:21 - all right so my internet cut out
150:23 - completely just a second ago
150:26 - it's lightning storming lightning storm
150:28 - all right my daughter just said it's
150:29 - lightning there's lightning so it cut
150:32 - out so i'm gonna i'm gonna get off here
150:34 - um
150:36 - let's see
150:37 - uh deep says it's now 11 31 here but i'm
150:40 - still happy to be here all right well
150:42 - i'm gonna i'm gonna finish up because i
150:43 - don't know how much longer my internet's
150:44 - going to
150:45 - uh going to work anyway
150:47 - so
150:49 - see y'all later
150:50 - uh thanks so much for hanging in here
150:52 - for this stream
150:54 - and um hopefully i'll be back at some
150:57 - point this week with some more streams
151:00 - and with gemma okay

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and i'm i'm excited to be here today i miss streaming i think the last time i streamed was a week ago so and i know the last time i streamed i had mentioned that i would like to do it like every other day and i definitely did not do it every other day so apologies for that i really i think what happened was uh after my last time that i streamed shortly after that maybe like just the reality of everything that's going on hit me and i just i got like super depressed and i had a lot of like anxiety and stuff so pretty much like just getting through the the normal week of uh working my normal job was about as much as i could do working my normal job trying to be there for my kids and my wife like i just had no energy there were a couple times when i tried to stay up late and do a stream and i just sat at the computer and just couldn't couldn't do it like couldn't start the stream just was too exhausted so i'm feeling pretty good today though had some good weather been trying to do some workouts at home hopefully i'll be i'll be all right but we have some good news so one piece of good news is the app got accepted to the google play store so on the last stream we did um we did submit it to the google play store so we're in so now um i just just brought up the dashboard here so evidently yesterday i acquired seven new users and i lost four so i'm guessing is that like a net then of three users one of them is me so uh i do know that uh some people downloaded it and then didn't realize they need to have the neurocity notion headset so it's uh understandable that people would delete it immediately but i downloaded on my device it worked pretty sweet you can see it here it is like in the app store on google play i'll post a link in the chat that way if anybody wants to check it out you can actually maybe i should put this link in the description to the video too if i remember to do that later on i'll do that um just a reminder too i've been putting out some tutorial videos on my own youtube channel links in the description uh please check those out if you want a lot of times the questions that i get frequently in the chat i will take those and turn them into tutorial videos uh so that you know if you have any questions about some of the stuff that i'm doing on the stream i may have already done a video to answer it uh and if you have any ideas of tutorial videos you'd like for me to do put them in the stream i keep a list of all the topics that i want to do so anytime anybody gives me a topic if it's something that i think is possible for me to do i put it on the list and when i have time i try to go through it and do some videos alright so see a lot of people in the chat saying hello hey everybody thanks for joining me today if you don't know yet we are going to submit our app to the apple app store we're going to build it first which more good news you can actually build using expo which we are using expo you can build for ios on a windows machine i did not know that earlier today i was on my my macbook and i was gonna go i was gonna build it on my macbook so it would be ready for the stream and i was going through the documentation and realized that i could just use expo so that's pretty awesome so that's what we're gonna do so we're going to make whatever changes we need to the code to get this ready to go we're going to do a build similar to what we did last time but this time we're going to build the type of file that we need to send to apple and then we're going to actually submit that to the apple app store so we'll take you through that whole process i don't know how long this is going to be remember the last time it took us like three hours to do the google play store so i'm hoping uh so some of the steps that we had to do then we won't have to do now so i think we can do it in way less than three hours uh but we'll see how it goes now one thing that we can't do that i'm slightly worried about is that we can't actually test on windows so um we might have to i don't know my wife has an iphone if we really need to test it and don't think it'll work on an iphone before we submit i could probably grab my wife's iphone and um maybe like download the expo app and just test it on her iphone first but other than that i think we should be good that's the only point of this whole thing that i think is going to be a problem now here's what i had to do before the stream to get ready for this i needed to create a developer account with apple alright and that is not cheap so it's a hundred dollars a year to create an account and uh i recommend like it said it could take up to 48 hours for the account creation process to to be complete so i'm glad i did it last night because uh it it could take a while thankfully though i got approved like very quickly i i think it was like less than an hour later i was approved something like that so i don't know i guess they just say 48 hours because you know maybe it's um potentially could take that long i don't know but that's already so that's definitely you you have to have that you can't submit to the app store without that so um you need to do that google play i believe is only like 25 and that's it it's just a onetime fee so if you want to start out with putting apps on an app store and you don't have a lot of money to start out with definitely recommend doing it on android it's significantly cheaper to do it on android let's get started i can see one thing that we need to do already we uh we took out the ios for the platform here last time because we weren't using ios but uh we're going to do switch that up to ios and support tablet true yep no reason why we couldn't support tablet now we have android we have it we have a package of version code and permissions i don't know that we need to do that but we're gonna we'll scroll through the documentation i read it beforehand uh but we'll go through step by step now actually let me set my timer i'm gonna do a 25 25minute timer of just going through the code in this case going through the documentation after 25 minutes i'm going to uh go back to the chat and i'm going to read the comments and answer questions in the chat i'll try to keep an eye on it on the chat as well uh occasionally just to make sure everything is going all right in there try to keep everything positive and let's scroll down so here we go install all right we've already done this step our app.json there we go let's add this in our ios build number and let's just throw in the same thing that we have here we'll put it in here and that looks good 1.0 it looks looks good that doesn't really matter it's not like uh not too serious about build numbers at this point all right that looks good and i believe that is the minimum that we need all right and let's go i'm gonna split the uh the terminal here let me push this down i'm gonna split the terminal up so we can start we can do expo start we found out on the last stream that you can't do a build if you haven't actually started expo yet so we're running the expo start there's a new version i thought we installed a new version last time that's weird i like i really thought we installed the latest version let's let's do the install real quick while that's going we could figure out our next steps as well i was uh i just didn't anybody watch last time didn't we update that i seriously doubt in one week it's the version has increased that much uh but anyway we'll we'll double check version numbers and stuff unless i have the uh the version in the package json locked we'll see all right so we have skipped the android part for ios i need the apple id and password which i have all right so just like we had our android key store last time we're gonna have a distribution certificate and uh i'm just gonna let expo handle that it looks like we need to make a password for that all right we're not gonna worry about pushing okay notifications right now we'll probably add those into the app at some point if we keep going with it so um just kind of make a mental note of that cool it looks like we're good uh in terms of build let's let's double check now and see if we are on the right version all right cool so we did not get the message that we're out of date so that's good it must have worked okay so that is working and i'm going to double check the oops wrong wrong thing but double check the command expo build ios that's it so let's throw that in there expo build colon ios it should work according to what i've read this should work i'm still like somewhat amazed that this is going to work on windows now do you have the access to the apple account yes i do have access to that apple id password what hmm all right let's try it again like i'm almost positive that was my correct username and password so let's try it again yeah you know what on my other screen i'm gonna check it out actually you know i just got an email from the app store i'm gonna verify what my login is because i need to do this anyway all right this this looks like slogan yeah so i was able to log in to my developer account here so you can see i'm logged in so let's uh all right let's try let's try it again hmm all right i'm gonna try one more thing hmm all right let me look back here and see for sure what we need you need your apple id and password hmm i'm gonna try to log out and see hmm all right that worked all right let me try one more time maybe i'm just typing it in wrong what's the problem when you try to use like secure passwords that have a bunch of uh different characters in it i guess sometimes it's hard to type in all right is jesse weigel at gmail.com all right all right here i'm going to copy and paste what i just typed in and uh hopefully that'll work hopefully it lets me maybe it didn't i guess we could do let's run let's get rid of up on that and let's run this uh expo debug true and then we'll throw in the uh yarn um what was it was it build ios yeah build ios or it was expo build ios you authentication to developer portal failed all right well let's look up this error then debug mode didn't really give us anything extra huh all right let's look up the air see what we're getting here can't authenticate it's always good when you get something hmm hmm uh what we can try is uh we could try to put the password and stuff in a uh i believe we have the option to put it in an environment variable file so let's try that i'm going to look at the chat real quick to see if somebody else has any ideas okay um i remember seeing in the documentation somewhere earlier that you can use uh environment variables instead so let me just gotta figure out what the keys are for that hmm i don't know what else i guess i could go back real quick and see after entering credentials wait is this it 127 that was what we get right all right so this is the same error let's um let's turn on that windows linux subsystem i don't know if it actually has to be running in the background remember we installed that the last time so um there we go we'll run that and hmm all right well this person said they use pseudo and that helped and they got two thumbs up and that's the only solution that i saw any anybody give thumbs up to which is usually a good sign so let's just try that because that's a very easy thing to do so let's run sudo expo build ios and now we have the linux subsystem up so oh it's not going to let me do pseudo because this is still the uh still that one nothing yeah okay this is not i'm not gonna be able to run it from within there of course i can't do pseudo you know what i could do i could open this project from um as an admin so let's do that actually let's let's just try to run it let's try to run it one more time with uh ubuntu actually running just to see if that'll help all right did not help so next step all right here's the next two steps i'm going to take i'm going to try to open this as an administrator and run it if that doesn't work i'm going to try to run it in powershell and see if that works then do i already have this open yeah i do this one is run as admin i believe i already have an admin version of vs code running so i'm just gonna go to open workspace and small projects what can i not find my projects for that's weird there we go stay focused uh did i after all that it was the wrong thing open folder um what didn't open it no all right run as administrator all right running as administrator see if this makes a difference okay now let's run expose ios all right onto powershell it is oh i can't do cd i don't know how to make powershell bigger let's run it as admin just to be sure though uh windows system32 i need to look up powershell commands uh there we go change directory no that's not there we go if i could do what all right that's an insane amount of files i did not need to know all of that um change directory uh where am i in there we go there we go i'm sorry about this uh font size i just like i never use this so i don't really know how to make it bigger all right i'm assuming that i can get to users directory from here no maybe where am i at windows let's go here and see okay now from here there we go users and then jesse and then projects and then stay focused yay finally i'm in here okay now let's see if this will work expo build ios yes all right uh this is a good sign right whoa all right we get past that step nice all right it says all right so it's sent me a text message for the six digit code i have to put that code in what developer portal failed when author has access no i got so close zero five one one all right i got farther but for some reason it didn't work dang it let's try this again all right so i got a new code okay well my timer ran up so let me go some questions now and uh take a few minutes as a break and then i get back to it um world's world best tick tock official sf i'll make flutter tutorials uh probably again i'm not gonna make a flutter tutorial anytime soon uh because i just i don't work with flutter so probably not gonna happen uh usually the tutorials i do i i use like stuff that i actually use so that i could like know what i'm talking about uh there's some questions about like what is the app what's it capable of i'll give a little overview but if you want to know more check out like the previous um the the previous live streams or uh on my youtube channel i go over the the notion nerosity headset that is the brain computer um and the links in the description to my channel so you can check that out i go into a lot more detail but basically this app just works you put a device on your head actually this device you put this device on your head it reads your brain waves specifically we're looking at uh the part of the brain that tells us your level of focus and when your level of focus goes below a certain amount the phone vibrates and flashes the color red and then that way it gives you a little reminder to stay focused uh john jonathan says uh hi i heard i i heard order helps on energy levels do you have videos on that like organization of data time and files because it also absorbs your energy to have digital disorder and congratulations um well thank you and you know what i actually don't have a video on that but i've been thinking about doing a video on how i do project management with like a kanban board so um that that kind of falls into that in terms of like managing the tasks in a particular project so i was thinking about doing that video i wanted to do it today i don't know if all the time or not but i want to do that video soon um someone says hey i need a good tech lead to project manage and build a team on an application i'm building do you do any consulting work or know anybody qualified i can talk to um send me a dm on twitter or something my link's in the description uh i don't know that i have that much time to do it myself but i could try to get you get you in touch with somebody um someone asks about um what's react native why is it useful react native lets you use javascript to build native mobile apps so it's very useful if you know javascript and you don't want to have to learn two other languages to be able to build for android and ios someone asked why expo uh expo i think makes it very easy to work with react native easy to build and and run locally and test also it's supposed to be easy to build for ios even if you're on windows although we're having some issues with it right now and uh so that's why i chose it pj gaming says love from india man uh thank you i appreciate that someone asked what a brain computer is um i think i just showed you what the brain computer looks like and um kind of gave a little description if you want to know more check out the link in the description of my youtube channel i do a whole demo video on the nerosity notion brain computer interface looks like there's a nice discussion about why you would learn javascript uh in the chat there uh someone asked how they can get the previous material because this is the first one they saw uh check out the um the videos on the free code camp youtube channel uh the the previous videos they'll all have like the same thumbnail and they'll all be listed as uh i believe it's build a brain computer with react native our brain computer app with react native all right i'm gonna go back to the code now and here's what i'm gonna do uh i'm gonna copy this and see if we can debug what's happening yep this is it this is exactly what we're getting um probably need to accept some new agreements in itunes connect all right let's check this out then and see it doesn't look like that help for that person but it's worth it worth a try uh oh looks like it let me get in um agreements see what this is oh there we go new agreement yep hey you all know my address wonderful i don't really care because like honestly if somebody wanted to know my address like it wouldn't be that hard to find it online i'm sure it's like publicly available what set up tax banking and contact i don't want to do all that let me do this on my other screen and just see if no i'm not gonna set up tax forms right now all right anyway um i opened up this page because we'll need this page to register an app id or to register our app once we get it built but i guess it's worth a try to run this again just to see if if that really was the case that i needed to accept that dang all right so that didn't work all right let's go to let's go to that github issue see what else people are saying all right so yeah unauthorized access you hmm all right that's interesting so this person said they uh signed signed out of the main apple id logged in with the id they're trying to use with expo tried to build it and then that worked because there was an extra step of clicking allow i guess did i bring my macbook down i didn't i left it up i meant to bring it down what i could try to do is be on my macbook with this account at the same time just to see if some sort of other notification comes up i would hope that that wouldn't be the case jesus check this one out before i do that team happens to me interesting actually so setting this with the default phone number it said it solved it we could try that all right so saying if i enter sms then select the trusted phone number and then enter that second code then it works let's try that that seems like it'll be pretty easy to test i'm sorry this is so small let me uh whoa what the heck why is it giving me i don't know why it's giving me a different different input um make powershell font bigger properties there we go yeah you know what let's make this fill up half the screen all right and okay that is wrapping yes i do have access to the apple store why is this not working all right what too many verification codes have been sent uh all right let me let me grab my mac real quick we're going to take a we're going to take a break so we'll take like i don't know like two minutes or something for me to get my mac and it should still be running so i shouldn't have to like actually set it up or anything like that and then i'll come back so i'm pretty sure i have my my stuff just upstairs i will be right back hey let's do it all right so got my macbook one of my kids just lost a tooth so that's cool uh all right i don't know how long it's gonna like make us wait until we can send another code hopefully not too long but i'm also hoping that maybe the one person mentioned something about the like a button popping up on their macbook saying to accept so i'm i'm hoping that maybe like a button will pop up uh instead of the uh come on macbook what are you doing why is my macbook not working i'm hoping the button will pop up and then i'll be able to just click that instead of having to do the text message for some reason the macbook screen just went black that's crazy it was fully charged it should not run out of batteries i don't know if that's the issue or not but it was fully charged all right cool i don't know what why the screen just keeps going there we go okay let me sign in to my apple account on my macbook and see if i'll get some sort of prompt on there when we try to do this all right let's run this again see if anything happens all right all right see what it'll give us now okay let's type in sms now let's select i guess if i put in one ah too many messages again shoot now it did say we could try putting in whatever the last message was that we got so i guess i could try that it's worth a shot did we get oh kevin's back in here kevin i gotta i gotta boot you from the channel man i don't understand sometime kevin comes in and he talks normal and sometimes he just spams the channel i don't under i can't tell yet if he's like serious or just messing around all the time all right okay so let's let me try to just enter the last one i have i don't really think this will work but it's worth a try okay let me get my last code zero three one seven three two nope all right let's see uh john jonathan says jesse do you know how to recover apple id um i don't think i need to recover the apple id at this point like i got i have the right id and password the problem is with the text messaging so it looked like a lot of other people were having the same issue and someone was able to fix it by requesting a second text message and that seemed to fix it looking for lemon says try entering the spaceship 2fa thing yeah actually that's a good idea um to enter it like that maybe it'll it'll let it come in so i'll try that um let me see oh i know what i was going to do i want to see if i can uh if there's like some way to reset it in terms of my like in my apple account let's see if i can i'm gonna go to app store connect no that's not i'm not seeing anything users there's a users an access panel but that is not all right let's pull this over let's see if there's going to be a spot where i might be able to do something i think it'll be this place so right now um i thought there was more to this screen there we go account holder admin and finance let me developer all right yeah i don't think this is going to be it now oh well keys i mean it seems like the app store connect api would be good but i don't think that that's what um expo uses so it's not necessarily going to help us in this case so i think i copied and pasted what i needed no it's not gonna yeah it's not gonna come up too much okay so let's try the um that two factor authentication thing let me find where it's at i believe it was in the docks here and where are we at maybe it wasn't in these ducks maybe it was in one of the um don't want android ios yeah maybe it was just in one of the one of these ah there we go okay let's read this is the actual issue on fast lane which is what we're trying to use to get the uh um to get the app there so make sure to see what their what they're saying about it all right hmm all right let's see this is this is all pretty recent like this one was 23 days ago what would be cool is if i could at least temporarily turn off twofactor authentication interesting somebody's saying that they got it to work by changing the password and then signing out of all their devices all right so they have a pr that's supposed to fix it but it's still open not surprising i assumed it was still hmm oh interesting they get to this point they type sms it'll ask at this point and then they enter in the code that they received earlier we didn't try that yet let's try that all right oh that actually sent a new code let me see all right there we go there's the second one three four three two six four three four three two six four three four three two double checking that come on yes yes yes it's working sweet okay let expo handle the process yes do it only took us an hour we finally logged in the expo handle the problem just uh if you're not if you can't see what's coming up on the screen there uh the fonts still might be a little small i'm just clicking let expo handle the process to every option because at this point i don't want to mess anything up and go through that process again wow so we we had like several um several issues there while that's going we'll just like recap so um the first issue was we couldn't actually run this from the bash terminal in vs code we had to run it from powershell i happen to be running powershell as an administrator i don't know if that makes a difference or not because i just skipped right to that because i didn't i didn't want to mess with with running it normally um but it did work with powershell as an admin then once we we got in there uh and we could actually log in uh to apple let's see what was it you could log into apple and then the issue was with the text messages so there is a bug with fast lane the fast lane uh package and there's a fix for it that has not been merged yet on github so currently right now it will send a text message but the first one it says does not work you have to request a second one by typing sms instead of the code you get then it sends a second one after you specify what number to send it to the second one is the one that works so if anybody's trying to launch to the uh the app store using fastlane keep that in mind hopefully uh it looks like that that pull request has been out for like 15 days and it still hasn't been merged yet so hopefully it gets in there at some point soon i don't really know what fastlane is to be honest if it's a company that has this or um if it's just like the community runs it if it's just the community like that totally explains why it hasn't been merged yet you know if nobody is is actually like getting paid to keep that up sometimes it's difficult but all right that's cool the build is in progress and we can monitor it here at this url let's see if let's copy and paste that once our build is ready oh sweet is it finished nice it is finished very cool okay so our build is finished let's go back to our documentation wait for the build to finish and build your actual project which is simulator flag then download the timeline given which we can't uh we can't simulate it on this device so test the device build with apple test flight download the file to your local machine upload the app to test flight which i don't know what test flight is um oh is this an app store thing beta testing made simple with test flight i guess i can't do it here we have this here we have this url here which that has our our build and oh hey we could i don't know if i could download this and test it all right that could take 10 to 15 minutes to build let's let's check out our i thought i had this open somewhere already said uploading apps yeah uploading apps to the app store if you choose to upload your ios app to test flight oh we can just do expo upload ios all right let's do this that feature works on mac os only all right so it looks like i can't do that manually uploading looks like i won't be able to do this hmm all right so it looks like i have to use this is this is somewhat misleading that i can build for ios on the um on windows but i can't submit is this correct does anybody have experience with this this seems like very odd um let's see store submit your is to absolute windows system 2017 get out of here it's too old uh i'm gonna check for anything in the past year let's make this bigger how to submit your app to the app store all right so this is microsoft all right so the first the first time it has to be i don't think that's going to help i think that's the same same problem we have right now hmm yeah that's not using windows all right so i guess what i have to do is let's switch this over see what i can do i'm going to see if i can uh hop on to this stream on my macbook i don't i usually don't stream from my macbook because the quality is is not great but i'd rather you be able to see what's going on all right all right let's see let me i'm going to briefly stop streaming here and then pick up my stream on my other computer i don't know i've never tried this before but uh we'll see how it goes maybe it'll work i have already downloaded this i don't think i'll need to do anything with the code so i think we're fine there but just in case i've already downloaded the repo i'm going to stop all right let's see uh all right can you all can you all see me or hear me let me know if you can hear me i think you can see me right now i'm going to try to shrink this window down sweet so evidently i can switch devices in the middle of the stream and it'll keep the stream going that's pretty sweet i need to figure out how to get this window to fit all right that's pretty close close enough all right let's go to my apple apple developer program and let's also go to expo dot io so i'll sign in to my expo account and then we'll be able to download we should be able to download the file that that we just created and oh you know what let me what was that thing that they said there was some sort of thing that i needed to get from the app store the transporter download transporter from the app store okay so i do want to get into here and i also want to get let's open up the app store and get transporter hopefully that's not a large install and i don't want to enroll i want to log in see if it'll let me log in um oh not this again two factor off all the time all right uh eight four five nine two five cool sure go ahead and trust it what's up app store nice transporter is here let's check out expo i hope the stream isn't lagging too much uh usually when i try to do stuff on my macbook one and stream it it does not work another code five six seven seven five nine all right so here's another tip when you're doing anything with the app store uh make sure you have your your phone ready because you're gonna get a million text messages sweet so we can add the app uh this is the one we want stay focused let's download it i will say the build for ios took significantly less time than the android build uh downloads nice seems really small um downloads nice there it is just put it in all right cool all right so it's going to do its thing and examine this and then at some point the button will come up to say deliver no suitable application records were found verify your bundle identifier com.jesus focus is correct hmm let's try that again i shouldn't have clicked off of that error i should have looked it up right away okay um let me let me look i'm gonna look this up on my other screen real quick just because i got more space over here um let's see there we go it the auto complete came up pretty quick so i think this is a common problem i see it on stack overflow okay all right for somebody it just seems like itunes connect click on my app plus sign new app fill out all the info choose your bundle id for the app you're uploading now maybe i have to do this maybe there's a step i have to do first um let's go to i know i i know it's already there okay actually it looks like let me switch back i think this this actually is working i just need to do a step now in the app store connect so i'm going to switch back to um all right let me know let me know if you can hear me or you can see anything happening seems like i'm back all right so you can see like before when i tried to add an app this screen did not come up and now it actually has my my bundle um so you see like this stuff so using the expo cli to upload said it would it would need this stuff anyway uh so now it just seems like obviously like i'm doing the manual thing so connect test flight actually i wonder now it's saying let me double check i didn't see a test flight option yeah it doesn't say test flight all right i'm just double checking i'm in the right place i think this is the right place so uh this is going to be ios stay focused primary language is going to be english although there's not really many words in the whole app the sku a unique id for your app store that is not visible in the app uh i don't know how to do this at app store sku we'll just generate one how to get the sku number all right all right so it seems like we just make up whatever we want so let's let's do that let's go let's just say stay focused one uh user access what's this you can limit which users see this app and the full connect i'm sorry if that made a big noise i accidentally hit my microphone all right it seems like full access is cool let's create that sweet all right privacy policy url oh you know what we made that url in the last video let's see if we can grab that from our um our google privacy policy yeah no i don't want to edit when i want to let's share copy link there we go all right cool minimize that there we go subtitle um long enough um subtitles option i'm not going to put it because i can't think of one right now all right there we go no age rating category primary one i would say is productivity i don't know what secondary is maybe i don't know it's optional i'm not going to put it see save that so it saves pricing and availability what do you think should i charge 20 bucks for this it's gonna be free i'm not gonna charge anything i don't think i can charge anyway because i didn't fill out all my all my stuff somebody said um we're losing the video oh no losing the video all right i'm sorry i haven't been keeping up that well with the uh with the channel or with the chat here for the stream all right cool price free all countries of region all right that looks good save that prepare for submission uh oh need to create uh let's see at preview app store um let's just see if we can find a generator is this one that we used before i think this was it and we had yeah this was it it was super easy to generate all the the ones that we needed and we used uh which ones did we use this one yeah we use these two cool oh i already have them maybe i already have them i just didn't realize uh probably downloads there we go no let me download it again because i thought back to editing device there we go iphone the site is not iphone oh they i think they want like better images hmm hmm what was the other one this might have been what i already have let's see yeah that looks like what i have let's just try to let's try to upload what i have um dimensions are wrong looks like i'm gonna have to go with some sort of other uh appsource screenshot designer hmm i don't want to log in wow there's a tornado warning in my area that's crazy just came up on my phone we usually don't get tornadoes here uh let's see fastlane automates that let me get rid of some of these windows and start over so this is definitely not making it the right dimensions what dimensions do i need all right so i need 1242 by 2688 saying fastlane should automate all that and get rid of some of this stuff here i don't think i can do this on windows screenshots there you go i don't know if i want to install all this stuff right now we're already coming up on almost two hours for the stream uh i think i want to maybe try to get the screenshots hmm the same ones come up apple screenshot builder by launch pad we tried this before i didn't want to do it but let's give it a shot there we go ios fine that looks good um hey app store url did that download did not look good app is not live yet there we go uh someone said someone's fighting behind you yeah it's probably my kids so well for one thing it is um raining so hard it looks like there's a waterfall outside my house coming off my roof it's it's really crazy there's a tornado warning um my kids are running upstairs because they're probably like looking out the window and are all excited by the storm actually if the internet cuts out and the video cuts out you know what happened because it's storming it's really crazy um so yeah things are pretty crazy hey the app screenshots are downloading let's open this up see what we got alright cool we got a lot of screenshots so that's pretty sweet extract okay all right so let's go back here and see if we can get these apps screenshots let's let's pick some actually which size i needed 6.5 inch right i don't want that one at least six five there you go let's just throw in a bunch of them right i need five five whoops i didn't mean to click that okay all right that looks good um promotional text i'm just going to grab what i had from google and put it in here oops i guess not i guess i'll put it in here promotional text um there we go um let's see support url i don't have one do i need one marketing url i don't have one uh looks like support url is going to be necessary i guess i could do jesse weigle.com all right let's see all right the transformer app that's i'm going to try to do this again and add the app see if it'll take it this time doing that on my other machine um icon choose a file for the app store icon let's use the one that we generated uh where's that oh we gotta go in here users projects stay focused oops and assets let's use that one this let's say no sign in required and attachment for what notes okay yay it worked i'm gonna hit deliver so see if if y'all can see this probably not anyway it just says it's delivering to the app store now so basically if you remember beforehand uh it was saying that it didn't match like the build id didn't match or something like that well we we had to do this stuff on this end before we could upload it in there so i'm gonna automatically release that and let's hit save here see we're not ready yet certainly because we didn't actually upload it so um we are uploading the build now i assume that once the build is uploaded then we'll actually see it here so the upload is happening i don't know how long it's supposed to take to do the upload um it did say something about like make sure you're connected to a power source while you do this i don't have my plug down here so i'm not going to connect to power source while i do that but i can go back and answer some questions here in the chat while we're waiting for that to upload seems like that's the last thing we need to do anyway is do the upload and then we i believe we've done everything else that's required uh yeah so we need to upload and then submit for review so i'm going to scroll up and try to figure out where i left off in the chat it's been a while let's see all right i think i found it uh john jonathan says uh hey jesse if you don't get by if you don't get to do the time management video today what is the rain check because it is taking lots of time indeed let's help him um yeah i i don't know when i'll do it i mean i'll try to get to it at some point this week i suppose abdullah says hi how are you how many people are here uh i'm doing all right finally got things to work so there's a little bit of a struggle but it's working and and believe it or not this is still way faster than the android uh build and deploy so it looks like we're 37 of the way through with the app upload so now 40 i think it's gonna happen pretty quick i'm assuming we'll see it on the screen maybe i'll have to refresh but uh it seems like we'll see it hey look there's the tesla thing cool now i see that what's new in test flight little builds oh cool we might get to see it here and run a test that'll be sweet let's we we should do that um all right oh abdallah actually asked as well how many people are on here actually right now there's only 56 but seemed like we had a lot more at some point wait we had my computer froze for a second there hopefully it didn't mess up the video too much um yeah we had at one point 190 viewers at a time so that's pretty sweet but right now right now we're at 52. um yeah i'm i figured we'd lose a lot of viewers because we had a lot of trouble sweet what is this sweet it said it was delivered so let me refresh this and see if we actually have oh is this the one that said something said that it might take a little while let's see the process can take a few minutes you can check the status you have submission test flight just click test right play and do your current builds all right i'll keep refreshing here every so often and um activity okay there's a build processing right now so uh i'll go back to the chat hopefully before i get through all the questions that'll be ready and we can run the the test flight that'll be cool i've never even seen that oh youtube's saying that the stream health is doing bad i hope my internet is not cutting out because of the storm oh well i'm gonna keep going do what i can uh where am i at okay sorry if i'm mispronouncing the name says how many years did it take to learn coding um i i'd say like it was a couple years before i started to get like really good at coding now i was like i was trying to do a lot at the time so i wasn't dedicated entirely to coding the entire time so when i first started out like getting paid to code i was also writing content so i was like a ghost writer for blogs i was doing search engine optimization work um like minor image editing stuff uh so there was um i was more of like uh like a multipurpose like media marketing type of person right so uh once i really started coding fulltime i leveled up very quickly so for me it was a couple years of coding and doing other things at the same time so if somebody could dedicate all their time to learning how to code they could probably get pretty good you know much more quickly um let's see jonathan asks someday can you talk about hardware installation of devices and streaming uh internet connections revisited um i probably could talk about hardware and stuff i don't know well i'd have to think about it what kind of like in particular kind of like what what type of stuff would you want to know about i never really thought about doing hardware see um kevin and i believe this is a different kevin than the one kevin that kept spamming the channel so kevin says uh which which platform do you deal with um web and mobile mainly so and that's via like react and react native um a question from id ids emerald i'm loving this i'm not really good in react but i would love to learn so can i learn from you um yeah sure i mean ask any questions you want during the stream hopefully you learned something for this particular stream we're not really doing much react like we build everything in react but this is more of like going through the the process the app store process i actually i really hope that i could save somebody some time um if they're trying to do a a build and stuff for the app store because we ran into some issues that that basically cost us a whole hour and it really shouldn't have it should have been like done in five minutes but it took an hour so if somebody sees this and is able to save an hour of work because of it then it'll definitely be worth it uh jonathan asks how did he grab the privacy policy uh so on the last stream i found the privacy policy generator and just used that and then saved it to my google docs and so then i just grabbed a uh a sharing link from the google google docs and put it in there so then i went in this stream and just clicked the link to that same google doc and mirandir mentioned that the test flight link is at the top left which i i saw it eventually but thank you for pointing that out i totally missed it at first uh strom stromboli kick says it's harder to upload the app than make the app you might be right i mean technically it did take us longer in terms of hours like to make the app but yeah it's uh it seems like it's gonna be when when like everything is all said and done it may end up being close to six hours sweet we got some progress we got the logo this is so processing nice it's here can i actually do something with it um um so will it will test flight run automatically in order to test the app you need to install the test flight ios app from the app store and sign in your chat buddy oh okay let me install that on my machine now wait oh no it's an ios app from the app store uh might need i might not be able to do tesla then because i don't have an ios device right now unless i could use unless i could use my wife i could text her real quick and see if i could borrow her phone let's see um all right go back to some questions uh deep sing says it's 11 where i am and i i'm kind of addicted by the way i guess that's cool you find it that interesting i guess uh so go check out cloud blocks what's what is cloud blocks uh amit pratap singh says i haven't stepped outside in seven days locked up this stream is the best thing to pay attention to well thank you all right well youtube's finally telling me that my stream health is back to being good so it actually says excellent that's that's cool let's see deepsync says i want to learn javascript but i'm 13. yeah you can definitely uh learn javascript at 13. um i've known some really good programmers that started out young and were good like very good in fact there was a uh a programmer who i believe was 14 when he started watching the streams and this was i've been streaming now for almost three years it'll be three years in april and um when i first started streaming like he started watching and was very very good and helped me a lot in the project i was working on and um he now he's uh i guess like 17 18 ish somewhere around there and um he already has a job with a company uh programming he's very good so yeah don't don't worry about you know only being 13 years old like get in there and and try to learn as much you can check out the tutorials on freecodecamp.org um that's that's part of like where i started out that's why i recommend everybody start out i think they're really good um and then depending on what how you like to learn you know check out some blogs uh videos like youtube videos um there are other online tutorials there are there are actually some good javascript books that are available for free like the ebook versions are available for free so there's a whole series called you don't know js there's a series called right i don't think it's a series i think it's one book called essential javascript um i believe that's what it's called i think there's like a peacock on the cover or something the like the online cover but yeah you know go for it and start building whatever you think is cool to work on oh okay he says um all this oh this was some other advice going free code can't finish the javascript course yeah so great advice it's same same thing i was thinking see i lost my place it skipped down on me uh black cat says hello everybody what do you think about angular uh i think it was fine i don't i don't really use angular but you know i know um you know good programmers that use it and build good stuff with it so uh certainly uh a valid option deepsync says what ide do you think is the best so ide is a integrated development environment if we want to consider vs code as an ide then i really like using vs code i work with some people that love visual studio um i know people that that really like some other you know other options but for me i've been using vs code for a couple years now and i i really like it it works very well for for javascript and typescript so i recommend that looks like my wife maybe does not have her phone on her right now because she didn't respond to my text message um micah says some say that there are more jobs in react than angular yeah i don't know the numbers for sure it i seem to see way more job listings for react than angular but it could be that i'm being targeted for react jobs because i am a react developer so i don't i don't really trust that too much and i don't know what the real numbers are let's see jonathan said oh you you ghost right i'm planning that while i love uh why code love to write both languages yeah i don't do any ghostwriting anymore but i used to um when i started out as a freelancer like i just i did whatever i could because i had i was married i already had two kids and i needed to pay the bills so i had to take care of my family so like whatever i could do for a client um like that had anything to do with websites i you know i would just do uh what mod randir says does uh react native equal react it does not if you want to know more about that i actually just did a video on my youtube channel that uh lets you know what the difference between react and react native is so you can check out that video the link to my channel is in the description of this video uh the short answer is they do they are not the same they share a lot in common but they are used for different things like primarily so if you want to know more check out that video i think it's less than 20 minute minutes long and i give some pretty simple examples of how they're they're different and how they're the same uh some someone asking uh people where they're from we have somebody from kenya someone from turkey someone asked if if we had a video uh in french i don't think we have any french language videos on the free code camp channel um i'm not sure what our our status is on subtitles um so apologies about that i really um primarily just speak english i know a little bit of some other languages but not nearly enough to do a video in oh no no we have people speaking in french in the chat i did take a french class once so i can say a few words in french okay so earlier somebody mentioned cloud blocks and i asked what that was and evidently cloudblocks is home automation so that's pretty cool uh haroon says it's it's uh 1108 pm in turkey and i'm gonna sleep thank you free code camp for these online courses see ya i'll see ya uh thanks for thanks for hanging in there and watching for so long uh eric asks for links where to start learning react uh go to freecodecamp.org and check out the lessons there there's a whole section on react i think it's a good intro jonathan says jesse thanks for the lifetime sharing and good luck thank you i appreciate that just going to get up because it's two hours they usually move uh around every hour for five minutes oh okay that's that's actually a good uh good thing to do um all right cool so i got through all the chat so i guess the my wife still didn't get back to me about borrowing her phone to do testing on so evidently this test flight thing is going to require me to download the test flight app on an iphone and missing compliance this build is missing export compliance information does your app use encryption if yes yes even if your app only uses standard encryption within apple just operating okay you know what there was something about what was it i remember there being some type of data look at this disclaimer at the top this feature works properly only on mac os i can't believe i missed that that would have saved a lot of time um where did i see it maybe it was on the build it was something about some special permissions where am i going to find it hmm i don't not see it maybe i have it open on my other computer i'm going to check really quick store review oh okay no it's different so i don't know what's exactly what the answer here i don't think that i use encryption if you're making use of ats or making calls to https you are required to submit a year and selfclassification report to us government maybe i am encrypting all right let's just say yes then does you have qualify for any of the exemptions providing category 5 part 2 of us export medical use yes this question if the encryption of your app is yes i think because it's limited to authentication digital signature decryption of data files i mean i'm pretty sure that the endpoints we hit to get data is https so that's the authentication part of it right so it's ready to test is this it right hmm oh maybe i have to do this okay i just did this actually privacy policy where was that at uh that's my other screen and i should policy all right there we go all right i don't really know expire bill who's this ready to submit let's see i'm gonna get back to the chat chat in just a minute one app store connect users add testers i wonder if i need to do this step like what if i went back to the app store and said i just want to upload this oh do i really need to add these okay so which one is this 12.9 inch display download tap screenshots what's this wait is this one 12.98 i guess i'll just send them both in all right let's see anything else age rating uh no no no no no no no no no no there we go all right cool well copyright name of the person or anything's exclusive rights to your app jesse be fancy about it put the middle initial all right now let's see if i got it does your app contain show or access thirdparty content no does the app use advertising identifier oh actually yeah i think this was it yes it you want to check the following three boxes so on my other screen i have this attribute app installation to a previously served advertisement attributing action taken yes there we go man i'm glad i remembered that page and brought that up cool so my app is officially submitted and ready for review now i don't know what's going to happen because uh we didn't test it on an actual device i wanted to but i didn't have a device so we'll see what happens uh i don't know if it said waiting for review i don't know if it says how long it will take no not really okay um so yeah not sure how long that will take but for now let me go back to the chat i'm gonna get through the rest of the questions and then we'll wrap this up let's see deep singh says uh what time is it there jesse um it is 4 26 p.m so you look tired do i look tired after all the trouble shooting i think it just kind of got to me so i i i kind of feel tired uh jonathan jonathan asks can you emulate mac on uh pc i don't know if i can emulate a mac you can do like uh like a dual boot i believe i mean you can make they call it like a hackintosh and run mac os on a pc but i don't know i could just run mac in the pc i thought about maybe if i could do some sort of remote desktop thing then i could do stuff on my mac while i'm still on here i might look into that for future streams if i if i really have to do like ios stuff um deep says uh i'm actually surprised on how long it's stressful it is for people to put up their apps uh most youtubers out there show it as a piece of cake yeah it is it's harder than i thought it would be as well i think though now that i've done it this is the first time i ever did the app store the apple app store and then the last stream was the first time i ever did it on the google play store so having done it once now on each store i think doing it the second time would be way faster so you know knowing what to expect ahead of time will definitely help so i think i could do both stores like in less than an hour now assuming that like the the builds worked and everything eric says thanks for the info i will let all the other guys who are learning to code with me know that there's a free code camp website oh yeah awesome yeah definitely share the info uh is there anything else i should know um yeah i would start with free code camps lessons they have links to a lot of other resources as well i think it's a great place to start and um you know it's all completely free but uh do that there's enough lessons there that you know you could learn a lot just from from that website and then branch out like the free code camp youtube channel that you obviously know about because you're watching uh has a ton of great content uh free code camp has a forum and blogs um and you know they like they often link to other content too that's not just free code camp content so you'll you'll get an idea for where the good good stuff is deep says how much longer is this live stream going to go for uh i'd say just a few more minutes i'm almost to the end of the chat here and basically did everything we need at that point d says my mom wants me to sleep yeah you'll be just a couple more minutes we'll be done uh nerosity uh commented and that's who the company that makes the headset the brain computer headset says hashtag crushed thank you i appreciate it took longer than i than i thought um aj says if you do the test flight i'm happy to test on my device oh that's awesome um yeah i don't know how to i'm not really sure how to have other people test like i could add an external tester app store connect users i guess i could add myself um so i guess i've been invited now to test that's cool um anyway we could uh aj we could talk about it later too if you want to about what i need i guess i just need your email to add you or for external i don't really know i have to look into that more but that would be cool uh alexander says i have a little time just answer me one question how unit testing and react what is your experience with unit testing like you know what to be honest with you i tried to do unit testing and react but i found that i don't i don't see much value in it uh if you are doing endtoend tests i think the endtoend tests are much more valuable and um really make the unit test kind of obsolete all right so my internet cut out completely just a second ago it's lightning storming lightning storm all right my daughter just said it's lightning there's lightning so it cut out so i'm gonna i'm gonna get off here um let's see uh deep says it's now 11 31 here but i'm still happy to be here all right well i'm gonna i'm gonna finish up because i don't know how much longer my internet's going to uh going to work anyway so see y'all later uh thanks so much for hanging in here for this stream and um hopefully i'll be back at some point this week with some more streams and with gemma okay
