00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're
00:09 - gonna do some design and dev work on a
00:12 - home page for our react site and we're
00:15 - using material design and we have a
00:18 - framework called material UI that we're
00:21 - using to build things out so we're gonna
00:23 - be working with that and all the codes
00:27 - available there's a link in the
00:28 - description and I thought I'd start out
00:31 - today by giving a very brief overview of
00:34 - the project since we haven't done an
00:37 - overview for a while or on this is the
00:40 - thirty-fifth
00:41 - stream I believe so we're pretty far
00:45 - into this project and I know some of you
00:49 - are kind of jumping in in the middle so
00:52 - let me give just a really quick
00:53 - breakdown and that'll give everybody a
00:56 - chance to join in as well if they're
00:58 - just getting their notifications that
01:01 - we've gone live so we have a react site
01:07 - that we build with next j/s primarily we
01:10 - went with next j/s because it offers
01:13 - very easy server-side rendering we have
01:20 - all our content housed in a wordpress
01:25 - installation so that means it's a my
01:27 - sequel database on WordPress we have the
01:31 - WP graph QL plug-in and that allows us
01:35 - to pull data from that my sequel
01:37 - database with graph QL and bring it into
01:42 - our react application so whenever we
01:45 - grab data we're almost exclusively using
01:48 - graph QL the reason we went with
01:52 - WordPress is because it's very easy for
01:54 - people who don't really know a lot about
01:57 - code to input content so that's why we
02:02 - went with that it's also very stable and
02:06 - has a large user base so we made a
02:11 - custom plugin to
02:13 - of us a lot of different post types and
02:16 - taxonomies if you're not familiar with
02:18 - WordPress you know terminology and
02:20 - things it's just you know different ways
02:22 - for us to house our data and to make it
02:24 - very simple for people who are managing
02:28 - content to know where to put the data
02:31 - and that's that's it I mean that that's
02:36 - pretty much the overview of where we're
02:39 - at we've had some other steps along the
02:41 - way we've had to migrate some data but
02:44 - overall that's the structure of of the
02:47 - project so far so right now I'm at the
02:55 - point in the project where I need to
02:56 - make it look nice enough to present it
03:00 - to some people here at the university
03:01 - that I work for so I'd like to have that
03:06 - presentable looking by tomorrow morning
03:09 - and then I'll have a meeting my first of
03:14 - several meetings where I get to display
03:16 - this so that's where we're at right now
03:18 - if anyone has any questions about how we
03:22 - set anything up let me know I could at
03:24 - least point you to the stream where we
03:28 - set that up so you can watch the setup
03:29 - process yourself or I can you know take
03:32 - a few minutes and explain it let's see
03:42 - just want to say hi and read through a
03:44 - little bit in the live chat now before
03:46 - we start to see if there's anything I
03:48 - should address now okay great
03:55 - so Niki has some advice for my
03:57 - presentations about is just to talk
03:59 - about its value to the visitors not only
04:01 - its features
04:03 - alright that's that's really good advice
04:05 - if anyone has any advice for me when I
04:08 - go to present the site please let me
04:10 - know I'm gonna be talking to different
04:12 - groups so one group is going to be
04:14 - people that are like in charge of the
04:16 - university and another group is gonna be
04:18 - people who are primarily they interact
04:21 - with the students they're in charge of
04:22 - the student life Department I think I
04:26 - might do I don't think I'm gonna meet
04:28 - with faculty members I think I'm gonna
04:30 - do like a live stream for faculty
04:33 - members we're gonna call it a webinar
04:35 - because that's more like with their
04:38 - terminology that they're used to so
04:41 - that's depending on the group I may
04:46 - focus a little bit more on different
04:48 - features I even thought about kind of
04:49 - changing some of the content we have on
04:51 - the homepage for different groups but I
04:55 - don't want to get too far ahead of
04:56 - myself we still have some work to do
04:57 - right now so let me switch over so that
05:00 - you all can see what I'm saying on on
05:02 - one of my screens here so here's the
05:06 - code let me just catch you up on what
05:08 - I've done I've created this list card
05:11 - component which we we did a lot of the
05:14 - styling for that yesterday but I've
05:16 - split it out into a component yeah this
05:19 - is too small make it a little bigger
05:22 - okay and let me try to get as much out
05:25 - of the way as we can so here's the new
05:31 - component and all the code is up to date
05:33 - in in github so if you click the link
05:37 - below you'll be able to see it and you
05:40 - can also see the website if I start this
05:43 - and Rock server you'll be able to check
05:46 - out the website on your own computer
05:50 - there it is so if you can view the live
05:54 - chat there's a link now in the live chat
05:56 - to check out this site unfortunately if
06:00 - you're watching later on this and Rock
06:03 - server probably won't be running so you
06:05 - won't have access to it otherwise I
06:08 - would put the link in the description as
06:10 - well and I can for those of you who
06:17 - can't see the site right now I'm gonna
06:19 - pull this over and I we're primarily
06:26 - doing the mobile view of the site right
06:28 - now so I've been kind of showing it at
06:32 - this view and this is a very small phone
06:36 - so the odds of somebody having a phone
06:38 - like this are low but I really want to
06:40 - make sure it looks all right on all
06:42 - different devices so you may notice some
06:46 - differences I'll try to point them out
06:48 - as I go through so we still have the the
06:51 - cute little dog as our background
06:54 - picture which we need to get rid of that
06:57 - I keep putting it off because I'm hoping
06:59 - that someone else in my department will
07:02 - send me a picture that they really think
07:04 - would work it hasn't happened yet but
07:09 - I'd rather not spend a lot of time going
07:10 - through pictures because they I can
07:12 - spend a lot of time on that so one thing
07:14 - that I did do is I changed the way we're
07:16 - bringing in YouTube embeds so before
07:19 - material.you I already has a media card
07:22 - component where you could put in the URL
07:26 - that you want to use and what component
07:29 - you want to use in our case we were
07:31 - passing in as a prop iframe and we were
07:34 - also passing in the source so that was
07:39 - okay but the problem was it was acting
07:41 - like we were hovering the entire time so
07:43 - if you see it's not letting me do it
07:46 - here for some reason when I inspect this
07:51 - with dev tools it doesn't have the same
07:53 - hover effect but anyway when you hover
07:56 - the YouTube button is entirely red
07:59 - whereas normally it's let me refresh
08:01 - can see this normally again so oh well
08:06 - now it's doing it for some reason I keep
08:11 - getting this always red button maybe
08:15 - it's because it's mobile sorry I think
08:18 - that's the issue yeah okay so on mobile
08:22 - we can't really do anything about it but
08:23 - when we have more of a desktop view we
08:26 - have this semi-transparent button and
08:29 - then it only goes red when you hover so
08:32 - for some reason when we use the material
08:35 - UI component like it was always red I
08:38 - couldn't get it to change so now I just
08:40 - have a card where I directly put an
08:42 - iframe in it works and it doesn't really
08:46 - add anything to the code so I think it's
08:48 - fine but you may see a difference in the
08:52 - code I would switch it back here I've
08:56 - changed out so a lot of the silly filler
09:00 - content that I had in there I'm gonna
09:02 - have to take out so I'm starting to put
09:07 - in like real facts we built this card
09:10 - out before so here's what I came up with
09:13 - for that list component now I know this
09:16 - all probably looks really small on your
09:18 - screen so I encourage you to use that
09:20 - anger out link if you can but anyway so
09:25 - we have the events list here we have
09:28 - some data and we have some options so if
09:31 - you don't pass in an image then it goes
09:35 - full width like this which I think works
09:37 - better when you have more content also
09:41 - you don't have to pass in the secondary
09:43 - text if you don't want to so you just
09:45 - have you should kind of show on a few of
09:47 - the options that we have here
09:49 - I'm still thinking that I'd like to
09:51 - display the date of these events
09:53 - somewhere but I also think it's time for
09:56 - me to move on and get this page looking
09:59 - like it's completed and then if I have
10:01 - time I can go back and add in some
10:02 - details so the rest I do still have some
10:07 - of those that filler content in here so
10:11 - today what I'd like to do is go
10:15 - and maybe make some real content for
10:22 - some of these pieces and also work on
10:25 - see some of the details so as we go
10:30 - through I'll point out some of the
10:31 - details that I still don't like about
10:33 - how this looks and and we'll fix those
10:39 - all right okay so that's what we started
10:44 - I'm going to start with Pomodoro clock
10:49 - so I may reset this so I'd like to break
10:56 - up the work in Pomodoro sessions so
10:59 - we're going to do 25 minutes of code and
11:00 - then I'll take a five-minute break I'll
11:02 - go back to the live chat oh I got to say
11:05 - this out loud though Ruben says how is
11:08 - it possible to be so handsome I I'm
11:15 - gonna assume that that was directed
11:17 - towards me and that I am the one that is
11:20 - so handsome so I don't know I you could
11:28 - thank the person that cuts my hair also
11:34 - my mom and dad they probably had
11:37 - something to do with the handsomeness
11:38 - I'm just I'm just messing around
11:43 - I'm sure that was probably a joke but it
11:46 - still feels good to get comments like
11:48 - that so thank you okay so let's get into
11:55 - some of the code first off let's put in
11:59 - a little bit more content and I'm gonna
12:00 - run some ideas by you about you know
12:02 - kind of what I'm thinking we have right
12:07 - now especially in this view it's just a
12:10 - lot of content you know like right in a
12:12 - row it kind of works but I'm I don't
12:18 - know if my boss will like this idea or
12:19 - not but I'm thinking about maybe we can
12:23 - split up the content into some sections
12:26 - I'm
12:28 - I don't know I'm on the fence about that
12:32 - one and I'm not sure that's something I
12:33 - can get done before a presentation but
12:36 - it seems to me like sections might help
12:40 - break things up a little bit and make
12:42 - more sense of this content so as we're
12:45 - going through if you see some I don't
12:50 - know some pattern to things where you
12:51 - think a section of it might be good let
12:53 - me know I know that's pretty vague I
12:56 - just had the idea you know an hour or
12:58 - two ago so I'm still kind of thinking
13:00 - about it as well but all right one
13:03 - detail that I really like to change that
13:05 - keeps bothering me so let's just change
13:07 - it right now is I really want this logo
13:09 - to be centered I don't know that bothers
13:12 - anybody else but on a larger screen I
13:15 - think it looks fine to be over here but
13:17 - when it's this small it it's close
13:20 - enough to the center that it looks weird
13:23 - let me know if you disagree with that
13:26 - but I just think it it looks like it's
13:29 - supposed to be centered but it's
13:30 - off-center to me only when it's this
13:32 - small though so first thing I'm going to
13:36 - do is just inspect this in dev tools
13:38 - which if you are viewing this through
13:41 - that and Rock link you should be able to
13:44 - do this as well and so let's see what
13:49 - the container is this will help to
13:54 - figure out mm-hmm all right I don't like
14:00 - that so the container that's large
14:05 - enough to actually you make this go to
14:08 - the middle is this container here this
14:11 - div but the div also contains this
14:13 - button I don't want the button to be
14:17 - centered so let's see what we can do
14:26 - alright let's check out how this really
14:28 - is in the component right because
14:32 - material UI is changing these into some
14:35 - dips but let's see what the the
14:37 - component actually looks like so this is
14:40 - probably going to be in our app bar
14:54 - let's see the app over here Wow the app
15:01 - bar is quite a large component I haven't
15:03 - done anything with the app bar in a
15:05 - while so here's our logo and let's see
15:12 - is this the making sure we should have
15:17 - two places with a logo one of them is
15:20 - going to be the drawer so but I think we
15:22 - have that in a separate component
15:36 - interesting that's really interesting
15:40 - how we did that
15:49 - hmm
15:54 - I can i I'm looking at this I you you
16:04 - all can probably see already but I'm
16:06 - kind of puzzled looking at this that I
16:07 - did it this way so I probably copied
16:12 - over an example from the material UI
16:14 - documentation which had typography as an
16:20 - element in the app bar and it was
16:23 - probably just some text and then what I
16:25 - did instead of replacing typography with
16:28 - another element I just added this image
16:31 - element inside of the typography element
16:36 - I don't know that that's this may be a
16:43 - waste of of this element here so I'm
16:47 - gonna try to do a little bit let's let's
16:50 - say refactoring here and maybe clean
16:53 - this up and see what happens so what I'd
16:56 - like to do is let's see what with this
17:00 - classes flex is going right now to see
17:05 - if we should keep it or we can get rid
17:08 - of it so let's find flex okay so it's
17:12 - just saying flex one for that all right
17:16 - let's
17:28 - and then you button
17:36 - this is classes two column one class I
17:45 - wonder if we should have two different
17:48 - structures one for small screen and one
17:51 - for a large screen
18:02 - I see some more of you saying hi in the
18:05 - live chat hey thanks for watching thanks
18:07 - for joining in okay so here was my
18:10 - thought if I go changing this it's not
18:13 - only going to change for the mobile view
18:15 - it's going to change for the desktop
18:16 - view I don't want the desktop view to
18:18 - change so I need to not just start
18:20 - deleting things ideally what I would be
18:24 - able to do is just take one of these
18:27 - classes like let's take a look at the
18:29 - header image class for an example and
18:36 - use a media query or the the mature UI
18:42 - version of a media query which I'll show
18:45 - you an example in just a second and just
18:50 - change the style like that so I I think
18:54 - that'll be the best way to go for now
18:57 - even though I really don't like that to
18:59 - typography element maybe now when is
19:02 - this close to the presentation isn't the
19:04 - time for me to be going in and just
19:05 - trying things and hoping they don't
19:07 - break and I can't find that header image
19:12 - there we are okay
19:19 - that's it huh and they see where where
19:24 - that was that okay so that actually is
19:26 - on the image that's iPod Rafi
19:39 - alright let's go back to dev tools play
19:42 - around just a little bit I I kind of
19:44 - think we're gonna have to change the
19:46 - structure of this if it was just
19:50 - structured slightly different this
19:52 - wouldn't be as big of a deal
20:03 - all right so with so this is the yeah
20:18 - all right let's try this with so okay so
20:27 - the problem was these containers weren't
20:32 - yeah this isn't going to work with this
20:34 - structure so we can we can set the
20:37 - alignment to be centered but you see the
20:42 - the container here is is already
20:44 - off-center so we're not gonna get it to
20:46 - be centered exactly with the element
20:50 - like that
20:57 - if we took it out of the flow though and
21:02 - it's just sticky no the snap isn't
21:04 - sticky and maybe it should be all right
21:11 - I have an idea
21:12 - here's my idea and I'm gonna say before
21:16 - I do it so that you all can stop me if
21:18 - it's a silly idea alright so number one
21:22 - I think it makes sense for this knife to
21:24 - be sticky on mobile because there's a
21:28 - lot of scrolling going on here it would
21:30 - be nice to be able to just get to the
21:32 - menu without having to scroll back up I
21:34 - I would appreciate that so I think at
21:38 - the very least on mobile that we should
21:39 - have a sticky navigation or fixed
21:42 - navigation whatever you prefer maybe
21:47 - even on desktop that might be the way to
21:48 - go but at least on mobile we should do
21:51 - that secondly if we're going to do a
21:54 - fixed navigation we could just position
21:59 - this thing differently so that all right
22:04 - like potentially we might be able to
22:06 - just take it out of the flow right now
22:10 - so we'll see how this works but let's
22:17 - alright good so I'm getting some
22:19 - feedback so Nikki says make it thinner
22:21 - while scrolling it's a personal
22:23 - preference I dislike all the space that
22:24 - it consumes okay yeah I I agree with
22:29 - that I agree so first things first let's
22:33 - make it sticky and then we can try to
22:37 - shrink it a little bit I I definitely
22:39 - think we can shrink it it's there's a
22:41 - lot of white space happening this logo
22:43 - could be smaller and still be perfectly
22:47 - readable so let's do that
22:54 - a new Java version I would remind me
22:58 - later I don't even know why I have job
23:00 - on here I I'm not sure if I actually use
23:05 - anything that needs it I suspect the
23:15 - material I probably already has a class
23:18 - that will make this fixed so let's just
23:21 - see if we can add that class before I
23:22 - try to do it on my own or is I know I
23:29 - have the material ID documentation
23:31 - already open air we are in at least one
23:33 - place I probably have it open multiple
23:36 - places do you ever get to that point on
23:39 - your desktop that it's faster just to
23:43 - search just to open a new tab and go to
23:46 - a website than to try to find what
23:49 - website what tab like you already have
23:51 - open with that website in there I said
23:54 - that really awkwardly hopefully made
23:56 - sense but that's where I'm at right now
23:58 - is that I know I have certain websites
24:01 - open but I just don't know where so I
24:04 - end up just opening up opening them up
24:06 - again let's check out the app bar and
24:10 - let's see fixed awesome so we can do
24:15 - position what's the difference between
24:20 - sticky note sticky is not universally
24:23 - supported and we'll fullback the static
24:25 - little bit different options just going
24:28 - to be all right yeah I want to see what
24:29 - the options are
24:40 - okay so stickies experimental all right
24:44 - I remember seeing this before so
24:47 - stickies for everything you know
24:54 - interesting and it falls back to static
25:01 - otherwise let's see what sticky is
25:07 - supported by so position sticky so edge
25:17 - supports it
25:20 - Firefox partially supports it okay not
25:25 - supported on table supported on thn us
25:29 - safari supports it all right let's use
25:33 - to this and sticky because we have
25:35 - pretty good support yeah I like the
25:42 - support on this
25:49 - all right cool if you've never been to
25:53 - can I use calm before it's very very
25:56 - useful super-easy one thing I really
25:58 - like is as soon as you go there your
26:00 - cursors automatically put right here so
26:03 - you soon as it loads you can just start
26:05 - typing and you don't even you know it
26:08 - just searches as you as you go so really
26:12 - simple and fast and you would just
26:14 - immediately know whether or not you know
26:17 - a specific thing in CSS or JavaScript or
26:20 - HTML will work also if you're not using
26:26 - mdn so Mozilla developer Network you
26:32 - should definitely check it out usually
26:34 - as way more information than I need but
26:36 - the examples are super useful so those
26:41 - are if you only take away two things
26:43 - from this stream those two things will
26:46 - be more helpful to you probably than
26:47 - anything else that I do okay and I know
26:55 - I'm not keeping up with the live chat
26:57 - right now in about ten minutes or so I'm
26:59 - gonna check back in the live chat and
27:01 - see what what I've been missing and
27:03 - respond to any questions all right so
27:07 - let's add that in this app bar it's a
27:14 - position yeah it was position so instead
27:16 - of static we're gonna type in sticky
27:20 - give that a save and see what happens
27:30 - alright nothing so far maybe I need to
27:34 - put in some more information what
27:37 - happened to that did I seriously close
27:40 - material UI mister now you can see all
27:47 - my browsing history right temp is from I
27:59 - did I not close it
28:05 - Wow ok I don't know what I did with it
28:13 - easy to get back to the app let's look
28:18 - at the API sticky
28:34 - all right maybe we will go to the demos
28:36 - because it doesn't explain what else I'm
28:42 - it seems to me like there needs to be
28:44 - some other indicator of like when is it
28:47 - supposed to go sticky simply button mmm
28:55 - alright it looks like none of these are
29:00 - sticky yeah these are all position
29:06 - static let me check you're looking for
29:12 - position fig stickies useful phone and
29:14 - bars that are down a bit and stick to
29:16 - the top after you scroll oh that's what
29:21 - the sticky is then nevermind I feel
29:26 - silly now okay I was thinking that
29:34 - sticky would give us something at an
29:35 - option like the app bar would just yeah
29:39 - I don't know what I was thinking
29:41 - thanks sneaky all right let's go to a
29:47 - position fixed I was just excited to use
29:51 - something new
29:58 - I know okay we got to do unexpected but
30:04 - I should have expected it so our content
30:06 - now since the app bar is gone has gone
30:11 - to a fixed position all of our content
30:16 - has now gone up to the top of the page
30:18 - so we need you you think material you I
30:23 - would have already had something to take
30:25 - that into account let's see
30:42 - oh whoa
30:51 - let's check out the layout
30:58 - [Music]
30:59 - what's this portal
31:10 - uh-huh that's I haven't seen that
31:12 - component before all right let's let's
31:22 - take a bar and where's our main let's go
31:30 - back to our layout component and this is
31:38 - where we bring in the app bar and then
31:40 - we have everything else falls in this
31:42 - main component here so if we go up to
31:45 - classes main right now it's the only
31:48 - thing we have on there is this flex so
31:51 - what we want to do then is set a margin
31:59 - top yeah I guess margin to work and we
32:07 - want the margin top to be the same
32:12 - height as the a bar but I'd like them to
32:17 - always be I want them to always be the
32:25 - same let's check our app bar component
32:38 - I'm checking to see if we have a height
32:41 - set already I guess we don't it's kind
32:52 - of odd I would have expected that
33:15 - let's go back here and see okay we do
33:20 - have this is that root component which
33:25 - basically is is just a container
33:26 - component here see what we're getting
33:32 - our height from so from somewhere in
33:39 - here then
33:52 - okay so some of our height at least is
33:55 - is set here by this icon to 48 pixels
33:59 - are that makes sense let's see where we
34:04 - can put height at if I'm confusing you
34:07 - right now then hold on just it's going
34:12 - to make a lot of sense once I actually
34:13 - do it assuming that it works and I think
34:16 - it'll be easier to see it then for me to
34:18 - explain it
34:37 - that's interesting
34:43 - okay that's pretty cool and interesting
34:47 - let's see header
35:06 - okay the way this is set up is not gonna
35:10 - make it easy to do to change the height
35:15 - all right let's see you're searching for
35:25 - a component that when I add a height it
35:28 - would actually make make a change all
35:39 - right maybe this is not gonna work out
35:41 - like the way I wanted to work out all
35:46 - right so basically we can have it be
35:49 - fixed and have everything work if we
35:53 - just put a height of 65 on our root
36:01 - component
36:13 - right and what do we do on layout
36:21 - whatever I did on layout I need to
36:24 - change okay all right my timer went off
36:29 - so it's time for me to go to the live
36:32 - chat but we can see we now have our
36:35 - fixed app bar and yeah that definitely
36:42 - needs to be smaller but in any case we
36:49 - have it fixed now okay we've gotten
36:54 - deeper and deeper into this whole of
36:56 - like all I wanted to do is make this
36:58 - centered and it's now become so much
37:03 - more complicated all right let me set a
37:06 - five-minute timer then and I'm gonna
37:08 - scroll up to the top of the live chat go
37:10 - down I'm gonna try to get to as many
37:11 - comments and questions as I can see
37:27 - Gander 7 says have you seen visual
37:29 - studio live sharing you can code
37:31 - collaboratively between visual studio
37:34 - code and visual studio even even sharing
37:38 - a session code visual studio comm
37:41 - alright as the rest of the URL there
37:43 - okay cool I'll have to check that up I
37:45 - have not used it yet John says I got
37:55 - p.m. today
37:56 - a painting question I answered honestly
37:58 - then I was destroyed with a horrible
38:00 - lashing out so Jessie it's nice to come
38:03 - here where people are civilized oh I'm
38:07 - really sorry that happened to you
38:09 - but yeah I'm never gonna lash out at
38:12 - anyone in Chad even if you said
38:15 - something that made me really mad
38:18 - I would I would still try my best to
38:21 - just be chill about it and I probably
38:23 - just blocked you if I thought that it
38:26 - was harming the the experience in the
38:29 - live chat but anyway I've been trying to
38:34 - be really chill about everything lately
38:37 - not in a live chat in particular
38:40 - obviously in the live chat but just in
38:42 - general especially with my kids because
38:45 - they're all little and so been trying to
38:48 - just be really calm and keep it like a
38:52 - nice tone of voice with you know even if
38:56 - I'm mad so anyway this is definitely a
39:01 - nice calm place to be in so if you're
39:07 - joining us for the first time you might
39:09 - not know that but feel free to ask any
39:12 - questions even no matter how basic you
39:15 - know you think they are nobody's going
39:18 - to get mad at you for it or be mean
39:20 - about it and if they are then if they're
39:23 - really really mean and they won't stop I
39:25 - block them if they're mean though I
39:28 - usually say something you know kind of
39:30 - politely you know tell people to be nice
39:38 - let's see Grimlock er says can I ask
39:41 - which is better for me to study
39:43 - bootstrap or angular I'm still new okay
39:45 - well it looks like you did get some
39:48 - answers already and the answers are
39:50 - pretty good so Joey says bootstrap and
39:52 - angular 2 different types of tools and
39:54 - yeah that's that's a hundred percent
39:56 - correct so bootstrap is for user
40:01 - interface so like design it's basically
40:04 - like a prebuilt design framework that
40:06 - you can use you know they're their
40:08 - components angular is that's hard to
40:15 - explain especially I guess if you're
40:18 - just starting out yeah but basically the
40:23 - the easy answer the quick answer is you
40:26 - can certainly study both at the same
40:28 - time because they do two different
40:29 - things you can use bootstrap with
40:32 - angular you could use it on its own and
40:36 - the same thing you can use angular on
40:38 - its own they do different things so if
40:44 - you'd like to learn them both go ahead
40:46 - if you want to they're learn one or the
40:48 - other that's fine but you you don't use
40:51 - them for the same thing if you want me
40:56 - to go more in-depth into the differences
40:58 - please let me know I can do that but I
40:59 - don't want to spend too much time going
41:03 - to the question if if no one's
41:05 - interested in it
41:19 - ah no says I agree with the fixed
41:22 - navigation or a button you can click and
41:24 - it will send you the top that's another
41:26 - good option that's a good option as well
41:29 - if a wonderful interior you I have
41:31 - something like that built-in I know I've
41:33 - done that on other sites I'm not sure
41:35 - I've done it with the react site yet but
41:39 - so I have some code that's probably
41:42 - jQuery that we could maybe adapt to do
41:44 - that or hopefully material I have
41:46 - something like that left to see let me
41:49 - know what y'all think is it better to
41:50 - just have a button that sends you to the
41:52 - top like a very small you know button
41:55 - that would maybe pop up after you scroll
41:58 - so far you know just just maybe in the
42:00 - bottom right-hand corner it would pop up
42:02 - or is it better to have that fixed
42:05 - navbar that follows you all the way down
42:10 - let's see John Henson says where make
42:14 - just the hamburger fixed okay just the
42:17 - hamburger icon that's interesting I
42:20 - wonder how that would look
42:24 - Stewart says just close the tabs okay
42:36 - a noble and Savage is all right so if
42:40 - you all remember whenever I was talking
42:42 - about how I had all my tabs open and
42:44 - it's easier just to search for something
42:47 - like in my browser then they have to
42:50 - find the tab that's open a noble site
42:54 - and savage says inspects memory
42:55 - footprint of browser your browsers using
42:57 - 5.3 gigabytes of RAM you laugh at that
43:01 - but if I saw that I wouldn't be
43:02 - surprised at all I think my browser is
43:07 - always the using the most RAM out of
43:10 - anything all right I'm gonna check I
43:19 - only have a few more comments here in
43:20 - the live chat so let me check out a few
43:22 - of these comments before we go back to
43:24 - the code
43:32 - Michael D or G I'm not sure I pronounce
43:37 - the last name there if you let me know
43:39 - I'll try to pronounce it correctly but
43:41 - anyway the question is I just started
43:44 - using material UI version 1 I notice the
43:46 - button element doesn't have an on-click
43:48 - attribute so how do you trigger on click
43:49 - events with a with buttons for Redux
43:52 - actions etc how do i sorry
44:02 - I'm always yawning on these streams I
44:05 - really sorry you know what I'm not I'm
44:13 - not really sure how I handle buttons
44:15 - it's usually they got it you got to be
44:25 - able to use one click with a button
44:27 - right we had to have done this before
44:31 - with something let me think about that
44:35 - we may actually come across a button in
44:37 - the stream today if anybody remembers
44:42 - how we've handled buttons in previous
44:45 - projects please put it in the live chat
44:49 - because I know we've done stuff like
44:51 - that before and we have use on click
44:53 - things so I just can't remember right
44:56 - now if we had any issues with that
45:09 - uh-uh Ruben says the handsome comment
45:13 - wasn't a joke you've got a good
45:15 - phenotype I envy that beard
45:19 - alright cool well thank you I appreciate
45:21 - it and yeah well I just I got my beard
45:26 - trimmed yesterday and I got a haircut so
45:27 - it probably looks okay right now
45:29 - normally it I let it go and it gets rid
45:32 - of bushy and wild but right now it's
45:37 - like looks slightly less wild but I said
45:44 - I appreciate the comment though alright
45:49 - so we do have some some other opinions
45:50 - on this navbar so hmm it was the sticky
46:00 - never would look a little nicer small
46:09 - button fading as usuals down alright so
46:16 - maybe we don't go with the fixed navbar
46:21 - I'm getting getting some some opinions
46:24 - against the the fixed navbar here
46:34 - I wanted to see how this looks
46:38 - oh okay so the fix and a bar also messed
46:43 - up some stuff for us here so that was
46:52 - unexpected all right let's go back here
46:56 - and resort layout I don't know where yet
47:08 - yeah this is what we did it let's go
47:11 - back to static save that and verify that
47:21 - this now works no what the heck oh you
47:31 - know we changed some other stuff so
47:33 - that's probably why it's not it's not
47:35 - gonna work all right what else do we
47:37 - change oh yeah so we're getting some
47:44 - there's some more opinions about fixed
47:47 - nav bars being annoying if they're too
47:49 - thick yeah so we could make it thinner
47:53 - or I'm I don't know I'm thinking now
47:57 - maybe we could just avoid having to like
48:01 - deal with this like cascade of issues
48:03 - that we're seeing here if we just go
48:05 - with that button that scroll to top
48:06 - button this also seems like something
48:10 - that could wait until after the
48:11 - presentation so it's probably something
48:13 - that doesn't need to be done right now
48:14 - so I'll just keep in mind to try to find
48:17 - a component that that'll give us that
48:23 - scroll to top or some other solution but
48:27 - I think I've got myself into like too
48:29 - much stuff considering I have a
48:32 - presentation tomorrow I think it's at
48:35 - 11:00 a.m. tomorrow what the heck is
48:39 - this healing from why are we importing
48:49 - healing that that stuff my mistake when
48:55 - did that change
48:58 - alright let me just go back
49:10 - hidden there we go I accidentally
49:15 - changed that so alright good
49:20 - okay this is back to normal
49:27 - alright so we're back to normal here we
49:32 - are whoops
49:35 - switch it to here we're right back where
49:38 - we started and that is how do we make
49:41 - this centered all right let me take a
49:49 - drink and let's start over for all of
50:00 - you that are new to the stream one of
50:03 - the biggest features of this stream that
50:07 - makes it stand out from other streams is
50:09 - that I don't rehearse anything so
50:12 - mistakes can and do happen often and
50:16 - this is my everyday work so we worked
50:20 - through the mistakes together I just
50:26 - realized that I also forgot to start my
50:29 - timer again so let's start the timer all
50:39 - right now let's go back to this
50:57 - all right so our mission is get this
51:00 - logo centered on small screens what
51:05 - we're not gonna do is change the we're
51:12 - not we're doing to try to change as
51:13 - little as possible in this app bar okay
51:19 - ha ha Ruben says I heard centering
51:22 - things is half the job of a front-end
51:23 - dev it certainly seems like that today
51:26 - doesn't it all right so let's go back to
51:32 - our app bar component where we actually
51:34 - have this and let's see what we can do
51:45 - let's see if
52:02 - let's see if we can add a set of media
52:06 - queries to the classes that we're
52:08 - already using that that change some of
52:14 - the values that may work so here's what
52:20 - we're gonna do the image itself
52:38 - that's interesting it looks like the
52:42 - link is only on the bottom half of this
52:45 - let's see if that's correct hmm let's
52:54 - let's open this up so I can actually see
53:00 - all right yeah let's go to a new page
53:17 - oh no that did work cool all right I'm
53:22 - not worried about that anymore as I was
53:25 - scrolling through here it looked like
53:26 - the link tag would not work but it did
53:37 - all right so let's start here and let's
53:42 - see we probably already did this I don't
53:47 - think ever actually went through
53:49 - completely with what I was trying to do
53:52 - all right let's see
54:11 - Grimm says isn't center X s /sm MMD
54:17 - large going to work on react alright
54:28 - let's see
54:42 - - this button okay
54:51 - all right maybe this will work fishin
54:56 - flex a line-item Center let's try this
55:01 - justify Content Center awesome
55:06 - okay so if we justify content Center and
55:09 - then we take this and we could probably
55:20 - justify content left didn't take us out
55:26 - far enough you also need to make
55:38 - display flex what is this
55:55 - that we're still off we're slightly off
56:22 - hmm all right let me have some
56:26 - suggestions here in the live chat so
56:28 - Nikki saying instead of justify content
56:30 - use justify item on the thing itself
56:32 - that's what I was looking for just try
56:34 - item okay button
56:40 - justify item
57:08 - Grimm says I love this channel awesome
57:12 - I'm glad to hear it
57:18 - we had a question if I'm using bootstrap
57:19 - reflects Bach flexbox Center works as
57:24 - Center on the logo
57:45 - John says you need to make 100% width or
57:49 - stretch the content yeah now we need
58:22 - Oh
58:42 - all right this is where okay
58:47 - so I don't need that justify items
59:02 - that's what I thought it's not doing
59:05 - anything anymore
59:06 - okay all right Nikki says okay I think I
59:12 - got I got it I think all right awesome
59:16 - let's see what's what's happening here
59:30 - uh-huh yes my boss just sent me an image
59:33 - to use instead of that cute little puppy
59:40 - cool it's a cool image all right awesome
59:44 - so after we fix this I'm gonna put that
59:47 - image in alright do you justify items
59:50 - flex start on the hamburger container
59:52 - okay uh neighbor container
60:16 - and then on the locator this fan okay so
60:22 - on this one will do justify items center
60:35 - all right dad
60:42 - that didn't do anything for me but it's
60:45 - possible that I've changed too much
60:48 - other stuff let me give it a refresh to
60:51 - clear out anything else that I've done
60:52 - oh wait sorry justify self okay I'm glad
60:56 - that I caught that before I refreshed it
61:00 - alright so just for self on
61:16 - Center
61:27 - all right still not all right I am gonna
61:34 - refresh cuz I think I've changed too
61:36 - much stuff and I can't remember what I
61:37 - changed which is the danger of dev tools
61:40 - for me it's actually it's good practice
61:45 - for me to frequently put in what I've
61:48 - done in dev tools into the actual code
61:51 - and let's try this again
62:07 - sorry Phoenix
62:10 - Abhishek the bot got you I think for all
62:15 - those emoji so don't worry about it just
62:18 - I guess I guess the butt doesn't like
62:24 - when you put that many emoji in alright
62:33 - it's alright so Nikki let me try to put
62:36 - in what you said before so on the
62:39 - container which I'm assuming is the the
62:43 - button then maybe I'm putting this in
62:50 - the wrong in the wrong part but let's do
62:52 - justify items like start and then on
63:09 - this band justify self Center alright
63:20 - yes so this is not working for me it's
63:22 - possible that I'm putting it in the
63:24 - wrong place though so is it supposed to
63:27 - be both of them self oops
63:46 - all right so on the button now I have
63:48 - justified self flex start and then I
63:51 - also on this pan I have justify self
63:54 - Center and column one needs to be
63:57 - display flex
64:08 - all right so it looks like yeah we have
64:11 - well if you mean this div on iki said it
64:17 - doesn't work sorry for wasting time
64:19 - don't worry about it it's not a waste of
64:21 - time to try out different things alright
64:25 - cool so let's keep trying I apologize if
64:31 - this is getting boring or something but
64:33 - I mean this is there's probably there's
64:36 - using this just to see how how
64:42 - frustrating it can be sometimes to try
64:44 - to get something seemingly so simple to
64:48 - work alright I'm gonna give it one more
64:53 - shot with these different flex
64:54 - properties before we go to actually
64:57 - adjusting the markup
65:04 - all right so jelly has a solution that
65:06 - says it worked
65:07 - so let's if you try my solution on the
65:12 - logos parents pan position:absolute left
65:15 - 50% transform Saturday okay so the logos
65:21 - parent
65:27 - so let's here let me refresh to get rid
65:29 - of everything we just did all right so
65:31 - here's our logos parent and that's this
65:34 - this I'm assuming what you mean the span
65:37 - and not this 8x I'm gonna go with the
65:39 - span and let's go with position:absolute
65:47 - and left 50% and then transform
66:03 - translate or translate negative 50% oh
66:14 - it works nice alright let's check it out
66:24 - here let's check out what it's done to
66:26 - us on the larger view yeah so it's done
66:32 - this so we're definitely gonna have to
66:33 - put that into a media query but so we'll
66:39 - figure out at what point we're dropping
66:43 - this stuff so whatever point we're
66:47 - dropping that stuff maybe we could do it
66:49 - or even yeah maybe somewhere around
66:52 - there so I'm guessing that's maybe like
66:55 - the small media query all right cool
67:00 - I like that it almost like it seems a
67:07 - little weird you know that we're doing
67:08 - this to Center it but my viewpoint is
67:12 - this if it works then it's okay as long
67:17 - as it's not causing some weird like
67:19 - performance thing that's that's messed
67:21 - up then I'm fine with that
67:22 - if later on we find a solution that
67:25 - seems like it's a little cleaner great
67:28 - but right now I really like that it
67:31 - works so let's go with that so let me go
67:37 - over here and we'll find that space
67:39 - which I believe that this is our class's
67:43 - flex so let me all right good so we're
67:52 - only using that once so I just want to
67:55 - make sure you aren't gonna mess anything
67:56 - else up so on our classes flex that's
67:58 - where we're gonna put this this media
68:00 - query and what did we do the other one
68:04 - we use the media query somewhere else
68:05 - already did we do it in the app bar a
68:11 - bar menu item maybe we did it here no
68:16 - that wasn't it
68:20 - we didn't do it here did we
68:32 - maybe we used it down here because we
68:35 - are hiding some things down here okay
68:43 - that hidden small and down that's it
68:47 - okay so we use that but there is another
68:49 - place where we use the media query let's
68:56 - see okay you know what there's some
69:03 - sandy keys asking how exactly that works
69:06 - that it would probably a good idea to
69:09 - describe what's going on here so alright
69:15 - so we have this position:absolute so
69:18 - it's it's taking it out of the flow of
69:22 - you know this is a span that's coming
69:25 - after this element right so we're having
69:28 - trouble centering things like that
69:29 - because it was always trying to center
69:32 - within this area which always would be
69:36 - off this is not taking into account the
69:37 - whole area so when we do
69:39 - position:absolute that takes it out of
69:41 - the normal flow so now we're you know
69:44 - the whole area is is being you know
69:47 - considered here so within and once we do
69:55 - that we can do this left 50% so let me
69:59 - let me take off transform we've got one
70:00 - at a time alright so position:absolute
70:03 - gets us now out of the flow then we go
70:07 - left 50% which actually doesn't look too
70:12 - bad let's shrink it down so it can we
70:16 - can see more so that means we're going
70:22 - 50% to the left but it's from this point
70:26 - so this point is 50% over but that's not
70:30 - taking to account the width of this
70:32 - element right because we want the center
70:34 - of this element to be 50% over that's
70:37 - why we do transform translate 50% that
70:41 - pushes the element over this way so
70:46 - negative 50% right that pushes it over
70:51 - half the width of this element which
70:55 - then makes the center the very center of
70:59 - this element if we can imagine a line
71:01 - going right in the center of this logo
71:04 - that centerline would line up exactly
71:07 - with the center line of this whole app
71:10 - bar right so if the site itself had a
71:14 - center line now the logo center line
71:16 - matches up so that's why we did that
71:18 - translate negative 50 so
71:22 - jillee correct me if I'm wrong on any of
71:25 - that but that's that's basically how
71:27 - this works so I really like I mean I
71:30 - know everybody's using flexbox and grid
71:32 - now but this solution is is really nice
71:35 - I think like it makes sense I've
71:39 - definitely used some stuff like that
71:42 - before you know compared to a lot of
71:47 - which you can do now with grid and
71:48 - flexbox it seems like we shouldn't have
71:52 - to go through all that but like the
71:54 - logic is you know it does make sense and
71:57 - and it definitely works so thanks again
72:00 - Joey all right so where was okay we need
72:05 - to actually do this but only for small
72:07 - screens so I need to see let me check in
72:12 - material UI documentation since I can't
72:15 - find it in our code we need let's go to
72:18 - CSS and J s and let's use there we are
72:23 - theme breakpoints great let's pull this
72:26 - out and we'll do let's go to that flex
72:36 - element and we're gonna add in a theme
72:38 - break point and let's try small I'm
72:42 - assuming small as SM seems reasonable
72:46 - and let's go now to display wow it's
72:51 - given me
72:53 - display absolute and then we're gonna go
73:00 - left 50% and transform translate and
73:16 - it's going to be negative 50%
73:23 - alright let's save that see what we have
73:34 - mm all right not exactly working out you
73:41 - know because we still had that in dev
73:42 - tools let's refresh in Syria
73:51 - okay not working I messed up something
73:53 - display what did I mess up
74:13 - what did I mess up
74:17 - make points down
74:24 - did I set that opposite no it's work
74:28 - working uh maybe this is something wrong
74:37 - display no I put display instead of
74:43 - position right position there we are
74:48 - Oh John I see you you had that too and
74:51 - Michael so hey Joey
74:53 - haha everybody got that good job alright
74:57 - so let's see where that breakpoint is
75:00 - gonna hit great that's perfect we it's
75:07 - not so flike fast so you're gonna have
75:10 - some like a second where it it goes over
75:14 - I'm not worried about that I mean if
75:16 - anybody is doing this stuff like I am
75:18 - then they're probably a developer so
75:20 - they will understand awesome oh that's
75:27 - so cool it works very cool a hover
75:33 - height
75:40 - Joey tags in caps and got banned for
75:45 - five seconds from the from the but it's
75:48 - fun that we have a bot in here now
75:50 - all right so my timer just went up and
75:53 - that's awesome just in time to get that
75:56 - centered I'm gonna be honest I really
75:59 - expected that we would get more done
76:01 - today than just this Oh woah it happens
76:08 - all right so let me look in the latch at
76:14 - answer some questions and we'll see what
76:16 - time it is after that maybe I'll put in
76:20 - the new image maybe not we'll see see
76:25 - how it goes all right where did I leave
76:29 - off okay
77:05 - maybe there's not a lot of question I'm
77:07 - not finding a lot of questions here so
77:09 - it might not be be too much more to talk
77:15 - about in this train
77:29 - all right here's a question so Pruthvi p
77:35 - or you d hv i not sure to pronounce that
77:39 - please correct me if i was wrong but
77:41 - anyway the question is why is reacts so
77:46 - useful i know what reuses components
77:49 - like recyclerview and java i mean we can
77:53 - simply copy and paste component code
77:55 - again yeah you're right we can copy and
77:59 - paste again but I think like in a bigger
78:03 - like in a bigger app you don't want to
78:06 - be copy and pasting a lot of stuff right
78:08 - it saves you a lot of time and then you
78:12 - know when you have everything split out
78:13 - into components it's really nice to be
78:15 - able to reuse them and it's not just
78:18 - about copy and pasting I mean you can do
78:19 - things like this where you know when we
78:23 - do this list this is the list card
78:25 - component we pass in an array right and
78:28 - we map over the array items and we could
78:31 - have you know 500 you know items and all
78:35 - being being rendered and we only did
78:40 - this one time so right now I have this
78:44 - list data component so all the data
78:47 - lives here you know in a JavaScript
78:50 - array but we could this is just some
78:52 - kind of test data for the presentation
78:55 - tomorrow but we could be pulling this
78:58 - from a database somewhere and send it
79:02 - right in here and now from one component
79:05 - we could have just rendered you know as
79:08 - I said before 500 or whatever however
79:10 - many you want so I think that's that
79:15 - that makes it more clear about the
79:16 - benefit of using components so maybe I'm
79:19 - misunderstanding the question but
79:20 - hopefully that makes it a bit more clear
79:22 - you know you definitely wouldn't want to
79:24 - actually put all of this data in and
79:28 - then copy and paste this 500 times right
79:31 - that would be it would be a lot of code
79:34 - and it would take a long time and then
79:39 - if somebody you needed to come in here
79:40 - and make an edit
79:41 - you know that'd be kind of a mess anyway
79:46 - so that's as I see it that's one of the
79:49 - benefits of using react and it's not
79:51 - like other systems don't do this in
79:53 - their own way it's not unique to react
79:56 - but it's definitely ate a benefit
80:11 - let's see the Johnny plays asks what
80:15 - programming language is this
80:17 - this is JavaScript in particular though
80:20 - we're using react which is a JavaScript
80:22 - library that it looks like a mix of HTML
80:26 - and JavaScript it's not really this is
80:30 - like some syntactic sugar
80:33 - really it's JSX right I believe it's
80:37 - called JSX when you
80:38 - it looks like the HTML tags when reality
80:41 - all this is or you know this is
80:43 - JavaScript functions so each time you
80:47 - see a tag like this really what's
80:49 - happening is it's creating a new element
80:52 - like you could do normally in JavaScript
81:10 - San Bay says I like your radio do you
81:15 - mean the the free coke amp radio that's
81:17 - going on 24/7 now yeah it's pretty cool
81:21 - if you all haven't checked it out yet I
81:22 - mean I'm sure you've seen it on the
81:24 - channel now we have this this radio
81:26 - station and all the songs are created by
81:30 - free code camp members I don't release
81:34 - it members like it's not like we pay a
81:37 - membership fee or anything but created
81:39 - by by people who are in you know free
81:42 - code camp so it's pretty cool check it
81:45 - out and then there's a live chat going
81:47 - on every time I've been in there there's
81:49 - been at least like 20 people so it's
81:52 - pretty cool like Quincy was in there for
81:55 - a while talking so you never know who's
81:57 - gonna pop in and talk so it's kind of
82:00 - cool just to listen to while you're
82:01 - doing other things throughout the day
82:09 - Emerson says it's cool to know I'm not
82:11 - alone when working with CSS yeah I mean
82:14 - I personally like CSS but it can
82:18 - definitely be tricky sometimes
82:31 - almost to the end here
82:40 - Gander 7 says I hate data import from
82:43 - system with no validation were you
82:48 - talking about the data I was just saying
82:50 - when I was talking about bringing data
82:52 - in yeah I mean right now I'm not worried
82:56 - about it because this is just test stuff
82:58 - but in general you would want to have
83:01 - some validation I'm a little bit more
83:04 - lenient with that when I have control
83:07 - over all the data where it's coming from
83:10 - so it's way less likely that we're gonna
83:13 - get we use the OK gander 7 says notice
83:16 - what I'm working on
83:17 - ok cool cool all right
83:22 - for some reason Google and my phone
83:24 - keeps thinking that I'm talking to it
83:27 - keeps like popping up saying it doesn't
83:30 - recognize my voice it's just weird
83:33 - but anyway all right I've gotten to the
83:36 - end of the live chat I think I'm gonna
83:37 - take a break now because I feel like I
83:40 - need a break and so I'm not gonna put in
83:42 - the the new image so maybe that'll be a
83:44 - surprise for tomorrow that will unveil
83:47 - the the new header image that are the
83:51 - hero image so I have to say goodbye to
83:54 - the cute puppy and and we'll have an
83:58 - actual image of campus let's see oh ok
84:07 - Jeff Miller says I know you're working
84:09 - on the mobile look now but on a desktop
84:11 - the navbar text is compacted together
84:13 - all right let's take a look at that you
84:21 - know what Jeff I'm not seeing it here
84:22 - could you let me know
84:23 - what browser and device you're looking
84:26 - at that with and also the like the
84:30 - browser version if you could so you can
84:34 - just put it here in the in the chat even
84:36 - if it's after the stream ends they'll
84:38 - still be like a minute or two where you
84:39 - can put it in the chat so maybe it's
84:44 - maybe I'm we're using something that
84:46 - doesn't work in all browsers Nietzsche
84:52 - says put the puppy somewhere as an
84:53 - easter egg
84:54 - he's like a mascot by now I was just
84:56 - thinking that as I was saying we're
84:59 - gonna get rid of it I'm thinking like is
85:00 - there a way to put images in the console
85:03 - so that if somebody opens dev tools will
85:06 - see it if there is I think I should
85:09 - definitely do it all right
85:12 - Jeff's astride an edge and Firefox okay
85:16 - I'll have to test it we're definitely
85:19 - gonna have to do some thorough testing
85:20 - before this goes live I'm okay with not
85:25 - testing it that much before the
85:26 - presentation because I'm gonna be
85:28 - displaying it from you know from my
85:31 - computer and so it should be alright
85:35 - I can control the environment but yeah
85:40 - maybe we'll definitely have to figure
85:42 - out what's going on there
85:43 - all right thanks Jeff for pointing that
85:46 - out and for testing it out and you know
85:48 - various ways all right but anyway I
85:53 - think we had a good stream it took
85:57 - longer to do a little thing that I
85:58 - thought it would but we worked through
86:00 - it and that's always I mean that's a win
86:04 - right even if it took longer that's a
86:06 - win we got it to work it looks awesome
86:08 - and you all helped a lot and 2008 yeah
86:12 - happy Valentine's Day for everybody out
86:15 - there also a happy beginning of Lent its
86:19 - Ash Wednesday so for anybody that I
86:24 - guess it's Catholic or even their non
86:27 - Catholics I think that celebrate Lent I
86:30 - think anyway
86:32 - so in our day that we have both
86:35 - happening on the same day but anyway
86:38 - whatever you're celebrating today I hope
86:41 - you have a great day and I'll see you
86:44 - all back tomorrow hopefully hopefully my
86:46 - meetings gonna don't go too long but I
86:49 - should be back maybe around the same
86:50 - time maybe out 1 p.m. Eastern time
86:53 - tomorrow so I'll see you then

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and today we're gonna do some design and dev work on a home page for our react site and we're using material design and we have a framework called material UI that we're using to build things out so we're gonna be working with that and all the codes available there's a link in the description and I thought I'd start out today by giving a very brief overview of the project since we haven't done an overview for a while or on this is the thirtyfifth stream I believe so we're pretty far into this project and I know some of you are kind of jumping in in the middle so let me give just a really quick breakdown and that'll give everybody a chance to join in as well if they're just getting their notifications that we've gone live so we have a react site that we build with next j/s primarily we went with next j/s because it offers very easy serverside rendering we have all our content housed in a wordpress installation so that means it's a my sequel database on WordPress we have the WP graph QL plugin and that allows us to pull data from that my sequel database with graph QL and bring it into our react application so whenever we grab data we're almost exclusively using graph QL the reason we went with WordPress is because it's very easy for people who don't really know a lot about code to input content so that's why we went with that it's also very stable and has a large user base so we made a custom plugin to of us a lot of different post types and taxonomies if you're not familiar with WordPress you know terminology and things it's just you know different ways for us to house our data and to make it very simple for people who are managing content to know where to put the data and that's that's it I mean that that's pretty much the overview of where we're at we've had some other steps along the way we've had to migrate some data but overall that's the structure of of the project so far so right now I'm at the point in the project where I need to make it look nice enough to present it to some people here at the university that I work for so I'd like to have that presentable looking by tomorrow morning and then I'll have a meeting my first of several meetings where I get to display this so that's where we're at right now if anyone has any questions about how we set anything up let me know I could at least point you to the stream where we set that up so you can watch the setup process yourself or I can you know take a few minutes and explain it let's see just want to say hi and read through a little bit in the live chat now before we start to see if there's anything I should address now okay great so Niki has some advice for my presentations about is just to talk about its value to the visitors not only its features alright that's that's really good advice if anyone has any advice for me when I go to present the site please let me know I'm gonna be talking to different groups so one group is going to be people that are like in charge of the university and another group is gonna be people who are primarily they interact with the students they're in charge of the student life Department I think I might do I don't think I'm gonna meet with faculty members I think I'm gonna do like a live stream for faculty members we're gonna call it a webinar because that's more like with their terminology that they're used to so that's depending on the group I may focus a little bit more on different features I even thought about kind of changing some of the content we have on the homepage for different groups but I don't want to get too far ahead of myself we still have some work to do right now so let me switch over so that you all can see what I'm saying on on one of my screens here so here's the code let me just catch you up on what I've done I've created this list card component which we we did a lot of the styling for that yesterday but I've split it out into a component yeah this is too small make it a little bigger okay and let me try to get as much out of the way as we can so here's the new component and all the code is up to date in in github so if you click the link below you'll be able to see it and you can also see the website if I start this and Rock server you'll be able to check out the website on your own computer there it is so if you can view the live chat there's a link now in the live chat to check out this site unfortunately if you're watching later on this and Rock server probably won't be running so you won't have access to it otherwise I would put the link in the description as well and I can for those of you who can't see the site right now I'm gonna pull this over and I we're primarily doing the mobile view of the site right now so I've been kind of showing it at this view and this is a very small phone so the odds of somebody having a phone like this are low but I really want to make sure it looks all right on all different devices so you may notice some differences I'll try to point them out as I go through so we still have the the cute little dog as our background picture which we need to get rid of that I keep putting it off because I'm hoping that someone else in my department will send me a picture that they really think would work it hasn't happened yet but I'd rather not spend a lot of time going through pictures because they I can spend a lot of time on that so one thing that I did do is I changed the way we're bringing in YouTube embeds so before material.you I already has a media card component where you could put in the URL that you want to use and what component you want to use in our case we were passing in as a prop iframe and we were also passing in the source so that was okay but the problem was it was acting like we were hovering the entire time so if you see it's not letting me do it here for some reason when I inspect this with dev tools it doesn't have the same hover effect but anyway when you hover the YouTube button is entirely red whereas normally it's let me refresh can see this normally again so oh well now it's doing it for some reason I keep getting this always red button maybe it's because it's mobile sorry I think that's the issue yeah okay so on mobile we can't really do anything about it but when we have more of a desktop view we have this semitransparent button and then it only goes red when you hover so for some reason when we use the material UI component like it was always red I couldn't get it to change so now I just have a card where I directly put an iframe in it works and it doesn't really add anything to the code so I think it's fine but you may see a difference in the code I would switch it back here I've changed out so a lot of the silly filler content that I had in there I'm gonna have to take out so I'm starting to put in like real facts we built this card out before so here's what I came up with for that list component now I know this all probably looks really small on your screen so I encourage you to use that anger out link if you can but anyway so we have the events list here we have some data and we have some options so if you don't pass in an image then it goes full width like this which I think works better when you have more content also you don't have to pass in the secondary text if you don't want to so you just have you should kind of show on a few of the options that we have here I'm still thinking that I'd like to display the date of these events somewhere but I also think it's time for me to move on and get this page looking like it's completed and then if I have time I can go back and add in some details so the rest I do still have some of those that filler content in here so today what I'd like to do is go and maybe make some real content for some of these pieces and also work on see some of the details so as we go through I'll point out some of the details that I still don't like about how this looks and and we'll fix those all right okay so that's what we started I'm going to start with Pomodoro clock so I may reset this so I'd like to break up the work in Pomodoro sessions so we're going to do 25 minutes of code and then I'll take a fiveminute break I'll go back to the live chat oh I got to say this out loud though Ruben says how is it possible to be so handsome I I'm gonna assume that that was directed towards me and that I am the one that is so handsome so I don't know I you could thank the person that cuts my hair also my mom and dad they probably had something to do with the handsomeness I'm just I'm just messing around I'm sure that was probably a joke but it still feels good to get comments like that so thank you okay so let's get into some of the code first off let's put in a little bit more content and I'm gonna run some ideas by you about you know kind of what I'm thinking we have right now especially in this view it's just a lot of content you know like right in a row it kind of works but I'm I don't know if my boss will like this idea or not but I'm thinking about maybe we can split up the content into some sections I'm I don't know I'm on the fence about that one and I'm not sure that's something I can get done before a presentation but it seems to me like sections might help break things up a little bit and make more sense of this content so as we're going through if you see some I don't know some pattern to things where you think a section of it might be good let me know I know that's pretty vague I just had the idea you know an hour or two ago so I'm still kind of thinking about it as well but all right one detail that I really like to change that keeps bothering me so let's just change it right now is I really want this logo to be centered I don't know that bothers anybody else but on a larger screen I think it looks fine to be over here but when it's this small it it's close enough to the center that it looks weird let me know if you disagree with that but I just think it it looks like it's supposed to be centered but it's offcenter to me only when it's this small though so first thing I'm going to do is just inspect this in dev tools which if you are viewing this through that and Rock link you should be able to do this as well and so let's see what the container is this will help to figure out mmhmm all right I don't like that so the container that's large enough to actually you make this go to the middle is this container here this div but the div also contains this button I don't want the button to be centered so let's see what we can do alright let's check out how this really is in the component right because material UI is changing these into some dips but let's see what the the component actually looks like so this is probably going to be in our app bar let's see the app over here Wow the app bar is quite a large component I haven't done anything with the app bar in a while so here's our logo and let's see is this the making sure we should have two places with a logo one of them is going to be the drawer so but I think we have that in a separate component interesting that's really interesting how we did that hmm I can i I'm looking at this I you you all can probably see already but I'm kind of puzzled looking at this that I did it this way so I probably copied over an example from the material UI documentation which had typography as an element in the app bar and it was probably just some text and then what I did instead of replacing typography with another element I just added this image element inside of the typography element I don't know that that's this may be a waste of of this element here so I'm gonna try to do a little bit let's let's say refactoring here and maybe clean this up and see what happens so what I'd like to do is let's see what with this classes flex is going right now to see if we should keep it or we can get rid of it so let's find flex okay so it's just saying flex one for that all right let's and then you button this is classes two column one class I wonder if we should have two different structures one for small screen and one for a large screen I see some more of you saying hi in the live chat hey thanks for watching thanks for joining in okay so here was my thought if I go changing this it's not only going to change for the mobile view it's going to change for the desktop view I don't want the desktop view to change so I need to not just start deleting things ideally what I would be able to do is just take one of these classes like let's take a look at the header image class for an example and use a media query or the the mature UI version of a media query which I'll show you an example in just a second and just change the style like that so I I think that'll be the best way to go for now even though I really don't like that to typography element maybe now when is this close to the presentation isn't the time for me to be going in and just trying things and hoping they don't break and I can't find that header image there we are okay that's it huh and they see where where that was that okay so that actually is on the image that's iPod Rafi alright let's go back to dev tools play around just a little bit I I kind of think we're gonna have to change the structure of this if it was just structured slightly different this wouldn't be as big of a deal all right so with so this is the yeah all right let's try this with so okay so the problem was these containers weren't yeah this isn't going to work with this structure so we can we can set the alignment to be centered but you see the the container here is is already offcenter so we're not gonna get it to be centered exactly with the element like that if we took it out of the flow though and it's just sticky no the snap isn't sticky and maybe it should be all right I have an idea here's my idea and I'm gonna say before I do it so that you all can stop me if it's a silly idea alright so number one I think it makes sense for this knife to be sticky on mobile because there's a lot of scrolling going on here it would be nice to be able to just get to the menu without having to scroll back up I I would appreciate that so I think at the very least on mobile that we should have a sticky navigation or fixed navigation whatever you prefer maybe even on desktop that might be the way to go but at least on mobile we should do that secondly if we're going to do a fixed navigation we could just position this thing differently so that all right like potentially we might be able to just take it out of the flow right now so we'll see how this works but let's alright good so I'm getting some feedback so Nikki says make it thinner while scrolling it's a personal preference I dislike all the space that it consumes okay yeah I I agree with that I agree so first things first let's make it sticky and then we can try to shrink it a little bit I I definitely think we can shrink it it's there's a lot of white space happening this logo could be smaller and still be perfectly readable so let's do that a new Java version I would remind me later I don't even know why I have job on here I I'm not sure if I actually use anything that needs it I suspect the material I probably already has a class that will make this fixed so let's just see if we can add that class before I try to do it on my own or is I know I have the material ID documentation already open air we are in at least one place I probably have it open multiple places do you ever get to that point on your desktop that it's faster just to search just to open a new tab and go to a website than to try to find what website what tab like you already have open with that website in there I said that really awkwardly hopefully made sense but that's where I'm at right now is that I know I have certain websites open but I just don't know where so I end up just opening up opening them up again let's check out the app bar and let's see fixed awesome so we can do position what's the difference between sticky note sticky is not universally supported and we'll fullback the static little bit different options just going to be all right yeah I want to see what the options are okay so stickies experimental all right I remember seeing this before so stickies for everything you know interesting and it falls back to static otherwise let's see what sticky is supported by so position sticky so edge supports it Firefox partially supports it okay not supported on table supported on thn us safari supports it all right let's use to this and sticky because we have pretty good support yeah I like the support on this all right cool if you've never been to can I use calm before it's very very useful supereasy one thing I really like is as soon as you go there your cursors automatically put right here so you soon as it loads you can just start typing and you don't even you know it just searches as you as you go so really simple and fast and you would just immediately know whether or not you know a specific thing in CSS or JavaScript or HTML will work also if you're not using mdn so Mozilla developer Network you should definitely check it out usually as way more information than I need but the examples are super useful so those are if you only take away two things from this stream those two things will be more helpful to you probably than anything else that I do okay and I know I'm not keeping up with the live chat right now in about ten minutes or so I'm gonna check back in the live chat and see what what I've been missing and respond to any questions all right so let's add that in this app bar it's a position yeah it was position so instead of static we're gonna type in sticky give that a save and see what happens alright nothing so far maybe I need to put in some more information what happened to that did I seriously close material UI mister now you can see all my browsing history right temp is from I did I not close it Wow ok I don't know what I did with it easy to get back to the app let's look at the API sticky all right maybe we will go to the demos because it doesn't explain what else I'm it seems to me like there needs to be some other indicator of like when is it supposed to go sticky simply button mmm alright it looks like none of these are sticky yeah these are all position static let me check you're looking for position fig stickies useful phone and bars that are down a bit and stick to the top after you scroll oh that's what the sticky is then nevermind I feel silly now okay I was thinking that sticky would give us something at an option like the app bar would just yeah I don't know what I was thinking thanks sneaky all right let's go to a position fixed I was just excited to use something new I know okay we got to do unexpected but I should have expected it so our content now since the app bar is gone has gone to a fixed position all of our content has now gone up to the top of the page so we need you you think material you I would have already had something to take that into account let's see oh whoa let's check out the layout what's this portal uhhuh that's I haven't seen that component before all right let's let's take a bar and where's our main let's go back to our layout component and this is where we bring in the app bar and then we have everything else falls in this main component here so if we go up to classes main right now it's the only thing we have on there is this flex so what we want to do then is set a margin top yeah I guess margin to work and we want the margin top to be the same height as the a bar but I'd like them to always be I want them to always be the same let's check our app bar component I'm checking to see if we have a height set already I guess we don't it's kind of odd I would have expected that let's go back here and see okay we do have this is that root component which basically is is just a container component here see what we're getting our height from so from somewhere in here then okay so some of our height at least is is set here by this icon to 48 pixels are that makes sense let's see where we can put height at if I'm confusing you right now then hold on just it's going to make a lot of sense once I actually do it assuming that it works and I think it'll be easier to see it then for me to explain it that's interesting okay that's pretty cool and interesting let's see header okay the way this is set up is not gonna make it easy to do to change the height all right let's see you're searching for a component that when I add a height it would actually make make a change all right maybe this is not gonna work out like the way I wanted to work out all right so basically we can have it be fixed and have everything work if we just put a height of 65 on our root component right and what do we do on layout whatever I did on layout I need to change okay all right my timer went off so it's time for me to go to the live chat but we can see we now have our fixed app bar and yeah that definitely needs to be smaller but in any case we have it fixed now okay we've gotten deeper and deeper into this whole of like all I wanted to do is make this centered and it's now become so much more complicated all right let me set a fiveminute timer then and I'm gonna scroll up to the top of the live chat go down I'm gonna try to get to as many comments and questions as I can see Gander 7 says have you seen visual studio live sharing you can code collaboratively between visual studio code and visual studio even even sharing a session code visual studio comm alright as the rest of the URL there okay cool I'll have to check that up I have not used it yet John says I got p.m. today a painting question I answered honestly then I was destroyed with a horrible lashing out so Jessie it's nice to come here where people are civilized oh I'm really sorry that happened to you but yeah I'm never gonna lash out at anyone in Chad even if you said something that made me really mad I would I would still try my best to just be chill about it and I probably just blocked you if I thought that it was harming the the experience in the live chat but anyway I've been trying to be really chill about everything lately not in a live chat in particular obviously in the live chat but just in general especially with my kids because they're all little and so been trying to just be really calm and keep it like a nice tone of voice with you know even if I'm mad so anyway this is definitely a nice calm place to be in so if you're joining us for the first time you might not know that but feel free to ask any questions even no matter how basic you know you think they are nobody's going to get mad at you for it or be mean about it and if they are then if they're really really mean and they won't stop I block them if they're mean though I usually say something you know kind of politely you know tell people to be nice let's see Grimlock er says can I ask which is better for me to study bootstrap or angular I'm still new okay well it looks like you did get some answers already and the answers are pretty good so Joey says bootstrap and angular 2 different types of tools and yeah that's that's a hundred percent correct so bootstrap is for user interface so like design it's basically like a prebuilt design framework that you can use you know they're their components angular is that's hard to explain especially I guess if you're just starting out yeah but basically the the easy answer the quick answer is you can certainly study both at the same time because they do two different things you can use bootstrap with angular you could use it on its own and the same thing you can use angular on its own they do different things so if you'd like to learn them both go ahead if you want to they're learn one or the other that's fine but you you don't use them for the same thing if you want me to go more indepth into the differences please let me know I can do that but I don't want to spend too much time going to the question if if no one's interested in it ah no says I agree with the fixed navigation or a button you can click and it will send you the top that's another good option that's a good option as well if a wonderful interior you I have something like that builtin I know I've done that on other sites I'm not sure I've done it with the react site yet but so I have some code that's probably jQuery that we could maybe adapt to do that or hopefully material I have something like that left to see let me know what y'all think is it better to just have a button that sends you to the top like a very small you know button that would maybe pop up after you scroll so far you know just just maybe in the bottom righthand corner it would pop up or is it better to have that fixed navbar that follows you all the way down let's see John Henson says where make just the hamburger fixed okay just the hamburger icon that's interesting I wonder how that would look Stewart says just close the tabs okay a noble and Savage is all right so if you all remember whenever I was talking about how I had all my tabs open and it's easier just to search for something like in my browser then they have to find the tab that's open a noble site and savage says inspects memory footprint of browser your browsers using 5.3 gigabytes of RAM you laugh at that but if I saw that I wouldn't be surprised at all I think my browser is always the using the most RAM out of anything all right I'm gonna check I only have a few more comments here in the live chat so let me check out a few of these comments before we go back to the code Michael D or G I'm not sure I pronounce the last name there if you let me know I'll try to pronounce it correctly but anyway the question is I just started using material UI version 1 I notice the button element doesn't have an onclick attribute so how do you trigger on click events with a with buttons for Redux actions etc how do i sorry I'm always yawning on these streams I really sorry you know what I'm not I'm not really sure how I handle buttons it's usually they got it you got to be able to use one click with a button right we had to have done this before with something let me think about that we may actually come across a button in the stream today if anybody remembers how we've handled buttons in previous projects please put it in the live chat because I know we've done stuff like that before and we have use on click things so I just can't remember right now if we had any issues with that uhuh Ruben says the handsome comment wasn't a joke you've got a good phenotype I envy that beard alright cool well thank you I appreciate it and yeah well I just I got my beard trimmed yesterday and I got a haircut so it probably looks okay right now normally it I let it go and it gets rid of bushy and wild but right now it's like looks slightly less wild but I said I appreciate the comment though alright so we do have some some other opinions on this navbar so hmm it was the sticky never would look a little nicer small button fading as usuals down alright so maybe we don't go with the fixed navbar I'm getting getting some some opinions against the the fixed navbar here I wanted to see how this looks oh okay so the fix and a bar also messed up some stuff for us here so that was unexpected all right let's go back here and resort layout I don't know where yet yeah this is what we did it let's go back to static save that and verify that this now works no what the heck oh you know we changed some other stuff so that's probably why it's not it's not gonna work all right what else do we change oh yeah so we're getting some there's some more opinions about fixed nav bars being annoying if they're too thick yeah so we could make it thinner or I'm I don't know I'm thinking now maybe we could just avoid having to like deal with this like cascade of issues that we're seeing here if we just go with that button that scroll to top button this also seems like something that could wait until after the presentation so it's probably something that doesn't need to be done right now so I'll just keep in mind to try to find a component that that'll give us that scroll to top or some other solution but I think I've got myself into like too much stuff considering I have a presentation tomorrow I think it's at 1100 a.m. tomorrow what the heck is this healing from why are we importing healing that that stuff my mistake when did that change alright let me just go back hidden there we go I accidentally changed that so alright good okay this is back to normal alright so we're back to normal here we are whoops switch it to here we're right back where we started and that is how do we make this centered all right let me take a drink and let's start over for all of you that are new to the stream one of the biggest features of this stream that makes it stand out from other streams is that I don't rehearse anything so mistakes can and do happen often and this is my everyday work so we worked through the mistakes together I just realized that I also forgot to start my timer again so let's start the timer all right now let's go back to this all right so our mission is get this logo centered on small screens what we're not gonna do is change the we're not we're doing to try to change as little as possible in this app bar okay ha ha Ruben says I heard centering things is half the job of a frontend dev it certainly seems like that today doesn't it all right so let's go back to our app bar component where we actually have this and let's see what we can do let's see if let's see if we can add a set of media queries to the classes that we're already using that that change some of the values that may work so here's what we're gonna do the image itself that's interesting it looks like the link is only on the bottom half of this let's see if that's correct hmm let's let's open this up so I can actually see all right yeah let's go to a new page oh no that did work cool all right I'm not worried about that anymore as I was scrolling through here it looked like the link tag would not work but it did all right so let's start here and let's see we probably already did this I don't think ever actually went through completely with what I was trying to do all right let's see Grimm says isn't center X s /sm MMD large going to work on react alright let's see this button okay all right maybe this will work fishin flex a lineitem Center let's try this justify Content Center awesome okay so if we justify content Center and then we take this and we could probably justify content left didn't take us out far enough you also need to make display flex what is this that we're still off we're slightly off hmm all right let me have some suggestions here in the live chat so Nikki saying instead of justify content use justify item on the thing itself that's what I was looking for just try item okay button justify item Grimm says I love this channel awesome I'm glad to hear it we had a question if I'm using bootstrap reflects Bach flexbox Center works as Center on the logo John says you need to make 100% width or stretch the content yeah now we need Oh all right this is where okay so I don't need that justify items that's what I thought it's not doing anything anymore okay all right Nikki says okay I think I got I got it I think all right awesome let's see what's what's happening here uhhuh yes my boss just sent me an image to use instead of that cute little puppy cool it's a cool image all right awesome so after we fix this I'm gonna put that image in alright do you justify items flex start on the hamburger container okay uh neighbor container and then on the locator this fan okay so on this one will do justify items center all right dad that didn't do anything for me but it's possible that I've changed too much other stuff let me give it a refresh to clear out anything else that I've done oh wait sorry justify self okay I'm glad that I caught that before I refreshed it alright so just for self on Center all right still not all right I am gonna refresh cuz I think I've changed too much stuff and I can't remember what I changed which is the danger of dev tools for me it's actually it's good practice for me to frequently put in what I've done in dev tools into the actual code and let's try this again sorry Phoenix Abhishek the bot got you I think for all those emoji so don't worry about it just I guess I guess the butt doesn't like when you put that many emoji in alright it's alright so Nikki let me try to put in what you said before so on the container which I'm assuming is the the button then maybe I'm putting this in the wrong in the wrong part but let's do justify items like start and then on this band justify self Center alright yes so this is not working for me it's possible that I'm putting it in the wrong place though so is it supposed to be both of them self oops all right so on the button now I have justified self flex start and then I also on this pan I have justify self Center and column one needs to be display flex all right so it looks like yeah we have well if you mean this div on iki said it doesn't work sorry for wasting time don't worry about it it's not a waste of time to try out different things alright cool so let's keep trying I apologize if this is getting boring or something but I mean this is there's probably there's using this just to see how how frustrating it can be sometimes to try to get something seemingly so simple to work alright I'm gonna give it one more shot with these different flex properties before we go to actually adjusting the markup all right so jelly has a solution that says it worked so let's if you try my solution on the logos parents pan positionabsolute left 50% transform Saturday okay so the logos parent so let's here let me refresh to get rid of everything we just did all right so here's our logos parent and that's this this I'm assuming what you mean the span and not this 8x I'm gonna go with the span and let's go with positionabsolute and left 50% and then transform translate or translate negative 50% oh it works nice alright let's check it out here let's check out what it's done to us on the larger view yeah so it's done this so we're definitely gonna have to put that into a media query but so we'll figure out at what point we're dropping this stuff so whatever point we're dropping that stuff maybe we could do it or even yeah maybe somewhere around there so I'm guessing that's maybe like the small media query all right cool I like that it almost like it seems a little weird you know that we're doing this to Center it but my viewpoint is this if it works then it's okay as long as it's not causing some weird like performance thing that's that's messed up then I'm fine with that if later on we find a solution that seems like it's a little cleaner great but right now I really like that it works so let's go with that so let me go over here and we'll find that space which I believe that this is our class's flex so let me all right good so we're only using that once so I just want to make sure you aren't gonna mess anything else up so on our classes flex that's where we're gonna put this this media query and what did we do the other one we use the media query somewhere else already did we do it in the app bar a bar menu item maybe we did it here no that wasn't it we didn't do it here did we maybe we used it down here because we are hiding some things down here okay that hidden small and down that's it okay so we use that but there is another place where we use the media query let's see okay you know what there's some sandy keys asking how exactly that works that it would probably a good idea to describe what's going on here so alright so we have this positionabsolute so it's it's taking it out of the flow of you know this is a span that's coming after this element right so we're having trouble centering things like that because it was always trying to center within this area which always would be off this is not taking into account the whole area so when we do positionabsolute that takes it out of the normal flow so now we're you know the whole area is is being you know considered here so within and once we do that we can do this left 50% so let me let me take off transform we've got one at a time alright so positionabsolute gets us now out of the flow then we go left 50% which actually doesn't look too bad let's shrink it down so it can we can see more so that means we're going 50% to the left but it's from this point so this point is 50% over but that's not taking to account the width of this element right because we want the center of this element to be 50% over that's why we do transform translate 50% that pushes the element over this way so negative 50% right that pushes it over half the width of this element which then makes the center the very center of this element if we can imagine a line going right in the center of this logo that centerline would line up exactly with the center line of this whole app bar right so if the site itself had a center line now the logo center line matches up so that's why we did that translate negative 50 so jillee correct me if I'm wrong on any of that but that's that's basically how this works so I really like I mean I know everybody's using flexbox and grid now but this solution is is really nice I think like it makes sense I've definitely used some stuff like that before you know compared to a lot of which you can do now with grid and flexbox it seems like we shouldn't have to go through all that but like the logic is you know it does make sense and and it definitely works so thanks again Joey all right so where was okay we need to actually do this but only for small screens so I need to see let me check in material UI documentation since I can't find it in our code we need let's go to CSS and J s and let's use there we are theme breakpoints great let's pull this out and we'll do let's go to that flex element and we're gonna add in a theme break point and let's try small I'm assuming small as SM seems reasonable and let's go now to display wow it's given me display absolute and then we're gonna go left 50% and transform translate and it's going to be negative 50% alright let's save that see what we have mm all right not exactly working out you know because we still had that in dev tools let's refresh in Syria okay not working I messed up something display what did I mess up what did I mess up make points down did I set that opposite no it's work working uh maybe this is something wrong display no I put display instead of position right position there we are Oh John I see you you had that too and Michael so hey Joey haha everybody got that good job alright so let's see where that breakpoint is gonna hit great that's perfect we it's not so flike fast so you're gonna have some like a second where it it goes over I'm not worried about that I mean if anybody is doing this stuff like I am then they're probably a developer so they will understand awesome oh that's so cool it works very cool a hover height Joey tags in caps and got banned for five seconds from the from the but it's fun that we have a bot in here now all right so my timer just went up and that's awesome just in time to get that centered I'm gonna be honest I really expected that we would get more done today than just this Oh woah it happens all right so let me look in the latch at answer some questions and we'll see what time it is after that maybe I'll put in the new image maybe not we'll see see how it goes all right where did I leave off okay maybe there's not a lot of question I'm not finding a lot of questions here so it might not be be too much more to talk about in this train all right here's a question so Pruthvi p or you d hv i not sure to pronounce that please correct me if i was wrong but anyway the question is why is reacts so useful i know what reuses components like recyclerview and java i mean we can simply copy and paste component code again yeah you're right we can copy and paste again but I think like in a bigger like in a bigger app you don't want to be copy and pasting a lot of stuff right it saves you a lot of time and then you know when you have everything split out into components it's really nice to be able to reuse them and it's not just about copy and pasting I mean you can do things like this where you know when we do this list this is the list card component we pass in an array right and we map over the array items and we could have you know 500 you know items and all being being rendered and we only did this one time so right now I have this list data component so all the data lives here you know in a JavaScript array but we could this is just some kind of test data for the presentation tomorrow but we could be pulling this from a database somewhere and send it right in here and now from one component we could have just rendered you know as I said before 500 or whatever however many you want so I think that's that that makes it more clear about the benefit of using components so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question but hopefully that makes it a bit more clear you know you definitely wouldn't want to actually put all of this data in and then copy and paste this 500 times right that would be it would be a lot of code and it would take a long time and then if somebody you needed to come in here and make an edit you know that'd be kind of a mess anyway so that's as I see it that's one of the benefits of using react and it's not like other systems don't do this in their own way it's not unique to react but it's definitely ate a benefit let's see the Johnny plays asks what programming language is this this is JavaScript in particular though we're using react which is a JavaScript library that it looks like a mix of HTML and JavaScript it's not really this is like some syntactic sugar really it's JSX right I believe it's called JSX when you it looks like the HTML tags when reality all this is or you know this is JavaScript functions so each time you see a tag like this really what's happening is it's creating a new element like you could do normally in JavaScript San Bay says I like your radio do you mean the the free coke amp radio that's going on 24/7 now yeah it's pretty cool if you all haven't checked it out yet I mean I'm sure you've seen it on the channel now we have this this radio station and all the songs are created by free code camp members I don't release it members like it's not like we pay a membership fee or anything but created by by people who are in you know free code camp so it's pretty cool check it out and then there's a live chat going on every time I've been in there there's been at least like 20 people so it's pretty cool like Quincy was in there for a while talking so you never know who's gonna pop in and talk so it's kind of cool just to listen to while you're doing other things throughout the day Emerson says it's cool to know I'm not alone when working with CSS yeah I mean I personally like CSS but it can definitely be tricky sometimes almost to the end here Gander 7 says I hate data import from system with no validation were you talking about the data I was just saying when I was talking about bringing data in yeah I mean right now I'm not worried about it because this is just test stuff but in general you would want to have some validation I'm a little bit more lenient with that when I have control over all the data where it's coming from so it's way less likely that we're gonna get we use the OK gander 7 says notice what I'm working on ok cool cool all right for some reason Google and my phone keeps thinking that I'm talking to it keeps like popping up saying it doesn't recognize my voice it's just weird but anyway all right I've gotten to the end of the live chat I think I'm gonna take a break now because I feel like I need a break and so I'm not gonna put in the the new image so maybe that'll be a surprise for tomorrow that will unveil the the new header image that are the hero image so I have to say goodbye to the cute puppy and and we'll have an actual image of campus let's see oh ok Jeff Miller says I know you're working on the mobile look now but on a desktop the navbar text is compacted together all right let's take a look at that you know what Jeff I'm not seeing it here could you let me know what browser and device you're looking at that with and also the like the browser version if you could so you can just put it here in the in the chat even if it's after the stream ends they'll still be like a minute or two where you can put it in the chat so maybe it's maybe I'm we're using something that doesn't work in all browsers Nietzsche says put the puppy somewhere as an easter egg he's like a mascot by now I was just thinking that as I was saying we're gonna get rid of it I'm thinking like is there a way to put images in the console so that if somebody opens dev tools will see it if there is I think I should definitely do it all right Jeff's astride an edge and Firefox okay I'll have to test it we're definitely gonna have to do some thorough testing before this goes live I'm okay with not testing it that much before the presentation because I'm gonna be displaying it from you know from my computer and so it should be alright I can control the environment but yeah maybe we'll definitely have to figure out what's going on there all right thanks Jeff for pointing that out and for testing it out and you know various ways all right but anyway I think we had a good stream it took longer to do a little thing that I thought it would but we worked through it and that's always I mean that's a win right even if it took longer that's a win we got it to work it looks awesome and you all helped a lot and 2008 yeah happy Valentine's Day for everybody out there also a happy beginning of Lent its Ash Wednesday so for anybody that I guess it's Catholic or even their non Catholics I think that celebrate Lent I think anyway so in our day that we have both happening on the same day but anyway whatever you're celebrating today I hope you have a great day and I'll see you all back tomorrow hopefully hopefully my meetings gonna don't go too long but I should be back maybe around the same time maybe out 1 p.m. Eastern time tomorrow so I'll see you then
