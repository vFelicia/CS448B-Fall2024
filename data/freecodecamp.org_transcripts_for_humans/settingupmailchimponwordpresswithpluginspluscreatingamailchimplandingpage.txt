00:04 - hello keep calm and hackathon
00:08 - hi free code camp my name is jane
00:10 - sorenson and this is the first video
00:13 - that i am doing for you all
00:15 - and i pitched the article to quincy
00:17 - quite by accident back in september when
00:20 - i was starting to create a product and i
00:22 - had no idea how to do a landing page and
00:24 - no idea how to do online marketing
00:27 - and i wanted to be able to just do
00:29 - something quickly with my wordpress and
00:31 - quincy said
00:32 - if you're having a problem with this
00:34 - chances are other users are too so i
00:37 - accepted to do
00:39 - what you're about to see
00:41 - if anything is confusing
00:44 - bounce through
00:46 - my 6 000 word article
00:49 - and ask a question either here on the
00:51 - video if it's relevant or on the article
00:54 - if it's relevant
00:55 - now there is a product that i release on
00:57 - a monthly basis it's a digital download
01:00 - i call it the tactical chronograph and
01:02 - what it is is it's a monthly agenda
01:05 - that you print out at home and you can
01:07 - carry it around by the by the week or
01:10 - carry around the whole month agenda so
01:12 - you can plan your time accordingly
01:14 - because what you put into your phone
01:17 - calendar isn't always sufficient for for
01:20 - planning and keeping track of everything
01:22 - that you want to do
01:23 - so i came up with a nifty design
01:26 - basically responding to my own needs
01:29 - and i started marketing it using this
01:32 - landing page
01:33 - that i'm taking you to right now
01:36 - what we have here is we have a pop-up
01:38 - it's probably a timed pop-up that will
01:40 - go away before i click the x there but i
01:43 - figured out a way
01:44 - so that simply by subscribing to my
01:47 - email list
01:49 - then they click yes i want the tactical
01:51 - chronograph
01:53 - i will automate an email within my email
01:55 - list that will then send them the
01:57 - download link so that they can get
02:00 - the tactical chronograph directly from
02:02 - the link rather than order it in the
02:04 - shop and then click the link to get the
02:06 - download so this is two ways by which
02:09 - people can collect what i'm giving them
02:12 - for free
02:14 - so
02:15 - closing out of that
02:17 - this
02:19 - is my landing page
02:20 - the back end
02:23 - of how this works
02:26 - mailchimp and woocommerce woocommerce is
02:29 - the e-commerce website uh web services
02:32 - that are provided for wordpress users
02:36 - mailchimp and wordpress and
02:38 - woocommerce have an api that connects
02:41 - together
02:42 - so that if somebody uses word
02:44 - woocommerce to order my product and they
02:47 - go through the traditional shop download
02:50 - there is a little check marks button for
02:52 - them to subscribe to my email list
02:55 - mailchimp the mailchimp api will
02:58 - recognize that that person has
03:01 - subscribed to the list through
03:02 - woocommerce and also which product
03:05 - they have bought so that's going to be
03:07 - able to uh
03:09 - cue them up in my email list for any
03:12 - type of automation where i could say
03:15 - people who downloaded the tactical
03:17 - chronograph i would like them to have
03:19 - this particular email campaign
03:23 - then there's also the form and other
03:25 - integrations so this is where you will
03:28 - do the majority of your work
03:31 - here is where you will design a little
03:34 - form that you can use at the bottom of
03:37 - any of your landing pages or any of your
03:39 - blog posts
03:41 - where
03:42 - it just makes it really short and sweet
03:44 - subscribe to the list first name last
03:46 - name is your typical default for it
03:51 - this you have to have connected if you
03:54 - are using wordpress
03:56 - to go into
03:57 - to for wordpress and mailchimp to speak
03:59 - together
04:06 - here
04:07 - despite gdpr
04:09 - i do have usage tracking on
04:12 - usage tracking is a requirement for a
04:15 - mailchimp for those who have fewer than
04:17 - 2 000 users and therefore are using the
04:19 - free account
04:21 - now what this really entails is that
04:25 - you will know when somebody has clicked
04:28 - open your email
04:32 - i don't really get any interaction
04:34 - through the wordpress interface as to
04:36 - what happens between mailchimp and
04:38 - wordpress
04:39 - just that
04:41 - mailchimp knows what product they have
04:42 - ordered
04:43 - and then when i have sent them a
04:45 - campaign according to the product that
04:47 - they have ordered
04:48 - or according to any criteria i can see
04:51 - when somebody has opened one of my
04:53 - emails and when they have clicked one of
04:55 - the links
04:57 - the logging error in warner's
04:59 - warrantings only that's for wordpress
05:00 - developers so that would be you
05:03 - and
05:05 - that's the screen where you have any
05:06 - errors
05:08 - so
05:08 - let us go over to mailchimp and see what
05:12 - they are looking at here
05:14 - projectica
05:15 - is the list i have for this particular
05:17 - website
05:20 - and
05:21 - let me just see if i can create a
05:24 - segment
05:26 - based on information that came from the
05:28 - word chimp and woocommerce integration
05:31 - so contacts that match all
05:35 - let me see
05:38 - now i've made my list for projectica
05:40 - because it has a global audience gdpr
05:43 - ready however probably only two or three
05:47 - subscribers have opted in while under
05:50 - the new gdpr regime
05:53 - so i won't look at those now because
05:55 - that would just merely be a curiosity
05:57 - here we go
05:58 - orders
06:01 - let's see total orders let's see if
06:03 - anybody has ordered two of my products
06:05 - when i really only have three
06:08 - goose egg that means that of the people
06:11 - that have come in through the store
06:13 - they've all only ordered or that word
06:17 - mailchimp and wordpress have noticed
06:18 - that they have ordered
06:20 - one product
06:22 - create a segment
06:24 - let me see
06:26 - where commerce
06:28 - purchase activity
06:30 - has purchased
06:32 - pregnant
06:33 - yes so we have 33 people
06:36 - who have come in
06:38 - through my woocommerce
06:40 - store for one of my products on
06:42 - projectica i hope that gives you a
06:44 - little bit of an overview as to how
06:47 - wordpress and
06:48 - mailchimp has connected themselves
06:51 - together
06:53 - so now let's go back
06:55 - to doing an actual landing page
06:59 - so in june some of us have had our time
07:02 - off this is copy i'm gonna change what
07:04 - better time than to do a little
07:05 - reflection on what you wanted to get
07:07 - done with your year
07:09 - here's where i'm gonna add some media
07:12 - i'm just gonna add a placeholder bit of
07:15 - media i'll just choose this particular
07:17 - image there
07:19 - insert into the post
07:23 - we will center it
07:29 - and say
07:30 - in the caption
07:33 - placeholder
07:36 - for 20 second
07:39 - explainer video
07:44 - you can subscribe
07:50 - email
07:52 - list
07:54 - with
07:55 - this link
07:59 - no caps is needed
08:03 - be
08:04 - cued
08:06 - up to receive it
08:09 - in no time now the reason why this link
08:14 - works
08:16 - is because in that segments that i
08:19 - showed you earlier when i created this
08:21 - segment to test different people
08:24 - i have
08:25 - created a segment called the new hustle
08:29 - chrono opt-ins
08:31 - let's take a look at what i called that
08:35 - new hustle chrono opt-ins means
08:38 - that after the last email campaign was
08:40 - sent on may the 5th may the 4th
08:44 - the sign up source
08:46 - to get the product was through the
08:48 - generic api which is the hustle api
08:52 - connecting to my mailchimp and hustle is
08:55 - a plug-in on my wordpress
08:58 - and
08:59 - i set it up
09:01 - through that that if they were ordering
09:04 - the chronograph
09:06 - that new subscription
09:08 - was going to stick them in a group a
09:11 - project group called chronograph
09:14 - so
09:15 - new subscription
09:17 - where it was immediately added to the
09:18 - group chronograph
09:21 - gets thrown into this new segment so all
09:24 - new subscribers with that will then
09:26 - start receiving this email
09:29 - and go back to the website
09:39 - this link presently
09:41 - i'm going to send them to
09:44 - mailing list
09:49 - which i don't have
09:51 - but
09:53 - i do have a code
09:55 - given by mailchimp for wp
09:59 - for the form
10:01 - so we'll save this draft
10:10 - we will grab
10:12 - this short code right there
10:16 - and we will go back to the post
10:22 - you gotta simply use the back button for
10:24 - it
10:30 - and we're going to drop
10:34 - the form
10:36 - at the bottom of the blog post
10:42 - say sign
10:44 - up
10:45 - in big letters
10:47 - remember these are going to become a
10:48 - button
10:53 - and we're going to create an anchor for
10:55 - it
11:00 - a
11:01 - name
11:02 - equals
11:04 - sign up
11:12 - and i'll just
11:15 - perhaps get the syntax wrong and have to
11:18 - diagnose it later i bet
11:25 - here we go
11:26 - subscribe to the email list
11:28 - link
11:42 - so there's the anchor
11:44 - there's the link to the anchor
11:47 - let's do a preview
11:56 - there you go
11:58 - see that little short code
12:00 - popped up subscribe right there all they
12:04 - have to do is enter first name last name
12:05 - email address
12:08 - let's create a segment
12:12 - where
12:13 - not so much date added
12:17 - as in landing page activity the landing
12:20 - page activity is mailchimp specific
12:22 - landing page a service they offer and
12:25 - i'm going to briefly show you that as
12:26 - well
12:28 - but instead we're going to choose
12:30 - sign up source api generic
12:34 - mailchimp for woocommerce
12:40 - and we're going to add
12:43 - is after
12:46 - a specific date
12:47 - now i'm not going to be
12:49 - making this page live until say saturday
12:54 - so we'll add saturday
12:57 - and here we go i'm now going to show you
13:00 - something that mailchimp has about the
13:03 - landing page service of their own
13:06 - because
13:07 - sometimes having a landing page that is
13:10 - not hosted on your own website
13:12 - you don't need to have wordpress you
13:14 - could be using bootstrap you could be
13:16 - using joomla or jupal or or weebly or
13:20 - wix
13:21 - or
13:22 - squarespace although i'd love to give
13:24 - spare squarespace a try they probably
13:26 - have that covered in a native way very
13:29 - well
13:30 - but mailchimp has a landing page service
13:33 - and i started one
13:37 - a little while ago to give a test as to
13:40 - how it works
13:42 - and here it is tactical chronograph
13:44 - landing page
13:47 - you design the landing page oh that
13:50 - looks funny um you design a landing page
13:53 - exactly like you would be designing
13:57 - a uh an email
13:59 - in within mailchimp
14:03 - and here are the gdpr marketing
14:06 - permissions
14:07 - this is new
14:10 - and so
14:11 - simple content is
14:14 - what the standard tactical chronograph
14:16 - front cover looked like up until june
14:18 - the june cover is going to be different
14:21 - a little example of what it looks like
14:23 - when you're using it
14:25 - and
14:26 - hey
14:28 - this is your call to action grab it
14:31 - grab it right here enter your email and
14:33 - go
14:34 - so that's a really dead simple landing
14:38 - page
14:39 - let's preview it
14:47 - use this space to tell c you're supposed
14:48 - to write some copy here
14:54 - free t-shirt or a downloadable pdf
14:56 - that's exactly what we're doing
14:59 - send me the link
15:02 - that looks pretty nifty i like that
15:05 - i'll like that when it's actually
15:06 - completely done but i really like how
15:09 - dead simple it is here's a cautionary
15:12 - tale though watch out for your graphics
15:14 - see how the background graphic just
15:16 - blows away everything else
15:19 - but at least you have the hero image
15:22 - your call to action
15:24 - your persuasive argument
15:26 - and your email collection and gdpr
15:28 - permissions
15:30 - send me the link
15:31 - i like that
15:32 - let's publish it
15:35 - remember it's not actually fully
15:37 - published until that link is out there
15:39 - for somebody to find and click so there
15:42 - is no risk here in doing this
15:44 - save and continue
15:48 - and we're going to add a page title and
15:51 - say so this one is test
15:55 - landing page
15:59 - tests landing page means nothing to the
16:01 - public let's give it a test
16:07 - test
16:08 - web page
16:12 - for
16:15 - people
16:17 - who
16:19 - want to
16:21 - manage
16:23 - their schedule
16:25 - and diary
16:27 - because it is a diary as well
16:30 - a little better
16:34 - save
16:37 - that is an awfully long url
16:40 - i can edit it you want to have something
16:43 - short this is what i was talking about
16:45 - earlier where it was just slash
16:46 - chronograph instead of slash technical
16:49 - chronograph
16:50 - because
16:52 - people want to type in very short
16:55 - comprehensible
16:56 - urls
16:58 - so we're going to take off people here
17:00 - i'm just going to say
17:04 - manage schedule
17:06 - diary better
17:10 - short memorable still kind of long
17:14 - take out the diary
17:18 - in fact
17:19 - schedule is also a verb
17:21 - so we'll take off
17:23 - manage
17:24 - there
17:26 - we have a nice short girl
17:32 - so the test web page for people who want
17:33 - to manage their scheduling diary a
17:35 - little better
17:36 - there's the earl for it
17:38 - the contacts will be added to projectica
17:42 - let's edit that
17:45 - yes to projectica
17:48 - but it doesn't allow me to add them to a
17:50 - subgroup yet
17:53 - that again would be the segmenting where
17:56 - they recognize landing page activity
17:59 - the content has already been designed
18:03 - the recaptcha is enabled
18:07 - so
18:08 - let's just click publish
18:13 - high five it's live
18:16 - i either will be able to edit it later
18:19 - or i'll be able to replicate it
18:22 - but now i could create an ad if i want
18:24 - to
18:26 - for facebook
18:29 - and i already have an automated welcome
18:31 - email set up for everybody who joins the
18:34 - list
18:37 - like i said you should have a thank you
18:38 - page that that
18:41 - your web page redirects to
18:43 - when people successfully sign up
18:45 - but they should also receive a
18:47 - confirmation email to make sure that
18:49 - they are confirming to the list and then
18:51 - a welcome email that comes after the
18:53 - confirmation email that will include all
18:55 - links to any free content that you're
18:57 - providing them
19:00 - so back to the list
19:03 - projectica
19:05 - and we're creating a segment
19:09 - this one is going to be yes it's auto
19:11 - update by
19:13 - already
19:14 - landing page activity
19:17 - i'm going to say
19:18 - matches any of the following conditions
19:20 - landing a page activity they signed up
19:23 - on the tactical chronograph landing page
19:27 - or
19:29 - date is after a specific date
19:35 - may 25th
19:39 - let's see if there's anything else i
19:41 - want to add to that
19:44 - and i already have a segment for this
19:46 - store however
19:48 - i could still add it in here and that
19:50 - doesn't change anything
19:52 - in the results
19:54 - so product purchased
19:56 - is
20:00 - the tactical chronograph we only want
20:02 - people who are subscribing to it new
20:06 - so for now with just the date added it's
20:08 - going to have to be a dumb list
20:11 - where we're going to assume that
20:12 - everybody who joins list after this date
20:14 - until the next time i go in and change
20:16 - the segmentation rules
20:19 - we're going to assume that they're
20:20 - ordering the tactical chronograph
20:23 - this time it's going to come back with
20:24 - zero i'm going to save it as a segment
20:27 - we're calling it the june
20:30 - tc
20:32 - automated
20:34 - segment
20:37 - and put to check as a note to self
20:41 - that sometimes somebody will land in
20:43 - here when they've ordered a different
20:44 - product
20:48 - there we go
20:50 - so my list has a few different saved
20:51 - segments
20:53 - chrono through wu after may 7th
20:56 - that's people who ordered it in the
20:58 - store
20:59 - new hustle chrono opt-ins that's for
21:02 - people who ordered it through the pop-up
21:03 - that isn't working right yet right yet
21:06 - this is a different product
21:09 - and
21:10 - those went away
21:13 - and this is just anything that they
21:16 - ordered through the store if they check
21:17 - the little subscribe box
21:20 - they get into that segment as well
21:23 - so
21:24 - i hope that makes the uh the process of
21:27 - signing up to a mailing list through
21:32 - wordpress
21:34 - as well as using mailchimp a little bit
21:36 - clearer
21:37 - and some of the important things that
21:39 - you are going to need such as
21:42 - connecting the apis together
21:45 - understanding what your products are
21:48 - and how they can be used to segment a
21:50 - list
21:50 - if you have any comments questions
21:53 - let me know you can always reach me
21:55 - through my own website which is
21:57 - projectica.org
21:59 - you're welcome to also join my tactical
22:01 - chronograph group because everything is
22:03 - free
22:05 - and i'm looking forward to doing more
22:08 - and better videos like this one thanks
22:10 - very much bye and by the way i just
22:12 - wanted to mention who you see in the
22:14 - background particularly taylor right
22:16 - there and somebody who's putting
22:17 - together a 3d printer i've been working
22:20 - this whole time out of the technology
22:22 - sandbox at concordia university and i
22:24 - love it here and i love this giant mac
22:29 - if you can find a space to work in it
22:30 - like a makerspace like me go for it

Cleaned transcript:

hello keep calm and hackathon hi free code camp my name is jane sorenson and this is the first video that i am doing for you all and i pitched the article to quincy quite by accident back in september when i was starting to create a product and i had no idea how to do a landing page and no idea how to do online marketing and i wanted to be able to just do something quickly with my wordpress and quincy said if you're having a problem with this chances are other users are too so i accepted to do what you're about to see if anything is confusing bounce through my 6 000 word article and ask a question either here on the video if it's relevant or on the article if it's relevant now there is a product that i release on a monthly basis it's a digital download i call it the tactical chronograph and what it is is it's a monthly agenda that you print out at home and you can carry it around by the by the week or carry around the whole month agenda so you can plan your time accordingly because what you put into your phone calendar isn't always sufficient for for planning and keeping track of everything that you want to do so i came up with a nifty design basically responding to my own needs and i started marketing it using this landing page that i'm taking you to right now what we have here is we have a popup it's probably a timed popup that will go away before i click the x there but i figured out a way so that simply by subscribing to my email list then they click yes i want the tactical chronograph i will automate an email within my email list that will then send them the download link so that they can get the tactical chronograph directly from the link rather than order it in the shop and then click the link to get the download so this is two ways by which people can collect what i'm giving them for free so closing out of that this is my landing page the back end of how this works mailchimp and woocommerce woocommerce is the ecommerce website uh web services that are provided for wordpress users mailchimp and wordpress and woocommerce have an api that connects together so that if somebody uses word woocommerce to order my product and they go through the traditional shop download there is a little check marks button for them to subscribe to my email list mailchimp the mailchimp api will recognize that that person has subscribed to the list through woocommerce and also which product they have bought so that's going to be able to uh cue them up in my email list for any type of automation where i could say people who downloaded the tactical chronograph i would like them to have this particular email campaign then there's also the form and other integrations so this is where you will do the majority of your work here is where you will design a little form that you can use at the bottom of any of your landing pages or any of your blog posts where it just makes it really short and sweet subscribe to the list first name last name is your typical default for it this you have to have connected if you are using wordpress to go into to for wordpress and mailchimp to speak together here despite gdpr i do have usage tracking on usage tracking is a requirement for a mailchimp for those who have fewer than 2 000 users and therefore are using the free account now what this really entails is that you will know when somebody has clicked open your email i don't really get any interaction through the wordpress interface as to what happens between mailchimp and wordpress just that mailchimp knows what product they have ordered and then when i have sent them a campaign according to the product that they have ordered or according to any criteria i can see when somebody has opened one of my emails and when they have clicked one of the links the logging error in warner's warrantings only that's for wordpress developers so that would be you and that's the screen where you have any errors so let us go over to mailchimp and see what they are looking at here projectica is the list i have for this particular website and let me just see if i can create a segment based on information that came from the word chimp and woocommerce integration so contacts that match all let me see now i've made my list for projectica because it has a global audience gdpr ready however probably only two or three subscribers have opted in while under the new gdpr regime so i won't look at those now because that would just merely be a curiosity here we go orders let's see total orders let's see if anybody has ordered two of my products when i really only have three goose egg that means that of the people that have come in through the store they've all only ordered or that word mailchimp and wordpress have noticed that they have ordered one product create a segment let me see where commerce purchase activity has purchased pregnant yes so we have 33 people who have come in through my woocommerce store for one of my products on projectica i hope that gives you a little bit of an overview as to how wordpress and mailchimp has connected themselves together so now let's go back to doing an actual landing page so in june some of us have had our time off this is copy i'm gonna change what better time than to do a little reflection on what you wanted to get done with your year here's where i'm gonna add some media i'm just gonna add a placeholder bit of media i'll just choose this particular image there insert into the post we will center it and say in the caption placeholder for 20 second explainer video you can subscribe email list with this link no caps is needed be cued up to receive it in no time now the reason why this link works is because in that segments that i showed you earlier when i created this segment to test different people i have created a segment called the new hustle chrono optins let's take a look at what i called that new hustle chrono optins means that after the last email campaign was sent on may the 5th may the 4th the sign up source to get the product was through the generic api which is the hustle api connecting to my mailchimp and hustle is a plugin on my wordpress and i set it up through that that if they were ordering the chronograph that new subscription was going to stick them in a group a project group called chronograph so new subscription where it was immediately added to the group chronograph gets thrown into this new segment so all new subscribers with that will then start receiving this email and go back to the website this link presently i'm going to send them to mailing list which i don't have but i do have a code given by mailchimp for wp for the form so we'll save this draft we will grab this short code right there and we will go back to the post you gotta simply use the back button for it and we're going to drop the form at the bottom of the blog post say sign up in big letters remember these are going to become a button and we're going to create an anchor for it a name equals sign up and i'll just perhaps get the syntax wrong and have to diagnose it later i bet here we go subscribe to the email list link so there's the anchor there's the link to the anchor let's do a preview there you go see that little short code popped up subscribe right there all they have to do is enter first name last name email address let's create a segment where not so much date added as in landing page activity the landing page activity is mailchimp specific landing page a service they offer and i'm going to briefly show you that as well but instead we're going to choose sign up source api generic mailchimp for woocommerce and we're going to add is after a specific date now i'm not going to be making this page live until say saturday so we'll add saturday and here we go i'm now going to show you something that mailchimp has about the landing page service of their own because sometimes having a landing page that is not hosted on your own website you don't need to have wordpress you could be using bootstrap you could be using joomla or jupal or or weebly or wix or squarespace although i'd love to give spare squarespace a try they probably have that covered in a native way very well but mailchimp has a landing page service and i started one a little while ago to give a test as to how it works and here it is tactical chronograph landing page you design the landing page oh that looks funny um you design a landing page exactly like you would be designing a uh an email in within mailchimp and here are the gdpr marketing permissions this is new and so simple content is what the standard tactical chronograph front cover looked like up until june the june cover is going to be different a little example of what it looks like when you're using it and hey this is your call to action grab it grab it right here enter your email and go so that's a really dead simple landing page let's preview it use this space to tell c you're supposed to write some copy here free tshirt or a downloadable pdf that's exactly what we're doing send me the link that looks pretty nifty i like that i'll like that when it's actually completely done but i really like how dead simple it is here's a cautionary tale though watch out for your graphics see how the background graphic just blows away everything else but at least you have the hero image your call to action your persuasive argument and your email collection and gdpr permissions send me the link i like that let's publish it remember it's not actually fully published until that link is out there for somebody to find and click so there is no risk here in doing this save and continue and we're going to add a page title and say so this one is test landing page tests landing page means nothing to the public let's give it a test test web page for people who want to manage their schedule and diary because it is a diary as well a little better save that is an awfully long url i can edit it you want to have something short this is what i was talking about earlier where it was just slash chronograph instead of slash technical chronograph because people want to type in very short comprehensible urls so we're going to take off people here i'm just going to say manage schedule diary better short memorable still kind of long take out the diary in fact schedule is also a verb so we'll take off manage there we have a nice short girl so the test web page for people who want to manage their scheduling diary a little better there's the earl for it the contacts will be added to projectica let's edit that yes to projectica but it doesn't allow me to add them to a subgroup yet that again would be the segmenting where they recognize landing page activity the content has already been designed the recaptcha is enabled so let's just click publish high five it's live i either will be able to edit it later or i'll be able to replicate it but now i could create an ad if i want to for facebook and i already have an automated welcome email set up for everybody who joins the list like i said you should have a thank you page that that your web page redirects to when people successfully sign up but they should also receive a confirmation email to make sure that they are confirming to the list and then a welcome email that comes after the confirmation email that will include all links to any free content that you're providing them so back to the list projectica and we're creating a segment this one is going to be yes it's auto update by already landing page activity i'm going to say matches any of the following conditions landing a page activity they signed up on the tactical chronograph landing page or date is after a specific date may 25th let's see if there's anything else i want to add to that and i already have a segment for this store however i could still add it in here and that doesn't change anything in the results so product purchased is the tactical chronograph we only want people who are subscribing to it new so for now with just the date added it's going to have to be a dumb list where we're going to assume that everybody who joins list after this date until the next time i go in and change the segmentation rules we're going to assume that they're ordering the tactical chronograph this time it's going to come back with zero i'm going to save it as a segment we're calling it the june tc automated segment and put to check as a note to self that sometimes somebody will land in here when they've ordered a different product there we go so my list has a few different saved segments chrono through wu after may 7th that's people who ordered it in the store new hustle chrono optins that's for people who ordered it through the popup that isn't working right yet right yet this is a different product and those went away and this is just anything that they ordered through the store if they check the little subscribe box they get into that segment as well so i hope that makes the uh the process of signing up to a mailing list through wordpress as well as using mailchimp a little bit clearer and some of the important things that you are going to need such as connecting the apis together understanding what your products are and how they can be used to segment a list if you have any comments questions let me know you can always reach me through my own website which is projectica.org you're welcome to also join my tactical chronograph group because everything is free and i'm looking forward to doing more and better videos like this one thanks very much bye and by the way i just wanted to mention who you see in the background particularly taylor right there and somebody who's putting together a 3d printer i've been working this whole time out of the technology sandbox at concordia university and i love it here and i love this giant mac if you can find a space to work in it like a makerspace like me go for it
