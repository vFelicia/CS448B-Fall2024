00:00 - in this video we are going to learn how
00:01 - to create a parallax effect for our
00:04 - webpage
00:05 - so this is the webpage that we are going
00:07 - to design so when we scroll down we can
00:09 - see that we have this parallax effect
00:12 - where
00:13 - this
00:14 - element over here is moving faster than
00:18 - the image
00:19 - and we also have a different type of
00:21 - parallax where
00:22 - the image stays where it is and
00:26 - the division moves above it so
00:29 - these are the two different parallaxes
00:31 - that we are going to design and we are
00:33 - going to use
00:34 - html css and
00:36 - javascript
00:38 - so let's get started so in my project i
00:41 - have these three files index.html
00:44 - main.js and style.css and i also have
00:48 - two different images in my img folder so
00:51 - let's design the html markup
00:53 - we will use emmett to create the basic
00:56 - html structure so
00:59 - here we will just give it a title called
01:01 - parallax
01:03 - and we will also
01:06 - link our css so link
01:09 - and the name of our css file
01:12 - and in our body tag we will attach our
01:15 - script file so
01:19 - it is called main.js
01:22 - so if you see over here we can see that
01:24 - we have one two three and four different
01:27 - divisions
01:28 - so let's design those divisions
01:31 - so i will just type
01:33 - div
01:34 - four and it will give me four different
01:37 - divisions
01:38 - and here i will create an h2 and i will
01:41 - just type div one
01:44 - and i'll just copy this
01:49 - so we have our divisions set up
01:52 - now we will just give a basic styling
01:54 - for our website so first of all we will
01:57 - open this with our live server
02:00 - so these are the four divisions we'll go
02:02 - to our style.css and here first of all
02:05 - we will have a
02:08 - border of 0 and padding of 0 and
02:13 - margin of 0
02:15 - for all the elements
02:18 - and here we will style all the divisions
02:21 - so it will have a display of flex
02:25 - and align items
02:28 - to the center
02:30 - justify content to the center
02:32 - font weight to
02:34 - bold font family
02:40 - to
02:42 - big john
02:43 - and a width of 100 percent and a height
02:48 - of 100 viewport height
02:51 - so these are all our divisions
02:54 - and
02:55 - now we will style the h2
02:57 - so i'll type h2
02:59 - and here i will give it a font size
03:02 - of 60 pixels
03:06 - and a background color
03:08 - of
03:10 - light gray
03:11 - a padding of 8 pixels 24 pixels
03:16 - and border radius
03:20 - of
03:21 - 16 pixels
03:23 - now we will style each of the divisions
03:25 - separately so
03:26 - we will type div
03:28 - and child
03:30 - one so this will select the first
03:31 - division
03:33 - and we will give it a background
03:37 - image
03:39 - and give it a url of
03:46 - d1.jpg
03:47 - so this is our image so
03:50 - we will give it a background size of
03:53 - cover so that
03:54 - it will
03:56 - adjust the size according to the window
03:59 - and now we will style the second
04:00 - division so div
04:03 - and child 2
04:05 - and here
04:06 - we just have to give a background color
04:08 - of
04:10 - maroon
04:12 - so this is the second division now for
04:14 - the third division
04:16 - we will give
04:18 - a height of
04:19 - 400 pixels
04:23 - and we'll give a background image
04:27 - and we will give it a url of
04:29 - img
04:31 - d3.jpg
04:33 - and the background
04:35 - size should be set to cover
04:40 - and at last the
04:42 - fourth division so end
04:45 - child four
04:47 - and we'll give it a background color
04:50 - of
04:53 - aquamarine
04:55 - so if we take a look at this we can see
04:59 - that we have all the divisions styled
05:01 - properly so first of all i will show you
05:04 - this basic parallax that we had over
05:07 - here
05:08 - so this parallax effect where
05:10 - the divisions moving over it but the
05:12 - image stays where it is
05:14 - so that is really simple so we can do it
05:18 - in our css itself
05:20 - so here for our
05:22 - division three
05:24 - we just have to add one line of code
05:26 - that is
05:28 - background
05:29 - attachment and set it to fixed
05:33 - so this will give us that parallax
05:35 - effect so if we'll scroll down
05:37 - we can see that we have this parallax
05:40 - effect over here where
05:41 - the divisions move
05:43 - over it and the image stays where it is
05:46 - now we will give the padlocks effect
05:49 - that we had for our division one so that
05:52 - the image moves
05:54 - a bit slower than all the other elements
05:57 - so for that we have to go to our
05:59 - javascript file so we have already added
06:02 - our javascript file over here so in our
06:05 - main js we'll create a constant and name
06:08 - it parallax
06:11 - and we have to access
06:12 - the first division so
06:15 - what we'll do is create an id over here
06:18 - for the division so
06:20 - id parallax
06:23 - and here
06:24 - we will say document dot get element by
06:27 - id
06:29 - and say parallax over here so this will
06:31 - fetch this division over here and now we
06:34 - have to add an event listener for our
06:36 - window object so i will type window dot
06:39 - add event listener
06:41 - and we will
06:42 - search for the scroll event and
06:45 - we'll just create an anonymous function
06:49 - and create a variable called offset
06:53 - and we will set that equal to window
06:55 - dot page
06:58 - y offset
07:00 - so this is gonna be the value of how
07:02 - much the user has scrolled from the top
07:06 - i'll just open my console
07:11 - so we'll just print the offset value in
07:13 - our console so
07:15 - here we will type
07:16 - console.log
07:19 - and say
07:21 - offset
07:25 - and here we will type offset
07:28 - so now if we'll save this and open our
07:32 - console
07:33 - and if you and if you scroll down
07:37 - we can see we get the value of offset
07:40 - so this is how much the user has
07:42 - scrolled down so if you scroll down more
07:44 - we can see
07:46 - we get this value over here and if we
07:48 - scroll all the way to the top we get the
07:50 - value of offset to be zero
07:53 - so this is what we are going to use in
07:55 - our parallax effect
07:57 - so let me just show you one more value
07:59 - that we need to have
08:01 - so
08:02 - i'll just console.log
08:05 - and
08:06 - this is the offset
08:09 - multiplied by 0.7
08:13 - so we will type offset
08:16 - times 0.7
08:18 - and now if we scroll down we can see
08:20 - that we have two different offset values
08:23 - so this is the offset
08:24 - and this is offset multiplied by 0.7 so
08:29 - this is the value that we get
08:31 - so we are going to use
08:33 - this value over here to move our image
08:36 - so if the page is scrolled to 36 pixels
08:40 - our image will be scrolled to 25.2
08:43 - pixels
08:44 - so this is how our code is going to work
08:47 - so
08:49 - let me just delete
08:50 - both of these consoles and here we will
08:53 - type parallax
08:55 - dot style
08:57 - dot background position y
09:00 - and we will set that equal to offset
09:04 - times
09:05 - 0.7
09:07 - and here we also need to add pixels
09:10 - so
09:11 - this is our code for the parallax
09:14 - and now if we go over here and scroll
09:16 - down
09:18 - we can see that we have this padlax
09:20 - effect over here
09:21 - so this is how this padlocks works so if
09:24 - we change this value to say one
09:28 - and now we can see that the image stays
09:30 - there so it is just like the
09:33 - fixed property that we had used over
09:35 - here and if we change these values to
09:39 - maybe greater than 1
09:41 - so if we change it to 1.5
09:44 - now if we scroll we can see that the
09:46 - image moves in the opposite direction
09:49 - so this is basically how this pan-lex
09:51 - effect works so let me just change it
09:53 - back to
09:54 - 0.7 which
09:56 - looks fine to me
09:58 - so this is basically it for this
10:00 - tutorial
10:01 - i hope that you understood how to create
10:03 - a parallax effect using
10:06 - simple javascript without using all the
10:08 - jquery and all those libraries you can
10:11 - use this simple six lines of javascript
10:13 - code and create this panlax effect
10:16 - and you can change these values and get
10:19 - different kinds of effects so if i
10:21 - change it to
10:22 - 0.2 pixels
10:24 - the image will scroll a bit faster
10:27 - so we can see that over here so if you
10:30 - have any doubts you can ask them in the
10:32 - comments below and if you enjoyed this

Cleaned transcript:

in this video we are going to learn how to create a parallax effect for our webpage so this is the webpage that we are going to design so when we scroll down we can see that we have this parallax effect where this element over here is moving faster than the image and we also have a different type of parallax where the image stays where it is and the division moves above it so these are the two different parallaxes that we are going to design and we are going to use html css and javascript so let's get started so in my project i have these three files index.html main.js and style.css and i also have two different images in my img folder so let's design the html markup we will use emmett to create the basic html structure so here we will just give it a title called parallax and we will also link our css so link and the name of our css file and in our body tag we will attach our script file so it is called main.js so if you see over here we can see that we have one two three and four different divisions so let's design those divisions so i will just type div four and it will give me four different divisions and here i will create an h2 and i will just type div one and i'll just copy this so we have our divisions set up now we will just give a basic styling for our website so first of all we will open this with our live server so these are the four divisions we'll go to our style.css and here first of all we will have a border of 0 and padding of 0 and margin of 0 for all the elements and here we will style all the divisions so it will have a display of flex and align items to the center justify content to the center font weight to bold font family to big john and a width of 100 percent and a height of 100 viewport height so these are all our divisions and now we will style the h2 so i'll type h2 and here i will give it a font size of 60 pixels and a background color of light gray a padding of 8 pixels 24 pixels and border radius of 16 pixels now we will style each of the divisions separately so we will type div and child one so this will select the first division and we will give it a background image and give it a url of d1.jpg so this is our image so we will give it a background size of cover so that it will adjust the size according to the window and now we will style the second division so div and child 2 and here we just have to give a background color of maroon so this is the second division now for the third division we will give a height of 400 pixels and we'll give a background image and we will give it a url of img d3.jpg and the background size should be set to cover and at last the fourth division so end child four and we'll give it a background color of aquamarine so if we take a look at this we can see that we have all the divisions styled properly so first of all i will show you this basic parallax that we had over here so this parallax effect where the divisions moving over it but the image stays where it is so that is really simple so we can do it in our css itself so here for our division three we just have to add one line of code that is background attachment and set it to fixed so this will give us that parallax effect so if we'll scroll down we can see that we have this parallax effect over here where the divisions move over it and the image stays where it is now we will give the padlocks effect that we had for our division one so that the image moves a bit slower than all the other elements so for that we have to go to our javascript file so we have already added our javascript file over here so in our main js we'll create a constant and name it parallax and we have to access the first division so what we'll do is create an id over here for the division so id parallax and here we will say document dot get element by id and say parallax over here so this will fetch this division over here and now we have to add an event listener for our window object so i will type window dot add event listener and we will search for the scroll event and we'll just create an anonymous function and create a variable called offset and we will set that equal to window dot page y offset so this is gonna be the value of how much the user has scrolled from the top i'll just open my console so we'll just print the offset value in our console so here we will type console.log and say offset and here we will type offset so now if we'll save this and open our console and if you and if you scroll down we can see we get the value of offset so this is how much the user has scrolled down so if you scroll down more we can see we get this value over here and if we scroll all the way to the top we get the value of offset to be zero so this is what we are going to use in our parallax effect so let me just show you one more value that we need to have so i'll just console.log and this is the offset multiplied by 0.7 so we will type offset times 0.7 and now if we scroll down we can see that we have two different offset values so this is the offset and this is offset multiplied by 0.7 so this is the value that we get so we are going to use this value over here to move our image so if the page is scrolled to 36 pixels our image will be scrolled to 25.2 pixels so this is how our code is going to work so let me just delete both of these consoles and here we will type parallax dot style dot background position y and we will set that equal to offset times 0.7 and here we also need to add pixels so this is our code for the parallax and now if we go over here and scroll down we can see that we have this padlax effect over here so this is how this padlocks works so if we change this value to say one and now we can see that the image stays there so it is just like the fixed property that we had used over here and if we change these values to maybe greater than 1 so if we change it to 1.5 now if we scroll we can see that the image moves in the opposite direction so this is basically how this panlex effect works so let me just change it back to 0.7 which looks fine to me so this is basically it for this tutorial i hope that you understood how to create a parallax effect using simple javascript without using all the jquery and all those libraries you can use this simple six lines of javascript code and create this panlax effect and you can change these values and get different kinds of effects so if i change it to 0.2 pixels the image will scroll a bit faster so we can see that over here so if you have any doubts you can ask them in the comments below and if you
