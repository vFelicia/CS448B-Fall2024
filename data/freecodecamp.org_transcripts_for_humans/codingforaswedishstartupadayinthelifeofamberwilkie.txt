00:01 - hi i'm amber and i'm a programmer i work
00:04 - for a small startup called student
00:05 - vicaria and today is a day in my life
00:09 - i'm halfway to work uh let's keep going
00:12 - [Music]
00:23 - so i walk to work every day uh well
00:26 - unless it's raining because
00:28 - uh it takes about 40 minutes and it's
00:30 - free and this is my favorite part of my
00:33 - walk i have this canal and there's
00:35 - normally a whole bunch of ducks here but
00:37 - today there's no ducks maybe they're
00:39 - camera shy
00:40 - uh actually today i'm super late because
00:42 - i've been fiddling with this video so
00:44 - i'm gonna keep moving
00:46 - [Music]
00:51 - [Laughter]
00:59 - this is my colleague speaking swedish
01:24 - i just got to work
01:25 - and uh i'm a little sweaty from walking
01:28 - as always i'm going to go get
01:30 - some cheese and crackers for breakfast
01:32 - and coffee and then i'm going to check
01:34 - slack
01:35 - and do some code reviews my clock and
01:38 - that means it's time for our stand-up
01:41 - i'll take a photo or two to show you
01:44 - what that looks like we're gonna chat
01:45 - with our polish colleagues who work on
01:48 - the app and also our most senior
01:51 - developer who happens to be a contractor
01:53 - who works on everything
02:01 - okay so it's 1007. we just did stand up
02:04 - we were missing almost everyone so it
02:06 - was a very short stand-up
02:09 - i've been at work for about an hour
02:11 - currently what i'm doing is working on a
02:13 - bug
02:14 - affecting the salaries of our students
02:19 - we're running several a b tests and if
02:21 - it turns out that this bug has been
02:23 - there all the time then we've just sort
02:26 - of wasted a bunch of money giving people
02:29 - extra money and if
02:31 - it's only been two weeks which is when a
02:33 - major refactor happened to this code
02:35 - which fingers crossed it's only been two
02:37 - weeks and then we can just throw out
02:39 - that data
02:41 - this is very typical i go on slack in
02:43 - the morning and one of our support staff
02:45 - has reported a bug or some problem that
02:48 - is actually critical to fix now um like
02:51 - this one is specifically potentially
02:53 - costing us money right now um so i'm
02:56 - gonna work on this until it's fixed and
02:58 - then i'll do code reviews
03:01 - test suite takes like 12 minutes to run
03:07 - so now it's 11 12. i'm on coffee number
03:10 - two
03:11 - and i squashed that bug so that's good
03:14 - uh thankfully it was only two weeks
03:16 - worth of data that has been
03:19 - unusable for us so the other couple of
03:21 - months that it's been running it's good
03:23 - to go
03:24 - i did code reviews i
03:26 - approved some code and i rejected some
03:29 - code
03:30 - because it didn't work
03:31 - and now i'm going to get back to the
03:33 - thing that i knew i was coming when i
03:34 - came in this morning and that is a big
03:37 - refactor currently in our system users
03:40 - can have one school and we want them to
03:43 - be able to work with multiple schools so
03:45 - that's what i'm gonna get back to
03:46 - working on now
03:49 - okay so midday check-in um it's about 12
03:53 - 15 and i need to go get some lunch
03:56 - because we have an all hands meeting at
03:59 - one every monday and it's monday um i
04:02 - typically like to eat lunch around that
04:04 - time so if i don't go early and get
04:06 - lunch then i have to wait sometimes till
04:08 - two o'clock and that's super late don't
04:09 - want to do it
04:11 - today has been a pretty good day so far
04:13 - it's actually been pretty standard i've
04:17 - dealt with a few bugs that were sitting
04:19 - in slack when i came in
04:21 - and i have worked on some features i'm
04:24 - almost ready with this big refactor of
04:27 - users can have multiple schools that's
04:28 - taken me a couple days actually i was
04:30 - working on that last week
04:32 - all friday
04:33 - but it's almost ready to go
04:36 - i did get some feedback on the bug i
04:38 - fixed this morning and my code was also
04:40 - rejected so i need to work on that some
04:43 - more too but i'm not worried about it
04:44 - because the business logic that is
04:47 - handled by that particular
04:49 - piece of code um basically like no more
04:52 - bookings are going to be made this
04:54 - morning that are going to fall into that
04:56 - box so i'm not worried about doing that
04:58 - right away because i'm sure i can do it
05:00 - this afternoon and then it will all work
05:03 - out before tomorrow morning's
05:05 - new set
05:07 - so i'm going to head over to the grocery
05:10 - store they have a cafeteria type
05:13 - situation i'll take a few pics for you
05:14 - guys
05:16 - [Music]
05:28 - it's
05:29 - three o'clock in the afternoon and we've
05:31 - been working all day
05:33 - and i thought i'd introduce you to the
05:35 - team that's lisa
05:50 - top this one's henrik he's the boss wait
05:54 - hey guys
05:55 - i'm here being managerial
05:57 - you work with a lot of r
05:59 - i do i do some data science when i'm not
06:02 - doing other stuff and you manage things
06:04 - well you guys are quite easy to manage
06:07 - so
06:10 - and this one's lisa
06:11 - lucia she's italian hi
06:14 - yes
06:18 - what an international office right
06:20 - [Music]
06:30 - so we resolved the bugs from this
06:32 - morning they've been they've gone
06:34 - through code review and they'll soon be
06:36 - in production
06:37 - and now it's time to look at the pivotal
06:40 - tracker to see what stories i should
06:42 - work on next
06:44 - okay uh
06:46 - 3 40 we got about hour and a half left
06:49 - in the day maybe a little bit more
06:51 - and i'm going to switch gears i've been
06:53 - learning a bit of r we have a hackathon
06:56 - coming up this weekend lucia and lisa
06:58 - and i are going to go
06:59 - and hack for sweden and uh so i need to
07:04 - get my art shops up fortunately um we
07:07 - have some r projects in our
07:11 - repertoire as a company they analyze our
07:13 - data and i am trying to learn r so i can
07:15 - help work on those
07:17 - so i'm going to run some tutorials and
07:19 - i'm going to take a stab at a new
07:21 - application we need for analyzing the
07:24 - company's data
07:29 - here oh
07:30 - poppy
07:35 - so it's five and ordinarily i would stay
07:38 - at work a little bit later but today i
07:40 - have a dance class so i'm going to leave
07:43 - right after i record this video
07:46 - today was a pretty good day i squashed
07:49 - two bugs that we're giving our support
07:52 - staff some trouble and i finished a
07:54 - major refactor that is going to kind of
07:56 - open up some paths for us to do some
07:59 - more development in the future i
08:01 - collaborated with
08:03 - my
08:04 - counterpart
08:05 - our contractor in poland he helps a lot
08:08 - with
08:10 - the work that we do and we could not do
08:12 - it without him
08:13 - on our team it's as i mentioned it's
08:15 - it's me and lucy and lisa and henrik
08:17 - um
08:18 - and that's not quite enough programming
08:21 - for the work that we have to do so we
08:23 - have these other people the app team
08:26 - were around uh even though they weren't
08:28 - on stand-up
08:30 - um other quick facts about working in
08:32 - sweden
08:33 - my
08:34 - lovely ux designer uh and also johan
08:38 - who's our
08:39 - honorary tech member
08:42 - uh they're gonna have babies soon and
08:44 - together no not together
08:47 - uh separate babies two different babies
08:49 - and uh they'll get 18
08:52 - months of combined parental leave that
08:55 - the both partners must take very
08:57 - important and um everybody makes about
08:59 - the same amount of money like of course
09:01 - there's fluctuations but like if you
09:03 - don't if you make too little the
09:04 - government will just give you more and
09:05 - if you make too much the government will
09:06 - like tax you a lot so everybody's kind
09:08 - of smushed into this middle bit
09:15 - working for a product company is really
09:16 - great because i'm really close to the
09:19 - um
09:20 - the users of my products the port staff
09:22 - so we work really really fast we like i
09:25 - got bugs in this morning and i fix them
09:27 - by the afternoon and part of the reason
09:28 - that we can do that is because our
09:31 - we're like kind of free to make mistakes
09:34 - in a way because the support staff will
09:35 - come and say hey you broke this and we
09:37 - can fix it within a few hours
09:39 - um
09:42 - yeah
09:42 - gosh i could talk so much but you've
09:45 - seen me all day so i will just say
09:47 - goodbye from sweden hayward
09:51 - as it were and thanks for watching
