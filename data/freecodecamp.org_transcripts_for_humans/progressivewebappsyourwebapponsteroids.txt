With timestamps:

00:03 - so thanks for coming uh my name is
00:05 - maxons and i'm pretty happy to be here
00:07 - in indiana this is the first time for me
00:10 - and for now i i really like the city so
00:13 - it's really cool
00:14 - uh we're gonna talk for
00:16 - i'm gonna talk for for the next hour
00:18 - about
00:19 - the the progressive web apps uh
00:22 - yes
00:25 - all of my slide everything uh this is my
00:27 - slide deck um pu dot f slash torque
00:31 - i'm gonna give some
00:33 - some numbers etc so if you want to check
00:35 - the source uh even if you want to to see
00:37 - back the the slide after go
00:40 - go here
00:41 - after you just need to select uh
00:44 - the correct uh the quest torque which is
00:47 - a progressive way back
00:50 - okay
00:51 - so
00:52 - this is the the starting points of
00:55 - of my torch
00:56 - um months ago
00:59 - i read the i
01:01 - i started to find on the on the
01:04 - on twitter on some blog posts were
01:06 - talking about native apps and according
01:08 - to some people
01:09 - uh they were
01:11 - doomed so
01:14 - i start to to dig into uh into that and
01:18 - i find some interesting
01:20 - studios interesting statistics about it
01:24 - first of all
01:26 - fifty percent of the american user
01:29 - download zero up per month
01:32 - uh
01:33 - then only ten percent download one app
01:36 - amounts and after 110 etc
01:40 - okay i also find that
01:43 - most of the time we spend on our
01:45 - smartphone is on the
01:47 - three
01:48 - on the top three app
01:50 - and also
01:52 - uh less points it's more about revenue
01:55 - uh
01:56 - it's pretty hard if you are doing uh
01:59 - an active application to get revenue
02:01 - from this
02:03 - if you are out of this um
02:05 - this publish also all the google et
02:07 - cetera
02:11 - there is another problem if if your
02:14 - company got an app it's hard to to reach
02:16 - people
02:17 - what i mean is on every step you got for
02:21 - on every step you are losing 20 percent
02:23 - of the user so you have to find an app
02:27 - you lost 20 users then you click on the
02:29 - detail you lost uh 20 user etc etc etc
02:33 - so at the end if if you want to reach
02:36 - 1000 user at the end maybe
02:39 - uh
02:40 - 262 according to this today uh
02:43 - 262 yeah it's it's an average but gonna
02:47 - use the app
02:48 - and on this 262
02:51 - uh
02:52 - the studies say
02:55 - 50 50 75
02:57 - of the user download an app
02:59 - use it once and never come back
03:02 - on the day two we get uh we are more
03:05 - than eighty percent
03:07 - until at three months after or even
03:12 - yeah three months after we got something
03:13 - close to five percent of the user we
03:16 - still use your application
03:19 - the the reason is
03:22 - one of the reason is sometimes we have
03:25 - to to download an app and we don't
03:27 - really want it when i came here in
03:28 - vienna i had to install the an app for
03:31 - um
03:33 - for lutzfenza i think
03:35 - uh i'm just gonna use this app once and
03:38 - look it's
03:40 - yeah it was pretty similar something
03:41 - like 40 megabytes
03:43 - just to show one qr code to the
03:48 - yeah
03:48 - on the airport that's
03:51 - only why i need an app
03:53 - for this after there is some use case
03:55 - it's still relevant
03:59 - about
04:00 - uh about reachability also
04:04 - um
04:05 - because of all of this friction it's
04:07 - hard for you to
04:10 - to get new customers on the
04:13 - on your app
04:14 - and on the other hand
04:17 - a mobile
04:18 - with the web it's
04:20 - pretty more simple to reach new
04:23 - customers
04:29 - but
04:30 - but uh
04:32 - if you got an app you probably you
04:34 - probably know that
04:36 - the user spend more time on the on the
04:38 - native app than a mobile application
04:42 - why
04:44 - the answer is pretty simple
04:48 - you got notification the user got
04:51 - already taken on the
04:53 - on the desktop so
04:56 - yeah there is more engagement
05:01 - so let's summarize we got
05:03 - two things we got the mobile app and the
05:05 - website
05:06 - we with the mobile app we can do a lot
05:09 - of things
05:11 - there is a lot of capability etc but the
05:14 - rich ability is really hard
05:16 - and
05:17 - here my web app
05:20 - i can reach a lot of people but i cannot
05:22 - retain them
05:25 - so
05:26 - some people mostly from from google they
05:30 - they start from from this starting point
05:32 - and say okay how to put uh how to
05:35 - increase
05:36 - the my website
05:38 - and get something with more capabilities
05:42 - so that's
05:46 - that's the main uh
05:48 - yeah the main reason to you to switch to
05:50 - something called the the progressive web
05:52 - apps
05:54 - so we're gonna try to
05:56 - put at the same level uh
05:59 - in term of functionalities
06:01 - an active app on a web app
06:07 - the progressive web apps
06:09 - it's
06:10 - uh
06:11 - it's just a set of
06:13 - of correct rule that your web apps
06:16 - have to
06:17 - have to reach
06:19 - so take care you don't need to update
06:21 - your
06:21 - your linkedin profile right now
06:23 - you probably do some some of them
06:26 - the first one one of the first rule is
06:30 - get links
06:35 - one page you got one link welcome to
06:37 - http protocol something it's pretty
06:39 - basic so i'm not gonna stay longer on
06:41 - this slide
06:43 - um
06:44 - i was talking about http
06:47 - we could add an s you recognize the lock
06:49 - here
06:53 - for years
06:55 - people
06:56 - didn't switch to https because of monet
06:59 - they did not want to buy a certificate
07:02 - i have a good news since
07:04 - 2016 now
07:06 - there is something called let some
07:07 - scripts
07:08 - and now
07:09 - this organization provide a free
07:12 - certificate
07:14 - and
07:15 - no it's not from hipster or bitnix look
07:18 - there is a lot of
07:21 - look dispenser i mean we can trust this
07:28 - okay the third point really basic as
07:32 - well responsive
07:34 - uh if you still don't know what's
07:36 - responsive
07:37 - remember this picture from stephanie
07:39 - walter
07:40 - uh let me and she said
07:47 - yeah content content is like it's like
07:49 - water so don't want to put all the data
07:51 - from this screen to you to your mobile
07:55 - it's do something uh yeah responsive to
07:58 - adapt to
07:59 - to the device
08:02 - now we start to to reach something a bit
08:04 - more interesting because you probably
08:06 - already follow all this
08:07 - this third
08:09 - yeah this three step
08:10 - the first the fourth one is uh getting
08:13 - something more uh app-like
08:17 - so
08:18 - when you are using a progressive web app
08:20 - you should not think about i am on the
08:22 - web i am on the app now it should see it
08:26 - should be the the same experience
08:31 - there is something interesting called
08:33 - the application
08:35 - architecture
08:37 - so given i'm i'm a shop and i want to
08:41 - to show some
08:44 - to show some clothes
08:45 - george.com did that
08:50 - the cash they put
08:52 - this
08:53 - and the
08:55 - the left um
08:56 - sorry the left
08:58 - the left screen so all the architecture
09:00 - etc you keep it uh
09:03 - it's instant instantly loaded and then
09:06 - you do a asynchronous request to the
09:09 - network and you go and you fetch uh the
09:11 - data on when the data are here it's feed
09:14 - the
09:17 - it it fit the screen you got something
09:19 - pretty similar if you are using
09:23 - microsoft teams it's an equivalent to
09:26 - to
09:28 - to slack and there is also this i think
09:30 - in
09:32 - in facebook when you scroll really
09:33 - really fast you just see the
09:35 - architecture
09:38 - here also an interesting study
09:41 - george.com reduced the the page load
09:44 - by 3.8 by using this
09:47 - so it's something very interesting yeah
09:51 - the fifth point
09:53 - the fifth point is uh getting something
09:56 - uh progressive
10:02 - there is a framework i'm using which is
10:03 - called uh
10:04 - with uh i'm using in my company it's
10:06 - called ugs and they say it's a
10:08 - progressive framework it means
10:11 - you can use this
10:13 - uh you can create some small components
10:15 - in this technology in the
10:18 - old-fashioned websites
10:20 - without breaking everything etc
10:23 - so here it's kind of the same
10:26 - there is a lot of diversity of browsers
10:29 - so if you want to add something fancy
10:33 - in your browser it should not impact the
10:35 - the whole browsers
10:39 - because yes unfortunately not every
10:42 - browser are the same this is a screen
10:45 - from
10:46 - firefox firefox
10:48 - 58
10:49 - so as you can see
10:52 - i cannot
10:54 - i cannot do some bluetooth usb nfc etc
10:58 - but
10:59 - if i check it with my chrome here
11:04 - i think i'm gonna get something slightly
11:07 - different
11:18 - yeah
11:20 - i don't see it
11:21 - yeah for instance uh this and the
11:24 - background background sync etc it's not
11:26 - the same in firefox than in
11:30 - in chrome
11:43 - the six points it's getting
11:46 - a fresh
11:47 - application fresh by fresh i mean always
11:50 - up to date
11:53 - there is something here a new world
11:55 - service workers i will come back in this
11:57 - notion
11:58 - just after
12:01 - the idea behind this is uh
12:04 - to get an application always up to date
12:07 - here if you see this is my uh an app
12:10 - from my bank i updated
12:13 - four days ago and they already asked me
12:15 - to um
12:17 - to do an update
12:19 - well sometime it's it's not a big deal
12:22 - but when i need this app
12:26 - i sometimes i just need it right now
12:28 - like
12:30 - this is what i get
12:32 - the other day
12:33 - i came back from from work and i just
12:36 - wanted to
12:37 - to play to my race game and i got this
12:40 - screen say
12:41 - not today
12:43 - well here it's okay it's 48 megabits but
12:46 - sometime it's even more and it's pretty
12:48 - annoying
12:49 - so the idea behind this is to use
12:52 - something called the
12:56 - background sync
12:59 - to use some tasks in background to
13:02 - update your app
13:03 - um
13:07 - if you are using some browsers like uh
13:10 - firefox chrome it's they're working like
13:12 - this
13:14 - you get an update and they just say oh
13:17 - next time you're gonna you're gonna
13:19 - reload the browser we're gonna get uh
13:20 - you're gonna get a new uh
13:23 - you're gonna get a new
13:24 - a new version but
13:26 - that
13:27 - don't block you
13:29 - so this is the id
13:35 - the seventh point is um about
13:38 - installation
13:39 - as i said before um
13:43 - something good with your uh with native
13:45 - apps is you get the icon on the screen
13:48 - so here the id is exactly the same
13:52 - you should be able to get
13:54 - your web
13:56 - your web icon on screen
13:59 - oops
14:01 - this is the progressive web apps i did
14:04 - with this ugs framework and it's based
14:07 - on the
14:08 - github api so i call it github
14:11 - if you see here
14:14 - there is a small house with a plus
14:16 - so it means
14:18 - it's a progressive web apps you can
14:19 - install
14:21 - you can install this app
14:24 - so if i click here i will get something
14:27 - like this do you want to add
14:29 - this application on your screen
14:31 - i click on add tool screen
14:34 - and here i got it like this so this is
14:36 - my phone
14:38 - you got two icons here in the middle one
14:41 - from
14:42 - firefox and the other one from chrome
14:47 - and
14:48 - the difference between uh
14:51 - this and the shortcut because you know
14:53 - sometimes you can just take a shortcut
14:54 - on the website and put it on your
14:57 - on your on your home
15:00 - on your home page but here it's
15:03 - considered by your um
15:07 - by your uh sorry
15:09 - your um your operating system as an
15:11 - application which means i can after find
15:13 - it if
15:14 - i want to find an application in my
15:16 - phone
15:22 - there is also
15:24 - something so this slide are
15:27 - progressive web apps friendly which
15:29 - means i can also install them
15:32 - so i'm on chrome here
15:34 - and if i want to
15:37 - to install my application wait
15:49 - here i just need i clicked add to home
15:51 - screen
15:55 - and it doesn't work
16:02 - oh no my bad i didn't so look uh there
16:05 - is a at this application to your shelf
16:09 - so you click add
16:12 - and cool my browser is
16:15 - gone
16:18 - well demo effects
16:21 - okay
16:24 - let's restart this
16:29 - okay
16:30 - instead
16:32 - i inspect
16:35 - i go under
16:38 - application
16:40 - at home screen
16:42 - add okay add to uh add to your desktop
16:45 - so here this is how it's working ubuntu
16:49 - and after i got something pretty weird
16:51 - here uh so i click
16:54 - i say trust on launch
16:56 - and
16:57 - tada i got my slide and it's look like
17:00 - uh it's look like an app
17:03 - and look i can also here put it on my uh
17:06 - on my dock you got something pretty
17:08 - similar on
17:09 - osx i didn't test on uh
17:11 - on microsite on microsoft
17:21 - the full screen
17:25 - i didn't test it on microsoft so so yeah
17:27 - every uh
17:29 - every browser got a different way of
17:31 - handling this uh this small house the
17:33 - the install button um
17:35 - i think in
17:37 - in opera it's on the left it's also look
17:39 - like uh it's there is also a plus
17:43 - in chrome you must visit the page uh two
17:46 - time to to get this
17:50 - and
17:51 - yeah that's it the
17:53 - oh
17:54 - you you might think okay it's good oh
17:57 - can i get the this plus button on my on
17:59 - my website
18:00 - there is something called um
18:02 - the manifest.json
18:04 - uh it's it's a web app manifest and
18:07 - it's allow your application to be
18:09 - discoverable
18:13 - so the web app the json it's it's a file
18:16 - where you can put
18:18 - some different uh
18:20 - some different information about your uh
18:24 - about your your web app so you get the
18:26 - name a short name the short name is for
18:29 - the it's to put it on the on the screen
18:31 - on the on your home screen
18:33 - then you got a set of icons
18:37 - as far as remember for chrome you need
18:40 - an icon with 500 pixels something like
18:44 - this
18:45 - start url it's the entry point
18:48 - um
18:51 - check out i put a source equal on screen
18:55 - if you if you check the the spec of the
18:58 - of the web app manifest they say you can
19:01 - you can do this for
19:05 - analytics so after if you got some
19:08 - google analytics or something like this
19:09 - you can say okay i got 10 percent of
19:11 - users using this
19:13 - this web apps from the screen
19:18 - also display fullscreen
19:20 - if you check on my web app on my when i
19:23 - when i checked just before the
19:24 - installation you didn't sew the
19:28 - you didn't sew all the the panel from
19:30 - from the browser and
19:32 - mostly the most important here is we
19:35 - don't see the url bar
19:37 - so it's really look like an
19:39 - a real app from
19:41 - from your phone and after you can put
19:42 - some background color on time color
19:45 - i got another example here so i'm still
19:48 - on chrome
19:51 - if you want to to check
19:55 - your web app manifest on chrome you got
19:57 - the the developers tools and you just
20:00 - yeah go on manifest
20:03 - you will see the the name the shot name
20:05 - etc
20:07 - and the add to home screen so
20:09 - if something is wrong google will
20:11 - the tool will tell you and say oh
20:14 - i cannot add it on the screen because of
20:16 - this this so here
20:19 - i put this
20:21 - some colors and i got all of my sets of
20:24 - icons
20:25 - something cool
20:27 - there is a lot of website you just put
20:29 - one icon and degenerates everything
20:31 - including the the manifest.json so it's
20:34 - pretty easy to do
20:39 - also i was talking about uh microsoft i
20:42 - said i don't i don't know oh how did
20:44 - they manage this but i got the good news
20:50 - microsoft want to crawl all the
20:52 - progressive web app from the from the
20:54 - web
20:56 - convert them into something real i don't
20:59 - know what is app x but after what what
21:01 - they want to do is to
21:04 - to put them in the windows store so
21:07 - as a real application
21:10 - i think it's something really cool but
21:12 - look i put the scientist here so it's
21:15 - it's still in draft
21:16 - so we have to wait they say 2018 so i
21:19 - think but it was in
21:22 - september so i think we have to wait
21:24 - something like six months and after
21:26 - maybe we're gonna see some
21:27 - application in the microsoft store
21:30 - so here for
21:32 - to reach new customer it can be pretty
21:35 - good
21:40 - another point to increase the
21:42 - engagements
21:43 - with your customers
21:45 - is then
21:47 - the notification
21:51 - you probably saw it already in some
21:52 - website
21:53 - well sometime it's a bit annoying
21:55 - because when you open a website say okay
21:59 - can i send you a notification so you
22:01 - accept all your decline
22:03 - and it looks like this
22:05 - so i have to turn off
22:07 - on here
22:09 - when i click
22:10 - i got some notification from uh
22:13 - from the um
22:15 - yeah the operating system and here
22:18 - say okay so you got uh you get a
22:20 - notification from the application called
22:22 - pwa
22:23 - this is the website and this is a
22:26 - message
22:42 - and now
22:43 - the
22:46 - about
22:48 - connection um
22:50 - because the 10 point the
22:53 - this point is about
22:55 - making a websites offline because the
22:59 - the best request is no request
23:03 - it was my face when i saw this i say
23:05 - well
23:06 - i have to do a website
23:08 - offline
23:10 - uh
23:11 - yeah let's explain how it's work oh no
23:13 - before why
23:15 - why well we are in good country with
23:17 - really nice internet connection but
23:19 - unfortunately it's not the same
23:21 - everywhere
23:24 - so yeah in australia it's pretty good uh
23:27 - i'm working in ireland it's pretty good
23:28 - too but if you check in
23:31 - uh some country in asia in africa in
23:33 - south america it's not good
23:37 - well even in france
23:39 - it's one of the best but i'm sure when
23:41 - my parents gonna see this talk on
23:42 - youtube they will not see it in hd
23:44 - because they got a pretty pretty bad
23:46 - connection
23:47 - and also something that we have to keep
23:49 - in mind
23:50 - it's
23:52 - 45 percent of the world population
23:55 - it's still on 2g network
24:00 - so we have to think about these people
24:01 - there is still people in africa they
24:04 - download
24:07 - what the name
24:08 - an android app and after they can give
24:10 - them to each other in uh
24:12 - by usb
24:14 - so yeah unfortunately not everybody got
24:16 - a really fast
24:18 - wi-fi
24:21 - so how does it work
24:23 - uh
24:23 - there is something called a service
24:25 - worker this is a web page on the network
24:29 - something really basic if you want to to
24:31 - see the
24:32 - the page you do an http get to
24:36 - to the network
24:39 - and
24:41 - something is coming in the in the
24:43 - browser well it's already here but
24:47 - the the document from the w3c is still
24:50 - in draft but it's already implemented in
24:53 - all the browsers
24:54 - basically you got
24:56 - your web page
24:58 - if you want to to access to the network
25:00 - there is something in the middle called
25:02 - service worker
25:03 - um it's not only a proxy some people
25:06 - resume a service worker as a proxy but
25:08 - it's
25:10 - it can do much more
25:11 - but
25:12 - the interesting part for
25:15 - from this point is what we can do with
25:17 - the service worker so i want to access
25:19 - to the network and the service worker
25:22 - say oh i saw this request
25:24 - maybe i can put it in the cache so then
25:26 - if you want to get it again
25:29 - you just need to call the cache
25:32 - and all of this is browser side
25:37 - when i saw this i say wow it's pretty
25:39 - cool because now i can do a lot of
25:41 - things in my in my application
25:44 - jake archibald wrote something called
25:46 - the offline cookbook and in this offline
25:49 - cookbook he gave us some
25:52 - some pattern from offline strategy
25:55 - this one is catch first
25:58 - you want to load a page
26:00 - so first you add to the to the cache if
26:03 - there is no nothing in the cache then
26:04 - you fall back on the network
26:10 - is another one it's
26:11 - the opposite
26:12 - it's network network first otherwise
26:15 - you're going the cache
26:22 - yeah for instance if i'm a shop and i
26:24 - want to show the product i can use this
26:27 - but maybe for a really sensitive data
26:29 - like the price or the availability maybe
26:32 - i want to to do something like network
26:35 - only so
26:36 - no way you don't put anything in the
26:38 - cache
26:42 - some more interesting
26:44 - the cache then network
26:46 - so look i asked
26:49 - in parallel to the cache
26:51 - and to the network
26:53 - the cache returned me the data
26:55 - and the on the same time
26:57 - i'm going on the
26:59 - on the network and after i can retrieve
27:00 - the data so while i'm navigating on the
27:02 - website the data so first at t0
27:06 - i got the the data from the cache
27:09 - and after why i'm navigating the data
27:11 - are getting up to date
27:14 - something pretty similar it's my
27:15 - favorite it's
27:17 - style while revalidates um you always
27:20 - saw the
27:22 - the assets but from a
27:24 - t minus one uh from
27:27 - the last time you
27:29 - you were on the on the website it can be
27:30 - interesting for assets like javascript
27:32 - files css etc
27:36 - so first page the user so the so when
27:39 - the user go in your website it saw the
27:41 - the result from yesterday
27:43 - or for uh the last time you went to your
27:46 - website and etc
27:49 - but
27:50 - if you got a single page application
27:52 - maybe it doesn't make sense but if you
27:54 - don't have a single page application a
27:55 - website like facebook usually you don't
27:57 - do only one click you just
27:59 - you reload the page several times so on
28:01 - the first page you get the version from
28:03 - yesterday maybe but the page load
28:05 - instantly and on the second page
28:08 - you got the
28:10 - some up-to-date data
28:13 - so i gave you
28:14 - some few strategies for offline there is
28:18 - much more in the in this website uh in
28:20 - this cookbook i recommend you to take a
28:22 - look
28:22 - and yeah you can also follow this guy
28:24 - jake archibald is a pretty good guy from
28:28 - from google
28:30 - now how does it work how does it work
28:33 - all of this or i can do that on my
28:35 - website
28:37 - this is some javascript
28:39 - code
28:40 - basically everything is based on promise
28:42 - but
28:43 - i don't know about you but
28:45 - sometimes it can be a bit annoying to
28:47 - to write
28:48 - very huge text
28:50 - use um
28:52 - huge cut
28:53 - code just to to manage my assets there
28:56 - is something called workbox workbox it's
28:59 - a pretty good tool uh
29:01 - sponsored by google by the way
29:03 - and
29:04 - basically it looks like this so on the
29:06 - first parameter of this function so so i
29:09 - define some routes and i say okay
29:11 - everything which look like a png gif
29:16 - etc on the image
29:18 - i want to apply a cache first strategy
29:22 - i can also put some fancy name like
29:25 - the the name of of the cache gonna be
29:27 - image uh you only store 60 or 60 image
29:32 - and for a duration of 30 days
29:36 - or if you want something way more simple
29:38 - you can do something like this
29:40 - here i want to store all the http calls
29:45 - from
29:46 - the
29:47 - github api
29:48 - and then i want to apply the
29:51 - network first
29:52 - strategy i'm sorry for you there is no
29:55 - uh
29:56 - you have to deal with regex so if you
29:58 - are not
29:59 - if like me you are not a big fan of
30:01 - regex it can be a small issue
30:11 - now let's switch to the 11 points single
30:14 - page application
30:16 - no i'm joking
30:17 - and hopefully there is a lot of people
30:19 - that say you have to be
30:21 - you have to build a single page
30:23 - application to do a progressive web apps
30:25 - it's wrong
30:26 - and it's something pretty cool because
30:28 - building and second page application is
30:30 - hard
30:32 - so
30:33 - no single page application
30:36 - so
30:37 - let's summarize
30:39 - this is my definition of
30:41 - a progressive web app it's just
30:43 - something really cool like this
30:46 - so you got a website on the privacy web
30:48 - app but it's not really professional so
30:51 - let's switch to
30:52 - to another definition from alex russell
30:57 - another guy from google which is working
30:58 - on progressive web apps
31:01 - it's a
31:02 - it said uh a pwa it's nothing else than
31:06 - a website which take the good vitamin
31:08 - what are this good vitamin
31:10 - so let's summarize it's something
31:12 - reliable so https you can get it
31:16 - even if you are offline
31:19 - also
31:20 - it's fast
31:21 - thanks to the service workers
31:24 - and
31:25 - you can
31:26 - get some engage you can better engage
31:28 - the
31:30 - your your customers with uh by
31:33 - installing the application getting some
31:35 - um
31:38 - what's the name
31:40 - notification etc
31:44 - another great tool to help you to build
31:46 - uh
31:47 - the best pwa it's lighthouse
31:51 - lighthouse you get it by default on
31:53 - chrome
31:54 - so
31:55 - i opened
31:58 - the dev tools here and you get
32:01 - a pan called audit
32:03 - and here you can click
32:05 - to perform an edit
32:07 - you select what you want so here let's
32:09 - select everything and
32:13 - um lighthouse will scroll your website
32:16 - check uh about performance how
32:18 - performance it is and 2g network
32:23 - so blah blah blah and after it will it
32:25 - will give you a report so here i'm
32:28 - probably gonna blame me for the
32:32 - for the performance because uh
32:36 - i got a lot of image and i did not fully
32:38 - optimize them
32:39 - and maybe also gonna complain for
32:42 - some stuff because i put some css in the
32:44 - html it's not really nice but
32:47 - it's not the
32:49 - the goal
32:54 - do i need to wait no i don't have time
32:56 - to
32:58 - wait
33:01 - so yeah you can see
33:03 - what it is doing and here i got my
33:05 - results here so i'm 64 compliant with
33:09 - progressive web app
33:10 - so
33:12 - there is problem because my application
33:13 - doesn't register a service worker
33:16 - i don't i probably break something
33:19 - here you can also get some the first
33:22 - meaningful paint this is really
33:24 - interesting even if you don't want to
33:25 - build a pwa
33:27 - you can get some good insight
33:30 - from your websites say okay i have to
33:33 - optimize this this to get a better seo
33:36 - something good with lighthouse you can
33:38 - also put it in cli
33:41 - so by using it cli it's mean you can use
33:44 - it in your
33:46 - in your pipeline ci cd etc
33:51 - another point really important it's
33:53 - speed matter
33:56 - i like this picture this is the team
33:59 - from red bull they are changing four
34:00 - tires
34:02 - in two seconds
34:04 - while the average page load on the 3g
34:07 - network is 19 seconds
34:11 - well 19 seconds
34:13 - it's
34:14 - really slow i don't know why well no we
34:17 - know basically it's because of the
34:19 - analytics
34:20 - non-optimization etc
34:25 - and something you have to keep in mind
34:27 - about
34:28 - speed if
34:31 - half of the pers of the half of the
34:33 - people expect your website to load in
34:35 - less than two seconds and if your
34:37 - website
34:38 - load in more than three seconds
34:41 - yeah three seconds
34:43 - you lost fifty percent
34:46 - uh
34:47 - 50 percent will bounce
34:50 - so
34:51 - it can be something really nice if you
34:52 - want to to sell pwa in your in your
34:54 - company
34:56 - check the bounce rate
35:00 - but
35:00 - unfortunately today um
35:04 - there is things that we still cannot do
35:07 - in your in a progressive web app like i
35:09 - cannot access to nfc to the calendar to
35:12 - my contact list
35:14 - so we have to wait
35:16 - if you remember the the screen from uh
35:18 - the the screen i show you uh about what
35:20 - the web can do
35:22 - uh it's changing it's moving it's moving
35:24 - really fast
35:25 - so
35:27 - uh i discovered yesterday something
35:29 - called the no not yesterday but
35:32 - a few weeks ago something called um web
35:35 - payments api there is a lot of friction
35:37 - today in uh
35:39 - in your application if you want to sell
35:41 - something
35:43 - basically
35:44 - on my phone there is something pretty
35:45 - good is when i want to buy
35:47 - it's already linked to my google
35:49 - accounts it's pretty fast to buy
35:50 - something on uh on a mobile on a mobile
35:54 - app but on the web you have to take your
35:56 - wallet the credit card etc
35:58 - so yeah to avoid this friction they are
36:01 - developing this payment request api
36:05 - and i think i did this in
36:07 - some
36:08 - really few line of javascripts you can
36:11 - get something like this
36:13 - so
36:13 - here i give you a link if you want to
36:15 - buy an iphone for 10 euro
36:18 - it's look like this
36:19 - and
36:20 - i got something from the browser here
36:23 - and
36:24 - i got the detail of of my bills
36:28 - here i can put the
36:31 - my credit card and i just need to click
36:33 - on pay and that's it
36:35 - i don't need it so i will not pay it
36:41 - also
36:42 - unfortunately the user yet
36:45 - are not really used to this
36:48 - to this install button
36:50 - so
36:51 - i don't know maybe in few years people
36:54 - will use this but for now there is still
36:56 - a reflex to go on the on the store so
37:01 - they have to work on it
37:03 - if you check the the first version of
37:05 - the install button and what is it today
37:07 - it changed a lot so they are
37:10 - they're still trying to find the best
37:11 - way to engage user uh through this this
37:14 - button
37:18 - now
37:20 - the last part is about feedbacks
37:24 - some companies move to to prohibit web
37:27 - apps and they give feedback to the
37:28 - community
37:30 - the first one is
37:32 - twitter
37:34 - if you remember the map i saw you i show
37:37 - you in africa for instance there is no
37:39 - uh the network is pretty low um company
37:42 - like twitter
37:44 - want to keep this market and want to
37:46 - better reach these markets so they
37:48 - create something called twitter lit uh
37:51 - it's
37:53 - it's just twitter but uh
37:56 - you
37:57 - in http request you just take what you
38:00 - need to so the there is less less less
38:03 - more uh request
38:05 - i think the the full home page only took
38:07 - one way one megabits one megabyte to
38:09 - load
38:10 - uh it's much more for the other app
38:14 - um
38:16 - and yeah
38:17 - when they did this app after this
38:20 - they take some metrics and it's pretty
38:22 - interesting to see that
38:25 - because the app is better there is
38:27 - better performance on the
38:30 - with the browser etc so the user use
38:33 - more the applications 65 percent it's a
38:35 - lot so and also people people
38:38 - use more apps they tweet more and
38:41 - they come back more often the 20
38:45 - also uh ford did
38:47 - something pretty similar they switched
38:48 - to pwa
38:51 - plus 100 engagements
38:54 - it's pretty good
38:56 - it's
38:57 - well it's awesome
38:59 - the user use more the application and
39:02 - yeah you got the
39:04 - the source it's also on
39:06 - developer.google.com
39:08 - it's a really good resource to switch to
39:10 - to pwa or to get some insight from
39:12 - company that switched to pwa
39:16 - so it's yeah the developer blog from
39:18 - google
39:20 - and also the the last one is uh what
39:23 - pinterest did pinterest
39:26 - for me it's the the most
39:29 - most important study from from them um
39:32 - so they say okay let's go to pwa and
39:35 - they realize that
39:37 - people stay more on the app they consume
39:39 - more they get more money because they
39:42 - are based on
39:44 - they use advertising fortunately
39:46 - unfortunately for us
39:48 - there is more engagements and after they
39:51 - also did something interesting and they
39:52 - compiled the
39:54 - the statistic from the native app
39:57 - and from the
39:58 - the web app
39:59 - and they realized that it's
40:01 - kind of the same so if you remember
40:05 - at the beginning
40:06 - i was showing you this diagram so
40:09 - today
40:10 - we're here it's in the same level it's
40:12 - not in the same level to be fairly
40:14 - honest but
40:16 - it's changing a lot there is a lot of
40:18 - improvement
40:20 - from the browser it's changing fast so
40:22 - maybe yesterday you didn't wanted
40:24 - a native app for some reason but now you
40:26 - can do it because
40:29 - your web apps can access to your
40:31 - positions your localization you can also
40:34 - buy
40:35 - on your mobile etc so keep an eye on
40:38 - keep an eye on this website what web can
40:40 - do today etc because yeah it's moving
40:44 - it's moving really fast
40:46 - thank you
40:48 - [Applause]
40:53 - i think i got time for some questions
41:04 - no uh so your question is is it possible
41:07 - today
41:09 - to be in the
41:11 - in the application store application
41:12 - store you mean uh the android store and
41:14 - the ios one uh for now the answer is no
41:18 - um
41:20 - there is nothing already checked
41:24 - the only thing is plan is from the
41:25 - microsoft store to put pwa
41:28 - [Music]
41:30 - after i think there is a reason
41:32 - there is a reason why they didn't talk
41:35 - about it it's also because um
41:39 - um
41:41 - because you have to follow some rules
41:43 - mostly for the i think the ios
41:46 - for ios they scan or they scroll your
41:49 - your application et cetera and follow
41:52 - for a web app it's a bit harder to
41:54 - to check what's inside and
41:57 - so for me it's
41:59 - it's the reason after maybe it's gonna
42:02 - change i don't know
42:05 - any other questions
42:19 - so if it's the end the question if it's
42:22 - if it's the end of the native app
42:27 - well
42:27 - i don't have my crystal ball
42:34 - some people say native apps are dooms it
42:36 - was the the introduction
42:40 - i truly believe that today the
42:43 - progressive web app on in few few years
42:46 - they're gonna get challenged
42:49 - um
42:50 - does it still relevant today to build uh
42:52 - to build native apps yes for some
42:54 - companies it's
42:56 - they're making all of the the money here
42:59 - uh after i also saw some even some
43:02 - applications they were only on the
43:04 - on native apps and they switched also to
43:06 - web apps like um tinder they switched to
43:09 - pwa there is a nice blog
43:11 - still on google and they're giving some
43:13 - insight
43:16 - so people
43:18 - so people are switching to to this
43:21 - because there is a need
43:26 - i don't know if if it's gonna get
43:29 - replaced
43:32 - from my point of view yes but
43:34 - i'm pretty i'm not really good for
43:35 - prediction so
43:42 - uh
43:46 - yeah i also put if you check on the on
43:48 - the slide i put some uh some tools also
43:51 - there is one called pwa builder
43:55 - they help you to generate your money
43:56 - first there is a web
43:58 - webpagetest.org to measure the
44:00 - performance of your website
44:03 - yeah also oh yeah you were asking if
44:05 - it's still relevant
44:07 - the native apps it was on my backup
44:08 - slide
44:10 - this is the trend from uh from facebook
44:13 - so
44:14 - the world go on mobile so
44:17 - yes it's relevant to still building uh
44:20 - native apps but pwa for me it's also
44:23 - really interesting because the
44:25 - the mobile on the web
44:28 - it's still the same it doesn't decrease
44:33 - so yeah
44:42 - uh
44:44 - because basically native app has access
44:57 - ah okay
44:59 - yeah
45:00 - uh well i think you can so it's well
45:05 - here
45:06 - so your question is uh
45:09 - what's the website about your privacy
45:12 - right so if there's access to
45:15 - uh i think it's there
45:17 - yeah you got it in chrome settings so
45:20 - you can see here
45:22 - for instance uh your web app can access
45:25 - to your geo localization without asking
45:27 - you
45:30 - i was a bit scared when i saw this i say
45:32 - wow uh
45:33 - they can check a lot of things
45:36 - yeah so your gps localization they don't
45:39 - need to to ask you they can access it
45:41 - directly
45:43 - so here the notification by default ilo
45:46 - but you can also block them but
45:48 - the most important things to watch is
45:50 - what you can get by default
45:53 - so yeah here the camera well not here
45:56 - the location it's the default so they
45:59 - need to ask
46:01 - maybe it was on firefox it's by default
46:03 - i don't really remember
46:10 - so yeah
46:13 - after you you have to uh some stuff are
46:15 - blocks for some of them they allow by
46:18 - default so you have to keep an eye on it
46:19 - uh
46:21 - but yeah
46:22 - something good also with your native
46:24 - apps you know what
46:25 - what they need uh
46:30 - is that answer to your question there
46:31 - yeah
46:34 - i think it's okay for the time
46:37 - maybe a quick class question no it's
46:39 - okay
46:42 - okay thank you very much
46:45 - [Applause]

Cleaned transcript:

so thanks for coming uh my name is maxons and i'm pretty happy to be here in indiana this is the first time for me and for now i i really like the city so it's really cool uh we're gonna talk for i'm gonna talk for for the next hour about the the progressive web apps uh yes all of my slide everything uh this is my slide deck um pu dot f slash torque i'm gonna give some some numbers etc so if you want to check the source uh even if you want to to see back the the slide after go go here after you just need to select uh the correct uh the quest torque which is a progressive way back okay so this is the the starting points of of my torch um months ago i read the i i started to find on the on the on twitter on some blog posts were talking about native apps and according to some people uh they were doomed so i start to to dig into uh into that and i find some interesting studios interesting statistics about it first of all fifty percent of the american user download zero up per month uh then only ten percent download one app amounts and after 110 etc okay i also find that most of the time we spend on our smartphone is on the three on the top three app and also uh less points it's more about revenue uh it's pretty hard if you are doing uh an active application to get revenue from this if you are out of this um this publish also all the google et cetera there is another problem if if your company got an app it's hard to to reach people what i mean is on every step you got for on every step you are losing 20 percent of the user so you have to find an app you lost 20 users then you click on the detail you lost uh 20 user etc etc etc so at the end if if you want to reach 1000 user at the end maybe uh 262 according to this today uh 262 yeah it's it's an average but gonna use the app and on this 262 uh the studies say 50 50 75 of the user download an app use it once and never come back on the day two we get uh we are more than eighty percent until at three months after or even yeah three months after we got something close to five percent of the user we still use your application the the reason is one of the reason is sometimes we have to to download an app and we don't really want it when i came here in vienna i had to install the an app for um for lutzfenza i think uh i'm just gonna use this app once and look it's yeah it was pretty similar something like 40 megabytes just to show one qr code to the yeah on the airport that's only why i need an app for this after there is some use case it's still relevant about uh about reachability also um because of all of this friction it's hard for you to to get new customers on the on your app and on the other hand a mobile with the web it's pretty more simple to reach new customers but but uh if you got an app you probably you probably know that the user spend more time on the on the native app than a mobile application why the answer is pretty simple you got notification the user got already taken on the on the desktop so yeah there is more engagement so let's summarize we got two things we got the mobile app and the website we with the mobile app we can do a lot of things there is a lot of capability etc but the rich ability is really hard and here my web app i can reach a lot of people but i cannot retain them so some people mostly from from google they they start from from this starting point and say okay how to put uh how to increase the my website and get something with more capabilities so that's that's the main uh yeah the main reason to you to switch to something called the the progressive web apps so we're gonna try to put at the same level uh in term of functionalities an active app on a web app the progressive web apps it's uh it's just a set of of correct rule that your web apps have to have to reach so take care you don't need to update your your linkedin profile right now you probably do some some of them the first one one of the first rule is get links one page you got one link welcome to http protocol something it's pretty basic so i'm not gonna stay longer on this slide um i was talking about http we could add an s you recognize the lock here for years people didn't switch to https because of monet they did not want to buy a certificate i have a good news since 2016 now there is something called let some scripts and now this organization provide a free certificate and no it's not from hipster or bitnix look there is a lot of look dispenser i mean we can trust this okay the third point really basic as well responsive uh if you still don't know what's responsive remember this picture from stephanie walter uh let me and she said yeah content content is like it's like water so don't want to put all the data from this screen to you to your mobile it's do something uh yeah responsive to adapt to to the device now we start to to reach something a bit more interesting because you probably already follow all this this third yeah this three step the first the fourth one is uh getting something more uh applike so when you are using a progressive web app you should not think about i am on the web i am on the app now it should see it should be the the same experience there is something interesting called the application architecture so given i'm i'm a shop and i want to to show some to show some clothes george.com did that the cash they put this and the the left um sorry the left the left screen so all the architecture etc you keep it uh it's instant instantly loaded and then you do a asynchronous request to the network and you go and you fetch uh the data on when the data are here it's feed the it it fit the screen you got something pretty similar if you are using microsoft teams it's an equivalent to to to slack and there is also this i think in in facebook when you scroll really really fast you just see the architecture here also an interesting study george.com reduced the the page load by 3.8 by using this so it's something very interesting yeah the fifth point the fifth point is uh getting something uh progressive there is a framework i'm using which is called uh with uh i'm using in my company it's called ugs and they say it's a progressive framework it means you can use this uh you can create some small components in this technology in the oldfashioned websites without breaking everything etc so here it's kind of the same there is a lot of diversity of browsers so if you want to add something fancy in your browser it should not impact the the whole browsers because yes unfortunately not every browser are the same this is a screen from firefox firefox 58 so as you can see i cannot i cannot do some bluetooth usb nfc etc but if i check it with my chrome here i think i'm gonna get something slightly different yeah i don't see it yeah for instance uh this and the background background sync etc it's not the same in firefox than in in chrome the six points it's getting a fresh application fresh by fresh i mean always up to date there is something here a new world service workers i will come back in this notion just after the idea behind this is uh to get an application always up to date here if you see this is my uh an app from my bank i updated four days ago and they already asked me to um to do an update well sometime it's it's not a big deal but when i need this app i sometimes i just need it right now like this is what i get the other day i came back from from work and i just wanted to to play to my race game and i got this screen say not today well here it's okay it's 48 megabits but sometime it's even more and it's pretty annoying so the idea behind this is to use something called the background sync to use some tasks in background to update your app um if you are using some browsers like uh firefox chrome it's they're working like this you get an update and they just say oh next time you're gonna you're gonna reload the browser we're gonna get uh you're gonna get a new uh you're gonna get a new a new version but that don't block you so this is the id the seventh point is um about installation as i said before um something good with your uh with native apps is you get the icon on the screen so here the id is exactly the same you should be able to get your web your web icon on screen oops this is the progressive web apps i did with this ugs framework and it's based on the github api so i call it github if you see here there is a small house with a plus so it means it's a progressive web apps you can install you can install this app so if i click here i will get something like this do you want to add this application on your screen i click on add tool screen and here i got it like this so this is my phone you got two icons here in the middle one from firefox and the other one from chrome and the difference between uh this and the shortcut because you know sometimes you can just take a shortcut on the website and put it on your on your on your home on your home page but here it's considered by your um by your uh sorry your um your operating system as an application which means i can after find it if i want to find an application in my phone there is also something so this slide are progressive web apps friendly which means i can also install them so i'm on chrome here and if i want to to install my application wait here i just need i clicked add to home screen and it doesn't work oh no my bad i didn't so look uh there is a at this application to your shelf so you click add and cool my browser is gone well demo effects okay let's restart this okay instead i inspect i go under application at home screen add okay add to uh add to your desktop so here this is how it's working ubuntu and after i got something pretty weird here uh so i click i say trust on launch and tada i got my slide and it's look like uh it's look like an app and look i can also here put it on my uh on my dock you got something pretty similar on osx i didn't test on uh on microsite on microsoft the full screen i didn't test it on microsoft so so yeah every uh every browser got a different way of handling this uh this small house the the install button um i think in in opera it's on the left it's also look like uh it's there is also a plus in chrome you must visit the page uh two time to to get this and yeah that's it the oh you you might think okay it's good oh can i get the this plus button on my on my website there is something called um the manifest.json uh it's it's a web app manifest and it's allow your application to be discoverable so the web app the json it's it's a file where you can put some different uh some different information about your uh about your your web app so you get the name a short name the short name is for the it's to put it on the on the screen on the on your home screen then you got a set of icons as far as remember for chrome you need an icon with 500 pixels something like this start url it's the entry point um check out i put a source equal on screen if you if you check the the spec of the of the web app manifest they say you can you can do this for analytics so after if you got some google analytics or something like this you can say okay i got 10 percent of users using this this web apps from the screen also display fullscreen if you check on my web app on my when i when i checked just before the installation you didn't sew the you didn't sew all the the panel from from the browser and mostly the most important here is we don't see the url bar so it's really look like an a real app from from your phone and after you can put some background color on time color i got another example here so i'm still on chrome if you want to to check your web app manifest on chrome you got the the developers tools and you just yeah go on manifest you will see the the name the shot name etc and the add to home screen so if something is wrong google will the tool will tell you and say oh i cannot add it on the screen because of this this so here i put this some colors and i got all of my sets of icons something cool there is a lot of website you just put one icon and degenerates everything including the the manifest.json so it's pretty easy to do also i was talking about uh microsoft i said i don't i don't know oh how did they manage this but i got the good news microsoft want to crawl all the progressive web app from the from the web convert them into something real i don't know what is app x but after what what they want to do is to to put them in the windows store so as a real application i think it's something really cool but look i put the scientist here so it's it's still in draft so we have to wait they say 2018 so i think but it was in september so i think we have to wait something like six months and after maybe we're gonna see some application in the microsoft store so here for to reach new customer it can be pretty good another point to increase the engagements with your customers is then the notification you probably saw it already in some website well sometime it's a bit annoying because when you open a website say okay can i send you a notification so you accept all your decline and it looks like this so i have to turn off on here when i click i got some notification from uh from the um yeah the operating system and here say okay so you got uh you get a notification from the application called pwa this is the website and this is a message and now the about connection um because the 10 point the this point is about making a websites offline because the the best request is no request it was my face when i saw this i say well i have to do a website offline uh yeah let's explain how it's work oh no before why why well we are in good country with really nice internet connection but unfortunately it's not the same everywhere so yeah in australia it's pretty good uh i'm working in ireland it's pretty good too but if you check in uh some country in asia in africa in south america it's not good well even in france it's one of the best but i'm sure when my parents gonna see this talk on youtube they will not see it in hd because they got a pretty pretty bad connection and also something that we have to keep in mind it's 45 percent of the world population it's still on 2g network so we have to think about these people there is still people in africa they download what the name an android app and after they can give them to each other in uh by usb so yeah unfortunately not everybody got a really fast wifi so how does it work uh there is something called a service worker this is a web page on the network something really basic if you want to to see the the page you do an http get to to the network and something is coming in the in the browser well it's already here but the the document from the w3c is still in draft but it's already implemented in all the browsers basically you got your web page if you want to to access to the network there is something in the middle called service worker um it's not only a proxy some people resume a service worker as a proxy but it's it can do much more but the interesting part for from this point is what we can do with the service worker so i want to access to the network and the service worker say oh i saw this request maybe i can put it in the cache so then if you want to get it again you just need to call the cache and all of this is browser side when i saw this i say wow it's pretty cool because now i can do a lot of things in my in my application jake archibald wrote something called the offline cookbook and in this offline cookbook he gave us some some pattern from offline strategy this one is catch first you want to load a page so first you add to the to the cache if there is no nothing in the cache then you fall back on the network is another one it's the opposite it's network network first otherwise you're going the cache yeah for instance if i'm a shop and i want to show the product i can use this but maybe for a really sensitive data like the price or the availability maybe i want to to do something like network only so no way you don't put anything in the cache some more interesting the cache then network so look i asked in parallel to the cache and to the network the cache returned me the data and the on the same time i'm going on the on the network and after i can retrieve the data so while i'm navigating on the website the data so first at t0 i got the the data from the cache and after why i'm navigating the data are getting up to date something pretty similar it's my favorite it's style while revalidates um you always saw the the assets but from a t minus one uh from the last time you you were on the on the website it can be interesting for assets like javascript files css etc so first page the user so the so when the user go in your website it saw the the result from yesterday or for uh the last time you went to your website and etc but if you got a single page application maybe it doesn't make sense but if you don't have a single page application a website like facebook usually you don't do only one click you just you reload the page several times so on the first page you get the version from yesterday maybe but the page load instantly and on the second page you got the some uptodate data so i gave you some few strategies for offline there is much more in the in this website uh in this cookbook i recommend you to take a look and yeah you can also follow this guy jake archibald is a pretty good guy from from google now how does it work how does it work all of this or i can do that on my website this is some javascript code basically everything is based on promise but i don't know about you but sometimes it can be a bit annoying to to write very huge text use um huge cut code just to to manage my assets there is something called workbox workbox it's a pretty good tool uh sponsored by google by the way and basically it looks like this so on the first parameter of this function so so i define some routes and i say okay everything which look like a png gif etc on the image i want to apply a cache first strategy i can also put some fancy name like the the name of of the cache gonna be image uh you only store 60 or 60 image and for a duration of 30 days or if you want something way more simple you can do something like this here i want to store all the http calls from the github api and then i want to apply the network first strategy i'm sorry for you there is no uh you have to deal with regex so if you are not if like me you are not a big fan of regex it can be a small issue now let's switch to the 11 points single page application no i'm joking and hopefully there is a lot of people that say you have to be you have to build a single page application to do a progressive web apps it's wrong and it's something pretty cool because building and second page application is hard so no single page application so let's summarize this is my definition of a progressive web app it's just something really cool like this so you got a website on the privacy web app but it's not really professional so let's switch to to another definition from alex russell another guy from google which is working on progressive web apps it's a it said uh a pwa it's nothing else than a website which take the good vitamin what are this good vitamin so let's summarize it's something reliable so https you can get it even if you are offline also it's fast thanks to the service workers and you can get some engage you can better engage the your your customers with uh by installing the application getting some um what's the name notification etc another great tool to help you to build uh the best pwa it's lighthouse lighthouse you get it by default on chrome so i opened the dev tools here and you get a pan called audit and here you can click to perform an edit you select what you want so here let's select everything and um lighthouse will scroll your website check uh about performance how performance it is and 2g network so blah blah blah and after it will it will give you a report so here i'm probably gonna blame me for the for the performance because uh i got a lot of image and i did not fully optimize them and maybe also gonna complain for some stuff because i put some css in the html it's not really nice but it's not the the goal do i need to wait no i don't have time to wait so yeah you can see what it is doing and here i got my results here so i'm 64 compliant with progressive web app so there is problem because my application doesn't register a service worker i don't i probably break something here you can also get some the first meaningful paint this is really interesting even if you don't want to build a pwa you can get some good insight from your websites say okay i have to optimize this this to get a better seo something good with lighthouse you can also put it in cli so by using it cli it's mean you can use it in your in your pipeline ci cd etc another point really important it's speed matter i like this picture this is the team from red bull they are changing four tires in two seconds while the average page load on the 3g network is 19 seconds well 19 seconds it's really slow i don't know why well no we know basically it's because of the analytics nonoptimization etc and something you have to keep in mind about speed if half of the pers of the half of the people expect your website to load in less than two seconds and if your website load in more than three seconds yeah three seconds you lost fifty percent uh 50 percent will bounce so it can be something really nice if you want to to sell pwa in your in your company check the bounce rate but unfortunately today um there is things that we still cannot do in your in a progressive web app like i cannot access to nfc to the calendar to my contact list so we have to wait if you remember the the screen from uh the the screen i show you uh about what the web can do uh it's changing it's moving it's moving really fast so uh i discovered yesterday something called the no not yesterday but a few weeks ago something called um web payments api there is a lot of friction today in uh in your application if you want to sell something basically on my phone there is something pretty good is when i want to buy it's already linked to my google accounts it's pretty fast to buy something on uh on a mobile on a mobile app but on the web you have to take your wallet the credit card etc so yeah to avoid this friction they are developing this payment request api and i think i did this in some really few line of javascripts you can get something like this so here i give you a link if you want to buy an iphone for 10 euro it's look like this and i got something from the browser here and i got the detail of of my bills here i can put the my credit card and i just need to click on pay and that's it i don't need it so i will not pay it also unfortunately the user yet are not really used to this to this install button so i don't know maybe in few years people will use this but for now there is still a reflex to go on the on the store so they have to work on it if you check the the first version of the install button and what is it today it changed a lot so they are they're still trying to find the best way to engage user uh through this this button now the last part is about feedbacks some companies move to to prohibit web apps and they give feedback to the community the first one is twitter if you remember the map i saw you i show you in africa for instance there is no uh the network is pretty low um company like twitter want to keep this market and want to better reach these markets so they create something called twitter lit uh it's it's just twitter but uh you in http request you just take what you need to so the there is less less less more uh request i think the the full home page only took one way one megabits one megabyte to load uh it's much more for the other app um and yeah when they did this app after this they take some metrics and it's pretty interesting to see that because the app is better there is better performance on the with the browser etc so the user use more the applications 65 percent it's a lot so and also people people use more apps they tweet more and they come back more often the 20 also uh ford did something pretty similar they switched to pwa plus 100 engagements it's pretty good it's well it's awesome the user use more the application and yeah you got the the source it's also on developer.google.com it's a really good resource to switch to to pwa or to get some insight from company that switched to pwa so it's yeah the developer blog from google and also the the last one is uh what pinterest did pinterest for me it's the the most most important study from from them um so they say okay let's go to pwa and they realize that people stay more on the app they consume more they get more money because they are based on they use advertising fortunately unfortunately for us there is more engagements and after they also did something interesting and they compiled the the statistic from the native app and from the the web app and they realized that it's kind of the same so if you remember at the beginning i was showing you this diagram so today we're here it's in the same level it's not in the same level to be fairly honest but it's changing a lot there is a lot of improvement from the browser it's changing fast so maybe yesterday you didn't wanted a native app for some reason but now you can do it because your web apps can access to your positions your localization you can also buy on your mobile etc so keep an eye on keep an eye on this website what web can do today etc because yeah it's moving it's moving really fast thank you i think i got time for some questions no uh so your question is is it possible today to be in the in the application store application store you mean uh the android store and the ios one uh for now the answer is no um there is nothing already checked the only thing is plan is from the microsoft store to put pwa after i think there is a reason there is a reason why they didn't talk about it it's also because um um because you have to follow some rules mostly for the i think the ios for ios they scan or they scroll your your application et cetera and follow for a web app it's a bit harder to to check what's inside and so for me it's it's the reason after maybe it's gonna change i don't know any other questions so if it's the end the question if it's if it's the end of the native app well i don't have my crystal ball some people say native apps are dooms it was the the introduction i truly believe that today the progressive web app on in few few years they're gonna get challenged um does it still relevant today to build uh to build native apps yes for some companies it's they're making all of the the money here uh after i also saw some even some applications they were only on the on native apps and they switched also to web apps like um tinder they switched to pwa there is a nice blog still on google and they're giving some insight so people so people are switching to to this because there is a need i don't know if if it's gonna get replaced from my point of view yes but i'm pretty i'm not really good for prediction so uh yeah i also put if you check on the on the slide i put some uh some tools also there is one called pwa builder they help you to generate your money first there is a web webpagetest.org to measure the performance of your website yeah also oh yeah you were asking if it's still relevant the native apps it was on my backup slide this is the trend from uh from facebook so the world go on mobile so yes it's relevant to still building uh native apps but pwa for me it's also really interesting because the the mobile on the web it's still the same it doesn't decrease so yeah uh because basically native app has access ah okay yeah uh well i think you can so it's well here so your question is uh what's the website about your privacy right so if there's access to uh i think it's there yeah you got it in chrome settings so you can see here for instance uh your web app can access to your geo localization without asking you i was a bit scared when i saw this i say wow uh they can check a lot of things yeah so your gps localization they don't need to to ask you they can access it directly so here the notification by default ilo but you can also block them but the most important things to watch is what you can get by default so yeah here the camera well not here the location it's the default so they need to ask maybe it was on firefox it's by default i don't really remember so yeah after you you have to uh some stuff are blocks for some of them they allow by default so you have to keep an eye on it uh but yeah something good also with your native apps you know what what they need uh is that answer to your question there yeah i think it's okay for the time maybe a quick class question no it's okay okay thank you very much
