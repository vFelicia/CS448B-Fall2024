With timestamps:

00:07 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm jesse
00:10 - and
00:11 - the project that we've been working on
00:13 - for so long since at least january has
00:17 - finally launched
00:18 - uh so if you want to see the live
00:21 - version of the site it's at
00:23 - franciscan.edu which i'll type right now
00:25 - in the live chat
00:31 - so
00:33 - i'm gonna start out by telling you just
00:35 - a little bit about the launch and how
00:37 - things went
00:38 - and then we're gonna take a look at
00:41 - uh the trello board where i've been
00:43 - tracking
00:45 - you know everything really from all the
00:47 - extra features that i want to add
00:49 - and all the bugs that people have found
00:52 - and then i have found we're going to do
00:53 - a little triage all right which means
00:55 - we're going to
00:57 - figure out which
00:58 - things on the trello board which tasks
01:00 - are most important should be done first
01:03 - and then we're gonna try to get as many
01:04 - of those things done as we can
01:07 - in about an hour
01:09 - so i do have a meeting later on so we
01:12 - have a hard cap on how long this stream
01:14 - can go
01:16 - of course i will answer your questions
01:18 - as we go we'll use the pomodoro timer
01:20 - for those of you who are watching for
01:22 - the first time
01:23 - i am a
01:25 - full-time front-end developer for a
01:27 - small university we have just built
01:30 - the main website for the university live
01:33 - over the course of a long time
01:36 - and
01:38 - you're getting a glimpse of my
01:39 - day-to-day work i don't rehearse this uh
01:42 - this is what i'm actually doing uh for a
01:44 - living and so i will make mistakes
01:48 - and please call me out on it
01:51 - and i'll do my best to explain what i'm
01:53 - doing as i go along it's not really a
01:55 - tutorial though so don't feel bad if you
01:57 - get lost just you know ask questions uh
02:00 - it's totally fine
02:04 - let's see
02:05 - hey see a lot of people saying hi hey
02:08 - good to see you hey horchat's here good
02:09 - to see you
02:11 - um
02:14 - all right
02:19 - let me
02:22 - all right let me first
02:25 - just take i'm going to set a timer too
02:28 - i'm just going to take a few minutes
02:31 - and i'm going to tell you about how the
02:32 - launch went since i didn't stream it
02:35 - because it's a little bit crazy
02:37 - so
02:38 - basically this is how things went down
02:40 - last week
02:42 - at some point
02:44 - last week or the week before it was
02:45 - decided that we would try to launch on
02:47 - wednesday okay i was asked to give the
02:50 - earliest possible time that i thought we
02:51 - could launch and i said okay wednesday
02:53 - is good i knew i wouldn't be ready by
02:55 - monday
02:56 - um and i wanted to give myself a little
02:59 - buffer in case something went wrong so i
03:01 - said okay let's take tuesday and
03:03 - wednesday it is
03:05 - definitely didn't want to launch on a
03:06 - friday because things go wrong on a
03:08 - weekend then i have to go to work
03:10 - so
03:11 - wednesday we go for launch there was
03:13 - some issues uh where
03:15 - we had to verify that we own the domain
03:19 - with google but there were some issues
03:21 - with the it department and they were
03:23 - wondering to know well
03:25 - would
03:26 - how would the verification affect
03:30 - g suite and would that somehow give the
03:33 - website
03:34 - access to some g suite stuff so
03:37 - once we got all that sorted out on
03:39 - thursday
03:40 - i came into work
03:42 - and i went over with the the people in
03:45 - it we sat down we changed all the
03:48 - uh dns information and then over the
03:50 - course of that day
03:52 - slowly we saw
03:53 - uh the
03:55 - um all the dns stuff get updated because
03:57 - sometimes it takes a while got it all
03:59 - updated got everything running on google
04:02 - app engine
04:03 - and
04:04 - the site started to work
04:06 - and i started to get
04:08 - messages from people saying hey i found
04:11 - this link then it doesn't work
04:13 - or where's this piece of content i can't
04:15 - find it so it wasn't really that bad uh
04:18 - to be honest with you it was
04:19 - the response was
04:21 - uh overall like positive nobody
04:24 - nobody
04:25 - came talked to me directly or anything
04:27 - and said they don't like the website we
04:29 - did have some students well one student
04:31 - on facebook
04:32 - maybe a few students on facebook said
04:34 - that they didn't like certain parts of
04:35 - the site
04:36 - otherwise though
04:38 - not too bad
04:40 - um so overall really happy there were
04:44 - several people who actually came up to
04:46 - me that day and said congratulations and
04:48 - they love the site so that was really
04:50 - cool
04:51 - um
04:52 - no like major issues the site didn't
04:54 - crash
04:55 - nothing crazy like that just as some
04:58 - broken links and things so that's what
05:00 - mostly what i've been going
05:02 - through
05:03 - the only weird issue that i have that i
05:04 - haven't been able to figure out is that
05:06 - occasionally when i deployed a google
05:08 - app engine uh the build
05:10 - just the weird things break so the logos
05:13 - won't show up
05:15 - or certain pages
05:17 - uh will just cause an error
05:19 - and then if i just rebuild and redeploy
05:21 - it works
05:23 - um
05:24 - so what i'm done in instead and if
05:27 - anybody's interested i can show you how
05:28 - we've done this with app engine is i set
05:31 - up some some scripts in my pack
05:33 - package json to
05:35 - do a test build and deploy or it will
05:37 - deploy an instance to
05:40 - google app engine but it won't
05:43 - point the domain to that instance so i
05:46 - can go to just that custom url which it
05:50 - would it shows me whenever the build and
05:52 - deployment succeeds make sure everything
05:54 - works first and then do a real deploy
05:57 - with that same build
05:58 - okay so that's my deployment step now
06:00 - which is to be honest with you that's
06:02 - how it should be done i think that way
06:04 - there's this in-between step of you know
06:06 - your development environment is local
06:08 - and then there's this test environment
06:10 - and then production so that's the flow
06:12 - now
06:13 - it was actually pretty simple once i
06:15 - found the documentation to figure out
06:16 - how to do that so i can i can show you
06:18 - that in a second but basically
06:21 - that's how everything went
06:23 - uh not too bad the only stressful thing
06:26 - is just trying to figure out what to do
06:28 - first because a lot of times i'll have
06:30 - multiple people messaging me and talking
06:32 - to me about we want this done or that
06:34 - done
06:35 - and uh just trying to like handle all
06:37 - those things coming in while i'm working
06:38 - on other things
06:40 - uh is
06:42 - not overwhelming but it's just
06:44 - you know um
06:45 - challenging right
06:47 - okay i see a lot of people saying hi i
06:49 - just want to say hey everybody i'm going
06:51 - to set a 25 minute timer at the end of
06:53 - that timer i'm going to go to the live
06:55 - chat and i'm going to answer your
06:56 - questions and and check out what you've
06:57 - been saying so
06:59 - um
07:00 - i see yeah somebody's
07:04 - son keeps saying hi a lot so i'm just
07:07 - going to say hi to you
07:09 - since you're really excited about that
07:10 - okay
07:12 - um
07:14 - let's see
07:17 - all right timer is set i'm going to
07:19 - share my screen now
07:21 - and
07:24 - let me show you first i'm going to show
07:25 - you that script since i just talked
07:27 - about it i'm going to show it to you
07:30 - i don't know if this would apply to
07:31 - anybody if you're not using
07:36 - google app engine
07:39 - i'd like to go through maybe on a stream
07:41 - one day or on a recorded video and kind
07:43 - of show you the flow of how everything's
07:45 - set up like a big overview
07:47 - uh but
07:48 - for now uh this is what i've done
07:50 - hopefully you can see that let me know
07:51 - if it's too small
07:53 - for now uh we have
07:57 - are
07:58 - our test
07:59 - deploy
08:00 - which actually runs the build first
08:03 - so it does our build step which is just
08:05 - next build right
08:07 - and then
08:09 - it does a
08:11 - oops here's your test deploy it does a
08:12 - gcloud app deploy with a no promote flag
08:16 - okay so that means it's not going to
08:18 - automatically point the url to the
08:20 - latest version which it normally would
08:22 - do
08:23 - right so the step would then be do this
08:26 - go to the url that it tells me it's it's
08:29 - launched this instance to
08:30 - make sure that it works and then
08:33 - i can run deploy
08:35 - right which is a g cloud app deploy if
08:36 - for some reason i needed to just do
08:38 - things really fast maybe an emergency
08:40 - change i could just run a build deploy
08:43 - which would build and deploy
08:45 - right to the live version immediately
08:47 - this is what i was doing at first
08:50 - and it didn't always work out so it
08:52 - wasn't like catastrophic but
08:54 - you know there was a time where i
08:55 - deployed something before i came into
08:57 - work when i was still at home and didn't
08:59 - realize that a certain section of the
09:01 - site wasn't working anymore
09:04 - and then when i got to work
09:06 - i realized it you know but there was i
09:09 - don't know maybe
09:10 - around an hour of time
09:12 - that a section of the site wasn't
09:13 - working so
09:15 - i'm definitely going to stick with this
09:17 - now
09:18 - and just hit those sections of the site
09:19 - that i know have been affected so mainly
09:22 - some things on the homepage and things
09:23 - on faculty list pages
09:26 - those are the only areas that i know
09:27 - have been affected so far
09:30 - uh okay
09:33 - all right so now let me show you
09:37 - our trello board
09:40 - and this will be the last thing we do
09:41 - before we actually get started so
09:44 - i'm going to try to zoom in and show you
09:45 - this is what i was working on right
09:47 - before i started the stream so i just
09:48 - finished the pomodoro session with this
09:51 - and um
09:53 - i'm just working on
09:54 - a a student here
09:57 - ran some some scans and found a bunch of
09:59 - links and stuff super helpful
10:02 - and i forwarded me all the info
10:05 - so i grabbed it all and just made a
10:07 - checklist of it and i'm just going
10:08 - through and checking some of these
10:10 - broken links
10:12 - a lot of them i had already fixed by
10:14 - fixing like previous issues so
10:17 - right now it's just a matter of checking
10:18 - these links
10:20 - making sure they work now and then
10:22 - checking them off so i'm almost through
10:23 - that one
10:24 - uh i don't know that that'll be that
10:26 - exciting for a stream or informative so
10:28 - let's check out some of the other things
10:30 - we have i mainly want to look at these
10:31 - two areas because i've already sorted
10:34 - through what i think are really
10:35 - important things and put them in here
10:38 - so we're just going to look at the ones
10:40 - that are assigned to me so they have my
10:41 - little my image right there
10:43 - we just looked at these links so the in
10:46 - progress column is going to be the most
10:47 - important things right now
10:49 - um make edits to grad education pages
10:52 - let's check out what's in here i don't
10:53 - even remember this
10:55 - uh looks like they're broken links got
10:57 - education okay you know what these edits
11:01 - i got these from um someone else that
11:04 - that works here at the university
11:05 - earlier today
11:07 - a lot of these are just uh text edits so
11:10 - that's not it's not really going to
11:11 - involve coding so we're gonna skip that
11:14 - for now
11:15 - uh this testing i've mainly been having
11:18 - my one of my student workers work on
11:20 - this and now there's there's a large
11:23 - list of things that need work done
11:25 - that might be a decent candidate
11:28 - uh let's see
11:30 - i do want to research using algolia for
11:32 - the search because i'm not satisfied
11:34 - with the way the search results are
11:35 - coming in right now
11:37 - so if anybody has experience with
11:39 - algolia
11:41 - let me know what you think of it
11:43 - uh
11:44 - if if you had a good experience bad
11:46 - experience if you have any advice for
11:47 - the best way to go about doing that
11:49 - please let me know
11:51 - i think it's worth it
11:53 - algolia is a paid service
11:55 - uh if you want to be able to use all the
11:57 - features
11:58 - wow i have a lot of viewers right now
12:00 - hey everybody
12:01 - uh
12:02 - please if anybody's a new viewer you're
12:04 - not sure what's going on please feel
12:06 - free to ask questions i may not get to
12:07 - it for a little while i'm running this
12:09 - timer but i imagine there's probably a
12:11 - lot of first time viewers right now uh
12:14 - so in about 20 minutes i'm going to do a
12:16 - little question and answer session so if
12:18 - you can stick around till then i'll
12:19 - answer any questions that you have
12:21 - okay so i'd rather not do research on
12:24 - the stream so that's probably out uh
12:26 - let's see just like search urls add new
12:29 - draw links all right you know what
12:32 - these
12:33 - are all not that exciting
12:35 - so
12:37 - here's what we'll do let me let me go
12:39 - through this really quick oops not this
12:41 - one
12:43 - this stuff and let's see if there'd be
12:44 - something a little bit more exciting in
12:45 - here
12:48 - when you go to the search tab without
12:50 - searching anything the top search option
12:53 - is unclickable
13:00 - all right let's check that out that's
13:02 - kind of a weird thing i'm not really
13:03 - sure what it means alright so my student
13:06 - worker reported this bug let's check out
13:08 - what the bug is and let's see uh if we
13:11 - can fix it right
13:13 - so let me
13:16 - i'm gonna start up my
13:17 - oh no
13:20 - there we go i'm going to start up ngrok
13:22 - uh this is going to let you check out
13:24 - the site as we're working on it
13:27 - you can see the site live now if you
13:29 - want but
13:30 - also you can click on the link i just
13:32 - pasted in there if it doesn't work when
13:33 - you click it copy and paste it in your
13:35 - browser and that should work
13:37 - but you'll be able to click around on
13:38 - the site inspect it with your dev tools
13:40 - you know whatever you want
13:43 - i'm gonna go to well first let's go to
13:45 - the site
13:46 - so i'm going to go to the local host
13:48 - version
13:49 - and see if we can replicate it here if
13:51 - not we'll go to the live version so
13:54 - let's go to the search page
13:59 - i'm not actually even sure how the my
14:02 - student worker got to the search page
14:03 - without clicking on a search but uh
14:05 - regardless okay so we're on the search
14:07 - page we haven't searched for anything
14:10 - and now let's try to click this
14:12 - um
14:17 - okay
14:18 - all right so this seems to be the issue
14:20 - that if you try to use the top search
14:22 - bar when you're on the search page
14:25 - a search does not occur
14:28 - okay
14:31 - what if
14:35 - all right let me share with you the
14:37 - couple of solutions that are going
14:38 - through my head right now
14:40 - okay um
14:46 - number one we could just take away the
14:49 - search option in the top
14:51 - if we're on the search page
14:53 - that's an option there's really no need
14:56 - to have more than one search on the
14:57 - search page you know what else i'm also
14:59 - going to assume that the search on the
15:00 - side here doesn't work let's check that
15:03 - out
15:10 - and that is the case okay so neither
15:12 - search option works on the search page
15:15 - so um we could try to get them to work
15:18 - or we could remove them now that there's
15:20 - two of them to remove
15:22 - i don't know if i want to remove two
15:23 - that might actually be more work than
15:25 - just fixing this
15:26 - so
15:28 - let's look into the code and see why
15:31 - this isn't working
15:32 - i think
15:34 - the reason is going to be because
15:38 - the the way these work depends on a
15:41 - route change
15:43 - and since no route change is happening
15:45 - right because we're already on the
15:46 - search page
15:49 - that's that's why this isn't working but
15:51 - uh there is something i actually wanted
15:54 - to implement so i'm kind of glad this
15:55 - came up i want to implement it so that
15:58 - the search will look here
16:01 - at the address bar you might not be able
16:02 - to see it uh small
16:04 - but it'll look at the search query here
16:06 - and automatically search so that if a
16:08 - person
16:09 - bookmarked a search they could come back
16:12 - and see the same search now all this may
16:15 - not even matter if we go with algolia
16:17 - but
16:21 - for now i don't know how soon we're
16:23 - gonna go with algolia if at all so i
16:25 - think it might be worth it to implement
16:27 - this
16:30 - let's see
16:33 - so we need to check out our search page
16:39 - and you know what let's see
16:41 - let's see where that card is for the
16:43 - search
16:45 - because i do i believe i had it on here
16:47 - let's look over
16:48 - here wow let me let me do it
16:52 - let's do a search for this
16:54 - uh
16:55 - add search euros test search page
17:01 - autofocus fix up so
17:06 - did i not do this
17:10 - hmm
17:19 - all right i'm not gonna keep looking for
17:20 - that i thought i already had a card for
17:22 - that i guess not it's possible i just
17:24 - made a github issue for it instead
17:27 - uh but i'm not gonna do that uh let's
17:30 - see
17:31 - i'm gonna i'm getting some feedback from
17:33 - you all about this so i'm just gonna go
17:35 - to the live chat now
17:36 - uh john hanson says the side search menu
17:39 - will fail for search term
17:42 - if if the search page route is there
17:46 - uh michael creole says why not make this
17:48 - search bar component so that no matter
17:50 - where it is it acts the same
17:58 - um that's not a bad idea
18:02 - i don't know if we'll do that right now
18:04 - uh i don't know if i'll have time for to
18:06 - do that
18:08 - but that's actually not a bad idea
18:12 - um first thing let's go to our search
18:15 - page and see what we have going on
18:18 - see how difficult this is gonna be uh to
18:20 - do
18:26 - okay
18:30 - all right so on our search page
18:37 - let's see
18:38 - our search term
18:41 - it's probably going to determine what we
18:43 - search right so
18:45 - we'll most likely need to
18:48 - grab what's in the url
18:50 - and put it into our state under search
18:52 - term
18:54 - so let's see
18:56 - uh
18:57 - component did mount
18:59 - create base search
19:05 - looks like we're already doing some
19:06 - things with search and we're already
19:09 - getting
19:10 - a new location search but are we already
19:12 - getting the search term
19:15 - interesting
19:19 - oh you know what
19:25 - i think i know what the problem is so
19:28 - this happens when a component did mount
19:30 - right
19:31 - um when we're here on the page already
19:34 - uh this this page component is already
19:37 - mounted so when we change this it
19:41 - doesn't change the state of that
19:42 - component so that component doesn't
19:45 - re-render we we don't get
19:48 - this doesn't run again
19:51 - so that's our problem right now
20:00 - hmm
20:05 - all right
20:10 - this is going to be
20:19 - it's going to be a little bit more
20:20 - difficult than i had hoped uh mostly
20:23 - because
20:24 - of where these components all live
20:26 - right uh right now like the easiest way
20:29 - to do this would just be to
20:33 - i don't know call
20:34 - call some of these functions
20:37 - whenever we change um
20:39 - the
20:40 - search components right on the side
20:42 - drawer and on the app bar
20:45 - but unfortunately
20:51 - these aren't shared so i'm gonna look
20:52 - harsh it's saying you could use
20:57 - to get snapshot before update or get
20:59 - derived state from props
21:13 - okay you know what i just got who said
21:15 - it michael creole says there's a
21:16 - learning experience i've been playing
21:18 - around with search trying to make it
21:19 - work with graphql still can't figure it
21:21 - out uh that actually gave me an idea
21:23 - what if
21:28 - all right let me talk through this you
21:29 - all let me know what you think what if
21:31 - we
21:32 - stored the search term
21:38 - in
21:39 - um
21:42 - i can't remember what it's called an
21:43 - apollo like like a universal store right
21:46 - for for the entire application so
21:49 - um
21:50 - i don't think we've done that yet with
21:51 - apollo though
21:55 - but potentially
22:01 - i think that could work
22:04 - uh let's see has anybody used that with
22:07 - basically um
22:09 - you use the capabilities that apollo has
22:11 - that act kind of like redux right
22:17 - john hanson says local storage yeah i
22:19 - mean not exactly local storage
22:21 - we could use local storage but i was
22:24 - thinking more of um
22:26 - what apollo has let's double check
22:29 - really quick um
22:33 - apollo
22:36 - let's go to apollo graphql to their docs
22:41 - and
22:44 - react
22:52 - there we go
22:53 - local state management
22:56 - link state that's what it's called
23:06 - oh harshit says since it happens on
23:08 - route change use nexjs route listeners
23:12 - okay i like that idea
23:18 - let's check this out
23:20 - multiple releases
23:31 - i just want to go to the github page
23:37 - there we go
23:39 - if you go to the next github page you
23:41 - can just do a control fine
23:45 - no event
23:48 - or i'm what was it route listeners say
23:51 - route
23:56 - well at least we have the route
23:59 - if you don't want to listen here we are
24:01 - here's how to properly listen for router
24:02 - event and around change
24:06 - router events on
24:28 - all right cool let's try to listen to
24:30 - this then
24:33 - and do we need to import yeah we'll
24:35 - probably need to import router so let's
24:37 - grab that first
24:39 - let's import router
24:43 - if i'm not already yeah i'm not already
24:45 - doing it so we're going to import router
24:46 - from next router let me zoom in a little
24:49 - bit
24:50 - so the idea here is if we could just use
24:53 - this to listen for a route change we can
24:55 - trigger what was already happening on
24:58 - componentdid mount but instead we're
25:00 - going to trigger the same thing on a
25:01 - route change
25:08 - okay
25:11 - so let's just copy what they have here
25:17 - all right so the way this will go is on
25:19 - the route change it's just going to call
25:21 - whatever function we give it
25:24 - and in this case it's handled route
25:26 - change but for in in our case we're
25:29 - probably just going to call something we
25:30 - already have
25:31 - so
25:33 - i'm going to put this
25:35 - i'm not sure where
25:38 - we need to put
25:40 - this let me double check
25:43 - where's this thing put this
25:54 - i guess we can put it right out here
25:56 - with with the rest of it
25:58 - i'm gonna try to put it closer to the
26:00 - component it's gonna call
26:02 - so hopefully it'll make more sense
26:04 - so let's put it up here
26:10 - router
26:14 - i thought we're importing router right
26:16 - i'm using it
26:30 - put it in component did mount all right
26:32 - so harsh it's saying put it in
26:35 - component did mount oh what did i just
26:37 - do
26:41 - there we go
26:53 - i think i accidentally copied the wrong
26:56 - thing
26:58 - all right let's try it again
27:00 - okay we'll put it in component did mount
27:02 - okay so that'll fire this off one
27:05 - component did mount and then we'll call
27:09 - um we can pass component amount to it
27:12 - interesting okay
27:14 - um
27:23 - okay
27:32 - i don't think i've ever tried to call
27:33 - component did mount
27:35 - this is gonna be interesting
27:38 - let's see if it works
27:40 - all right
27:43 - where are we at
27:47 - no property on of undefined
27:54 - router events
27:57 - hmm
28:00 - that's odd right because we this is
28:03 - exactly how it has it here
28:14 - i wonder if they have an example that we
28:17 - can look at usually
28:20 - they have examples
28:21 - um
28:32 - uh let's
28:33 - check out these examples
28:45 - i want that let's go to our pages
28:49 - uh let's see the index page maybe it'll
28:51 - have it on here nope
28:55 - uh
28:55 - let's try here
29:01 - no i just want to know where they have
29:03 - the router
29:05 - touch it there we are they use the next
29:07 - router here okay so they just have
29:10 - router events here
29:14 - okay all right let's just let's make a
29:16 - little switch here
29:18 - let's take it out of here
29:22 - and
29:24 - we'll put it up here and then
29:27 - let's do this because i kind of i like
29:31 - i kind of like this um
29:34 - we'll pass in
29:38 - url
29:42 - yeah let's just pull this whole thing
29:44 - for now
29:47 - so like how they're doing this
29:52 - so we're going to pass in i guess we
29:54 - don't really need to pass in the url
29:56 - right
29:57 - [Music]
29:59 - but we do need to
30:04 - i do want to call multiple things so
30:07 - we would call
30:08 - i guess these three
30:17 - and why
30:19 - again we have the weird squiggly line on
30:21 - router
30:25 - unless
30:28 - i see
30:31 - this needs to go outside of here
30:36 - there we go
30:42 - i'm not sure though if i'm going to be
30:43 - able to call these functions from
30:45 - outside here
30:47 - let's see what error we get
30:52 - still getting that same on air
31:03 - uh you know what harsh is saying maybe i
31:08 - need to update next js
31:15 - you know what you're right i think i'm
31:17 - not using the latest version
31:29 - all right let's see how much time we
31:30 - have oh okay almost time for question
31:33 - and answer so
31:36 - we'll do some questions and answers and
31:38 - then we'll decide whether or not we're
31:40 - going to try to update next js
31:43 - right now
31:45 - definitely going to make another branch
31:46 - let's do that right now get check out
31:50 - the
31:51 - um
31:55 - search
31:58 - update
31:59 - so i'm going to get checkout with a b
32:01 - flag so that will make a new branch and
32:03 - check out that new branch at the same
32:05 - time i'm going to call it search update
32:07 - okay that way uh anything we do now will
32:10 - not mess up our main master branch
32:14 - okay
32:16 - let's i'm gonna do a five minute timer
32:20 - and answer some questions so i'm gonna
32:21 - scroll up to the top try to get through
32:23 - as many questions as i can in this five
32:25 - minutes and then we'll do go back and do
32:27 - some coding
32:28 - okay
32:32 - uh
32:33 - someone's interested in python
32:34 - programming uh i personally don't do any
32:37 - python uh not on the stream or anything
32:39 - but there are definitely some other
32:41 - videos on uh this channel where i use
32:44 - all different types of programming
32:46 - languages so maybe just do a little
32:48 - search for python inside the free code
32:50 - camp channel and you know you'll
32:51 - probably find something
32:54 - let's see
33:00 - okay
33:01 - see a lot of you saying hi i'm not going
33:03 - to say all your names individually sorry
33:04 - but i
33:06 - just want to make sure we have enough
33:08 - time to get something done in this
33:09 - stream
33:11 - um
33:12 - love neet says is react good enough for
33:15 - a job uh yeah for sure there are a ton
33:17 - of react jobs out there
33:19 - i see uh reacting job listings
33:22 - all the time like almost every day i see
33:26 - a job listing for react i get them like
33:28 - sent to my email and on linkedin and
33:30 - everything so i see them all the time
33:38 - uh karante says much appreciated for the
33:40 - stream
33:42 - um thanks i i'm glad you said that
33:45 - always love to hear that um the stream
33:48 - is of value uh to you all
33:50 - um steven says howdy long time viewer
33:52 - first time poster oh awesome well thanks
33:54 - for watching and uh thanks for letting
33:56 - me know you're out there
34:00 - uh mike asks if i had have discord i do
34:03 - have
34:04 - discord my name is probably jesse weigle
34:07 - on discord
34:09 - it's pretty much the same everywhere
34:11 - um moosh mooshfeek says do you use php
34:17 - in front-end development do you have to
34:18 - use php in front of development no not
34:20 - at all php is not a front end
34:23 - thing
34:24 - if you want to do wordpress development
34:27 - it might not hurt to know some php but
34:29 - otherwise
34:31 - i really don't
34:32 - do much php at all
34:35 - andrew says hey if you're still in the
34:37 - market for a new keyboard i would
34:38 - recommend something mechanical if you
34:40 - give me a budget i could try to point
34:41 - you in the right direction okay cool so
34:44 - for those of you who follow me on
34:45 - instagram you might already know this
34:46 - but i'm looking for suggestions for
34:48 - keyboards i have a new setup at home
34:51 - that i'm working on and i'm gonna maybe
34:53 - i'll show you all my new setup on
34:56 - instagram
34:57 - uh if you want to follow me on there
34:59 - it's uh jesse.weigle i think is my name
35:02 - but
35:03 - um
35:05 - i have this old keyboard i really don't
35:07 - like how it feels so i'm looking for
35:08 - suggestions my budget right now is like
35:12 - i don't want to spend a lot on a
35:13 - keyboard i've never used a mechanical
35:14 - one so i'd like to get kind of like a
35:16 - lower priced keyboard um
35:20 - i don't know like for sure under 100
35:23 - uh for a keyboard
35:25 - you know maybe like around 50 would be
35:27 - even better
35:28 - i know that's not a lot for mechanical
35:30 - keyboard but i don't want to invest a
35:31 - lot into one until i really get the
35:33 - experience of typing on one and get a
35:35 - feel for what i like and don't like
35:37 - about them
35:44 - uh
35:45 - let's see
35:52 - uh did
35:55 - um
35:56 - jamal
35:57 - i'm sorry i'm not sure how to pronounce
35:58 - that it's dg
36:00 - d j a m a l says are you contributing to
36:02 - react no i have not contributed to the
36:05 - you know react code base but it'd be
36:08 - awesome to do so i just don't have the
36:10 - time right now
36:11 - but i'd love to at some point since i've
36:14 - used react for so much it'd be great to
36:15 - give back
36:22 - uh love needs says how
36:24 - will i become like you as a react coder
36:27 - um
36:28 - i just just practice
36:30 - and um
36:31 - try to be better than me right um
36:34 - uh i'm not sure that i'm like any type
36:37 - of goal to aspire to but uh yeah just
36:40 - practice read documentation build things
36:43 - with react uh don't be afraid to just
36:45 - build things and don't worry so much is
36:47 - like is this the right way to do it just
36:49 - build uh you'll get better you can
36:51 - always go back and refactor things
36:54 - but the most important thing to get
36:55 - better at coding is is to code
36:59 - code and try to improve uh every every
37:02 - time you build something new try to
37:04 - expand what you can do and build more
37:06 - hey all right looks like i'm not going
37:09 - to get through all the questions right
37:10 - now
37:11 - but i will definitely try to get through
37:14 - them
37:15 - on my
37:17 - after we do a little bit more coding
37:19 - um let me see i'm going to write down
37:22 - where i leave off
37:24 - so i don't miss anyone's questions
37:26 - here's what we're going to do
37:28 - i'm going to start this timer for
37:29 - another pomodoro session but if we get
37:31 - finished before it ends i'm just going
37:32 - to go write the question so we have more
37:34 - time for questions okay um i think
37:38 - especially since we just made a new
37:40 - branch i'm gonna try to update next
37:42 - uh
37:43 - on on the air so i'm gonna go through
37:44 - all the steps that i normally do when i
37:46 - update like a major package that i'm
37:48 - using so first let's go to next
37:52 - and i'm gonna go up here to
37:54 - releases
37:56 - and let's find out
37:59 - which release area so we're gonna go to
38:02 - latest release so i'm not going to
38:03 - update to one of these canary releases
38:05 - they have all the latest features but
38:07 - they also have more bugs than a stable
38:09 - release so i'm going to go to latest
38:11 - release 6.1.2
38:13 - and we're going to check out
38:16 - any release notes okay and it looks like
38:21 - there's not see like normally we would
38:23 - see they would say breaking changes here
38:27 - and there's no breaking changes so i
38:30 - think we're good to go
38:33 - and it'll tell you usually we could
38:36 - scroll down on most packages
38:38 - is it gonna say it
38:41 - usually it'll say what to type into
38:46 - to use this
38:47 - and actually hmm
38:49 - let's go to the docs just to see if we
38:52 - have
38:55 - this
38:57 - this ability
38:59 - and the latest stable release
39:09 - there we go okay so we we can listen for
39:12 - router events
39:13 - with the latest release
39:15 - on route change start
39:19 - oh you know what
39:21 - it has a different syntax
39:26 - okay
39:27 - you know what let's just try this now
39:29 - i still want to update next but let's
39:31 - see if this syntax works
39:33 - and
39:35 - if it does at least we'll have it
39:37 - working and then we can update next if
39:39 - we want to
39:43 - okay
39:48 - so
39:51 - i yeah we still need to import router
39:53 - but now instead of router events on
39:55 - we're going to go on route change start
39:58 - and
39:59 - we'll just copy and paste this stuff in
40:01 - here
40:05 - get rid of this one
40:07 - and see if this works now
40:10 - we'll go back to
40:13 - okay we didn't get an error this time
40:15 - which is nice
40:18 - and
40:20 - all right that was a good sign because
40:23 - it looked like it used what was up here
40:25 - and it automatically searched so let's
40:27 - let's change this um
40:33 - that was nice okay that
40:35 - that searching based on a url change
40:38 - which is awesome now here's the next
40:40 - test
40:41 - we'll go back and do a search for the
40:44 - okay and that didn't work
40:46 - so
40:47 - this is still not working it did update
40:50 - this but it updated it in in a way that
40:55 - didn't trigger
40:57 - oh
40:58 - accidentally clicked that
41:00 - so it didn't trigger that
41:03 - on route change start
41:05 - so
41:08 - let's look at how we're we're pushing
41:10 - that route uh so let's let's go to the
41:13 - drawer component since we we have it
41:15 - open already
41:16 - and let me see if i can find search
41:24 - i guess i could have searched for
41:26 - something better okay
41:28 - here's
41:30 - okay so we do a handle search
41:36 - let's look for that
41:40 - handle search
41:42 - okay so we're doing router push
41:46 - path name
41:50 - so we're doing a push
41:58 - so let's look at the routes and see if
42:00 - we could do this part in a different way
42:04 - so that it would cause
42:07 - cause the event to get registered right
42:10 - so as it gets picked up so we're gonna
42:12 - go back to our documentation
42:15 - and i guess we'll use this documentation
42:18 - although
42:19 - i really wish there were a dark theme
42:21 - for this you know
42:24 - it's killing my eyes
42:25 - uh
42:28 - routing okay
42:31 - routing
42:32 - with link that's not what we want to do
42:38 - not what we want to do
42:42 - where yet
42:45 - there we are so you want to use this
42:46 - router push
42:48 - that's right you may wish to listen to
42:50 - pop state react for the router does
42:54 - it print some forces or something
42:56 - refresh we could use
43:12 - push and replace a url
43:18 - all right i'm going to double check the
43:19 - chat to see if you all have have typed
43:21 - in some advice
43:27 - okay harsh it's saying
43:33 - yarn upgrade interactive latest might
43:36 - give you a heart attack after seeing how
43:37 - many packages are out of date i know i
43:40 - haven't updated any packages for
43:42 - two or three weeks because i knew launch
43:44 - was coming so i didn't want to break
43:45 - anything too bad before launch
43:48 - um
43:49 - but i do want to start getting things
43:50 - updated now because i don't like to go
43:52 - too long without updating
43:55 - okay
43:56 - let's see
44:07 - all right i don't see anything
44:10 - so let's just keep on going with this
44:14 - push in place
44:23 - props you're a push
44:27 - okay so maybe
44:44 - on before he's viruses for changing the
44:46 - browser's history
44:48 - well let's see if we're changing the
44:50 - browser history actually
44:51 - we are okay let's let's try this then
44:55 - uh let's try to listen for a change in
44:58 - browser history
45:00 - where am i at i can get rid of these two
45:23 - yeah i mean we could try to listen for
45:24 - this
45:27 - i i don't i don't really know if it's
45:28 - gonna work but it's worth a shot
45:34 - and it means we don't have to change
45:36 - that much
45:44 - okay
45:48 - all right so let's see this now
45:51 - let's um
45:58 - hmm
46:01 - okay
46:02 - so that didn't work either let me
46:06 - i'm gonna refresh just to be sure that i
46:08 - picked up that change although i'm
46:09 - pretty sure it did
46:20 - okay yeah so that's not picking it up
46:21 - either uh the history
46:27 - see
46:34 - okay
46:41 - all right what we could do
46:49 - we could force
46:54 - we could force a change
47:05 - so
47:05 - if we didn't use the router and we just
47:08 - used the normal like browser api we
47:11 - could potentially force a change right
47:16 - um
47:19 - we could try it let's see how much time
47:21 - we have
47:28 - all right so we could try to try that or
47:30 - we could try upgrading to the next
47:33 - version of next
47:34 - and
47:36 - see if we then could use
47:39 - some of the newer stuff actually you
47:40 - know we couldn't right so the
47:42 - documentation we read at first on github
47:44 - was for the canary release
47:46 - this documentation is for the latest
47:48 - release which is what we would be
47:50 - upgrading to so this is what we would be
47:52 - using so
47:55 - if we wanted to use the latest stuff
47:58 - we'd have to wait until that actually
47:59 - came into the latest stable release
48:02 - so
48:03 - here's what i want to try this will be
48:05 - the last thing i try
48:06 - uh before we do some questions because i
48:09 - don't wanna i don't wanna go too long
48:11 - with the coding and not be able to
48:12 - answer your questions
48:14 - okay
48:16 - so we're gonna go to
48:18 - we'll go to the drawer component for now
48:20 - and instead of using router push
48:25 - let's
48:29 - if the state search
48:31 - let's comment this out for now
48:35 - and instead let's do
48:42 - window
48:45 - dots
48:50 - location
48:54 - i'm doing this for memory let's see if
48:56 - this works i equals
49:06 - search
49:09 - search equals
49:20 - okay
49:21 - so here's what i'm doing uh i'm going to
49:23 - use the browsers api to change the
49:26 - window location
49:28 - and see if that'll trigger anything
49:31 - i'm going for memory here so i don't
49:32 - even know if this is the right way to
49:34 - say it
49:37 - um
49:39 - let's see
49:41 - search
49:42 - okay so i'm just using a template
49:44 - literal so that i can put javascript in
49:46 - the middle of this and grab this state
49:48 - so let's save that
49:50 - see if we get an error or anything
49:53 - okay nothing right off the bat we'll let
49:55 - this do its thing and then we'll try to
49:56 - search from that side drawer there which
49:58 - is what we just changed
50:02 - nice
50:04 - that worked alright cool i do want to
50:07 - verify that that changed the browser
50:08 - history it does awesome
50:11 - so now let's just take what we just did
50:13 - there
50:14 - and
50:15 - we can get rid of that and we'll just
50:18 - take this and use it
50:22 - in our app bar component
50:26 - so let's find our app bar
50:28 - and find the search there
50:30 - see if we have handle search here as
50:32 - well we do
50:34 - so we're going to remove this router
50:37 - push
50:38 - and put that in there
50:40 - we're going to save it
50:42 - and now
50:46 - oh
50:47 - try it
50:49 - yay it works all right cool
50:54 - let's also verify that this still works
51:02 - okay
51:03 - uh the one thing i would want to do and
51:05 - i don't know if we'll have time today to
51:06 - do that but you can see i just searched
51:09 - for biology here and i did get the
51:11 - biology results but it didn't change in
51:13 - the url it still has the url for the
51:16 - other
51:17 - uh type of search so what i would want
51:19 - to do then is make it so that when a
51:22 - search happens here it does actually
51:24 - change the url
51:26 - so actually you know what we can do for
51:28 - that
51:29 - let's do this router push
51:34 - okay we're going to do the router push
51:36 - but we're going to put it in the search
51:38 - so that when this happens
51:42 - um
51:44 - before
51:45 - you change
51:53 - i
51:54 - guess i could put this on get search
52:02 - try to figure out which
52:04 - which function to put this on
52:06 - um i guess
52:11 - we could put it on this fetch search
52:13 - term i definitely don't need a console
52:15 - of the search term anymore so let's just
52:16 - pop this in right here and see if that
52:19 - works
52:21 - whoops
52:22 - property node is undefined
52:27 - that's weird we didn't really change
52:28 - anything
52:31 - oops you know uh
52:33 - i think we didn't bring in router
52:37 - so we need to bring in router
52:39 - oops
52:50 - there we go
52:52 - uh okay we do have next router in there
52:54 - now so why is it not working
52:57 - oops
52:59 - i went to the wrong page
53:03 - and hey i found another error so
53:05 - academic words page does not work we'll
53:07 - have to write that down
53:08 - okay so let's do this
53:15 - hmm okay it didn't work what did i miss
53:18 - probably
53:20 - let's see
53:34 - let's put this somewhere else
53:36 - this set state
53:41 - where's the search term
53:54 - all right so i want to grab the search
53:55 - term
53:57 - after it's been set
54:04 - this is a search
54:11 - okay
54:12 - uh so right here we're setting the
54:14 - search term
54:18 - if the length we then we want to do
54:20 - debounced search all right so where's
54:22 - our d-bound search
54:26 - let's see
54:31 - d-bots there's the bouncers
54:35 - okay
54:36 - here's the bound search and that just
54:38 - does fetch search term which is what we
54:40 - were going for
54:44 - and get results
54:54 - so actually i mean this does seem like
54:56 - the right place to put it
55:06 - no
55:10 - let's put it back in here and make sure
55:12 - this state search you know what
55:14 - i was calling it search instead of
55:16 - search term
55:17 - that's that's the problem
55:21 - there we go
55:31 - there we go see it changed
55:33 - automatically awesome that was the
55:35 - problem i was trying to get it
55:37 - to give me something from state that
55:39 - didn't exist in state
55:41 - okay
55:43 - all right six minutes left
55:48 - all right
55:49 - and i'm while i'm answering the
55:51 - questions i'm just going to run
55:53 - do a commit run it through the tests
55:55 - make sure everything works
55:58 - check our status if that looks good
56:02 - we'll do a git add
56:04 - yarn cm that's just going to walk us
56:06 - through making a good commit message
56:08 - we're going to add a new feature
56:10 - and let's say
56:12 - um
56:16 - change
56:17 - url on
56:23 - all searches
56:26 - so we did we changed the url on all
56:28 - searches
56:31 - yeah that actually that's pretty much
56:34 - exactly what we did
56:37 - for the most part
56:40 - um
56:41 - no breaking changes as far as i know
56:44 - i don't know if it affects any issues i
56:46 - don't really want to check right now
56:51 - oh
56:52 - what happened
56:54 - router is defined but never used we
56:56 - never took router out from our drawer
57:01 - and we never took it out from our app
57:03 - bar
57:07 - let's make sure we save both of those
57:11 - now let's run it again
57:12 - we can run your rncm with a retry frag
57:15 - flagged right to your y
57:17 - and then that way we don't have to go
57:19 - through all that stuff that we just did
57:21 - we'll let that do its thing i'll check
57:22 - back in on in a minute
57:24 - in the meantime let me scroll up
57:27 - to where i left off
57:32 - for those of you who may be just joining
57:34 - us uh the coding portion of this is
57:36 - pretty much over we're going to do
57:37 - question answers if you have any
57:38 - questions
57:39 - please put them in the live chat now
57:40 - i'll do my best to answer
57:43 - all of them if i can
57:48 - onkit says in what language are you
57:51 - coding i'm using javascript in
57:53 - particular i'm using react
57:55 - in a syntax called jsx
57:57 - react as a javascript library so that's
57:59 - why it may look a little bit different
58:00 - from normal javascript okay we passed
58:03 - all our tests
58:04 - now i can push this
58:06 - git push
58:09 - origin
58:10 - search update
58:14 - this looks pretty good uh get
58:19 - master
58:20 - let's get
58:21 - checkout
58:25 - master
58:26 - we'll do a merge
58:29 - git merge
58:31 - search
58:33 - update
58:34 - awesome
58:37 - um
58:39 - let's do
58:40 - a
58:42 - a get push
58:43 - make sure that goes up there
58:47 - and then we'll do a test deploy
58:51 - uh let me double check what that
58:55 - is uh test deploy okay so let's run a
58:58 - yarn
59:00 - test deploy
59:04 - okay that's going to do a build and then
59:06 - it's going to do a test deployment it's
59:07 - going to give us a url we can check it
59:09 - out make sure it's working
59:10 - okay so that's going to take a little
59:12 - while
59:14 - let's see
59:22 - oh okay harshit says that so i earlier i
59:24 - was talking about a problem with builds
59:26 - not always working
59:28 - um
59:29 - or like it seems like they work but in
59:31 - reality they were not working
59:38 - r should say maybe it's due to lock
59:40 - files make sure using
59:42 - properly using yarn had a similar issue
59:44 - with netlify
59:47 - um is it the same kind of build
59:49 - environment
59:52 - sorry
59:53 - you know what
59:55 - sometimes i'm building on my laptop and
59:57 - sometimes i'm building here on this
59:58 - machine so it's possible that it is the
60:00 - the build environment off the double
60:02 - check
60:04 - whoa
60:09 - that's weird
60:10 - something happened
60:13 - g crowd crashed
60:24 - faculty.js not found or not accessible
60:27 - what is wrong with our faculty.js
60:30 - that's really weird
60:34 - it
60:35 - should be here
60:37 - looks good here all right let's run that
60:38 - again
60:41 - maybe there's something wrong with that
60:42 - build see what's happening
60:45 - uh
60:47 - mike says uh hey mate is there any
60:49 - chance i can add you on discord yeah
60:51 - yeah no problem
60:52 - um
60:53 - that's what i think it's jesse wago or
60:56 - jessie.weigle or something like that on
60:58 - discord
60:59 - uh
61:01 - mohawk says do you use brackets editor
61:03 - no i use visual studio code
61:13 - um
61:16 - cal young says how are you um
61:19 - good not bad i'm pretty i feel so much
61:21 - better now that i launched this site uh
61:23 - it was really kind of making me nervous
61:26 - so
61:28 - yeah pretty good actually i started
61:30 - getting back into working out on a more
61:32 - regular basis going like some more
61:34 - intense workouts so i'm feeling really
61:35 - good about that
61:37 - uh so anyway how you doing
61:43 - well it aired out again
61:47 - and he gave me a lot of info now
61:51 - interesting
62:04 - hmm
62:23 - all right i'm gonna have to check that
62:25 - out after the stream so i guess i'm not
62:26 - gonna do a test deploy right now which
62:28 - is fine because
62:30 - we got a lot of questions anyway
62:36 - uh kunal says how how do you do this um
62:41 - i i don't know i just
62:44 - have learned how to do it in practice
62:57 - uh practic says why react over angular
63:00 - um
63:02 - i guess at some point i wanted to learn
63:04 - react and so i started learning react
63:07 - and that's i mean that's pretty much why
63:10 - i worked with angular 1 back in the day
63:12 - and
63:14 - i had a hard time with it it was
63:16 - probably just my inexperience and didn't
63:18 - really have anything to do with angular
63:20 - but
63:20 - uh when i started working with react um
63:24 - for whatever reason i
63:26 - i picked it up more easily than i did
63:29 - angular and i really liked it so
63:32 - that's kind of why i've been sticking
63:33 - with react and i think you can build
63:36 - really cool things with with react
63:40 - harshit says i have a ton of experience
63:42 - with algolia but how are you going to
63:44 - index the item uh means you have a ton
63:46 - of stuff in wordpress spread around
63:49 - hardship that's exactly what my concern
63:51 - is is uh i i like algolia i've seen it
63:54 - in use i think it's awesome but
63:57 - i don't know how i'm gonna get it all
63:59 - the data that it needs
64:01 - but i need to implement something
64:03 - uh because the current search is
64:08 - i mean it's not what i think people
64:10 - would expect
64:12 - from search
64:16 - you know when they search in google it
64:18 - tries to predict what the most relevant
64:20 - search is going to be so i need
64:23 - something more like
64:24 - that uh and to be honest with you i'm
64:26 - not even sure if algolia is the right
64:28 - answer for that uh but i
64:31 - i've heard really good things about it
64:33 - so that's what i want to i want to try
64:35 - looking there first
64:43 - okay harsha says they have a great uh
64:45 - wordpress plugin um just make sure they
64:48 - support custom post types
64:51 - well if they have a wordpress plugin
64:52 - this might be a little bit
64:54 - easier so i do have on all the wordpress
64:57 - posts
64:58 - i i have the correct urls in there to
65:00 - handle the whole difference between what
65:02 - wordpress thinks the url is versus what
65:04 - the react url is
65:06 - so i already have that data in there
65:08 - that might make things easier
65:13 - uh space chiller says will you make a
65:14 - discord server uh i'm not gonna make a
65:16 - discord server right now
65:19 - um
65:20 - but there may already be one we have a
65:23 - lot of different places over you know
65:26 - the past year or so where we've tried to
65:29 - get some chat going
65:31 - um
65:33 - like slack
65:34 - uh trying to think where else
65:36 - we had a forum once
65:40 - i can't remember the other place where
65:42 - we had it so i don't know if we ever had
65:44 - discord or not
65:46 - if we already have something on discord
65:48 - and somebody remembers please let me
65:49 - know in the chat
65:51 - uh otherwise like i'm open to having a
65:52 - discord server for for the live stream
65:55 - stuff
65:57 - but i'm i'm not i just don't have a lot
65:59 - of time to make it right now
66:12 - uh galrav says i'm a first timer here do
66:15 - you have a github repo for this project
66:17 - yep the link to the repo is in the
66:18 - description
66:23 - uh adrian says hello how can i put that
66:26 - yellow line under the head function
66:28 - greetings from spain
66:32 - yellow line under the head function
66:36 - i'm
66:37 - i'm not sure what you mean
66:41 - uh so
66:43 - maybe clarify a little bit probably
66:45 - because it probably made sense when at
66:47 - that point but now i can't remember what
66:48 - i was doing when you asked that question
66:50 - so
66:51 - maybe explain a little bit more i'd be
66:52 - happy to let you know
66:55 - um
66:57 - daca is asking what language this is
67:00 - it's javascript
67:02 - react with javascript
67:09 - mysco says so lame
67:11 - i apologies for my lameness please let
67:14 - me know what i could do to make the
67:15 - stream less lame
67:17 - always trying to improve
67:20 - let's see
67:32 - says he sounds like joe budden lol
67:34 - i don't know who that is
67:38 - maybe i do sound like him i'm not really
67:39 - sure
67:48 - michael cruz says you take two weeks off
67:49 - and you've forgotten how to type
67:51 - i didn't take two weeks off i've been
67:53 - working really hard i just didn't stream
67:54 - for a long time
67:58 - i guess i forgot how to type and talk at
68:00 - the same time
68:05 - a hundred subscribers without a video
68:07 - challenge says love you i love you too
68:10 - thank you
68:12 - and good luck with your 100 subscribers
68:14 - without a video
68:24 - let's see
68:33 - sorry i'm skipping over some of the
68:34 - stuff that was about what we were
68:36 - working on earlier since we already got
68:38 - it to work i don't don't really need to
68:39 - read it all out
68:41 - um aniket says what's the current status
68:44 - um the site's launched now so it is live
68:47 - so everything we're doing now is like
68:48 - bug fixes or
68:50 - new features
68:53 - uh gaurav says you had dark mode on
68:55 - github how did you do that uh search for
68:57 - github dark
68:59 - on google or whatever search engine you
69:00 - like and it should be one of the first
69:03 - results
69:06 - yusuf says hi jesse it's good to see you
69:08 - again
69:09 - oh thanks for saying that and uh thanks
69:11 - for watching
69:13 - i did miss you all i i hadn't streamed
69:15 - for a while and things were just so
69:16 - crazy was trying to get it launched and
69:18 - back and forth between everybody that
69:20 - needed to be involved to make that
69:21 - happen so
69:23 - um
69:24 - i'm glad to be streaming again though
69:27 - um
69:29 - let's see
69:31 - eva says have do you have live coding
69:33 - streams about redux saga i've never done
69:36 - a stream about redux saga
69:38 - um so
69:40 - yeah i don't have any plans to use redux
69:42 - saga right now
69:44 - um if enough people were interested
69:45 - maybe i'd i'd try to do something a
69:48 - video about it or something like that
69:49 - but
69:50 - currently no i have used
69:53 - redux thunks before
69:56 - and
69:58 - i may have done a stream using redux
70:00 - thunk
70:02 - in the past
70:03 - i can't remember though
70:05 - uh it might be on my youtube channel so
70:07 - i have my own personal youtube channel
70:09 - it's uh jesse white jessie r weigle or
70:11 - jesse weigle something like that it
70:13 - might be linked in the description but
70:17 - i think maybe i've used it on that
70:18 - channel i don't really know
70:20 - um but anyway redux thunk is like
70:23 - usually seen as kind of an alternative
70:25 - to redux saga so it may be similar
70:29 - marcio says uh would you call this
70:32 - session a normal workday um
70:36 - yeah yeah this is pretty normal i guess
70:39 - um
70:42 - yeah
70:43 - i would say this is normal for like post
70:45 - launch right
70:50 - yeah and the fact that i'm trying to get
70:52 - it to work and i got to try a bunch of
70:54 - different things we go back and forth to
70:56 - documentation try it that's that's
70:58 - definitely how things normally work i
70:59 - mean sometimes i get on a roll and like
71:02 - things just work
71:03 - sometimes nothing works and i'm just
71:05 - stuck in reading documentation and
71:08 - trying things and going through error
71:09 - messages
71:11 - and then you know everything in between
71:13 - so
71:14 - i would say that's pretty pretty normal
71:16 - the stuff you don't see is like
71:19 - answering emails
71:20 - um
71:22 - going to meetings things like that i
71:23 - can't really put on the stream uh or it
71:26 - would be boring to put on the stream
71:28 - uh but when i'm actually getting to do
71:30 - code this is pretty much how it is
71:33 - also i do things like um
71:36 - assign tasks
71:38 - to other i like student workers and
71:40 - things like that so
71:42 - um occasionally i'll do little tutorial
71:44 - videos for them
71:46 - uh in instructions so
71:49 - i also do that as well
72:05 - uh to mania says did anyone have or
72:07 - catch jesse's instagram handle
72:09 - it is i believe it's jessie.yl oh okay
72:12 - michael creel typed it in the chat so
72:14 - you can see it in the chat jesse.weigle
72:16 - it's a j-e-s-s-e
72:18 - dot w-e-i-g-e-l so i mean like the
72:20 - little period not spelled out
72:29 - uh brian says how long have you been
72:31 - coding in this language in with
72:33 - javascript i think i've been doing
72:34 - javascript stuff for like five years
72:36 - react
72:37 - um two years
72:41 - somewhere around two years
72:42 - i think
72:48 - uh phoenix says
72:50 - hey jesse i thought that this would be
72:53 - done since we were launched
72:55 - websites are never done
72:56 - um especially when you work for a
72:58 - company and you're doing the sites if
73:00 - you're a contract worker like you're
73:01 - done when your contract's done so i mean
73:03 - that's i guess kind of nice but
73:05 - no the website is never done we're i
73:08 - mean we'll get to a point where we don't
73:09 - really have to do a lot with it and we
73:11 - move on to another project but
73:13 - uh for now we're gonna be working on
73:15 - updates to this for for a little while
73:17 - longer
73:22 - uh world boss says why don't you use
73:25 - angular
73:26 - um i
73:28 - because i know react i mean at this
73:29 - point i know a lot about react it would
73:32 - definitely be a step backwards for me in
73:35 - terms of productivity to try to learn
73:37 - angular i just i don't see the advantage
73:40 - of doing that even in the long run so if
73:43 - there's something about angular that
73:45 - would really help out
73:46 - um
73:48 - with my projects and my workflow and my
73:50 - efficiency then please let me know uh
73:53 - but
73:54 - at least from what i know
73:56 - you know react can fulfill all the
73:58 - requirements of what i need for my
73:59 - projects
74:01 - and since i've already been using it and
74:03 - can develop faster with it than i can
74:05 - with angular i'm just going to stick
74:06 - with react
74:10 - michael says
74:12 - okay just have a little conversation but
74:14 - i kind of like this this comment so i
74:16 - want to read it um it's just started
74:18 - looking for remote jobs but imposter
74:21 - syndrome is kicking in hard
74:23 - uh yeah so
74:25 - let me just comment on this because i i
74:28 - know a lot of people talk about imposter
74:29 - syndrome
74:31 - i definitely uh it it hits me sometimes
74:34 - as well not as much now as it used to um
74:38 - especially since i've been doing the
74:39 - stream
74:40 - because
74:42 - like when you all keep watching me even
74:44 - though i continue to mess up like it
74:46 - definitely
74:47 - uh builds up my confidence in the sense
74:49 - that like
74:50 - okay it doesn't really matter how bad i
74:52 - am like i'm still
74:54 - i'm still useful for something as a
74:56 - developer
74:58 - but
75:00 - when you're applying for jobs
75:02 - don't worry about thinking like am i
75:04 - good enough for this job
75:06 - that's not for you to decide
75:08 - the other people that are going to hire
75:09 - you are going to decide whether or not
75:11 - they want you okay your job is just to
75:13 - make yourself look as good as you can
75:15 - without lying
75:17 - and and get the info out there
75:19 - right if somebody's going to hire you
75:21 - for the job
75:23 - then they're gonna hire you
75:24 - if if they've hired you for some job and
75:26 - you're entirely like not qualified to do
75:29 - it and they don't provide you with the
75:30 - training and you fail
75:32 - that's their fault
75:33 - don't worry about it all right it's just
75:37 - uh this is how it works right you
75:40 - you are selling something and that's
75:42 - your abilities and your talent so you
75:44 - when you're selling something you make
75:46 - it look as good as you can without lying
75:48 - right
75:50 - the other person is going to make that
75:52 - decision
75:54 - based on a lot of reasons you may not
75:56 - even know about whether or not they want
75:58 - to buy what you're selling in this case
76:00 - your your services your ability your
76:02 - skills
76:03 - um
76:04 - don't worry about
76:06 - whether or not
76:07 - you're qualified or whatever you you
76:09 - just got to put it out there
76:11 - that you got something for sale
76:14 - okay so apply for as many many things as
76:16 - you can
76:17 - i've applied for jobs before where i
76:19 - didn't even meet the minimum
76:20 - requirements
76:21 - it's fine
76:23 - just and sometimes i've done that and
76:25 - i've been able to actually talk to
76:27 - people
76:28 - about the job you know
76:30 - i may never have gotten through to like
76:32 - the full interview step but it's still
76:34 - been a useful thing
76:35 - uh you know so
76:38 - i encourage you to just just apply right
76:41 - and uh don't don't worry about
76:44 - whether or not you think you can do it
76:52 - see
76:54 - phoenix says by the way jesse i've
76:55 - created my first blog site and made my
76:58 - first blog on it would you mind having a
77:00 - look at it on the stream we'd love to
77:01 - have feedback
77:02 - uh yeah phoenix send me
77:05 - since you can't do links on here haha
77:09 - you already sent it on twitter nice i
77:10 - was just gonna ask you to send it on
77:12 - twitter
77:13 - let's copy this link address and
77:17 - you know what
77:18 - let me
77:21 - let me get this ready
77:24 - and i will pull it over
77:26 - oh cool
77:27 - let me
77:28 - pull this over
77:30 - alright so this is phoenix's
77:34 - i lost my live chat where did you go
77:37 - okay
77:41 - wow i still had a live chat up from
77:45 - two weeks ago wow okay
77:47 - this is the correct one right
77:50 - wait is that still not the right one
77:54 - where is the right chat
78:02 - okay i thought for a second i closed out
78:05 - the wrong chat window but i i didn't
78:06 - alright so anyway this is phoenix's uh
78:09 - blog
78:10 - really cool
78:13 - really cool i like this
78:18 - where's my
78:24 - hmm
78:27 - this is really cool today i learned
78:29 - seriously
78:33 - really cool
78:39 - i like this
78:47 - that's cool thanks for sharing
78:53 - i think i like um
78:56 - let's see
78:59 - the thing i would say is in terms of
79:02 - feedback
79:06 - just from a design perspective since
79:08 - we're just looking at it is maybe
79:11 - uh if you're gonna have shadows you
79:13 - might maybe put a shadow on this as well
79:16 - uh to keep it consistent like that it
79:18 - seems like these are the same depth
79:21 - and then also i usually don't like to
79:23 - have a hover effect like how the shadow
79:25 - gets you know longer
79:27 - unless something's clickable
79:29 - so
79:30 - because it usually indicates to the user
79:32 - the thing is clickable you know not
79:34 - always but i think it's a common design
79:36 - pattern so you maybe might not want to
79:38 - have that hover shadow effect on this
79:41 - um if it's not going to be clickable
79:44 - um but
79:48 - other than that
79:50 - i think it's really cool
79:52 - and i kind of i really like
79:54 - you got a lot of code in there
79:59 - that's cool
80:04 - let me see what it looks like okay so
80:06 - this just goes down to the post nice
80:10 - cool
80:18 - uh gal rev says did you use any other
80:20 - boilerplate for react yeah this is the
80:22 - next next jf so it wasn't create react
80:25 - app so yeah it will be different
80:34 - uh prakar says i'm about to start
80:36 - learning react
80:37 - i just wanted to know uh
80:40 - what i should know about webpack es land
80:41 - babel because create react app contains
80:43 - everything bundled together yeah
80:45 - honestly if you want to start with react
80:47 - and use create react app you don't need
80:48 - to know anything about webpack es land
80:51 - babel none of that
80:52 - just worry about react
80:55 - down the road you may want to customize
80:57 - some of that stuff but
80:59 - you can definitely build awesome things
81:01 - without touching any of those things so
81:03 - i would just not worry about it at all
81:05 - right now
81:10 - let's see
81:24 - uh yoga says can you please share the
81:26 - code on github uh yeah there should be a
81:28 - link to this github repo in the
81:29 - description to the video
81:38 - kevin ward
81:39 - says
81:41 - versus js okay so let's talk about the
81:44 - errors we were getting
81:46 - um
81:48 - yeah that's that's a weird error
81:52 - yeah i'm not i'm not gonna have time to
81:54 - work this out on the stream i'll have to
81:55 - work it out later
82:01 - eventually says you look tired
82:04 - i'm a little bit tired i i woke up in
82:06 - the middle of the night last night so i
82:07 - didn't get like
82:09 - a good amount of uninterrupted sleep but
82:12 - not not too bad
82:23 - uh mammy says hello i missed classes my
82:26 - system crashed with the help of a hacker
82:28 - oh no i'm sorry to hear that
82:30 - i hope you get everything back up and
82:31 - running
82:33 - uh
82:34 - nikki says i've been listening to a lot
82:36 - of podcasts recently um headaches and
82:38 - not doing anything kind of forced me to
82:40 - catching up on lots of dead podcasts
82:42 - what are your favorites
82:44 - um i like
82:46 - actually
82:47 - i don't think i'm gonna be able to get
82:48 - to all the questions i'm gonna try to go
82:50 - through this fast so really quick i've
82:52 - been listening to the syntax
82:54 - uh podcast i think it's called syntax i
82:56 - like that one i like uh the free code
82:59 - camp podcast
83:01 - um
83:03 - it's not exactly developer one it's more
83:05 - of like a hacking one but dark net
83:07 - diaries is really cool
83:10 - i can't i know there's there's like
83:11 - three or four other ones i listen to and
83:13 - they're just slipping my mind right now
83:15 - so
83:16 - maybe i'll have to
83:17 - ask me again when i'm not running out of
83:19 - time maybe and i'll look on my
83:22 - uh list of podcasts and i'll tell you
83:24 - all the ones i'm listening to
83:28 - let's see
83:31 - michael says you have a chat window open
83:33 - for two weeks ago yes yes i do evidently
83:35 - i do
83:43 - um john hanson says server response time
83:46 - is very good for all the database calls
83:47 - is just because a specific header is
83:49 - sent to the server is just because the
83:50 - site's hosting on http version two
83:54 - uh i don't know really
83:56 - i don't i don't know why it's fast
84:03 - um it looks like i accidentally skipped
84:05 - some stuff
84:07 - um
84:09 - uh yeah it says new to react any
84:11 - suggestions for me
84:13 - uh just try to practice a little bit
84:15 - every day
84:17 - you know what let me check
84:31 - i'm double checking to make sure i have
84:32 - a meeting in a few minutes i don't want
84:34 - to cut the stream off if i'm not
84:39 - um
84:47 - okay harsha says
84:49 - we may have a discord server we had
84:51 - getter oh that's right we did have
84:52 - getter
85:04 - all right so it looks like
85:05 - the other people that are supposed to be
85:07 - on my meeting are in another meeting
85:08 - right now so it may have bought me a few
85:10 - minutes so i'm just going to keep
85:11 - streaming
85:31 - okay
85:33 - uh land rover says what's react used for
85:37 - for building
85:38 - web apps
85:39 - you can also use it for native apps
85:42 - and other things
85:49 - uh ventilis is where should i start
85:51 - learning
85:52 - coding uh free code camp
86:00 - let's see
86:04 - harsha says now i get that while you're
86:06 - getting build errors you're not
86:09 - you're not shutting down the next js
86:10 - development server so files are busy in
86:13 - the file system and messing things up
86:16 - ah
86:17 - okay
86:21 - let's see if this works then
86:41 - oh okay so phoenix says when the there
86:44 - are more posts
86:45 - you will have to click to expand so the
86:47 - hover effect all right that that's
86:49 - actually perfect so if that's going to
86:51 - be the case then i'd say yeah for sure
86:53 - keep the hover effect
87:03 - michael creo says how do you handle it
87:05 - when you get 200 likes on a tweet my
87:06 - phone is blowing up and it's getting
87:07 - annoying i don't know if i've ever had
87:09 - 200 likes on a tweet so i don't know how
87:11 - to handle it
87:19 - evan says just got here where do you go
87:21 - for daily code challenges i actually i
87:23 - don't sometimes i'll go to free code
87:25 - camp and do stuff
87:27 - looks like i'm still getting errors
87:29 - um
87:30 - otherwise i don't really do the daily
87:32 - code challenges
87:38 - jeju says hello change your theme
87:44 - um joe says can you make a project so we
87:47 - can learn um
87:49 - maybe maybe like on my channel i'll do
87:51 - something like that at some point if i
87:53 - get time
87:56 - gaurav says you can share the list of
87:58 - podcasts on twitter okay and maybe i'll
88:00 - do that
88:03 - joe says can you help me or else get a
88:04 - coding job with no degree yeah i'd say
88:06 - definitely try to go through the free
88:08 - coding camp free code camp lessons uh
88:11 - there are a lot of people that have
88:12 - gotten jobs like that
88:18 - harsha says what are you using for that
88:20 - meeting look up
88:25 - i'm not sure what you're saying i'm not
88:28 - sure what that refers to
88:31 - michael says that was a humble brag on
88:33 - my part
88:36 - all right cool i think
88:38 - yeah i definitely want to finish the
88:39 - chat up now
88:41 - um in case my meeting does start on time
88:43 - i don't want to be late for that because
88:44 - that's
88:46 - my boss and my boss's boss are both
88:47 - going to be in there
88:48 - um
88:52 - so
88:54 - yes i'm gonna finish up but thank you
88:56 - all so much for watching uh it looks
88:58 - like we had a lot of new people and uh
89:00 - so i hope you liked it if there's
89:01 - anything i can do to improve the streams

89:06 - and um
89:09 - oh harshit wanted to know how i knew
89:11 - other people were meeting because i

89:28 - and
89:31 - yeah so hopefully i'll see you all soon
89:32 - until then have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and the project that we've been working on for so long since at least january has finally launched uh so if you want to see the live version of the site it's at franciscan.edu which i'll type right now in the live chat so i'm gonna start out by telling you just a little bit about the launch and how things went and then we're gonna take a look at uh the trello board where i've been tracking you know everything really from all the extra features that i want to add and all the bugs that people have found and then i have found we're going to do a little triage all right which means we're going to figure out which things on the trello board which tasks are most important should be done first and then we're gonna try to get as many of those things done as we can in about an hour so i do have a meeting later on so we have a hard cap on how long this stream can go of course i will answer your questions as we go we'll use the pomodoro timer for those of you who are watching for the first time i am a fulltime frontend developer for a small university we have just built the main website for the university live over the course of a long time and you're getting a glimpse of my daytoday work i don't rehearse this uh this is what i'm actually doing uh for a living and so i will make mistakes and please call me out on it and i'll do my best to explain what i'm doing as i go along it's not really a tutorial though so don't feel bad if you get lost just you know ask questions uh it's totally fine let's see hey see a lot of people saying hi hey good to see you hey horchat's here good to see you um all right let me all right let me first just take i'm going to set a timer too i'm just going to take a few minutes and i'm going to tell you about how the launch went since i didn't stream it because it's a little bit crazy so basically this is how things went down last week at some point last week or the week before it was decided that we would try to launch on wednesday okay i was asked to give the earliest possible time that i thought we could launch and i said okay wednesday is good i knew i wouldn't be ready by monday um and i wanted to give myself a little buffer in case something went wrong so i said okay let's take tuesday and wednesday it is definitely didn't want to launch on a friday because things go wrong on a weekend then i have to go to work so wednesday we go for launch there was some issues uh where we had to verify that we own the domain with google but there were some issues with the it department and they were wondering to know well would how would the verification affect g suite and would that somehow give the website access to some g suite stuff so once we got all that sorted out on thursday i came into work and i went over with the the people in it we sat down we changed all the uh dns information and then over the course of that day slowly we saw uh the um all the dns stuff get updated because sometimes it takes a while got it all updated got everything running on google app engine and the site started to work and i started to get messages from people saying hey i found this link then it doesn't work or where's this piece of content i can't find it so it wasn't really that bad uh to be honest with you it was the response was uh overall like positive nobody nobody came talked to me directly or anything and said they don't like the website we did have some students well one student on facebook maybe a few students on facebook said that they didn't like certain parts of the site otherwise though not too bad um so overall really happy there were several people who actually came up to me that day and said congratulations and they love the site so that was really cool um no like major issues the site didn't crash nothing crazy like that just as some broken links and things so that's what mostly what i've been going through the only weird issue that i have that i haven't been able to figure out is that occasionally when i deployed a google app engine uh the build just the weird things break so the logos won't show up or certain pages uh will just cause an error and then if i just rebuild and redeploy it works um so what i'm done in instead and if anybody's interested i can show you how we've done this with app engine is i set up some some scripts in my pack package json to do a test build and deploy or it will deploy an instance to google app engine but it won't point the domain to that instance so i can go to just that custom url which it would it shows me whenever the build and deployment succeeds make sure everything works first and then do a real deploy with that same build okay so that's my deployment step now which is to be honest with you that's how it should be done i think that way there's this inbetween step of you know your development environment is local and then there's this test environment and then production so that's the flow now it was actually pretty simple once i found the documentation to figure out how to do that so i can i can show you that in a second but basically that's how everything went uh not too bad the only stressful thing is just trying to figure out what to do first because a lot of times i'll have multiple people messaging me and talking to me about we want this done or that done and uh just trying to like handle all those things coming in while i'm working on other things uh is not overwhelming but it's just you know um challenging right okay i see a lot of people saying hi i just want to say hey everybody i'm going to set a 25 minute timer at the end of that timer i'm going to go to the live chat and i'm going to answer your questions and and check out what you've been saying so um i see yeah somebody's son keeps saying hi a lot so i'm just going to say hi to you since you're really excited about that okay um let's see all right timer is set i'm going to share my screen now and let me show you first i'm going to show you that script since i just talked about it i'm going to show it to you i don't know if this would apply to anybody if you're not using google app engine i'd like to go through maybe on a stream one day or on a recorded video and kind of show you the flow of how everything's set up like a big overview uh but for now uh this is what i've done hopefully you can see that let me know if it's too small for now uh we have are our test deploy which actually runs the build first so it does our build step which is just next build right and then it does a oops here's your test deploy it does a gcloud app deploy with a no promote flag okay so that means it's not going to automatically point the url to the latest version which it normally would do right so the step would then be do this go to the url that it tells me it's it's launched this instance to make sure that it works and then i can run deploy right which is a g cloud app deploy if for some reason i needed to just do things really fast maybe an emergency change i could just run a build deploy which would build and deploy right to the live version immediately this is what i was doing at first and it didn't always work out so it wasn't like catastrophic but you know there was a time where i deployed something before i came into work when i was still at home and didn't realize that a certain section of the site wasn't working anymore and then when i got to work i realized it you know but there was i don't know maybe around an hour of time that a section of the site wasn't working so i'm definitely going to stick with this now and just hit those sections of the site that i know have been affected so mainly some things on the homepage and things on faculty list pages those are the only areas that i know have been affected so far uh okay all right so now let me show you our trello board and this will be the last thing we do before we actually get started so i'm going to try to zoom in and show you this is what i was working on right before i started the stream so i just finished the pomodoro session with this and um i'm just working on a a student here ran some some scans and found a bunch of links and stuff super helpful and i forwarded me all the info so i grabbed it all and just made a checklist of it and i'm just going through and checking some of these broken links a lot of them i had already fixed by fixing like previous issues so right now it's just a matter of checking these links making sure they work now and then checking them off so i'm almost through that one uh i don't know that that'll be that exciting for a stream or informative so let's check out some of the other things we have i mainly want to look at these two areas because i've already sorted through what i think are really important things and put them in here so we're just going to look at the ones that are assigned to me so they have my little my image right there we just looked at these links so the in progress column is going to be the most important things right now um make edits to grad education pages let's check out what's in here i don't even remember this uh looks like they're broken links got education okay you know what these edits i got these from um someone else that that works here at the university earlier today a lot of these are just uh text edits so that's not it's not really going to involve coding so we're gonna skip that for now uh this testing i've mainly been having my one of my student workers work on this and now there's there's a large list of things that need work done that might be a decent candidate uh let's see i do want to research using algolia for the search because i'm not satisfied with the way the search results are coming in right now so if anybody has experience with algolia let me know what you think of it uh if if you had a good experience bad experience if you have any advice for the best way to go about doing that please let me know i think it's worth it algolia is a paid service uh if you want to be able to use all the features wow i have a lot of viewers right now hey everybody uh please if anybody's a new viewer you're not sure what's going on please feel free to ask questions i may not get to it for a little while i'm running this timer but i imagine there's probably a lot of first time viewers right now uh so in about 20 minutes i'm going to do a little question and answer session so if you can stick around till then i'll answer any questions that you have okay so i'd rather not do research on the stream so that's probably out uh let's see just like search urls add new draw links all right you know what these are all not that exciting so here's what we'll do let me let me go through this really quick oops not this one this stuff and let's see if there'd be something a little bit more exciting in here when you go to the search tab without searching anything the top search option is unclickable all right let's check that out that's kind of a weird thing i'm not really sure what it means alright so my student worker reported this bug let's check out what the bug is and let's see uh if we can fix it right so let me i'm gonna start up my oh no there we go i'm going to start up ngrok uh this is going to let you check out the site as we're working on it you can see the site live now if you want but also you can click on the link i just pasted in there if it doesn't work when you click it copy and paste it in your browser and that should work but you'll be able to click around on the site inspect it with your dev tools you know whatever you want i'm gonna go to well first let's go to the site so i'm going to go to the local host version and see if we can replicate it here if not we'll go to the live version so let's go to the search page i'm not actually even sure how the my student worker got to the search page without clicking on a search but uh regardless okay so we're on the search page we haven't searched for anything and now let's try to click this um okay all right so this seems to be the issue that if you try to use the top search bar when you're on the search page a search does not occur okay what if all right let me share with you the couple of solutions that are going through my head right now okay um number one we could just take away the search option in the top if we're on the search page that's an option there's really no need to have more than one search on the search page you know what else i'm also going to assume that the search on the side here doesn't work let's check that out and that is the case okay so neither search option works on the search page so um we could try to get them to work or we could remove them now that there's two of them to remove i don't know if i want to remove two that might actually be more work than just fixing this so let's look into the code and see why this isn't working i think the reason is going to be because the the way these work depends on a route change and since no route change is happening right because we're already on the search page that's that's why this isn't working but uh there is something i actually wanted to implement so i'm kind of glad this came up i want to implement it so that the search will look here at the address bar you might not be able to see it uh small but it'll look at the search query here and automatically search so that if a person bookmarked a search they could come back and see the same search now all this may not even matter if we go with algolia but for now i don't know how soon we're gonna go with algolia if at all so i think it might be worth it to implement this let's see so we need to check out our search page and you know what let's see let's see where that card is for the search because i do i believe i had it on here let's look over here wow let me let me do it let's do a search for this uh add search euros test search page autofocus fix up so did i not do this hmm all right i'm not gonna keep looking for that i thought i already had a card for that i guess not it's possible i just made a github issue for it instead uh but i'm not gonna do that uh let's see i'm gonna i'm getting some feedback from you all about this so i'm just gonna go to the live chat now uh john hanson says the side search menu will fail for search term if if the search page route is there uh michael creole says why not make this search bar component so that no matter where it is it acts the same um that's not a bad idea i don't know if we'll do that right now uh i don't know if i'll have time for to do that but that's actually not a bad idea um first thing let's go to our search page and see what we have going on see how difficult this is gonna be uh to do okay all right so on our search page let's see our search term it's probably going to determine what we search right so we'll most likely need to grab what's in the url and put it into our state under search term so let's see uh component did mount create base search looks like we're already doing some things with search and we're already getting a new location search but are we already getting the search term interesting oh you know what i think i know what the problem is so this happens when a component did mount right um when we're here on the page already uh this this page component is already mounted so when we change this it doesn't change the state of that component so that component doesn't rerender we we don't get this doesn't run again so that's our problem right now hmm all right this is going to be it's going to be a little bit more difficult than i had hoped uh mostly because of where these components all live right uh right now like the easiest way to do this would just be to i don't know call call some of these functions whenever we change um the search components right on the side drawer and on the app bar but unfortunately these aren't shared so i'm gonna look harsh it's saying you could use to get snapshot before update or get derived state from props okay you know what i just got who said it michael creole says there's a learning experience i've been playing around with search trying to make it work with graphql still can't figure it out uh that actually gave me an idea what if all right let me talk through this you all let me know what you think what if we stored the search term in um i can't remember what it's called an apollo like like a universal store right for for the entire application so um i don't think we've done that yet with apollo though but potentially i think that could work uh let's see has anybody used that with basically um you use the capabilities that apollo has that act kind of like redux right john hanson says local storage yeah i mean not exactly local storage we could use local storage but i was thinking more of um what apollo has let's double check really quick um apollo let's go to apollo graphql to their docs and react there we go local state management link state that's what it's called oh harshit says since it happens on route change use nexjs route listeners okay i like that idea let's check this out multiple releases i just want to go to the github page there we go if you go to the next github page you can just do a control fine no event or i'm what was it route listeners say route well at least we have the route if you don't want to listen here we are here's how to properly listen for router event and around change router events on all right cool let's try to listen to this then and do we need to import yeah we'll probably need to import router so let's grab that first let's import router if i'm not already yeah i'm not already doing it so we're going to import router from next router let me zoom in a little bit so the idea here is if we could just use this to listen for a route change we can trigger what was already happening on componentdid mount but instead we're going to trigger the same thing on a route change okay so let's just copy what they have here all right so the way this will go is on the route change it's just going to call whatever function we give it and in this case it's handled route change but for in in our case we're probably just going to call something we already have so i'm going to put this i'm not sure where we need to put this let me double check where's this thing put this i guess we can put it right out here with with the rest of it i'm gonna try to put it closer to the component it's gonna call so hopefully it'll make more sense so let's put it up here router i thought we're importing router right i'm using it put it in component did mount all right so harsh it's saying put it in component did mount oh what did i just do there we go i think i accidentally copied the wrong thing all right let's try it again okay we'll put it in component did mount okay so that'll fire this off one component did mount and then we'll call um we can pass component amount to it interesting okay um okay i don't think i've ever tried to call component did mount this is gonna be interesting let's see if it works all right where are we at no property on of undefined router events hmm that's odd right because we this is exactly how it has it here i wonder if they have an example that we can look at usually they have examples um uh let's check out these examples i want that let's go to our pages uh let's see the index page maybe it'll have it on here nope uh let's try here no i just want to know where they have the router touch it there we are they use the next router here okay so they just have router events here okay all right let's just let's make a little switch here let's take it out of here and we'll put it up here and then let's do this because i kind of i like i kind of like this um we'll pass in url yeah let's just pull this whole thing for now so like how they're doing this so we're going to pass in i guess we don't really need to pass in the url right but we do need to i do want to call multiple things so we would call i guess these three and why again we have the weird squiggly line on router unless i see this needs to go outside of here there we go i'm not sure though if i'm going to be able to call these functions from outside here let's see what error we get still getting that same on air uh you know what harsh is saying maybe i need to update next js you know what you're right i think i'm not using the latest version all right let's see how much time we have oh okay almost time for question and answer so we'll do some questions and answers and then we'll decide whether or not we're going to try to update next js right now definitely going to make another branch let's do that right now get check out the um search update so i'm going to get checkout with a b flag so that will make a new branch and check out that new branch at the same time i'm going to call it search update okay that way uh anything we do now will not mess up our main master branch okay let's i'm gonna do a five minute timer and answer some questions so i'm gonna scroll up to the top try to get through as many questions as i can in this five minutes and then we'll do go back and do some coding okay uh someone's interested in python programming uh i personally don't do any python uh not on the stream or anything but there are definitely some other videos on uh this channel where i use all different types of programming languages so maybe just do a little search for python inside the free code camp channel and you know you'll probably find something let's see okay see a lot of you saying hi i'm not going to say all your names individually sorry but i just want to make sure we have enough time to get something done in this stream um love neet says is react good enough for a job uh yeah for sure there are a ton of react jobs out there i see uh reacting job listings all the time like almost every day i see a job listing for react i get them like sent to my email and on linkedin and everything so i see them all the time uh karante says much appreciated for the stream um thanks i i'm glad you said that always love to hear that um the stream is of value uh to you all um steven says howdy long time viewer first time poster oh awesome well thanks for watching and uh thanks for letting me know you're out there uh mike asks if i had have discord i do have discord my name is probably jesse weigle on discord it's pretty much the same everywhere um moosh mooshfeek says do you use php in frontend development do you have to use php in front of development no not at all php is not a front end thing if you want to do wordpress development it might not hurt to know some php but otherwise i really don't do much php at all andrew says hey if you're still in the market for a new keyboard i would recommend something mechanical if you give me a budget i could try to point you in the right direction okay cool so for those of you who follow me on instagram you might already know this but i'm looking for suggestions for keyboards i have a new setup at home that i'm working on and i'm gonna maybe i'll show you all my new setup on instagram uh if you want to follow me on there it's uh jesse.weigle i think is my name but um i have this old keyboard i really don't like how it feels so i'm looking for suggestions my budget right now is like i don't want to spend a lot on a keyboard i've never used a mechanical one so i'd like to get kind of like a lower priced keyboard um i don't know like for sure under 100 uh for a keyboard you know maybe like around 50 would be even better i know that's not a lot for mechanical keyboard but i don't want to invest a lot into one until i really get the experience of typing on one and get a feel for what i like and don't like about them uh let's see uh did um jamal i'm sorry i'm not sure how to pronounce that it's dg d j a m a l says are you contributing to react no i have not contributed to the you know react code base but it'd be awesome to do so i just don't have the time right now but i'd love to at some point since i've used react for so much it'd be great to give back uh love needs says how will i become like you as a react coder um i just just practice and um try to be better than me right um uh i'm not sure that i'm like any type of goal to aspire to but uh yeah just practice read documentation build things with react uh don't be afraid to just build things and don't worry so much is like is this the right way to do it just build uh you'll get better you can always go back and refactor things but the most important thing to get better at coding is is to code code and try to improve uh every every time you build something new try to expand what you can do and build more hey all right looks like i'm not going to get through all the questions right now but i will definitely try to get through them on my after we do a little bit more coding um let me see i'm going to write down where i leave off so i don't miss anyone's questions here's what we're going to do i'm going to start this timer for another pomodoro session but if we get finished before it ends i'm just going to go write the question so we have more time for questions okay um i think especially since we just made a new branch i'm gonna try to update next uh on on the air so i'm gonna go through all the steps that i normally do when i update like a major package that i'm using so first let's go to next and i'm gonna go up here to releases and let's find out which release area so we're gonna go to latest release so i'm not going to update to one of these canary releases they have all the latest features but they also have more bugs than a stable release so i'm going to go to latest release 6.1.2 and we're going to check out any release notes okay and it looks like there's not see like normally we would see they would say breaking changes here and there's no breaking changes so i think we're good to go and it'll tell you usually we could scroll down on most packages is it gonna say it usually it'll say what to type into to use this and actually hmm let's go to the docs just to see if we have this this ability and the latest stable release there we go okay so we we can listen for router events with the latest release on route change start oh you know what it has a different syntax okay you know what let's just try this now i still want to update next but let's see if this syntax works and if it does at least we'll have it working and then we can update next if we want to okay so i yeah we still need to import router but now instead of router events on we're going to go on route change start and we'll just copy and paste this stuff in here get rid of this one and see if this works now we'll go back to okay we didn't get an error this time which is nice and all right that was a good sign because it looked like it used what was up here and it automatically searched so let's let's change this um that was nice okay that that searching based on a url change which is awesome now here's the next test we'll go back and do a search for the okay and that didn't work so this is still not working it did update this but it updated it in in a way that didn't trigger oh accidentally clicked that so it didn't trigger that on route change start so let's look at how we're we're pushing that route uh so let's let's go to the drawer component since we we have it open already and let me see if i can find search i guess i could have searched for something better okay here's okay so we do a handle search let's look for that handle search okay so we're doing router push path name so we're doing a push so let's look at the routes and see if we could do this part in a different way so that it would cause cause the event to get registered right so as it gets picked up so we're gonna go back to our documentation and i guess we'll use this documentation although i really wish there were a dark theme for this you know it's killing my eyes uh routing okay routing with link that's not what we want to do not what we want to do where yet there we are so you want to use this router push that's right you may wish to listen to pop state react for the router does it print some forces or something refresh we could use push and replace a url all right i'm going to double check the chat to see if you all have have typed in some advice okay harsh it's saying yarn upgrade interactive latest might give you a heart attack after seeing how many packages are out of date i know i haven't updated any packages for two or three weeks because i knew launch was coming so i didn't want to break anything too bad before launch um but i do want to start getting things updated now because i don't like to go too long without updating okay let's see all right i don't see anything so let's just keep on going with this push in place props you're a push okay so maybe on before he's viruses for changing the browser's history well let's see if we're changing the browser history actually we are okay let's let's try this then uh let's try to listen for a change in browser history where am i at i can get rid of these two yeah i mean we could try to listen for this i i don't i don't really know if it's gonna work but it's worth a shot and it means we don't have to change that much okay all right so let's see this now let's um hmm okay so that didn't work either let me i'm gonna refresh just to be sure that i picked up that change although i'm pretty sure it did okay yeah so that's not picking it up either uh the history see okay all right what we could do we could force we could force a change so if we didn't use the router and we just used the normal like browser api we could potentially force a change right um we could try it let's see how much time we have all right so we could try to try that or we could try upgrading to the next version of next and see if we then could use some of the newer stuff actually you know we couldn't right so the documentation we read at first on github was for the canary release this documentation is for the latest release which is what we would be upgrading to so this is what we would be using so if we wanted to use the latest stuff we'd have to wait until that actually came into the latest stable release so here's what i want to try this will be the last thing i try uh before we do some questions because i don't wanna i don't wanna go too long with the coding and not be able to answer your questions okay so we're gonna go to we'll go to the drawer component for now and instead of using router push let's if the state search let's comment this out for now and instead let's do window dots location i'm doing this for memory let's see if this works i equals search search equals okay so here's what i'm doing uh i'm going to use the browsers api to change the window location and see if that'll trigger anything i'm going for memory here so i don't even know if this is the right way to say it um let's see search okay so i'm just using a template literal so that i can put javascript in the middle of this and grab this state so let's save that see if we get an error or anything okay nothing right off the bat we'll let this do its thing and then we'll try to search from that side drawer there which is what we just changed nice that worked alright cool i do want to verify that that changed the browser history it does awesome so now let's just take what we just did there and we can get rid of that and we'll just take this and use it in our app bar component so let's find our app bar and find the search there see if we have handle search here as well we do so we're going to remove this router push and put that in there we're going to save it and now oh try it yay it works all right cool let's also verify that this still works okay uh the one thing i would want to do and i don't know if we'll have time today to do that but you can see i just searched for biology here and i did get the biology results but it didn't change in the url it still has the url for the other uh type of search so what i would want to do then is make it so that when a search happens here it does actually change the url so actually you know what we can do for that let's do this router push okay we're going to do the router push but we're going to put it in the search so that when this happens um before you change i guess i could put this on get search try to figure out which which function to put this on um i guess we could put it on this fetch search term i definitely don't need a console of the search term anymore so let's just pop this in right here and see if that works whoops property node is undefined that's weird we didn't really change anything oops you know uh i think we didn't bring in router so we need to bring in router oops there we go uh okay we do have next router in there now so why is it not working oops i went to the wrong page and hey i found another error so academic words page does not work we'll have to write that down okay so let's do this hmm okay it didn't work what did i miss probably let's see let's put this somewhere else this set state where's the search term all right so i want to grab the search term after it's been set this is a search okay uh so right here we're setting the search term if the length we then we want to do debounced search all right so where's our dbound search let's see dbots there's the bouncers okay here's the bound search and that just does fetch search term which is what we were going for and get results so actually i mean this does seem like the right place to put it no let's put it back in here and make sure this state search you know what i was calling it search instead of search term that's that's the problem there we go there we go see it changed automatically awesome that was the problem i was trying to get it to give me something from state that didn't exist in state okay all right six minutes left all right and i'm while i'm answering the questions i'm just going to run do a commit run it through the tests make sure everything works check our status if that looks good we'll do a git add yarn cm that's just going to walk us through making a good commit message we're going to add a new feature and let's say um change url on all searches so we did we changed the url on all searches yeah that actually that's pretty much exactly what we did for the most part um no breaking changes as far as i know i don't know if it affects any issues i don't really want to check right now oh what happened router is defined but never used we never took router out from our drawer and we never took it out from our app bar let's make sure we save both of those now let's run it again we can run your rncm with a retry frag flagged right to your y and then that way we don't have to go through all that stuff that we just did we'll let that do its thing i'll check back in on in a minute in the meantime let me scroll up to where i left off for those of you who may be just joining us uh the coding portion of this is pretty much over we're going to do question answers if you have any questions please put them in the live chat now i'll do my best to answer all of them if i can onkit says in what language are you coding i'm using javascript in particular i'm using react in a syntax called jsx react as a javascript library so that's why it may look a little bit different from normal javascript okay we passed all our tests now i can push this git push origin search update this looks pretty good uh get master let's get checkout master we'll do a merge git merge search update awesome um let's do a a get push make sure that goes up there and then we'll do a test deploy uh let me double check what that is uh test deploy okay so let's run a yarn test deploy okay that's going to do a build and then it's going to do a test deployment it's going to give us a url we can check it out make sure it's working okay so that's going to take a little while let's see oh okay harshit says that so i earlier i was talking about a problem with builds not always working um or like it seems like they work but in reality they were not working r should say maybe it's due to lock files make sure using properly using yarn had a similar issue with netlify um is it the same kind of build environment sorry you know what sometimes i'm building on my laptop and sometimes i'm building here on this machine so it's possible that it is the the build environment off the double check whoa that's weird something happened g crowd crashed faculty.js not found or not accessible what is wrong with our faculty.js that's really weird it should be here looks good here all right let's run that again maybe there's something wrong with that build see what's happening uh mike says uh hey mate is there any chance i can add you on discord yeah yeah no problem um that's what i think it's jesse wago or jessie.weigle or something like that on discord uh mohawk says do you use brackets editor no i use visual studio code um cal young says how are you um good not bad i'm pretty i feel so much better now that i launched this site uh it was really kind of making me nervous so yeah pretty good actually i started getting back into working out on a more regular basis going like some more intense workouts so i'm feeling really good about that uh so anyway how you doing well it aired out again and he gave me a lot of info now interesting hmm all right i'm gonna have to check that out after the stream so i guess i'm not gonna do a test deploy right now which is fine because we got a lot of questions anyway uh kunal says how how do you do this um i i don't know i just have learned how to do it in practice uh practic says why react over angular um i guess at some point i wanted to learn react and so i started learning react and that's i mean that's pretty much why i worked with angular 1 back in the day and i had a hard time with it it was probably just my inexperience and didn't really have anything to do with angular but uh when i started working with react um for whatever reason i i picked it up more easily than i did angular and i really liked it so that's kind of why i've been sticking with react and i think you can build really cool things with with react harshit says i have a ton of experience with algolia but how are you going to index the item uh means you have a ton of stuff in wordpress spread around hardship that's exactly what my concern is is uh i i like algolia i've seen it in use i think it's awesome but i don't know how i'm gonna get it all the data that it needs but i need to implement something uh because the current search is i mean it's not what i think people would expect from search you know when they search in google it tries to predict what the most relevant search is going to be so i need something more like that uh and to be honest with you i'm not even sure if algolia is the right answer for that uh but i i've heard really good things about it so that's what i want to i want to try looking there first okay harsha says they have a great uh wordpress plugin um just make sure they support custom post types well if they have a wordpress plugin this might be a little bit easier so i do have on all the wordpress posts i i have the correct urls in there to handle the whole difference between what wordpress thinks the url is versus what the react url is so i already have that data in there that might make things easier uh space chiller says will you make a discord server uh i'm not gonna make a discord server right now um but there may already be one we have a lot of different places over you know the past year or so where we've tried to get some chat going um like slack uh trying to think where else we had a forum once i can't remember the other place where we had it so i don't know if we ever had discord or not if we already have something on discord and somebody remembers please let me know in the chat uh otherwise like i'm open to having a discord server for for the live stream stuff but i'm i'm not i just don't have a lot of time to make it right now uh galrav says i'm a first timer here do you have a github repo for this project yep the link to the repo is in the description uh adrian says hello how can i put that yellow line under the head function greetings from spain yellow line under the head function i'm i'm not sure what you mean uh so maybe clarify a little bit probably because it probably made sense when at that point but now i can't remember what i was doing when you asked that question so maybe explain a little bit more i'd be happy to let you know um daca is asking what language this is it's javascript react with javascript mysco says so lame i apologies for my lameness please let me know what i could do to make the stream less lame always trying to improve let's see says he sounds like joe budden lol i don't know who that is maybe i do sound like him i'm not really sure michael cruz says you take two weeks off and you've forgotten how to type i didn't take two weeks off i've been working really hard i just didn't stream for a long time i guess i forgot how to type and talk at the same time a hundred subscribers without a video challenge says love you i love you too thank you and good luck with your 100 subscribers without a video let's see sorry i'm skipping over some of the stuff that was about what we were working on earlier since we already got it to work i don't don't really need to read it all out um aniket says what's the current status um the site's launched now so it is live so everything we're doing now is like bug fixes or new features uh gaurav says you had dark mode on github how did you do that uh search for github dark on google or whatever search engine you like and it should be one of the first results yusuf says hi jesse it's good to see you again oh thanks for saying that and uh thanks for watching i did miss you all i i hadn't streamed for a while and things were just so crazy was trying to get it launched and back and forth between everybody that needed to be involved to make that happen so um i'm glad to be streaming again though um let's see eva says have do you have live coding streams about redux saga i've never done a stream about redux saga um so yeah i don't have any plans to use redux saga right now um if enough people were interested maybe i'd i'd try to do something a video about it or something like that but currently no i have used redux thunks before and i may have done a stream using redux thunk in the past i can't remember though uh it might be on my youtube channel so i have my own personal youtube channel it's uh jesse white jessie r weigle or jesse weigle something like that it might be linked in the description but i think maybe i've used it on that channel i don't really know um but anyway redux thunk is like usually seen as kind of an alternative to redux saga so it may be similar marcio says uh would you call this session a normal workday um yeah yeah this is pretty normal i guess um yeah i would say this is normal for like post launch right yeah and the fact that i'm trying to get it to work and i got to try a bunch of different things we go back and forth to documentation try it that's that's definitely how things normally work i mean sometimes i get on a roll and like things just work sometimes nothing works and i'm just stuck in reading documentation and trying things and going through error messages and then you know everything in between so i would say that's pretty pretty normal the stuff you don't see is like answering emails um going to meetings things like that i can't really put on the stream uh or it would be boring to put on the stream uh but when i'm actually getting to do code this is pretty much how it is also i do things like um assign tasks to other i like student workers and things like that so um occasionally i'll do little tutorial videos for them uh in instructions so i also do that as well uh to mania says did anyone have or catch jesse's instagram handle it is i believe it's jessie.yl oh okay michael creel typed it in the chat so you can see it in the chat jesse.weigle it's a jesse dot weigel so i mean like the little period not spelled out uh brian says how long have you been coding in this language in with javascript i think i've been doing javascript stuff for like five years react um two years somewhere around two years i think uh phoenix says hey jesse i thought that this would be done since we were launched websites are never done um especially when you work for a company and you're doing the sites if you're a contract worker like you're done when your contract's done so i mean that's i guess kind of nice but no the website is never done we're i mean we'll get to a point where we don't really have to do a lot with it and we move on to another project but uh for now we're gonna be working on updates to this for for a little while longer uh world boss says why don't you use angular um i because i know react i mean at this point i know a lot about react it would definitely be a step backwards for me in terms of productivity to try to learn angular i just i don't see the advantage of doing that even in the long run so if there's something about angular that would really help out um with my projects and my workflow and my efficiency then please let me know uh but at least from what i know you know react can fulfill all the requirements of what i need for my projects and since i've already been using it and can develop faster with it than i can with angular i'm just going to stick with react michael says okay just have a little conversation but i kind of like this this comment so i want to read it um it's just started looking for remote jobs but imposter syndrome is kicking in hard uh yeah so let me just comment on this because i i know a lot of people talk about imposter syndrome i definitely uh it it hits me sometimes as well not as much now as it used to um especially since i've been doing the stream because like when you all keep watching me even though i continue to mess up like it definitely uh builds up my confidence in the sense that like okay it doesn't really matter how bad i am like i'm still i'm still useful for something as a developer but when you're applying for jobs don't worry about thinking like am i good enough for this job that's not for you to decide the other people that are going to hire you are going to decide whether or not they want you okay your job is just to make yourself look as good as you can without lying and and get the info out there right if somebody's going to hire you for the job then they're gonna hire you if if they've hired you for some job and you're entirely like not qualified to do it and they don't provide you with the training and you fail that's their fault don't worry about it all right it's just uh this is how it works right you you are selling something and that's your abilities and your talent so you when you're selling something you make it look as good as you can without lying right the other person is going to make that decision based on a lot of reasons you may not even know about whether or not they want to buy what you're selling in this case your your services your ability your skills um don't worry about whether or not you're qualified or whatever you you just got to put it out there that you got something for sale okay so apply for as many many things as you can i've applied for jobs before where i didn't even meet the minimum requirements it's fine just and sometimes i've done that and i've been able to actually talk to people about the job you know i may never have gotten through to like the full interview step but it's still been a useful thing uh you know so i encourage you to just just apply right and uh don't don't worry about whether or not you think you can do it see phoenix says by the way jesse i've created my first blog site and made my first blog on it would you mind having a look at it on the stream we'd love to have feedback uh yeah phoenix send me since you can't do links on here haha you already sent it on twitter nice i was just gonna ask you to send it on twitter let's copy this link address and you know what let me let me get this ready and i will pull it over oh cool let me pull this over alright so this is phoenix's i lost my live chat where did you go okay wow i still had a live chat up from two weeks ago wow okay this is the correct one right wait is that still not the right one where is the right chat okay i thought for a second i closed out the wrong chat window but i i didn't alright so anyway this is phoenix's uh blog really cool really cool i like this where's my hmm this is really cool today i learned seriously really cool i like this that's cool thanks for sharing i think i like um let's see the thing i would say is in terms of feedback just from a design perspective since we're just looking at it is maybe uh if you're gonna have shadows you might maybe put a shadow on this as well uh to keep it consistent like that it seems like these are the same depth and then also i usually don't like to have a hover effect like how the shadow gets you know longer unless something's clickable so because it usually indicates to the user the thing is clickable you know not always but i think it's a common design pattern so you maybe might not want to have that hover shadow effect on this um if it's not going to be clickable um but other than that i think it's really cool and i kind of i really like you got a lot of code in there that's cool let me see what it looks like okay so this just goes down to the post nice cool uh gal rev says did you use any other boilerplate for react yeah this is the next next jf so it wasn't create react app so yeah it will be different uh prakar says i'm about to start learning react i just wanted to know uh what i should know about webpack es land babel because create react app contains everything bundled together yeah honestly if you want to start with react and use create react app you don't need to know anything about webpack es land babel none of that just worry about react down the road you may want to customize some of that stuff but you can definitely build awesome things without touching any of those things so i would just not worry about it at all right now let's see uh yoga says can you please share the code on github uh yeah there should be a link to this github repo in the description to the video kevin ward says versus js okay so let's talk about the errors we were getting um yeah that's that's a weird error yeah i'm not i'm not gonna have time to work this out on the stream i'll have to work it out later eventually says you look tired i'm a little bit tired i i woke up in the middle of the night last night so i didn't get like a good amount of uninterrupted sleep but not not too bad uh mammy says hello i missed classes my system crashed with the help of a hacker oh no i'm sorry to hear that i hope you get everything back up and running uh nikki says i've been listening to a lot of podcasts recently um headaches and not doing anything kind of forced me to catching up on lots of dead podcasts what are your favorites um i like actually i don't think i'm gonna be able to get to all the questions i'm gonna try to go through this fast so really quick i've been listening to the syntax uh podcast i think it's called syntax i like that one i like uh the free code camp podcast um it's not exactly developer one it's more of like a hacking one but dark net diaries is really cool i can't i know there's there's like three or four other ones i listen to and they're just slipping my mind right now so maybe i'll have to ask me again when i'm not running out of time maybe and i'll look on my uh list of podcasts and i'll tell you all the ones i'm listening to let's see michael says you have a chat window open for two weeks ago yes yes i do evidently i do um john hanson says server response time is very good for all the database calls is just because a specific header is sent to the server is just because the site's hosting on http version two uh i don't know really i don't i don't know why it's fast um it looks like i accidentally skipped some stuff um uh yeah it says new to react any suggestions for me uh just try to practice a little bit every day you know what let me check i'm double checking to make sure i have a meeting in a few minutes i don't want to cut the stream off if i'm not um okay harsha says we may have a discord server we had getter oh that's right we did have getter all right so it looks like the other people that are supposed to be on my meeting are in another meeting right now so it may have bought me a few minutes so i'm just going to keep streaming okay uh land rover says what's react used for for building web apps you can also use it for native apps and other things uh ventilis is where should i start learning coding uh free code camp let's see harsha says now i get that while you're getting build errors you're not you're not shutting down the next js development server so files are busy in the file system and messing things up ah okay let's see if this works then oh okay so phoenix says when the there are more posts you will have to click to expand so the hover effect all right that that's actually perfect so if that's going to be the case then i'd say yeah for sure keep the hover effect michael creo says how do you handle it when you get 200 likes on a tweet my phone is blowing up and it's getting annoying i don't know if i've ever had 200 likes on a tweet so i don't know how to handle it evan says just got here where do you go for daily code challenges i actually i don't sometimes i'll go to free code camp and do stuff looks like i'm still getting errors um otherwise i don't really do the daily code challenges jeju says hello change your theme um joe says can you make a project so we can learn um maybe maybe like on my channel i'll do something like that at some point if i get time gaurav says you can share the list of podcasts on twitter okay and maybe i'll do that joe says can you help me or else get a coding job with no degree yeah i'd say definitely try to go through the free coding camp free code camp lessons uh there are a lot of people that have gotten jobs like that harsha says what are you using for that meeting look up i'm not sure what you're saying i'm not sure what that refers to michael says that was a humble brag on my part all right cool i think yeah i definitely want to finish the chat up now um in case my meeting does start on time i don't want to be late for that because that's my boss and my boss's boss are both going to be in there um so yes i'm gonna finish up but thank you all so much for watching uh it looks like we had a lot of new people and uh so i hope you liked it if there's anything i can do to improve the streams please let me know definitely welcome criticism and um oh harshit wanted to know how i knew other people were meeting because i asked one of my uh coworkers on slack but yeah so anyway thanks again i'm gonna try to stream again this week if i can i want to try to get back into like regular times for streaming and yeah so hopefully i'll see you all soon until then have a great day
