00:00 - today we're going to talk about analog
00:01 - versus digital on a really basic level
00:04 - most specifically we're going to talk
00:06 - about how computers interpret an analog
00:08 - sound and turned it into a digital file
00:11 - an analog sound wave would look
00:13 - something like this this would be like a
00:14 - perfect S Wave which would not really
00:16 - ever be heard in nature but that's
00:17 - beside the point this analog sound wave
00:21 - the computer takes that and measures at
00:23 - all these different
00:24 - points measures those and turns those
00:27 - into numbers based on this point right
00:29 - here so we go up and say oh this is 27
00:32 - and this is 016 and this is
00:34 - 1.2 later the computer could take those
00:37 - numbers and reinterpret them and turn
00:39 - them into actual sound again we're also
00:42 - going to discuss a little bit of data
00:44 - compression how computers compress data
00:47 - that is in a sound file an image file or
00:49 - a video file now the benefit of
00:51 - compression is that it's a smaller file
00:53 - so it's easier to store it takes up less
00:55 - space and it's easier to send to
00:57 - somebody else one of the ways this is
00:58 - done in sound is is it would take it
01:00 - less often the sampling would be every
01:02 - two or every three another way is that
01:05 - it would just go up to here and say okay
01:07 - this is .27 well we're just going to
01:09 - measure everything from here so it's -3
01:12 - -21 from there if everything was around
01:15 - that same area in images this is done by
01:18 - taking the little tiniest possible
01:20 - pixels and just measuring it in groups
01:22 - of 16 and finding kind of the average
01:24 - color of that the most important thing
01:26 - to take away from this video is you're
01:28 - going to want to use digital files
01:29 - they're going to have a better quality
01:31 - and when you're looking at compression
01:32 - you really need to look at how far
01:34 - you're willing to go to ensure that the
01:35 - user still has the best experience
