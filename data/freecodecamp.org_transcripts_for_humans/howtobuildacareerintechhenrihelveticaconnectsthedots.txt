11:20 - your patience we are here we're up and
11:22 - running i am so excited to bring you the
11:24 - first in a series of interviews uh with
11:27 - me jason langstor if i run learn with
11:29 - jason in partnership with free code camp
11:31 - thank you so much for letting us take
11:33 - over the channel and i am just
11:35 - absolutely thrilled to be talking to one
11:36 - of my favorite people today henri
11:38 - elvetica how are you doing man
11:40 - honestly i'm probably more thrilled to
11:43 - be here uh after that little bit of
11:45 - hiccup
11:46 - uh for everyone uh just watching uh
11:49 - apologies were a little tardy it's all
11:51 - on me uh my computer was just acting
11:54 - weird and you know what i just
11:56 - discovered today is that the touch id is
11:59 - actually a button as well so i was
12:02 - sitting there touching it touching it
12:06 - and then i was getting so mad that i was
12:09 - like wait this just went down i'm like
12:10 - oh man i didn't know this oh so
12:14 - uh regardless thanks for having me dude
12:16 - uh i think it's a it's an honor for you
12:18 - to first have reached out to me and uh
12:21 - finding out that i'm the first person uh
12:23 - uh sort of like launching uh this set of
12:26 - uh interviews so i'm just beyond
12:28 - delighted i mean i'll go a step further
12:30 - than that man i i actually will say that
12:32 - you are the person who kind of inspired
12:34 - the whole idea for this um and we'll
12:36 - talk a little bit more about why here
12:39 - when we get into it but so what i what i
12:41 - really want to do is i just want to say
12:43 - um you know the the idea behind this
12:46 - whole series and the reason that we're
12:47 - doing it is that getting into tech can
12:50 - be really daunting right it can be um it
12:52 - can feel like this endless climb like
12:54 - you you're just kind of rolling this
12:55 - rock up the hill and you never know when
12:57 - it's going to stop and
12:59 - what i what i'm hoping to do is to to
13:01 - help encourage people and and um kind of
13:04 - show that like even if you haven't been
13:06 - working in tech you're still actively
13:09 - building skills that are going to help
13:10 - you in your career that are going to
13:11 - help you uh move forward so where i want
13:14 - to start with that is is let's maybe
13:16 - start by talking a little bit about what
13:17 - you're doing now so do you want to maybe
13:20 - share a little bit of
13:21 - what what does your career look like now
13:24 - certainly um i mean i i've certainly not
13:27 - uh reached i'd say the the sort of
13:30 - zenith or apex of my career so far in
13:33 - tech but i'm happy to share um i mean
13:37 - i'm
13:38 - what you would regard as your sort of
13:39 - prototypical freelancer uh
13:42 - and uh i probably take that freelancing
13:45 - a step further uh in a sense that i may
13:48 - have my hands in a bunch of different
13:50 - things
13:51 - but that's also because i feel that i
13:54 - also
13:55 - have a set of skills that sort of
14:00 - allow me to do so uh essentially so uh i
14:03 - came from a design firm you know classic
14:05 - uh
14:06 - you know you know being on the dev team
14:08 - et cetera et cetera uh and then i
14:10 - discovered uh
14:12 - i mean sort of the inner layers of the
14:14 - the tech the tech scene and yeah i saw
14:17 - you know the conferencing and i saw the
14:20 - ability to do like some some tech
14:22 - writing and stuff like that and i was
14:23 - like oh this is actually kind of
14:24 - interesting
14:26 - and um having done freelancing uh quite
14:29 - often uh uh man sorry my notifications
14:33 - are getting crazy
14:34 - they're making all this noise
14:36 - but uh having done freelancing in a
14:38 - bunch of uh
14:39 - in prior careers uh i was very much used
14:41 - to it you know uh and uh so it was no
14:45 - you know uh it wasn't complicated to
14:47 - really transition to a freelance
14:50 - environment so uh
14:52 - after that i just you know even you know
14:54 - discovering the opportunity to be an
14:56 - organizer you know something that i've
14:58 - done previously as well uh
15:01 - which is absolutely part of the fold uh
15:03 - for me now anyhow so uh yeah i mean like
15:06 - the freelance title uh tends to be a
15:08 - little boring
15:09 - you know uh but uh you know when i sit
15:12 - down and with people let them know what
15:14 - i do specifically what i enjoy doing
15:17 - specifically uh then you know i start to
15:19 - have this sort of like
15:21 - multi-faceted uh many hats type of uh
15:24 - uh title
15:26 - yeah yeah and actually so that's
15:28 - something that i think is really
15:29 - interesting about your career in
15:30 - particular is that you are a many hats
15:34 - kind of developer because you work you
15:35 - do contract and client work um you
15:38 - organize the jam stack toronto meetup
15:40 - you're a keynote speaker you uh you make
15:43 - like swag you've got the the hip-hop
15:46 - pins which i have i have some of those
15:47 - sitting around here actually oh man i i
15:49 - may have some no where do they go i i
15:52 - have but you've got like the ll cool js
15:54 - and the notorious big data and like all
15:56 - these amazing these amazing pins um and
15:59 - so you're you're kind of across the
16:01 - board and what i love about it is that
16:04 - you you have done something that i think
16:07 - is is really interesting
16:08 - in your career which is that you haven't
16:10 - allowed
16:12 - what you do to box you in
16:14 - to a certain set of roles or
16:16 - responsibilities and i think that's
16:17 - really inspiring and that's that's kind
16:19 - of what i was thinking about when we
16:21 - started talking about this show
16:22 - so specifically um what i'd love to talk
16:25 - about a little bit is
16:27 - you don't have a traditional tech
16:29 - background like you didn't come in
16:30 - through a computer science college
16:31 - program or anything like that so what
16:34 - were you doing before tech
16:36 - so uh
16:38 - i mean
16:39 - it's uh it's absolutely true i did not
16:41 - come from you know anything cs related
16:44 - uh i was always curious about you know
16:46 - cs or computers in general you know i i
16:49 - fiddled around as a young man
16:51 - uh
16:52 - younger men because i am still a young
16:54 - man
16:55 - but uh yeah it uh let me see i started
17:00 - i'd say i mean ultimately i came from
17:02 - music you know if i really uh go digging
17:05 - pretty deep um
17:08 - you know in college uh i did i remember
17:11 - doing uh college radio you know and i
17:14 - had my own little show whatever
17:16 - and um i also had like a part-time job
17:20 - and i say college college slash
17:21 - university uh but i also had a part-time
17:24 - job at a uh
17:26 - a record chain
17:28 - and uh yeah i mean i enjoyed it and uh
17:32 - that led ultimately to working at a
17:35 - label
17:36 - and uh as you may or may not remember
17:39 - because i know
17:40 - i'm sure you do remember but you know
17:42 - we've talked about our sort of parallel
17:44 - paths and whatnot in music but you tend
17:47 - to be around that sort of traffic where
17:49 - you know label execs come in you know
17:51 - reps uh you know they have you know swag
17:55 - or whatever promos and that sort of
17:58 - brought me into the business side of
18:00 - music which
18:02 - i loved
18:03 - uh i may not love as much as i did back
18:06 - then
18:07 - but uh i absolutely loved the the sort
18:09 - of the marketing uh the the development
18:13 - of careers the development of acts uh
18:15 - and stuff like that so
18:17 - that really enabled me to
18:20 - you know do so many things um
18:24 - you know being in touch with you know
18:26 - groups of people all the time uh you
18:29 - know
18:30 - people you don't know necessarily but
18:32 - you know you you get to know eventually
18:34 - and you know creating creating a network
18:37 - of people across sometimes a country if
18:39 - not a continent you know and these were
18:42 - you know things that we did in in in
18:43 - music marketing you know sort of being
18:45 - able to pick up the phone or send an
18:47 - email to a particular you know retailer
18:50 - if not you know radio person and and
18:52 - talk about you know some of your your
18:54 - sort of priorities at the time so i
18:56 - definitely did uh quite a bit of a time
18:59 - in music and at some point uh in
19:02 - parallel i started to work in fashion as
19:04 - well
19:05 - because an opportunity came up and
19:08 - neither clashed with each other
19:10 - on a scheduling level
19:12 - and certainly not on a content level
19:15 - sure
19:16 - but
19:17 - back then
19:19 - it was prior to what i
19:22 - saw
19:23 - happening after which was uh the sort of
19:25 - like meeting of two minds the fusing of
19:27 - those two uh industries you know fashion
19:30 - and music suddenly uh working well
19:32 - together hand-in-hand so
19:35 - and and that was also another
19:36 - opportunity uh that i took i took on
19:40 - because that taught me a lot you know
19:42 - and i did a bit more of the sales thing
19:44 - there but there was still heavy
19:46 - marketing going on
19:47 - and like i said the music was starting
19:49 - to fuse in with fashion and i worked
19:51 - with a label a clothing label that was
19:55 - very forward on that level as well
19:57 - yeah
19:58 - so so kind of talking about like so you
20:01 - you've worked in in music you've worked
20:03 - in fashion uh you you got into a design
20:05 - agency
20:06 - um
20:07 - one of the things that i've i've noticed
20:09 - is like just kind of from my own career
20:11 - uh
20:12 - a lot of the skills that have helped me
20:14 - progress have been
20:16 - more on the the kind of social side and
20:19 - you said something that i thought was
20:20 - really interesting which was about
20:22 - building that global network right and
20:23 - so i remember when i was in a band one
20:25 - of the hardest parts of being in a band
20:27 - wasn't getting up on stage it was
20:29 - convincing a group of 16 year old kids
20:31 - in a city i'd never been to to go print
20:33 - out and hang up flyers for our show
20:35 - right so what kind of skills do you feel
20:39 - you developed in in fashion in in music
20:43 - that have that you use all the time that
20:44 - you maybe thought would not be
20:47 - particularly useful at the time
20:48 - oh
20:49 - you know great question and
20:52 - you know i've actually thought about
20:54 - this prior and uh
20:57 - i i may have i've mentioned this to you
20:59 - but you know ultimately i think i
21:01 - probably will make my way over to like a
21:04 - devrel position
21:06 - in tech
21:07 - but i tell people all the time you know
21:09 - when i sort of bring up the music bit
21:11 - that i felt like i was dev railing in
21:13 - music
21:14 - before i knew what the you know the the
21:17 - devrel title
21:18 - in a sense that
21:21 - you know
21:21 - you first you know you do a bit of a
21:23 - reconnaissance mission like okay i'm in
21:26 - this industry who do i need to know who
21:28 - do i need to talk to what they did what
21:30 - do they do uh that is part of my you
21:34 - know potential potential work mandate
21:36 - right
21:37 - and so you know you reach out to them
21:39 - you know cold emails sometimes but often
21:41 - enough it's like you know they know of
21:43 - your company so they're like oh yeah no
21:45 - doubt you know blah blah blah you get in
21:47 - touch and and you start that way
21:50 - and you know that could be a national uh
21:53 - situation but it could easily be
21:55 - international right right right and and
21:58 - you know again you know like you said as
22:00 - a as a someone who's in a band
22:03 - you know you know you have like 10 tour
22:05 - dates and you have to set up these dates
22:07 - with you know uh
22:10 - you know some marketing and some radio
22:12 - appearances and you know so that means
22:14 - like you know you know prior to zooming
22:18 - uh you have to make that phone calls
22:19 - like hey
22:21 - x y and z i'm coming to town yeah
22:23 - you know can i do a a 15-minute phoner
22:27 - right well and what you're and what
22:29 - you're talking about like really is
22:31 - that's a that's an overlap with project
22:34 - management that's an overlap with with
22:36 - like product minded thinking because you
22:38 - can't just say look one of the things
22:40 - that i think it gets a lot of devs in
22:42 - trouble is they think that the only part
22:43 - of the job is the code um and and
22:46 - because of that they get a little bit
22:47 - stuck where they write code but they're
22:49 - not thinking about how the code connects
22:50 - to the rest of the product of to the
22:52 - rest of the company to the people that
22:54 - are using it and that kind of lets you
22:57 - you plateau at a certain point where you
22:58 - can't really push beyond and so what
23:00 - you're talking about with this like you
23:02 - know it's not just playing music it's
23:04 - not just doing the show there's all this
23:06 - stuff connected around it and so you had
23:08 - to develop all these skills of thinking
23:10 - big picture and thinking about how one
23:13 - part would connect to another part how
23:14 - you could support the work that you were
23:15 - doing on this on stage with different
23:18 - things
23:19 - and i think that's that's just
23:20 - absolutely fascinating and such an
23:22 - interesting thing because who would have
23:23 - thought that being a show promoter
23:25 - would help
23:26 - help you become a better developer right
23:29 - absolutely and you know it's uh i mean
23:31 - again we've talked about this before
23:33 - i've told you like i i enjoy daydreaming
23:36 - you know
23:37 - i like to sit down and just sort of you
23:39 - know take an idea and start to develop
23:42 - it you know from start to finish
23:44 - good ideas poor ones but you know i jot
23:47 - them all down and i look for
23:49 - opportunities to
23:50 - you know take a product whatever it is
23:53 - and finding out how i can sort of
23:56 - develop it
23:57 - so for example
23:59 - you know in music as you remember it's
24:00 - like okay we'll get the advance okay
24:02 - what does the music sound like all right
24:04 - cool who do i need to reach out to to
24:07 - sort of you know see this music to uh
24:10 - get some feedback all right cool i got
24:12 - some feedback now i'm potentially going
24:14 - to go to radio with it boom boom boom
24:16 - here's my priority here's the product
24:19 - that i'm working with
24:20 - you know
24:21 - let me know what your community says
24:23 - once you put that out there and then you
24:26 - take that feedback and you know it's
24:28 - pretty much the same with software you
24:29 - know
24:30 - you know you might deploy something
24:32 - you're working on it you have an alpha
24:33 - you have a beta boom boom you put it out
24:35 - to uh a few people get some feedback
24:38 - what went wrong okay cool take it back
24:41 - and then at some point you could put out
24:43 - you know 1.0
24:45 - right yeah it's that whole like 10 years
24:47 - to an overnight success thing right
24:49 - absolutely absolutely you know so it
24:51 - certainly
24:52 - taught me how to think a lot um
24:55 - i don't say that i think differently but
24:57 - i do believe that you know having come
24:59 - from music and as you know we have to be
25:03 - thrift
25:04 - you know we have to make we have to you
25:07 - know take a dollar and stretch it like
25:10 - from here to who knows where like i'm in
25:12 - toronto i need to stretch this dollar to
25:14 - vancouver and back you know yeah
25:16 - absolutely
25:17 - it's uh we we tend to sort of really be
25:20 - uh you know potentially a bit more
25:21 - enterprising than most right
25:24 - yeah
25:24 - so um and that actually kind of has me
25:26 - thinking about maybe some more more
25:29 - practical stuff so for the the people
25:30 - who are watching a lot of folks are
25:32 - trying to break in they're trying to get
25:33 - their first role
25:35 - um
25:36 - so for the people who are in that
25:37 - position you know going back to how you
25:40 - made that transition when you when you
25:42 - were coming from from music and fashion
25:44 - over into tech
25:46 - what what did you do and like how did
25:48 - you
25:49 - how did you make yourself stand out from
25:51 - the other applicants how did you
25:54 - actually let's start there how did you
25:56 - make yourself stand out from other
25:57 - people as you were as you were trying to
25:58 - get that first gig
26:00 - so uh i mean even beyond the gig
26:04 - um i i'd like to talk about this like
26:06 - sort of in general sure uh but um i've
26:10 - always said that uh you know
26:14 - there are a lot of people who are uh
26:16 - equally skilled you know you're always
26:18 - gonna find that there are some musicians
26:20 - who are just like
26:22 - man you know
26:24 - he's a good guitarist you know
26:27 - his drums are you know whatever but
26:30 - at some point this is like little je ne
26:33 - sais quoi that makes you stand out
26:35 - and
26:36 - um you know coming from the arts
26:39 - uh it could have been a bunch of things
26:41 - uh
26:42 - but you know i made sure that you know i
26:45 - came with a bit of a different flair uh
26:47 - and i'm not talking about like you know
26:49 - i got feathers coming out my hat or
26:50 - whatever but you know i i i do want to
26:53 - make sure that you know you're going to
26:55 - remember me no matter what happens right
26:57 - um so
26:59 - you know on the work level you know my
27:01 - first gig in dev uh was
27:04 - you know i knew people you know and i
27:06 - knew uh someone who had uh mentioned
27:09 - that a particular company that they're
27:11 - working with were looking to fill in
27:12 - this role
27:14 - and you know i was lucky enough to
27:16 - uh make it to the top of the pile of of
27:19 - applicants and you know i got through
27:22 - yeah it's all good
27:23 - um but you know to me i i've always
27:26 - mentioned this and it's you know what's
27:28 - going to make you interesting you know
27:31 - and this is something i talk about
27:32 - sometimes in these these lunch and
27:34 - learns that i do you know like you know
27:36 - you go out there and find your passion
27:38 - and and sort of work at it right and
27:40 - i'll be very frank in the sort of like
27:43 - freelancer role and and sort of like
27:45 - this whole developer scene right now um
27:49 - i think a bunch of things happened um
27:52 - for what you know this may seem like you
27:55 - know
27:57 - such a small thing uh and bizarre thing
28:00 - to mention but i was like how you how
28:02 - are you not gonna forget me
28:04 - and the first thing was like my my
28:06 - twitter handle
28:08 - uh and
28:10 - you know i used to get asked so much if
28:12 - it was my real name i was
28:14 - like this is like they're not forgetting
28:17 - me right right
28:20 - i mean there's been discussion about it
28:21 - in the in the chat today about your
28:23 - about helvetica is your last name so
28:25 - that's that's like a developer stage
28:27 - name right
28:29 - it's a known plume absolutely you know
28:31 - it's not my real name but you know
28:32 - people gravitated towards it so much
28:35 - that i was like okay when i went to
28:36 - conferences i just asked them to to use
28:39 - this as my my uh my name
28:42 - and you know there are a couple reasons
28:43 - beyond that i could get into but you
28:45 - know that was one and two what i also
28:48 - did was uh you know when i was sort of
28:50 - you know a nobody
28:52 - and i'm just a bit
28:54 - less of a nobody right now
28:56 - but i'm still a bit of a nobody but you
29:00 - know i remember just uh you know the
29:02 - things i got into i just started to read
29:04 - about and i used to start to tweet about
29:06 - it and if i could i'd i'd sort of tag
29:09 - the the author and be like hey you know
29:11 - i really love this quote boom and you
29:14 - know i'll just put that out there also
29:15 - to sort of help myself but to really
29:17 - just build this this rapport with the
29:19 - community to let them know like this is
29:21 - what i'm into and you know if you go
29:23 - through my timeline you're going to see
29:25 - a lot more of this
29:27 - i remember running into some authors
29:28 - later who told me they loved it you know
29:31 - they loved seeing someone reading about
29:34 - their work and quoting it to the rest of
29:36 - the world
29:37 - and
29:38 - i heard that from authors i heard that
29:40 - from other developers who just started
29:41 - to follow me just on that basis yeah um
29:45 - and you know that also meant that i was
29:47 - starting to deep dive in these areas
29:48 - that i was into as well
29:50 - and so deep diving sharing my passions
29:53 - uh
29:54 - making sure that people would remember
29:56 - me uh and then you know things start to
29:59 - happen slowly thereafter
30:01 - yeah it well and it seems like i think a
30:03 - lot of people think that you have to
30:04 - know everything um and you know i i
30:07 - think that
30:08 - maybe a a sign of of growing in your
30:10 - career is realizing that there's just no
30:12 - way you're never gonna know everything
30:14 - um but i think maybe the surprising
30:15 - thing is that you can you can really
30:18 - specialize and there's a lot of work
30:19 - there like for example you are a um like
30:22 - an image performance specialist you're
30:24 - you've got one of the you're like one of
30:26 - the people i see do the most
30:28 - uh content about this right and that
30:31 - that brings you work right
30:33 - so you know i i never want to use
30:36 - specialists as a sort of like uh
30:39 - you know title uh sure
30:41 - certainly aficionado uh i enjoy the
30:44 - conversation i enjoy hearing about it uh
30:47 - i mean there are some speakers out there
30:48 - or you know some engineers uh some
30:51 - researchers in in the the uh sort of
30:54 - like images and the rendering scene that
30:57 - they don't speak a lot but when they do
30:59 - i enjoy you know i take time out of my
31:02 - day to make sure that i'm i'm available
31:04 - to see their talk you know
31:06 - like people like uh cornell zinski he
31:08 - doesn't speak a lot but i remember a
31:10 - couple years ago when he was at perth
31:11 - now i was like
31:12 - you know the minute the videos were
31:14 - available i was right there watching it
31:16 - absolutely
31:17 - so yes you know you tend to i mean you
31:20 - need to project what people want to see
31:21 - right so uh you know
31:24 - if you're going to be a jerk project
31:26 - that you're a jerk
31:28 - yeah you got to get that gordon ramsay
31:30 - energy going exactly
31:33 - but but you know i i start to read a lot
31:36 - about uh web performance in general you
31:39 - know i start to attend the web
31:40 - performance meetup which is uh one of
31:42 - the meetups that i run now uh and i just
31:44 - started to share some of the information
31:46 - whatever i had and i would follow you
31:49 - know a lot of the uh
31:50 - the leaders in that field uh the
31:54 - you know
31:55 - they in turn shared some of their info
31:58 - and it's just like you know more for me
32:00 - to ingest and and sort of like
32:02 - voraciously sort of uh devour
32:05 - so
32:06 - um but yeah you know it
32:09 - i i'm a big believer that uh whatever it
32:12 - is that you're into you know maybe
32:13 - you're a css person or you're getting
32:15 - into css you know
32:17 - share some of the css knowledge you have
32:19 - share
32:20 - you know some of the stuff that you're
32:21 - reading out there
32:23 - and people then potentially ask you
32:24 - questions you may or may not have the
32:26 - answers but you start that conversation
32:28 - with them and they'll be like oh yeah
32:30 - that that person like you know i love
32:32 - that they share css or just a lot of
32:35 - front-end stuff and you know i can ask
32:37 - them or you know i know i'll get like
32:38 - some nuggets from them at some point
32:40 - mm-hmm
32:41 - so there's actually there's a related
32:42 - question that i want to dig into scott
32:44 - uh in the chat is asking so when you're
32:46 - learning this stuff
32:48 - how do you show that you know what
32:49 - you're talking about like especially in
32:51 - the context of of going in and applying
32:53 - for jobs
32:55 - i mean uh you can mention that in in
32:58 - some of your uh
33:00 - you know uh in your resume or cover
33:03 - letter or something like that or you may
33:05 - have you know a repo where you're sort
33:07 - of like playing around with some some
33:09 - content and and you're showing some of
33:11 - the results uh or you may have like a
33:13 - code pen where you've sort of laid out
33:15 - these sort of code blocks these examples
33:17 - of you working on on on a particular
33:20 - item that you know was puzzling to you
33:22 - at first but you're like okay i kind of
33:24 - get it now but you leave it there out in
33:26 - the open for the public to see and
33:28 - consume
33:30 - that's something that i'm very adamant
33:31 - about which is uh
33:34 - being public with your work and i'm not
33:36 - saying that you absolutely have to do it
33:38 - but if you
33:40 - do
33:40 - you'd be surprised because this is
33:43 - working on your behalf
33:45 - while you sleep right right right um i
33:48 - mean i wish i wish i pulled up the
33:50 - example um actually in fact there's so
33:53 - many links i want to carry uh for this
33:55 - uh for this uh
33:57 - talk but
33:58 - we'll make sure they show up in the the
34:00 - notes on the video so we'll we'll post
34:02 - some resources on the video for the
34:03 - replay if for anybody who's watching now
34:05 - or if you're watching
34:06 - uh the replay later on uh that'd be
34:08 - great i mean i could give you an example
34:10 - where i remember uh someone had just
34:12 - mentioned that they're looking for an
34:14 - internship um
34:16 - you know
34:17 - uh
34:18 - they're gonna be this is last year
34:20 - obviously they're going to be free and
34:21 - whatnot they're ready for the summer and
34:24 - um
34:25 - oh man what am i why am i forgetting his
34:27 - name ceo of shopify
34:30 - oh yeah i know who you're talking about
34:32 - i also yes toby yes he
34:35 - basically went to this person's github
34:38 - looked through it came back and offered
34:41 - them to spot the job on the spot you
34:43 - know in a queen he was like hey so and
34:45 - so i just went through github it looks
34:48 - great i love what you did here if you're
34:50 - trying to intern with us i got you right
34:52 - now this is not hr this is the ceo right
34:55 - so um i've always said you'd be
34:57 - surprised what can happen when you're
34:59 - public with your work sharing some of
35:00 - that some of that uh
35:03 - stuff you're working on i'll give you
35:04 - another example a really good friend of
35:06 - mine hussein jorday who's over at google
35:08 - right now he used to be at this company
35:09 - in toronto and he had been working on i
35:13 - think uh
35:14 - a pwa uh
35:17 - i can't remember which one but
35:21 - uh adios money got wind of it online and
35:25 - was looking through it and
35:27 - was like hey dude like i'd love to work
35:28 - with you on this and
35:31 - essentially
35:32 - they start to both work on this project
35:34 - a few months later
35:37 - a position opened up over google
35:40 - and he asked this gentleman my boy
35:42 - hussein to apply
35:44 - and you know the application process
35:46 - took place and he was able to join
35:48 - google so again this is the idea of
35:51 - being public which you work with which
35:52 - will at least get you a look
35:55 - and then you know things can go from
35:57 - there
35:58 - well and i love that whole idea right
36:00 - because i'm thinking through you know
36:02 - how
36:03 - how i've ended up working with some of
36:05 - the people that i work with and and
36:07 - sometimes it's because we we pulled a
36:10 - resume out of the stack but a lot of
36:11 - times it's because we have prior
36:13 - positive experiences with the people and
36:16 - we look for their resume in the stack
36:18 - and
36:19 - that comes from anything that comes from
36:22 - somebody that every time we talk to him
36:23 - on twitter it makes us smile somebody
36:25 - who is always helpful in a community
36:27 - forum somebody who is part of the
36:29 - communities that we run in who is just
36:32 - always helpful and supportive and making
36:33 - people feel like you know they can do it
36:37 - and just somebody who you can see doing
36:38 - the work like there are people who are
36:40 - early in their careers and i see them
36:42 - they're writing articles they're they're
36:44 - sharing their works in progress they've
36:46 - got those code pens they're seeing what
36:48 - somebody brilliant like like cassie
36:50 - evans will do this amazing svg animation
36:53 - and they'll go and they'll fork it and
36:54 - they'll alter it they'll you know like i
36:56 - saw somebody did this yesterday cassie
36:58 - was at smashing com
36:59 - and she did a an animation of the
37:01 - smashing cat and somebody went and put a
37:03 - guitar on the cat right just like forked
37:06 - that added a guitar and now the cat
37:08 - rocks out and it's like what what a fun
37:10 - way to learn something show that you've
37:13 - done it and if you're consistent with
37:15 - that right and actually this is probably
37:16 - the thing that is maybe the most
37:18 - important and i'll let you talk about it
37:19 - because you and i have talked about this
37:20 - a lot but consistency continuing to show
37:24 - up like how big of a role has that
37:26 - played in in your career
37:28 - you know uh
37:31 - tremendous i and uh i mean before i get
37:34 - into that i want to actually bring up
37:36 - another example uh because you said
37:38 - something that made me think of it i was
37:40 - listening to a
37:42 - podcast
37:43 - you know this gentleman
37:45 - bdoggy
37:46 - [Music]
37:48 - jamstack radio yeah and if anyone wants
37:51 - to go and listen to the very last or the
37:55 - most recent one i think it's episode 65
37:58 - or 66
37:59 - and someone who is at a boot camp right
38:02 - now
38:04 - uh prior to going to the boot camp i had
38:07 - been super curious uh and you know
38:10 - started to poke around this actu this
38:12 - gentleman came from music in fact
38:14 - uh and he started to poke around you
38:16 - know uh i think python maybe
38:19 - but he really got into development
38:22 - and
38:23 - uh
38:24 - at the same time he was discovering you
38:26 - know the jam stack
38:28 - and i think he's been playing around
38:31 - with redwood js
38:33 - and so at the same time he was
38:37 - attending the boot camp which is still
38:39 - now i believe
38:41 - he had been in the redwood js slack sort
38:44 - of like having these conversations with
38:46 - them and you know talking about things
38:49 - he was he was discovering uh with the
38:51 - framework
38:53 - and you know i'm listening to this
38:55 - thinking like the minute this gentleman
38:57 - has done this program
38:58 - he's got work waiting for him yeah
39:00 - somewhere guaranteed and you know as i
39:03 - was listening to him i was like this is
39:04 - brilliant because it was his early
39:06 - involvement his early sort of public
39:09 - commitment to uh to working with this
39:13 - you know this framework and trying to
39:14 - figure out how it worked uh best
39:16 - practices and whatnot and just to hear
39:18 - him speak i was like well you know this
39:20 - guy's got this guy's got a job you know
39:22 - certainly coming out uh so i just want
39:25 - to mention that so if anyone want to go
39:26 - back and listen to that podcast but
39:28 - getting back to your question which was
39:30 - you remind me again uh about consistency
39:33 - showing up oh yeah absolutely um
39:36 - i mean there are certain situations
39:37 - where you almost have no choice but to
39:39 - show up
39:40 - and you know i think that i've put
39:42 - myself that position in a sense that you
39:44 - know as a freelancer you have to poke
39:45 - around to see who's doing what
39:47 - uh
39:48 - who's writing what uh keep that in mind
39:51 - uh also the idea of you know as an
39:54 - organizer uh you're also
39:58 - looking for people who have interests in
40:00 - the field so that you're forced again to
40:03 - see
40:04 - uh who's writing what who's speaking
40:06 - where what was the talk about uh and
40:08 - this is all information that you take in
40:11 - so
40:12 - the only way you find these things out
40:14 - is is if you show up absolutely that's
40:16 - it
40:16 - um and you know
40:19 - again it's getting back to the music pic
40:21 - right you know it can be at times you're
40:23 - like oh man i really want to stay home
40:25 - tonight right you know i don't want to
40:26 - go see this bed because i've been out
40:29 - three days this week and i would rather
40:31 - chill
40:32 - but
40:34 - you make it out you'll be there for like
40:35 - half hour 45 whatever and do what you
40:37 - have to do and come back i think it's a
40:39 - bit of the same you know yeah in certain
40:42 - roles in not all but certain roles uh
40:45 - being out there seeing who's talking
40:47 - about what
40:48 - knowing who to reach out to in case you
40:51 - need a particular question answered a
40:54 - group of people may be able to answer
40:56 - that question for you
40:58 - you know joining some slacks and you
41:00 - know you don't even have to necessarily
41:03 - engage everyone but watch the
41:06 - conversation that's taking place
41:08 - uh and a lot of times those are the
41:09 - nuggets
41:11 - absolutely well and and just to kind of
41:13 - you know to to expand on that even a
41:15 - little bit more something that i think
41:16 - is so
41:18 - interesting is like
41:19 - you can you can see when people
41:21 - consistently show up
41:23 - they they start to become
41:25 - part of a community instead of observers
41:28 - in a community and and one of the things
41:30 - that i've noticed is that like
41:32 - everything that i've done consistently
41:34 - is a thing that i now am able to do for
41:37 - work um and and so i think a little i
41:40 - think of it a little bit like
41:42 - every time that i do work even if it
41:43 - feels pointless even if it feels
41:46 - like i'd like it's not what i wanted to
41:47 - do you know like as you said i just want
41:49 - to stay home and chill if i if i show up
41:51 - and i do that work that's a vote toward
41:53 - making that who i become
41:55 - and i want to cast as many votes as i
41:58 - can toward the lifestyle that i want i i
42:00 - love
42:01 - being able to do this show and the only
42:03 - reason that quincy reached out to me
42:05 - that i'm on the free code cam channel
42:07 - right now is because i showed up twice a
42:10 - week for the last two years on learn
42:11 - with jason right and and that that was a
42:14 - vote for me being a video internet
42:17 - person right
42:19 - um but that's been true of all parts of
42:20 - my career with the you know the the
42:22 - development job now i have now nullify
42:24 - and and i i think that that just
42:27 - you know that it seems true for
42:29 - all of us you know and
42:30 - like we talked about earlier you don't
42:32 - just do
42:33 - development you you are all over the map
42:35 - you've got you know you're running a
42:36 - meetup you're running
42:38 - you you're running like a
42:39 - clothing brand you're running uh you're
42:42 - you're freelancing like your freelance
42:44 - consultancy like
42:45 - all of that stuff is happening because
42:47 - you're showing up and doing that work
42:49 - and you know what the the the pins and
42:51 - whatnot that was just an opportunity to
42:54 - sort of you know
42:56 - uh originally it was really it's a
42:58 - mixture of two things you know
42:59 - my background in music and yeah i used
43:02 - to list a lot of rap whatever although
43:04 - you know my range was like all over the
43:06 - place
43:07 - uh but
43:08 - you know i thought it would be a very
43:10 - interesting way of of you know breaking
43:13 - the ice when meeting people
43:15 - uh and you know sort of like you know
43:18 - it's like a peace offering it's like hey
43:20 - what's up i have these pins i hope you
43:21 - like them whatever and people are just
43:23 - like oh my god you know and so that was
43:26 - like more fun than anything but you know
43:28 - in terms of you know my my current sort
43:30 - of priorities certainly uh
43:33 - you know freelance development and in
43:35 - fact i told you i thought you know when
43:36 - i discovered you know i had a greater
43:39 - understanding what the jam stack was you
43:41 - know i think i told you i think i told
43:43 - uh
43:44 - phil
43:45 - i was like i think this is going to be
43:47 - huge you know especially for freelancers
43:50 - but
43:51 - i also you know my parents are retired
43:53 - teachers
43:54 - and you know when you're when you're
43:57 - young coming up you might look at your
43:58 - parents you're like yo my parents are
43:59 - awesome but
44:01 - i'm going to get some cooler work
44:04 - and i was just like teaching whatever
44:08 - but you know with age i i start to
44:10 - realize how important uh
44:13 - being a teacher was uh being a
44:16 - uh sort of like a figure that people
44:18 - could potentially look up to
44:20 - um
44:21 - and that just
44:23 - took over
44:24 - and you know that's where the the sort
44:27 - of the the fascination for meetups came
44:30 - from and and being able to create a
44:33 - platform for people to come in and shine
44:36 - you know uh to start their careers uh
44:40 - potentially with you know a lightning
44:42 - talk and then you know move that to a
44:45 - more sort of substantial 30 45 minute
44:47 - talk whatever and then letting that take
44:51 - them where where it may go
44:53 - and uh just because i've seen it
44:56 - uh and i think it's an opportunity also
44:59 - to bring my flair to that meetup
45:02 - ecosystem and you know it might not be
45:04 - the meet up that you used to you know
45:07 - you roll in the music will be different
45:09 - yeah well then the food might be
45:10 - different uh the emceeing might be a bit
45:14 - you know have a bit more flavor when and
45:16 - you just did like to to maybe paint a
45:18 - picture of this flavor a little bit you
45:20 - just did a whole like themed 11d event
45:23 - right uh yeah like so what was november
45:26 - 11th so 11 11. you started it at what
45:28 - time was it 11 11
45:30 - 11. and it was on 11d but you know what
45:34 - again it's an opportunity to spin uh
45:37 - a
45:38 - very detailed development platform into
45:41 - something that could be a bit more
45:42 - interesting uh just the theme alone and
45:45 - you know it's funny you should mention
45:47 - that and and you know i'll shout out the
45:49 - speakers but
45:50 - they
45:52 - helped in putting together what was a
45:55 - super interesting in my
45:57 - eyes event
45:59 - more people got you know even more
46:02 - interested uh once they understood what
46:04 - was going on and they're like oh it's
46:05 - lightning talk okay cool and we ended up
46:08 - getting some of the the best talks i've
46:10 - heard in quite a while in terms for sure
46:13 - as lightning talks because everyone had
46:15 - a detailed uh talk
46:17 - there was a fantastic talk by uh dan
46:21 - fascia
46:22 - on how he was living using 110 in a
46:25 - medical profession and i remember he had
46:27 - told me in the the back channels that
46:29 - that's what he was he was going to do
46:31 - and i was just like oh i can't wait for
46:33 - this i'm not belittling everyone else's
46:35 - talk but
46:37 - this is the idea that people can
46:39 - discover
46:41 - new things
46:42 - even though they believe they're like oh
46:44 - i kind of know how to liven your works
46:45 - and whatnot but it was just like
46:47 - mind-blowing yeah
46:49 - so i like to enable that sort of element
46:52 - that sort of discovery element that
46:55 - needs to happen at every step and and
46:57 - that's you know and that's what i think
46:58 - is is interesting and and one of the
47:00 - reasons that that i i love watching you
47:03 - work is that i can see you bringing the
47:05 - creativity from your your previous roles
47:09 - and trying to think about this stuff not
47:11 - as
47:11 - well it's a meetup it's a tech meetup it
47:13 - has to work like this and instead
47:15 - thinking of it as a it's a it's a
47:17 - gathering space we're going to bring
47:18 - people together and anytime people come
47:20 - together
47:21 - it can be
47:23 - stiff and very formal and and kind of
47:26 - impersonal or it can be wild you know
47:28 - like a house party is just an informal
47:31 - meetup right so how can we play with the
47:33 - format how can we make something that
47:35 - that doesn't just feel like the thing
47:37 - we've always done but something that
47:38 - feels unique something that's remarkable
47:40 - and i think that you have a unique
47:41 - talent for that um and i i would i would
47:44 - wager and you can confirm that this has
47:46 - played a pretty significant impact on on
47:48 - the connections you've been able to make
47:49 - and what that's been able to unlock for
47:51 - your career
47:52 - certainly you know and um
47:55 - i agree 200 with that you know and um
47:59 - [Music]
48:00 - i'll give you a quick story i remember
48:02 - uh when i was first coming in to the uh
48:06 - the environment the industry
48:08 - and someone had said you know you need
48:10 - to attend meetups because you know
48:12 - you're going to see and learn a lot of
48:13 - stuff i'm like alright cool whatever and
48:15 - he had mentioned this one particular
48:16 - meetup to attend they happen to be
48:18 - friends of his but i was like okay
48:21 - whatever and i walked in
48:23 - and i remember this like it was
48:25 - yesterday i walked in i looked around it
48:28 - was packed
48:30 - and
48:31 - i was like okay this is really
48:33 - interesting and again you know you've
48:35 - had this hat on i've worn it obviously
48:38 - you know as people came from music a
48:41 - full room to us is like gold you know
48:44 - because we've had those ones that were
48:45 - yeah you know very you know sparsely
48:49 - attended
48:50 - uh but that's just because we think like
48:53 - so far ahead sometimes you know
48:55 - but i remember you know sitting down and
48:58 - listening to the meetup and watching all
49:00 - the speakers and watching the organizers
49:02 - sort of do the thing and you know i
49:04 - paint a few of them i'm like guys this
49:06 - is really good but here are three things
49:08 - that i think could be improved
49:11 - and you know instead of just you know
49:13 - peanut gallery
49:15 - you know blah blah blah this this could
49:17 - be improved and just walk away
49:18 - i literally stepped to the organizers
49:20 - i'm like hey gentlemen
49:22 - you know this is great this is an
49:24 - amazing audience but i think this could
49:26 - improve
49:28 - and i immediately start to share some of
49:30 - my ideas and you know they told me there
49:32 - after i mean later on they're like you
49:34 - know when you came up you know and start
49:36 - to criticize us but
49:37 - we're kind of like hey you know here's
49:39 - some ideas there can like who's this guy
49:41 - you know
49:42 - i ended up joining them and i helped
49:45 - them sort of like develop uh you know
49:48 - better ideas uh and things that i
49:50 - thought could be interesting because
49:52 - again you have to look at a particular
49:53 - topic and be like
49:55 - okay
49:56 - this is cool but i think it would sound
49:58 - better if we said this and then we can
50:01 - go out and get this type of you know uh
50:04 - speaker uh
50:06 - yeah i mean i i think there are so many
50:08 - opportunities in tech right now to do uh
50:12 - really interesting things despite the
50:14 - fact that we are pretty much online all
50:17 - the time now
50:18 - um
50:19 - it just might take that extra glass of
50:21 - prosecco to really let your mind wander
50:24 - and and expand on this idea because i
50:26 - think uh you know some of the best ideas
50:29 - are hiding in in sort of plain sight
50:32 - you know i think there's a
50:34 - levity thing i was just sitting right
50:36 - there and because i remember i was
50:37 - reading something about levity and i'm
50:39 - like wait what's today's date and i
50:41 - looked at my watch i'm like wait
50:42 - november 11th is coming up i'm like 11
50:45 - is really buzzing
50:47 - and i'm like i know some 118 developers
50:50 - okay let me reach out i reached out to
50:51 - them
50:52 - and they're like dude this sounds pretty
50:54 - interesting i'm like all right let's do
50:55 - it and you know we did a broad daylight
50:57 - and it was awesome
50:59 - yeah i think i mean it's it's so much
51:01 - fun uh like i've said to to watch you
51:04 - work it because you you do bring that
51:06 - kind of fresh perspective you you do
51:08 - interesting things that don't follow the
51:10 - standard format um and it's you know
51:13 - it's it's one of the reasons that when
51:15 - i'm thinking of how do we put together
51:17 - something fun how do we put together
51:18 - something different you're one of the
51:19 - first people that comes to mind for that
51:21 - um thank you and and i've i really love
51:24 - to see that so we're we're down coming
51:26 - down to the end here so let's make this
51:28 - a little more
51:29 - practical for the people watching right
51:30 - now absolutely um
51:32 - what
51:33 - what would you recommend both as as
51:36 - learning practices
51:37 - and as community practices like if
51:40 - somebody was going to adopt one or two
51:42 - habits today what should they start
51:44 - doing if they're trying to land that
51:45 - first gig
51:48 - i would say um
51:52 - okay
51:53 - so i believe there's a little bit more
51:56 - clutter right now
51:58 - and there are a lot of people trying to
52:00 - do the exact same thing you're doing
52:02 - which is land a job
52:05 - um
52:07 - i mean this is a bit of a two-parter so
52:10 - one prime i'm gonna one sorry i would
52:13 - say
52:14 - try not to stress it too much
52:18 - because i think a lot of people are you
52:20 - know they consider themselves ready at
52:22 - some point they're like okay where's the
52:23 - job where's the job where's the job you
52:25 - know how come i'm not getting any offers
52:28 - try not to sweat that too much
52:30 - but more importantly i think
52:33 - as you
52:34 - you know shop around
52:37 - stay active
52:39 - uh and you know to me that's the biggest
52:41 - part and staying active might mean
52:44 - uh
52:45 - something to one person and something
52:47 - else to some to to another one but
52:51 - you know if you
52:52 - do a lot of reading uh you know blogs or
52:56 - you know you're looking at you know uh i
52:58 - don't know uh tutorials and whatnot just
53:01 - keep going and and try to create this
53:04 - environment where people can see your
53:06 - work whether you're sharing this on
53:08 - twitter you have a github with or you
53:10 - have like a code pen you know shout outs
53:13 - to uh
53:15 - lintronix lin mm-hmm lennon
53:18 - yeah linotonic like her her one div
53:21 - thing is bananas that's so good
53:23 - like
53:24 - i don't know anything else about her but
53:26 - i just know she's you know she's a
53:28 - gangster with the css yeah i'm saying so
53:32 - share your stuff online you know again
53:34 - whether it be a codepen twitter or
53:36 - github
53:38 - and
53:38 - um
53:40 - i would say that's like a bit of a
53:42 - priority for me you know i mean and and
53:44 - a lot of people like oh well you know
53:46 - the resume this the resume that yeah
53:48 - that's totally cool but you know we're
53:50 - lucky enough that in this space
53:52 - at the very least the work that's out
53:54 - there that's public that's half your
53:56 - resume
53:57 - you know people are going to be like
53:58 - okay they know what they're doing here
54:00 - you know they'll go go ahead well i was
54:02 - going to say for a lot of developers
54:04 - like when when you send in your resume
54:06 - your resume is basically a list of links
54:08 - right and so you've got to build that
54:10 - list
54:12 - absolutely absolutely and you know
54:14 - thereafter it could be a few different
54:16 - things obviously uh you know you'd be
54:18 - surprised what you know being part of a
54:20 - community might lead to
54:22 - and that means you know if you get to
54:24 - know some people and opportunities come
54:26 - up these people might ring you down to
54:28 - be like hey
54:29 - uh just sent you a little dm let me know
54:31 - when you're ready i'd love to talk to
54:32 - you like for example
54:34 - you know and i'll i'll shout you out in
54:36 - public for this that time
54:38 - uh i heard from kraft
54:40 - uh cms oh yeah
54:42 - and you know
54:44 - it read like hey
54:46 - uh i'm from kraft
54:48 - uh jason sent me here and i was like
54:51 - okay
54:52 - you know and i'm pretty sure i was like
54:54 - you dude good luck you know and uh thank
54:57 - you very much for that but these these
54:59 - are the things that i'm talking about
55:00 - you know when opportunities come around
55:02 - someone might know you
55:04 - and say hey i i think this is coming
55:07 - down the pipe and uh i i you know
55:10 - this this sort of like this is your lane
55:12 - you know let me know what you think you
55:14 - know i'd love to set this up um i mean
55:17 - in fact right before we got on i was
55:19 - having this conversation with someone
55:21 - about
55:22 - potentially an opportunity early next
55:24 - year so
55:25 - i'm a big believer that you know being
55:28 - public with your work what you do
55:30 - and then you know being involved with
55:33 - the community
55:34 - and you know
55:35 - it won't go zero to 100 overnight
55:38 - but you'll see your network grow and and
55:41 - like you said if you're that person that
55:43 - people just love to see work and and and
55:46 - they smile when you're around it's like
55:48 - they're going to reach out to you as
55:49 - well
55:50 - absolutely i it's that's played such a
55:52 - big factor in my career as well you know
55:54 - after after i got i actually you know
55:57 - what even when nobody knew who i was the
55:59 - way i got my first job in tech is i went
56:01 - to the local coding meetup and i was in
56:04 - montana in missoula montana so this was
56:07 - 14 programmers none of us wrote the same
56:09 - language like i was a php dev there was
56:12 - one other php dev most of them were java
56:14 - we had you know it was like nobody was
56:16 - doing the same stuff but we just get
56:17 - together because we were the only
56:19 - programmers in town
56:21 - and through that we we became friends
56:24 - and i got referred to a job because they
56:27 - were a java dev and they were looking
56:28 - for php and i was the php dev so i got
56:31 - hooked up because i showed up to this
56:33 - meetup right and those those connections
56:36 - they might feel like nothing but they
56:38 - they start to form a fabric and you know
56:41 - that that referral led to me giving my
56:44 - first presentation at a meet-up led to
56:46 - me giving my first conference talk which
56:48 - led to more referrals and all of that
56:50 - has been the snowball that that got me
56:52 - to here and you know you you made a
56:55 - really good point about like not
56:56 - stressing at first because everybody's
56:58 - looking for their first job and it takes
57:00 - a long time to get started and it
57:01 - reminds me of a i wish i could remember
57:03 - who said this but
57:05 - there was a metaphor that i heard which
57:06 - is starting a career is like rolling a
57:09 - boulder it is really really really hard
57:12 - to get it to move that first inch
57:14 - but as soon as it starts to move it
57:16 - picks up momentum and after a while you
57:18 - can't stop it you're just moving and so
57:21 - you gotta you gotta stick with it you
57:22 - gotta show up and do that work every day
57:25 - to get that first inch um because it'll
57:27 - feel like nothing's happening and then
57:28 - it'll all happen at once
57:30 - um totally
57:31 - so henry man thank you so so much for
57:34 - hanging out with us this has been an
57:35 - absolute pleasure uh any final words for
57:38 - folks before we wrap this up oh man you
57:41 - know what um
57:43 - just you know wake up and and and you
57:45 - know smile you know it's uh i think
57:48 - there are a bunch of reasons especially
57:50 - now to to sort of like be bummed out but
57:53 - i think there's been literally no better
57:55 - time to to sort of like show your wares
57:58 - um
57:58 - and and be part of a community i mean
58:01 - and you'd mention the thing about
58:03 - speaking uh opportunities and that's
58:05 - something that i'm gonna work on in 2021
58:07 - for for uh all uh devs out there because
58:11 - um once upon a time you know you could
58:13 - be in toronto and not speak at the san
58:16 - francisco meetup but you can now yep you
58:19 - know so uh you literally have uh for
58:22 - anyone looking i think the opportunities
58:24 - have never been better to to to speak
58:27 - and as you said and i'll test as well i
58:30 - think uh from a lightning talk to a full
58:32 - talk i think speaking can do wonders for
58:35 - your career as well absolutely so henry
58:38 - where should people go if they want to
58:40 - keep up with you what uh what links
58:41 - would you recommend

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone thank you so much for your patience we are here we're up and running i am so excited to bring you the first in a series of interviews uh with me jason langstor if i run learn with jason in partnership with free code camp thank you so much for letting us take over the channel and i am just absolutely thrilled to be talking to one of my favorite people today henri elvetica how are you doing man honestly i'm probably more thrilled to be here uh after that little bit of hiccup uh for everyone uh just watching uh apologies were a little tardy it's all on me uh my computer was just acting weird and you know what i just discovered today is that the touch id is actually a button as well so i was sitting there touching it touching it and then i was getting so mad that i was like wait this just went down i'm like oh man i didn't know this oh so uh regardless thanks for having me dude uh i think it's a it's an honor for you to first have reached out to me and uh finding out that i'm the first person uh uh sort of like launching uh this set of uh interviews so i'm just beyond delighted i mean i'll go a step further than that man i i actually will say that you are the person who kind of inspired the whole idea for this um and we'll talk a little bit more about why here when we get into it but so what i what i really want to do is i just want to say um you know the the idea behind this whole series and the reason that we're doing it is that getting into tech can be really daunting right it can be um it can feel like this endless climb like you you're just kind of rolling this rock up the hill and you never know when it's going to stop and what i what i'm hoping to do is to to help encourage people and and um kind of show that like even if you haven't been working in tech you're still actively building skills that are going to help you in your career that are going to help you uh move forward so where i want to start with that is is let's maybe start by talking a little bit about what you're doing now so do you want to maybe share a little bit of what what does your career look like now certainly um i mean i i've certainly not uh reached i'd say the the sort of zenith or apex of my career so far in tech but i'm happy to share um i mean i'm what you would regard as your sort of prototypical freelancer uh and uh i probably take that freelancing a step further uh in a sense that i may have my hands in a bunch of different things but that's also because i feel that i also have a set of skills that sort of allow me to do so uh essentially so uh i came from a design firm you know classic uh you know you know being on the dev team et cetera et cetera uh and then i discovered uh i mean sort of the inner layers of the the tech the tech scene and yeah i saw you know the conferencing and i saw the ability to do like some some tech writing and stuff like that and i was like oh this is actually kind of interesting and um having done freelancing uh quite often uh uh man sorry my notifications are getting crazy they're making all this noise but uh having done freelancing in a bunch of uh in prior careers uh i was very much used to it you know uh and uh so it was no you know uh it wasn't complicated to really transition to a freelance environment so uh after that i just you know even you know discovering the opportunity to be an organizer you know something that i've done previously as well uh which is absolutely part of the fold uh for me now anyhow so uh yeah i mean like the freelance title uh tends to be a little boring you know uh but uh you know when i sit down and with people let them know what i do specifically what i enjoy doing specifically uh then you know i start to have this sort of like multifaceted uh many hats type of uh uh title yeah yeah and actually so that's something that i think is really interesting about your career in particular is that you are a many hats kind of developer because you work you do contract and client work um you organize the jam stack toronto meetup you're a keynote speaker you uh you make like swag you've got the the hiphop pins which i have i have some of those sitting around here actually oh man i i may have some no where do they go i i have but you've got like the ll cool js and the notorious big data and like all these amazing these amazing pins um and so you're you're kind of across the board and what i love about it is that you you have done something that i think is is really interesting in your career which is that you haven't allowed what you do to box you in to a certain set of roles or responsibilities and i think that's really inspiring and that's that's kind of what i was thinking about when we started talking about this show so specifically um what i'd love to talk about a little bit is you don't have a traditional tech background like you didn't come in through a computer science college program or anything like that so what were you doing before tech so uh i mean it's uh it's absolutely true i did not come from you know anything cs related uh i was always curious about you know cs or computers in general you know i i fiddled around as a young man uh younger men because i am still a young man but uh yeah it uh let me see i started i'd say i mean ultimately i came from music you know if i really uh go digging pretty deep um you know in college uh i did i remember doing uh college radio you know and i had my own little show whatever and um i also had like a parttime job and i say college college slash university uh but i also had a parttime job at a uh a record chain and uh yeah i mean i enjoyed it and uh that led ultimately to working at a label and uh as you may or may not remember because i know i'm sure you do remember but you know we've talked about our sort of parallel paths and whatnot in music but you tend to be around that sort of traffic where you know label execs come in you know reps uh you know they have you know swag or whatever promos and that sort of brought me into the business side of music which i loved uh i may not love as much as i did back then but uh i absolutely loved the the sort of the marketing uh the the development of careers the development of acts uh and stuff like that so that really enabled me to you know do so many things um you know being in touch with you know groups of people all the time uh you know people you don't know necessarily but you know you you get to know eventually and you know creating creating a network of people across sometimes a country if not a continent you know and these were you know things that we did in in in music marketing you know sort of being able to pick up the phone or send an email to a particular you know retailer if not you know radio person and and talk about you know some of your your sort of priorities at the time so i definitely did uh quite a bit of a time in music and at some point uh in parallel i started to work in fashion as well because an opportunity came up and neither clashed with each other on a scheduling level and certainly not on a content level sure but back then it was prior to what i saw happening after which was uh the sort of like meeting of two minds the fusing of those two uh industries you know fashion and music suddenly uh working well together handinhand so and and that was also another opportunity uh that i took i took on because that taught me a lot you know and i did a bit more of the sales thing there but there was still heavy marketing going on and like i said the music was starting to fuse in with fashion and i worked with a label a clothing label that was very forward on that level as well yeah so so kind of talking about like so you you've worked in in music you've worked in fashion uh you you got into a design agency um one of the things that i've i've noticed is like just kind of from my own career uh a lot of the skills that have helped me progress have been more on the the kind of social side and you said something that i thought was really interesting which was about building that global network right and so i remember when i was in a band one of the hardest parts of being in a band wasn't getting up on stage it was convincing a group of 16 year old kids in a city i'd never been to to go print out and hang up flyers for our show right so what kind of skills do you feel you developed in in fashion in in music that have that you use all the time that you maybe thought would not be particularly useful at the time oh you know great question and you know i've actually thought about this prior and uh i i may have i've mentioned this to you but you know ultimately i think i probably will make my way over to like a devrel position in tech but i tell people all the time you know when i sort of bring up the music bit that i felt like i was dev railing in music before i knew what the you know the the devrel title in a sense that you know you first you know you do a bit of a reconnaissance mission like okay i'm in this industry who do i need to know who do i need to talk to what they did what do they do uh that is part of my you know potential potential work mandate right and so you know you reach out to them you know cold emails sometimes but often enough it's like you know they know of your company so they're like oh yeah no doubt you know blah blah blah you get in touch and and you start that way and you know that could be a national uh situation but it could easily be international right right right and and you know again you know like you said as a as a someone who's in a band you know you know you have like 10 tour dates and you have to set up these dates with you know uh you know some marketing and some radio appearances and you know so that means like you know you know prior to zooming uh you have to make that phone calls like hey x y and z i'm coming to town yeah you know can i do a a 15minute phoner right well and what you're and what you're talking about like really is that's a that's an overlap with project management that's an overlap with with like product minded thinking because you can't just say look one of the things that i think it gets a lot of devs in trouble is they think that the only part of the job is the code um and and because of that they get a little bit stuck where they write code but they're not thinking about how the code connects to the rest of the product of to the rest of the company to the people that are using it and that kind of lets you you plateau at a certain point where you can't really push beyond and so what you're talking about with this like you know it's not just playing music it's not just doing the show there's all this stuff connected around it and so you had to develop all these skills of thinking big picture and thinking about how one part would connect to another part how you could support the work that you were doing on this on stage with different things and i think that's that's just absolutely fascinating and such an interesting thing because who would have thought that being a show promoter would help help you become a better developer right absolutely and you know it's uh i mean again we've talked about this before i've told you like i i enjoy daydreaming you know i like to sit down and just sort of you know take an idea and start to develop it you know from start to finish good ideas poor ones but you know i jot them all down and i look for opportunities to you know take a product whatever it is and finding out how i can sort of develop it so for example you know in music as you remember it's like okay we'll get the advance okay what does the music sound like all right cool who do i need to reach out to to sort of you know see this music to uh get some feedback all right cool i got some feedback now i'm potentially going to go to radio with it boom boom boom here's my priority here's the product that i'm working with you know let me know what your community says once you put that out there and then you take that feedback and you know it's pretty much the same with software you know you know you might deploy something you're working on it you have an alpha you have a beta boom boom you put it out to uh a few people get some feedback what went wrong okay cool take it back and then at some point you could put out you know 1.0 right yeah it's that whole like 10 years to an overnight success thing right absolutely absolutely you know so it certainly taught me how to think a lot um i don't say that i think differently but i do believe that you know having come from music and as you know we have to be thrift you know we have to make we have to you know take a dollar and stretch it like from here to who knows where like i'm in toronto i need to stretch this dollar to vancouver and back you know yeah absolutely it's uh we we tend to sort of really be uh you know potentially a bit more enterprising than most right yeah so um and that actually kind of has me thinking about maybe some more more practical stuff so for the the people who are watching a lot of folks are trying to break in they're trying to get their first role um so for the people who are in that position you know going back to how you made that transition when you when you were coming from from music and fashion over into tech what what did you do and like how did you how did you make yourself stand out from the other applicants how did you actually let's start there how did you make yourself stand out from other people as you were as you were trying to get that first gig so uh i mean even beyond the gig um i i'd like to talk about this like sort of in general sure uh but um i've always said that uh you know there are a lot of people who are uh equally skilled you know you're always gonna find that there are some musicians who are just like man you know he's a good guitarist you know his drums are you know whatever but at some point this is like little je ne sais quoi that makes you stand out and um you know coming from the arts uh it could have been a bunch of things uh but you know i made sure that you know i came with a bit of a different flair uh and i'm not talking about like you know i got feathers coming out my hat or whatever but you know i i i do want to make sure that you know you're going to remember me no matter what happens right um so you know on the work level you know my first gig in dev uh was you know i knew people you know and i knew uh someone who had uh mentioned that a particular company that they're working with were looking to fill in this role and you know i was lucky enough to uh make it to the top of the pile of of applicants and you know i got through yeah it's all good um but you know to me i i've always mentioned this and it's you know what's going to make you interesting you know and this is something i talk about sometimes in these these lunch and learns that i do you know like you know you go out there and find your passion and and sort of work at it right and i'll be very frank in the sort of like freelancer role and and sort of like this whole developer scene right now um i think a bunch of things happened um for what you know this may seem like you know such a small thing uh and bizarre thing to mention but i was like how you how are you not gonna forget me and the first thing was like my my twitter handle uh and you know i used to get asked so much if it was my real name i was like this is like they're not forgetting me right right i mean there's been discussion about it in the in the chat today about your about helvetica is your last name so that's that's like a developer stage name right it's a known plume absolutely you know it's not my real name but you know people gravitated towards it so much that i was like okay when i went to conferences i just asked them to to use this as my my uh my name and you know there are a couple reasons beyond that i could get into but you know that was one and two what i also did was uh you know when i was sort of you know a nobody and i'm just a bit less of a nobody right now but i'm still a bit of a nobody but you know i remember just uh you know the things i got into i just started to read about and i used to start to tweet about it and if i could i'd i'd sort of tag the the author and be like hey you know i really love this quote boom and you know i'll just put that out there also to sort of help myself but to really just build this this rapport with the community to let them know like this is what i'm into and you know if you go through my timeline you're going to see a lot more of this i remember running into some authors later who told me they loved it you know they loved seeing someone reading about their work and quoting it to the rest of the world and i heard that from authors i heard that from other developers who just started to follow me just on that basis yeah um and you know that also meant that i was starting to deep dive in these areas that i was into as well and so deep diving sharing my passions uh making sure that people would remember me uh and then you know things start to happen slowly thereafter yeah it well and it seems like i think a lot of people think that you have to know everything um and you know i i think that maybe a a sign of of growing in your career is realizing that there's just no way you're never gonna know everything um but i think maybe the surprising thing is that you can you can really specialize and there's a lot of work there like for example you are a um like an image performance specialist you're you've got one of the you're like one of the people i see do the most uh content about this right and that that brings you work right so you know i i never want to use specialists as a sort of like uh you know title uh sure certainly aficionado uh i enjoy the conversation i enjoy hearing about it uh i mean there are some speakers out there or you know some engineers uh some researchers in in the the uh sort of like images and the rendering scene that they don't speak a lot but when they do i enjoy you know i take time out of my day to make sure that i'm i'm available to see their talk you know like people like uh cornell zinski he doesn't speak a lot but i remember a couple years ago when he was at perth now i was like you know the minute the videos were available i was right there watching it absolutely so yes you know you tend to i mean you need to project what people want to see right so uh you know if you're going to be a jerk project that you're a jerk yeah you got to get that gordon ramsay energy going exactly but but you know i i start to read a lot about uh web performance in general you know i start to attend the web performance meetup which is uh one of the meetups that i run now uh and i just started to share some of the information whatever i had and i would follow you know a lot of the uh the leaders in that field uh the you know they in turn shared some of their info and it's just like you know more for me to ingest and and sort of like voraciously sort of uh devour so um but yeah you know it i i'm a big believer that uh whatever it is that you're into you know maybe you're a css person or you're getting into css you know share some of the css knowledge you have share you know some of the stuff that you're reading out there and people then potentially ask you questions you may or may not have the answers but you start that conversation with them and they'll be like oh yeah that that person like you know i love that they share css or just a lot of frontend stuff and you know i can ask them or you know i know i'll get like some nuggets from them at some point mmhmm so there's actually there's a related question that i want to dig into scott uh in the chat is asking so when you're learning this stuff how do you show that you know what you're talking about like especially in the context of of going in and applying for jobs i mean uh you can mention that in in some of your uh you know uh in your resume or cover letter or something like that or you may have you know a repo where you're sort of like playing around with some some content and and you're showing some of the results uh or you may have like a code pen where you've sort of laid out these sort of code blocks these examples of you working on on on a particular item that you know was puzzling to you at first but you're like okay i kind of get it now but you leave it there out in the open for the public to see and consume that's something that i'm very adamant about which is uh being public with your work and i'm not saying that you absolutely have to do it but if you do you'd be surprised because this is working on your behalf while you sleep right right right um i mean i wish i wish i pulled up the example um actually in fact there's so many links i want to carry uh for this uh for this uh talk but we'll make sure they show up in the the notes on the video so we'll we'll post some resources on the video for the replay if for anybody who's watching now or if you're watching uh the replay later on uh that'd be great i mean i could give you an example where i remember uh someone had just mentioned that they're looking for an internship um you know uh they're gonna be this is last year obviously they're going to be free and whatnot they're ready for the summer and um oh man what am i why am i forgetting his name ceo of shopify oh yeah i know who you're talking about i also yes toby yes he basically went to this person's github looked through it came back and offered them to spot the job on the spot you know in a queen he was like hey so and so i just went through github it looks great i love what you did here if you're trying to intern with us i got you right now this is not hr this is the ceo right so um i've always said you'd be surprised what can happen when you're public with your work sharing some of that some of that uh stuff you're working on i'll give you another example a really good friend of mine hussein jorday who's over at google right now he used to be at this company in toronto and he had been working on i think uh a pwa uh i can't remember which one but uh adios money got wind of it online and was looking through it and was like hey dude like i'd love to work with you on this and essentially they start to both work on this project a few months later a position opened up over google and he asked this gentleman my boy hussein to apply and you know the application process took place and he was able to join google so again this is the idea of being public which you work with which will at least get you a look and then you know things can go from there well and i love that whole idea right because i'm thinking through you know how how i've ended up working with some of the people that i work with and and sometimes it's because we we pulled a resume out of the stack but a lot of times it's because we have prior positive experiences with the people and we look for their resume in the stack and that comes from anything that comes from somebody that every time we talk to him on twitter it makes us smile somebody who is always helpful in a community forum somebody who is part of the communities that we run in who is just always helpful and supportive and making people feel like you know they can do it and just somebody who you can see doing the work like there are people who are early in their careers and i see them they're writing articles they're they're sharing their works in progress they've got those code pens they're seeing what somebody brilliant like like cassie evans will do this amazing svg animation and they'll go and they'll fork it and they'll alter it they'll you know like i saw somebody did this yesterday cassie was at smashing com and she did a an animation of the smashing cat and somebody went and put a guitar on the cat right just like forked that added a guitar and now the cat rocks out and it's like what what a fun way to learn something show that you've done it and if you're consistent with that right and actually this is probably the thing that is maybe the most important and i'll let you talk about it because you and i have talked about this a lot but consistency continuing to show up like how big of a role has that played in in your career you know uh tremendous i and uh i mean before i get into that i want to actually bring up another example uh because you said something that made me think of it i was listening to a podcast you know this gentleman bdoggy jamstack radio yeah and if anyone wants to go and listen to the very last or the most recent one i think it's episode 65 or 66 and someone who is at a boot camp right now uh prior to going to the boot camp i had been super curious uh and you know started to poke around this actu this gentleman came from music in fact uh and he started to poke around you know uh i think python maybe but he really got into development and uh at the same time he was discovering you know the jam stack and i think he's been playing around with redwood js and so at the same time he was attending the boot camp which is still now i believe he had been in the redwood js slack sort of like having these conversations with them and you know talking about things he was he was discovering uh with the framework and you know i'm listening to this thinking like the minute this gentleman has done this program he's got work waiting for him yeah somewhere guaranteed and you know as i was listening to him i was like this is brilliant because it was his early involvement his early sort of public commitment to uh to working with this you know this framework and trying to figure out how it worked uh best practices and whatnot and just to hear him speak i was like well you know this guy's got this guy's got a job you know certainly coming out uh so i just want to mention that so if anyone want to go back and listen to that podcast but getting back to your question which was you remind me again uh about consistency showing up oh yeah absolutely um i mean there are certain situations where you almost have no choice but to show up and you know i think that i've put myself that position in a sense that you know as a freelancer you have to poke around to see who's doing what uh who's writing what uh keep that in mind uh also the idea of you know as an organizer uh you're also looking for people who have interests in the field so that you're forced again to see uh who's writing what who's speaking where what was the talk about uh and this is all information that you take in so the only way you find these things out is is if you show up absolutely that's it um and you know again it's getting back to the music pic right you know it can be at times you're like oh man i really want to stay home tonight right you know i don't want to go see this bed because i've been out three days this week and i would rather chill but you make it out you'll be there for like half hour 45 whatever and do what you have to do and come back i think it's a bit of the same you know yeah in certain roles in not all but certain roles uh being out there seeing who's talking about what knowing who to reach out to in case you need a particular question answered a group of people may be able to answer that question for you you know joining some slacks and you know you don't even have to necessarily engage everyone but watch the conversation that's taking place uh and a lot of times those are the nuggets absolutely well and and just to kind of you know to to expand on that even a little bit more something that i think is so interesting is like you can you can see when people consistently show up they they start to become part of a community instead of observers in a community and and one of the things that i've noticed is that like everything that i've done consistently is a thing that i now am able to do for work um and and so i think a little i think of it a little bit like every time that i do work even if it feels pointless even if it feels like i'd like it's not what i wanted to do you know like as you said i just want to stay home and chill if i if i show up and i do that work that's a vote toward making that who i become and i want to cast as many votes as i can toward the lifestyle that i want i i love being able to do this show and the only reason that quincy reached out to me that i'm on the free code cam channel right now is because i showed up twice a week for the last two years on learn with jason right and and that that was a vote for me being a video internet person right um but that's been true of all parts of my career with the you know the the development job now i have now nullify and and i i think that that just you know that it seems true for all of us you know and like we talked about earlier you don't just do development you you are all over the map you've got you know you're running a meetup you're running you you're running like a clothing brand you're running uh you're you're freelancing like your freelance consultancy like all of that stuff is happening because you're showing up and doing that work and you know what the the the pins and whatnot that was just an opportunity to sort of you know uh originally it was really it's a mixture of two things you know my background in music and yeah i used to list a lot of rap whatever although you know my range was like all over the place uh but you know i thought it would be a very interesting way of of you know breaking the ice when meeting people uh and you know sort of like you know it's like a peace offering it's like hey what's up i have these pins i hope you like them whatever and people are just like oh my god you know and so that was like more fun than anything but you know in terms of you know my my current sort of priorities certainly uh you know freelance development and in fact i told you i thought you know when i discovered you know i had a greater understanding what the jam stack was you know i think i told you i think i told uh phil i was like i think this is going to be huge you know especially for freelancers but i also you know my parents are retired teachers and you know when you're when you're young coming up you might look at your parents you're like yo my parents are awesome but i'm going to get some cooler work and i was just like teaching whatever but you know with age i i start to realize how important uh being a teacher was uh being a uh sort of like a figure that people could potentially look up to um and that just took over and you know that's where the the sort of the the fascination for meetups came from and and being able to create a platform for people to come in and shine you know uh to start their careers uh potentially with you know a lightning talk and then you know move that to a more sort of substantial 30 45 minute talk whatever and then letting that take them where where it may go and uh just because i've seen it uh and i think it's an opportunity also to bring my flair to that meetup ecosystem and you know it might not be the meet up that you used to you know you roll in the music will be different yeah well then the food might be different uh the emceeing might be a bit you know have a bit more flavor when and you just did like to to maybe paint a picture of this flavor a little bit you just did a whole like themed 11d event right uh yeah like so what was november 11th so 11 11. you started it at what time was it 11 11 11. and it was on 11d but you know what again it's an opportunity to spin uh a very detailed development platform into something that could be a bit more interesting uh just the theme alone and you know it's funny you should mention that and and you know i'll shout out the speakers but they helped in putting together what was a super interesting in my eyes event more people got you know even more interested uh once they understood what was going on and they're like oh it's lightning talk okay cool and we ended up getting some of the the best talks i've heard in quite a while in terms for sure as lightning talks because everyone had a detailed uh talk there was a fantastic talk by uh dan fascia on how he was living using 110 in a medical profession and i remember he had told me in the the back channels that that's what he was he was going to do and i was just like oh i can't wait for this i'm not belittling everyone else's talk but this is the idea that people can discover new things even though they believe they're like oh i kind of know how to liven your works and whatnot but it was just like mindblowing yeah so i like to enable that sort of element that sort of discovery element that needs to happen at every step and and that's you know and that's what i think is is interesting and and one of the reasons that that i i love watching you work is that i can see you bringing the creativity from your your previous roles and trying to think about this stuff not as well it's a meetup it's a tech meetup it has to work like this and instead thinking of it as a it's a it's a gathering space we're going to bring people together and anytime people come together it can be stiff and very formal and and kind of impersonal or it can be wild you know like a house party is just an informal meetup right so how can we play with the format how can we make something that that doesn't just feel like the thing we've always done but something that feels unique something that's remarkable and i think that you have a unique talent for that um and i i would i would wager and you can confirm that this has played a pretty significant impact on on the connections you've been able to make and what that's been able to unlock for your career certainly you know and um i agree 200 with that you know and um i'll give you a quick story i remember uh when i was first coming in to the uh the environment the industry and someone had said you know you need to attend meetups because you know you're going to see and learn a lot of stuff i'm like alright cool whatever and he had mentioned this one particular meetup to attend they happen to be friends of his but i was like okay whatever and i walked in and i remember this like it was yesterday i walked in i looked around it was packed and i was like okay this is really interesting and again you know you've had this hat on i've worn it obviously you know as people came from music a full room to us is like gold you know because we've had those ones that were yeah you know very you know sparsely attended uh but that's just because we think like so far ahead sometimes you know but i remember you know sitting down and listening to the meetup and watching all the speakers and watching the organizers sort of do the thing and you know i paint a few of them i'm like guys this is really good but here are three things that i think could be improved and you know instead of just you know peanut gallery you know blah blah blah this this could be improved and just walk away i literally stepped to the organizers i'm like hey gentlemen you know this is great this is an amazing audience but i think this could improve and i immediately start to share some of my ideas and you know they told me there after i mean later on they're like you know when you came up you know and start to criticize us but we're kind of like hey you know here's some ideas there can like who's this guy you know i ended up joining them and i helped them sort of like develop uh you know better ideas uh and things that i thought could be interesting because again you have to look at a particular topic and be like okay this is cool but i think it would sound better if we said this and then we can go out and get this type of you know uh speaker uh yeah i mean i i think there are so many opportunities in tech right now to do uh really interesting things despite the fact that we are pretty much online all the time now um it just might take that extra glass of prosecco to really let your mind wander and and expand on this idea because i think uh you know some of the best ideas are hiding in in sort of plain sight you know i think there's a levity thing i was just sitting right there and because i remember i was reading something about levity and i'm like wait what's today's date and i looked at my watch i'm like wait november 11th is coming up i'm like 11 is really buzzing and i'm like i know some 118 developers okay let me reach out i reached out to them and they're like dude this sounds pretty interesting i'm like all right let's do it and you know we did a broad daylight and it was awesome yeah i think i mean it's it's so much fun uh like i've said to to watch you work it because you you do bring that kind of fresh perspective you you do interesting things that don't follow the standard format um and it's you know it's it's one of the reasons that when i'm thinking of how do we put together something fun how do we put together something different you're one of the first people that comes to mind for that um thank you and and i've i really love to see that so we're we're down coming down to the end here so let's make this a little more practical for the people watching right now absolutely um what what would you recommend both as as learning practices and as community practices like if somebody was going to adopt one or two habits today what should they start doing if they're trying to land that first gig i would say um okay so i believe there's a little bit more clutter right now and there are a lot of people trying to do the exact same thing you're doing which is land a job um i mean this is a bit of a twoparter so one prime i'm gonna one sorry i would say try not to stress it too much because i think a lot of people are you know they consider themselves ready at some point they're like okay where's the job where's the job where's the job you know how come i'm not getting any offers try not to sweat that too much but more importantly i think as you you know shop around stay active uh and you know to me that's the biggest part and staying active might mean uh something to one person and something else to some to to another one but you know if you do a lot of reading uh you know blogs or you know you're looking at you know uh i don't know uh tutorials and whatnot just keep going and and try to create this environment where people can see your work whether you're sharing this on twitter you have a github with or you have like a code pen you know shout outs to uh lintronix lin mmhmm lennon yeah linotonic like her her one div thing is bananas that's so good like i don't know anything else about her but i just know she's you know she's a gangster with the css yeah i'm saying so share your stuff online you know again whether it be a codepen twitter or github and um i would say that's like a bit of a priority for me you know i mean and and a lot of people like oh well you know the resume this the resume that yeah that's totally cool but you know we're lucky enough that in this space at the very least the work that's out there that's public that's half your resume you know people are going to be like okay they know what they're doing here you know they'll go go ahead well i was going to say for a lot of developers like when when you send in your resume your resume is basically a list of links right and so you've got to build that list absolutely absolutely and you know thereafter it could be a few different things obviously uh you know you'd be surprised what you know being part of a community might lead to and that means you know if you get to know some people and opportunities come up these people might ring you down to be like hey uh just sent you a little dm let me know when you're ready i'd love to talk to you like for example you know and i'll i'll shout you out in public for this that time uh i heard from kraft uh cms oh yeah and you know it read like hey uh i'm from kraft uh jason sent me here and i was like okay you know and i'm pretty sure i was like you dude good luck you know and uh thank you very much for that but these these are the things that i'm talking about you know when opportunities come around someone might know you and say hey i i think this is coming down the pipe and uh i i you know this this sort of like this is your lane you know let me know what you think you know i'd love to set this up um i mean in fact right before we got on i was having this conversation with someone about potentially an opportunity early next year so i'm a big believer that you know being public with your work what you do and then you know being involved with the community and you know it won't go zero to 100 overnight but you'll see your network grow and and like you said if you're that person that people just love to see work and and and they smile when you're around it's like they're going to reach out to you as well absolutely i it's that's played such a big factor in my career as well you know after after i got i actually you know what even when nobody knew who i was the way i got my first job in tech is i went to the local coding meetup and i was in montana in missoula montana so this was 14 programmers none of us wrote the same language like i was a php dev there was one other php dev most of them were java we had you know it was like nobody was doing the same stuff but we just get together because we were the only programmers in town and through that we we became friends and i got referred to a job because they were a java dev and they were looking for php and i was the php dev so i got hooked up because i showed up to this meetup right and those those connections they might feel like nothing but they they start to form a fabric and you know that that referral led to me giving my first presentation at a meetup led to me giving my first conference talk which led to more referrals and all of that has been the snowball that that got me to here and you know you you made a really good point about like not stressing at first because everybody's looking for their first job and it takes a long time to get started and it reminds me of a i wish i could remember who said this but there was a metaphor that i heard which is starting a career is like rolling a boulder it is really really really hard to get it to move that first inch but as soon as it starts to move it picks up momentum and after a while you can't stop it you're just moving and so you gotta you gotta stick with it you gotta show up and do that work every day to get that first inch um because it'll feel like nothing's happening and then it'll all happen at once um totally so henry man thank you so so much for hanging out with us this has been an absolute pleasure uh any final words for folks before we wrap this up oh man you know what um just you know wake up and and and you know smile you know it's uh i think there are a bunch of reasons especially now to to sort of like be bummed out but i think there's been literally no better time to to sort of like show your wares um and and be part of a community i mean and you'd mention the thing about speaking uh opportunities and that's something that i'm gonna work on in 2021
