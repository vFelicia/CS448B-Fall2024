00:10 - hey everybody
00:12 - sorry about that i didn't realize the
00:14 - stream has started uh and also sorry
00:17 - it's a few minutes late i was trying to
00:20 - um
00:21 - adjust some settings i don't know if you
00:23 - remember last week we had some trouble
00:25 - with the video uh kind of stopping and
00:28 - things
00:29 - and i realized that
00:33 - i used to have a wired connection
00:36 - that was obviously a lot faster than the
00:40 - uh the wi-fi
00:41 - and i had we were troubleshooting why i
00:44 - couldn't get into the database that
00:45 - we've been working with
00:48 - they had me unplug it
00:50 - and then somehow that allowed me to
00:53 - to get in
00:55 - and then i never plugged it back in so
00:58 - when i stream i'm gonna try to keep it
00:59 - plugged in and i'll try to do transfers
01:02 - from the database when i'm not streaming
01:04 - uh if if that causes me not to be able
01:06 - to get in
01:08 - so hopefully the stream goes well
01:11 - if if you are having any trouble
01:13 - watching it
01:15 - uh let me know and then i'll adjust the
01:18 - settings some more
01:19 - today's gonna be a short stream
01:21 - i have my first intern
01:24 - is starting today and they're gonna come
01:26 - in and i'm gonna try to help him out you
01:28 - know get him set up
01:30 - and just kind of walk them through
01:33 - um
01:34 - you know what
01:35 - how how we do things
01:37 - you know walking through get you know
01:40 - github how to submit pull requests and
01:41 - things like that
01:43 - uh it looks like
01:44 - you're getting audio only
01:47 - all right let me switch to my other
01:48 - screen get video issues too buffering
01:50 - only
01:52 - hmm
01:55 - so it looks like
01:58 - there may still be problems i switched
02:00 - to a
02:01 - different
02:02 - view
02:03 - i don't know why that would work but
02:05 - last time i think some of you said that
02:07 - it helped when i did that
02:12 - if that doesn't help i'll stop the
02:14 - stream and restart it because i think i
02:16 - think that helped last time
02:24 - all right uh so i guess the audio is
02:26 - fine so i'm gonna s
02:28 - still buffering huh
02:38 - that's weird the network is just not as
02:41 - good as it was
02:42 - i don't know what happened with the
02:43 - network here but
02:48 - i used to be able to run on these
02:50 - settings easily
02:58 - all right so
03:00 - since you all can hear me
03:02 - at least let me walk you through what
03:05 - we're going to do because the first part
03:07 - i was just going to explain it anyway
03:09 - so that's fine let me
03:13 - let's see live latency 75 seconds
03:17 - all right
03:23 - all right let me
03:24 - stop the stream quickly so i can set
03:27 - turn the settings down a bit
03:31 - and then
03:34 - that might help
04:01 - all right let me know
04:03 - if it's any better now or if it's still
04:06 - bad i did turn the settings down a bit
04:08 - and i shut down
04:11 - a lot of programs
04:13 - let's see
04:14 - all right right now it's saying i'm not
04:16 - dropping frames
04:19 - all right
04:20 - cool i also shut down
04:23 - i was running the slack desktop app uh
04:27 - the sql studio
04:29 - um
04:30 - app and uh the microsoft office
04:34 - or the um
04:35 - microsoft outlook
04:37 - app as well
04:39 - so i don't know maybe those could be
04:41 - draining things i i know i've always
04:43 - heard that electron apps are resource
04:45 - intensive so
04:47 - you know two of those three i i know are
04:49 - electron apps i don't think the um
04:54 - the outlook app is but and we're also
04:57 - running
04:59 - a couple of windows of visual studio
05:00 - code which i'm not going to shut down
05:02 - because we're going to use it so
05:04 - that's it oh and i have spotify running
05:06 - so
05:08 - that could be it
05:17 - uh so so the webcam is still dropping
05:20 - frames
05:22 - but it but it is better
05:25 - uh
05:27 - i'm really gonna have to mess with the
05:28 - settings at some point but
05:32 - as as long as you can see the code
05:37 - let me let me get some code up here
05:41 - so let me know
05:43 - if this is readable
05:58 - all right
06:00 - so i'm waiting for a response let me see
06:01 - there i know there was a question up
06:03 - here
06:05 - uh blake asks
06:06 - if he should go with
06:09 - uh something like shopify or woocommerce
06:12 - wordpress
06:14 - um
06:15 - i've never used shopify uh so i can't i
06:18 - can't really comment on it i just know
06:20 - that
06:21 - i hear about it a lot it seems pretty
06:24 - popular
06:25 - uh i'd say for woocommerce if you don't
06:27 - plan on having a lot of traffic to your
06:30 - site woocommerce would be fine it's
06:32 - pretty easy to use but i have seen sites
06:36 - that
06:37 - when they get a ton of traffic
06:39 - woocommerce seems to run really slow and
06:41 - take up a lot of resources
06:44 - so that's something to keep in mind but
06:47 - as i said i think that's only really a
06:49 - problem if you're gonna have a lot of
06:51 - traffic at once and um i just saw a site
06:54 - like that and they would run sales and
06:56 - things and whenever that happened their
06:58 - site was
06:59 - really really slow
07:10 - all right
07:11 - harsha's saying it's kind of unwatchable
07:15 - all right let me
07:19 - see what else i can shut down
07:22 - the code is readable
07:24 - all right
07:25 - it seems the code is readable
07:27 - i'm gonna shut down more stuff
07:33 - let's turn off
07:35 - everything
07:48 - um
07:50 - actually i'm going to turn off ang rock
07:52 - as well
07:55 - let's turn off
07:57 - some posters we're not going to use this
08:00 - today
08:04 - make sure
08:18 - we'll need that
08:25 - all right so it looks like um
08:28 - you all can see
08:29 - the words which is fine you don't really
08:31 - need to see my face
08:34 - anyway
08:36 - um
08:39 - so as long as as long as you can hear me
08:41 - and you can see what i'm doing
08:44 - then this should work
08:46 - and i will work more on getting this to
08:49 - work uh like i said
08:53 - i'm i don't know i don't know what's up
08:54 - with the internet
08:56 - um
08:57 - so anyway hey everybody that's saying hi
08:59 - on the live chat sorry for the the
09:01 - weirdness uh
09:02 - again on the quality
09:06 - um let's see
09:10 - oh hey um
09:12 - viniqua norwood is here i think i said
09:15 - your name wrong last time so i think i
09:17 - said verneek and i'm pretty sure you
09:20 - told me at the november conference it
09:22 - was for neuqua let me know which way is
09:25 - the right way to say it because i felt
09:26 - really bad i didn't remember until after
09:28 - the stream that
09:29 - um
09:31 - i'm pretty sure i did the same thing
09:32 - when i met you
09:34 - and uh
09:35 - and then i forgot again
09:48 - all right harsh it says streams at 720p
09:51 - um
09:53 - not 1080. harsha says changing coding
09:55 - settings
09:57 - um
10:01 - yeah
10:02 - i can try to mess with the settings more
10:11 - it just is so weird that the the
10:13 - settings that have been working for
10:16 - i don't know the last eight months is
10:18 - not
10:19 - all of a sudden do not work anymore
10:34 - all right let's see
10:39 - let's see
10:56 - all right is it better when i don't have
10:59 - the video there
11:26 - all right
11:29 - all right let me try to
11:31 - let me try to work
11:35 - um
11:38 - all right so here's the problem
11:41 - that we need to fix so we need to do it
11:43 - in like
11:45 - less than 40 minutes
11:49 - i mean we don't have to but i'd like to
11:50 - in the stream
11:51 - so
11:52 - i have
11:55 - is this it
11:57 - yeah
11:59 - uh so right now we have some routing set
12:02 - up so we have our default routing
12:03 - through next js which
12:14 - all right
12:15 - the stream status is good right now
12:18 - i changed the output
12:25 - so
12:26 - let me know hopefully this is good now
12:29 - i definitely don't want to drop down to
12:31 - 720p all the time but
12:34 - uh
12:35 - 10 i'd rather have 1080
12:39 - for now it's okay
12:41 - let me know
12:44 - um
12:45 - leonard says your boss needs to sort out
12:47 - his priorities it's definitely not up to
12:49 - my boss what um
12:52 - what my internet i have it's
12:56 - it's definitely uh
12:57 - another department and higher up than
12:59 - that
13:02 - all right cool so it's better
13:04 - now i don't know maybe
13:07 - maybe something was done to the internet
13:09 - that i'm not aware of and i won't be
13:11 - able to stream
13:12 - at the same quality as before
13:18 - i don't know we'll see i hope that's not
13:19 - the case
13:21 - but
13:22 - i mean 720p i guess is is doable
13:27 - all right
13:30 - so it looks like the stream status is
13:31 - staying good at least from that's what
13:33 - youtube is telling me
13:36 - okay
13:38 - all right
13:39 - let's let's do this now
13:41 - but uh really really sorry that uh we've
13:45 - taken up this much time on technical
13:47 - difficulties
13:50 - um
13:51 - okay
13:53 - so here's what i want to do in order to
13:55 - keep the urls the same
13:57 - uh what i need to do is
14:00 - instead of like a uh top level your like
14:03 - for instance
14:05 - if we were to type in
14:09 - right now the way this is set up if i
14:11 - were to type in something like
14:13 - franciscan dot university slash about
14:16 - it would route
14:18 - to a page named about here
14:21 - it would render that page
14:24 - but what i wanted to do
14:27 - if someone were to type in slash about
14:32 - i wanted to
14:34 - send all the traffic for that
14:37 - to a one component
14:41 - but
14:42 - that's not what it's the only thing
14:44 - that's going to happen i want multiple
14:46 - routes to be sent to that one component
14:50 - and i want to pass in some data just
14:52 - like we're doing here and that's going
14:54 - to determine what data gets rendered
14:57 - there so you see it's
15:02 - these are no longer going to be like
15:04 - single pages
15:08 - so we're basically kind of like
15:10 - overriding the default behavior for uh
15:13 - for next
15:15 - but
15:16 - i don't really see another way i
15:18 - discussed some of these in the latest
15:20 - issue in this repository if you want to
15:22 - read more about why and what i'm trying
15:24 - to do you can check that out
15:26 - uh the possible solution i gave there i
15:28 - don't think is the best i
15:30 - thought about it more and
15:33 - i i think the one that i've come up with
15:35 - now is better so you can see some of my
15:37 - idea here
15:39 - in my comments i'm gonna route each page
15:41 - individually to one component
15:44 - like majors and then pass in the correct
15:46 - slug manually as the id and then we're
15:49 - also gonna have a proper route so we're
15:50 - gonna have one route that matches the
15:52 - old routing system
15:54 - which i don't think is is organized
15:57 - properly
15:58 - then we're going to have the new routes
16:00 - what's that that is going to end up
16:02 - having two different pages with the same
16:03 - content which is not great for seo but
16:06 - we got to do it because we want
16:09 - a more reasonable routing structure url
16:12 - structure but then we also don't want to
16:14 - break links
16:15 - uh so
16:17 - i'll take my chances with the seo
16:20 - so here's what we're going to do
16:22 - and this is very much gonna be like a
16:24 - test
16:25 - of whether or not this even works
16:28 - so i've thought about it
16:30 - it should work but i haven't tried it
16:32 - yet
16:35 - okay so let's do this down here
16:39 - we um
16:42 - let's see we pasted
16:50 - yeah let's put that there
16:58 - let's see
17:02 - here we go
17:03 - all right so we're going to work first
17:05 - with majors
17:09 - um
17:12 - no no it's not there so let's work
17:16 - with theo i know theology is a uh
17:20 - right now
17:22 - there's a theology is like a
17:25 - um
17:27 - i'm gonna say like a top
17:29 - level
17:30 - um
17:31 - in in the hierarchy of our urls
17:35 - and let's route this to the component
17:38 - called major
17:41 - so what i want to happen is
17:44 - let's see id is
17:50 - theology
17:52 - as a string
17:54 - there we are so what i want to happen
17:56 - then is to have several of these
18:02 - and
18:03 - let's go
18:03 - [Music]
18:06 - nursing
18:09 - and this will also be
18:11 - nursing alright so
18:13 - this might be a little bit easier to
18:14 - understand
18:16 - so we're going to have to manually put
18:18 - in
18:19 - these
18:22 - and then
18:24 - pass in what we want to major
18:28 - that's more work than i wanted to do
18:32 - uh but the alternative would be
18:35 - and this is the alternative that i had
18:37 - in
18:38 - uh the issue uh that i opened
18:42 - the alternative i was thinking would be
18:45 - that
18:45 - everything
18:49 - we basically put an id right here
18:52 - and then pass in whatever that string is
18:56 - here
18:58 - and the the problem is then we won't be
19:00 - we can't use custom post types for
19:02 - everything everything in wordpress would
19:04 - have to be a page or let's say a blog
19:06 - post i'd probably do it as a page
19:08 - because it would make more sense to
19:09 - people
19:11 - um but then you'd have a bunch of
19:13 - different stuff in there together so
19:14 - like all your majors would be in there
19:16 - but then you'd have like your privacy
19:18 - policy in there and
19:20 - you know everything that's that top
19:22 - level in the hierarchy of the url would
19:24 - all have to be in there so it would be a
19:27 - mess
19:29 - to
19:31 - to keep up to date
19:33 - so i think i'd rather have a bit of a
19:35 - mess here in the code and that way i
19:37 - only have to deal with it
19:39 - and then the people who are going to
19:42 - edit things in wordpress
19:44 - will have things
19:46 - looking a lot more neat and organized
19:50 - it mean it makes sense for me to be able
19:52 - to do this is going to be a pain now but
19:54 - it's not going to be that much of a pain
19:56 - later because these aren't going to
19:57 - change like ever
20:02 - but we'll have you know students uh
20:05 - student workers editing these things and
20:09 - you know people that don't have
20:11 - necessarily that much uh experience
20:14 - so
20:16 - it'd be easier if things were more
20:17 - straightforward for them
20:19 - so that's why i've decided to do it this
20:20 - way instead the other way it's going to
20:22 - make our file here
20:25 - a lot
20:26 - bigger
20:28 - but
20:30 - i just i don't really see any way around
20:32 - that right now
20:35 - all right so let's give this a test here
20:39 - so let's see theology
20:41 - and nursing so we already have this data
20:44 - in
20:47 - yeah i think we have this data and i'll
20:49 - have to check on the slugs and make sure
20:50 - we have the proper slugs but we should
20:52 - be able to pull some of this in
20:54 - so let's go into our
20:57 - oh let's bring this back
20:59 - and let's make a component now
21:02 - called major
21:12 - file
21:16 - all right so we make this component
21:17 - called major and i did a test component
21:21 - a little while ago i think i can just
21:23 - copy this
21:25 - and paste it in a major and it should
21:26 - work for what we want to do now
21:30 - we
21:31 - we're going to need a new query yeah
21:33 - we're going to need a new query as well
21:38 - but this should work query id
21:48 - all right so this was just showing the
21:51 - id that's getting passed in so i want
21:55 - more than that i think
21:58 - what i'll need is what are we doing for
22:00 - news here
22:04 - yeah we'll want something like this
22:17 - all right
22:20 - so it's not going to be news it's going
22:22 - to be
22:24 - major and
22:27 - we're gonna have to change this query so
22:29 - this would be
22:31 - major query
22:32 - query
22:35 - major
22:38 - major query
22:41 - why
22:42 - all right
22:43 - um
22:46 - i used to find it never used
22:50 - all right well let's get rid of it
22:55 - all right so we have this query
22:58 - and let's change it here
23:05 - major
23:06 - all right so now let's go to
23:09 - where we have our queries
23:12 - let's make one called major
23:17 - so i'm trying to go more quickly than i
23:19 - usually do because this
23:20 - it has to be a short stream
23:22 - um i will get back to the live chat and
23:24 - answer some questions before the stream
23:26 - is over
23:27 - uh i just want to get something i want
23:30 - to at least do one test of this
23:32 - uh before the stream's over
23:36 - did we make ours called major i thought
23:38 - i did oh well
23:40 - uh new file
23:44 - okay um let's try
23:48 - nope not that one
23:54 - um
23:59 - i do need that one and
24:02 - news
24:03 - yeah so basically need the same thing as
24:05 - the news query
24:07 - um but we're gonna put it in
24:09 - major
24:11 - and
24:12 - we'll name this
24:22 - major query
24:27 - i'm gonna double check directory all
24:30 - right maybe maybe we need this to be
24:35 - plural
24:36 - majors where name okay
24:39 - id title slug content exit
24:44 - i don't think we're gonna have an
24:45 - excerpt for this
24:47 - i don't think we brought it in
24:50 - and i don't care about the date
24:52 - i need to just okay
24:55 - that's this is i think all we care about
24:57 - right now
24:58 - all right so we have our query ready we
25:01 - have our
25:03 - page ready
25:04 - our our component
25:08 - uh i don't care about console logging
25:10 - this
25:14 - and
25:14 - let's see
25:17 - and we're bringing the right thing in
25:19 - here
25:23 - all right
25:24 - uh let's see
25:29 - see if we can get this to work oh i know
25:31 - we need to check our um
25:34 - our slugs to see if they match up in
25:37 - wordpress
25:40 - so i have wordpress open here i need to
25:42 - log in again but we should be able to
25:45 - check
25:46 - so
25:49 - uh i guess i'll search
25:52 - oh i didn't bring theology in
25:55 - what did i bring in
26:00 - business program texts
26:12 - all right
26:13 - we'll just have to change what we're
26:16 - sending in
26:17 - business
26:20 - all right did this come in as maybe as
26:22 - business things
26:32 - so i guess this came in differently than
26:34 - i expected
26:39 - let's see if this one is
26:41 - more what i'm expecting
26:52 - i don't think so
27:18 - all right
27:19 - let's change our slugs in
27:29 - oops
27:31 - uh let's get
27:32 - this sorry miss clicking
27:35 - let's go to our screen options
27:41 - and
27:44 - slug
27:45 - so i can see
27:46 - it and i just wanted to say economics
27:53 - and we probably should double check that
28:02 - i'll let that load because it's going to
28:04 - take a while
28:05 - um
28:07 - economics and
28:09 - let's change this one to
28:17 - accounting
28:23 - let's check this
28:25 - and
28:27 - let's go to undergraduate academics i
28:30 - think that's where we want to be
28:37 - all right we're okay on time not too bad
28:40 - and our major programs
28:46 - economics and
28:49 - accounting
28:51 - we should have yep okay so economics and
28:54 - accounting yep they they have
28:57 - the url structure that i expected them
29:00 - to have
29:02 - and
29:04 - good all right so we're trying to pull i
29:06 - suppose this content
29:09 - i'm not worried about this content
29:12 - uh it's basically just this that i i
29:14 - want to pull right for right now
29:17 - and i'll have to decide with my boss how
29:20 - much of this we want to keep
29:23 - or even what format we want to keep it
29:25 - in
29:27 - all right so now we have the right slugs
29:30 - i just need to change up the slugs in
29:32 - our code
29:34 - to match
29:36 - uh so let's go back to our server
29:38 - and we'll change
29:40 - theology to
29:44 - economics and we'll change nursing to
29:47 - accounting
29:52 - for those of you who really love
29:53 - alphabetical order sorry about that
29:56 - um
29:58 - all right so
30:00 - let's see if this works
30:04 - i wonder
30:07 - i don't know if i have to restart the
30:08 - server for this to work we'll find out
30:10 - in a second
30:12 - uh i'm on
30:14 - [Music]
30:15 - here we go localhost let's give it a
30:18 - refresh
30:19 - and let's try
30:27 - economics
30:30 - okay i might i'm gonna have to refresh
30:32 - this
30:36 - um
31:02 - i
31:03 - does anybody have the location stuff
31:06 - activated on facebook where it tells you
31:08 - when nearby people are around
31:11 - so
31:12 - some of my co-workers have it activated
31:15 - and it always tells me when i'm sitting
31:16 - in my office like say hi to this person
31:19 - they're nearby
31:20 - i'm always like of course they're nearby
31:22 - they work in the same office as me
31:25 - uh i guess i should turn it off comedy
31:26 - property edge is undefined
31:41 - all right so it looks like
31:47 - we weren't getting the data
31:49 - that we wanted
32:05 - all right let's check out what we did
32:08 - um
32:10 - am i passing the right thing
32:12 - yeah i'm passing economics i'm passing
32:15 - accounting
32:16 - um
32:20 - all right and then within our component
32:23 - yeah we're trying we're grabbing the id
32:25 - it should return the id so our id should
32:28 - be in props
32:33 - and then we're passing this id
32:36 - to our query
32:44 - oops
32:46 - i forgot to change the name of this
32:48 - component
32:50 - major
32:53 - major
32:56 - oh so simple
32:58 - it's easy to forget
33:01 - let's see
33:04 - i guess it didn't matter much
33:13 - yeah it didn't even matter at all right
33:15 - because it was still going here
33:17 - um
33:20 - let's see
33:21 - i see there's some uh questions in the
33:24 - live chat i will get to the live chat
33:25 - soon
33:34 - okay veronique thank you for um
33:37 - correcting me
33:39 - i don't know why i thought it was
33:42 - it was different
33:44 - anyway
33:46 - i just i'm glad that i got it right and
33:49 - uh thanks
33:50 - thanks again
33:53 - anyway thanks for watching too uh i hope
33:55 - everything's going well with you
34:02 - all right did i date a major edges maybe
34:06 - it's majors let's try that out
34:16 - yeah that was it i just needed to put
34:18 - majors
34:19 - yay
34:20 - all right cool so we have our economics
34:22 - courses
34:23 - and then
34:24 - we'll have
34:26 - what are we gonna have here um
34:30 - accounting
34:33 - accounting
34:35 - great we have accounting now let's try
34:37 - to go to a page that we have with our
34:39 - next router uh the way i've done this
34:42 - it should work
34:45 - our next router should still work for
34:48 - anything we've set up as its own page so
34:52 - this test graphql page
34:55 - should work
34:57 - still
35:07 - okay cool
35:09 - um
35:10 - i'm assuming that's what we
35:11 - [Music]
35:12 - wanted to do here
35:16 - yeah we did we hard-coded that in great
35:18 - all right so
35:21 - so far this is working well
35:23 - not an ideal situation because i'm gonna
35:25 - have to put a lot of these in the only
35:27 - other thing that i wanted to do is
35:30 - to do something like this and we can
35:31 - test this out very easily
35:34 - is
35:39 - i want to say if we have
35:41 - major
35:42 - economics
35:44 - i wanted to do the same thing basically
35:47 - so let's save that
35:49 - and
35:53 - restart this
35:57 - and then
36:05 - economics
36:10 - awesome and that works as well
36:12 - uh let's just verify that the
36:15 - the first way works too
36:17 - cool i was actually uh i i majored
36:22 - well actually the school i went to you
36:23 - couldn't major in economics you it was
36:25 - like a triple
36:26 - thing all put together but economics is
36:29 - one of the things i studied
36:32 - all right cool so
36:34 - hopefully you can see how some of that
36:36 - worked
36:37 - now we will be able to keep the old urls
36:41 - working
36:42 - but still have our new url structure so
36:44 - the url structure that has like major
36:47 - and then economics
36:49 - that one is going to be what we use for
36:51 - all the navigation in the site
36:54 - and then
36:56 - for
36:59 - any old links
37:02 - this will still work
37:04 - uh
37:05 - i
37:06 - think i don't know it's it's a way that
37:09 - works i can just move forward and just
37:11 - grind out
37:12 - all this you know just play some music
37:15 - and just
37:16 - start copying and pasting and changing
37:18 - things and i should be able to get it
37:20 - all finished you know in an hour or less
37:23 - um
37:25 - yeah i think it can work um
37:28 - i need your id
37:36 - oh yeah har thank you uh we could
37:38 - just put in um the major
37:41 - id
37:43 - so yeah let me do that now that's yeah
37:45 - that's actually um
37:48 - a lot better
37:50 - so just like we're doing up here with
37:52 - the news id instead of passing in
37:54 - economics manually we're going to pass
37:56 - in
37:59 - um
38:00 - these params from here and let's save
38:03 - that
38:04 - and test it
38:08 - actually let's test that with accounting
38:10 - right now
38:19 - all right
38:21 - i just wanted to verify that i do in
38:23 - fact have to stop and start the server
38:26 - when i do that
38:33 - david says remind yourself jesse
38:35 - overconfidence is a slow and insidious
38:38 - killer
38:40 - i think
38:41 - david did you say the same thing in the
38:43 - last stream i do think it was the last
38:45 - stream i mean it's good advice
38:48 - um
38:49 - all right awesome
38:53 - so it does work
38:54 - excellent
38:59 - and
39:03 - economics yay
39:05 - all right great
39:10 - wow
39:11 - can't believe i got that
39:14 - uh harsh also says might remove that
39:15 - extra heading in the component yeah yeah
39:17 - we'll remove that uh too
39:20 - that was just for some testing i was the
39:21 - one earlier
39:24 - um so we won't we won't have uh this
39:27 - heading this was just to verify
39:31 - i don't even remember because i was
39:33 - obviously wasn't testing this component
39:34 - i pasted it over from a different one so
39:37 - i was testing something
39:39 - and i left it in there because it was a
39:40 - component that was never gonna
39:42 - be used i was just gonna delete the
39:44 - whole thing
39:45 - um
39:47 - all right so let me now go to the chat
39:50 - i'm gonna answer as many questions as i
39:52 - can before
39:53 - my
39:54 - new intern shows up
39:56 - and
39:58 - so it uh if the intern shows up and i'm
40:01 - not done yet then i might not get to all
40:03 - the questions but i'll do my best
40:13 - so
40:27 - uh three one says when tech experts have
40:29 - problems it makes me feel better it
40:31 - makes me feel good that
40:33 - that that implies that i'm a tech expert
40:37 - which i really don't
40:39 - consider myself a tech expert
40:43 - but
40:46 - uh it still feels good to
40:49 - have that implied
40:52 - all right
41:13 - john hanson says famous words have been
41:16 - spoken this should work
41:20 - sometimes when i say this should work it
41:22 - doesn't work but in our case it actually
41:24 - worked exactly like
41:27 - i i thought it was gonna work so
41:31 - does not happen all the time but it
41:33 - happened today
41:35 - which is great because we didn't have
41:37 - that much time for troubleshooting
41:39 - uh rook asked if there was a stream
41:41 - yesterday there was not a stream
41:42 - yesterday uh i was i did a little bit of
41:45 - work from home yesterday um i wasn't
41:48 - feeling well over the weekend i'm not
41:50 - sure if i had food poisoning or the flu
41:52 - uh just in case it was the flu i didn't
41:55 - want to
41:56 - come in here and get everybody sick so i
41:58 - thought i better
41:59 - uh just do some work from ho
42:05 - let's see
42:18 - i heard harshad said can't believe that
42:20 - data is well formatted the old style
42:22 - sheet is working fine in here too
42:24 - um
42:25 - yeah can you
42:27 - i
42:29 - it's amazing i mean this this formatting
42:32 - is
42:33 - really good
42:35 - um
42:36 - like now i mean this is compare if you
42:38 - hadn't seen some of the stuff we brought
42:39 - in earlier it might not look really good
42:41 - to you right now but
42:43 - for sure compared to the other data that
42:46 - we brought in
42:47 - this this looks great
42:50 - uh which is good these this i think is
42:52 - one of the things that we're going to be
42:53 - able to just
42:55 - bring it all in
42:56 - and just let it go as is
42:59 - at first and this will be
43:03 - adequate
43:05 - and then we can add on to it
43:08 - as
43:09 - if we get everything else finished or
43:11 - even after we launched as we had have
43:13 - time
43:15 - yeah so that's going to be the idea for
43:16 - every page except for the home page the
43:19 - home page we're going to put is
43:21 - you know a lot more effort into
43:24 - because you know way more people are
43:26 - gonna see the home page
43:28 - uh than any interior page
43:31 - uh so we want that to look nice
43:33 - and if you go into an interior page you
43:35 - want info so as long as we have the
43:37 - information there
43:39 - i'm okay with that we can always add
43:40 - something that looks nice a little bit
43:42 - nicer later on
43:45 - um
43:47 - rowler
43:49 - rauler
43:51 - says
43:53 - i just got here what are you making all
43:55 - right so uh just a quick recap
43:57 - um i was using next js with react next
44:01 - comes with a built-in router but i
44:03 - needed to do some things with the url
44:05 - structure
44:07 - uh because we're migrating from an old
44:09 - site and need to keep the old links
44:11 - working
44:12 - i needed to do some things that next
44:14 - doesn't do by default
44:16 - but we already kind of had some we had
44:18 - some custom parameterized routing setup
44:20 - anyway
44:21 - so we just kind of extended that
44:24 - and was able to
44:27 - uh we were able to keep the old urls
44:30 - route them to where we needed
44:32 - and so that's pretty much it it didn't
44:34 - it didn't even take us
44:36 - that long now i did give it some some
44:39 - thought beforehand and
44:40 - as to how i would do it
44:42 - um but
44:44 - it all worked out
44:47 - john hanson says
44:49 - is it possible to pull the ids needed
44:51 - for the page routes
44:52 - so you need to only write one function
44:58 - i i've been thinking about that
45:01 - so here's what i
45:09 - all right here's what i thought
45:12 - and i think i explained this a little
45:14 - bit before but i didn't really do a
45:15 - great job
45:16 - um so
45:20 - let's say i just did
45:23 - this
45:28 - and had
45:33 - let's say
45:34 - id
45:36 - what would happen then i mean it assume
45:39 - i have the right stuff here as well but
45:41 - what would happen then is
45:44 - this would make the uh the next routing
45:48 - it would override everything none of the
45:50 - routing and next would work
45:52 - so what i would need to do then
45:56 - is make sure that every page that needs
46:01 - every page
46:02 - that a user would go to that would have
46:04 - a url that would just be slash and then
46:07 - something and no slash after that
46:10 - would need to
46:13 - exist as the same post type in wordpress
46:17 - you can't currently search
46:21 - for a string
46:23 - in multiple post types at the same time
46:26 - with the wp graphql plugin
46:29 - there was an issue open about it it's
46:31 - something that would be nice to have but
46:33 - right now
46:35 - it's something that would take a lot of
46:36 - work
46:39 - so
46:40 - instead of
46:41 - trying to do php which i'm not great
46:43 - with and somehow
46:46 - um make that happen with the plug-in
46:48 - we're using
46:51 - this is easier
46:54 - it's gonna be
46:57 - let's say uglier when you read the code
47:00 - but it's definitely going to be an
47:01 - easier solution a faster solution
47:03 - ideally what i would like to be able to
47:06 - do is do this
47:08 - and then search but as i said before
47:10 - that is going to make things messy in
47:12 - the admin panel uh for wordpress
47:15 - so i brought in
47:20 - you know so right now we have things
47:21 - separated out in a post type so we would
47:23 - end up have having is a lot of stuff
47:27 - in here as like pages
47:30 - and
47:31 - it would query whatever the string is
47:33 - that gets passed into the as the id from
47:35 - the url
47:37 - it would query that
47:39 - and it would look in all the pages for
47:41 - that
47:42 - slug
47:43 - so we would just have a lot of different
47:46 - pages
47:47 - and i don't even know how many pages use
47:49 - this but i'm i'm pretty sure uh like the
47:52 - privacy policy so all the majors have it
47:56 - the um contact us privacy for policy
48:00 - uh directions non-discrimination i don't
48:03 - know this is consumer information see
48:06 - it's not even
48:07 - consistent
48:09 - so we have consumer information has it
48:11 - but then also we have
48:14 - um
48:16 - page within consumer information so
48:19 - basically what would happen you know
48:20 - this site's been added on to over the
48:22 - years so
48:25 - we just have a lot of variety
48:28 - so i think this way is going to still
48:30 - let us keep the custom post types as
48:32 - much as possible
48:34 - but still give us a way to
48:38 - kind of manipulate the urls a bit when
48:40 - we need to
48:42 - pretty easily so anyway all right john
48:44 - john said i get it you got to do what
48:46 - you got to do yeah this is definitely
48:48 - one of those you gotta do what you gotta
48:49 - do situations here i met with my boss
48:52 - last week and he was he said no we gotta
48:55 - keep those urls
48:57 - and i just said
48:59 - okay i'll figure it out
49:02 - so
49:03 - uh i didn't work
49:05 - i didn't really work this weekend but i
49:07 - was thinking about it all weekend
49:12 - so i guess
49:13 - i've come up with a solution
49:16 - i i just it's a trade-off i came up with
49:19 - several solutions and they all involve
49:22 - trade-offs
49:24 - this one seems like it will work out
49:29 - the best considering everybody that's
49:31 - gonna be working on the project and what
49:32 - our needs are
49:35 - all right
49:36 - so
49:37 - i think i got through all the comments
49:39 - questions
49:40 - uh so i'm right on time here
49:45 - and
49:47 - yeah so i will be back tomorrow
49:51 - uh i guess
49:52 - maybe
49:53 - i'll probably be back around 1
49:56 - i don't know if 12 is a better better
49:58 - time maybe i'll try to do 12.
50:01 - uh
50:03 - 12 is normally like my lunch break but i
50:04 - could always take a lunch break like
50:06 - earlier or later not a big deal to me
50:12 - um but i will be back and uh hopefully
50:14 - i'll have any issues sorted out with
50:17 - uh my streaming so we don't have
50:21 - you know the craziness that we had today
50:24 - uh let's see
50:27 - if anybody
50:30 - if anybody's really knowledgeable about
50:32 - obs which i'm using for streaming uh and
50:34 - you have or if you know of any articles
50:36 - or anything that could help out without
50:38 - with that let me know
50:40 - um
50:42 - i'm gonna try to look up some stuff
50:46 - test out some different things
50:49 - okay
50:50 - all right it looks like 12 is is a good
50:53 - time for some of you are saying that in
50:55 - the live chat
50:57 - okay all right maybe i'll try for 12
51:00 - then
51:02 - yeah you know there's there's actually
51:04 - way less of um
51:07 - a chance of me having a meeting at 12
51:09 - since it's normally everybody's lunch
51:11 - hour so maybe it's not
51:14 - such a bad time
51:17 - okay
51:18 - well i'm going to wrap things up here
51:19 - thank you so much for your patience with
51:21 - all the technical difficulties we had at
51:23 - the beginning of the stream and uh thank
51:25 - you for your your help as well in the
51:27 - live chat
51:29 - and uh it's just it's really cool
51:31 - everybody being here especially all of
51:33 - you that stuck through all that stuff at
51:35 - the beginning it was like almost half
51:37 - the stream i think was just taken up
51:39 - with
51:40 - you know trying to get the
51:41 - stream working properly

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody sorry about that i didn't realize the stream has started uh and also sorry it's a few minutes late i was trying to um adjust some settings i don't know if you remember last week we had some trouble with the video uh kind of stopping and things and i realized that i used to have a wired connection that was obviously a lot faster than the uh the wifi and i had we were troubleshooting why i couldn't get into the database that we've been working with they had me unplug it and then somehow that allowed me to to get in and then i never plugged it back in so when i stream i'm gonna try to keep it plugged in and i'll try to do transfers from the database when i'm not streaming uh if if that causes me not to be able to get in so hopefully the stream goes well if if you are having any trouble watching it uh let me know and then i'll adjust the settings some more today's gonna be a short stream i have my first intern is starting today and they're gonna come in and i'm gonna try to help him out you know get him set up and just kind of walk them through um you know what how how we do things you know walking through get you know github how to submit pull requests and things like that uh it looks like you're getting audio only all right let me switch to my other screen get video issues too buffering only hmm so it looks like there may still be problems i switched to a different view i don't know why that would work but last time i think some of you said that it helped when i did that if that doesn't help i'll stop the stream and restart it because i think i think that helped last time all right uh so i guess the audio is fine so i'm gonna s still buffering huh that's weird the network is just not as good as it was i don't know what happened with the network here but i used to be able to run on these settings easily all right so since you all can hear me at least let me walk you through what we're going to do because the first part i was just going to explain it anyway so that's fine let me let's see live latency 75 seconds all right all right let me stop the stream quickly so i can set turn the settings down a bit and then that might help all right let me know if it's any better now or if it's still bad i did turn the settings down a bit and i shut down a lot of programs let's see all right right now it's saying i'm not dropping frames all right cool i also shut down i was running the slack desktop app uh the sql studio um app and uh the microsoft office or the um microsoft outlook app as well so i don't know maybe those could be draining things i i know i've always heard that electron apps are resource intensive so you know two of those three i i know are electron apps i don't think the um the outlook app is but and we're also running a couple of windows of visual studio code which i'm not going to shut down because we're going to use it so that's it oh and i have spotify running so that could be it uh so so the webcam is still dropping frames but it but it is better uh i'm really gonna have to mess with the settings at some point but as as long as you can see the code let me let me get some code up here so let me know if this is readable all right so i'm waiting for a response let me see there i know there was a question up here uh blake asks if he should go with uh something like shopify or woocommerce wordpress um i've never used shopify uh so i can't i can't really comment on it i just know that i hear about it a lot it seems pretty popular uh i'd say for woocommerce if you don't plan on having a lot of traffic to your site woocommerce would be fine it's pretty easy to use but i have seen sites that when they get a ton of traffic woocommerce seems to run really slow and take up a lot of resources so that's something to keep in mind but as i said i think that's only really a problem if you're gonna have a lot of traffic at once and um i just saw a site like that and they would run sales and things and whenever that happened their site was really really slow all right harsha's saying it's kind of unwatchable all right let me see what else i can shut down the code is readable all right it seems the code is readable i'm gonna shut down more stuff let's turn off everything um actually i'm going to turn off ang rock as well let's turn off some posters we're not going to use this today make sure we'll need that all right so it looks like um you all can see the words which is fine you don't really need to see my face anyway um so as long as as long as you can hear me and you can see what i'm doing then this should work and i will work more on getting this to work uh like i said i'm i don't know i don't know what's up with the internet um so anyway hey everybody that's saying hi on the live chat sorry for the the weirdness uh again on the quality um let's see oh hey um viniqua norwood is here i think i said your name wrong last time so i think i said verneek and i'm pretty sure you told me at the november conference it was for neuqua let me know which way is the right way to say it because i felt really bad i didn't remember until after the stream that um i'm pretty sure i did the same thing when i met you and uh and then i forgot again all right harsh it says streams at 720p um not 1080. harsha says changing coding settings um yeah i can try to mess with the settings more it just is so weird that the the settings that have been working for i don't know the last eight months is not all of a sudden do not work anymore all right let's see let's see all right is it better when i don't have the video there all right all right let me try to let me try to work um all right so here's the problem that we need to fix so we need to do it in like less than 40 minutes i mean we don't have to but i'd like to in the stream so i have is this it yeah uh so right now we have some routing set up so we have our default routing through next js which all right the stream status is good right now i changed the output so let me know hopefully this is good now i definitely don't want to drop down to 720p all the time but uh 10 i'd rather have 1080 for now it's okay let me know um leonard says your boss needs to sort out his priorities it's definitely not up to my boss what um what my internet i have it's it's definitely uh another department and higher up than that all right cool so it's better now i don't know maybe maybe something was done to the internet that i'm not aware of and i won't be able to stream at the same quality as before i don't know we'll see i hope that's not the case but i mean 720p i guess is is doable all right so it looks like the stream status is staying good at least from that's what youtube is telling me okay all right let's let's do this now but uh really really sorry that uh we've taken up this much time on technical difficulties um okay so here's what i want to do in order to keep the urls the same uh what i need to do is instead of like a uh top level your like for instance if we were to type in right now the way this is set up if i were to type in something like franciscan dot university slash about it would route to a page named about here it would render that page but what i wanted to do if someone were to type in slash about i wanted to send all the traffic for that to a one component but that's not what it's the only thing that's going to happen i want multiple routes to be sent to that one component and i want to pass in some data just like we're doing here and that's going to determine what data gets rendered there so you see it's these are no longer going to be like single pages so we're basically kind of like overriding the default behavior for uh for next but i don't really see another way i discussed some of these in the latest issue in this repository if you want to read more about why and what i'm trying to do you can check that out uh the possible solution i gave there i don't think is the best i thought about it more and i i think the one that i've come up with now is better so you can see some of my idea here in my comments i'm gonna route each page individually to one component like majors and then pass in the correct slug manually as the id and then we're also gonna have a proper route so we're gonna have one route that matches the old routing system which i don't think is is organized properly then we're going to have the new routes what's that that is going to end up having two different pages with the same content which is not great for seo but we got to do it because we want a more reasonable routing structure url structure but then we also don't want to break links uh so i'll take my chances with the seo so here's what we're going to do and this is very much gonna be like a test of whether or not this even works so i've thought about it it should work but i haven't tried it yet okay so let's do this down here we um let's see we pasted yeah let's put that there let's see here we go all right so we're going to work first with majors um no no it's not there so let's work with theo i know theology is a uh right now there's a theology is like a um i'm gonna say like a top level um in in the hierarchy of our urls and let's route this to the component called major so what i want to happen is let's see id is theology as a string there we are so what i want to happen then is to have several of these and let's go nursing and this will also be nursing alright so this might be a little bit easier to understand so we're going to have to manually put in these and then pass in what we want to major that's more work than i wanted to do uh but the alternative would be and this is the alternative that i had in uh the issue uh that i opened the alternative i was thinking would be that everything we basically put an id right here and then pass in whatever that string is here and the the problem is then we won't be we can't use custom post types for everything everything in wordpress would have to be a page or let's say a blog post i'd probably do it as a page because it would make more sense to people um but then you'd have a bunch of different stuff in there together so like all your majors would be in there but then you'd have like your privacy policy in there and you know everything that's that top level in the hierarchy of the url would all have to be in there so it would be a mess to to keep up to date so i think i'd rather have a bit of a mess here in the code and that way i only have to deal with it and then the people who are going to edit things in wordpress will have things looking a lot more neat and organized it mean it makes sense for me to be able to do this is going to be a pain now but it's not going to be that much of a pain later because these aren't going to change like ever but we'll have you know students uh student workers editing these things and you know people that don't have necessarily that much uh experience so it'd be easier if things were more straightforward for them so that's why i've decided to do it this way instead the other way it's going to make our file here a lot bigger but i just i don't really see any way around that right now all right so let's give this a test here so let's see theology and nursing so we already have this data in yeah i think we have this data and i'll have to check on the slugs and make sure we have the proper slugs but we should be able to pull some of this in so let's go into our oh let's bring this back and let's make a component now called major file all right so we make this component called major and i did a test component a little while ago i think i can just copy this and paste it in a major and it should work for what we want to do now we we're going to need a new query yeah we're going to need a new query as well but this should work query id all right so this was just showing the id that's getting passed in so i want more than that i think what i'll need is what are we doing for news here yeah we'll want something like this all right so it's not going to be news it's going to be major and we're gonna have to change this query so this would be major query query major major query why all right um i used to find it never used all right well let's get rid of it all right so we have this query and let's change it here major all right so now let's go to where we have our queries let's make one called major so i'm trying to go more quickly than i usually do because this it has to be a short stream um i will get back to the live chat and answer some questions before the stream is over uh i just want to get something i want to at least do one test of this uh before the stream's over did we make ours called major i thought i did oh well uh new file okay um let's try nope not that one um i do need that one and news yeah so basically need the same thing as the news query um but we're gonna put it in major and we'll name this major query i'm gonna double check directory all right maybe maybe we need this to be plural majors where name okay id title slug content exit i don't think we're gonna have an excerpt for this i don't think we brought it in and i don't care about the date i need to just okay that's this is i think all we care about right now all right so we have our query ready we have our page ready our our component uh i don't care about console logging this and let's see and we're bringing the right thing in here all right uh let's see see if we can get this to work oh i know we need to check our um our slugs to see if they match up in wordpress so i have wordpress open here i need to log in again but we should be able to check so uh i guess i'll search oh i didn't bring theology in what did i bring in business program texts all right we'll just have to change what we're sending in business all right did this come in as maybe as business things so i guess this came in differently than i expected let's see if this one is more what i'm expecting i don't think so all right let's change our slugs in oops uh let's get this sorry miss clicking let's go to our screen options and slug so i can see it and i just wanted to say economics and we probably should double check that i'll let that load because it's going to take a while um economics and let's change this one to accounting let's check this and let's go to undergraduate academics i think that's where we want to be all right we're okay on time not too bad and our major programs economics and accounting we should have yep okay so economics and accounting yep they they have the url structure that i expected them to have and good all right so we're trying to pull i suppose this content i'm not worried about this content uh it's basically just this that i i want to pull right for right now and i'll have to decide with my boss how much of this we want to keep or even what format we want to keep it in all right so now we have the right slugs i just need to change up the slugs in our code to match uh so let's go back to our server and we'll change theology to economics and we'll change nursing to accounting for those of you who really love alphabetical order sorry about that um all right so let's see if this works i wonder i don't know if i have to restart the server for this to work we'll find out in a second uh i'm on here we go localhost let's give it a refresh and let's try economics okay i might i'm gonna have to refresh this um i does anybody have the location stuff activated on facebook where it tells you when nearby people are around so some of my coworkers have it activated and it always tells me when i'm sitting in my office like say hi to this person they're nearby i'm always like of course they're nearby they work in the same office as me uh i guess i should turn it off comedy property edge is undefined all right so it looks like we weren't getting the data that we wanted all right let's check out what we did um am i passing the right thing yeah i'm passing economics i'm passing accounting um all right and then within our component yeah we're trying we're grabbing the id it should return the id so our id should be in props and then we're passing this id to our query oops i forgot to change the name of this component major major oh so simple it's easy to forget let's see i guess it didn't matter much yeah it didn't even matter at all right because it was still going here um let's see i see there's some uh questions in the live chat i will get to the live chat soon okay veronique thank you for um correcting me i don't know why i thought it was it was different anyway i just i'm glad that i got it right and uh thanks thanks again anyway thanks for watching too uh i hope everything's going well with you all right did i date a major edges maybe it's majors let's try that out yeah that was it i just needed to put majors yay all right cool so we have our economics courses and then we'll have what are we gonna have here um accounting accounting great we have accounting now let's try to go to a page that we have with our next router uh the way i've done this it should work our next router should still work for anything we've set up as its own page so this test graphql page should work still okay cool um i'm assuming that's what we wanted to do here yeah we did we hardcoded that in great all right so so far this is working well not an ideal situation because i'm gonna have to put a lot of these in the only other thing that i wanted to do is to do something like this and we can test this out very easily is i want to say if we have major economics i wanted to do the same thing basically so let's save that and restart this and then economics awesome and that works as well uh let's just verify that the the first way works too cool i was actually uh i i majored well actually the school i went to you couldn't major in economics you it was like a triple thing all put together but economics is one of the things i studied all right cool so hopefully you can see how some of that worked now we will be able to keep the old urls working but still have our new url structure so the url structure that has like major and then economics that one is going to be what we use for all the navigation in the site and then for any old links this will still work uh i think i don't know it's it's a way that works i can just move forward and just grind out all this you know just play some music and just start copying and pasting and changing things and i should be able to get it all finished you know in an hour or less um yeah i think it can work um i need your id oh yeah har thank you uh we could just put in um the major id so yeah let me do that now that's yeah that's actually um a lot better so just like we're doing up here with the news id instead of passing in economics manually we're going to pass in um these params from here and let's save that and test it actually let's test that with accounting right now all right i just wanted to verify that i do in fact have to stop and start the server when i do that david says remind yourself jesse overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer i think david did you say the same thing in the last stream i do think it was the last stream i mean it's good advice um all right awesome so it does work excellent and economics yay all right great wow can't believe i got that uh harsh also says might remove that extra heading in the component yeah yeah we'll remove that uh too that was just for some testing i was the one earlier um so we won't we won't have uh this heading this was just to verify i don't even remember because i was obviously wasn't testing this component i pasted it over from a different one so i was testing something and i left it in there because it was a component that was never gonna be used i was just gonna delete the whole thing um all right so let me now go to the chat i'm gonna answer as many questions as i can before my new intern shows up and so it uh if the intern shows up and i'm not done yet then i might not get to all the questions but i'll do my best so uh three one says when tech experts have problems it makes me feel better it makes me feel good that that that implies that i'm a tech expert which i really don't consider myself a tech expert but uh it still feels good to have that implied all right john hanson says famous words have been spoken this should work sometimes when i say this should work it doesn't work but in our case it actually worked exactly like i i thought it was gonna work so does not happen all the time but it happened today which is great because we didn't have that much time for troubleshooting uh rook asked if there was a stream yesterday there was not a stream yesterday uh i was i did a little bit of work from home yesterday um i wasn't feeling well over the weekend i'm not sure if i had food poisoning or the flu uh just in case it was the flu i didn't want to come in here and get everybody sick so i thought i better uh just do some work from ho let's see i heard harshad said can't believe that data is well formatted the old style sheet is working fine in here too um yeah can you i it's amazing i mean this this formatting is really good um like now i mean this is compare if you hadn't seen some of the stuff we brought in earlier it might not look really good to you right now but for sure compared to the other data that we brought in this this looks great uh which is good these this i think is one of the things that we're going to be able to just bring it all in and just let it go as is at first and this will be adequate and then we can add on to it as if we get everything else finished or even after we launched as we had have time yeah so that's going to be the idea for every page except for the home page the home page we're going to put is you know a lot more effort into because you know way more people are gonna see the home page uh than any interior page uh so we want that to look nice and if you go into an interior page you want info so as long as we have the information there i'm okay with that we can always add something that looks nice a little bit nicer later on um rowler rauler says i just got here what are you making all right so uh just a quick recap um i was using next js with react next comes with a builtin router but i needed to do some things with the url structure uh because we're migrating from an old site and need to keep the old links working i needed to do some things that next doesn't do by default but we already kind of had some we had some custom parameterized routing setup anyway so we just kind of extended that and was able to uh we were able to keep the old urls route them to where we needed and so that's pretty much it it didn't it didn't even take us that long now i did give it some some thought beforehand and as to how i would do it um but it all worked out john hanson says is it possible to pull the ids needed for the page routes so you need to only write one function i i've been thinking about that so here's what i all right here's what i thought and i think i explained this a little bit before but i didn't really do a great job um so let's say i just did this and had let's say id what would happen then i mean it assume i have the right stuff here as well but what would happen then is this would make the uh the next routing it would override everything none of the routing and next would work so what i would need to do then is make sure that every page that needs every page that a user would go to that would have a url that would just be slash and then something and no slash after that would need to exist as the same post type in wordpress you can't currently search for a string in multiple post types at the same time with the wp graphql plugin there was an issue open about it it's something that would be nice to have but right now it's something that would take a lot of work so instead of trying to do php which i'm not great with and somehow um make that happen with the plugin we're using this is easier it's gonna be let's say uglier when you read the code but it's definitely going to be an easier solution a faster solution ideally what i would like to be able to do is do this and then search but as i said before that is going to make things messy in the admin panel uh for wordpress so i brought in you know so right now we have things separated out in a post type so we would end up have having is a lot of stuff in here as like pages and it would query whatever the string is that gets passed into the as the id from the url it would query that and it would look in all the pages for that slug so we would just have a lot of different pages and i don't even know how many pages use this but i'm i'm pretty sure uh like the privacy policy so all the majors have it the um contact us privacy for policy uh directions nondiscrimination i don't know this is consumer information see it's not even consistent so we have consumer information has it but then also we have um page within consumer information so basically what would happen you know this site's been added on to over the years so we just have a lot of variety so i think this way is going to still let us keep the custom post types as much as possible but still give us a way to kind of manipulate the urls a bit when we need to pretty easily so anyway all right john john said i get it you got to do what you got to do yeah this is definitely one of those you gotta do what you gotta do situations here i met with my boss last week and he was he said no we gotta keep those urls and i just said okay i'll figure it out so uh i didn't work i didn't really work this weekend but i was thinking about it all weekend so i guess i've come up with a solution i i just it's a tradeoff i came up with several solutions and they all involve tradeoffs this one seems like it will work out the best considering everybody that's gonna be working on the project and what our needs are all right so i think i got through all the comments questions uh so i'm right on time here and yeah so i will be back tomorrow uh i guess maybe i'll probably be back around 1 i don't know if 12 is a better better time maybe i'll try to do 12. uh 12 is normally like my lunch break but i could always take a lunch break like earlier or later not a big deal to me um but i will be back and uh hopefully i'll have any issues sorted out with uh my streaming so we don't have you know the craziness that we had today uh let's see if anybody if anybody's really knowledgeable about obs which i'm using for streaming uh and you have or if you know of any articles or anything that could help out without with that let me know um i'm gonna try to look up some stuff test out some different things okay all right it looks like 12 is is a good time for some of you are saying that in the live chat okay all right maybe i'll try for 12 then yeah you know there's there's actually way less of um a chance of me having a meeting at 12 since it's normally everybody's lunch hour so maybe it's not such a bad time okay well i'm going to wrap things up here thank you so much for your patience with all the technical difficulties we had at the beginning of the stream and uh thank you for your your help as well in the live chat and uh it's just it's really cool everybody being here especially all of you that stuck through all that stuff at the beginning it was like almost half the stream i think was just taken up with you know trying to get the stream working properly um all right that's it for me uh i'll be back tomorrow and until then have a great day
