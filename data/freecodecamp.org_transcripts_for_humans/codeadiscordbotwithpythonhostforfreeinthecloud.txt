00:00 - Hi, I'm Beau Carnes with Free Code Camp. In 
this tutorial that you're watching right now,  
00:05 - I'm going to show you how to create a discord 
bot with Python that runs completely in the  
00:10 - cloud. You don't need to install anything on your 
computer, and you don't need to pay anything to  
00:15 - host your bot. We're gonna use a number of tools, 
including the discord API, some Python libraries,  
00:22 - and a cloud computing platform called repple 
it you probably already know what discord is,  
00:28 - and what a discord bot is, since 
you're watching this tutorial,  
00:31 - but just in case you don't let me give you a brief 
overview. discord is an app used for real time  
00:37 - text chat, discord servers are set up by people 
and generally are focused on a certain community.  
00:42 - Many groups and organizations have discord 
servers for people to chat with each other.  
00:47 - A Discord server often has many channels, 
which are different rooms that you can chat in.  
00:52 - A discord bot is a user in your Discord server 
that is controlled by a program instead of a  
00:57 - person. You can code a discord bot to make it do 
whatever you want. There are many things discord  
01:03 - bots are often used for. They can be used to chat, 
respond to messages, manage servers, play music,  
01:10 - and more. You can also use web hooks with 
a discord bot to do things like give real  
01:15 - time updates on a GitHub repository. The first 
step for creating a discord bot is to make sure  
01:20 - you have a Discord server to add the bot to you 
may already have one. But let me just show you  
01:26 - how to set one up really quick in case you don't 
already have one. So you're going to have to go  
01:30 - to discord comm and log into Discord. And then you 
just click the plus button here to add a server.  
01:38 - And I'll say for me and my friends, and I'll just 
call it robot family server. Okay, let's create  
01:47 - that. And now we have our server. Okay, so before 
we can code our bot using Python, and using the  
01:57 - discord API, we must first create a discord bot 
account right within Discord. So you're going to  
02:05 - have to go to the discord developer portal. I'll 
put the link in the description, but it's just  
02:11 - discord comm slash developers slash applications. 
So once you're on the applications page, you're  
02:18 - going to click this new applications button. And 
then we're going to create a name for it. This bot  
02:25 - is going to send friendly encouragements to people 
from in Discord. So I'm going to call it encourage  
02:33 - bot. Okay, I'll create that. Okay, now I'm going 
to go to the bot tab here. And then I am going to  
02:42 - click Add bot and say yes, do it. Okay, we'll keep 
the default the default settings as a public bot,  
02:54 - and then we won't require the OAuth to grant 
the code grant. So now the bot has been created.  
03:02 - The next step is to copy the bot token. Okay, 
so I'll just click Copy to copy the token,  
03:09 - we're going to need that later. Now this token 
is your bots password. So make sure not to  
03:14 - share it with anybody. It could allow someone to 
log into your bot and do all sorts of bad things.  
03:20 - And it could even allow someone to mess with your 
server. And also, you can obviously regenerate  
03:26 - the token if they accidentally get shared. So 
now we have to invite the bot to our server,  
03:33 - we have the bot user, and we have 
to get into our server. To do that,  
03:36 - we're going to have to create an invite URL 
for it. So let's go to the off to tab here.  
03:43 - And now we're just gonna go to the scope section. 
Since this is a bot, we'll just click Buy here.  
03:49 - Now we have to scroll down a little bit more and 
go to the bot permissions section. So we'll choose  
03:56 - the permissions we want for the bot. Our bot 
is going to be mainly used for text messages.  
04:01 - So we don't need a lot of permissions. So your 
bot may do different things. But let's just  
04:09 - choose some of these here. Actually, we'll 
do all of them on this line, except send TTS  
04:16 - messages. Now you do need to be careful with 
this administrator permissions. If you give  
04:22 - your bot administrative permissions it has, it 
will be able to control your server in ways that  
04:27 - you may not actually want. And then I guess the 
last one we need to add is the view channels or  
04:32 - bots going to have to view the channels. So after 
selecting the appropriate permissions, we'll click  
04:39 - the Copy button right here. And this will copy a 
URL that can be used to add the bot to a server.  
04:46 - And I guess we'll also have to recopy the 
back key, we copy the back key earlier,  
04:51 - but now it's been re copied with this URL. So 
we'll have to come back later to get the back key.  
04:56 - But now let's just open up a new tab and I'm 
going to go to this URL Okay, so now we have  
05:02 - to choose the server, we want to add the bot to 
I'll choose robot family server, the only option,  
05:07 - but you will probably have more than more options. 
So we'll click Continue. And we want to approve  
05:13 - that we want to do all these things, we want 
to authorize the bot for all these things.  
05:22 - And I'm not a robot and the bot is authorized.  
05:26 - That means the bot has joined the server. So if 
we actually go over into our server, we can see  
05:32 - encouraged bot just slid into the server. But also 
you see over here that the bot is offline, it's  
05:39 - not going to be online till we write our Python 
code that creates the bot and run the Python code.  
05:46 - And speaking of Python code, it's time to start 
that. Now I said earlier that you don't have  
05:52 - to install anything, you don't have to use any 
software except your web browser, we are going  
05:57 - to be creating the entire discord bot, right in 
the cloud on replique. The website for replique  
06:06 - is our epl.it. And replique is an online ID 
EA, that you can just use in your web browser.  
06:14 - So it makes it a lot easier to code things if 
you don't have to install any special software  
06:19 - on your computer. And then you can log into 
it from multiple browsers, multiple computers,  
06:25 - and then you can easily access your code and your 
programs no matter what computer you're using.  
06:31 - So we're gonna make our button this and then 
it will also be completely hosted in the cloud,  
06:37 - we can even run the bot on this website, so 
we don't have to run it on our local computer.  
06:43 - And that will make it so we can keep the bot 
running, even if our computer shuts down, or we're  
06:49 - gonna where we close the browser tab or anything 
like that, I'll show you how to make the bot. So  
06:53 - it'll keep running in the background continuously. 
And then you don't have to worry about it.  
06:59 - If you don't already have account, you're 
going to sign up. But I'm going to log in here.  
07:03 - Okay, now that I'm logged in, and I 
click this new repple in the corner here,  
07:08 - now we just have to create, choose the language 
that we're going to use for this new repple. The  
07:13 - cool thing about repple it is that you can use 
a bunch of different languages with it. And so  
07:18 - that makes it simple. If you're going to run some 
of these languages on your computer, you probably  
07:22 - are going to have to install some extra software 
or extra things on your computer to be able to run  
07:28 - these languages. But if you just go to repple, it, 
you can just do it right in your browser. And you  
07:32 - don't have to install anything. But we're going 
to be doing this in Python. So I'll click Python.  
07:38 - And it will have a default name here. But 
I'm just going to be calling it encouraged.  
07:47 - Okay, and I'll just create the repple.  
07:54 - So let's go over the main part of Rep. What we 
have here, which is right here is the code editor.  
08:00 - And you can see a default with a file open 
called main.py. And we can type our Python  
08:05 - code right in here. And then here over here 
are the files, and you can create new files,  
08:11 - we will be creating a few new files in the course 
of creating this bot, you can also create new  
08:16 - folders. And then over here is the console. The 
console is where the standard output will appear.  
08:22 - And you'll be prompted to enter input if 
you're going to have input in your code.  
08:26 - And in Python, it's going to it's going to double 
as an interactive prompt. So you can actually type  
08:33 - in Python code right here. And it will evaluate 
the code interactively. So that's pretty cool. And  
08:40 - then over here, we have some things on the side 
here. so files, version control, if you're going  
08:45 - to associate with git, and or we're not going 
to do that in this tutorial, though. And then if  
08:51 - you're going to install packages, but there's also 
another way to install patches that we'll see.  
08:56 - And then the main thing we're actually going to 
be using is the replique database. So one thing  
09:02 - cool about replique is it includes a database 
as part of it. And so you can easily store  
09:09 - things that will keep stored in there even if you 
stop your program and run it again the everything  
09:15 - store in the database will will still be in there. 
So we will be using that later in this tutorial.  
09:20 - And then you can also change some settings, 
just like the theme of font size, all sorts  
09:25 - of stuff like that. But let's go back to the 
files because we are going to start creating  
09:31 - our discord bot right now. So I mentioned that we 
are going to be using the discord.py library. And  
09:39 - the first thing we're going to do is import that 
library. So at the top has this do import Discord.  
09:46 - And the cool thing here is that in repple it it 
will automatically install this dependency when  
09:52 - you press the Run button. So I mean my permanent 
and do very much right now but if I click Run,  
09:57 - we'll see on the side here, that it's Installing 
the discord despit dependency, and then it will  
10:04 - be able to use it in the program right away. So 
there's nothing extra you have to do to install  
10:08 - dependencies besides just importing them right 
in your program. So let me talk a little bit  
10:12 - about discord.pi. Before we continue with this bot 
here, it revolves around the concept of events,  
10:19 - and event, it's something you listen to 
and then respond to. For example, when a  
10:23 - message happens in discord, you will receive 
an event about it that you can respond to it.  
10:28 - So let's make a bot that replies to a 
specific message, we're going to start  
10:33 - with a very simple bot, and then we're going to 
add to it and just add more features as we go.  
10:40 - So the simple bot that we're going to start 
with the code is actually taken directly from  
10:45 - the discord.pi documentation. It's a really good 
example of like the most basic bot you can make.  
10:51 - And like I said, then we'll continue to build on 
that after we get this simple bot created. Okay,  
10:58 - so we got the discord library, imported. So 
let's add some more lines here. So now we are  
11:04 - going to create an instance of a client. This 
is the connection to Discord. So do a client  
11:10 - equals discord dot client. This is just part 
of the discord.py library. Now, we are going  
11:19 - to use the client that event decorator to 
register an event that looks like this.  
11:27 - So I remember I mentioned that this client 
uses events to make it work. So this is how you  
11:33 - register an event. And this is an asynchronous 
library discord, that pie. So things are done  
11:39 - with callbacks. a callback is a function 
that is called when something else happens.  
11:44 - So in this code, where you're going to use 
the unready event, so I'm going to put async.  
11:52 - def on ready. So this event is going to be called 
when the bot is ready to start being used. And  
12:03 - when it's start, when it's ready, when the bot is 
ready, we're going to do this print. And this is  
12:08 - going to print right to this console right here. 
So when the bot is run and ready to be used,  
12:14 - it's going to print this to the console, it's 
going to say we have logged in as and then we're  
12:22 - going to actually be able to get the username 
that's logged in as, and this is how you do that.  
12:39 - So there's a few ways to do it. 
But so this is taking the client,  
12:43 - this zero is being replaced with the client. So 
it's doing the client that user So that's this  
12:48 - client, this zero gets replaced with this client 
here as client, that user to get the username.  
12:55 - And to make sure I have this right next 
to the quote goes here. And there we go.  
13:04 - Okay, let's create another event. So that's the 
event that happens as soon as the bot is ready,  
13:10 - and it's working. So the next event is if it 
receives a message, if the bot senses a message  
13:17 - right in the discord server. So it's going to 
start off just the same to register the event.  
13:23 - And we're going to do another async 
function. But this one is on message.  
13:30 - So these function names are specifically 
from the discord.pi library, it's looking  
13:36 - for these function names, to know what 
to do, when certain things happen.  
13:42 - This onmessage event triggers each time a message 
is received. But we don't want to do anything if  
13:47 - the message is from ourselves, which is the 
bot. If the message is from the bot, we want  
13:52 - to do nothing. And this event takes an argument 
called message. Or you can call it anything you  
13:58 - want. But it's traditional to call a message 
because it's the message that's being received.  
14:02 - So this event triggers each time a message is 
received. But we don't want it to do anything.  
14:07 - If the message is from ourselves, we're gonna make 
it check if the message is from ourselves. So if  
14:12 - message dot author equals client, that user 
looks like I spelled something wrong there.  
14:23 - So if the author of the message is the user, 
our bot user, all we're going to do is return.  
14:30 - Next thing we're going to do is we're going 
to see if the message starts with a command  
14:34 - that's being sent to our discord bot. And we can 
make up those commands to be anything we want.  
14:40 - So in this case, I'll show you we're going to 
do if message dot content that starts starts  
14:47 - with and we're just going to make it up to be 
dollar sign Hello. For our bot. We're going to say  
14:54 - all the commands are messages that start with the 
dollar sign. So if the message starts With dollar  
15:00 - sign Hello, then the boss should know that 
it's received a command so it should return  
15:05 - something. And to return a message 
back to discord, we're going to await  
15:14 - message dot channel dot send. So this is going to 
send a message to the channel. And the message is  
15:23 - going to be Hello. Okay, so now so whenever the 
bot notices that someone says dollar sign Hello  
15:33 - within discord, it's going to respond Hello with 
an exclamation point. So this is everything we  
15:39 - need for the bot. But we still have to run the 
bot. So here's the line to run the bot client  
15:49 - dot run. And then right in the client that run 
we need to put our token, we need to put our bots  
15:57 - token which is like the password for the bot. 
Before we just go and copy the token again and  
16:03 - put it right in here, there's something I should 
tell you about replica that you need to be careful  
16:08 - with. By default, all replicates are public, 
they're visible to anyone. So anyone can just  
16:16 - access your replica. And they could potentially 
see anything you put in your replica, including  
16:23 - any secrets or keys. And remember, I told you 
that this key is like a password, you don't want  
16:30 - anybody else to find out about it. But there is a 
way to keep things secret. And that is to use an  
16:37 - environment variable. So in repple, it let me show 
you how you can use environment variables, we are  
16:45 - going to first of all, create a new file here. And 
the new file is going to be called dot E and V.  
16:54 - So that anything we put in a dot E and V file will 
not be made public, nobody will be able to see  
17:00 - anything in a dot E and V file in replique, pretty 
much on a public account on a free tier account.  
17:08 - Everything is public always except just this one 
file dot E and V, we're gonna put token equals,  
17:16 - and we're gonna set the token to equal our 
token. Now we're gonna have to go back and  
17:20 - get our token. So let's go back to our development 
portal page, the discord comm slash developers,  
17:28 - and then I'm gonna go to bot gonna copy the 
token. And then we will go back over here. Okay,  
17:38 - there's my token. I'm going to disable 
this bot later and change the token. So  
17:43 - don't bother trying to figure it out to use it 
for your own code. But now that we have our token,  
17:49 - we have to make it so it gets into our main 
file. So to do that, we are going to have to  
17:55 - do have another import statement here. So I'm 
going to put import OS, and then down here,  
18:01 - we need to access that token from the dot EMB 
file. So what we're going to put in our code here  
18:09 - is oh s dot get e and V. And then I'm going to 
put token. Now the reason why it's token here  
18:18 - is because that's the name I put right here, you 
can actually use any name for the token doesn't  
18:23 - have to be token, you just have to make sure that 
when you're getting the environment variable,  
18:27 - you use the same name here. So now when you 
run the code, it's just going to replace  
18:34 - this right here with your token. Now, if you're 
doing this locally, or you're doing in such a  
18:40 - way where you know, nobody else is ever gonna see 
this code, you can actually put your token right  
18:46 - in here. And you don't even have to import o 's 
here. But since we're doing it in a public way,  
18:51 - we need to make sure that nobody else sees our 
token, or else they could get access to our bot.  
18:57 - And that's actually it for our basic bot. 
Like I said, we're going to add some more  
19:02 - additional features later. But let's run it now 
and test this out. So click run here. Okay, look,  
19:11 - we have logged in as encouraged bot. Now let's go 
to our server. You can see look before it showed  
19:18 - as logged out, but now it shows it as logged 
in. So let me let's try this. I'll say hello.  
19:28 - Now you can see that's from from me, and it didn't 
respond. Because remember, the special command is  
19:33 - actually dollar sign Hello. So let's try that. 
And it works encouraged by just responded with  
19:39 - Hello. So our bot works if we do another command 
like Hi, how are you or not not another command  
19:45 - another message? It's not going to respond at all. 
But if we do the dollar sign Hello. Then it will  
19:53 - respond. So we just created a basic discord bot 
that responds to the command dollar sign Hello.  
20:01 - And obviously you can make it any command. So if 
you don't want to respond to dollar sign Hello,  
20:07 - you can actually use any command here. And then 
you can change what it's going to respond with.  
20:14 - Now that we have our basic 
bot working, we'll improve it.  
20:19 - I said it's called encouraged bot for a 
reason, the bot will respond with a message  
20:24 - of encouragement. Whenever someone sends a 
message containing a sad or depressing word,  
20:30 - we're gonna make it so anyone will be able to add 
encouraging messages for the bot to use. And these  
20:35 - messages will be stored in a database. So they 
will save even after you stop and start your bot.  
20:43 - We're also going to add another thing in the 
database. That turns on whether that turns  
20:48 - on or off whether the bot is is responding to 
messages. And an extra feature of encouragement  
20:55 - we're going to do is that the bot is going to 
return a random inspirational quote from an API,  
21:02 - when someone types the message, dollar sign 
inspire into the chat. So let's start with  
21:09 - that last thing I said, we're going to start 
by adding the dollar sign spider feature.  
21:14 - I found this API called Zim quotes.io. That will 
return inspirational quotes. Now, you can use any  
21:24 - API. So if you don't want to use in quotes.io, 
you can just find a different one. If somehow  
21:29 - this isn't working, just try to find a different 
API, but we're going to use is in quotes.io. And  
21:34 - a lot of these principles will apply to really 
any API that you're using. So let's go back to  
21:40 - our bot. And we are going to import some new 
things to work with this API. So what we're  
21:48 - going to do is we're going to import a couple more 
Python modules, we're going to add a get quote  
21:54 - function. And we're going to update our bot code 
to call the function. So let's import requests.  
22:04 - This request module allows your 
code to make an HTTP request  
22:09 - to get data from the API. The API returns 
JSON. So we're going to have to import  
22:18 - the JSON module. What because that's going to make 
it easier to work with the data that's returned.  
22:26 - Okay, now we're going to add a 
helper function. It's called get,  
22:31 - quote, this is a function we can call to return 
a quote from the API. So first, we're going to  
22:42 - use the request module to request data from 
the API URL. So that's going to go like this,  
22:48 - the response we're going to store the response 
from the API in a variable called response.  
22:56 - And so we have to use the request module like  
22:58 - this request that get we're going to 
make a get request to this URL. Now,  
23:03 - I just had to find this URL by looking at the 
documentation of this in quotes API. So HTTP,  
23:10 - S, colon slash slash is in quotes.io. Slash API 
slash random, it's going to return a random quote.  
23:26 - Okay, now we're going to convert that response 
into JSON. So we're going to do JSON, data  
23:37 - equals JSON dot loads, response, that text. So 
this response that text, I just had to look in  
23:48 - the documentation of the API, and found 
out that the response is going to have  
23:53 - this response that text that I can, I can load 
into JSON. So now we have to do something with  
24:00 - this JSON, we have to get the quote out of it. 
Now, this was a lot of trial and error, I had to  
24:08 - print out the JSON data and try to figure out 
how how to get the exact part of that JSON  
24:16 - that I needed. So so this is what what we 
ended up with, quote, equals JSON data. Zero,  
24:28 - Q. Now, that's going to be the quote q stands for 
a quote. And it's just something that's part of  
24:39 - this in quotes API, the result that's returned 
from this API is going to have a key called q  
24:48 - when the value is going to be the quote. 
So we're going to start with the quote,  
24:52 - but then we want to add after the quote, 
the author of the quote who said it.  
24:57 - So I'm just going to add a plus we're going to 
do some string concatenate Nathan here. And I'm  
25:02 - going to make it have a space after the quote, 
and it's going to be a dash, the dash is going  
25:08 - to be right before the person's name. It's just a 
way to kind of show who's who's doing the quote.  
25:13 - So we'll do another plus here. And let's go back 
into the JSON data. And this time, instead of the  
25:22 - queue, we're going to do a for author. Okay, so we 
got a quote in here. Now, I can return the quote.  
25:34 - Okay, now we have to update our bot. So it uses 
this get, quote function to get a quote, and then  
25:40 - return the quote, as a message to Discord. Let 
me scroll down a little bit here. So now I'm just  
25:46 - going to update these lines here. This was just an 
example to rich to respond to the message Hello.  
25:55 - But that's not what our final bot is going to 
do. So I'm going to change this to inspire.  
26:03 - And let's move this over a 
little bit. So we can see more  
26:07 - of the code. So if the bot gets this message 
inspire, we're going to send a quote. So  
26:16 - the way we're going to send a quote is first 
adding another line. So I'm gonna put quote,  
26:21 - equals get, quote. So it's going to call the 
get, quote, function and return the quote here.  
26:29 - And now I can just return the quote, or I can 
send the quote to Discord. Okay, at this point, we  
26:39 - can run the code and try it out. If it's already 
running, we got to stop it, and then run it again.  
26:47 - And then we have to wait till it says it's logged 
as encouraged bot. That means we can go back to  
26:51 - our Discord server, and say, Hi, bot doesn't say 
anything. Let's see if it will say, Hello, hello.  
27:00 - Okay, that command doesn't work anymore. 
Because we change it. Let's do inspire. Okay,  
27:07 - we have an inspirational quote. And let's try 
inspire a few more times to see if it's random.  
27:15 - There's another one. There's another 
one. See, we're getting a random quote,  
27:22 - for every time we do it. So this is the quote part 
by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail.  
27:27 - And then we add that the space and then the 
dash, and then the author Benjamin Franklin.  
27:32 - Okay, well, that works. Let's go, go back to our 
bytecode. Now we're going to implement the feature  
27:38 - where the bot responds with encouraging messages 
when a user posts a message with a sad word.  
27:45 - So in this, this time, the user isn't putting a 
certain command into discord to get a result. This  
27:52 - time, the bot is going to be checking every word 
in every message to see if there's a sad word. And  
28:00 - if it's if it notices a sad word, it's going to 
return an encouraging message. So the first thing  
28:07 - we're going to do is to create a Python list that 
contains the sad words that the bot will respond  
28:14 - to. So right after the client variable is created, 
I'm going to create another one called sad.  
28:21 - Words. And the CI word. This is just going to be 
a list like I said, oops, there we go. depressed,  
28:35 - unhappy. Now I'm gonna have a list of 
words here, you can add additional words.  
28:42 - Really, you can put any words you like on 
this list here. I'll have a miserable. And  
28:50 - let's do one more. How about depressing? Okay, so 
we are going to make it so whenever the bot sees  
28:56 - one of these words in the message, it's going to 
respond. So what is the bot going to respond with?  
29:05 - Well, now we're going to add a list of encouraging 
messages that the spot will respond with when it  
29:11 - sees one of those words. So I'm going to make a 
new variable called starter and encouragements.  
29:21 - Now, I'll tell you why this is 
called starter encouragements.  
29:24 - It's because these are the there's going 
to be just a few encouragements that the  
29:29 - bat starts with, but users will be 
able to add more encouragement later  
29:33 - that are stored in the database. So the start 
encouragements I'm just gonna do a cheer up.  
29:44 - Hang in there.  
29:49 - And you are a great person, or maybe it's 
just another bot. So we'll do person slash bot  
30:00 - Feel free to add any number of encourages you 
like, and remember later, user will be able  
30:06 - to add more encouragements. Now we need to update 
our bot to use the two lists that we just created.  
30:12 - So the first thing we're going to do is import the 
random module, because the bot will be choosing  
30:18 - messages randomly. So import random. And we'll 
be using this later the random module to make it  
30:25 - get the random message. So we're going to update 
the on message response here, we're going to add  
30:32 - something on in this on message async function, 
that's gonna check all the messages to see if  
30:38 - they contain a word from the sad words list. And 
then if the sad word is found, the bot will send  
30:43 - a random message of encouragement. So here's the 
code for that. After we check to see if it has  
30:48 - starts with inspire, then we're going to check 
just if it has any other word from the sad word  
30:55 - list. So this is how we're gonna do if any, if any 
weight, if any word in message for word and sad  
31:10 - words. So this just means it's going to go through 
every word, and the sad words. And gonna see if  
31:19 - any of those words are in the message. If it sees 
any of the word in the sad words in the message,  
31:25 - then it's going to Oh, wait. Message dot channel 
dot send. This is just like this line above here.  
31:38 - And what is it going to send, it's going to send 
random dot choice, it's going to choose a random  
31:44 - choice from starter encouragements from 
that list that we created. Okay, we can  
31:51 - test the button Now, let's see if there's 
something wrong here. undefined name message.  
32:02 - Okay, got it. I got ahead of myself 
here. Actually, this message should be,  
32:08 - it's actually supposed to be message content 
by switch to message, because since we're  
32:13 - going to be using message content a bunch 
of times, what I want to do actually, is  
32:20 - create the message variable right here message 
equals message content. And then anytime we  
32:26 - see message content, we can switch it with 
message here. Okay, let's test the bot now.  
32:39 - Okay, let's go back over here. Let's 
see if the Inspire still works.  
32:47 - Worked. Now let's check the sad word. I am sad.  
32:51 - You're a great person bet Brett person's 
life spot. Well, now, I am depressed.  
33:01 - Hang in there. Oh, that's making me 
that is making me feel much better.  
33:09 - Thanks. This encouraging by is very encouraging. 
So it's working, it can now respond, whenever it  
33:18 - sees sees a stad method, it's going to try to 
encourage the person that put that sad message.  
33:25 - So at this point, you basically 
know enough to create your own bot.  
33:30 - But let's keep going because we're going to 
add some more advanced features that I already  
33:34 - discussed. Now let's make it possible to update 
the bot right from Discord. A user should be able  
33:41 - to add more encouraging messages for the bot to 
use when it detects a sad word. Like I mentioned  
33:46 - before, we're going to use repple. It's built 
in database to store user submitted messages.  
33:52 - This database is a key value store that's built 
into every rebel. So let's add that to our code.  
33:58 - Now. Now, I showed you this before this tab here, 
this the only really the only point of this tab  
34:06 - is to just show you the commands the 
most common commands for the database.  
34:12 - And you don't actually need to get in from here 
if you already know him because this type of men,  
34:17 - but let's go to the top of the code and we're 
going to Alka just insert this so I inserted from  
34:24 - replique import dB. This allows us to use the 
replicate database. Before we add new commands  
34:31 - for the bot. Let's add two helper functions that 
the first one will be able to add custom messages  
34:37 - to the database. And the second helper function 
will be used to delete messages from the database.  
34:44 - So let's go under the get quote function.  
34:49 - This new function is going to 
be called update encouragements.  
34:57 - So that's gonna it's going to update 
the encouragements in the database.  
35:00 - And it's going to accept an 
encouraging message as an argument.  
35:17 - So first, it's going to check if encouragement 
is a key in the database. So if encouragements  
35:29 - do that, right, encourage myths is in dB 
keys. So DB keys just returns a list of  
35:37 - the keys in the database. So if increment 
is already in the keys, it's going to get  
35:44 - those all the key all the incursions are 
already in the database. encouragements  
35:51 - equals the way to get a value from the 
database that stored under a certain  
35:57 - key is like this DB encouragements. 
Okay, so we've gotten the encouragement.  
36:08 - Now we just have to add the new encouragement to 
this list. So encouragements dot append that's  
36:16 - going to add something new to this list. And we're 
going to type in the encouraging message, which is  
36:23 - the argument that was passed into this function. 
And then after we append the new encouraging  
36:29 - message to the old encouraging messages, we 
have to save it again into the database. So DB  
36:37 - encouragements equals  
36:46 - encouragements. Else, if there's not 
already encouraged us in the database,  
36:54 - then we're going to have to 
create it. So dB, encouragements  
37:02 - equals, and we're going to put a bracket 
here because this is going to be a list,  
37:08 - but it's only going to have one message. And 
the one message is the encouraging message  
37:13 - that was passed into this function. Okay, 
so now, let's see what we did wrong up here.  
37:21 - Okay, that's supposed to be if encouragements 
in dB key not is I just excellent typed an  
37:29 - essence of it in. So that's supposed to be in. 
Okay, so now, we finished our helper function,  
37:36 - let's create a new one, which is to delete an 
encouraging message. So def delete, encouragement.  
37:48 - And it's going to take an index, as is an 
argument, the index of the message to delete.  
37:58 - So first, we need to get a list of the 
messages from the database. So encouragement  
38:06 - equals dB. encouragement. So we got the 
list of encouragement from the database.  
38:14 - Now we have to check if the length of 
encouragement is more than the index, because  
38:22 - the person could pass in an index that's, 
that's actually not in that that list.  
38:29 - The person could pass in an index that's actually 
not part of the list. So if the length of  
38:35 - encouragements is more than the index, then we're 
going to delete DLS. Delete. We're going to delete  
38:41 - the encouragements at that index. And finally, 
we are going to save it into the database again  
38:54 - equals encouragements. And this can 
actually be in this if statement.  
39:02 - Okay. Done. We can now add an 
encouragement and delete and encouragement.  
39:11 - Now let's update our bot code to use these 
functions. So users and discord can update  
39:18 - encouragements and delete encouragements, 
right from Discord. Let's go down here.  
39:25 - So the first thing we're going to do, if you 
remember, currently, it returns a choice from  
39:31 - the starter encouragements if it sees a sad word. 
But we want to also be able to return a random we  
39:39 - want the random encouragement to also be able to 
come from the database. So let's add some code to  
39:46 - be able to use the starter encouragements with any 
encouragement that has been added to the database.  
39:52 - So first of all, I'm going to create a new 
variable options equals starter encouragements.  
40:00 - Okay, so now, if there are if there's any 
incursions in the data in the in the database,  
40:08 - if encourage meant in dB keys,  
40:16 - then we can, we can add those to the options. So 
options equals options plus DB encouragements.  
40:42 - Okay, so now instead of picking from starter 
encouragements, we're going to pick from options  
40:49 - of encouragement to return. Now we're 
going to add some code to add a new  
40:55 - user submitted message to the database. 
So it's going to be looking for a new,  
41:02 - a new command. So if the message 
from discord starts with the command,  
41:17 - knew, if it starts with the command new, that 
means it's going to be a new message to add to  
41:23 - the database. So the command that the bot is going 
to be looking for is the command dollar sign new,  
41:31 - but then in the same message that you that the 
user puts dollar sign new, they're going to put  
41:36 - a space, and then they're going to put the new 
encouraging message. So we need to break off  
41:42 - the encouraging message from the the new command 
because we don't want to add the new command to  
41:48 - the database, we just want whatever text comes 
after the dollar sign new, whatever text that  
41:54 - the user submits, after DOS, I knew we want 
to add that to the database. So let's do let's  
42:00 - get the encouraging message. And the couraging 
message is going is going to equal message dot  
42:06 - split, we're going to split off the message 
from New. So we're gonna do dollar sign new.  
42:19 - Okay, so we are now going to get an array of 
the message that splits at New. And so we're  
42:26 - getting the second element in the array. And 
that second element of the array is going to be  
42:31 - the new message. Now you can see that we're not 
just splitting at New, we're splitting up new  
42:36 - space. So there's a space after that, because 
we don't want the user is going to put dollar  
42:41 - side new space and then the message and we 
don't want to add the space to the database.  
42:45 - We just want the message after the database 
or after New. So we got the new encouraging  
42:50 - message. And now we just need to update the 
encouragement with that new encouraging message.  
43:00 - Then we want to send something back to the user 
so they know that it worked correctly. So wait  
43:07 - channel or message dot channel, dot send. New 
and courage couraging message added. Oh, yeah,  
43:26 - that that should be and again, I don't know 
why keep doing that. If incursions and DB keys.  
43:37 - Okay, now we'll add the ability 
for a user to delete a message. So  
43:44 - a new function if message that starts with if 
it starts with Dell, or delete, that's what Dell  
43:52 - stands for. That starts with Dell, we're going 
to get the list of messages. encouragements or  
43:59 - we're not going to get the list of messages, we're 
just going to actually just create an empty list  
44:03 - called encouragements, because we're going to want 
to return the new list of encouragements later.  
44:10 - So we're going to start it started this with an 
empty list. And we're going to check if there's  
44:17 - any encouragement already. So if there's 
any encouragement already, in dB keys,  
44:26 - then we're going to delete one of them. First, 
we have to get the index from the command. So  
44:39 - So if matches that starts with dollar sign,  
44:47 - delete. So if it starts with Dell, Dell, that 
means delete. Then we're going to first create an  
44:56 - empty list. incur, we're going to create an eight 
encouragements variable as an empty list that we  
45:02 - will add to in a second, if encouragements, we're 
checking if the incursions are already in the  
45:09 - database. Because if there's no encourage us in 
the database, and we don't want to try to delete  
45:13 - any of them, so if it's already, whoops, we'll see 
if increments are in dB keys, then let's get the  
45:22 - index from the message that the user submitted 
through Discord. So we have to get the index,  
45:28 - or you have to split it from from 
the here. So message that split.  
45:34 - And just like before, we're going 
to, it's going to look very similar  
45:39 - Dell. And this time, adding the space there is 
optional. What let me show you what I meant.  
45:49 - So before we add a space here, this time, we don't 
necessarily have to have a space because we are  
45:56 - going to convert it to an integer. So whether 
there's a space or not, it will still correctly  
46:02 - convert to the integer, whatever not there, we're 
going to type in a number, the user is going to  
46:07 - have a number after the command del, and it's 
going to be converted to an integer in Python.  
46:13 - Now, we just need to delete the encouragement  
46:19 - that's at that index. And then finally, we need 
to get a list of all the encouragements that  
46:26 - get the liver current list after it's 
been deleted. Because we're going to  
46:30 - return that to the users so they can see 
the updated list after it's been deleted.  
46:38 - And now we are going to send that back 
a weight message dot channel dot send  
46:46 - encouragements. Okay, so the reason why we made an 
empty list here is because if there, if there's no  
46:56 - encouragement in the database already, it's just 
going to return the empty list here. But if there  
47:02 - is encouragements in the database, it will get 
those encouragements and then return return those.  
47:09 - Okay, let's test this bot. And then 
we'll add some a few extra features.  
47:15 - So I'm running the bot again.  
47:19 - Okay, the bots running and we will test 
it. So let's test the other features first.  
47:28 - We still get an inspiring message. 
Now let's try to add a new message.  
47:37 - You are amazing.  
47:46 - Okay, hi, just realized I made an error 
way up here. database has no attribute key.  
47:53 - So that's what's the key with an S at the end. 
So let's stop this again. Let's run this again.  
48:04 - That's why it's good to test frequently 
to catch these, these mistakes like this.  
48:10 - Let's go back over here. Okay, now let's try 
typing this again. Again, new, you are amazing.  
48:18 - New encouraging message added. Let's add another 
one new way to go. That may not make sense based  
48:29 - on the message that the person put in to get that 
message but that's okay. New, you are the best  
48:38 - coder in the world. Okay, now in order 
to receive get one of these messages,  
48:45 - we mean we have to have some sad words. So I am 
sad. Hang in there. We've already seen that one.  
48:52 - Let's just type in sad. Again. Way 
to go. Now, way to go. That's one  
48:56 - of our new messages. So this was one of the 
original messages, the starter encouragements,  
49:02 - but now we've received randomly one of 
our new messages. I'm not sad anymore.  
49:11 - You are a great person bought. I'm depressed. 
Well, I guess you have to spell it right.  
49:21 - Cheer up trying to see another new one.  
49:26 - You are amazing. That's another 
new one that we put in there.  
49:34 - Okay, now let's see if we can delete a message. 
So we should be able to delete a message with  
49:46 - doe. And let's just delete the 
first one. So I'll just spend zero.  
49:52 - Now it's going to return the messages that 
are left. Now just way to go and you are the  
49:57 - best coder in the world. It doesn't have a 
me So that one was deleted. So that worked.  
50:03 - Right now the only way you can see all the 
messages that are all the user submitted messages  
50:09 - is to delete one, it would be nice to be able to 
see the user submitted messages without having to  
50:16 - delete one. So let's add some additional 
features. Let's go back over to the bot.  
50:23 - So after adding the ability to get 
a list of user submitted messages,  
50:27 - from right from discord, we're going to add 
the ability to turn off and on whether the  
50:32 - bot responds to sad words. So you will be able 
to actually update that right from discord,  
50:37 - whether it's going to be responding or not. 
So we're going to kind of do all that at once.  
50:45 - First of all, we are going to create 
a new key value pair in the database.  
50:52 - So right after the starter encouragements, we're 
going to check if responding is in the database  
51:00 - yet. So this is gonna be a new key in the database 
responding. If it's not in the database, db keys,  
51:11 - then we're going to add it. And it's 
going to default it's going to start off  
51:16 - by being true respond, thing equals true. 
And we do need to put a colon right here.  
51:32 - And now we only want to respond if this is true. 
So down here, where it responds to words. That's  
51:42 - this whole section right here is when it's 
is when it's responding to the sad word. So  
51:49 - I'm going to press tab here, because this is 
all going to be inside an if statement. If  
51:58 - dB, we're going to get the value of the 
responding key in the database responding.  
52:03 - So if that's true, then it will respond to the sad 
words. If not, it won't respond to the sad words.  
52:13 - In a minute, we will add the 
ability to update this value.  
52:20 - So let's go back before we add 
the ability to update that value,  
52:23 - we're going to add the ability to list encouraging 
messages. So if message that starts with  
52:32 - me, maybe like guess what the user command 
is gonna be used, it's gonna be a list.  
52:36 - So if the user, the user types in list into 
discord, then first of all we're going to get  
52:46 - we're going to make a empty list encouragements 
equals an empty list because there may not be any  
52:52 - encouragements in the list yet. So we're going to 
check if encouragements is in dB keys with an S.  
53:06 - Then encouragements, we're 
going to add them we're going to  
53:09 - set the encouragements in the database to 
the incursions, variable DB encouragements  
53:20 - and then we just have to return the 
encouragements. So Oh, wait that message  
53:25 - or send the message to the channel. That send and 
encouragements. Okay, now, users should be able  
53:35 - to get a list of the encouragements. Now we're 
going to have the feature of changing whether  
53:42 - the bot is going to respond to sad words 
or not. So if message that starts with risk  
53:55 - responding, quotation mark responding,  
54:05 - then we're going to get the value. So the idea 
is that the user is going to put responding true  
54:11 - or responding false, if the discord message 
that the bot is going to receive as a command.  
54:17 - So if a nano value, we're gonna get the value that 
the user typed in, so is it true or false split  
54:25 - we're going to do just like before responding. 
And again, we're going to put responding space  
54:34 - because we don't want this space right after 
that. So we want the first element in that array,  
54:44 - which is the second the second element of the 
array and index one. So we got the value. So now  
54:50 - if value dot lower, no matter if they typed 
in lowercase or uppercase, we're going to  
54:57 - convert it to lowercase. So if it equals True, 
then we're going to make sure that DB responding  
55:13 - equals true. And then let me scroll down 
a little bit here. We're going to send  
55:21 - the message message back to Discord. Oh, wait. 
Message dot channel dot send. Responding is on.  
55:39 - Okay, we're gonna have an else, I'm just gonna 
copy this whole thing. So if valued at lower does  
55:46 - not equal true. I'll just change this to else. 
We're actually making it so the person doesn't  
55:54 - actually have to type in false anything 
but true will be assumed to be false. So  
56:01 - encouraging, responding is going to be set to 
false. And it's going to say responding is off.  
56:09 - The code for the bot is complete. 
This is all we're adding to the bot.  
56:15 - We're not quite done, though. We're 
not quite done. We're going to test it.  
56:18 - And then I'm going to tell you 
about one more very important  
56:21 - step. So let's try this. Let's go to back to 
our bot. Oh, we have to run the bot again.  
56:35 - Okay, the bot is running. Hey, 
bot. I am sad. Okay, it added that  
56:46 - now let's get a list of our messages. 
Remember sent is stored in the database.  
56:50 - There should still be messages. Yep. See, 
these are the messages messages we added before  
56:55 - the last time we ran our bot. But since it 
stored in the database, they get stored dependent  
57:00 - between times that you've run your your code. So 
let's add one. Oh, put add. Nice. I'm just nice.  
57:17 - Oh, I did that wrong. It's actually supposed to 
be new. Make sure you type in the commands, right.  
57:23 - And let's list them again. Show is 
nice. Now let's delete something delete  
57:30 - index one that should be the middle one. And Yep, 
it shows them that we can even list them again.  
57:37 - Now let's see if we can change turn off and on 
whether the body's responding. Let's confirm  
57:44 - that the bot is responding. I'm sad. Nice, huh? 
Maybe it's saying nice because the data said it's  
57:52 - hard to tell with this bot. But let's see if we 
can turn off the messages. So responding false.  
58:01 - If I type in sad, and it doesn't say anything, 
if I type in depressed, it doesn't say anything.  
58:08 - But if I do responding, true. 
Okay, let's do say I am depressed.  
58:25 - Okay, the bot thinks that's pretty nice. Now, 
since we created the responding variable in the  
58:32 - database, it will save weather between times even 
if you shut down your bot and rerun it, it will  
58:38 - still save whether it's supposed to be responding 
or not. Okay, so technically, our bot is done,  
58:46 - but you don't want to stop now. Because if I close 
my tab, the bot will just stop running. And then  
58:54 - it's not gonna work. If I close my browser, the 
bots gonna stop running, it's not gonna work.  
58:59 - There is a workaround repple it will continue 
running a web server even after the tab is closed.  
59:07 - Now this is not a web server. But we can 
create one to run it at the same time as this.  
59:14 - But even a web server will only run 
for up to an hour without any use. Oh,  
59:20 - here's the rep docs about the web servers. See 
it says once deployed, the server will continue  
59:25 - to run in the background even after you close the 
browser tab. The server will stay awake and active  
59:31 - until an hour after its last request after 
which it will enter a sleeping stage.  
59:37 - So even if you have a web server web server 
running, it will eventually stop running after an  
59:44 - hour after its last request. So if nobody's 
using the disk or bottles have stopped working.  
59:49 - However, there is a way to make the bot 
continually get requests so it never shuts down.  
59:56 - So actually rip rebel has announced that in 
the future They will offer a paid plan that  
60:01 - allows code run continuously, no matter what 
it will just never enter the sleeping sage.  
60:07 - But they don't offer that quite yet. It's 
coming very soon, maybe it'll be available  
60:11 - by the time you see this video. But until that 
is implemented, there is another way to keep  
60:16 - your bot running longer than an hour. And this 
method even works with the free tier of replicas.  
60:22 - So to keep this bot running continuously, 
we're going to use another free service called  
60:27 - uptime robot, up and rollback can be set to ping 
the bots web server on replica every five minutes  
60:34 - with constant pings, the bot will never enter the 
sleeping stage, and will just keep running. So we  
60:40 - have two more things to do to make sure our bot 
is working as we want to make sure it's working  
60:46 - running continuously. We're going to create a web 
server and repple it and set up uptime robot to  
60:53 - continuously ping the web server. Okay, creating 
the web server is simpler than you may think. To  
61:00 - do it, we're going to create a new file, so 
go to files and click the Add File button.  
61:05 - And this is just going to be called keep alive.pi. 
Because the whole purpose of the web server  
61:13 - is to keep keep everything alive. Okay, I'm just 
gonna paste in the code from the web server here.  
61:21 - It's pretty simple. Like I said, and it's not, 
it's not really specifically important for the  
61:27 - bot, it's just a thing that we do in replique, to 
make it keep going. So I will have a link to the  
61:33 - text of this web server right in the description 
here. So you can just copy and paste it also.  
61:38 - But you can see it's not that long. So in 
this code, we're going to import flask,  
61:43 - and we're going to use flask as the web server. 
And it's going to return Hello, I'm alive to  
61:49 - anyone who visits the server, the server will run 
on a separate thread from our bot, the server is  
61:58 - going to run on a separate thread from robot, 
so they can both be running at the same time.  
62:04 - But the rest of this is not really relevant to our 
bot, we just need the bot to run this web server.  
62:11 - So let's go back into main.pi. And then at the 
top, we're going to have to import it. So from  
62:22 - keep alive, import, keep alive. And if you just 
go back over here, that that it's importing this,  
62:30 - which is this is what runs our web server here. So 
from it's going to import the web server, and then  
62:38 - we're going to go all the way to the bottom. And 
right before the client runs, we're going to call  
62:44 - keep alive. And this will run our web server. 
So if I stopped the bot and rerun the bot,  
62:53 - it's something different is going to happen 
because of the bot because of the web server.  
62:59 - Okay, you can see a new window open right up here.  
63:03 - And this is our web server running and see 
how it says Hello, I'm alive. That's from  
63:08 - our web server code where it says return Hello, 
I'm alive. So whenever you go to the server,  
63:13 - it says Hello, I'm alive. Now the important 
thing here is this URL. So this URL was created.  
63:20 - And this is the URL that we are going to ping from 
uptime robot. So I'm going to copy this URL right  
63:29 - here. And then we're going to use it in the next 
section. So now we need to set up uptime robot.  
63:37 - So the first step is to create a 
free account, and then get logged in.  
63:46 - Okay, once you're logged into uptime robot, 
just click add new monitor for the monitor type,  
63:53 - https and the friendly name, you can 
name this anything we're gonna just put,  
63:58 - bought. And then for the URL, this is where 
you paste in the URL that you copied all  
64:03 - over from repel repple it and the monitoring 
interval we'll just leave this the same as  
64:08 - every five minutes. And then create, 
monitor and then create monitor again  
64:16 - monitor created so I can close this. And 
we should be able to see it right here.  
64:21 - Here it is. This is now going to ping our 
bot every five minutes. So at this point,  
64:30 - it's going to be continuing, continuing 
continue to run even after we close our tab  
64:37 - and even after an hour. Even if there's no 
activity in discord, this bot will just run  
64:44 - continuously. Let's just try closing the 
tab really quick. I'm just gonna copy this  
64:49 - URL, close a tab. Let's see if we 
can just open the tab back up on here  
64:58 - and you can see it's still running 
still running in this right here.  
65:02 - It could mean it is going to say something 
like this every time it's pinged.  
65:06 - I don't know if that's from the ping 
or not, or if it's just from reloading.  
65:12 - But we are now done. Now the bot will run 
continuously, so people can always interact with  
65:18 - it on replicat. It's time for a bonus section, you 
already know how to set up a Python bot and run  
65:26 - it continuously from repple it. Now I'm going 
to show you how to set up another discord bot  
65:31 - to work with web hooks. We are going to connect 
the bot to GitHub so that the bot will post a  
65:37 - message to your server whenever a certain GitHub 
repository is updated. And for this GitHub bot,  
65:44 - you don't even need to code anything, or hosted 
anywhere. Let me show you how it works. Okay,  
65:50 - to add this GitHub bot, we'll go to our server. 
And then we'll go to the server settings here.  
65:58 - And then we'll click integrations. And 
then there's web hooks create web hook.  
66:05 - And instead of calling it Captain Hook, I'm 
going to name it. I'll name it GitHub. Okay,  
66:14 - and we'll put it in the general channel. 
And then I'll just copy the webhook URL.  
66:22 - Okay, I'll make sure to save.  
66:25 - Okay, now I'm gonna go over to the GitHub 
repo that I want to connect with this bot.  
66:30 - So I'm going to use the free code camp.org 
GitHub repo. And then I'll go to Settings.  
66:39 - And then on the side here, it says web hooks. 
Okay, now I'm going to click Add web hook.  
66:48 - And then I'm just going to paste in the URL that I 
copied from Discord. Now here's an important part,  
66:54 - you can't just use the URL, you also have to 
add something, I'm gonna add slash GitHub at  
67:00 - the end of the URL. And then for the content 
type, I'll change it to application slash JSON,  
67:06 - and they'll scroll down. And for what 
event should trigger the web hook,  
67:11 - I'm gonna do send me everything. Depending on what 
you're trying to do, you may want to do just the  
67:15 - push event or select individual events. But I'm 
gonna do everything. So I'll add the web hook.  
67:23 - And now I can go back right over 
to my discord channel. If I wait,  
67:30 - we should start to see some events happening 
on the from the Free Code Camp GitHub repo.  
67:45 - Let me go and just try to make an event 
happen. I'll just unstarred star the repo.  
67:53 - And it worked. We just got a message 
from the GitHub bot, new star added.  
68:00 - So now we've connected our bot 
to GitHub through web hooks.  
68:05 - And the GitHub bot will post a message 
whenever anything happens on the GitHub repo.  
68:12 - You can create bots to work with a lot of other 
external services with web hooks. Okay, you've  
68:20 - reached the end of this tutorial. Now you've 
prepared to go out and code your own discord bot.

Cleaned transcript:

Hi, I'm Beau Carnes with Free Code Camp. In this tutorial that you're watching right now, I'm going to show you how to create a discord bot with Python that runs completely in the cloud. You don't need to install anything on your computer, and you don't need to pay anything to host your bot. We're gonna use a number of tools, including the discord API, some Python libraries, and a cloud computing platform called repple it you probably already know what discord is, and what a discord bot is, since you're watching this tutorial, but just in case you don't let me give you a brief overview. discord is an app used for real time text chat, discord servers are set up by people and generally are focused on a certain community. Many groups and organizations have discord servers for people to chat with each other. A Discord server often has many channels, which are different rooms that you can chat in. A discord bot is a user in your Discord server that is controlled by a program instead of a person. You can code a discord bot to make it do whatever you want. There are many things discord bots are often used for. They can be used to chat, respond to messages, manage servers, play music, and more. You can also use web hooks with a discord bot to do things like give real time updates on a GitHub repository. The first step for creating a discord bot is to make sure you have a Discord server to add the bot to you may already have one. But let me just show you how to set one up really quick in case you don't already have one. So you're going to have to go to discord comm and log into Discord. And then you just click the plus button here to add a server. And I'll say for me and my friends, and I'll just call it robot family server. Okay, let's create that. And now we have our server. Okay, so before we can code our bot using Python, and using the discord API, we must first create a discord bot account right within Discord. So you're going to have to go to the discord developer portal. I'll put the link in the description, but it's just discord comm slash developers slash applications. So once you're on the applications page, you're going to click this new applications button. And then we're going to create a name for it. This bot is going to send friendly encouragements to people from in Discord. So I'm going to call it encourage bot. Okay, I'll create that. Okay, now I'm going to go to the bot tab here. And then I am going to click Add bot and say yes, do it. Okay, we'll keep the default the default settings as a public bot, and then we won't require the OAuth to grant the code grant. So now the bot has been created. The next step is to copy the bot token. Okay, so I'll just click Copy to copy the token, we're going to need that later. Now this token is your bots password. So make sure not to share it with anybody. It could allow someone to log into your bot and do all sorts of bad things. And it could even allow someone to mess with your server. And also, you can obviously regenerate the token if they accidentally get shared. So now we have to invite the bot to our server, we have the bot user, and we have to get into our server. To do that, we're going to have to create an invite URL for it. So let's go to the off to tab here. And now we're just gonna go to the scope section. Since this is a bot, we'll just click Buy here. Now we have to scroll down a little bit more and go to the bot permissions section. So we'll choose the permissions we want for the bot. Our bot is going to be mainly used for text messages. So we don't need a lot of permissions. So your bot may do different things. But let's just choose some of these here. Actually, we'll do all of them on this line, except send TTS messages. Now you do need to be careful with this administrator permissions. If you give your bot administrative permissions it has, it will be able to control your server in ways that you may not actually want. And then I guess the last one we need to add is the view channels or bots going to have to view the channels. So after selecting the appropriate permissions, we'll click the Copy button right here. And this will copy a URL that can be used to add the bot to a server. And I guess we'll also have to recopy the back key, we copy the back key earlier, but now it's been re copied with this URL. So we'll have to come back later to get the back key. But now let's just open up a new tab and I'm going to go to this URL Okay, so now we have to choose the server, we want to add the bot to I'll choose robot family server, the only option, but you will probably have more than more options. So we'll click Continue. And we want to approve that we want to do all these things, we want to authorize the bot for all these things. And I'm not a robot and the bot is authorized. That means the bot has joined the server. So if we actually go over into our server, we can see encouraged bot just slid into the server. But also you see over here that the bot is offline, it's not going to be online till we write our Python code that creates the bot and run the Python code. And speaking of Python code, it's time to start that. Now I said earlier that you don't have to install anything, you don't have to use any software except your web browser, we are going to be creating the entire discord bot, right in the cloud on replique. The website for replique is our epl.it. And replique is an online ID EA, that you can just use in your web browser. So it makes it a lot easier to code things if you don't have to install any special software on your computer. And then you can log into it from multiple browsers, multiple computers, and then you can easily access your code and your programs no matter what computer you're using. So we're gonna make our button this and then it will also be completely hosted in the cloud, we can even run the bot on this website, so we don't have to run it on our local computer. And that will make it so we can keep the bot running, even if our computer shuts down, or we're gonna where we close the browser tab or anything like that, I'll show you how to make the bot. So it'll keep running in the background continuously. And then you don't have to worry about it. If you don't already have account, you're going to sign up. But I'm going to log in here. Okay, now that I'm logged in, and I click this new repple in the corner here, now we just have to create, choose the language that we're going to use for this new repple. The cool thing about repple it is that you can use a bunch of different languages with it. And so that makes it simple. If you're going to run some of these languages on your computer, you probably are going to have to install some extra software or extra things on your computer to be able to run these languages. But if you just go to repple, it, you can just do it right in your browser. And you don't have to install anything. But we're going to be doing this in Python. So I'll click Python. And it will have a default name here. But I'm just going to be calling it encouraged. Okay, and I'll just create the repple. So let's go over the main part of Rep. What we have here, which is right here is the code editor. And you can see a default with a file open called main.py. And we can type our Python code right in here. And then here over here are the files, and you can create new files, we will be creating a few new files in the course of creating this bot, you can also create new folders. And then over here is the console. The console is where the standard output will appear. And you'll be prompted to enter input if you're going to have input in your code. And in Python, it's going to it's going to double as an interactive prompt. So you can actually type in Python code right here. And it will evaluate the code interactively. So that's pretty cool. And then over here, we have some things on the side here. so files, version control, if you're going to associate with git, and or we're not going to do that in this tutorial, though. And then if you're going to install packages, but there's also another way to install patches that we'll see. And then the main thing we're actually going to be using is the replique database. So one thing cool about replique is it includes a database as part of it. And so you can easily store things that will keep stored in there even if you stop your program and run it again the everything store in the database will will still be in there. So we will be using that later in this tutorial. And then you can also change some settings, just like the theme of font size, all sorts of stuff like that. But let's go back to the files because we are going to start creating our discord bot right now. So I mentioned that we are going to be using the discord.py library. And the first thing we're going to do is import that library. So at the top has this do import Discord. And the cool thing here is that in repple it it will automatically install this dependency when you press the Run button. So I mean my permanent and do very much right now but if I click Run, we'll see on the side here, that it's Installing the discord despit dependency, and then it will be able to use it in the program right away. So there's nothing extra you have to do to install dependencies besides just importing them right in your program. So let me talk a little bit about discord.pi. Before we continue with this bot here, it revolves around the concept of events, and event, it's something you listen to and then respond to. For example, when a message happens in discord, you will receive an event about it that you can respond to it. So let's make a bot that replies to a specific message, we're going to start with a very simple bot, and then we're going to add to it and just add more features as we go. So the simple bot that we're going to start with the code is actually taken directly from the discord.pi documentation. It's a really good example of like the most basic bot you can make. And like I said, then we'll continue to build on that after we get this simple bot created. Okay, so we got the discord library, imported. So let's add some more lines here. So now we are going to create an instance of a client. This is the connection to Discord. So do a client equals discord dot client. This is just part of the discord.py library. Now, we are going to use the client that event decorator to register an event that looks like this. So I remember I mentioned that this client uses events to make it work. So this is how you register an event. And this is an asynchronous library discord, that pie. So things are done with callbacks. a callback is a function that is called when something else happens. So in this code, where you're going to use the unready event, so I'm going to put async. def on ready. So this event is going to be called when the bot is ready to start being used. And when it's start, when it's ready, when the bot is ready, we're going to do this print. And this is going to print right to this console right here. So when the bot is run and ready to be used, it's going to print this to the console, it's going to say we have logged in as and then we're going to actually be able to get the username that's logged in as, and this is how you do that. So there's a few ways to do it. But so this is taking the client, this zero is being replaced with the client. So it's doing the client that user So that's this client, this zero gets replaced with this client here as client, that user to get the username. And to make sure I have this right next to the quote goes here. And there we go. Okay, let's create another event. So that's the event that happens as soon as the bot is ready, and it's working. So the next event is if it receives a message, if the bot senses a message right in the discord server. So it's going to start off just the same to register the event. And we're going to do another async function. But this one is on message. So these function names are specifically from the discord.pi library, it's looking for these function names, to know what to do, when certain things happen. This onmessage event triggers each time a message is received. But we don't want to do anything if the message is from ourselves, which is the bot. If the message is from the bot, we want to do nothing. And this event takes an argument called message. Or you can call it anything you want. But it's traditional to call a message because it's the message that's being received. So this event triggers each time a message is received. But we don't want it to do anything. If the message is from ourselves, we're gonna make it check if the message is from ourselves. So if message dot author equals client, that user looks like I spelled something wrong there. So if the author of the message is the user, our bot user, all we're going to do is return. Next thing we're going to do is we're going to see if the message starts with a command that's being sent to our discord bot. And we can make up those commands to be anything we want. So in this case, I'll show you we're going to do if message dot content that starts starts with and we're just going to make it up to be dollar sign Hello. For our bot. We're going to say all the commands are messages that start with the dollar sign. So if the message starts With dollar sign Hello, then the boss should know that it's received a command so it should return something. And to return a message back to discord, we're going to await message dot channel dot send. So this is going to send a message to the channel. And the message is going to be Hello. Okay, so now so whenever the bot notices that someone says dollar sign Hello within discord, it's going to respond Hello with an exclamation point. So this is everything we need for the bot. But we still have to run the bot. So here's the line to run the bot client dot run. And then right in the client that run we need to put our token, we need to put our bots token which is like the password for the bot. Before we just go and copy the token again and put it right in here, there's something I should tell you about replica that you need to be careful with. By default, all replicates are public, they're visible to anyone. So anyone can just access your replica. And they could potentially see anything you put in your replica, including any secrets or keys. And remember, I told you that this key is like a password, you don't want anybody else to find out about it. But there is a way to keep things secret. And that is to use an environment variable. So in repple, it let me show you how you can use environment variables, we are going to first of all, create a new file here. And the new file is going to be called dot E and V. So that anything we put in a dot E and V file will not be made public, nobody will be able to see anything in a dot E and V file in replique, pretty much on a public account on a free tier account. Everything is public always except just this one file dot E and V, we're gonna put token equals, and we're gonna set the token to equal our token. Now we're gonna have to go back and get our token. So let's go back to our development portal page, the discord comm slash developers, and then I'm gonna go to bot gonna copy the token. And then we will go back over here. Okay, there's my token. I'm going to disable this bot later and change the token. So don't bother trying to figure it out to use it for your own code. But now that we have our token, we have to make it so it gets into our main file. So to do that, we are going to have to do have another import statement here. So I'm going to put import OS, and then down here, we need to access that token from the dot EMB file. So what we're going to put in our code here is oh s dot get e and V. And then I'm going to put token. Now the reason why it's token here is because that's the name I put right here, you can actually use any name for the token doesn't have to be token, you just have to make sure that when you're getting the environment variable, you use the same name here. So now when you run the code, it's just going to replace this right here with your token. Now, if you're doing this locally, or you're doing in such a way where you know, nobody else is ever gonna see this code, you can actually put your token right in here. And you don't even have to import o 's here. But since we're doing it in a public way, we need to make sure that nobody else sees our token, or else they could get access to our bot. And that's actually it for our basic bot. Like I said, we're going to add some more additional features later. But let's run it now and test this out. So click run here. Okay, look, we have logged in as encouraged bot. Now let's go to our server. You can see look before it showed as logged out, but now it shows it as logged in. So let me let's try this. I'll say hello. Now you can see that's from from me, and it didn't respond. Because remember, the special command is actually dollar sign Hello. So let's try that. And it works encouraged by just responded with Hello. So our bot works if we do another command like Hi, how are you or not not another command another message? It's not going to respond at all. But if we do the dollar sign Hello. Then it will respond. So we just created a basic discord bot that responds to the command dollar sign Hello. And obviously you can make it any command. So if you don't want to respond to dollar sign Hello, you can actually use any command here. And then you can change what it's going to respond with. Now that we have our basic bot working, we'll improve it. I said it's called encouraged bot for a reason, the bot will respond with a message of encouragement. Whenever someone sends a message containing a sad or depressing word, we're gonna make it so anyone will be able to add encouraging messages for the bot to use. And these messages will be stored in a database. So they will save even after you stop and start your bot. We're also going to add another thing in the database. That turns on whether that turns on or off whether the bot is is responding to messages. And an extra feature of encouragement we're going to do is that the bot is going to return a random inspirational quote from an API, when someone types the message, dollar sign inspire into the chat. So let's start with that last thing I said, we're going to start by adding the dollar sign spider feature. I found this API called Zim quotes.io. That will return inspirational quotes. Now, you can use any API. So if you don't want to use in quotes.io, you can just find a different one. If somehow this isn't working, just try to find a different API, but we're going to use is in quotes.io. And a lot of these principles will apply to really any API that you're using. So let's go back to our bot. And we are going to import some new things to work with this API. So what we're going to do is we're going to import a couple more Python modules, we're going to add a get quote function. And we're going to update our bot code to call the function. So let's import requests. This request module allows your code to make an HTTP request to get data from the API. The API returns JSON. So we're going to have to import the JSON module. What because that's going to make it easier to work with the data that's returned. Okay, now we're going to add a helper function. It's called get, quote, this is a function we can call to return a quote from the API. So first, we're going to use the request module to request data from the API URL. So that's going to go like this, the response we're going to store the response from the API in a variable called response. And so we have to use the request module like this request that get we're going to make a get request to this URL. Now, I just had to find this URL by looking at the documentation of this in quotes API. So HTTP, S, colon slash slash is in quotes.io. Slash API slash random, it's going to return a random quote. Okay, now we're going to convert that response into JSON. So we're going to do JSON, data equals JSON dot loads, response, that text. So this response that text, I just had to look in the documentation of the API, and found out that the response is going to have this response that text that I can, I can load into JSON. So now we have to do something with this JSON, we have to get the quote out of it. Now, this was a lot of trial and error, I had to print out the JSON data and try to figure out how how to get the exact part of that JSON that I needed. So so this is what what we ended up with, quote, equals JSON data. Zero, Q. Now, that's going to be the quote q stands for a quote. And it's just something that's part of this in quotes API, the result that's returned from this API is going to have a key called q when the value is going to be the quote. So we're going to start with the quote, but then we want to add after the quote, the author of the quote who said it. So I'm just going to add a plus we're going to do some string concatenate Nathan here. And I'm going to make it have a space after the quote, and it's going to be a dash, the dash is going to be right before the person's name. It's just a way to kind of show who's who's doing the quote. So we'll do another plus here. And let's go back into the JSON data. And this time, instead of the queue, we're going to do a for author. Okay, so we got a quote in here. Now, I can return the quote. Okay, now we have to update our bot. So it uses this get, quote function to get a quote, and then return the quote, as a message to Discord. Let me scroll down a little bit here. So now I'm just going to update these lines here. This was just an example to rich to respond to the message Hello. But that's not what our final bot is going to do. So I'm going to change this to inspire. And let's move this over a little bit. So we can see more of the code. So if the bot gets this message inspire, we're going to send a quote. So the way we're going to send a quote is first adding another line. So I'm gonna put quote, equals get, quote. So it's going to call the get, quote, function and return the quote here. And now I can just return the quote, or I can send the quote to Discord. Okay, at this point, we can run the code and try it out. If it's already running, we got to stop it, and then run it again. And then we have to wait till it says it's logged as encouraged bot. That means we can go back to our Discord server, and say, Hi, bot doesn't say anything. Let's see if it will say, Hello, hello. Okay, that command doesn't work anymore. Because we change it. Let's do inspire. Okay, we have an inspirational quote. And let's try inspire a few more times to see if it's random. There's another one. There's another one. See, we're getting a random quote, for every time we do it. So this is the quote part by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail. And then we add that the space and then the dash, and then the author Benjamin Franklin. Okay, well, that works. Let's go, go back to our bytecode. Now we're going to implement the feature where the bot responds with encouraging messages when a user posts a message with a sad word. So in this, this time, the user isn't putting a certain command into discord to get a result. This time, the bot is going to be checking every word in every message to see if there's a sad word. And if it's if it notices a sad word, it's going to return an encouraging message. So the first thing we're going to do is to create a Python list that contains the sad words that the bot will respond to. So right after the client variable is created, I'm going to create another one called sad. Words. And the CI word. This is just going to be a list like I said, oops, there we go. depressed, unhappy. Now I'm gonna have a list of words here, you can add additional words. Really, you can put any words you like on this list here. I'll have a miserable. And let's do one more. How about depressing? Okay, so we are going to make it so whenever the bot sees one of these words in the message, it's going to respond. So what is the bot going to respond with? Well, now we're going to add a list of encouraging messages that the spot will respond with when it sees one of those words. So I'm going to make a new variable called starter and encouragements. Now, I'll tell you why this is called starter encouragements. It's because these are the there's going to be just a few encouragements that the bat starts with, but users will be able to add more encouragement later that are stored in the database. So the start encouragements I'm just gonna do a cheer up. Hang in there. And you are a great person, or maybe it's just another bot. So we'll do person slash bot Feel free to add any number of encourages you like, and remember later, user will be able to add more encouragements. Now we need to update our bot to use the two lists that we just created. So the first thing we're going to do is import the random module, because the bot will be choosing messages randomly. So import random. And we'll be using this later the random module to make it get the random message. So we're going to update the on message response here, we're going to add something on in this on message async function, that's gonna check all the messages to see if they contain a word from the sad words list. And then if the sad word is found, the bot will send a random message of encouragement. So here's the code for that. After we check to see if it has starts with inspire, then we're going to check just if it has any other word from the sad word list. So this is how we're gonna do if any, if any weight, if any word in message for word and sad words. So this just means it's going to go through every word, and the sad words. And gonna see if any of those words are in the message. If it sees any of the word in the sad words in the message, then it's going to Oh, wait. Message dot channel dot send. This is just like this line above here. And what is it going to send, it's going to send random dot choice, it's going to choose a random choice from starter encouragements from that list that we created. Okay, we can test the button Now, let's see if there's something wrong here. undefined name message. Okay, got it. I got ahead of myself here. Actually, this message should be, it's actually supposed to be message content by switch to message, because since we're going to be using message content a bunch of times, what I want to do actually, is create the message variable right here message equals message content. And then anytime we see message content, we can switch it with message here. Okay, let's test the bot now. Okay, let's go back over here. Let's see if the Inspire still works. Worked. Now let's check the sad word. I am sad. You're a great person bet Brett person's life spot. Well, now, I am depressed. Hang in there. Oh, that's making me that is making me feel much better. Thanks. This encouraging by is very encouraging. So it's working, it can now respond, whenever it sees sees a stad method, it's going to try to encourage the person that put that sad message. So at this point, you basically know enough to create your own bot. But let's keep going because we're going to add some more advanced features that I already discussed. Now let's make it possible to update the bot right from Discord. A user should be able to add more encouraging messages for the bot to use when it detects a sad word. Like I mentioned before, we're going to use repple. It's built in database to store user submitted messages. This database is a key value store that's built into every rebel. So let's add that to our code. Now. Now, I showed you this before this tab here, this the only really the only point of this tab is to just show you the commands the most common commands for the database. And you don't actually need to get in from here if you already know him because this type of men, but let's go to the top of the code and we're going to Alka just insert this so I inserted from replique import dB. This allows us to use the replicate database. Before we add new commands for the bot. Let's add two helper functions that the first one will be able to add custom messages to the database. And the second helper function will be used to delete messages from the database. So let's go under the get quote function. This new function is going to be called update encouragements. So that's gonna it's going to update the encouragements in the database. And it's going to accept an encouraging message as an argument. So first, it's going to check if encouragement is a key in the database. So if encouragements do that, right, encourage myths is in dB keys. So DB keys just returns a list of the keys in the database. So if increment is already in the keys, it's going to get those all the key all the incursions are already in the database. encouragements equals the way to get a value from the database that stored under a certain key is like this DB encouragements. Okay, so we've gotten the encouragement. Now we just have to add the new encouragement to this list. So encouragements dot append that's going to add something new to this list. And we're going to type in the encouraging message, which is the argument that was passed into this function. And then after we append the new encouraging message to the old encouraging messages, we have to save it again into the database. So DB encouragements equals encouragements. Else, if there's not already encouraged us in the database, then we're going to have to create it. So dB, encouragements equals, and we're going to put a bracket here because this is going to be a list, but it's only going to have one message. And the one message is the encouraging message that was passed into this function. Okay, so now, let's see what we did wrong up here. Okay, that's supposed to be if encouragements in dB key not is I just excellent typed an essence of it in. So that's supposed to be in. Okay, so now, we finished our helper function, let's create a new one, which is to delete an encouraging message. So def delete, encouragement. And it's going to take an index, as is an argument, the index of the message to delete. So first, we need to get a list of the messages from the database. So encouragement equals dB. encouragement. So we got the list of encouragement from the database. Now we have to check if the length of encouragement is more than the index, because the person could pass in an index that's, that's actually not in that that list. The person could pass in an index that's actually not part of the list. So if the length of encouragements is more than the index, then we're going to delete DLS. Delete. We're going to delete the encouragements at that index. And finally, we are going to save it into the database again equals encouragements. And this can actually be in this if statement. Okay. Done. We can now add an encouragement and delete and encouragement. Now let's update our bot code to use these functions. So users and discord can update encouragements and delete encouragements, right from Discord. Let's go down here. So the first thing we're going to do, if you remember, currently, it returns a choice from the starter encouragements if it sees a sad word. But we want to also be able to return a random we want the random encouragement to also be able to come from the database. So let's add some code to be able to use the starter encouragements with any encouragement that has been added to the database. So first of all, I'm going to create a new variable options equals starter encouragements. Okay, so now, if there are if there's any incursions in the data in the in the database, if encourage meant in dB keys, then we can, we can add those to the options. So options equals options plus DB encouragements. Okay, so now instead of picking from starter encouragements, we're going to pick from options of encouragement to return. Now we're going to add some code to add a new user submitted message to the database. So it's going to be looking for a new, a new command. So if the message from discord starts with the command, knew, if it starts with the command new, that means it's going to be a new message to add to the database. So the command that the bot is going to be looking for is the command dollar sign new, but then in the same message that you that the user puts dollar sign new, they're going to put a space, and then they're going to put the new encouraging message. So we need to break off the encouraging message from the the new command because we don't want to add the new command to the database, we just want whatever text comes after the dollar sign new, whatever text that the user submits, after DOS, I knew we want to add that to the database. So let's do let's get the encouraging message. And the couraging message is going is going to equal message dot split, we're going to split off the message from New. So we're gonna do dollar sign new. Okay, so we are now going to get an array of the message that splits at New. And so we're getting the second element in the array. And that second element of the array is going to be the new message. Now you can see that we're not just splitting at New, we're splitting up new space. So there's a space after that, because we don't want the user is going to put dollar side new space and then the message and we don't want to add the space to the database. We just want the message after the database or after New. So we got the new encouraging message. And now we just need to update the encouragement with that new encouraging message. Then we want to send something back to the user so they know that it worked correctly. So wait channel or message dot channel, dot send. New and courage couraging message added. Oh, yeah, that that should be and again, I don't know why keep doing that. If incursions and DB keys. Okay, now we'll add the ability for a user to delete a message. So a new function if message that starts with if it starts with Dell, or delete, that's what Dell stands for. That starts with Dell, we're going to get the list of messages. encouragements or we're not going to get the list of messages, we're just going to actually just create an empty list called encouragements, because we're going to want to return the new list of encouragements later. So we're going to start it started this with an empty list. And we're going to check if there's any encouragement already. So if there's any encouragement already, in dB keys, then we're going to delete one of them. First, we have to get the index from the command. So So if matches that starts with dollar sign, delete. So if it starts with Dell, Dell, that means delete. Then we're going to first create an empty list. incur, we're going to create an eight encouragements variable as an empty list that we will add to in a second, if encouragements, we're checking if the incursions are already in the database. Because if there's no encourage us in the database, and we don't want to try to delete any of them, so if it's already, whoops, we'll see if increments are in dB keys, then let's get the index from the message that the user submitted through Discord. So we have to get the index, or you have to split it from from the here. So message that split. And just like before, we're going to, it's going to look very similar Dell. And this time, adding the space there is optional. What let me show you what I meant. So before we add a space here, this time, we don't necessarily have to have a space because we are going to convert it to an integer. So whether there's a space or not, it will still correctly convert to the integer, whatever not there, we're going to type in a number, the user is going to have a number after the command del, and it's going to be converted to an integer in Python. Now, we just need to delete the encouragement that's at that index. And then finally, we need to get a list of all the encouragements that get the liver current list after it's been deleted. Because we're going to return that to the users so they can see the updated list after it's been deleted. And now we are going to send that back a weight message dot channel dot send encouragements. Okay, so the reason why we made an empty list here is because if there, if there's no encouragement in the database already, it's just going to return the empty list here. But if there is encouragements in the database, it will get those encouragements and then return return those. Okay, let's test this bot. And then we'll add some a few extra features. So I'm running the bot again. Okay, the bots running and we will test it. So let's test the other features first. We still get an inspiring message. Now let's try to add a new message. You are amazing. Okay, hi, just realized I made an error way up here. database has no attribute key. So that's what's the key with an S at the end. So let's stop this again. Let's run this again. That's why it's good to test frequently to catch these, these mistakes like this. Let's go back over here. Okay, now let's try typing this again. Again, new, you are amazing. New encouraging message added. Let's add another one new way to go. That may not make sense based on the message that the person put in to get that message but that's okay. New, you are the best coder in the world. Okay, now in order to receive get one of these messages, we mean we have to have some sad words. So I am sad. Hang in there. We've already seen that one. Let's just type in sad. Again. Way to go. Now, way to go. That's one of our new messages. So this was one of the original messages, the starter encouragements, but now we've received randomly one of our new messages. I'm not sad anymore. You are a great person bought. I'm depressed. Well, I guess you have to spell it right. Cheer up trying to see another new one. You are amazing. That's another new one that we put in there. Okay, now let's see if we can delete a message. So we should be able to delete a message with doe. And let's just delete the first one. So I'll just spend zero. Now it's going to return the messages that are left. Now just way to go and you are the best coder in the world. It doesn't have a me So that one was deleted. So that worked. Right now the only way you can see all the messages that are all the user submitted messages is to delete one, it would be nice to be able to see the user submitted messages without having to delete one. So let's add some additional features. Let's go back over to the bot. So after adding the ability to get a list of user submitted messages, from right from discord, we're going to add the ability to turn off and on whether the bot responds to sad words. So you will be able to actually update that right from discord, whether it's going to be responding or not. So we're going to kind of do all that at once. First of all, we are going to create a new key value pair in the database. So right after the starter encouragements, we're going to check if responding is in the database yet. So this is gonna be a new key in the database responding. If it's not in the database, db keys, then we're going to add it. And it's going to default it's going to start off by being true respond, thing equals true. And we do need to put a colon right here. And now we only want to respond if this is true. So down here, where it responds to words. That's this whole section right here is when it's is when it's responding to the sad word. So I'm going to press tab here, because this is all going to be inside an if statement. If dB, we're going to get the value of the responding key in the database responding. So if that's true, then it will respond to the sad words. If not, it won't respond to the sad words. In a minute, we will add the ability to update this value. So let's go back before we add the ability to update that value, we're going to add the ability to list encouraging messages. So if message that starts with me, maybe like guess what the user command is gonna be used, it's gonna be a list. So if the user, the user types in list into discord, then first of all we're going to get we're going to make a empty list encouragements equals an empty list because there may not be any encouragements in the list yet. So we're going to check if encouragements is in dB keys with an S. Then encouragements, we're going to add them we're going to set the encouragements in the database to the incursions, variable DB encouragements and then we just have to return the encouragements. So Oh, wait that message or send the message to the channel. That send and encouragements. Okay, now, users should be able to get a list of the encouragements. Now we're going to have the feature of changing whether the bot is going to respond to sad words or not. So if message that starts with risk responding, quotation mark responding, then we're going to get the value. So the idea is that the user is going to put responding true or responding false, if the discord message that the bot is going to receive as a command. So if a nano value, we're gonna get the value that the user typed in, so is it true or false split we're going to do just like before responding. And again, we're going to put responding space because we don't want this space right after that. So we want the first element in that array, which is the second the second element of the array and index one. So we got the value. So now if value dot lower, no matter if they typed in lowercase or uppercase, we're going to convert it to lowercase. So if it equals True, then we're going to make sure that DB responding equals true. And then let me scroll down a little bit here. We're going to send the message message back to Discord. Oh, wait. Message dot channel dot send. Responding is on. Okay, we're gonna have an else, I'm just gonna copy this whole thing. So if valued at lower does not equal true. I'll just change this to else. We're actually making it so the person doesn't actually have to type in false anything but true will be assumed to be false. So encouraging, responding is going to be set to false. And it's going to say responding is off. The code for the bot is complete. This is all we're adding to the bot. We're not quite done, though. We're not quite done. We're going to test it. And then I'm going to tell you about one more very important step. So let's try this. Let's go to back to our bot. Oh, we have to run the bot again. Okay, the bot is running. Hey, bot. I am sad. Okay, it added that now let's get a list of our messages. Remember sent is stored in the database. There should still be messages. Yep. See, these are the messages messages we added before the last time we ran our bot. But since it stored in the database, they get stored dependent between times that you've run your your code. So let's add one. Oh, put add. Nice. I'm just nice. Oh, I did that wrong. It's actually supposed to be new. Make sure you type in the commands, right. And let's list them again. Show is nice. Now let's delete something delete index one that should be the middle one. And Yep, it shows them that we can even list them again. Now let's see if we can change turn off and on whether the body's responding. Let's confirm that the bot is responding. I'm sad. Nice, huh? Maybe it's saying nice because the data said it's hard to tell with this bot. But let's see if we can turn off the messages. So responding false. If I type in sad, and it doesn't say anything, if I type in depressed, it doesn't say anything. But if I do responding, true. Okay, let's do say I am depressed. Okay, the bot thinks that's pretty nice. Now, since we created the responding variable in the database, it will save weather between times even if you shut down your bot and rerun it, it will still save whether it's supposed to be responding or not. Okay, so technically, our bot is done, but you don't want to stop now. Because if I close my tab, the bot will just stop running. And then it's not gonna work. If I close my browser, the bots gonna stop running, it's not gonna work. There is a workaround repple it will continue running a web server even after the tab is closed. Now this is not a web server. But we can create one to run it at the same time as this. But even a web server will only run for up to an hour without any use. Oh, here's the rep docs about the web servers. See it says once deployed, the server will continue to run in the background even after you close the browser tab. The server will stay awake and active until an hour after its last request after which it will enter a sleeping stage. So even if you have a web server web server running, it will eventually stop running after an hour after its last request. So if nobody's using the disk or bottles have stopped working. However, there is a way to make the bot continually get requests so it never shuts down. So actually rip rebel has announced that in the future They will offer a paid plan that allows code run continuously, no matter what it will just never enter the sleeping sage. But they don't offer that quite yet. It's coming very soon, maybe it'll be available by the time you see this video. But until that is implemented, there is another way to keep your bot running longer than an hour. And this method even works with the free tier of replicas. So to keep this bot running continuously, we're going to use another free service called uptime robot, up and rollback can be set to ping the bots web server on replica every five minutes with constant pings, the bot will never enter the sleeping stage, and will just keep running. So we have two more things to do to make sure our bot is working as we want to make sure it's working running continuously. We're going to create a web server and repple it and set up uptime robot to continuously ping the web server. Okay, creating the web server is simpler than you may think. To do it, we're going to create a new file, so go to files and click the Add File button. And this is just going to be called keep alive.pi. Because the whole purpose of the web server is to keep keep everything alive. Okay, I'm just gonna paste in the code from the web server here. It's pretty simple. Like I said, and it's not, it's not really specifically important for the bot, it's just a thing that we do in replique, to make it keep going. So I will have a link to the text of this web server right in the description here. So you can just copy and paste it also. But you can see it's not that long. So in this code, we're going to import flask, and we're going to use flask as the web server. And it's going to return Hello, I'm alive to anyone who visits the server, the server will run on a separate thread from our bot, the server is going to run on a separate thread from robot, so they can both be running at the same time. But the rest of this is not really relevant to our bot, we just need the bot to run this web server. So let's go back into main.pi. And then at the top, we're going to have to import it. So from keep alive, import, keep alive. And if you just go back over here, that that it's importing this, which is this is what runs our web server here. So from it's going to import the web server, and then we're going to go all the way to the bottom. And right before the client runs, we're going to call keep alive. And this will run our web server. So if I stopped the bot and rerun the bot, it's something different is going to happen because of the bot because of the web server. Okay, you can see a new window open right up here. And this is our web server running and see how it says Hello, I'm alive. That's from our web server code where it says return Hello, I'm alive. So whenever you go to the server, it says Hello, I'm alive. Now the important thing here is this URL. So this URL was created. And this is the URL that we are going to ping from uptime robot. So I'm going to copy this URL right here. And then we're going to use it in the next section. So now we need to set up uptime robot. So the first step is to create a free account, and then get logged in. Okay, once you're logged into uptime robot, just click add new monitor for the monitor type, https and the friendly name, you can name this anything we're gonna just put, bought. And then for the URL, this is where you paste in the URL that you copied all over from repel repple it and the monitoring interval we'll just leave this the same as every five minutes. And then create, monitor and then create monitor again monitor created so I can close this. And we should be able to see it right here. Here it is. This is now going to ping our bot every five minutes. So at this point, it's going to be continuing, continuing continue to run even after we close our tab and even after an hour. Even if there's no activity in discord, this bot will just run continuously. Let's just try closing the tab really quick. I'm just gonna copy this URL, close a tab. Let's see if we can just open the tab back up on here and you can see it's still running still running in this right here. It could mean it is going to say something like this every time it's pinged. I don't know if that's from the ping or not, or if it's just from reloading. But we are now done. Now the bot will run continuously, so people can always interact with it on replicat. It's time for a bonus section, you already know how to set up a Python bot and run it continuously from repple it. Now I'm going to show you how to set up another discord bot to work with web hooks. We are going to connect the bot to GitHub so that the bot will post a message to your server whenever a certain GitHub repository is updated. And for this GitHub bot, you don't even need to code anything, or hosted anywhere. Let me show you how it works. Okay, to add this GitHub bot, we'll go to our server. And then we'll go to the server settings here. And then we'll click integrations. And then there's web hooks create web hook. And instead of calling it Captain Hook, I'm going to name it. I'll name it GitHub. Okay, and we'll put it in the general channel. And then I'll just copy the webhook URL. Okay, I'll make sure to save. Okay, now I'm gonna go over to the GitHub repo that I want to connect with this bot. So I'm going to use the free code camp.org GitHub repo. And then I'll go to Settings. And then on the side here, it says web hooks. Okay, now I'm going to click Add web hook. And then I'm just going to paste in the URL that I copied from Discord. Now here's an important part, you can't just use the URL, you also have to add something, I'm gonna add slash GitHub at the end of the URL. And then for the content type, I'll change it to application slash JSON, and they'll scroll down. And for what event should trigger the web hook, I'm gonna do send me everything. Depending on what you're trying to do, you may want to do just the push event or select individual events. But I'm gonna do everything. So I'll add the web hook. And now I can go back right over to my discord channel. If I wait, we should start to see some events happening on the from the Free Code Camp GitHub repo. Let me go and just try to make an event happen. I'll just unstarred star the repo. And it worked. We just got a message from the GitHub bot, new star added. So now we've connected our bot to GitHub through web hooks. And the GitHub bot will post a message whenever anything happens on the GitHub repo. You can create bots to work with a lot of other external services with web hooks. Okay, you've reached the end of this tutorial. Now you've prepared to go out and code your own discord bot.
