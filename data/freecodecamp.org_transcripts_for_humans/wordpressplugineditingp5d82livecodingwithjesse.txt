00:04 - hey everybody
00:05 - welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:07 - jesse
00:08 - and today we're going to do something
00:10 - weird we're going to code in php
00:14 - nothing wrong with php it's just weird
00:16 - because we usually don't code with php
00:19 - uh we roll with javascript around here
00:22 - but um
00:24 - i have to i don't really have another
00:26 - option
00:27 - so let me
00:28 - kind of break down what the problem is
00:30 - and how i think we're going to solve it
00:32 - and if any of you have
00:35 - better ideas please let me know i'm open
00:37 - to trying anything at this point
00:40 - because
00:43 - i need to get some data it's really
00:44 - important and our current setup won't
00:47 - allow for getting the data that
00:50 - uh that we need
00:52 - so
00:54 - here's here's what's happening i've made
00:56 - these custom fields so if you're not
00:58 - familiar with wordpress this might not
01:00 - make sense at first but then hopefully
01:02 - once we get into it it'll make a little
01:04 - bit more sense but
01:05 - uh on the the posts
01:08 - we made all these custom post types
01:10 - right and we have these posts well i've
01:12 - added in some custom fields right by
01:15 - default wordpress has certain fields
01:17 - like a title and content things like
01:19 - that
01:20 - well i needed more than that
01:22 - all right you'll see why when we look at
01:25 - a specific case
01:28 - but i can't access that data through
01:30 - graphql so we're using that wp graphql
01:34 - plugin and it doesn't give us data from
01:36 - those custom fields by default
01:39 - so to complicate a little bit more i've
01:42 - used a plug-in called advanced custom
01:44 - fields pro
01:46 - to get that data
01:48 - or i'm sorry to make those fields
01:52 - so what i need to do is figure out a way
01:56 - in php
01:57 - so most likely in we either add to the
02:00 - php plug-in that we've been using to
02:03 - make all the custom post types or we'll
02:05 - have have a new one i haven't really
02:07 - decided yet
02:09 - um
02:11 - we need to figure out some way to make
02:13 - those
02:15 - the data from those fields
02:17 - available
02:20 - in graphql
02:22 - through that wp graphql plugin
02:25 - so i have some ideas
02:26 - so i went to the git repository
02:31 - and
02:35 - there were some other people that were
02:36 - trying to do the same thing so i have
02:38 - some ideas based on what they posted of
02:40 - their solutions
02:42 - and hopefully from their solutions we'll
02:44 - be able to piece something together
02:46 - that'll work for our use case
02:49 - that's the plan
02:50 - if anybody has any skills with wordpress
02:52 - php
02:54 - um
02:55 - you know wordpress plugins
02:58 - uh then you're most welcome here and uh
03:02 - you know feel free to chime in
03:06 - uh at any point
03:08 - all right so i just got a message from
03:10 - one of my student workers and
03:14 - he does not have the level of access
03:16 - necessary to do what i just asked him to
03:20 - do in wordpress so
03:21 - let me give him access real quick
03:24 - and then we'll get started
03:32 - if you notice my head like kind of
03:34 - blowing i'm listening to like
03:37 - 90s
03:38 - rap music right now on spotify so i just
03:41 - finished uh the second season of luke
03:44 - cage on netflix and so now i'm of course
03:47 - like
03:48 - remembering all this old school rap
03:50 - music because it's all the the
03:52 - soundtrack for that show is
03:54 - all that kind of stuff
03:56 - so
03:59 - apologies to that
04:02 - anybody else a fan of luke cage or the
04:04 - any of the marvel series on netflix
04:09 - i'm i'm a big fan luke h is one of my
04:11 - favorites
04:14 - i'd probably say luke cage and daredevil
04:16 - were my favorites out of all the
04:18 - marvel series
04:21 - okay
04:23 - all right so i gave him access
04:25 - let's see
04:35 - all right so i just made the student
04:37 - worker in admin hopefully
04:40 - hopefully he doesn't mess anything up he
04:43 - seems to catch on pretty quickly though
04:45 - to everything so i think it'll be good
05:01 - all right so i just messaged them and
05:03 - said with great power comes great
05:04 - responsibility
05:08 - so see if anybody gets that reference
05:10 - let me know where it's from
05:13 - all right cool we're up to a decent
05:15 - viewer account now so i think now is a
05:16 - great time for me to get my face off the
05:18 - screen
05:20 - and switch over
05:22 - all right cool so let me check let me
05:24 - show you what's what's going on here
05:26 - so
05:27 - this is uh
05:30 - what is this graph
05:32 - graphical i think that's how we
05:33 - pronounce it graphical uh it's a chrome
05:36 - browser plugin that lets us
05:40 - search through
05:42 - our graphql data
05:44 - so i've just searched for menu so this
05:46 - is the custom post type that i made and
05:49 - that i'm using these custom fields with
05:52 - and you can see
05:54 - here's what's available
05:59 - these are all the fields that are
06:00 - available for me to get data from
06:02 - there's a lot of stuff there
06:04 - actually i'm probably blocking some of
06:05 - it it doesn't matter because the stuff
06:07 - we want is not it's not there
06:09 - right and if you have this this
06:11 - extension you can check out
06:14 - what we have in graphql as well if you'd
06:16 - like
06:19 - but yeah i can't get access to that so
06:22 - we need to change that
06:25 - so let me show you
06:27 - let me log in here and i'm going to show
06:29 - you
06:30 - what this post
06:31 - looks like
06:34 - and
06:36 - menu
06:38 - there we go menus
06:42 - let's see
06:43 - maybe this one all right cool so we have
06:45 - this would be
06:46 - a
06:48 - navigation menu
06:50 - that would kind of show up on the right
06:52 - hand side and just scroll with the user
06:55 - and this navigation menu
06:57 - would include these links and it would
06:59 - appear on all pages that have to do with
07:02 - franciscan
07:03 - press
07:05 - or franciscan university press i think
07:08 - we should just call it franciscan press
07:10 - though because otherwise it gets
07:11 - shortened to fu press
07:13 - and that's not really a good a good name
07:16 - right
07:17 - um
07:19 - let me get all right christopher's
07:21 - asking for the link i'll put that in the
07:25 - in the description yeah that's my fault
07:26 - i should have just put it in anyway
07:29 - uh oops
07:32 - all right the link
07:33 - to the graphql endpoint that i'm working
07:35 - with is now in the live chat
07:39 - so you can check that out if you want
07:41 - and i'm gonna throw in the link to the
07:44 - dead version of the website
07:46 - dev to franciscan dot university
07:52 - so you can check that out as well
07:56 - that should not take that long
07:59 - i thought i set it up to always keep at
08:01 - least one instance running
08:05 - i have to work on that if anybody uses
08:08 - now
08:09 - uh from zeit
08:11 - and you know why this could be taking so
08:14 - long let me know
08:16 - because i'm not it shouldn't take that
08:18 - long
08:19 - um
08:20 - okay
08:23 - so let's just go to a place that should
08:26 - have this menu so let's let's check out
08:29 - um
08:31 - franciscan
08:34 - the press thing let's see
08:36 - maybe franciscan magazine should have
08:41 - i don't even have that route set up yet
08:43 - okay
08:44 - um
08:45 - i still have to set that one up some of
08:47 - the stuff down lower on the menu i guess
08:49 - didn't get set up
08:52 - um
08:53 - households
08:59 - oh there we go
09:01 - that's kind of odd
09:03 - why isn't that working
09:11 - all right cool well good to see that i
09:13 - still have work to do anyway this
09:15 - households page i know should have a
09:17 - menu
09:18 - so
09:20 - we're gonna the menu would just be on
09:23 - this side right where i'm not kind of
09:24 - moving my mouse
09:25 - uh and it would just scroll down with
09:27 - the user so i just wanna just let you
09:29 - know where this menu would be and then
09:30 - on mobile i think the menu will drop to
09:32 - the bottom so we'll actually make two
09:34 - different menus and we'll just switch
09:35 - out visibility based on screen width and
09:38 - we can do that just with some some media
09:40 - queries with css
09:44 - all right
09:45 - and i forgot to set my pomodoro timer
09:47 - let me set that now
09:49 - so i'm going to code for 25 minutes and
09:52 - after that i'm going to go to the live
09:53 - chat and answer your questions so i see
09:55 - some some activity there in the chat
09:57 - so
10:00 - if
10:03 - if you've asked something i'm not
10:04 - ignoring you i'm just going to wait
10:06 - until after this 25 minute period is up
10:12 - all right
10:14 - so we probably won't even need to look
10:16 - at this page anymore we're mainly going
10:18 - to be dealing with this page and with
10:20 - our our php
10:22 - so let's scroll over
10:26 - there we go
10:27 - so here's our
10:29 - our current plugin the fastest way to
10:31 - get started i think would just be to use
10:34 - this same plugin that we've been using
10:36 - for all our custom post types this
10:38 - plugin is available on github
10:40 - if you check out that
10:43 - fus marcon repository that's the same
10:46 - place we have the repository for
10:49 - uh for this this react project you'll
10:52 - see this franciscan franciscan custom
10:54 - post types uh plug-in so you can check
10:57 - that out if you'd like
10:59 - it's open source feel free to change it
11:01 - edit it use it for whatever you need to
11:05 - um
11:06 - but i think we could we could probably
11:08 - just for now put some stuff down here
11:13 - and then
11:15 - probably put it in its own plug-in at
11:17 - some point because this plug-in is
11:18 - getting really really huge
11:24 - all right
11:53 - all right sorry about that my student
11:55 - workers keeps asking me things on slack
11:57 - so
11:58 - i want to respond
12:00 - um
12:02 - all right so next thing i'm going to do
12:03 - is pull over this
12:07 - these
12:11 - i guess examples that are here
12:13 - in this
12:15 - repo and i'm going to paste this in the
12:18 - description so
12:19 - these are attempts that other people
12:21 - have made
12:24 - to get this to work basically to solve
12:25 - the same problem that we're we're having
12:28 - and it seems like at least some of them
12:30 - were successful okay so this one
12:33 - was successful
12:35 - in particular for the repeater field
12:38 - which is the field that we're we're
12:39 - using
12:41 - so i'm i definitely want to try this one
12:43 - first there's a bit
12:46 - there's one that's that's
12:48 - shorter
12:49 - it doesn't quite require as many lines
12:51 - of code
12:52 - that we might be able to utilize later
12:54 - on when we have some more custom fields
12:56 - that aren't as complex as this
13:00 - but for now i really want to try to get
13:01 - this repeater field working because i
13:03 - know if i can get this working i can
13:05 - probably get anything working this is
13:07 - seems to be
13:11 - the most
13:12 - complex
13:14 - example that we could use
13:17 - all right so
13:18 - first things first let's just copy and
13:20 - paste this and start editing it and see
13:22 - if we can get
13:24 - a different response here
13:27 - and with php and wordpress plugins in
13:29 - particular you know pretty much right
13:32 - away if it doesn't work because usually
13:34 - everything crashes
13:36 - so
13:37 - that'll be
13:38 - it'll be obvious if we mess it up
13:41 - and then also
13:43 - if we don't see the right data here
13:46 - then
13:47 - we'll know right away
13:56 - okay
14:00 - all right that always seems like i'm
14:02 - looking away from the camera but my my
14:04 - other monitor is is over here so
14:08 - i don't i was going to move the webcam
14:10 - to show you but i
14:12 - i don't want to move it and then i give
14:13 - everybody motion sickness so i'm going
14:15 - to hold off on that
14:16 - but my other monitors here that's how i
14:18 - keep looking away
14:21 - all right so i'm going to read through
14:23 - this anybody that's better at php than i
14:26 - am which
14:27 - wouldn't be that hard to be better than
14:28 - me at php uh please
14:31 - correct me if i'm reading this wrong but
14:33 - i'm just gonna try to think through this
14:36 - so i can get some idea of what's going
14:38 - on before we jump in and start changing
14:40 - things
14:43 - okay
14:45 - so
14:46 - we're adding an action graphql exhibit
14:49 - fields and
14:50 - a lot of these functions are built into
14:52 - wordpress so
14:55 - we we just kind of have to assume like
14:57 - this is going to work this function does
14:59 - something
15:00 - if we really are confused we can look it
15:02 - up and probably will be able to find it
15:05 - in the wordpress documentation
15:08 - all right so we're going to add an
15:09 - action graph gives you fields function
15:12 - fields okay
15:16 - making an object okay so it looks like
15:18 - in this case
15:24 - session
15:26 - okay so session is the name of a field
15:30 - all right good so
15:31 - let's
15:34 - let's change session right now
15:38 - oh sessions type all right
15:40 - um
15:44 - sessions
15:48 - field
15:52 - yeah let's change every instance of
15:55 - session
15:57 - to link
15:58 - since that's what we're dealing with in
16:00 - this particular case so
16:03 - we'll just get get that uh
16:06 - change right away
16:08 - um
16:21 - why did i have
16:24 - for some reason it's putting two s's
16:26 - there but
16:27 - all right lynx thanks and then i need to
16:29 - capitalize it here
16:32 - and
16:37 - i can't remember if that was supposed to
16:38 - be capitalized or not let's let's
16:39 - capitalize
16:41 - okay
16:50 - oh john you caught that about too many
16:52 - s's there thank you
16:54 - um
16:56 - all right so now let's let's continue so
17:02 - we're creating this new object type
17:04 - we've given it a name of link a
17:06 - description
17:07 - um
17:08 - one link row and then your text domain
17:13 - i i mean this seems like an example
17:15 - example text that
17:18 - but i'm not sure what's supposed to go
17:19 - in there so i'm going to leave it like
17:21 - that for now and hopefully we'll be able
17:23 - to see this
17:24 - displayed somewhere later on and then
17:27 - we'll get an idea of what it should be
17:30 - all right so then we have fields so in
17:32 - this case the fields that are being
17:34 - defined for each row so i'm making a lot
17:37 - of assumptions here but i'm assuming
17:39 - that each one of these
17:44 - is is going to be one row of our of our
17:48 - repeater so each row in our repeater
17:51 - fields is
17:52 - is made up of two fields
17:54 - and in this case
17:56 - they have the uid in the name but in our
17:58 - case it's going to be
18:01 - link
18:02 - well let's say
18:05 - link
18:09 - url
18:11 - and let's call this
18:17 - link name i'm pretty sure that's what i
18:19 - named them
18:21 - and in both cases these are strings
18:28 - so we don't have to change that
18:37 - resolve a custom post type and make sure
18:39 - this is exposed to graphql
18:46 - white map space
18:48 - let me check that
18:50 - example here where did it go
18:55 - i don't know what that white map space
18:57 - is
19:01 - okay in this app i'm reading right here
19:03 - the context of this
19:05 - there we go white map space sessions
19:07 - have some string fields and a field for
19:09 - a map space
19:12 - the white map space custom post type
19:17 - okay
19:22 - in this app you have exhibits
19:25 - okay so the main custom post type is
19:28 - white exhibit custom post type which can
19:30 - have a list of sessions that's the
19:32 - repeater field so in our case
19:35 - white exhibit
19:37 - is menu
19:39 - now i'm not sure
19:42 - i have some fields
19:44 - sessions have some string fields and a
19:46 - field for a map space white map space
19:49 - custom post type so i don't know that we
19:52 - need that white
19:53 - white map space
19:54 - all right i think
19:56 - this would be a field
20:02 - maybe that is connecting us to another
20:05 - post type which we don't really need
20:07 - right now on that one but it's good to
20:08 - know that we can do that so let's get
20:10 - rid of map space
20:18 - okay
20:23 - all right so we've gotten rid of that
20:25 - just it's always nice to get rid of code
20:27 - especially when you don't really
20:28 - understand it anyway
20:30 - one less thing to worry about
20:33 - all right define the field containing
20:35 - your repeater
20:45 - links
20:47 - return a list because repeaters are
20:49 - lists
20:50 - okay
20:52 - type
20:53 - links type description
20:55 - yeah
21:06 - all right um
21:13 - all right this is graphql exhibit fields
21:17 - this is this needs to change right um
21:22 - unless this is just
21:24 - this name could be whatever we want
21:27 - i guess it doesn't matter but let's
21:29 - let's say menu
21:32 - menus fields
21:41 - let's say that
21:43 - the thing that i'm i'm
21:46 - i don't get is
21:51 - these values should in some way be
21:53 - connected to that menu's custom post
21:55 - type
21:58 - and i'm not seeing where that connection
21:59 - is
22:01 - so
22:04 - let me check this again
22:15 - all right i'm going to scroll up and see
22:18 - because there's a similar solution
22:21 - and i said each year on our project
22:23 - that'll return strange
22:34 - get filled
22:45 - using issues gives you so good first
22:48 - meadow did we use get field
23:14 - okay and you see some previous examples
23:16 - with the same problem
23:18 - which
23:19 - the these were
23:21 - i believe failed attempts
23:31 - well it looks like there's a gist here
23:33 - with another solution
23:36 - we'll take one look at this
23:38 - whoa
23:53 - okay so this section looks very similar
24:12 - but this section is definitely different
24:16 - hooray
24:25 - interesting
24:48 - um
25:05 - all right let me see
25:10 - it says to use this get field but i
25:13 - didn't see it in here so let's search
25:15 - for it
25:17 - there we go there it is
25:18 - get field links
25:20 - post
25:22 - okay you know what i'm just going to try
25:23 - this so i can't really see
25:27 - exactly how this is gonna all link up
25:29 - but
25:30 - i'm gonna try it
25:33 - maybe i'm just missing something and it
25:35 - it will work i hope that's the case all
25:37 - right so i just copied that
25:40 - and i'm going to paste it
25:43 - oops
25:46 - too many things open
25:48 - all right
25:49 - so we're going to go down
25:52 - to plugins
25:54 - this is the wordpress admin panel in
25:56 - case you know you're not familiar with
25:58 - that
25:59 - um
26:01 - so i'm gonna go down to plugins
26:04 - if i can find it there we go and then
26:06 - editor
26:07 - you can actually edit the code for
26:09 - plugins right here it is not recommended
26:12 - obviously
26:13 - right i would be way more hesitant to do
26:16 - this to a site that was live but we're
26:17 - still in development mode so
26:19 - the site has not launched yet and i'm
26:21 - okay with this
26:24 - you could definitely crash a live site
26:26 - when doing this
26:28 - and
26:29 - let's update and hopefully we don't get
26:32 - a white screen
26:34 - hey
26:36 - great
26:38 - i'm gonna refresh just to verify yeah no
26:41 - no weird right white screen that's
26:44 - awesome
26:45 - um now let's go back here and
26:48 - i'm just gonna run that
26:49 - and see
26:53 - i'm going to click on menu again and see
26:55 - if we can
27:08 - um
27:22 - all right i'm not getting it there but
27:24 - it potentially it might show up
27:27 - elsewhere
27:29 - so what did we call that
27:33 - link
27:35 - let's see if we can find it here
27:48 - um
28:06 - hmm
28:11 - i don't think that worked
28:14 - but we could try
28:17 - reloading everything
28:42 - hmm
28:50 - let me check my time
28:52 - all right so if you ask some questions
28:53 - in the chat just hang in there for about
28:55 - six more minutes and then i'll answer
28:56 - some questions
29:08 - all right this is alphabetical order so
29:15 - i'm just gonna scroll down
29:18 - nope nothing just link
29:21 - um
29:25 - yeah i'm not worried about that
29:39 - i mean i'm gonna i don't think link is
29:40 - the link we're looking for i'm gonna
29:42 - verify that now
29:43 - yeah that's definitely not the
29:45 - particular link that we are
29:49 - looking for that's the permalink
29:58 - all right let me check this out
30:16 - hmm
30:48 - hmm
30:50 - nope
30:51 - all right so i'm not seeing anything new
30:55 - uh in our
30:58 - our schema so
31:02 - first attempt didn't work
31:04 - not really surprised at that
31:11 - so
31:13 - let's see
31:22 - all right let's think about this
31:24 - uh description for graphql okay so all
31:26 - of this
31:30 - define your fields the description one
31:33 - link row
31:59 - define the field containing your
32:01 - repeater
32:06 - you know what we
32:08 - i'm wondering if this is case sensitive
32:11 - and that makes a difference
32:13 - right because we are
32:18 - i don't know if this would make a
32:19 - difference here then usually when we're
32:21 - talking about the description the name
32:23 - um can be what anything
32:31 - thank you equals give
32:34 - blanks
32:46 - you know what i should double check and
32:47 - see if i've
32:50 - what the slug for the repeater is that i
32:53 - actually uh used
32:58 - all right so let's go in here
33:05 - here's our plug in our custom fields
33:06 - plug-in
33:08 - so we're going to go check out
33:10 - every time you make a new field in this
33:12 - plug-in it's it's given a name but then
33:14 - it's also given a slug so the slug is
33:17 - the more
33:20 - useful thing uh when we're dealing with
33:22 - the code
33:25 - so let's check out links
33:28 - and
33:29 - this field name is links
33:32 - let's make sure that's how we did it yep
33:34 - so we did say links and not link
33:41 - so i think this is fine because
33:44 - are we talking about one link yeah
33:48 - um
33:48 - but here we have links
33:54 - okay
34:01 - hmm
34:06 - all right so that looks okay
34:15 - oliver says set graphql exhibit fields
34:18 - and not graphql menu fields
34:22 - okay oliver yeah so it was exhibit
34:25 - fields before but i thought exhibit i'll
34:28 - try it out
34:32 - um i'll try that out it just seemed like
34:36 - before that um exhibit was specific to
34:40 - the project like exhibit was that custom
34:43 - uh post type
34:44 - so
34:49 - i will try that out this would be the
34:51 - last thing i try before i answer some
34:52 - questions so
34:55 - go back here
34:56 - to this
34:58 - and
35:00 - i just pasted in the new stuff
35:06 - okay
35:08 - and now
35:11 - i'm gonna do a refresh just to make sure
35:14 - nothing's saved there
35:20 - all right
35:38 - nothing
35:47 - hmm
35:50 - okay
35:51 - all right couldn't get it to work yet
35:53 - let's take a five minute break answer
35:55 - some questions hopefully we can think of
35:57 - some other things to try uh for this
36:02 - i will say i assume that this problem
36:04 - was going to take me a while to figure
36:06 - out so like not something that i would
36:08 - get done during today's stream so
36:12 - as long as i'm making some progress
36:15 - which i think we've made some progress
36:16 - so far
36:17 - at least in figuring out what
36:20 - a little bit about what doesn't work
36:24 - so i think we'd be good progress is good
36:27 - okay
36:44 - all right looks like some of you said
36:46 - spider-man i was talking about uh marvel
36:49 - characters and i i mentioned earlier
36:51 - that i just finished watching season two
36:53 - of luke cage and i really liked it uh it
36:56 - looks like some of your spider-man fans
36:59 - i always liked spider-man uh when i was
37:02 - younger that was my favorite
37:05 - spider-man and wolverine were my
37:06 - favorite
37:08 - when i was younger
37:12 - i still like him
37:24 - all right looks like a lot of the stuff
37:25 - in the chat or discussion between some
37:27 - of the people in the chat so i'm
37:28 - skipping through some of it if i happen
37:30 - to miss your question
37:31 - uh because i got lost in the discussion
37:34 - just um ask me again down down below
37:46 - okay christopher thanks
37:48 - um that graphq uh graphical extension
37:51 - that i'm using on chrome is called uh
37:55 - chrome chromie ql c-h-r-o-m-e-i-q-l
38:00 - so that's supposed to be chromical i
38:02 - don't know what it's how you pronounce
38:03 - it but
38:04 - um
38:06 - let's see
38:12 - christopher said ooh php is gross
38:16 - well i guess everybody has their own
38:18 - preferences for the first language i
38:20 - will say this it seems like php does get
38:24 - hated on quite a bit these days
38:31 - christopher says no js all the way oh i
38:33 - mean i much prefer node but sometimes
38:35 - you got to do what you got to do
38:37 - um
38:38 - says i've never been a fan of wordpress
38:40 - either i prefer to implement the thing
38:41 - i'm trying to build either with a
38:43 - library or by writing my own version
38:44 - usually works better because i know how
38:46 - it works
38:47 - yeah for sure um
38:49 - in this case
38:51 - i i was not about to write a whole
38:53 - content management system uh on my own
38:56 - though
38:58 - just didn't have the time or the
38:59 - resources to do it
39:04 - and i mean wordpress is extremely stable
39:06 - and has a huge user base so there's no
39:09 - way i can replicate that
39:18 - clergson says apollo
39:20 - and graph
39:22 - graphic love react native
39:25 - i'm also a huge fan of react native i
39:27 - have a react native project going on on
39:28 - the side with balance.io
39:31 - so that that project is coming along
39:33 - really well i can't wait till we're done
39:34 - and i can actually tell you all like hey
39:36 - check it out in the app store
39:38 - um if any of you are at all interested
39:41 - in cryptocurrency i think that that's
39:43 - going to be a really cool app
39:44 - once we're finished with it
39:50 - all right automated sound kinetics says
39:53 - hi i'm new to this channel i'm 18 and
39:55 - i'm really interested in coding but i'm
39:57 - really confused about choosing a
39:58 - programming language to start with can
40:00 - anyone help me out
40:03 - yeah
40:05 - it definitely depends on what you want
40:06 - to do but if you have no idea what you
40:08 - want to do
40:09 - i recommend starting with javascript as
40:12 - your first programming language and
40:14 - here's here's why
40:18 - javascript knowing javascript will allow
40:20 - you to make
40:22 - the
40:23 - largest variety of things with
40:26 - javascript you can of course do websites
40:29 - web apps but you can also do
40:32 - native apps
40:33 - for both mobile and desktop using
40:36 - electron and react native
40:39 - you can even use javascript to do some
40:41 - machine learning
40:42 - um with like tensorflow.js or brain.js
40:46 - you can do
40:49 - ar vr
40:51 - xor whatever they're calling you know
40:53 - all the the augmented reality and
40:56 - different types of reality there's ways
40:58 - to do with javascript you can do
41:00 - internet of things stuff with javascript
41:02 - i think it's
41:04 - it's the javascript library like johnny
41:07 - five
41:08 - that lets you do
41:09 - like internet of things
41:11 - stuff i forget what exactly it's called
41:14 - but
41:15 - um
41:18 - there there's really to my knowledge no
41:20 - area of programming that you are totally
41:23 - locked out of in javascript but with
41:25 - other programming language you are a bit
41:27 - more limited
41:28 - right so
41:30 - not that it would be impossible to
41:32 - program a lot of other things in another
41:34 - language but it's it's definitely not as
41:36 - easy
41:38 - right javascript just runs in the
41:39 - browser
41:41 - so the barrier entry there is is just so
41:44 - low
41:46 - now if you know you want to go into a
41:48 - specific field
41:49 - like if you really wanted to do machine
41:51 - learning or data science i'd say go with
41:53 - python if you really really wanted to
41:55 - focus on
41:58 - mobile apps for either
42:00 - ios or android then maybe you want to
42:03 - specialize
42:04 - right so
42:06 - if there's a certain company you really
42:07 - want to work for and
42:09 - they specialize in one thing go with
42:12 - that although if you want to do anything
42:14 - that has to do with the internet with
42:16 - with websites
42:17 - you're gonna have to know some
42:18 - javascript at some point
42:20 - unless you i don't know completely back
42:23 - end and work in in some language some
42:26 - other language right but
42:28 - if you're all to touch the front end
42:31 - of any web app
42:33 - you're going to need to know some
42:34 - javascript
42:36 - so
42:37 - i'd say that's a good place to go in
42:39 - terms of
42:41 - giving you the best opportunity
42:43 - to explore and figure out what you like
42:47 - if you want to know what's like really
42:49 - easy to pick up
42:50 - honestly i think python's really easy
42:52 - because there's not a whole lot of weird
42:54 - syntax stuff going on with with
42:56 - different characters it's all based on
42:58 - indentation so python seems to be
43:01 - easy to pick up
43:03 - my eight-year-old is learning python
43:04 - right now so
43:06 - um i think it's way easier for him
43:10 - to use that because it's indentation
43:12 - based instead of trying to look for the
43:14 - weird characters and knowing when to
43:16 - press shift on the keyboard and
43:17 - everything so
43:20 - that's that's my opinion on that so
43:25 - i um i i don't pretend to be an expert
43:30 - but based on my experience and my
43:32 - knowledge of of the field right now
43:35 - that's what i would go with
43:39 - okay
43:41 - all right so i didn't get through all of
43:43 - the chat
43:44 - but i'm gonna restart this pomodoro
43:46 - timer and then hopefully get through the
43:48 - rest of the chat when we're done
43:50 - all right
43:54 - let's see
44:12 - all right so we left off
44:14 - with
44:18 - hmm
44:25 - we left off with a failure right we can
44:27 - need it to work and the last thing we
44:29 - tried was switching back to
44:31 - um exhibits instead of menus now the the
44:36 - thing that
44:40 - the thing that i thought was odd
44:45 - was that
44:46 - we made no reference
44:48 - to
44:49 - the post type
44:52 - where these fields were being stored
44:54 - uh or or that these were attached to
44:56 - right so that menu's post type is where
44:59 - we're
45:00 - we're entering the data
45:07 - so i'm wondering if let's go back to our
45:09 - examples here
45:13 - i'm i'm wondering if
45:16 - in this example here
45:22 - where basically this part
45:26 - matches up
45:28 - with this
45:33 - i'm wondering if all of this
45:37 - has to go with it as well
45:58 - let's see where
46:00 - i'm gonna copy and paste this just so i
46:02 - can use my editor shortcuts to to look
46:05 - through it and get some syntax
46:06 - highlighting on it um but maybe we'll
46:09 - find our answer down here so let's give
46:11 - it a lot of space so we know what's what
46:16 - there we go now it's so much easier just
46:18 - to to read this with the syntax
46:20 - highlighting
46:21 - all right so
46:24 - this is this repeater field
46:32 - so we're putting in a lot more info
46:34 - about the repeater field
46:42 - object type type okay
46:45 - and then when we get down here we see we
46:47 - have a different name here so this is in
46:50 - the stats fields graphql stats
46:54 - fields
46:56 - okay so we're we're naming this
47:02 - i i kind of think that this could change
47:05 - and it doesn't doesn't necessarily
47:07 - matter
47:09 - to get names that description all right
47:12 - so this this section like i eventually
47:15 - figured out is supposed to be like this
47:17 - singular
47:18 - um
47:20 - okay so what
47:22 - we've
47:22 - done
47:24 - what we've done when this section i
47:26 - think will work
47:28 - field stats
47:30 - type
47:32 - description
47:44 - all right and what is that compared to
47:54 - okay
47:59 - links
48:03 - fields
48:09 - all right so let's grab
48:11 - this
48:13 - right and
48:15 - actually i want to see where they where
48:17 - this goes we have this array here do we
48:20 - reference array anywhere down here
48:22 - though
48:32 - do we reference that particular array i
48:35 - don't think so
48:53 - okay
48:55 - um let's grab this
48:57 - and
49:00 - we'll add it up here modify it for what
49:03 - we need
49:05 - so instead of stats
49:09 - we're going to say
49:11 - links
49:25 - all right see links
49:26 - repeater field
49:28 - and here's this thing this key a field
49:32 - and then this
49:33 - i wonder
49:35 - i wonder if we'll need that and where we
49:37 - can get that from like if that value is
49:40 - assigned when we've created that
49:49 - let me you know i have a fan running in
49:51 - the background on low let me know if
49:53 - that noise is if you can hear that noise
49:55 - and if it's annoying um i'll try to
49:59 - turn that off if it's if it's getting
50:00 - too annoying for you all
50:06 - i'm going to double check my messages
50:08 - here make sure there's no work messages
50:15 - there's so many notifications
50:19 - all right i think i'm good
50:28 - okay
50:30 - that's
50:31 - that's the only thing that i'm worried
50:33 - about here is that key
50:36 - of like where are we getting that key
50:37 - from
50:43 - and then the subfields
50:48 - we definitely need to change
51:03 - hmm
51:12 - i'm wondering
51:29 - hmm
51:42 - i'm going to leave it as is what i'm
51:44 - wondering is
51:46 - would would this code actually register
51:51 - new custom fields
52:00 - but it's not it's not applying them
52:01 - anywhere
52:05 - all right let me get rid of this stuff
52:06 - down here though
52:10 - so i definitely don't want this in here
52:20 - and i'm gonna take one more look at this
52:23 - something at the bottom that i was
52:25 - interested in here
52:39 - okay
52:44 - all right so let's let's just throw this
52:46 - in here right now
52:48 - and see what happens i'm
52:51 - well i'm kind of surprised we didn't get
52:52 - an error already but
52:55 - we'll see maybe we'll get one here
53:00 - hey nikki's here hey how's it going
53:04 - yeah there we go the php code changes
53:06 - roll back because in airline 1703.
53:16 - an unexpected
53:20 - that's interesting
53:21 - right because we we got that you know we
53:23 - copied and pasted that right from here
53:25 - so
53:26 - okay
53:34 - well let's take that out i kind of
53:37 - think we'll get another error but
53:39 - yeah unexpected use
53:44 - all right so that code is not going to
53:46 - work
53:53 - all right well let's take some of this
53:54 - out then
54:13 - this
54:23 - all right
54:27 - let's update just get rid of those
54:29 - errors
54:31 - all right great
54:34 - um i don't want to
54:41 - back here
54:46 - let's go
54:50 - there's our menus
54:53 - i'm gonna go into the menus just to make
54:55 - sure we haven't messed anything up
54:58 - um
55:00 - this would be a good
55:02 - a good check to make sure that they're
55:05 - they're right please
55:08 - insurance
55:10 - whoa
55:11 - whoa whoa whoa
55:16 - all right that's definitely not the
55:17 - right url
55:24 - some the old site has some weird stuff
55:25 - like this so in this case i'm not gonna
55:28 - attempt to
55:29 - keep this url
55:34 - okay well it looks like it hasn't messed
55:36 - it up
55:50 - okay
55:54 - nikki
56:05 - all right
56:06 - can
56:07 - anybody hear me and see me at this point
56:12 - i think it's working now
56:15 - so um
56:16 - yeah so there's a huge thunderstorm
56:18 - right now
56:19 - and the power went out so i think i'm
56:21 - gonna end the stream i'm really sorry to
56:23 - end it so abruptly but i think i'm gonna
56:26 - end the stream because the odds of the
56:27 - power going back out are pretty good
56:30 - um so i don't i don't want to keep
56:32 - having um you know this this video once
56:35 - it's you know available again have these
56:37 - huge gaps in it
56:39 - uh so
56:40 - yeah so i'm just gonna end and this now
56:43 - try to keep working on it i'm maybe i'll
56:45 - switch to my laptop uh so that
56:48 - i don't have to deal with the power
56:49 - going out but um anyway thank you all
56:52 - for watching and for your help and
56:54 - advice during this i'm still gonna keep
56:56 - working on this so this is an important
56:59 - thing like this this really needs to get
57:01 - finished before we can launch
57:04 - um
57:06 - probably other than that i'm going to
57:07 - add some more custom post types and
57:09 - custom fields and have my you know my
57:12 - student workers fill that that data in
57:15 - and that'll basically be what i'm up to
57:18 - say thursday i'll try to get a stream in
57:21 - tomorrow it'll probably be from home

57:34 - questions and um
57:37 - uh yeah so
57:40 - until next time have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do something weird we're going to code in php nothing wrong with php it's just weird because we usually don't code with php uh we roll with javascript around here but um i have to i don't really have another option so let me kind of break down what the problem is and how i think we're going to solve it and if any of you have better ideas please let me know i'm open to trying anything at this point because i need to get some data it's really important and our current setup won't allow for getting the data that uh that we need so here's here's what's happening i've made these custom fields so if you're not familiar with wordpress this might not make sense at first but then hopefully once we get into it it'll make a little bit more sense but uh on the the posts we made all these custom post types right and we have these posts well i've added in some custom fields right by default wordpress has certain fields like a title and content things like that well i needed more than that all right you'll see why when we look at a specific case but i can't access that data through graphql so we're using that wp graphql plugin and it doesn't give us data from those custom fields by default so to complicate a little bit more i've used a plugin called advanced custom fields pro to get that data or i'm sorry to make those fields so what i need to do is figure out a way in php so most likely in we either add to the php plugin that we've been using to make all the custom post types or we'll have have a new one i haven't really decided yet um we need to figure out some way to make those the data from those fields available in graphql through that wp graphql plugin so i have some ideas so i went to the git repository and there were some other people that were trying to do the same thing so i have some ideas based on what they posted of their solutions and hopefully from their solutions we'll be able to piece something together that'll work for our use case that's the plan if anybody has any skills with wordpress php um you know wordpress plugins uh then you're most welcome here and uh you know feel free to chime in uh at any point all right so i just got a message from one of my student workers and he does not have the level of access necessary to do what i just asked him to do in wordpress so let me give him access real quick and then we'll get started if you notice my head like kind of blowing i'm listening to like 90s rap music right now on spotify so i just finished uh the second season of luke cage on netflix and so now i'm of course like remembering all this old school rap music because it's all the the soundtrack for that show is all that kind of stuff so apologies to that anybody else a fan of luke cage or the any of the marvel series on netflix i'm i'm a big fan luke h is one of my favorites i'd probably say luke cage and daredevil were my favorites out of all the marvel series okay all right so i gave him access let's see all right so i just made the student worker in admin hopefully hopefully he doesn't mess anything up he seems to catch on pretty quickly though to everything so i think it'll be good all right so i just messaged them and said with great power comes great responsibility so see if anybody gets that reference let me know where it's from all right cool we're up to a decent viewer account now so i think now is a great time for me to get my face off the screen and switch over all right cool so let me check let me show you what's what's going on here so this is uh what is this graph graphical i think that's how we pronounce it graphical uh it's a chrome browser plugin that lets us search through our graphql data so i've just searched for menu so this is the custom post type that i made and that i'm using these custom fields with and you can see here's what's available these are all the fields that are available for me to get data from there's a lot of stuff there actually i'm probably blocking some of it it doesn't matter because the stuff we want is not it's not there right and if you have this this extension you can check out what we have in graphql as well if you'd like but yeah i can't get access to that so we need to change that so let me show you let me log in here and i'm going to show you what this post looks like and menu there we go menus let's see maybe this one all right cool so we have this would be a navigation menu that would kind of show up on the right hand side and just scroll with the user and this navigation menu would include these links and it would appear on all pages that have to do with franciscan press or franciscan university press i think we should just call it franciscan press though because otherwise it gets shortened to fu press and that's not really a good a good name right um let me get all right christopher's asking for the link i'll put that in the in the description yeah that's my fault i should have just put it in anyway uh oops all right the link to the graphql endpoint that i'm working with is now in the live chat so you can check that out if you want and i'm gonna throw in the link to the dead version of the website dev to franciscan dot university so you can check that out as well that should not take that long i thought i set it up to always keep at least one instance running i have to work on that if anybody uses now uh from zeit and you know why this could be taking so long let me know because i'm not it shouldn't take that long um okay so let's just go to a place that should have this menu so let's let's check out um franciscan the press thing let's see maybe franciscan magazine should have i don't even have that route set up yet okay um i still have to set that one up some of the stuff down lower on the menu i guess didn't get set up um households oh there we go that's kind of odd why isn't that working all right cool well good to see that i still have work to do anyway this households page i know should have a menu so we're gonna the menu would just be on this side right where i'm not kind of moving my mouse uh and it would just scroll down with the user so i just wanna just let you know where this menu would be and then on mobile i think the menu will drop to the bottom so we'll actually make two different menus and we'll just switch out visibility based on screen width and we can do that just with some some media queries with css all right and i forgot to set my pomodoro timer let me set that now so i'm going to code for 25 minutes and after that i'm going to go to the live chat and answer your questions so i see some some activity there in the chat so if if you've asked something i'm not ignoring you i'm just going to wait until after this 25 minute period is up all right so we probably won't even need to look at this page anymore we're mainly going to be dealing with this page and with our our php so let's scroll over there we go so here's our our current plugin the fastest way to get started i think would just be to use this same plugin that we've been using for all our custom post types this plugin is available on github if you check out that fus marcon repository that's the same place we have the repository for uh for this this react project you'll see this franciscan franciscan custom post types uh plugin so you can check that out if you'd like it's open source feel free to change it edit it use it for whatever you need to um but i think we could we could probably just for now put some stuff down here and then probably put it in its own plugin at some point because this plugin is getting really really huge all right all right sorry about that my student workers keeps asking me things on slack so i want to respond um all right so next thing i'm going to do is pull over this these i guess examples that are here in this repo and i'm going to paste this in the description so these are attempts that other people have made to get this to work basically to solve the same problem that we're we're having and it seems like at least some of them were successful okay so this one was successful in particular for the repeater field which is the field that we're we're using so i'm i definitely want to try this one first there's a bit there's one that's that's shorter it doesn't quite require as many lines of code that we might be able to utilize later on when we have some more custom fields that aren't as complex as this but for now i really want to try to get this repeater field working because i know if i can get this working i can probably get anything working this is seems to be the most complex example that we could use all right so first things first let's just copy and paste this and start editing it and see if we can get a different response here and with php and wordpress plugins in particular you know pretty much right away if it doesn't work because usually everything crashes so that'll be it'll be obvious if we mess it up and then also if we don't see the right data here then we'll know right away okay all right that always seems like i'm looking away from the camera but my my other monitor is is over here so i don't i was going to move the webcam to show you but i i don't want to move it and then i give everybody motion sickness so i'm going to hold off on that but my other monitors here that's how i keep looking away all right so i'm going to read through this anybody that's better at php than i am which wouldn't be that hard to be better than me at php uh please correct me if i'm reading this wrong but i'm just gonna try to think through this so i can get some idea of what's going on before we jump in and start changing things okay so we're adding an action graphql exhibit fields and a lot of these functions are built into wordpress so we we just kind of have to assume like this is going to work this function does something if we really are confused we can look it up and probably will be able to find it in the wordpress documentation all right so we're going to add an action graph gives you fields function fields okay making an object okay so it looks like in this case session okay so session is the name of a field all right good so let's let's change session right now oh sessions type all right um sessions field yeah let's change every instance of session to link since that's what we're dealing with in this particular case so we'll just get get that uh change right away um why did i have for some reason it's putting two s's there but all right lynx thanks and then i need to capitalize it here and i can't remember if that was supposed to be capitalized or not let's let's capitalize okay oh john you caught that about too many s's there thank you um all right so now let's let's continue so we're creating this new object type we've given it a name of link a description um one link row and then your text domain i i mean this seems like an example example text that but i'm not sure what's supposed to go in there so i'm going to leave it like that for now and hopefully we'll be able to see this displayed somewhere later on and then we'll get an idea of what it should be all right so then we have fields so in this case the fields that are being defined for each row so i'm making a lot of assumptions here but i'm assuming that each one of these is is going to be one row of our of our repeater so each row in our repeater fields is is made up of two fields and in this case they have the uid in the name but in our case it's going to be link well let's say link url and let's call this link name i'm pretty sure that's what i named them and in both cases these are strings so we don't have to change that resolve a custom post type and make sure this is exposed to graphql white map space let me check that example here where did it go i don't know what that white map space is okay in this app i'm reading right here the context of this there we go white map space sessions have some string fields and a field for a map space the white map space custom post type okay in this app you have exhibits okay so the main custom post type is white exhibit custom post type which can have a list of sessions that's the repeater field so in our case white exhibit is menu now i'm not sure i have some fields sessions have some string fields and a field for a map space white map space custom post type so i don't know that we need that white white map space all right i think this would be a field maybe that is connecting us to another post type which we don't really need right now on that one but it's good to know that we can do that so let's get rid of map space okay all right so we've gotten rid of that just it's always nice to get rid of code especially when you don't really understand it anyway one less thing to worry about all right define the field containing your repeater links return a list because repeaters are lists okay type links type description yeah all right um all right this is graphql exhibit fields this is this needs to change right um unless this is just this name could be whatever we want i guess it doesn't matter but let's let's say menu menus fields let's say that the thing that i'm i'm i don't get is these values should in some way be connected to that menu's custom post type and i'm not seeing where that connection is so let me check this again all right i'm going to scroll up and see because there's a similar solution and i said each year on our project that'll return strange get filled using issues gives you so good first meadow did we use get field okay and you see some previous examples with the same problem which the these were i believe failed attempts well it looks like there's a gist here with another solution we'll take one look at this whoa okay so this section looks very similar but this section is definitely different hooray interesting um all right let me see it says to use this get field but i didn't see it in here so let's search for it there we go there it is get field links post okay you know what i'm just going to try this so i can't really see exactly how this is gonna all link up but i'm gonna try it maybe i'm just missing something and it it will work i hope that's the case all right so i just copied that and i'm going to paste it oops too many things open all right so we're going to go down to plugins this is the wordpress admin panel in case you know you're not familiar with that um so i'm gonna go down to plugins if i can find it there we go and then editor you can actually edit the code for plugins right here it is not recommended obviously right i would be way more hesitant to do this to a site that was live but we're still in development mode so the site has not launched yet and i'm okay with this you could definitely crash a live site when doing this and let's update and hopefully we don't get a white screen hey great i'm gonna refresh just to verify yeah no no weird right white screen that's awesome um now let's go back here and i'm just gonna run that and see i'm going to click on menu again and see if we can um all right i'm not getting it there but it potentially it might show up elsewhere so what did we call that link let's see if we can find it here um hmm i don't think that worked but we could try reloading everything hmm let me check my time all right so if you ask some questions in the chat just hang in there for about six more minutes and then i'll answer some questions all right this is alphabetical order so i'm just gonna scroll down nope nothing just link um yeah i'm not worried about that i mean i'm gonna i don't think link is the link we're looking for i'm gonna verify that now yeah that's definitely not the particular link that we are looking for that's the permalink all right let me check this out hmm hmm nope all right so i'm not seeing anything new uh in our our schema so first attempt didn't work not really surprised at that so let's see all right let's think about this uh description for graphql okay so all of this define your fields the description one link row define the field containing your repeater you know what we i'm wondering if this is case sensitive and that makes a difference right because we are i don't know if this would make a difference here then usually when we're talking about the description the name um can be what anything thank you equals give blanks you know what i should double check and see if i've what the slug for the repeater is that i actually uh used all right so let's go in here here's our plug in our custom fields plugin so we're going to go check out every time you make a new field in this plugin it's it's given a name but then it's also given a slug so the slug is the more useful thing uh when we're dealing with the code so let's check out links and this field name is links let's make sure that's how we did it yep so we did say links and not link so i think this is fine because are we talking about one link yeah um but here we have links okay hmm all right so that looks okay oliver says set graphql exhibit fields and not graphql menu fields okay oliver yeah so it was exhibit fields before but i thought exhibit i'll try it out um i'll try that out it just seemed like before that um exhibit was specific to the project like exhibit was that custom uh post type so i will try that out this would be the last thing i try before i answer some questions so go back here to this and i just pasted in the new stuff okay and now i'm gonna do a refresh just to make sure nothing's saved there all right nothing hmm okay all right couldn't get it to work yet let's take a five minute break answer some questions hopefully we can think of some other things to try uh for this i will say i assume that this problem was going to take me a while to figure out so like not something that i would get done during today's stream so as long as i'm making some progress which i think we've made some progress so far at least in figuring out what a little bit about what doesn't work so i think we'd be good progress is good okay all right looks like some of you said spiderman i was talking about uh marvel characters and i i mentioned earlier that i just finished watching season two of luke cage and i really liked it uh it looks like some of your spiderman fans i always liked spiderman uh when i was younger that was my favorite spiderman and wolverine were my favorite when i was younger i still like him all right looks like a lot of the stuff in the chat or discussion between some of the people in the chat so i'm skipping through some of it if i happen to miss your question uh because i got lost in the discussion just um ask me again down down below okay christopher thanks um that graphq uh graphical extension that i'm using on chrome is called uh chrome chromie ql chromeiql so that's supposed to be chromical i don't know what it's how you pronounce it but um let's see christopher said ooh php is gross well i guess everybody has their own preferences for the first language i will say this it seems like php does get hated on quite a bit these days christopher says no js all the way oh i mean i much prefer node but sometimes you got to do what you got to do um says i've never been a fan of wordpress either i prefer to implement the thing i'm trying to build either with a library or by writing my own version usually works better because i know how it works yeah for sure um in this case i i was not about to write a whole content management system uh on my own though just didn't have the time or the resources to do it and i mean wordpress is extremely stable and has a huge user base so there's no way i can replicate that clergson says apollo and graph graphic love react native i'm also a huge fan of react native i have a react native project going on on the side with balance.io so that that project is coming along really well i can't wait till we're done and i can actually tell you all like hey check it out in the app store um if any of you are at all interested in cryptocurrency i think that that's going to be a really cool app once we're finished with it all right automated sound kinetics says hi i'm new to this channel i'm 18 and i'm really interested in coding but i'm really confused about choosing a programming language to start with can anyone help me out yeah it definitely depends on what you want to do but if you have no idea what you want to do i recommend starting with javascript as your first programming language and here's here's why javascript knowing javascript will allow you to make the largest variety of things with javascript you can of course do websites web apps but you can also do native apps for both mobile and desktop using electron and react native you can even use javascript to do some machine learning um with like tensorflow.js or brain.js you can do ar vr xor whatever they're calling you know all the the augmented reality and different types of reality there's ways to do with javascript you can do internet of things stuff with javascript i think it's it's the javascript library like johnny five that lets you do like internet of things stuff i forget what exactly it's called but um there there's really to my knowledge no area of programming that you are totally locked out of in javascript but with other programming language you are a bit more limited right so not that it would be impossible to program a lot of other things in another language but it's it's definitely not as easy right javascript just runs in the browser so the barrier entry there is is just so low now if you know you want to go into a specific field like if you really wanted to do machine learning or data science i'd say go with python if you really really wanted to focus on mobile apps for either ios or android then maybe you want to specialize right so if there's a certain company you really want to work for and they specialize in one thing go with that although if you want to do anything that has to do with the internet with with websites you're gonna have to know some javascript at some point unless you i don't know completely back end and work in in some language some other language right but if you're all to touch the front end of any web app you're going to need to know some javascript so i'd say that's a good place to go in terms of giving you the best opportunity to explore and figure out what you like if you want to know what's like really easy to pick up honestly i think python's really easy because there's not a whole lot of weird syntax stuff going on with with different characters it's all based on indentation so python seems to be easy to pick up my eightyearold is learning python right now so um i think it's way easier for him to use that because it's indentation based instead of trying to look for the weird characters and knowing when to press shift on the keyboard and everything so that's that's my opinion on that so i um i i don't pretend to be an expert but based on my experience and my knowledge of of the field right now that's what i would go with okay all right so i didn't get through all of the chat but i'm gonna restart this pomodoro timer and then hopefully get through the rest of the chat when we're done all right let's see all right so we left off with hmm we left off with a failure right we can need it to work and the last thing we tried was switching back to um exhibits instead of menus now the the thing that the thing that i thought was odd was that we made no reference to the post type where these fields were being stored uh or or that these were attached to right so that menu's post type is where we're we're entering the data so i'm wondering if let's go back to our examples here i'm i'm wondering if in this example here where basically this part matches up with this i'm wondering if all of this has to go with it as well let's see where i'm gonna copy and paste this just so i can use my editor shortcuts to to look through it and get some syntax highlighting on it um but maybe we'll find our answer down here so let's give it a lot of space so we know what's what there we go now it's so much easier just to to read this with the syntax highlighting all right so this is this repeater field so we're putting in a lot more info about the repeater field object type type okay and then when we get down here we see we have a different name here so this is in the stats fields graphql stats fields okay so we're we're naming this i i kind of think that this could change and it doesn't doesn't necessarily matter to get names that description all right so this this section like i eventually figured out is supposed to be like this singular um okay so what we've done what we've done when this section i think will work field stats type description all right and what is that compared to okay links fields all right so let's grab this right and actually i want to see where they where this goes we have this array here do we reference array anywhere down here though do we reference that particular array i don't think so okay um let's grab this and we'll add it up here modify it for what we need so instead of stats we're going to say links all right see links repeater field and here's this thing this key a field and then this i wonder i wonder if we'll need that and where we can get that from like if that value is assigned when we've created that let me you know i have a fan running in the background on low let me know if that noise is if you can hear that noise and if it's annoying um i'll try to turn that off if it's if it's getting too annoying for you all i'm going to double check my messages here make sure there's no work messages there's so many notifications all right i think i'm good okay that's that's the only thing that i'm worried about here is that key of like where are we getting that key from and then the subfields we definitely need to change hmm i'm wondering hmm i'm going to leave it as is what i'm wondering is would would this code actually register new custom fields but it's not it's not applying them anywhere all right let me get rid of this stuff down here though so i definitely don't want this in here and i'm gonna take one more look at this something at the bottom that i was interested in here okay all right so let's let's just throw this in here right now and see what happens i'm well i'm kind of surprised we didn't get an error already but we'll see maybe we'll get one here hey nikki's here hey how's it going yeah there we go the php code changes roll back because in airline 1703. an unexpected that's interesting right because we we got that you know we copied and pasted that right from here so okay well let's take that out i kind of think we'll get another error but yeah unexpected use all right so that code is not going to work all right well let's take some of this out then this all right let's update just get rid of those errors all right great um i don't want to back here let's go there's our menus i'm gonna go into the menus just to make sure we haven't messed anything up um this would be a good a good check to make sure that they're they're right please insurance whoa whoa whoa whoa all right that's definitely not the right url some the old site has some weird stuff like this so in this case i'm not gonna attempt to keep this url okay well it looks like it hasn't messed it up okay nikki all right can anybody hear me and see me at this point i think it's working now so um yeah so there's a huge thunderstorm right now and the power went out so i think i'm gonna end the stream i'm really sorry to end it so abruptly but i think i'm gonna end the stream because the odds of the power going back out are pretty good um so i don't i don't want to keep having um you know this this video once it's you know available again have these huge gaps in it uh so yeah so i'm just gonna end and this now try to keep working on it i'm maybe i'll switch to my laptop uh so that i don't have to deal with the power going out but um anyway thank you all for watching and for your help and advice during this i'm still gonna keep working on this so this is an important thing like this this really needs to get finished before we can launch um probably other than that i'm going to add some more custom post types and custom fields and have my you know my student workers fill that that data in and that'll basically be what i'm up to say thursday i'll try to get a stream in tomorrow it'll probably be from home so i will try that if not i'll be back next week and um as always i'm available on all different social media things you can ask me questions and um uh yeah so until next time have a wonderful day
