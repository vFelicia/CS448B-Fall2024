00:00 - hey this is angrew brown over here at
00:02 - exam Pro bringing you another complete
00:05 - study course and this time it's the
00:08 - GitHub foundations certification this
00:11 - one's all about GitHub and practicing
00:13 - some of your git skills and this is a
00:16 - great certification if you're looking to
00:17 - show your developer skills in the cloud
00:20 - or Tech the way we're going to help you
00:22 - get the certification as always is the
00:25 - lecture content doing Hands-On labs and
00:27 - giving you that free practice exam so
00:29 - you can go as that exam get that
00:31 - certification and put it on your resume
00:34 - I want to point out if you love these
00:35 - kinds of courses the best way to support
00:38 - more free study courses is to buy the
00:40 - paid additional materials that is
00:42 - optional but you'll get uh things like
00:44 - cheat sheets U more pratice exams and
00:47 - other things like that so I just want to
00:49 - tell you that I've taught a lot of
00:51 - different kinds of certifications in
00:53 - cloud and in Tech you name it I've
00:55 - taught it we got adab us Azure gcp
00:57 - terraform kubernetes and more more and
01:00 - obviously now GitHub and if you're
01:02 - wondering why I'm in a snowsuit it's
01:03 - because my office it's really cold it's
01:05 - like7 so this is how it has to be but I
01:08 - will see you in class in two seconds
01:14 - [Music]
01:16 - ciao hey this is angrew Brown from exam
01:19 - Pro and we're at the start of our
01:20 - journey asking the most important
01:22 - question first which is what is the
01:24 - GitHub Foundation certification well it
01:27 - is an entrylevel GitHub certification
01:29 - teaching you Git Version Control Basics
01:32 - working with GitHub repos collaboration
01:35 - features modern development project
01:38 - management uh GitHub privacy Security
01:41 - Administration GitHub community and open
01:43 - source now I put in Git Version Control
01:45 - Basics but uh they don't really required
01:48 - in the uh certification itself but you
01:50 - will implicitly learn them as you work
01:52 - through uh this course The Unofficial
01:55 - course code uh for the certification is
01:57 - ghf because there are no course codes uh
02:00 - that GitHub has published so I've used
02:02 - the um small initial initializations
02:04 - that they use on their um certification
02:07 - page GitHub is the leading uh Version
02:10 - Control service in the world it's one of
02:13 - the most common ways for developers to
02:14 - Showcase their code uh if you go for
02:17 - developer interviews a lot of times
02:18 - people want to have your GitHub link so
02:19 - they can see your activity um and your
02:22 - code so who's the certification for well
02:25 - consider this certification if you are
02:27 - new to Cloud programming and need to
02:29 - learn Version Control fundamentals um
02:31 - more like Version Control workflows
02:34 - online I I would be better to say uh
02:37 - you're a non-developer uh at Tech role
02:40 - so you are in Tech but you're just a
02:41 - non-developer looking to quickly add
02:43 - developer skills uh you want to be
02:46 - effective uh collaborating on code bases
02:48 - with other developers this GitHub
02:50 - certification will not test your git
02:52 - skills it's focused on GitHub you will
02:54 - use git but you may have serious gaps in
02:57 - git knowledge um to be used in a uh work
03:00 - or production environment so make sure
03:02 - you polyfill that information where you
03:04 - can um in terms of the road map they
03:06 - have four certifications the foundation
03:08 - the advanced security the actions the
03:10 - admin and this is where I would put them
03:12 - in terms of difficulty they don't um
03:14 - categorize them into levels but uh you
03:17 - level 100 I would say the foundations is
03:19 - is very easy um the advanced security I
03:21 - put it at 150 because it looks like an
03:23 - extension of the foundations focusing on
03:25 - the security features actions is very
03:27 - technical so a level 200 makes sense an
03:30 - admin is I wouldn't say hard but it goes
03:32 - into Enterprise so it's harder to get
03:34 - access to the Enterprise account and
03:36 - test it out and you have to understand
03:38 - Enterprise Concepts so I put it the
03:40 - level
03:41 - 300 uh there's a lot of different routes
03:43 - you could take you could go from the
03:44 - level 100 uh or sorry the get
03:47 - foundations to Advance Security to the
03:48 - admin or the foundations to the actions
03:51 - to me the advanced security seems like
03:52 - such little effort to do that it seems
03:55 - like a good follow-up or something you
03:56 - should do at the same time uh if the
03:58 - content's available to to um study when
04:01 - doing GI GitHub foundations uh if you're
04:04 - looking for particular roles you could
04:05 - probably say the cloud security engineer
04:07 - is where you'd go for the advanced
04:08 - security so You' start with the
04:09 - foundations for all of them go there if
04:11 - you want to be a cloud developer GitHub
04:13 - actions is super useful because it's a
04:15 - cicd pipeline and it's becoming one of
04:17 - the most popular cicd pipelines out
04:19 - there if you're an Enterprise engineer
04:21 - then the administrator is good for
04:23 - having that Enterprise knowledge if
04:24 - somebody wants to run GitHub uh there
04:27 - but you know these are just titles
04:28 - you're not going to actually have that
04:29 - role from completing these
04:30 - certifications it's just part of uh
04:33 - content for those particular roles um
04:35 - get up certifications do not validate
04:37 - programming technical diagramming code
04:39 - management other technical skills that
04:40 - are required for obtaining technical
04:42 - roles so just understand the limitations
04:44 - of these certifications they are useful
04:46 - for learning but understand that uh it
04:48 - it stops at a certain place okay how
04:51 - long should you take to pass if if
04:52 - you're a beginner uh and you've never
04:55 - used GitHub before and you've never used
04:56 - git or written code before and you're
04:58 - new to to Cloud in Tech maybe 20 hours
05:01 - um there is no uh historical information
05:03 - about this certification because it's
05:05 - brand new and I'm the first one with a
05:07 - study course out so we'll say 20 hours
05:09 - is a sufficient amount of time uh for
05:12 - experienced folks um if you have
05:14 - practical knowledge working with GitHub
05:16 - if you have technical knowledge working
05:17 - with Git uh you have strong background
05:19 - in technology worked in a technical
05:21 - developer role it's going to be 4 hours
05:23 - if you're an if you're in a technical
05:25 - role but just not a developer you might
05:27 - be more in the middle um and so I would
05:30 - probably say 14 hours of average study
05:32 - time 50% lecture 50% Labs uh or sorry
05:36 - 50% lecture in labs and then 50%
05:37 - practice exams that's usually always the
05:39 - same thing I always say and one to two
05:41 - hours a day for 14 days if it's 14 hours
05:43 - you can do an hour a day and you'll be
05:45 - in really really good shape what does it
05:47 - take to pass the exam watch the video
05:49 - lecture and memorize key information
05:51 - this exam in particular is very fact
05:53 - toal and unfairly so so make sure where
05:56 - I call out fact toal information to
05:58 - memorize it because it is silly and
06:00 - you'll lose points for that do the
06:02 - Hands-On Labs it's going to really help
06:04 - cement how all this stuff works together
06:06 - and even though the exams don't really
06:08 - require it I I want you to have that
06:10 - knowledge and I want you to have an
06:12 - easier time passing so please do the
06:14 - follow follow alongs do paid online
06:17 - practice exams because this one in
06:18 - particular again it's very fact toal and
06:21 - you need to see some variations so you
06:23 - don't get caught off guard if you think
06:24 - that you go through my course and go I'm
06:26 - really good at GitHub now uh you'll be
06:28 - thrown a bunch of Enterprise questions
06:30 - and stuff that you didn't think that
06:32 - would be there and in particular what
06:34 - information's there so make sure you
06:37 - utilize practice exams make sure you
06:39 - utilize my free practice exam which will
06:41 - come out with this um and you'll do fine
06:45 - again not a hard exam but you know I
06:46 - don't want you to be frustrated on that
06:47 - exam losing out some particular points
06:50 - because you didn't know that you had to
06:52 - know the uh uh the lineup of GitHub work
06:56 - uh workflow actions inside of uh GitHub
06:59 - projects or something like that there
07:00 - are seven domains for this certification
07:03 - and I need to point out that for some
07:04 - reason GitHub uh does not share the
07:07 - waiting of each domain most exams do
07:09 - that and my experience when I sat the
07:11 - exam it was kind of imbalance where I
07:13 - had a lot of Enterprise questions so
07:15 - just understand that you might not even
07:17 - see a question in the domain that you
07:19 - are expecting or you might have very few
07:21 - a lot in other areas I don't know why
07:24 - they did this it was a bad choice but
07:26 - that's what they did we have seven
07:27 - domains we have support uh GitHub
07:29 - Enterprise for users and key
07:31 - stakeholders uh domain two manage user
07:33 - identities and GitHub authentication uh
07:35 - domain three describe how GitHub is
07:37 - deployed distributed and licens domain
07:39 - four manage access and permissions based
07:41 - on membership domain five ensure or
07:44 - sorry enable secure software development
07:45 - and ensur compliance domain six manage
07:48 - GitHub actions domain seven benefit of
07:51 - benefits of the GitHub Community there's
07:53 - no development stuff in here but I've
07:55 - crammed in the exam development stuff
07:58 - because you really should know
07:59 - development stuff and GitHub is a
08:01 - developer platform for some reason they
08:03 - decided not to include it in here but I
08:06 - feel that it really makes it easier to
08:08 - utilize GitHub if you know the developer
08:10 - tools uh where do you take this exam at
08:12 - an in-person test center or online from
08:14 - the convenience of your own home GitHub
08:16 - delivers it with PSI um so PSI has an
08:20 - online version and then they have a a
08:22 - bunch of test networks that they
08:23 - partnered with um it is a it it is a
08:26 - proctored exam so there's somebody
08:27 - that's supposedly watching your exam so
08:30 - that you do not cheat I just want to
08:32 - warn you PSI is not known for having a
08:34 - good test experience when I saw at my
08:36 - exam um uh I was 30 minutes early
08:40 - checked
08:41 - in and uh I waited 40 minutes after my
08:45 - check-in time because it said it was
08:46 - connecting me to a special specialist it
08:48 - never did I had to contact support they
08:51 - uh they made me uh fill in a bunch of
08:53 - information which seemed weird because
08:55 - they should know who I am already cuz
08:56 - I'm in their app and then they told me
08:59 - oh I'm not actually connected to anybody
09:00 - and so the app lies to you so don't get
09:02 - stressed out if you have technical
09:04 - issues with PSI it's extremely common
09:07 - and uh if you're doing it online if you
09:09 - can do a test center I strongly
09:11 - recommend doing so because it just makes
09:13 - the whole experience a lot less
09:14 - stressful from the environment
09:16 - perspective from uh the technology
09:18 - perspective but if you got to do online
09:20 - just uh don't stress out and understand
09:23 - that everybody has these issues uh
09:25 - doesn't make sense but everyone has
09:27 - these issues and not to not to to sweat
09:29 - it or throw you off before your exam
09:31 - starts in terms of grading they don't
09:33 - give us a grade GitHub does not provide
09:35 - a passing score we don't know how many
09:37 - points there are we do know how many
09:39 - questions there are but uh for some
09:41 - reason they've decided not to provide
09:42 - that information uh they say in their
09:44 - FAQ because they can't exactly calculate
09:48 - it they don't want to give you an
09:49 - inaccurate number it really makes no
09:51 - sense but I'm going to tell you that you
09:53 - still will pass pass this exam it's not
09:56 - that hard but yeah you just have to make
09:58 - sure that you can get get as many points
09:59 - on those fact total questions and don't
10:01 - stress out about not knowing what your
10:03 - passing score is there are 75 questions
10:05 - in this exam 60 scored 15 unscored so
10:08 - you can afford to get 15 questions wrong
10:10 - at least there is no penalty for wrong
10:12 - questions at least as far as I'm aware
10:14 - of and I saw U both multiple choice and
10:17 - multiple answer uh sometimes it was
10:19 - choose two choose three it was never
10:21 - more than three there wasn't that many
10:22 - multiple answer uh like basically
10:25 - multiple select ones so it wasn't that
10:26 - bad don't stress out about the unscored
10:29 - questions because there's 15 of them
10:31 - they don't count towards your exam why
10:33 - is there unscored questions uh they're
10:35 - used to evaluate the introduction of new
10:37 - questions to determine if the exam is
10:39 - too easy and the passing score or
10:41 - question difficulty needs to be
10:42 - increased to discover users who are
10:44 - attempting to cheat the exam or still
10:45 - dump exam questions if you encounter
10:47 - questions you've never studied for that
10:49 - seem really hard keep your cool and
10:51 - remember they may be unscored questions
10:54 - the duration of this exam is 2 hours so
10:56 - you get 1.6 minutes per question so that
10:59 - exam time in minutes is 120 Minutes your
11:01 - C time is uh 30 minutes or sorry 150
11:05 - minutes because you add 30 minutes there
11:07 - when I say see time that's the time you
11:08 - need to go in and check in and re review
11:11 - the instructions and get your workspace
11:13 - set up and sign the NDA and show them
11:15 - your space um provide feedback at exam
11:19 - uh I was able to check in 30 minutes
11:20 - online
11:21 - prior you you probably want to be 45
11:24 - minutes prior to your exam okay so give
11:26 - yourself a few minutes to get set up and
11:28 - try to check in early sometimes they let
11:30 - you start exams early right so even if
11:32 - you're scheduled for 5 uh sometimes 5
11:35 - minutes after your check-in you can
11:36 - start and get rolling on it but uh yeah
11:39 - there you go and we'll see you in the
11:40 - next one
11:41 - [Music]
11:45 - ciao hey everyone it's Andrew Brown in
11:47 - this uh video I want to show you uh
11:50 - where you can get uh the exam guide and
11:53 - other additional information so you can
11:54 - understand where I'm getting this stuff
11:56 - and make sense of it yourself and you
11:58 - might hear my space space heater here I
11:59 - have the tiny space heater to keep my
12:01 - feet warm my hands warm so sorry if the
12:03 - background noise picks up but let's go
12:05 - take a look so the way you can get to
12:07 - this is you just type in
12:08 - G.I certifications love the short link
12:11 - by the way and I mean they have stuff
12:13 - down here below but what you really got
12:15 - to do is go to register and then connect
12:18 - your account and it'll do something with
12:19 - GitHub and then you'll see this stuff
12:21 - here okay now I want to point out that
12:24 - um they have an FAQ down
12:26 - below uh I guess they have a candidate
12:29 - handbook which is something I don't even
12:30 - sure if I open that
12:33 - [Music]
12:34 - up this is more about like how to run
12:38 - stuff
12:41 - yeah okay not really useful but um what
12:46 - we're looking for is the exam guides
12:49 - okay so if we were to go into the
12:52 - foundations which is this is the
12:53 - certification we're focused on you can
12:55 - see the price here it says you pass with
12:58 - the exam of 82% hooray I actually can
13:01 - see my score now I didn't know where
13:03 - that was you can't see
13:05 - it I'm trying to move my head here not
13:08 - sure why uh it's not letting me do that
13:11 - there we go and so I actually got an 82%
13:13 - which is pretty good considering I
13:15 - thought I flubbed a bunch of questions
13:16 - but that's pretty good remember there is
13:19 - no study course or practice exams before
13:21 - I took this um so that's great but they
13:24 - really should tell us the the non-p
13:27 - passing score so if we go down H to
13:30 - FAQ
13:32 - okay and we look up passing
13:34 - score since there are multiple versions
13:37 - of the certification exam the passing
13:38 - score can have minor variances depending
13:41 - on which version you take to ensure the
13:43 - Integrity of exams to avoid confusion on
13:45 - why there is a small variance will not
13:47 - provide you a specific total score and I
13:50 - mean I think that's kind of a failure of
13:52 - uh any kind of certification program I
13:54 - think that would be very frustrating for
13:55 - the person taking the exam not knowing
13:57 - what the score is but again again I
13:59 - passed it so I'm just telling you like
14:00 - you will pass it but understand that
14:02 - they're just not going to tell you what
14:03 - it is at least not at this time so
14:06 - that's one thing that I found uh stood
14:08 - out there but let's go back over to here
14:10 - and we have the learning path which is
14:12 - on Microsoft learn they might have some
14:14 - content that um that gets covered a
14:16 - little bit differently here I found it
14:18 - not to be uh very good but there was
14:21 - some stuff about like Enterprise um that
14:24 - I don't really go much more into detail
14:26 - where they're talking about like
14:27 - bringing identities it might be
14:29 - this right so again I didn't I didn't
14:32 - look at this until afterwards so yeah I
14:33 - don't really go this full top into this
14:37 - um I do like UFA but um you know you
14:40 - might want to top off in that one
14:41 - section here but the rest I don't know
14:44 - about the rest like in terms of quality
14:46 - it's it's not uh it's not there um so
14:48 - let's go into the study
14:50 - guide and we'll just open that
14:55 - up okay and we have our domains so we
14:59 - have our seven domains and if we go and
15:02 - scroll on
15:05 - down we can see they have git and GitHub
15:08 - Basics so they have like a little bit
15:10 - about expect you know about git like
15:11 - commit and
15:13 - branching um I made sure to include
15:15 - other things like what is
15:17 - remote uh I don't know I have a big list
15:19 - of it it's in the uh we have a uh a git
15:23 - and GitHub quick and dirty crash course
15:24 - to get you through all that stuff we
15:26 - have uh GitHub ident identities so
15:29 - understanding the different types of
15:29 - accounts GitHub markdown what's unusual
15:32 - is like they talk about GitHub markdown
15:34 - but they don't talk about GitHub
15:35 - flavored markdown really odd they have a
15:38 - markdown section but not that GitHub
15:40 - flavored markdown Is Amazing by the way
15:42 - you have GitHub desktop you have GitHub
15:44 - mobile um coming down here all about how
15:47 - to work with GitHub repos um how to work
15:50 - with issues how to work with pull
15:52 - requests how to work with discussions
15:54 - how to work with notifications I don't I
15:57 - even got a question on notifications on
15:59 - my exam uh gists wikis and GitHub Pages
16:02 - nothing on GitHub Pages surprised it
16:04 - didn't promote that a bit more I really
16:05 - like GitHub Pages we have GitHub actions
16:08 - um in this for GitHub actions you know
16:11 - you need to know a little bit about the
16:12 - syntax of the file because I was getting
16:14 - very specific questions about that um
16:17 - co-pilot so we have co-pilot we have
16:19 - code spaces I actually was surprised how
16:22 - little there was on codes spaces but I
16:24 - do do a very thorough CH job of covering
16:26 - codes spaces with us because we need to
16:28 - you utilize it to be effective and so we
16:30 - get a lot more knowledge in that than
16:32 - expected we have uh GitHub projects um
16:36 - it's weird because they say GitHub
16:38 - projects but it's really project
16:39 - management so like labels and Milestones
16:40 - aren't specific to GitHub projects so I
16:43 - kind of broke that up into a different
16:44 - area there and there was some other
16:46 - things that were Project Specific that
16:48 - um um that I uh that I had to put in
16:51 - here and things that I didn't what's
16:53 - weird about GitHub projects is they need
16:54 - they want you to know very specific
16:56 - things like they want you to know um the
16:58 - types of built-in workflows right the
17:01 - types of of charts and that kind of
17:03 - threw me off because they seem so
17:04 - trivial to know but they asked you in
17:06 - the exam so I was surprised this thing
17:08 - is not specific to GitHub projects I'm
17:10 - not sure why they put it in there um but
17:12 - anyway and this this as well so I'm not
17:14 - sure why these are in here or even
17:16 - create template repos these all these
17:18 - here shouldn't be in this section but
17:19 - they are uh we have privacy priv privacy
17:22 - Security Administration so we have a few
17:24 - here uh for uh security then we have
17:27 - GitHub admin rtion I might call it
17:29 - administrator I'm not sure why but I
17:31 - might messed that up this is supposed to
17:33 - be about like the management of your
17:34 - repo I actually covered a lot of it in
17:36 - the GitHub repo section so I end up
17:38 - repeating the content a little bit we
17:40 - have the benefits of the GitHub
17:42 - community so knowing what sponsors is
17:44 - what is open source what is github's
17:46 - relationship with open source um inner
17:48 - source and there you go so yeah I would
17:51 - say that again it's not a hard exam um
17:55 - and I really make sure that you're super
17:57 - prepared for it just make sure you do do
17:59 - uh uh some practice exams just so you
18:02 - don't get caught off and lose some
18:03 - points on that factal information but
18:05 - there you go
18:07 - [Music]
18:10 - okay hey this is Andrew Brown I'm just
18:12 - going to do one ask of you if you can uh
18:15 - if you if you like this course and it
18:17 - helped you out they have this program
18:19 - called GitHub stars and they basically
18:20 - recognize people that did good work uh
18:23 - uh promoting GitHub or educating and
18:25 - communities I think I'm doing that
18:26 - because I'm making a free course and if
18:28 - you want to do me a favor you can go get
18:30 - here to the nominate up at stars.
18:32 - github.com you can say I nominate and it
18:35 - would be like Omen King because it would
18:37 - be something about the actual uh you
18:39 - know like I taught you GitHub and you
18:41 - thought that was really great and I
18:43 - really great greatly appreciate that and
18:45 - you know maybe that way I will go make
18:47 - more of GitHub content and we can help
18:50 - the community more so there you
18:52 - [Music]
18:55 - go hey this is angrew brown and we are
18:57 - taking a look at Version Control Systems
18:59 - which are designed to track changes or
19:01 - revisions to code and there's been a lot
19:03 - of software over the years that helped
19:04 - us do that we had CVS aers mercal and
19:07 - get so back uh in 1990s when we got
19:11 - CVS though even though we had it I don't
19:13 - think a lot of companies were using it
19:14 - it took some time to adopt if you ever
19:16 - heard of like Doom or Wolfenstein you'd
19:18 - be uh interested to learn they didn't
19:19 - use Version Control Systems and what
19:22 - they would do is they would literally
19:24 - copy files onto floppies and hope that
19:26 - they don't lose their files but of
19:28 - course AV Version Control Systems makes
19:30 - it really easy to not worry about losing
19:33 - floppies or CDs or drives because they
19:35 - keep track of all the history then came
19:37 - subversion in 2000 but the real game
19:40 - Cher was in 2005 when we were introduced
19:43 - to a new type A version control system
19:45 - and we had Mercurial and get um but the
19:48 - key difference between the old ones and
19:50 - the new ones was the old ones were
19:51 - centralized and the new ones were
19:53 - decentralized and these decentralized
19:55 - ones became very popular for very
19:57 - specific reason reasons they had full
20:00 - local history and complete control of
20:02 - the repo locally they were
20:03 - straightforward and efficient for
20:05 - branching and merging which was a really
20:07 - big deal uh better performance improve
20:09 - fall tolerance flexible workflows work
20:12 - fully offline um and out of the two git
20:16 - was the one that won and there are
20:18 - reasons for that we'll talk about that
20:19 - when we look at version control services
20:22 - um but uh yeah git is the one that
20:24 - everybody is using today and that's why
20:26 - we are taking this course I just want to
20:28 - point out they're going to come across a
20:30 - lot of terms that sound like trees tree
20:32 - trunk branches um the reason for this is
20:35 - that Version Control represents um the
20:39 - revisions or changes in a graph-like
20:42 - structure you can even say a dag um if
20:44 - you're familiar with that and so uh you
20:47 - know you'll see these terms and we're
20:48 - not talking about real trees we're
20:50 - talking about uh the components of a
20:52 - verion control so there you
20:57 - go
20:58 - [Music]
21:00 - hey this is Angie Brown and we are
21:01 - taking a look at git so git is a
21:03 - distributed Version Control System a
21:06 - dvcs that's going to be hard to remember
21:09 - uh and it's created by lonus torold if
21:11 - you've ever seen that name before you
21:14 - might know that lonus is the creator of
21:16 - the Linux kernel but he is also the
21:19 - creator of git and git right now resides
21:22 - with the Linux Foundation which I
21:23 - believe is a nonprofit set up by Linus
21:27 - as well or has some a part to do with it
21:29 - where a lot of Open Source projects
21:31 - reside um but you know I don't really
21:33 - want to focus on that I want to focus on
21:35 - the practicalities of git so the idea
21:37 - with Git is that each change of your
21:39 - code a git commit can be captured and
21:42 - tracked through the history of your
21:44 - project a git tree so I'm going to get
21:46 - my pen tool out here for just a second
21:49 - and so I just want to make this very
21:50 - clear so we have over here a file and a
21:54 - get commit can or a commit can be made
21:57 - up of multiple files with multiple
21:59 - changes in them and then they're
22:00 - represented over with a a a message okay
22:04 - so here this is a single um git commit
22:07 - and it can have multiple files and uh
22:09 - files and changes in that single one and
22:11 - then that's your tree okay so hopefully
22:14 - that is clear if it's not don't worry
22:15 - we'll get Hands-On skills and we'll
22:17 - definitely be able to remember them
22:18 - later I want to take a look at a bunch
22:20 - of common get terms um and it doesn't
22:24 - matter if you remember these now but you
22:25 - will know what they are hopefully by the
22:27 - end of this course um and so there is
22:30 - this nice graphic here that is provided
22:32 - by Wikipedia that gives an idea of how
22:35 - all of these terms uh work together uh
22:38 - but let's go quickly through them and
22:40 - see what we can make sense of so the
22:41 - first term is a repository this
22:43 - represents the logical container holding
22:45 - the codebase in fact you you could
22:47 - interchange the word codebase repository
22:50 - and mostly mean the same thing we have a
22:52 - Commit This represents a change of data
22:54 - in the local
22:55 - repository and so um that's pretty clear
22:59 - then we have the tree this represents
23:00 - the entire history of a of a repo so
23:02 - when you see tree just think of that
23:04 - graph we have remote uh this is a
23:06 - version of your project hosted elsewhere
23:08 - used for exchanging commits uh some
23:10 - people might be a bit uh picky about
23:12 - this because they might say remote is
23:14 - actually a remote reference to a
23:15 - repository so it's pointing it's a
23:18 - pointer but I'm just going to make it
23:20 - think that it's a remote uh repo it's
23:22 - just somewhere else and there uh there
23:24 - are branches so these are Divergent path
23:26 - to development allowing isolate Chang
23:28 - you're absolutely going to know what
23:29 - branches are you're absolutely going to
23:30 - have to work with them quite a bit um
23:32 - there is a branch known as Maine it was
23:35 - formerly known as Master uh the word was
23:37 - changed because it was not a popular
23:39 - term anymore and so now main is the new
23:42 - name uh and this is usually the default
23:45 - Branch or the base
23:47 - Branch uh if that makes sense there too
23:49 - so we have clone this creates a complete
23:52 - local copy of a repository including its
23:54 - history so this will create like a
23:56 - littleg folder um so it's not just the
23:58 - contents of the files but some
24:00 - configuration around the git repo we
24:03 - have checkouts so this switches between
24:04 - different branches or commits in your
24:05 - repo we have pull so this downloads
24:08 - changes from a remote repository merges
24:10 - them into your branch we have push this
24:13 - uploads your local repository changes to
24:15 - a remote repository we have fetch this
24:18 - downloads data from a remote repo
24:19 - without integrating it into your work um
24:22 - we have reset so undoes local changes
24:25 - without options to unstage revert
24:26 - commits we have merge this combines
24:29 - multiple commit histories into one we
24:32 - have staging files this prepares and
24:34 - organizes uh changes for commits it's
24:37 - not a command but like it's just where
24:39 - you would work with your files um in the
24:42 - uh example here I'm just going to get my
24:43 - pen tool out again it's kind of over
24:45 - here it has to relate with this up here
24:47 - as well and So within staging files
24:50 - we're going to have commits which we
24:52 - already talked about prior and then
24:54 - there's that add command so adding
24:56 - things that will get committed so
24:58 - hopefully that makes sense and we'll see
25:00 - you in the next one
25:01 - [Music]
25:04 - okay hey this is SRE Brown and we are
25:06 - taking a look at version control
25:08 - services and if you're thinking that we
25:10 - already covered this it looks that way
25:12 - but the other one was Version Control
25:14 - Systems this one is version control
25:16 - services and yes they have the same
25:18 - initialism which is confusing but it's
25:20 - very important to make that distinction
25:22 - because those are two separate things so
25:25 - version control services are fully
25:27 - managed services that host your version
25:29 - controlled repositories these Services
25:32 - often have additional functionality
25:33 - going Beyond just being a remote host
25:36 - for your repos git is the most popular
25:38 - and often the only choice for a VCS and
25:42 - we often call these get only uh
25:45 - providers get providers um I need to
25:48 - also point out that some people call
25:51 - version control services Version Control
25:53 - Systems and vice versa and it just gets
25:56 - really confusing so I did did my best to
25:58 - make that clear distinction between the
26:00 - two okay let's take a look at some vcs's
26:04 - so the first here is GitHub and it's
26:06 - owned by Microsoft it's the most popular
26:08 - VCS uh due to offering uh due to its
26:12 - ease of use offering and being around
26:14 - the longest at least forgit um and
26:16 - they've always been very developer
26:18 - focused and super friendly uh GitHub is
26:20 - primarily where open source projects are
26:22 - hosted and offer Rich functionalities
26:23 - such as issue tracking automation
26:25 - pipelines and a host of other features I
26:28 - remember the day GitHub came out and I
26:30 - signed up for it because I was so done
26:33 - with using subversion then came along
26:36 - gitlab so gitlab was an emerging
26:38 - competitor to GitHub and at the time had
26:40 - unique features such as cicd Pipeline
26:42 - and improve security measures this is no
26:45 - longer the case as GitHub is now on par
26:48 - with gitlab um but yeah at one point a
26:50 - lot of people were looking at gitlab
26:52 - then there's bit bucket this one is
26:53 - owned by at laian you might have heard
26:55 - of laian before because they are are uh
26:58 - the same company that makes jira and
27:00 - jira is the most commonly used project
27:04 - manager uh for um people in Tech so you
27:09 - know even though GitHub is really great
27:10 - for developers a lot of companies still
27:12 - use bitbucket and the interesting thing
27:14 - about bitbucket was that they originally
27:16 - hosted Mercurial so remember I said back
27:19 - in 2005 mercal and get came out well
27:22 - alatan adopted mercal GitHub adopted um
27:26 - git and
27:28 - git one and GitHub one and so what's
27:30 - really interesting is that bitbucket
27:33 - then eventually added git and then
27:35 - sunsetted mercal so everything basically
27:38 - is get now there is another provider
27:40 - called sourceforge they're one of the
27:42 - oldest places to host your source code
27:44 - they existed before GitHub um and they
27:46 - were the first uh to provide free of
27:50 - charge um uh get repository hosting to
27:53 - open source projects um the only thing
27:56 - about Source Forge is that they never
27:58 - really dominated because they just had
28:01 - so many ads and bad practices and so it
28:05 - just didn't work out for them they are
28:06 - still around and a lot of Open Source
28:09 - projects like to only host there they
28:11 - might mirror make a copy to other
28:13 - providers like GitHub um but for the
28:15 - most part everybody's on GitHub um but
28:18 - there you
28:19 - [Music]
28:22 - go hey this is Andrew Brown we are
28:25 - taking a look at GitHub and this is a
28:27 - version controlled service that
28:29 - initially offered hosted manag remote
28:31 - get repos and is expanded to provide
28:33 - other offerings around hosted code bases
28:36 - if you go look up what GitHub calls
28:38 - themselves today they call themselves
28:40 - like an AI uh developer powered platform
28:44 - um it's really bizarre because they are
28:46 - basically a host for uh for get repos
28:49 - with extra stuff on top of it but I
28:51 - guess since AI is so popular they got to
28:53 - try right but let's take a look at all
28:55 - the functionality that they have so we
28:57 - have get repository hosting that is
28:58 - their main bread and butter we have
29:01 - project management tools issue tracking
29:03 - PLL requests and code reviews GitHub
29:05 - pages and wikis GitHub actions GitHub
29:08 - co-pilot GitHub code spaces GitHub
29:11 - Marketplace GitHub gists GitHub
29:14 - discussions collaboration features for
29:16 - organization organizations and teams API
29:20 - access development so GitHub development
29:22 - they have a GitHub CLI they have
29:25 - sdks um we have security features autod
29:27 - detecting credentials in repos they have
29:30 - education specific things or course
29:32 - automation like GitHub classroom and I'm
29:35 - sure they have more uh we're going to
29:37 - learn about all of these things because
29:38 - this is what the GitHub course is about
29:40 - to understand the full offering of
29:42 - GitHub and to make best use of it and
29:44 - just a fun fact is that GitHub was
29:46 - originally built in Ruby on Rails Ruby
29:48 - is my favorite language rails is my
29:50 - favorite framework so I've been uh uh on
29:53 - the the ride or the train since day one
29:56 - with GitHub um so I know it pretty well
29:58 - but let's jump into it
30:00 - [Music]
30:03 - okay hey everyone this is angrew brown
30:06 - and this fall along I want to show you
30:07 - how to set up UFA or multiactor
30:10 - authentication we'll talk about it later
30:12 - in the course but it's very important
30:14 - that we get this set up early uh so we
30:16 - get it out of the way and that's our
30:17 - opportunity to also install a really
30:19 - useful application called GitHub mobile
30:22 - so I'm going to go into Google and just
30:24 - type in GitHub mobile so we can take a
30:25 - look and so what GitHub mobile is it's
30:28 - an application that allows you to U
30:31 - basically interact with um uh GitHub on
30:34 - your phone but the major reason why I
30:37 - want you to install it is because it's
30:38 - also used as a uh authentication tool
30:42 - for GitHub now you can use another tool
30:44 - if you already have Google Authenticator
30:46 - Microsoft authenticator aie you can use
30:49 - what you want to use and you can
30:50 - actually add both of them there but I
30:52 - find the easiest way to um do UFA is to
30:55 - use G uh GitHub mobile mobile so I
30:58 - really do recommend that you install
30:59 - it's for both Google Play and your Apple
31:02 - phones I'm on screen for a second sorry
31:03 - for the uh the upward camera I'm in
31:06 - standing desk mode right now but the
31:07 - idea is that you're looking for the app
31:09 - it's literally just called I if you can
31:11 - see it GitHub right so you want to
31:13 - install that
31:14 - application okay so here it's showing my
31:17 - profile as I'm logged in here and this
31:19 - will be what we use to log in or confirm
31:22 - when we log in the future so what I'm
31:24 - going to do is go up here I'm going to
31:25 - turn off the video so I don't have to
31:26 - look at my self and we're going to go
31:29 - over
31:30 - to um settings I would think and then
31:33 - from here it' probably be under
31:36 - passwords and authentication and so if
31:38 - we scroll on down um I mean there is a
31:41 - passwordless way of logging I have yet
31:43 - to use that but what we're looking at is
31:45 - the two Factor authentication I'm going
31:47 - to go ahead and enable that now what's
31:49 - interesting is that if you have a lot of
31:53 - um open source contributions you have to
31:55 - have UFA turned on so in my account they
31:58 - turned it on for me they said I couldn't
32:00 - use my GitHub account unless they turned
32:01 - it on but we have this QR code so what
32:04 - I'm going to do is I'm just going to
32:06 - take a quick look here um I mean this is
32:09 - one way of doing
32:11 - it I guess we could do text message as
32:13 - well let's go back here because I
32:14 - thought if you had the GitHub mobile
32:17 - application it would showed here but
32:18 - since we have nothing attached we'll
32:20 - have to attach something so I'm going to
32:21 - go here I'm just going to carefully look
32:23 - here and
32:26 - um
32:28 - you know what I'm going to do s no I'm
32:30 - going to stick with the authenticator so
32:31 - I already have aie installed um so I'm
32:34 - going to use that I really like aie it's
32:36 - by twilio and I find it is one of the
32:38 - most light ways of um getting a
32:41 - multiactor
32:42 - authentication so I'm just going to show
32:44 - you what it looks like again on my phone
32:47 - but I really want to
32:48 - use GitHub mobile but I'm really
32:51 - surprised that they don't show that in
32:52 - the setup
32:54 - but yeah so for example this is uh aie
32:58 - it's really simple you put in a pin and
33:00 - then you can get into your actual codes
33:01 - uh that rotate out um so you can go
33:04 - install that it's in the Google Play
33:05 - Store and
33:06 - the iOS Apple Store but um I guess I'll
33:10 - add that so what I'm going to do is scan
33:12 - this QR code with my phone and all
33:14 - phones can scan QR codes you just open
33:17 - your photo app and hover over and it'll
33:20 - pick it up you'll get a link and you'll
33:21 - click through and then it'll ask you
33:23 - what app you want to open with and so I
33:25 - already have ai installed so I'm going
33:27 - to click
33:29 - aie if you want to see this again I'm
33:32 - trying to show as much as I can on my
33:33 - phone but it's asking me what app do I
33:35 - want to open with aie after scanning
33:37 - that code
33:39 - right and I'll say uh this time yes and
33:44 - then uh I have a pin so I'm have to
33:46 - enter my pin
33:49 - in
33:51 - okay and ay opened but it didn't
33:53 - automatically add it so what I'm going
33:55 - to have to do in aie I'll just show you
33:57 - this for a
33:58 - second because I thought it would add it
34:00 - but it didn't so I'm going have to say
34:02 - add account at the top there's a little
34:04 - drop down for for that okay so now it's
34:08 - asking me to scan the QR code so I'm
34:10 - going to do
34:13 - that okay and so it's Brad it in here
34:15 - and so now I have it here it says GitHub
34:17 - and then my username I'm going to hit
34:19 - save and so now I have a code and so
34:22 - that's the code I need to enter in all
34:23 - right so I'll just turn off my screen
34:25 - and enter the code in as quick as I can
34:28 - 705 839 really doesn't matter if I tell
34:31 - you this code out loud and now we have
34:33 - our backup codes you should never share
34:35 - your backup codes with anybody this is a
34:37 - way that people can get into your
34:38 - account um I really did not mean to show
34:40 - them to you here I'll have to do some
34:42 - editing to um hide them okay so I've
34:45 - downloaded my codes and make sure you
34:47 - print out these codes and you put them
34:49 - somewhere safe and have it offline do
34:51 - not have it online that's the whole
34:53 - point so go get the special duang you
34:56 - have permission to go buy some uh
34:59 - stationary and put that in and put it
35:01 - somewhere safe okay so I have mine
35:04 - downloaded to my computer and I'll go
35:05 - print it out later and what we'll do is
35:08 - we'll go ahead and say I have saved my
35:09 - recovery codes and so now it shows
35:12 - GitHub mobile this is so silly the
35:14 - GitHub mobile app on your phone can be
35:16 - used as UFA enable it by installing the
35:18 - GitHub mobile app so maybe the reason it
35:20 - didn't work was because I didn't sign
35:21 - into it so if I had signed into it
35:23 - initially maybe we didn't have to do
35:24 - this to begin with so what I'm going to
35:26 - do is just go hit
35:28 - done and I still think again it's easier
35:30 - to use the GitHub mobile app so I'm
35:32 - going to go and see if I can log out of
35:35 - GitHub mobile and log into this other
35:36 - account or maybe I can be logged into
35:38 - both of them at the same time so I'm
35:40 - opening up GitHub
35:42 - here
35:43 - and I'm just seeing if I can be logged
35:46 - into
35:47 - multiples so what I've noticed here I'm
35:49 - logged in already I just want to show
35:50 - you
35:52 - something so here I am
35:55 - in GitHub mobile and there's a little
35:57 - Cog at the top so I'm going to click
35:59 - that Cog and then I have my settings
36:02 - right and I'm going to scroll on down
36:04 - and there's I think that says accounts I
36:07 - know I'm sorry about the glare so
36:08 - there's accounts I'm going to click
36:10 - accounts and it looks like that I can
36:12 - add multiple accounts and that's what
36:14 - I'm going to do okay so I'm going to go
36:15 - ahead and hit add account and it's going
36:17 - to ask me to sign in with GitHub okay so
36:20 - I'm going hit the big white blob of a
36:22 - button and then it's going to show this
36:25 - here sign in with different account
36:27 - so I'm going to go ahead and use a
36:29 - different account and I'm have to enter
36:31 - my uh username email and password so
36:34 - just give me a moment
36:38 - okay all right so I had to like email
36:41 - myself my password because my my Dash
36:44 - Lan wasn't letting me log in but once
36:45 - you're there you're going to see the
36:47 - that authentication code that it's going
36:48 - to want so I'm going to go grab that
36:49 - from aie and it's good to have ay
36:52 - installed I like having it uh because
36:53 - you can't use GitHub authenticator for
36:55 - everything so I'm going to go real real
36:56 - quick and put that code
36:58 - in nope I missed it so I'm going to have
37:01 - to try that again sometimes you miss it
37:03 - you'll have to try it
37:05 - twice
37:10 - okay there we go it's going to ask uh to
37:13 - get access to authorize It Go Down Below
37:16 - say authorize GitHub that green button
37:19 - there and it's signing me
37:21 - in and it looks like I'm now in so I'm
37:24 - now in here with my account I imagine I
37:26 - can switch between the two what I'm
37:28 - going to do is just turn off my screen
37:30 - here and let's take a look and see if
37:32 - this is showing up now so we'll give
37:33 - this a refresh and there it is so it's
37:35 - now configured so the idea here is that
37:37 - you can also set the default so again I
37:39 - would recommend GitHub mobile doesn't
37:41 - hurt to have more than one but I find
37:43 - this to be super convenient because um
37:47 - it like when you go through this you
37:48 - only have to enter in like two letters
37:50 - it's a lot faster it'll it'll it'll jump
37:54 - up on your screen whereas these other
37:55 - authenticators will not not um so that's
37:58 - my recommendation to you there and now
38:00 - that we have two Factor we are in great
38:02 - shape I'm going to just go back to Home
38:03 - by clicking the octocat and uh that's it
38:06 - so I'll see you in the next one okay
38:09 - [Music]
38:12 - ciao hey this is angre brown and in this
38:15 - fall along I want to show you how to
38:17 - create your own GitHub account every
38:19 - single developer on the planet should
38:21 - have a GitHub account because it's a
38:23 - great way to Showcase your work uh we'll
38:25 - talk about that later but you can see
38:27 - that I'm already logged in here so I
38:28 - already have a GitHub account and what
38:30 - I'm going to do is log out and I'm going
38:33 - to create a new one from scratch so here
38:36 - we can see uh we can have multiple ones
38:38 - um I'm going to just sign out of all of
38:39 - my accounts here and let's go ahead and
38:42 - create ourselves a new one so I'm not
38:44 - sure remember I told earlier I told you
38:45 - they're like the leading AI power
38:47 - developer platform which is such a silly
38:48 - term but um let's go ahead and see if we
38:51 - can make a new one so just in case it's
38:52 - a future and they've changed this
38:53 - homepage I'm going to go up to sign up
38:56 - and and I'm going to see if I can make
38:58 - an account if I can find an email that
39:00 - has not been used so far so I'm going to
39:03 - type and your exam prod. so if you're
39:05 - using Gmail so I can't use that one if
39:07 - you're using Gmail you can use like plus
39:09 - signs to um create multiple ones so like
39:11 - my really really personal email don't
39:13 - email me because I don't ever check this
39:15 - one it's like Omen King gmail.com you'll
39:17 - learn that my username on GitHub is Omen
39:20 - King why is that I don't want to talk
39:23 - about it it's like forever ago I made
39:25 - this account like so long ago and I
39:27 - really wish I could have got Andrew
39:29 - Brown as my username but that's not what
39:30 - it is and so I'm just going to go here
39:32 - and say alt okay so this is a trick with
39:35 - Gmail that you can do you can put a plus
39:37 - alt on it or uh maybe a minus I'm not
39:39 - sure but let's go ahead and see if that
39:41 - works and I need to create a password so
39:44 - I like to generate really strong
39:46 - passwords um you can use whatever you
39:48 - want I like to use hold on here I like
39:52 - to use this site which is
39:54 - the uh password generator plus password
39:57 - generator.net um I should make a
40:00 - disclaimer if this isn't insecure don't
40:02 - use it blah blah blah but I'm pretty
40:03 - sure it's fine so I'll us to go like 24
40:06 - and get a nice long password um and I'll
40:09 - just generate a few different ones off
40:10 - screen here and I'm going to enter that
40:11 - in okay so just generate out a few and
40:15 - I'm going to drop this in on here okay
40:18 - we're going to hit continue says it's
40:19 - strong that's good and then I got to
40:22 - choose my username so I probably can't
40:24 - get Andrew
40:25 - Brown and um so I need like another name
40:29 - I'm going to try
40:31 - Dono not available that's like my game
40:34 - uh gamer uh tag on um steam so what's
40:39 - another one that I could have uh we'll
40:41 - just say Andrew Cloud can I get that one
40:45 - so hard we'll just say Andrew WC Brown
40:48 - Canon I get that there we go WC is my M
40:52 - middle initials it doesn't stand for
40:54 - water closet okay I know it looks like
40:57 - that we'll go ahead and hit continue I
40:59 - hit continue again and so now what I
41:01 - need to do is do this verification
41:03 - please solve this puzzle so we know
41:04 - you're a real
41:06 - person uh verify okay use the arrows to
41:10 - rotate the object to the face in the
41:12 - direction of the
41:14 - hand okay use the arrows so I think I
41:17 - have to make it face the same way match
41:19 - the
41:20 - angle okay uh this
41:24 - way okay
41:27 - there we
41:28 - go create my
41:30 - account and so now I need to open up
41:32 - that email just give me a moment okay
41:35 - all right so I've been waiting a few
41:36 - minutes and I haven't seen anything and
41:37 - I resent the code so maybe it doesn't
41:39 - like emails that have that plus in there
41:42 - it's totally possible so I might
41:44 - actually have to go ahead and create a
41:45 - new email which is quite the headache as
41:47 - I've ran out of emails here uh unless I
41:50 - can think of another one you know what I
41:52 - think I have another idea I'm going to
41:55 - use uh a different one here so it looks
41:58 - like unverified can I change this I'm G
42:01 - to try um because you have an privacy uh
42:05 - privacy email uh will be used for
42:09 - account related stuff um yeah I'm not
42:12 - really sure what's going on here I
42:14 - thought maybe my account even exists but
42:15 - it looks like it already does
42:20 - exist so what I'm going to do is I'm
42:22 - just going to add another one I can do
42:23 - Andrew maybe at teacher seat.com we'll
42:26 - try
42:28 - that oh it's already in use oh my
42:31 - goodness it's so hard to get an email
42:33 - out
42:34 - here okay let me just think about this
42:36 - for a second all right all right another
42:38 - thing I'm going to try is I'm going to
42:39 - try uh maybe Accounts at teachers
42:43 - seat.com that's another one that I might
42:45 - be able to
42:46 - use okay and I going to change this over
42:49 - here and save
42:51 - it great
42:55 - and
42:56 - that should be my primary now
43:02 - right it really wants to send it to this
43:05 - one maybe what I can do is I can
43:08 - click oh looks like we have both okay so
43:10 - we have this one um please verify that
43:12 - I'm going to get rid of this one here
43:13 - because that one's not working I'm going
43:15 - to try uh accounts teacher.com so that's
43:18 - in my Outlook so I'll go take a look
43:19 - there and see if I get it all right so
43:22 - uh this is working out totally fine so
43:23 - over here we have um the confirmation
43:26 - email so I can go ahead and just verify
43:28 - that email we can also just grab this
43:29 - link I kind of prefer using the link
43:32 - here um because that just gives me kind
43:33 - of a guarantee and we'll go here and now
43:35 - we are in so this is exciting um it's
43:38 - been a long time since I've made a new
43:40 - GitHub account so I'm not sure exactly
43:42 - what to expect but it looks like we have
43:43 - some places we can start stting a new
43:45 - project collaborate with your team learn
43:48 - how to use GitHub hey I'm already doing
43:49 - that you don't need to do that GitHub
43:51 - let's go ahead and skip this for now and
43:53 - we should get back to our main dashboard
43:55 - so we are now in and we have an account
43:59 - that we can use um so yeah that's all I
44:02 - wanted to show you in this video uh but
44:04 - I'll see you in the next one okay
44:07 - [Music]
44:10 - ciao hey this is Angie Brown and this
44:12 - fall along I just want to show you that
44:13 - I'm going to be setting up multiple
44:14 - accounts to quickly switch between them
44:17 - um if you want to take full advantage of
44:20 - learning how to use GitHub you're going
44:22 - to need probably another account because
44:24 - you're going to have to have somebody
44:24 - else to work with so I already have my
44:26 - primary account I already showed you how
44:28 - to make an account so what I want you to
44:29 - do is make a secondary account I know
44:31 - it's a pain but go ahead and do that but
44:34 - what I'm going to do in this video is
44:35 - show you how you can log into both and
44:37 - switch between the two and I'm also
44:39 - going to set up a
44:40 - repository um that I'm going to put code
44:42 - examples in if we happen to put any in
44:44 - there so what I'm going to do is go up
44:45 - here at the top right corner I'm going
44:47 - to go add account and so this is going
44:48 - to allow me to log into my other account
44:50 - I can put in my username or my email so
44:52 - this one is um this is monsterbox
44:55 - pro.com that's my old my old company
44:58 - that's not been around for a long time
44:59 - but I've never updated it and the exam
45:01 - Pro email is on a another GitHub account
45:04 - but I'm going to go ahead and find the
45:06 - password so I can go log into this one
45:08 - so just give me a moment I'm just trying
45:09 - to find it here it is there is the
45:13 - password I'm going to paste it in here
45:16 - okay we'll hit sign
45:17 - in okay notice it says GitHub mobile so
45:20 - now it's my opportunity to show you
45:22 - GitHub mobile so what I'm doing is I'm
45:24 - opening up my phone
45:26 - and right away it pops up it says uh you
45:29 - know new signin request now it says
45:32 - reject or approve I'm going to hit
45:33 - approve it says authentication request
45:35 - was approved uh the first time I I had
45:37 - to do that I had to enter in like a code
45:38 - like two numbers but now from then on I
45:41 - just have to do that and it's very easy
45:42 - to uh to do that so if I want to switch
45:44 - between accounts we can go here and just
45:46 - switch between them uh freely so that is
45:49 - really easy and so what I want to do is
45:51 - go to exam Pro this is my other
45:53 - organization you'll learn about
45:54 - organizations in this
45:56 - um this here that didn't really help but
45:58 - what I want to do is create a new repo I
46:00 - can create a new one up here in green or
46:02 - I can go up here I never notice these up
46:04 - here but this is another place to do
46:05 - that anyway you're just watching you're
46:08 - not doing right now okay so I'm going to
46:10 - go ahead and hit new and in here I'm
46:12 - going to go to exam Pro I'm going to say
46:16 - um GitHub examples so this will be the
46:20 - um
46:22 - GitHub we'll say a repo containing
46:27 - GitHub examples for Pro for programmatic
46:31 - examples for
46:33 - programmatic examples this will be
46:35 - public because I want you to have access
46:36 - to it I want to have a read me I'm going
46:38 - to create that repository and so this
46:39 - will crop up later in the course and
46:42 - you'll have to know where this this is
46:43 - but just remember that is but the key
46:45 - part of this video was how to log into
46:47 - another account um and be able to switch
46:49 - between them okay so we'll see you in
46:50 - the next one
46:54 - ciao
46:56 - all right so what I want to do in this
46:58 - fall along is set up a GitHub
47:00 - organization and the reason we want to
47:02 - do this is so that uh it's going to make
47:04 - it easier when we get to that section so
47:07 - what I'm going to do is go to the top
47:09 - right corner and I want to I can make
47:12 - this in either or account I'm going to
47:13 - make it in the alternate account because
47:15 - I already have enough organizations in
47:16 - my main GitHub account and what I want
47:19 - to do is go over here to um maybe
47:24 - organizations and here it says uh you
47:27 - are not a member of an organization we
47:29 - could turn this account into an
47:30 - organization I don't want to do that or
47:32 - we can make a new org so I'm going to
47:34 - make a new org and notice right away
47:36 - it's going to hit us with some pricing
47:38 - so um you know teams gives you the full
47:41 - functionality we just want to have the
47:43 - free one uh which might have some
47:45 - limitations but um it should get us
47:47 - started if there's are things that we
47:49 - can't do um then I'll switch over to our
47:52 - paid one that I have in my account for
47:53 - the most part we should be able to do um
47:55 - pretty much everything as long as we're
47:57 - using a public GitHub um public GitHub
48:01 - repo so I'm gonna go ahead and hit
48:02 - create a free
48:03 - organization and so I need some kind of
48:05 - name for this
48:07 - organization um
48:08 - [Music]
48:10 - so I don't know but we'll just say uh
48:15 - GitHub Cloud Learners or
48:23 - journeyers okay notice that's be the
48:25 - name of
48:26 - it I say Accounts at teacher
48:32 - seat.com and this organization belongs
48:34 - to a personal account we could say uh
48:37 - business or institution but then we get
48:39 - a little bit more details there so I'm
48:40 - going to just stick it to normal and go
48:42 - to personal account then down below we
48:44 - need to solve our puzzle so we've seen
48:47 - this one before we'll rotate that out
48:48 - and we'll
48:50 - submit
48:51 - okay and you'll have to name your
48:53 - organization whatever you have to name
48:55 - it but that's what I'm calling M you can
48:57 - put some numbers on the end here if that
48:58 - makes it easier you do like four five
48:59 - six s or something because these are
49:01 - going to be unique names just like your
49:02 - your username going to go ahead and hit
49:04 - next and so now it says add organization
49:07 - members so we can go ahead and add some
49:08 - people so what I want to do is I want to
49:11 - add um Omen king so I'm going to go
49:14 - ahead and do that please don't add me
49:16 - all right add your own other account
49:19 - your two
49:20 - accounts okay we'll hit complete setup
49:23 - and so now this person has been invited
49:25 - not sure if they're instantly added um
49:29 - not yet but I believe that I was yeah
49:32 - here's the invitation so we'll go here
49:34 - so the invite has been sent and we'll
49:37 - have to go look for that so I'm going to
49:38 - go over here and switch to my other
49:40 - account okay and so now what I'll do is
49:44 - I'll click up here and maybe it's up
49:46 - here my
49:48 - notifications
49:50 - no do I have invites
49:53 - here no
49:56 - and um maybe I got an email check my
50:00 - email no email and this is something
50:03 - you'll learn about GitHub which is like
50:04 - invites are a pain and you always have
50:06 - to really figure it out so I'm just
50:08 - trying to think about where that or that
50:10 - could be um what we could try to do is
50:12 - type in the organization name which I
50:14 - thought we already
50:16 - did um
50:18 - so this one let's see my profile is
50:22 - this yeah so the organization's going to
50:24 - be what was it cloud
50:27 - oh I don't even
50:28 - remember we'll switch back to the other
50:30 - one what a
50:31 - pain okay and we will look for that
50:36 - organization GitHub Cloud journeyer so
50:38 - I'm just going to copy this
50:40 - URL I want the um view organization I
50:43 - want to go to this page actually I'm
50:45 - going to copy it here I'm go switch
50:49 - back and I'll enter this
50:52 - in and so now notice that it's showing
50:55 - me where the invitation is so it says
50:56 - Andrew Brown invited you to join this
50:59 - organization view
51:01 - invitations okay and I I don't know if
51:04 - there is but I'm just going to double
51:05 - check here because a lot of times GitHub
51:07 - will have like invitations invitations
51:11 - they might have a page for it they don't
51:13 - GitHub if you're watching make a SL
51:15 - invitations page so we can easily find
51:16 - them across them here so as you've been
51:18 - invited to GitHub Cloud Juniors ask for
51:21 - a GitHub co-pilot seat optional I guess
51:23 - this is kind of an upsell they're like
51:25 - hey do you want to be able to use GitHub
51:27 - co-pilot but I'm going to go ahead and
51:29 - join this organization and now I'm in
51:31 - there so there's two people in here
51:33 - again we'll come back to this later I'm
51:35 - the member this is the
51:37 - owner um and uh you know if your company
51:41 - is using GitHub they're likely going to
51:42 - be using using organization so it's good
51:44 - to get some knowledge on that but I'll
51:45 - see you in the next one
51:48 - [Music]
51:51 - ciao all right so I'm on the my oat.com
51:54 - and we can go ahead and build our own
51:57 - octocat so what I'll do is create your
51:59 - octocat you also getting started we'll
52:02 - do the exact same thing and it'll have a
52:05 - fun little animation here there's no
52:06 - audio but it's kind of showing you
52:10 - something we'll give it a moment here
52:11 - and so now we have the default octocat
52:14 - and we can do something fun so you can
52:16 - choose obviously a color I'm just going
52:18 - to go down one shade here for face um
52:21 - I'm pretty pale so let's go real pale
52:23 - here these just look like off colors to
52:26 - me but we'll do that for eyes we could
52:28 - choose anything else but I usually will
52:30 - do glasses so it's not going to matter
52:31 - anyway so if I go down here uh I'm going
52:34 - to want some glasses
52:36 - on uh we'll go to mouth we'll choose
52:39 - something there you can choose hair
52:41 - there's probably something that kind of
52:42 - looks like my hair um facial hair it's
52:46 - bizarre because they show like other
52:48 - ones that I could have I don't have a
52:49 - full beard but like they have this one
52:51 - and it doesn't show up do not want
52:53 - mutton chops okay we'll go over here to
52:56 - Tops I'm in Canada so it would probably
52:59 - make sense if I was to choose the
53:01 - Canadian
53:02 - one I know it's somewhere
53:05 - here where are you it was here the other
53:12 - day I wonder if this is like region
53:14 - specific nope there it is okay so I have
53:17 - Canada um I'm going to keep the bottoms
53:19 - off maybe have some
53:22 - skates
53:24 - and got a toque I should be wearing a
53:26 - toque shouldn't
53:31 - I no any accessories props whatever you
53:35 - want to have and the funny part is I
53:38 - don't play hockey but this looks good
53:40 - enough so what I want to do is save it
53:42 - so we can share
53:44 - it I'm not sure what happens if we do
53:46 - that click the share button oh that
53:48 - downloads the file so that's perfect so
53:50 - now we can use that as our profile I'm
53:52 - just going to quickly open that up in
53:54 - Explorer
53:55 - it's opening somewhere on my computer
53:58 - I'm sure it went to downloads but I'm
53:59 - going to go ahead and close that out I'm
54:01 - going to switch back over to my other
54:05 - account and obviously for your primary
54:07 - account you should treat it like a
54:08 - profile just like your LinkedIn profile
54:10 - if you're alternate alternate it doesn't
54:12 - really matter we're just goofing around
54:14 - so if we go over to um profile it's
54:18 - still not showing up here it is great so
54:19 - I want to go ahead and change this I'm
54:20 - going to change my avatar and then I'll
54:22 - click
54:24 - here
54:27 - and I'm just going to move this off
54:29 - screen here and I'm going to go find
54:33 - it there it is right
54:35 - there I'll hit
54:38 - open and there it
54:41 - is say Andrew
54:46 - Brown okay alt
54:50 - account this is Andrew
54:53 - Browns so at sign Omen King's alternate
54:58 - account for the
55:00 - purpose of learning GitHub since you
55:04 - need another GitHub account to make use
55:09 - of learning all of
55:25 - update our profile all right I can go
55:28 - and view my personal profile and I mean
55:31 - that should be
55:32 - there I don't see it we'll go back to
55:34 - edit I'm going click it again maybe it
55:36 - didn't upload it is there so probably
55:38 - what's happening is it's just a caching
55:40 - issue right um and so it's just going to
55:43 - take some time for that to show up so or
55:46 - maybe if I open it up another browser it
55:47 - will show up there but you know
55:49 - eventually it'll show up and I'm not
55:50 - really worried about it but that was
55:52 - octocat so um yeah I'll see you the next
55:55 - one okay
55:58 - [Music]
56:01 - ciao let's take a look at GitHub octocat
56:04 - so this is github's official mascot and
56:07 - it's a cat because and an octopus
56:10 - because it's supposed to symbolize
56:11 - friendly and engaging nature in the
56:12 - world of software development
56:14 - collaboration I don't know if I believe
56:15 - that but it looks cool so cool uh you
56:18 - can actually create your own octocat I
56:20 - thought that'd be a great opportunity
56:21 - for us to create a profile for our
56:23 - alternate alternate account or for both
56:26 - whichever you want to do you will see
56:28 - octocat in other places so um they have
56:31 - a bot that's called octocat that is used
56:33 - throughout the platform their SDK is
56:35 - called octo kit so you're going to see
56:37 - that themes in a few other places so you
56:39 - know where that is originating from
56:42 - [Music]
56:45 - okay all right let's make sure we
56:48 - understand clearly the difference
56:49 - between git and GitHub I don't think
56:51 - it's that confusing but it is in the
56:53 - study guide or exam outline so so I'm
56:55 - just trying to make content that they
56:56 - want us to know um so let's do a
56:59 - comparison and go through some things to
57:02 - make sure we understand the difference
57:04 - so git is a distributed Version Control
57:06 - System a dbcs and GitHub is a version
57:09 - control as a service I called it a
57:11 - Version Control service it can also be
57:13 - called a get provider or you can call it
57:16 - a version control as a service I'm just
57:17 - trying to get you exposure to all those
57:18 - different terms you could call what
57:20 - GitHub is for functionality for Git it
57:23 - manages source code history for GitHub
57:26 - it provides cloud storage for git repos
57:29 - of course it does more than that but
57:31 - that's its main functionality um for
57:34 - Access you're doing this via your local
57:36 - system installation or it's basically
57:38 - wherever it's installed the point is is
57:40 - that you're working on it on a machine
57:42 - on a server or some kind of compute uh
57:44 - and GitHub is accessed through a web
57:47 - interface because it is a cloud service
57:50 - for the scope we're talking about local
57:52 - repository management and then for
57:54 - GitHub we're actually talking about the
57:55 - online collaboration and remote hosting
57:58 - uh so anything that has to do with
57:59 - remote or things around the repo the git
58:02 - repo itself for collaboration it's for
58:04 - local changes requires manual sharing
58:06 - for GitHub it has integrated tools for
58:09 - collaboration like issues and PR and a
58:11 - lot of other features for usage you're
58:13 - going to be using this primarily by the
58:16 - command line interface there's
58:17 - definitely software out there that makes
58:18 - it a lot easier to use um we'll get into
58:21 - that but generally it's a command line
58:24 - tool that you're using for GitHub it has
58:26 - a graphical interface and it also has
58:28 - its own CLI tool but most people are
58:31 - interacting with it via the website okay
58:34 - so there you go
58:36 - [Music]
58:40 - ciao so a git repo or repository is your
58:44 - git repo think of your local one that
58:46 - you push Upstream to GitHub to be uh
58:49 - hosted remotely and GitHub allows you
58:52 - access to manage your re repo with
58:55 - several functionalities so here is a
58:57 - screenshot of a GitHub repo this is when
59:00 - I ran a boot camp in
59:01 - 2023 uh and so let's talk about what is
59:05 - on this GitHub repo page I don't know
59:07 - what they want to call this page I just
59:08 - called the GitHub repo page for a
59:10 - specific repo um but you can view
59:12 - different branches view tags view commit
59:15 - history explore repo files view releases
59:19 - uh see codebase language breakdown view
59:21 - top level markdown files and so those
59:25 - top level files might be the read me the
59:27 - license security other things like that
59:30 - you can perform actions from this page
59:32 - or quickly to it such as pinning
59:35 - watching forking starring cloning so uh
59:39 - a lot of stuff going on this page and
59:41 - this is going to be we're going to be
59:42 - spending a lot of time or uh going from
59:45 - here to somewhere else but that is a
59:48 - GitHub repo so there you
59:49 - [Music]
59:53 - go all right in this follow along I just
59:55 - want to give you a tour of GitHub repos
59:58 - so that you have a a general Fami
60:01 - familiarity uh so that when we start
60:03 - diving a bit deeper we understand what
60:05 - we're looking at so I'm on my dashboard
60:07 - I have a lot of different repositories
60:10 - um and so I can go here and find a
60:11 - repository I can search stuff and say
60:13 - like if I'm looking for my boot camp I
60:15 - can type in boot camp here and then make
60:17 - my way over here and find it um a lot of
60:19 - times when you are looking for stuff
60:21 - you're going to use the global search so
60:23 - up here you could do that as well well
60:24 - and I could find my own repos or other
60:26 - repos um there are a lot of Open Source
60:29 - repos on GitHub and so um I know rails
60:32 - pretty well so I'll go ahead and type in
60:33 - rails and so we have this rails repo I'm
60:36 - going to go open this open this up and
60:38 - take a look and see what we can see
60:40 - because this is a very mature Li um uh
60:42 - GitHub repo and we'll make it very clear
60:44 - of all the functionality that's
60:45 - happening so notice we have our main
60:48 - area this is where all of our files are
60:50 - uh we can actually view any of these
60:52 - files so I can click into any of them so
60:53 - I can go into the gem file and it will
60:55 - show me the contents of the gem file
60:58 - what I like about uh GitHub is that when
61:00 - you click into here then you kind of get
61:02 - this file explorer and it's extremely
61:04 - powerful uh if I click this on the right
61:06 - hand side it will show me symbols that's
61:08 - not a very good example I might open up
61:09 - a ruby file to show you what I mean so
61:11 - I'm just looking for Ruby file here and
61:14 - so this will show you like places you
61:15 - could jump uh jump towards in your code
61:18 - um that's really nice you can see who
61:21 - did what by going to blame so we can see
61:23 - exactly what some he doing by the way
61:25 - I'm going really quick here it's not
61:27 - important for you to remember any of
61:29 - this I'm just giving you a tour of stuff
61:31 - so just relax and uh enjoy the
61:34 - information that we're learning here you
61:35 - don't have to write it down if I wanted
61:37 - to find a file really quickly in this
61:38 - repo I could go here and type something
61:40 - in so maybe I'm looking for um something
61:43 - like View and so it's going to drop down
61:45 - and it has this fuzzy search if I want
61:47 - to find a ruby file I can type this in
61:49 - we have a lot of them here I believe
61:51 - there's a hotkey here so if I hit T if
61:53 - I'm over here and I hit t T it will
61:55 - bring me over there I can switch
61:57 - branches really easily um does that let
62:00 - me add a file it's not my repo but if I
62:02 - add a file I'd have to create a fork um
62:05 - the search brings that up there but
62:06 - we'll go back over to code okay so my
62:09 - point here is that you have all the
62:11 - files here and you can browse them um
62:13 - you can switch branches you can go and
62:15 - take a look at all of your branches you
62:16 - can take a look at all your tags you can
62:19 - star you can Fork you can watch here for
62:22 - code you could launch this up in code
62:23 - spaces which is a cloud developer
62:26 - environment I normally have um G pod
62:28 - installed so if I hit refresh that
62:30 - button might show up here this button
62:32 - you will not have this button I
62:33 - installed this because it's like code
62:35 - spaces but
62:37 - different um on the right hand side you
62:39 - get a bunch of information about the
62:41 - repo like stars watching Fork uh some of
62:44 - these probably are conditional because I
62:45 - don't remember seeing these on my repos
62:47 - you have releases so maybe you are
62:49 - building up binaries like downloadable
62:51 - files that people can uh utilize so some
62:54 - people they will host all their code
62:56 - here and they'll build the binaries for
62:58 - quick downloads so that's somewhere else
63:00 - you can go to packages is probably
63:02 - similar to releases I don't I don't
63:04 - think I've ever used packages ever in my
63:06 - life uh let's go over here and take a
63:08 - look browse browsing all packages yeah I
63:11 - don't know what packages do we can see
63:14 - who's using it the contributors so
63:16 - people that are writing uh writing code
63:18 - um we have the languages so you can see
63:20 - this is mostly a
63:22 - ruby LI or uh repo which makes sense
63:25 - because it's Ruby on Rails down below we
63:28 - get a preview of our readme file so that
63:30 - is in the top level directory they have
63:32 - a codes of conduct I imagine that is a
63:34 - markdown file here and as well the
63:36 - license file I'm sure that's in here as
63:38 - well the security policy as well um so
63:41 - yeah there's a lot going on in here and
63:43 - then there's all this stuff up here this
63:45 - these are features on top of your
63:47 - repo so lots and lots and lots of stuff
63:50 - if we want to see our commits we can go
63:52 - here and click on commits and this is
63:54 - kind of like a tree it doesn't give you
63:57 - the full view because when you are
63:59 - looking at um when you're looking at a
64:02 - tree uh there's branches and stuff so
64:04 - we're missing that information here but
64:06 - the idea is you can go here and uh go to
64:08 - different branches and look at those
64:10 - commits and that's basically all I
64:12 - wanted to do here we'll get into it a
64:14 - lot deeper later on but that is your
64:15 - tour of GitHub repos
64:19 - [Music]
64:23 - ciao hey this is Andrew Brown and in
64:25 - this video what I want to do is a quick
64:27 - and dirty get crash course um you are
64:31 - supposed to already have this knowledge
64:33 - uh coming into this uh certification
64:35 - even though they kind of suggest that
64:36 - you do and you don't um this is not
64:39 - going to be a complete crash course um
64:41 - it's just going to be uh the least
64:43 - amount of knowledge we need to know in
64:45 - order to be able to be productive in
64:46 - GitHub uh you really do need to make
64:49 - sure you know git very well and should
64:52 - look at other additional resources to go
64:53 - be on this little component but it'll be
64:56 - good enough uh we did create that repo
64:58 - or I created that repo earlier in exam
65:00 - Pro I think that's a great uh great
65:02 - place to start so what I'm going to do
65:05 - is I'm going to go and log into my other
65:08 - new account so over here and uh I'm
65:11 - going to go and make my way over there
65:14 - so I'm going to type in for slash exam
65:16 - proo up here I'm going to look for this
65:18 - new repo here and um the reason I'm
65:22 - doing this normally I would just open it
65:23 - in my regular account but what I want to
65:25 - do is I want to show you how to fork and
65:27 - then we're going to do some work in here
65:30 - and you'll commit it to your own repo
65:32 - but what I will do is I will end up U
65:34 - bringing those changes over into the
65:36 - original repo okay so anyway the way
65:39 - we're going to get started is um there's
65:42 - a few ways we can go ahead and open up
65:54 - a terminal but probably the easiest way
65:57 - is to open up
66:02 - github.io that's going to make a copy of
66:05 - it and have a reference to it so I'm
66:07 - going to go and click that and notice
66:09 - it'll prefill the name in make sure it
66:11 - stays the same it says copying the main
66:13 - branch only that's all there is right
66:14 - now and that's what we're going to do so
66:17 - we'll create that fork and now we have
66:20 - GitHub uh uh uh GitHub examples and
66:23 - notice under our name we have it here it
66:25 - shows that it is a fork so I want to
66:28 - open this up in
66:53 - github.com
66:54 - okay and we'll give it a moment and I
66:57 - think that we can do stuff in here if we
66:59 - can't we'll have to open up a developer
67:00 - environment like a GitHub code spaces
67:02 - but I'm hoping that we can use this
67:04 - initially because we can write commits
67:07 - in
67:08 - here so this is open and um we have our
67:12 - readme file and on the left hand side we
67:14 - have this GitHub icon so this is
67:17 - obviously an extension installed
67:18 - specifically for GitHub but if we don't
67:21 - have a terminal we're not going to be
67:23 - able to do a whole lot here so we could
67:25 - commit stuff over here and maybe we'll
67:27 - start with that and I'll just show you
67:29 - how to do it with the goey so let's go
67:31 - ahead and I'm going to make a new
67:34 - folder I'm going to call this git crash
67:38 - course okay and in here I'm going I'm
67:42 - going to name it lower case I actually
67:43 - prefer when they're lower case get crash
67:45 - course and there's a few things that we
67:47 - want to cover okay so I'm going to make
67:49 - a new file here I'm going to just say
67:52 - readme MD
67:57 - and um a couple things I want to cover
68:01 - uh commits I want to cover branches I
68:04 - want to cover
68:06 - remotes I want to cover stashing because
68:10 - I think that's really
68:12 - [Music]
68:14 - useful I guess merging is something that
68:17 - would be really important and so I think
68:19 - that's sufficient enough to begin with
68:21 - and whether we'll do this in order I'm
68:22 - not really sure but we'll start at the
68:24 - start so the first thing I want to do is
68:26 - I want to go ahead and create um a a get
68:29 - commit and we're not doing this
68:31 - programmatically we're just going to
68:33 - start out by uh doing this over here in
68:36 - the source control so Source control is
68:38 - a built-in extension in vs code that
68:40 - allows you to um uh basically write
68:45 - commit messages it's really simple so
68:47 - what I'm going to do is just right here
68:48 - and say um create skeleton readme for
68:53 - get crash course okay and so I have my
68:57 - commit message and notice that we have
68:59 - changes that are staged so changes can
69:01 - be either staged or not staged so if I
69:04 - right click this here um I can H I click
69:07 - stage changes and now it's up here so
69:09 - what's the difference between being up
69:11 - here and being down below well when I go
69:14 - ahead and click commit and push it will
69:16 - only take the stuff that is from the
69:18 - stage changes anything else will be left
69:20 - behind because sometimes you're working
69:21 - with a lot of files and you don't want
69:24 - to commit them all okay so that is the
69:26 - reason for that um but the idea is that
69:28 - you can hit minus and plus and move them
69:31 - back and forth so hopefully that is very
69:33 - clear we can click on a file we can see
69:34 - the difference and changes this is a
69:36 - completely new file that we're adding so
69:38 - we're basically having having stuff
69:41 - that's added and prior there was nothing
69:43 - so it's showing that on the left hand
69:44 - side and we are ready to do something
69:47 - with this if we drop this down we can
69:49 - have Commit push I've never clicked on
69:51 - this before so I'm not going to do that
69:53 - but I'm going to go ahead and click
69:54 - commit and push and so what it's done is
69:57 - it's committed it and it's pushed it Up
70:00 - Normally you wouldd have to perform
70:01 - those as separate actions okay but we'll
70:03 - talk about that when we start using the
70:04 - terminal so now that we have pushed that
70:06 - up what we can do is click on this
70:08 - little icon or maybe not what I'm
70:12 - looking for is a visualization for our
70:15 - um uh for our tree here it is view as
70:19 - tree and that's not helping okay so I
70:23 - guess that doesn't do what I thought it
70:25 - would do and that's totally fine so what
70:27 - we'll do
70:28 - here is we'll go back and open this up
70:31 - in uh GitHub the repo so I'm just trying
70:33 - to find if there's like a short way to
70:35 - do that no there's not so we'll have to
70:38 - go ahead and type in GitHub I'm going to
70:40 - have to type in my name uh Andrew WC
70:42 - Brown this will be GitHub examples to
70:44 - get back to this repo and we can observe
70:47 - that we've pushed that commit so if I go
70:48 - here you can see our uh get commit we
70:52 - can click into it we can you can see our
70:54 - get commit we canot comment on stuff
70:56 - here so I can say this looks
70:59 - great all
71:01 - right add a single comment and so that
71:05 - should be pretty darn clear we have a uh
71:07 - commit Shaw so that's over here um there
71:10 - should be some way to get the full Shaw
71:12 - I'm not exactly sure where it
71:15 - is uh because I can see parts of
71:18 - it a lot of times if we click into here
71:20 - it might show it here so if we go here I
71:22 - could copy that go back here I can get
71:25 - the full Shaw right okay but what I'm
71:29 - realizing is that
71:39 - github.com mans but it doesn't so that's
71:43 - okay but we can use this as a means to
71:45 - quickly edit files what I want to do is
71:47 - go ahead and close this out and we'll go
71:50 - back over to our code and what we'll do
71:53 - is we'll launch up GitHub codes spaces
71:56 - so GitHub codes spaces has a free tier
71:59 - um and that's what we'll be
72:01 - utilizing okay I'm going to try to find
72:03 - the pricing here if I
72:06 - can and I'm not exactly sure where the
72:09 - pricing is but that's totally fine we'll
72:12 - go ahead and open up a new Cod space on
72:15 - Main there's a whole section of code
72:17 - spaces in the course so we will come
72:19 - back to this and cover it in more detail
72:21 - so we'll give it a moment to launch up
72:23 - is spinning up a virtual machine
72:25 - underneath uh so that's why we have to
72:27 - wait a little bit um or if it's not
72:30 - spinning up a virtual machine it's
72:32 - spinning up a Docker container on
72:33 - existing virtual machines that's
72:34 - probably what it is and so now we get a
72:36 - terminal and that's going to allow us to
72:38 - interact um with GitHub using git
72:41 - commands so I'm going to go down to the
72:43 - bottom left corner here I'm going to
72:44 - change my theme because I cannot stand
72:46 - working in a light theme and I'm going
72:48 - to change this over to something that is
72:50 - dark um so I'm going to go to GitHub
72:53 - dark
72:54 - and so this is a little bit easier to
72:55 - read we can also increase the font here
72:57 - if this is hard to read I'm going to do
72:59 - that by going to settings and I'm just
73:01 - going to bump up the font here to 20 for
73:04 - font size and I'll do the same thing for
73:06 - terminal so I'm typing terminal in
73:09 - here and I'm looking for font size we
73:12 - can also just type in
73:15 - font sometimes it's a bit tricky to find
73:18 - terminal
73:21 - font there we go and we'll turn this up
73:23 - to 20 okay so that should be a lot
73:26 - easier to read so I can go in here I'll
73:29 - click into read me now this is going to
73:31 - come pre-installed with Git if I type in
73:32 - Git it should be here okay so I didn't
73:34 - have to do anything it's already
73:35 - installed I'm not covering how to
73:38 - install git on your local machine I'm
73:40 - going to be doing everything in the
73:41 - cloud developer environment because it's
73:43 - just easier and I don't want to uh work
73:45 - through all those challenges of trying
73:47 - to show you how to do that um so
73:49 - normally what you'll do is when you
73:51 - start working with a repo you're going
73:52 - to clone it now this repo has already
73:54 - been cloned because we opened it up but
73:56 - let's say it hadn't been let's go ahead
73:59 - and just do that ourselves so what I
74:00 - want to do is I'm going to just CD back
74:03 - a directory and type in clear and type
74:06 - in LS and we're going to see where we
74:08 - are so right now we're in workspaces
74:10 - okay I'm just going to make uh a new
74:13 - directory and just call it temp I'm
74:15 - going to CD into that and what I want to
74:17 - do here is I want to take the first step
74:20 - into bringing in this repo okay and the
74:23 - way we're going to do that is by going
74:25 - back over to here and we're going to go
74:28 - over to
74:29 - code and we're going to go to local and
74:31 - then we have these commands we have htps
74:34 - SSH and the GitHub CLI and so these are
74:36 - ways that we can bring in um our
74:41 - repo okay and so the most common way is
74:44 - by using SSH where you will actually
74:46 - have to add a public key and we can do
74:48 - that the second one is https where you'd
74:51 - have to use your personal access token
74:54 - and there's the GitHub CLI and this I
74:55 - think is probably the way we should do
74:57 - it in the future but we're just going to
74:59 - work any way we can here so what I'm
75:01 - going to do is go back over here and
75:03 - we're going to go all the way to top and
75:04 - we're going to talk about cloning okay
75:07 - so we have three ways to clone so we can
75:09 - clone three
75:12 - ways
75:13 - HPS uh
75:15 - SSH and GitHub
75:19 - CLI okay so what I'm going to do is I'm
75:21 - going to start with htps
75:24 - so we'll go over here I'm going to copy
75:26 - this and I'm going to go over here I'm
75:28 - going to type in get clone I'll write it
75:31 - in here so we can copy it out but this
75:33 - is going to be get clone and I'm going
75:35 - to paste this in okay and since we're
75:39 - working in markdown and that's part of
75:40 - the course you have to learn how
75:41 - markdown works I'm going to put three
75:43 - back ticks and put an MD
75:46 - here okay you should do all this because
75:49 - we're just learning everything up front
75:50 - if you're wondering what the the back
75:52 - tick is it is is a character that's
75:54 - above your tab key see if I can find it
75:57 - for you here back tick
76:01 - key and it's this key right here okay so
76:04 - notice that there's a back tick it's a
76:06 - tick that goes back and so that's what
76:09 - I'm pressing I'm pressing three of those
76:10 - and the reason I'm doing that is that it
76:12 - will then render that out um it's
76:14 - actually not MD It's Just sh I don't
76:16 - know why I did that and if you go up
76:18 - here in the top right corner we can
76:19 - preview all the stuff we're working on
76:21 - for our documentation but anyway this is
76:24 - the first command that I want to
76:26 - run um so I'm just going to go up here
76:29 - we'll make a
76:32 - directory uh since so we'll say since
76:34 - we're
76:35 - using we are using GitHub code
76:39 - spaces we'll
76:42 - use we'll create
76:45 - a
76:51 - temporary directory
76:54 - in our
76:55 - workspace okay and so that's what we
76:58 - did so that's going to
77:01 - be sh stands for bash I mean it's not
77:04 - exact it's shell or whatever but it's
77:06 - pretty close to it and so what we did
77:07 - there is we typed in mkd slw workpace
77:11 - TMP and then we're doing CD workspace
77:14 - TMP okay and then the next thing we want
77:16 - to do is clone this uh repo so I'm going
77:19 - to go ahead and attempt
77:20 - that so it really matters whether the
77:23 - repo is public or private if it is
77:25 - public then we don't need any
77:27 - credentials to clone it but when we want
77:30 - to push it back up that's a different
77:32 - story so I'm just trying to copy that
77:34 - this is a bit finicky the the copy paste
77:35 - here control command V uh and it's not
77:39 - letting me paste it I'm going to try
77:40 - this again
77:42 - copy there we go right click paste for
77:44 - whatever reason from here to here it
77:45 - didn't work so I'm going to go ahead and
77:46 - hit enter and so I'm actually cloning
77:49 - from here now now we have this this is
77:51 - attached um to that other location so
77:54 - just ignore this for now we're going to
77:55 - pretend this doesn't exist and we're
77:58 - just going to strictly use the git
78:00 - commands to do everything so we've
78:02 - cloned this and I'm just type in clear
78:05 - and what I want you to do is type in LS
78:07 - hyphen La so what LS hyphen La does is
78:10 - it will show you all the hidden
78:11 - directory or hidden
78:13 - folders and um we don't have any yet but
78:15 - we're going to have to CD into this
78:17 - directory I'm going go go ahead and type
78:18 - in GitHub examples
78:20 - right and um so what we'll do is just
78:22 - type
78:24 - CD GitHub
78:27 - examples and so now we're in this
78:29 - directory and I want to type in LS hyen
78:32 - LA and so I'm showing you here that
78:33 - there is a hidden folder called dog this
78:36 - is how it knows that there is a GitHub
78:39 - repo okay so I'm going to go up here for
78:41 - a second and we'll make another thing so
78:43 - we'll just say GitHub or sorry get get a
78:48 - hidden folder so there is a hidden
78:51 - folder called
78:58 - doget which tells you that uh your
79:04 - project is a git project or a git repo
79:08 - okay and normally what we would do is we
79:10 - create our git repo outside of this so
79:12 - if we wanted to we'll see you back here
79:15 - I know this is a mess but I told you
79:16 - it'd be quick and dirty is that if we
79:19 - wanted to create a new repo we could
79:20 - actually go ahead and just type in get a
79:23 - knit in a new folder so uh you know if
79:26 - we want
79:27 - to to create a get repo in a a new
79:33 - project we'd create the
79:36 - folder and then
79:40 - initialize that
79:43 - repo using get
79:45 - nit okay so what we would do
79:49 - here try and get those back ticks here
79:52 - get a n cuz we're using Code we always
79:53 - use back tiex for
79:55 - codes so what we would do here is we'd
79:57 - create a new folder so so we make we'd
79:59 - say um mkdr slw workspaces and then we
80:03 - would say temp uh new
80:06 - project and then in here we'd have uh
80:09 - that new product so we' CD CD into it so
80:12 - we just say
80:15 - workspaces temp new
80:18 - project and then we would do get a nit
80:21 - we'd create some files so we' say touch
80:23 - make a new file so you say readme.md
80:25 - then we could open that file up so I
80:27 - could say open readme.md
80:30 - then we' make some changes to
80:35 - it uh so make changes
80:39 - to readme.md then we could Commit This
80:44 - so we' say get commit hyphen M hyphen M
80:47 - hyphen a sorry hyphen a hyphen M so add
80:50 - readme
80:51 - file
80:55 - all right and so let's do a little bit
80:57 - of that right now so I'm going to say
80:58 - mkd I'm going to say new project okay
81:02 - and then I'm going to go get a nit it
81:04 - initializes a new git repo we end up
81:07 - with this
81:08 - dogit uh folder here
81:10 - okay and then we could touch a new file
81:13 - so we say readme.md
81:15 - and then if I want to open that up I
81:17 - probably can type in open. MD I would
81:19 - imagine that it would open up in here it
81:20 - didn't what if I type in vs C vsvs code
81:24 - readme.md
81:27 - no how do you open files in vs code from
81:33 - terminal I thought it was just
81:37 - open terminal
81:41 - command what is
81:46 - it there must be like a
81:48 - command code I think we type code that's
81:51 - what it is code
81:55 - okay I us usually use Vim so this is not
81:58 - my
82:00 - primary editor so we open that up and I
82:02 - can say hello
82:06 - world okay we'll save
82:09 - that I'll type in clear here and now
82:13 - what we can do is we can type in get
82:15 - status so we can see what's going on
82:17 - here so we'll say get status to see what
82:21 - files are being tracked or untracked
82:24 - this is the exact same thing as this
82:27 - thing here when you're typing get status
82:29 - this is what this is right here that's
82:30 - your get status okay so we have files
82:32 - that are are tracked but nothing's
82:34 - change uh uh stage so we can do get add
82:38 - all okay I guess I missed that there get
82:42 - at all take this part out here because
82:45 - we don't need it and um it says you've
82:48 - added another git repo inside your
82:49 - current repo we'll just ignore this
82:51 - because it it's it's just confused
82:53 - because we have that other repo we'll
82:55 - type in get status and notice now these
82:57 - are changes to be committed okay so the
83:01 - idea is that these are going to be the
83:03 - things that get pushed let's say we
83:04 - didn't want to add in GitHub examples we
83:07 - definitely don't want to do that so I'm
83:08 - going to say git remove GitHub
83:12 - examples get status didn't really work
83:16 - that's okay um we can say sorry get I
83:19 - didn't mean to do remove I meant to say
83:20 - get um
83:26 - uh um Ty
83:29 - reset sorry get
83:32 - reset get
83:34 - status there we go so reset will'll put
83:36 - them back in here I actually only wanted
83:37 - to add that say get add readme.md okay
83:41 - so we go down
83:43 - here you'll say
83:45 - get add
83:48 - readme.md and while we're on it I'm
83:50 - gonna have to go and just say
83:54 - um
83:55 - reset get reset
83:58 - so reset allows you
84:01 - to um move
84:04 - changed files back to untracked files or
84:09 - un like change or
84:11 - sorry
84:13 - staged staged changes to be
84:18 - unstaged
84:20 - okay this is useful
84:24 - when you don't want to uh you want to
84:27 - when you want
84:28 - to
84:30 - revert All Stage change all
84:34 - files not to be
84:37 - committed sorry I know it's a bit messy
84:39 - but the idea here is that we're going to
84:41 - go
84:43 - here and we'll just say get add all get
84:47 - reset so I'm going to go here and just
84:49 - say
84:51 - uh
84:53 - G reset will revert a git at all
84:58 - okay we have
85:03 - ADD so this
85:06 - is get add readme.md
85:11 - get
85:13 - ad
85:15 - when we want to
85:18 - Stage changes that will be included in
85:23 - the commit we can use the period to add
85:27 - all possible
85:30 - files all right we have get
85:35 - status get status shows you what files
85:40 - will or will not be
85:44 - committed okay let's get
85:47 - status all
85:51 - right
85:53 - so I want to type in get status again
85:55 - here okay so this is what we want to
85:58 - commit so we'll go back up to our commit
86:02 - section here and
86:05 - um yeah over here which we were kind of
86:08 - working on it and we we'll go ahead and
86:09 - type in get
86:11 - commit okay so if we just type in get
86:13 - commit it's going to try to open up the
86:16 - editor so it actually opens up here so
86:20 - what I want to do is just comment
86:21 - something here
86:25 - so get
86:29 - commit when we want to
86:33 - commit code we write we can uh write get
86:39 - commit which will open
86:43 - up
86:45 - um the
86:48 - commit edit message in the
86:54 - editor of choice and so this is already
86:57 - configured to open up in vs code if
86:59 - you're running this in your local
87:00 - machine it would complain and say Hey
87:02 - you have to set a default okay so get
87:06 - config set default
87:11 - editor okay so if we had to do that I'm
87:13 - just going to look this up really
87:14 - quickly
87:17 - here
87:19 - editor normally you'd have to set it
87:23 - right so you'd have to first set
87:25 - that
87:31 - um
87:34 - okay and so this would be emac or
87:36 - whatever
87:38 - um set the global
87:41 - editor I don't know what it is for this
87:44 - um we could take a look and see what it
87:46 - is I just hit control C to get out of
87:47 - that because I really don't want to do
87:49 - that right now so let's go find where
87:51 - this is actually configured
87:53 - um so I believe that there is like a
87:55 - global get folder somewhere it's not
87:59 - there yeah I'm not sure where it
88:02 - is let we type in get config can we see
88:05 - that we type that in I just want to see
88:09 - what is being set
88:12 - for the
88:15 - editor um so I'm not exactly sure I just
88:18 - want to know what it is so uh you know
88:21 - get uh editor vs code default I just
88:27 - want to know what that value needs to
88:30 - be
88:32 - um so that would be set as
88:39 - what oh it's dog config that's the file
88:41 - we're looking for okay hold on so this
88:44 - would probably be
88:46 - in our home folder let's try this again
88:49 - so let's say code get git config where's
88:53 - git config stored where is git
88:59 - config
89:04 - stored
89:07 - um oh we just list it out
89:12 - okay let's see if that
89:18 - works okay um we'll go down here for a
89:21 - second
89:25 - the git config
89:28 - file is what stores your Global
89:33 - configurations uh for G such as email
89:38 - name uh editor and more
89:42 - okay so we go here and I'm just going to
89:45 - say get
89:48 - config hyphen hyen
89:50 - list
89:56 - [Music]
90:00 - uh and that's
90:02 - showing the
90:04 - contents of our
90:07 - git config file still don't know where
90:10 - that file
90:13 - is but at least we
90:15 - know what some things are set at and so
90:18 - what I'm looking for in here is that
90:20 - editor
90:22 - and it's not showing up so what I'm
90:24 - thinking is that it already
90:26 - knows what to do but it is setting our
90:28 - user. name and user. email this is
90:31 - something that you would normally have
90:32 - to set so I can go back to just get
90:36 - config here and customize and get and
90:38 - notice these are the first two things
90:39 - that they set right so
90:43 - um when you first install get on a
90:47 - machine you are supposed to set up your
90:50 - name and email
90:53 - okay and so those are the examples
91:00 - there all
91:02 - right so they're right here and you can
91:05 - see that they already set it for us but
91:07 - normally you'd also have to set the
91:09 - editor and it would complain but for
91:11 - whatever reason it knows to open it up
91:13 - already in uh envious code here so I'm
91:17 - going to go back up to here and so
91:18 - that's going to open this up
91:19 - interactively so I'm going to type in
91:20 - get commit whoops
91:22 - editor down below here I'm going to type
91:24 - in um first I want to make sure I'm in
91:27 - that that folder that new
91:30 - project oh you know what I created that
91:32 - read me in the wrong
91:33 - spot let's go back here for a second
91:35 - type in LS hyphen
91:37 - LA and yeah I didn't even make it in the
91:39 - right place so remove that folder we're
91:42 - going to remove the readme
91:44 - file new project I'm going to type in
91:48 - clear and I'm going to try this again so
91:50 - we'll type in m mkd or sorry just touch
91:54 - touch readme.md
91:56 - we'll open up this file so code read MD
92:01 - we just
92:02 - say hello world save that we'll close
92:05 - that and now we will type in get status
92:08 - there is no get repost we'll type in get
92:11 - AIT and then it's initialized an empty
92:14 - repost that's good we'll type in clear
92:16 - and then we will type in get status and
92:19 - now it's not complaining about that it
92:21 - us or that um GitHub examples because
92:23 - this is now in a subfolder so it's not
92:25 - trying to add a sub module so now we can
92:27 - do get add all we can do get
92:30 - status and now this file will be added
92:34 - and we'll do get commit which will open
92:36 - it up in here and so now we can write
92:38 - our message so let's just say add readme
92:42 - file okay I'm going to save that and
92:45 - close it okay so now it completed it
92:48 - it's created it if I type in get status
92:50 - you'll see it's gone
92:52 - and so if I want to see the tree for
92:54 - this I think I can type in
92:56 - get uh was it get log and it's going to
92:59 - show me uh that commit there so if I
93:02 - added another one it should show
93:03 - multiple commits here so let's let's go
93:05 - ahead and and modify that readme file
93:08 - again so I'm going just open it up again
93:12 - here uh code readme and what I'm going
93:15 - to do I'm just going to take this other
93:16 - Tab out of the way and open a new tab
93:18 - and have it over here so we can make
93:20 - sense of what we're doing I'm going to
93:22 - put another exclamation mark so another
93:24 - way that we can commit is in line is by
93:28 - putting the m flag so I'm going to type
93:29 - in get
93:31 - status and then uh what I want to do is
93:33 - add that file okay and type in get
93:35 - status again and now I want to commit
93:38 - that change this this part here and so
93:41 - what we can do is type in get commit and
93:43 - now we'll type in hyphen M and I'll just
93:46 - say add another exclamation
93:50 - mark
93:54 - all right and don't worry about the
93:56 - spelling I do not care and I'm really
93:58 - bad at
94:00 - spelling and here we'll type in get
94:02 - commit hyphen M add
94:05 - another
94:07 - exclamation okay so uh make a commit and
94:12 - commit message without
94:16 - opening at
94:18 - editor and so what we'll do is go ahead
94:21 - and hit
94:22 - enter and so that added there we'll go
94:24 - ahead and type in get status we'll do
94:27 - get log to see stuff so we'll go here
94:32 - and say log so get log
94:37 - will show recent git commits to the git
94:42 - tree um if we want to see more of the
94:44 - tree I don't know what command it is
94:46 - like is there git tree I always forget
94:48 - and the reason I don't remember is
94:50 - because often you're relying on these
94:53 - tools so there's some stuff you should
94:54 - know here and there's some stuff you
94:56 - should just utilize in here but you
94:59 - should know the basis of get commit
95:02 - commands Okay so that's good so we
95:05 - learned about get commit status a few
95:07 - other
95:08 - things okay and so if we wanted to take
95:11 - this project and push it up uh to GitHub
95:14 - it's not going to it shouldn't work
95:16 - because we don't have credentials but
95:17 - technically this account uh or this
95:20 - environment is actually
95:21 - um tied um to GitHub so it actually
95:25 - might work um how it would work I don't
95:27 - know maybe we add our personal access
95:29 - token um but we could just find out by
95:32 - trying to push so what I'll do let go
95:35 - down here
95:36 - below and type in uh push so uh when we
95:40 - want
95:42 - to push a repo
95:46 - to um our remote
95:49 - origin and so this is so just be
95:52 - simply get push this should not work
95:55 - because we don't have a repo to push
95:57 - to okay and so we have to add a remote
96:00 - um so we can do get remote add origin
96:02 - and then put the name there but we
96:04 - haven't created a repo so there's
96:06 - nothing for it to go to so even if we
96:07 - added a remote it's not going to work
96:10 - okay so this project here is done so I'm
96:14 - going to go ahead and just clean this up
96:16 - and we'll just go ahead and type in
96:17 - remove RF new project so that's going to
96:20 - give you some ideas what you can do
96:22 - there so what I want to do is LS and I
96:24 - want to go back into this one because
96:25 - this
96:26 - one
96:29 - has um
96:31 - sorry a get folder and let's just open
96:33 - that up really quickly so we can take a
96:35 - look at what's in there so we open this
96:37 - up I typed in code it opened it up in a
96:40 - new repo I'm not really sure why try
96:43 - this again code.
96:45 - git I don't know why it's opening up in
96:47 - a new repo
96:50 - there I guess it's
96:53 - confused um but it did work the only
96:56 - problem with this is that it's opened up
96:57 - another developer environment so in here
97:00 - this is all the files that are in this
97:02 - why couldn't do it over here I don't
97:03 - know but um if we just take a look here
97:06 - uh closely we have the config folder and
97:09 - this is what I showed you earlier in
97:11 - those slides this is how it knows what
97:12 - the origin is this is how it knows how
97:15 - to push to main we have some core
97:17 - configurations here and there's some
97:20 - other stuff like we have reference and
97:22 - stuff like that I don't really want to
97:23 - get into all this stuff um because it's
97:26 - just too much but uh the most important
97:29 - thing to know is this config file
97:30 - because that's where these things are
97:32 - and so if you ever get this stuff mucked
97:33 - up like your remote or origins or
97:35 - something's not working you can fiddle
97:36 - with stuff in here um and that's all I
97:38 - wanted to point out here so I want to
97:39 - just stop this um this one here so I'm
97:42 - just going to go ahead and close this
97:45 - out there's some way to shut this one
97:46 - down I'm just going to close it out and
97:48 - should stop it with with GitHub code
97:50 - spaces you you got to really be aware of
97:53 - all the ones you're running because then
97:54 - you can run through your free hours very
97:55 - quickly so I'm going to just see what's
97:58 - running I'm going to see if I can just
97:59 - type in code spaces up here there we go
98:01 - I just want to make sure that I'm only
98:02 - running
98:03 - one okay it looks like I'm just running
98:06 - one so I think all it did was it opened
98:07 - the same uh running environment in
98:10 - another tab because it got confused
98:12 - which is totally fine but anyway this
98:14 - file is now gone and let's focus on this
98:17 - one so we created this repo here and
98:20 - technically
98:21 - we should not be able uh to push up to
98:25 - it now we might be able to because it
98:26 - might be storing our personal access
98:28 - token or some credentials but in uh
98:31 - technically it should not work so what
98:33 - I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead
98:35 - and try to add a file to this
98:38 - repo
98:40 - okay sorry I don't want to lose this one
98:43 - um and see what happens when we try to
98:45 - push okay so uh what we're going to do
98:48 - make sure we're in this repo we're going
98:50 - to type in touch readme.md and then I
98:53 - want to open this one up so I'm going to
98:54 - type in this here I'm going to say
98:58 - hello world we'll save that and the idea
99:04 - is that this is the same repo as that
99:06 - other one so actually we just um we just
99:09 - technically edited this one so you know
99:12 - what I actually don't want to make this
99:13 - file here because I realized that's
99:14 - going to causes a problem uh what I'm
99:17 - going to do I'm just going to LS here
99:18 - I'm going to CD in to get crash course
99:20 - and I'm going to make a new file here
99:21 - we'll just call it
99:22 - um
99:24 - uh hello so just say touch
99:27 - hello okay and then we'll open up this
99:30 - file
99:31 - here oh sorry code and then we'll say
99:36 - hello all right so it's not here because
99:38 - of course we're ignoring
99:40 - this okay but if we type in LS Ty and La
99:43 - we have this hello file right and so if
99:45 - I type in get
99:47 - status I can see that this file is
99:49 - untracked so I want to add it and do get
99:53 - status type in clear and now I'm going
99:56 - to do a get push so this should fail but
99:59 - it still might work let's see what
100:00 - happens it says everything's up to date
100:02 - and the reason why is that we didn't
100:04 - create a commit right if we do get
100:07 - log you notice we don't have anything
100:09 - this is the last one we ran so I'm going
100:11 - to do get commit hyphen M add hello
100:15 - file
100:17 - okay and now I'm going to do get logs so
100:21 - I can see that it's there right and now
100:24 - I'll do a get
100:25 - push and it did work so it probably
100:28 - worked
100:29 - because this environment already has the
100:32 - stuff loaded up if I was using my local
100:34 - developer environment this should not
100:36 - work um and I suppose I could show that
100:41 - I'm just trying to decide whether I want
100:42 - to do that or
100:44 - not
100:47 - um give me a second to think about it
100:50 - yeah I think I really should show you
100:52 - this so what I'll do is I'll open up vs
100:53 - code on my local
100:55 - computer and we'll do that
100:57 - okay so my point is is that even if
101:00 - you're not doing this I just want you to
101:02 - watch and understand what you'd have to
101:04 - do if you're using your local developer
101:05 - environment the trick with local
101:07 - developer environments is they're really
101:08 - finicky because um especially on Windows
101:11 - because you have to get Linux installed
101:13 - and you need the windows subsystem Linux
101:16 - and that's such a pain to work with so
101:19 - I'm here in vs code this is on my local
101:22 - computer and what I want to do is I want
101:25 - to uh bring down that repo um and so
101:29 - what I'm going to do is just open up
101:32 - terminal okay if I can find it any day
101:36 - now here it is um and I need to store
101:40 - this somewhere it's opening up in
101:41 - Powershell but I want to use Windows
101:44 - subsystem
101:45 - Linux
101:49 - okay
101:54 - and I'll give it a moment here and so
101:56 - it's it's starting up
102:00 - Linux and so here it's on my desktop in
102:03 - a folder called
102:04 - code okay I'm just going to type in
102:06 - LS not sure what this
102:09 - is but I normally like storing things in
102:12 - a folder called sites so I already have
102:14 - one here and the idea is I want to um I
102:17 - want to clone that repo into here so
102:20 - what I'm going to do just bring this
102:21 - over here for a
102:22 - second all right so this one was uh this
102:25 - was this one was no good I couldn't
102:27 - really show you this example here so I'm
102:29 - just going to go ahead and
102:30 - [Music]
102:31 - remove this
102:36 - one and we'll just get this back to
102:39 - normal okay type in that clear and I'm
102:41 - going to go back over to here into our G
102:45 - GitHub crash course so we can keep
102:46 - working on
102:48 - this and I want to go back up to commits
102:52 - or sorry cloning and I want to go ahead
102:54 - and attempt this clone uh that we're
102:57 - doing earlier so this is mine right of
102:58 - course you'll have to switch this out
102:59 - for yours so understand you can't just
103:01 - copy and paste this you have to modify
103:04 - it but I'm going to copy this I'm going
103:06 - to go over here and in my Linux system
103:09 - I'm going to go ahead and paste this in
103:11 - because I think I already have get
103:12 - installed right and it's downloading it
103:14 - here okay so I've downloaded it because
103:16 - it's a public repo but the question is
103:18 - can I push to it so I want to open this
103:20 - project up here in vs code I'm going to
103:22 - go ahead and type in code
103:24 - period and that should reopen vs codes
103:28 - in this context I'll get rid of this old
103:29 - one here out of the way that was some
103:32 - other thing I was working on I'm going
103:34 - to say I trust the authors it's totally
103:36 - fine and apparently there's a newer vs
103:38 - code I do not
103:40 - care and it's opened up this entire
103:42 - directory so I kind of messed that
103:44 - up and I'm G to go into terminal again
103:47 - so sorry you can see I have a bunch of
103:49 - stuff in here
103:51 - I'm going to CD into this by typing in
103:54 - um GitHub examples and we'll try this
103:57 - again I'll type in code period and then
103:59 - I'll close this one all right and then
104:01 - this time we now have our local
104:04 - developer environment in good shape okay
104:07 - so just understand that you can connect
104:10 - GitHub codes spaces to your local one I
104:13 - don't want to do that I because I want
104:15 - this to be detached from git so I can
104:16 - show you the challenges of cloning so
104:19 - this has been cloned already we already
104:21 - did that and if I go over into terminal
104:26 - here okay new terminal and I want to
104:29 - make sure I'm
104:31 - in uh WSL which I am I'm going to type
104:35 - in lsy La I want to see that I have that
104:37 - dog directory here and we're going to go
104:39 - ahead and modify this hello file I'm
104:42 - going to put an exclamation mark I'm
104:43 - going to hit save and so the idea is I'm
104:45 - going to do get push and I'm expecting
104:48 - it not to work so it says it doesn't
104:50 - work work would you like to sign in with
104:52 - GitHub no I don't want to sign in with
104:54 - GitHub even though that's awesome I
104:56 - don't want to do that and the reason why
104:58 - is because I want to show you how you
105:01 - would use a personal access token so
105:04 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
105:06 - over here bring this down and I go back
105:08 - to GitHub and we're going to go over to
105:10 - here and we're going to go to settings
105:12 - and then all the way down to the ground
105:14 - we're going to go to developer settings
105:16 - and we're going to click into personal
105:18 - access tokens and we have a fine grin
105:19 - access tokens
105:21 - you don't need to use access tokens very
105:23 - often this is just for this specific use
105:25 - case we're going to go ahead and
105:27 - generate this token I'm going to say um
105:30 - temporary
105:32 - token uh local Dev and I want this to
105:37 - expire uh in the least amount of time so
105:40 - today is Sunday I'm going to say
105:42 - tomorrow uh this token is just for today
105:47 - and I want this for a very specific repo
105:50 - so you can say say all repos we're going
105:51 - to say a select repo I'm going to go
105:54 - here and select my one
105:56 - repo and for repository
105:59 - permissions
106:01 - um I just want to be able to push this
106:03 - and work with it count
106:06 - permissions so I just have to make sure
106:08 - I give this proper
106:10 - permissions um PLL requests merges
106:16 - issues
106:18 - um I'm trying to give it permissions to
106:21 - just push
106:23 - code
106:25 - push
106:29 - commit so I think we definitely want
106:31 - this read and write want commit statuses
106:34 - read and
106:35 - write and I think that should be
106:38 - sufficient I'd probably put poll
106:40 - requests in here as well before GitHub
106:43 - used to just have like you'd make a
106:44 - classic token you wouldn't have to do
106:46 - all this but they're trying to make it
106:47 - more secure so that's how it is uh
106:51 - um and so I think this is sufficient so
106:53 - I go ahead and create this
106:55 - token and so I now have this token so
106:58 - the idea is that um when I'm over
107:01 - here normally this would prompt us it
107:03 - wouldn't do this oh yeah we have the
107:04 - username up here so it's asking us to
107:06 - enter our username in here normally this
107:08 - would prompt down here but it's not so
107:09 - I'm just going to hit
107:11 - clear okay and I'm going to try try this
107:13 - again say get push I'm saying cancel and
107:16 - so it's prompting up here if you're not
107:17 - using vs code it would normally show up
107:19 - here so I'm going to type in my username
107:21 - like this and now it's asking for a
107:24 - password and before you could put your
107:26 - actual password in here you can't do
107:27 - that anymore you have to use this
107:29 - personal access token so if I got those
107:31 - permissions right this should work okay
107:34 - so I'm going to paste that in hit
107:36 - enter and so now it says everything up
107:39 - to date so did it
107:42 - push that's what I want to know so we'll
107:45 - go back over to here um and if we click
107:47 - here we can go um um oh sorry down here
107:50 - I'm looking for how to find this
107:52 - repo there was a button here
107:55 - before why can't I find it maybe it's
107:58 - over here
108:01 - no that's fine but we want to go ahead
108:04 - and look at that repo so I'm going to go
108:06 - and type in Andrew WC
108:10 - Brown and I want to look at our only
108:12 - repo that we have and I want to see if
108:15 - those commits work so if I click in
108:18 - here we have ADD hello
108:21 - file and that didn't do anything so
108:23 - maybe it's because we didn't add
108:24 - anything let's go get status here get
108:28 - status we have to add it if we want it
108:30 - to work right we say get commit
108:33 - update and then I'm going to type in get
108:36 - push and so it's trying to log in so
108:38 - every single time we want to push it's
108:41 - going to ask us for that because it
108:42 - doesn't remember what it is we can
108:44 - technically cach those credentials um
108:47 - I'm not sure what the flag is I've never
108:49 - had to ever have have to to do it but
108:51 - there is some way to Cache it we're
108:52 - going to just hit cancel because I just
108:54 - want to show you how to use that
108:56 - personal access token
109:00 - okay and uh then I'll go go back there
109:03 - and grab that I think we still have it
109:05 - there
109:06 - good okay I'm going to go back to our
109:11 - local vs code I'm going to paste this in
109:15 - hit enter and so now it pushes
109:18 - okay so it's pushed it there
109:21 - and so that's one one example of us
109:24 - doing that okay we'll just confirm that
109:27 - it's there we can see it right there so
109:29 - that's one method of cloning so go back
109:32 - over to here to our uh
109:36 - documentation in GitHub code
109:39 - spaces so here we'll just say uh you'll
109:42 - need
109:43 - to um
109:48 - so you'll need need to generate a
109:52 - GitHub access
110:00 - token or sorry personal access
110:09 - token and we'll go grab that link so we
110:12 - know where that is so it's right
110:15 - here okay says this it's a beta feature
110:18 - but I can't imagine they'll revert that
110:24 - you will use the pat as your password
110:28 - when you log
110:29 - in
110:31 - uh and the permissions we you know give
110:40 - it I think we need that all right so
110:44 - that's one way another way is with
110:49 - SSH okay so what we'll
110:52 - do is I want to get rid of this token
110:56 - because I don't need it anymore I'm just
110:57 - going to go ahead and delete
110:59 - that and I want to go back to our repo
111:02 - which is over here and we want to clone
111:06 - this VI the
111:07 - SSH and because I can't trust GitHub
111:11 - because I think it's uh the GitHub code
111:13 - spaces it already has our credential
111:15 - somewhere we're going to have to do it
111:16 - this way so I want to CD back here I'm
111:18 - going to remove this directory
111:21 - okay clear and I want to clone it again
111:23 - and so this time I'm going to grab the
111:25 - SSH if we go over
111:28 - here we'll paste this link in
111:31 - here and it looks really similar but
111:34 - this is not the same
111:40 - link
111:42 - SSH okay and we'll want to CD into that
111:46 - so the difference here is that look at
111:47 - this this says htps is the protocol this
111:49 - one puts the stuff in the front so it's
111:51 - a different
111:52 - protocol um and and URL for cloning so
111:56 - we go ahead and copy this and we'll go
111:58 - down below I'm going to paste this in
112:00 - and hit
112:01 - enter okay so it can clone because it's
112:03 - a public repo if this is a private repo
112:06 - we would have to already have our
112:07 - credential set I'm going to go ahead and
112:10 - um close this out and we want to reopen
112:14 - this so it should know this is the same
112:17 - thing but because we deleted that repo
112:18 - it's confused so I'm going to go into
112:20 - GitHub examples and I'm going to reopen
112:22 - this up in vs code it'll open up a new
112:27 - window not sure what's taking it so
112:32 - long okay it just autod detected it so I
112:34 - guess it didn't have to do that it's
112:35 - fine but um we'll open this file up
112:38 - again and I'm going to put an
112:39 - exclamation mark on the end and so I'm
112:42 - going to do get
112:44 - status right again we can do it over
112:47 - here we refresh it
112:50 - but I'd rather do it from here so that's
112:52 - not there I'm going to say get add read
112:55 - me or period now let's refresh it notice
112:59 - it moved to Stage changes and then we
113:01 - can do get commit hyphen
113:05 - M update SSH
113:08 - way all right and it
113:12 - pushed um how did it do
113:16 - that because it's not supposed to work
113:20 - um so it makes me think that that
113:22 - personal access token is still
113:24 - there
113:26 - okay oh no no no no no no it it didn't
113:29 - push it didn't push the reason I'm
113:30 - confused is that notice that this said
113:32 - push so when we go here this will let us
113:35 - commit and push sometimes but we've only
113:37 - just committed it locally okay so if I
113:39 - type in get
113:41 - status all right it's here
113:44 - okay it's not um it's not it's not
113:48 - remotely there okay
113:50 - so in order to actually get it get it up
113:53 - we have to type and get push so that's a
113:54 - separate action so we'll go ahead and
113:55 - type in get push so now it should
113:58 - complain so this says rejected um and
114:01 - the reason why it's rejected is because
114:02 - we don't have an SSH key so what we'll
114:04 - need to do is generate out an SSH key
114:07 - and the way we do that is we type in SSH
114:09 - key gen hyphen T I believe it is and we
114:12 - type in RSA to be specifically what it's
114:14 - for we even say the length of it this is
114:17 - a Linux command uh mode Linux
114:20 - distributions should have this
114:22 - pre-installed so you can definitely do
114:23 - it the place that you would put this key
114:27 - would be in a very specific location so
114:29 - I already have a default one and I'm
114:31 - going to rename it to something else but
114:32 - you can leave it as a default if you
114:34 - want if you've never ran this command in
114:35 - your life I'm going to go ahead and hit
114:38 - enter oh you know what it's key gen SSH
114:41 - or key
114:42 - gen SSH
114:44 - keyen I forgot what it is
114:48 - already keyen
114:50 - SSH it's SSH key gen okay so go back
114:55 - here I'm Type in SSH key gen TR
115:00 - RSA okay and it's saying where do you
115:02 - want to create it it will usually create
115:04 - it here I want this to be named a little
115:07 - bit different I'm just going to say um
115:10 - GitHub
115:12 - alt and then I'm going to say ID
115:16 - RSA
115:18 - okay
115:21 - and then I'm going to hit enter for no
115:23 - passphrase a passphrase passphrase is a
115:26 - way to password protect it I don't want
115:27 - to do that you don't always have to do
115:29 - that um but it makes it more secure
115:31 - notice that it generated up both the
115:34 - private key and the public key we're
115:35 - going to talk about key pairs later in
115:37 - the course I made sure to cover this
115:39 - they didn't make it a requirement in the
115:41 - in the uh uh the uh the guide or the uh
115:44 - the C the certification course but I
115:47 - know you need to know this so I made
115:48 - sure to put that in in there so we've
115:50 - generated out this uh private private
115:53 - and public secret and they're located
115:55 - here so we're going to need to get the
115:56 - contents of this one and send it over um
115:59 - to to GitHub so the way we can do that
116:02 - is we can just grab this URL or write
116:05 - this out and and Cat it out so cat is a
116:07 - way in Linux to print out to the
116:10 - terminal and so I'm going to type this
116:11 - full path I'm hitting tab to quickly
116:14 - complete uh this so I don't have to
116:16 - write it all out by hand and I'm looking
116:18 - for GitHub
116:20 - GitHub
116:22 - alt ID
116:24 - RSA it's kind of not showing me all the
116:26 - files I'm going to just go ahead and
116:27 - type this here for a
116:30 - second
116:31 - okay and um weird it's not there so it
116:36 - says TS RSA enter the file in which to
116:39 - save it oh it didn't actually save it
116:42 - here did it save it over here it did all
116:45 - right I don't want it here I'll try this
116:48 - again so we'll hit up because it wants
116:51 - the full path that's why um and so we'll
116:53 - do this again we'll say home Andrew
116:58 - SSH I'm going to say uh alt
117:04 - GitHub
117:05 - ID
117:07 - RSA enter enter enter so now it's where
117:10 - we think it is so it's actually here I'm
117:12 - going to copy
117:14 - this and we'll type in cat and we'll
117:16 - paste this in that's going to give us
117:18 - this funky looking thing so this is the
117:20 - contents of the public key and I I need
117:22 - to copy that so I'm going to just do
117:23 - this and write copy I I did contrl C
117:26 - because I couldn't rightclick
117:28 - it um and I'm going to go back up to
117:30 - here and then in GitHub we got to add
117:32 - that to our account so I'll go to
117:36 - settings and I'll go over to SSH and I'm
117:41 - going to add a new SSH key I'm just
117:44 - going to say paste this in here I'll
117:46 - just say uh
117:48 - local uh environment you might even say
117:50 - what computer this is from you might
117:51 - have multiple computers with local
117:53 - developer environments so I'm on my my
117:56 - my Windows machine so Windows local and
117:59 - you know we have two things here I
118:00 - believe it's an authentication key and
118:02 - we'll put that in there so this should
118:05 - allow
118:06 - us uh to now push okay because it will
118:10 - it will match the private and public key
118:11 - out I explained in the course how it
118:13 - works like the logic behind it but this
118:16 - should work assuming I set it right so
118:18 - what I'll do is I'll type in get status
118:21 - because we should have something ready
118:23 - to push right so notice it says here
118:25 - your your branch is ahead of origin by
118:28 - one commit so we have one commit that
118:29 - hasn't been pushed yet we'll go ahead
118:31 - and hit get push and if we did it
118:33 - correctly it should work and so I did
118:35 - something wrong um what I did wrong I'm
118:38 - not 100%
118:40 - sure um so we can try that again so I'm
118:44 - going to go ahead and go back up here
118:47 - because this format might matter it
118:48 - might be in the the wrong format but I'm
118:50 - pretty
118:51 - sure it should just be
118:54 - this give this a refresh
118:57 - here um says never used I'll try this
119:00 - one more time maybe takes time sometimes
119:04 - it's VY like that nope so if it didn't
119:08 - like
119:10 - that I'll try signing I don't remember
119:12 - there being to key types before so I'm a
119:14 - little bit confused myself and I don't
119:16 - remember this stuff off the top of my
119:17 - head if we copy this wrong that could be
119:19 - the issue as well but we really want to
119:22 - copy the public key okay notice it says
119:25 - begins with R RS or that okay so I'll
119:29 - paste this
119:31 - in it's definitely the right format so
119:33 - I'm not sure why it doesn't like it
119:35 - Windows local we'll try this
119:39 - again
119:40 - okay and we'll go back over to our local
119:44 - environment and we'll say get
119:48 - push still doesn't work yeah I don't
119:50 - think it's the signing key we'll try
119:52 - this one more
119:54 - time
119:57 - new
119:59 - paste
120:01 - and like that doesn't seem like that's
120:03 - the problem right maybe it's supposed to
120:06 - have a space let's go back and take a
120:08 - look at uh vs
120:13 - code this has a space in between it
120:17 - okay this has a space
120:24 - okay so SSH key
120:27 - gen key not
120:29 - working
120:32 - GitHub it's not uncommon to have issues
120:35 - like it just happens to me
120:38 - sometimes
120:44 - um sometimes we can test it
120:47 - out we don't have to set the origin
120:50 - because we cloned it
120:53 - e that should be fine I'm not really
120:55 - worried about
120:58 - that um
121:00 - SSH key
121:02 - gen GitHub because maybe they might tell
121:04 - us like it give us an example and then
121:07 - um maybe I entered it in wrong maybe it
121:08 - wants it in a very particular
121:15 - format because it can be finicky give me
121:17 - just a second okay so not sure if we
121:19 - have to do this but maybe we need to add
121:21 - the SSH or the the key to our our SSS
121:25 - agent um I remember doing this one time
121:27 - but normally it usually picks up
121:28 - anything that's in that directory so I'm
121:30 - actually kind of surprised but if that's
121:32 - the case let's go ahead and just
121:34 - explicitly set it so let's give that a
121:36 - go and um so we'll just hit up here and
121:40 - I'm just going to go ahead and type in
121:41 - SSH
121:43 - add
121:46 - and add your SSH private key
121:50 - okay and that's just RSA there like
121:53 - that put
121:55 - enter could not open a connection to
121:58 - your authentication
121:59 - agent just a
122:01 - second um it's suggesting you run this
122:03 - line again I'm kind of getting the
122:04 - territory of like doing anything which I
122:07 - don't really like the SSH program runs
122:09 - in the back room to hold your private
122:10 - Keys keeps them ready use by SSH okay
122:13 - well let's try this um and again this is
122:16 - why I don't like showing local
122:18 - development because it's so finicky it's
122:20 - a lot easier on a Mac but I can't share
122:23 - my screen on a Mac so I mean you could
122:25 - but I I it's very difficult for me to do
122:27 - so so now we've added the the identity
122:30 - and I'm hoping that now this will work
122:32 - there are debug commands that you can
122:34 - use so like GitHub SSH
122:37 - debug um like here there there is like
122:41 - this you could run so attempts to
122:43 - connect to SSH to see if it works so we
122:46 - could use that and give it a test
122:49 - um go back over here right and hit
122:53 - enter hi King you successfully
122:55 - authenticated but GitHub does not
122:57 - provide shell access so that's one way
123:00 - we could test that's a good command to
123:03 - know
123:05 - um we'll go here and say put this
123:09 - here we can test our connection
123:15 - here we will need to create
123:19 - our own SSH keyy key
123:23 - pair RSA key pair so that' be SSH key
123:28 - gen TR
123:43 - RSA for uh WSL users and if you create a
123:49 - [Music]
123:51 - um you WSL users and if you create a key
123:56 - in a a
123:58 - different a if you
124:02 - create a
124:03 - non default key you might need to add it
124:08 - so that was us running that
124:12 - um like this
124:17 - here
124:22 - so that might fix that issue for us um
124:25 - this is for testing our connection so
124:27 - that's telling us that we can push okay
124:31 - and so what I want to do is go back over
124:34 - to here and let's see if we can push get
124:37 - push fingers crossed and normally what
124:41 - happens the first time you add something
124:42 - it's going to add it uh to the key ring
124:44 - usually ask us to uh say yes but it's
124:48 - still not working so I mean that might
124:50 - establish connection that we can
124:55 - reach you you successfully authenticated
124:57 - but does not provide shell access okay
125:03 - um so our keys still not working we have
125:07 - permission
125:08 - denied are we pushing to the right repo
125:11 - yeah we are it looks like we are um one
125:13 - thing we could do is check that hidden
125:14 - folder it's not showing them here
125:17 - there's some way to show hidden folders
125:18 - and get not sure why it's not showing up
125:20 - give me two seconds I've being told the
125:23 - hcky is control shift G control shift G
125:25 - if you're on a Mac it might be
125:27 - Control G that didn't work for me I
125:30 - tried
125:31 - it what is
125:34 - it command shift
125:38 - period control shift
125:42 - period nope no good so we'll just go to
125:44 - our settings and open it up hidden
125:53 - Files come on show hidden files I just
125:56 - want to see them show hidden
126:05 - files files exclude preference
126:14 - settings
126:17 - files
126:22 - um yeah so I I want to see that there we
126:25 - go so it's it's it's hiding some of them
126:27 - the reason I want to go here is check
126:28 - the config I want to make sure that
126:29 - we're going to ours because if you try
126:32 - to push to mine let's say you cloned
126:34 - mine it would not work because you can't
126:36 - push to mine you don't have permission
126:37 - to do so but I I should have permission
126:39 - to push to my own here's another
126:41 - question when I upload those keys what
126:43 - account was I in okay I'm in the correct
126:45 - account so this is the one that I'm
126:46 - supposed to be
126:47 - in uh uh is it though because I might
126:50 - have had another tab open let's make
126:51 - sure we're 100% in the right location we
126:54 - are here I'm going to go to SSH
126:57 - Keys it's not here you think you know
126:59 - what I think I did I might have added it
127:01 - to the other account or we deleted it we
127:03 - didn't add it back in so I'm going to go
127:05 - ahead and add this
127:08 - in Windows local you really have to
127:11 - think these things through and think
127:12 - okay check check check check check all
127:14 - right and so I what I want is that SSH
127:18 - key again I think it's going to work
127:19 - this
127:21 - time
127:24 - okay uh I don't want to add it I just
127:26 - want to C it
127:29 - okay and we'll go back up here and we'll
127:32 - paste it in and we'll hit uh add the key
127:35 - and now this time I think it's going to
127:37 - work get
127:40 - push excellent okay great so that's now
127:44 - done I want to go back here I'm going to
127:46 - delete the repo again because we have
127:49 - one more way that we can do it okay and
127:52 - the last way is going to be with the
127:53 - GitHub CLI so I'm on local so I might as
127:55 - well just go ahead and install it I'm
127:57 - going to delete this key because I don't
127:59 - want to have it I want to see if it will
128:00 - work without a personal access token or
128:03 - or without SSH so that we can attempt to
128:05 - log in so what I want to do
128:08 - here is I want to install uh that and I
128:12 - believe that it would use Brew or
128:14 - whatever so type in GitHub CLI install
128:18 - we'll go
128:20 - here
128:22 - and um it's going to be different based
128:24 - on what you use so if you have home brew
128:25 - installed you can use Homebrew if it's
128:28 - Linux um it's going to be
128:30 - different um I'm looking for Ubuntu in
128:32 - particular so Debbie and Ubuntu are
128:34 - basically the same way of installing it
128:37 - and um I think that we could probably
128:39 - just do it this way so we need to do a
128:41 - pseudo app
128:44 - update I guess I have to put my password
128:46 - in here is this my password like I don't
128:47 - know yep that was my password so that's
128:49 - doing an update once that's done it will
128:51 - do the next step so I'm going to go grab
128:53 - this here we're going to go back over to
128:55 - GitHub codes spaces close this one out I
128:58 - guess we never saved it that's why it
128:59 - didn't work um and so our third way
129:02 - is GitHub
129:05 - CLI install the
129:08 - CLI
129:11 - okay EG Ubuntu for
129:16 - Linux Okay so in this particular case I
129:20 - believe this is Ubuntu and that's Ubuntu
129:22 - they're both
129:25 - Ubuntu and I'm going to grab the next
129:27 - line
129:28 - here and we'll paste that in that's
129:31 - going to install it could not locate the
129:33 - package if it couldn't locate the
129:34 - package it probably doesn't know where
129:35 - the package is so I have to go back over
129:37 - here and so this adds The Source that's
129:40 - what it wants so I'm going to just go
129:42 - grab this whole darn thing is this all
129:44 - the same command no it's not but we
129:46 - we'll grab the whole thing and this will
129:49 - actually install all of it in one
129:52 - go
129:53 - paste you can actually see that it's
129:55 - doing an update and then it's installing
129:57 - it here so I'll go back here and update
129:59 - our
130:00 - docs a bit
130:03 - messy
130:06 - okay and so once that's
130:09 - installed uh we'll have to do a couple
130:11 - things we'll have to
130:12 - do GH
130:15 - login and then we'll have to do GH clown
130:18 - and get that link we'll go grab it from
130:20 - our
130:22 - repo
130:28 - um so go here we'll go to code we'll go
130:31 - to CLI we'll grab this and we'll bring
130:34 - this on up here and I'm going to do
130:37 - GP well I want to paste that into our uh
130:41 - example
130:42 - here see GH
130:46 - clone Okay g GH
130:49 - login now we technically don't need to
130:51 - log in for uh this to
130:54 - work should be oh I think it's j off
130:57 - login that's probably why there we go
130:59 - GitHub um oh we're going to choose a
131:02 - method uh
131:05 - htps authenticate with your GitHub
131:08 - credentials yeah I thought it was going
131:10 - to just do something for us but
131:11 - apparently it's going to have to rely on
131:13 - on something like that so if that's the
131:15 - case I think what I would rather do is
131:17 - use the SSH key so I just hit control C
131:19 - to log out of that and what I'm going to
131:22 - do I'm going have to go back and put
131:24 - that that SSH key back in because we
131:26 - deleted it um it doesn't matter if you
131:29 - see mine because you don't have my you
131:30 - can't see my private key so you really
131:32 - shouldn't show anyone your public key
131:34 - but it's not going to hurt that you see
131:36 - mine um I'm going to go back over to
131:38 - here and add it again I
131:40 - guess we're going to go down to here
131:43 - we're going to add that SSH key Windows
131:47 - local
131:49 - okay and then I'm going to go back over
131:51 - to here we'll type in clear um I want to
131:55 - just update the doc so that says off
131:58 - here we'll save that we'll bring this
132:01 - back up we'll type in clear and I want
132:03 - to do GH off
132:06 - login and we'll log with GitHub we'll
132:08 - use SSH and we'll tell it which key to
132:10 - use which is pretty cool and the title
132:13 - for your SSH
132:15 - [Music]
132:17 - key well why do I need to upload it
132:19 - title for your SSH key oh it'll actually
132:21 - upload it for us oh that's cool okay
132:24 - clear it let's go back I didn't know
132:26 - could do that we'll go ahead and hit
132:29 - delete and we'll try this
132:31 - again GH login that's really cool I like
132:34 - that and we'll say SSH I also wonder if
132:36 - it would generate out your token for you
132:39 - so we'll use this one and we'll say
132:41 - windows
132:43 - local and um we'll log in with a we web
132:48 - browser first copy this onetime code
132:51 - into your browser press enter to open
132:52 - github.com your browser okay I'll hit
132:57 - enter and I'm going to log in with this
133:00 - we'll enter that code in we'll continue
133:03 - and we'll authorize it and so now we're
133:05 - logged in okay so we can now use GitHub
133:08 - to clone the the CLI and we'll go back
133:11 - over to
133:12 - here okay and we'll copy this and we'll
133:16 - go back over to here and we'll paste
133:18 - this in and we should be able to clone
133:20 - so maybe I I typed that command wrong it
133:22 - doesn't look right it looks like it's
133:23 - doubled in here I'll try this again
133:25 - we'll hit enter sorry try this
133:30 - again that's not working so I'm doing
133:32 - something wrong let's go back over to
133:34 - our docks have it in here
133:37 - double and uh oh maybe it's like GitHub
133:40 - repo clone that's probably what it
133:45 - is there we go and so we clone the
133:50 - repo all right we'll CD into that
133:54 - directory as per
133:57 - usual um we'll go in here and just say
134:02 - hello get add uh
134:05 - all get commit say GitHub C way and
134:10 - we'll say get push oops get
134:14 - push and that worked okay so that's all
134:17 - of our ways that we can do it locally
134:18 - I'm pretty much done with this I'm going
134:20 - to close it out and so we've
134:23 - learned um all the ways here so that's
134:25 - pretty sweet um this get get repo clone
134:28 - so that's good we learned about
134:31 - commits
134:32 - okay um learned about adding we haven't
134:36 - learned about branching so branching is
134:38 - pretty straightforward we're going to be
134:40 - doing a lot of branching so I don't feel
134:41 - like I have to do a lot here right now
134:44 - um but uh what we can do here is we can
134:46 - type in get Branch to get a list of
134:47 - branch
134:50 - branches say list of
134:55 - branches okay and we can go ahead and
134:57 - create ourselves a new Branch so I'm
134:59 - going to go ahead and type in get Branch
135:02 - um and then type a name so we'll say um
135:05 - Dev and I'll hit enter
135:09 - so create a new
135:16 - branch Branch
135:19 - name if I type in get Branch I can get a
135:21 - list of them okay and so I can check out
135:25 - that Branch so we'll
135:26 - say check out the
135:31 - branch get Branch I'm sorry get
135:36 - checkout
135:38 - Dev get checkout Dev and notice I'm in
135:42 - dep this highlighting stuff here will
135:44 - not be in your local terminal uh you
135:47 - might have to install something or
135:48 - additional or invs code it may or may
135:51 - not show up just understand that this is
135:52 - pre-loaded with some stuff in here um so
135:55 - we're in Dev right now we're actually in
135:56 - a different branch so I'm going to do um
136:00 - get
136:02 - um uh I want to change this file here so
136:05 - we go ahead and just change
136:07 - it uh where is it'll
136:10 - refresh oh you know the thing is is that
136:12 - we've been making changes but we haven't
136:14 - been doing them in here so if I do get
136:16 - fetch for a second
136:18 - you'll notice that origin main is
136:20 - there's more going on here than you than
136:21 - you think and so by doing fetch we can
136:23 - actually see if we're out of date or not
136:26 - um and so my issue right now is there's
136:27 - that file I don't have access to it but
136:29 - I'm going to go ahead and make it again
136:30 - I'm say hello here and I'll say uh
136:34 - Branch
136:37 - version okay and I'm going to do get
136:44 - status and so we have that there um so
136:48 - what we can do is go ahead and go get
136:50 - add all and I'll say get commit hyphen M
136:55 - uh
136:56 - changes
136:58 - okay and now what I want to do is get
137:00 - push and push that branch and right away
137:02 - you're going to notice that it's not
137:03 - going to work and the reason why is that
137:06 - Branch does not have a remote right
137:09 - that's really important because if it
137:10 - doesn't have a remote reference it's not
137:11 - going to be able to push and there is no
137:13 - branch in our GitHub repo right now if
137:15 - we go back to our repo um
137:18 - in mine is listed over here remember
137:21 - your name is different than my name so
137:22 - type
137:23 - yours GitHub examples let's go
137:27 - here into
137:29 - here um you know I have a branch here it
137:33 - should well we don't have one yet we
137:34 - haven't created one yet so that's one
137:37 - thing uh that we need to make note of
137:41 - um so the thing is and the other thing
137:44 - is like
137:46 - um have we been making these changes
137:48 - this entire time yeah we have um but
137:50 - anyway
137:53 - so yeah we have a
137:56 - branch that's that locally but we don't
137:58 - have one that exists yet and so the idea
138:00 - is that we want to we can either create
138:01 - the branch and then push to it or we can
138:04 - basically run this command and do it in
138:06 - one go okay so what I'm going to do is
138:09 - type in get push and I'm actually going
138:11 - to type in U because that's a much
138:13 - shorter version of this I'm going type
138:14 - in origin
138:15 - Dev okay and now it is tracking our Dev
138:21 - to the remote Dev if we go over here
138:23 - this Branch might exist now okay and if
138:26 - we drop down you can see Dev is there we
138:29 - haven't pushed anything into it if you
138:30 - go to commits our new commits not there
138:33 - yet right go to main you'll notice main
138:36 - is over
138:38 - here
138:40 - right um my point is is that uh we need
138:43 - to for this to work we will need to um
138:48 - uh push this change so we have this one
138:49 - file and I'm going to go ahead and say
138:52 - uh get
138:53 - status
138:55 - okay oh did we actually push it oh I
138:59 - think we accidentally pushed it so maybe
139:00 - we did make that
139:02 - change yeah we did it's over here okay
139:05 - sorry so I thought we had not pushed it
139:07 - yet but we did um now the question is
139:09 - how do we visualize this in a way that
139:11 - is easy to read and that's where we
139:13 - would have an extension normally there's
139:15 - one installed like in git pod they'll
139:17 - have pre-installed but apparently this
139:18 - one doesn't um so what we'll do is go to
139:21 - extensions we'll type in get
139:24 - tree okay because I want to be able to
139:26 - see what we're doing and there's G graph
139:27 - so G graph is the one I usually use I
139:29 - think we'll go ahead and install that
139:32 - there's another
139:34 - one um I'm not sure like get
139:37 - lens some of these can get pretty crazy
139:40 - so I try to keep it really simple get
139:44 - history yeah we'll stick with G graft
139:46 - and so once get graph is installed if we
139:49 - go over to here we should have a new
139:51 - icon up
139:53 - here um and so I don't see it sometimes
139:56 - down below it'll be down here so I can
139:58 - click this no that doesn't help either
140:01 - and so maybe what we need to do is
140:02 - reload our environment for it to show up
140:03 - I'm going to hit Refresh on here and
140:05 - just hit enter and so hopefully what
140:07 - this will do is load it up again so we
140:09 - can see that because I want to see that
140:11 - g
140:12 - graph what do you mean doesn't
140:15 - exist uh okay
140:17 - it's telling me it didn't exist because
140:19 - I hit a refresh there
140:24 - um okay I'll open up code spaces because
140:26 - it seems like it's confused right
140:29 - now this one's
140:31 - running open in browser we'll try this
140:33 - again
140:41 - here give it a moment to
140:45 - reopen what do you mean ites doesn't
140:47 - exist it's right here you're crazy we
140:49 - have it open so it's saying it doesn't
140:52 - exist but we clearly have it
140:55 - open but it's opening the dogit
140:59 - directory okay let's CD back for a
141:02 - second what is going
141:06 - on oh no I really don't want to lose my
141:08 - changes I don't think I'm going to
141:10 - because everything's pushed but this is
141:11 - where it's kind of acting weird again I
141:13 - don't use gith GitHub codes spaces I
141:15 - prefer git pod but this one's acting a
141:17 - little bit funny um and so in this case
141:20 - I'm not 100% sure what to do because it
141:22 - does exist
141:26 - here so what I'm going to do is stop
141:28 - this code
141:30 - space okay and I'm going to start it up
141:32 - again and maybe what this will
141:34 - do is it will un Jank
141:38 - it okay so I'll be back here once once
141:42 - it stops and then restarts it takes a
141:44 - little bit of time okay okay it shows me
141:46 - this button I'm going to hit restart
141:47 - start code workspace and hopefully this
141:49 - will resolve our
141:52 - issue it's saying the workspace does not
141:54 - exist the terminal process failed to
141:56 - launch the starting directory so it's
141:58 - getting confused I don't know what's
142:00 - going on here but this workspace is is
142:03 - defunct so what I'm going to do is again
142:06 - stop this workspace we'll open up code
142:08 - spaces I'm going to stop this
142:11 - one and I'm going to delete it because
142:14 - it's not really doing what I wanted to
142:15 - do I'm not going to lose anything
142:17 - because everything we worked on we
142:18 - should have pushed at this
142:20 - point but uh yeah you just got to be
142:22 - careful code spaces because it kind of
142:24 - Acts a little
142:25 - funny but uh we'll go back over
142:29 - here and what I'm going to do is I
142:31 - actually want to open up this Branch we
142:32 - have the two branches but I want to open
142:35 - up code spaces in this Branch I'm going
142:36 - to go ahead and drop this down I'm going
142:38 - to say create a code space on dev okay
142:42 - and so hopefully we don't run into any
142:44 - more issues it looks like it's losing
142:46 - all my settings so it's not persisting
142:48 - them uh there are ways to persist
142:51 - them syncing settings
142:55 - um there's an option I think here we go
142:58 - into here because this is going to drive
142:59 - me crazy if we don't do this and we'll
143:02 - say automatically detect not DOT files
143:04 - but um sync settings so I'm going to
143:06 - click this and I'm hoping that what this
143:08 - will do is anytime we change branches or
143:11 - stuff it's going to remember my settings
143:12 - I don't want to keep changing them so
143:14 - I'm going to go here and it should be
143:16 - syncing settings now
143:18 - I'm going to go and change my theme
143:21 - again and I'm going to go over to
143:24 - settings I'm going to go to uh uh I'll
143:27 - change the font size to 20 here 20 was a
143:30 - bit too large we'll say terminal
143:32 - font here I'll change this to
143:36 - 18 okay and so I also want to make sure
143:41 - that my extension's installed so I'll
143:43 - try this
143:46 - again personally I think they should
143:48 - have this pre-installed that's the other
143:49 - one so there's get log graph and get
143:52 - graph I'm going to install both of these
143:54 - because I actually like both of them to
143:55 - be
143:56 - honest and uh we can add this to our Dev
144:00 - container yeah make a new Dev
144:03 - container um I don't know make an empty
144:05 - Dev
144:06 - container I want whatever the base one
144:08 - is
144:10 - base Bare
144:15 - Bones you know I just want the
144:17 - configuration I'm going to go ahead and
144:18 - just say barebones Ruby here
144:22 - sure and just say Okay I I don't want
144:25 - that so I'm just trying to create this
144:26 - file in here so it knows to remember our
144:30 - extensions um for this
144:32 - repo go back and do that also for here
144:34 - it should remember it but in case it
144:36 - doesn't I'm going to put this in here
144:38 - and I'm going to go modify the step
144:40 - container this is also something we're
144:41 - going to learn about later on um I don't
144:44 - want to build anything so I'm just going
144:46 - to take this out here here and I'm just
144:48 - going
144:49 - to take this out as well U just
144:55 - say basic
144:58 - config get graph I don't see the other
145:00 - one added there I'm G to go back over
145:02 - here and try this again get
145:04 - graph um add to Dev
145:08 - container there they're both added there
145:10 - but the reason I'm doing that is I
145:11 - really want to get these tools in here
145:12 - so now they're here they show up here
145:15 - and they show up down below so this is
145:17 - one of them we'll open that up it's
145:20 - before I made a pull request and there's
145:21 - the other one so I just want to show you
145:23 - there's more than one kind of tool that
145:24 - you can visualize the stuff and
145:26 - sometimes it give you different
145:28 - information and so right now we're here
145:31 - we're in Dev
145:33 - okay and we added that one those couple
145:35 - changes over here and the idea is that
145:38 - we branched over here so this doesn't
145:40 - know about these changes and vice versa
145:43 - and we got a whole lot going on here
145:45 - okay and so this is is where we get into
145:48 - things like merging so if we want to
145:52 - bring um Dev up to date with main which
145:55 - we really should do we should merge main
145:57 - into Deb and that's what I'm going to do
146:00 - so I'm in dab I'm going to type in get
146:04 - merge
146:06 - main um and sorry I should I should note
146:09 - that there's origin Main and then main
146:11 - so that's there's what's on Origin
146:12 - there's what's on our local Main and so
146:16 - our local Main might not have this stuff
146:19 - okay if I go over here it's a bit more
146:21 - clear because it shows them as separate
146:23 - thing so our head shows us exactly where
146:25 - we are right now we have origin Dev
146:26 - origin main so I'm going to do a get
146:27 - fetch because I want to know where we
146:29 - are right now and it looks like we're
146:31 - all up to date so we're
146:33 - fine what I'm going to do is I'm going
146:35 - to type in
146:37 - get
146:38 - merge
146:41 - Main and it's saying did you mean to
146:43 - merge no I wanted to merge Main and so
146:47 - it looks like we don't have a local
146:49 - branch of
146:50 - main okay so what I'm going to do is
146:52 - type in get checkout
146:54 - main okay and so now if we go back up
146:57 - here we maybe there's some way to
146:58 - refresh this like a refresh button
147:01 - notice there's two now okay so before it
147:04 - didn't even know there was a main I did
147:05 - check out and immediately it said there
147:08 - was no main branch but it said oh you
147:09 - have one on Origin main we'll just add
147:11 - it here now it's here okay so now we
147:13 - have a main and I can go back
147:15 - to
147:17 - Dev and I'm just going to do get fet
147:19 - it's just out of habit and so now we see
147:22 - both of them here okay so now I'm going
147:24 - to do get
147:26 - merge
147:28 - main it says we have a conflict okay and
147:31 - the reason why is that we went ahead and
147:33 - we changed read me and that other file
147:35 - and they exist there as well and so
147:37 - sometimes you have to resolve
147:40 - conflicts okay so this say Auto merging
147:43 - merging conflict automatic merge failed
147:46 - fa fix the conflictions in order to
147:49 - complete this here and so normally what
147:51 - happens if you
147:53 - pull or sorry if you try to do if you
147:55 - try to do a pull or you try to merge and
147:56 - there's a conflict you have to resolve
147:58 - it and so notice right away that now we
148:00 - have new files over here this wasn't
148:01 - here before we go here we can see type
148:05 - in get status it wants us to resolve it
148:09 - and the message is a little bit
148:10 - different here says you have un unmerged
148:12 - paths so we gotta fix this here and so
148:15 - it's showing us in this file we have two
148:17 - versions which one do you want to keep
148:19 - the top one or the bottom
148:20 - one so I'm going to just take the top
148:22 - part and take out this part because we
148:24 - don't want that
148:25 - committed and so these it had no
148:29 - problem and so what I want to do is I
148:31 - just want to go ahead and add this and
148:33 - we're basically just adding everything
148:34 - uh adding everything at this point so
148:36 - I'm say get add all and then I going to
148:38 - say
148:39 - get commit and in this case you do not
148:43 - want to put a a get commit message in
148:45 - here because it needs to put it its own
148:47 - in here I'm going to hit enter and it's
148:49 - going to open and this is the this is
148:51 - the merge message it has to be this you
148:53 - don't ever set this so notice I typed in
148:56 - get commit and it also filled it in here
148:58 - and so all I'm going to do is close this
149:01 - and now it's merged it so if we go back
149:04 - over here now we can see it
149:07 - represented okay so we took that and we
149:10 - brought that up to dat right okay so and
149:13 - the reason we want to do that is so that
149:14 - when we merge back into main we don't
149:16 - have to deal with conflicts you really
149:17 - don't want to deal with conflicts
149:19 - merging in main you want to do deal with
149:20 - those those conflicts in your branch
149:22 - before you merge back in main okay so
149:26 - that's good now what we can do is now
149:29 - that we're all up to date we can
149:30 - continue to work on our readme file so I
149:32 - don't need this dogger file this wasn't
149:34 - supposed to be here but that's a great
149:36 - opportunity for us to delete it because
149:37 - I don't want to launch up a ruby
149:39 - environment um so what I'm going to do
149:40 - is type in
149:42 - get um get
149:45 - remove
149:47 - well first I want to yeah get
149:49 - remove Docker
149:53 - file no no no I don't want to do that um
149:56 - I just want I'm going to go ahead and
149:57 - delete this here we'll just delete this
149:59 - permanently so if we go over here this
150:01 - should show up here yeah we can do
150:03 - that I think we could have just typed in
150:06 - if we deleted the file it would show up
150:07 - there anyway but um G remove is a bit
150:10 - funny because you can have files you
150:11 - want to remove from tracking that are in
150:14 - your repo to say stop tracking this
150:15 - forever
150:17 - um or uh if there's even there's pre
150:19 - previous versions of it and there's
150:20 - removing the file so we'll just delete
150:22 - and now we'll keep it simple so I'm
150:24 - going say get ad and we'll say get
150:27 - commit hyphen M remove Docker file we
150:30 - don't want to build a Ruby Ruby
150:35 - environment um so this I have to put a
150:39 - single comma there so I need to point
150:41 - out that like we can rebuild our codes
150:43 - space um and and then it would build
150:45 - that Docker file but but we'd have to
150:47 - manually do that because it won't do
150:48 - that until we rebuild it manually but
150:50 - anyway so we have that Chang there and
150:53 - I'm going to go ahead and do a get push
150:55 - and we go back and take a look and we
150:57 - can see that this is now pushed up to
150:59 - date it wasn't pushed there a moment ago
151:01 - and so now Main's starting to get out of
151:02 - date but let's go over to our readme
151:05 - file in our crash course and what I want
151:09 - to do here so I want to do a few a bit
151:13 - more
151:14 - documentation so we'll go down here here
151:17 - below and
151:19 - so we can add
151:21 - remotes but often you will just add
151:25 - remotes when you are doing uh when
151:29 - you via
151:32 - Upstream when adding a
151:37 - branch so be get
151:39 - Branch um U origin new
151:44 - feature but you could do it like a get
151:47 - remote at I like I rarely ever do that
151:50 - so I I don't feel like really covering
151:52 - that here that would be something I
151:54 - would actually cover in a proper uh get
151:56 - crash course
151:58 - um I don't know if we really need to do
152:00 - stashing right now we could leave it or
152:02 - take it get merge
152:05 - main so get checkout Dev get merge
152:11 - main
152:14 - okay so I like we've done a lot here I
152:17 - don't want to overload you folks um I
152:20 - think I'll just show you stashing really
152:21 - quick so um let's
152:24 - say let's say I wasn't I wanted to work
152:26 - on something else and I just wanted to
152:28 - move this to a side and come back to it
152:30 - later what I can do is add all the file
152:32 - so it's
152:34 - staged get status okay and I could just
152:38 - stash these for layer I type in get
152:41 - stash and what that will do is it will
152:43 - put it in in I'll just put it somewhere
152:46 - okay it'll put in my stash if I type in
152:47 - get stash list it's here in my stash
152:50 - okay and I can bring it back and say get
152:52 - stash pop and pop it off the stash and
152:55 - bring it back you wouldn't want to do
152:57 - this in a cloud developer environment
152:58 - because you could lose changes but if
153:00 - you're in a local developer environment
153:02 - you might just have stashes and just
153:04 - hold on to them for a long time but a
153:05 - lot of times you need to move things out
153:06 - of the way but usually you want to name
153:09 - your stash so you'll say get stash save
153:12 - and then say
153:14 - um read me change
153:16 - so we know exactly what it is and then
153:18 - we can do get stash list and see what's
153:21 - there and then we can say get stash
153:23 - apply and instead of popping it'll just
153:25 - apply the last one um so there are some
153:28 - commands there that are useful so we
153:29 - have get stash
153:33 - list get stash get
153:39 - stash save my name then get
153:45 - stash
153:47 - uh apply a pop and we have apply and
153:50 - then we have get stash pop okay so those
153:55 - are really useful I use them all the
153:56 - time again I'm hoping that as we go
153:59 - through this course we'll run into
154:00 - scenarios where we need to use them um
154:02 - but I do actually want to add this so
154:03 - I'm going to go ahead and get get
154:06 - commit hyph M minor
154:09 - updates um I'm just going to refresh
154:11 - this make sure I have that latest one
154:13 - there sometimes you miss them and I'm
154:15 - going to go ahead and do that
154:16 - and I just want to show you what the
154:18 - graph looks like so you can see even
154:20 - shows the stashes as well and dev's in
154:23 - front of it we're going to do get
154:25 - push
154:26 - okay now let's say we wanted to do a
154:29 - pull request that's something we're
154:30 - going to learn later in more detail but
154:32 - I'm going to just do it really quickly a
154:33 - common thing that you should do is open
154:35 - up pull request so
154:38 - um I'm kind of done with this uh
154:41 - workspace I'm going to go ahead and just
154:42 - close it out because I think the rest of
154:44 - this we don't need to do in here I'm
154:45 - going to go ahead and stop this okay we
154:49 - can leave it in this state if we come
154:51 - decide to come back to this but I'm
154:52 - going to just stop it for now and I want
154:54 - to go back to our
154:57 - repo
154:59 - GitHub Andie
155:02 - Brown and we'll go to our
155:04 - repo and I'm going to go ahead and open
155:06 - up a new pull request so I'll go here
155:09 - I'm going to create a new po request and
155:10 - I want to have the polar request come
155:13 - from Dev
155:14 - into this it's showing me everything I'm
155:17 - not sure why it's doing that but I'm
155:18 - going to go here and go from
155:19 - Dev into Maine and from Andrew Brown
155:22 - into Andrew Brown I want to be into my
155:24 - own I want to merge I want to make a
155:26 - pull request into my own there we go
155:27 - it's simplified that's what you should
155:28 - see and so what I'll go go ahead to do
155:30 - is hit create pull request and the idea
155:32 - is that this would be an opportunity for
155:34 - people to review it so uh will you
155:37 - accept my code
155:39 - right and the idea is that somebody's
155:42 - supposed to review it now because I'm
155:44 - the only one in my own repo
155:46 - um I'm just going to merge it myself and
155:48 - confirm that and so the idea is that
155:51 - that is now merged if we were in GitHub
155:53 - we would see that that was now merged
155:55 - into main okay all right so now what I
155:59 - want to show you is just the last thing
156:01 - is I just want to show you how I would
156:03 - bring these changes into my Fork so I'm
156:05 - going to switch back into my other
156:07 - account actually before I do that I'm
156:08 - going to go ahead and go into my poll
156:10 - request and I'm going to create a new
156:12 - pull request and I'm going to make a
156:14 - pull request from Main from this GitHub
156:17 - account into the exam Pro one the base
156:20 - one I'm going to go ahead and create
156:21 - this poll request I'm not telling you to
156:23 - do this please don't do this because I
156:25 - don't want to deal with a bunch of pull
156:26 - requests this will be uh documentation
156:31 - changes documentation for
156:34 - GitHub uh or sorry
156:39 - git crash course I think I called this
156:42 - like GitHub crash course which it should
156:44 - be really GitHub git crash sces show me
156:47 - the
156:48 - basics of G okay so go ahead and create
156:52 - that pull
156:53 - request all right and the thing is like
156:57 - I can't merge it from here because I
156:59 - don't own that other one so what I'll do
157:01 - is switch over to
157:03 - this and now I'm going to go and see
157:05 - that there's a poll request and it's
157:07 - coming in from Andrew Brown oh how nice
157:09 - of this person and I'm going to go take
157:10 - a look here and I can see that they have
157:13 - some changes and I can go and review
157:15 - their C Cod and then ask them to make
157:17 - fixes I can go here and say hey do this
157:19 - do that and then I might accept it but
157:21 - I'm going to go ahead and approve it I
157:23 - don't need to approve it here because
157:24 - there's no required reviewers for this
157:26 - but I'll just say it's
157:28 - approved and then we'll go over to code
157:31 - and I'm going to go ahead and sorry pull
157:34 - requests I'm going to go ahead and merge
157:37 - this stuff in because I I want this
157:39 - stuff okay and we'll merge that in and
157:43 - now it's merged just one other thing I
157:45 - want to want to see if I actually named
157:46 - this right get crash course yeah it's
157:48 - named right okay great and so there's
157:50 - our stuff that's all the stuff we
157:51 - learned was this a mess yes could I have
157:54 - taught this a lot better if I organized
157:56 - it yeah but I got to record the rest of
157:59 - the course and again you know if I'm
158:01 - going to make a a proper get crash
158:03 - course I'll do it somewhere else um but
158:05 - I just want to get you the basics and
158:07 - hopefully that was helpful we wasted a
158:09 - lot of time on cloning but that's
158:11 - something that's really important to
158:11 - know how to do and I'll see you in the
158:13 - next one
158:14 - ciao
158:18 - [Music]
158:19 - hey this is Angie Brown from exam Pro
158:21 - and we are taking a look at get commit
158:23 - so we're going to take a look at a
158:25 - series of G components uh in this course
158:29 - um it's not really a focus on get skills
158:32 - but more so GitHub but I want to make
158:35 - sure you still have some git skills so
158:37 - after we go through uh some of these
158:38 - things I'll then do like a really quick
158:40 - and dirty uh git uh command crash course
158:44 - okay so a g commit represents
158:46 - incremental changes to a codebase
158:47 - represented with a git tree so a graph
158:50 - at a specific time so here we can see
158:54 - that git tree um this is in GitHub so
158:58 - it's not the full representation when we
159:00 - go into U vs code we will we can see a
159:04 - better representation of it there are
159:06 - external tools for that but for the most
159:08 - part the idea is that you have um uh you
159:11 - have get commits that are over a
159:13 - historical period of time then we have
159:15 - have our uh git commit here is one
159:18 - within uh GitHub that I clicked through
159:20 - and I looked at okay and from here a get
159:24 - commit contains additional modifications
159:26 - deletions of files uh additions and
159:28 - deletions of file contents and it's not
159:31 - the whole file themselves and this is a
159:34 - strategy to make the uh commits
159:38 - efficient because if you if you were to
159:39 - store full copies in every single commit
159:42 - your repo would get really big really
159:45 - fast I'm going to repeat that again and
159:47 - we'll talk about the contents of commit
159:49 - fils here just shortly each commit has a
159:52 - Shaw hash that acts as an ID so it looks
159:55 - something like this we can use this uh
159:58 - to check out very specific commits which
160:01 - is very useful I want to repeat git does
160:04 - not store the whole files in each commit
160:06 - but rather the state of changes this
160:08 - greatly reduces the file size so uh so
160:12 - for developers to the developer you it
160:14 - will look like a whole file but really
160:16 - when you store it in in uh your git tree
160:19 - it's not going to be like that um so
160:22 - what are the components of a git commit
160:23 - we talked a little bit about that but we
160:25 - have that commit hash that is a unique
160:28 - Shaw one hash identifier for the commit
160:30 - I don't know if it's really Shaw one
160:31 - because I'm not really familiar with all
160:33 - the different types of Shaw but it's
160:34 - Shaw something uh we have the author
160:36 - information so we have name and email
160:39 - often you have to configure git to say
160:41 - what email you're utilizing the name so
160:43 - that's attached to the commit message uh
160:45 - or the commit itself you have the commit
160:47 - message this is the description of uh
160:50 - the the Commit This is we're going to be
160:52 - spending a lot of time when you are
160:53 - making commits because you want to write
160:55 - good commit messages you have a time
160:57 - stamp so this is the day and time when
160:58 - the commit was made um you have the
161:01 - parent commit hash this is a sha and
161:03 - hash of the Commit This commit is based
161:05 - on I don't really understand that
161:07 - because I've never had to bother with
161:09 - the parent one but it is something
161:11 - that's in there and the snapshot of the
161:13 - content a snapshot of the project at the
161:15 - time the commit not the actual files but
161:18 - references to them and the changes that
161:20 - are occurring so if you had vs code open
161:23 - and we were taking a look at a um at uh
161:27 - changes that we have staged so they
161:29 - haven't been committed yet but you can
161:31 - see here we have uh the commit message
161:33 - it says remove old comments we have
161:35 - files changed that we plan on putting in
161:37 - the commit and you can see some
161:40 - deletions there on the right hand side
161:41 - we can have additions so hopefully it's
161:43 - very clear what a uh a git commit is you
161:47 - are going to need to know these basic
161:50 - commands and we will get a little bit
161:53 - practice again quick and dirty this is
161:55 - not a full-blown git course but it'll be
161:57 - enough to get you by so that you can do
161:58 - the GitHub stuff so we have a bunch of
162:00 - stuff there like get add get remove get
162:03 - Comm message with the The Hyphen m flag
162:05 - to add a message hyphen a to
162:07 - automatically stage all track changes if
162:09 - you have a commit you haven't pushed it
162:11 - up uh to your uh your remote repo you
162:14 - can amend it
162:16 - um you can create empty commits uh you
162:19 - can specify the author if you need to
162:21 - you can check out a very specific commit
162:23 - but yeah that is get commits in a
162:25 - nutshell I'll see you in the next one
162:28 - [Music]
162:31 - ciao hey this is Angie Brown and we are
162:33 - taking a look at git Branch so G branch
162:36 - is a Divergence of the state of the repo
162:39 - there might be better uh descriptions
162:42 - than that but that's the way I think of
162:43 - it you can think of branches as being
162:46 - copies of a point in time that have been
162:48 - modified to be different and so what I
162:51 - want to do is Step you through what it
162:53 - would look like working with get
162:54 - branches and this is going to be a
162:56 - little bit messy and it doesn't matter
162:58 - if you can remember or make sense of all
163:00 - this because it will make more sense
163:01 - when we start working with it but do
163:03 - your best to follow along here so
163:04 - imagine we have a git repo in that git
163:07 - repo we have a main branch and basically
163:11 - all git repos have a main branch and
163:13 - that's pretty much the standard name for
163:15 - them now and we're going to also have a
163:17 - production Branch so the main branch is
163:18 - where we're going to have code uh that
163:22 - features and bugs will be um rolled up
163:25 - into and then when we're ready to push
163:26 - it out for production it will go to the
163:28 - production branch and some cicd tool
163:31 - we'll push it out and automatically
163:32 - deploy it so um let's imagine we already
163:36 - have a commit in the main branch uh
163:38 - maybe there are previous versions in the
163:40 - production Branch we're not going to
163:41 - worry about it so uh you have developer
163:43 - a developer a needs to to work on a very
163:47 - specific feature they're going to open
163:48 - up a feature branch and in there they're
163:50 - going to put in some commits and they're
163:52 - working along uh meanwhile in the
163:55 - company somebody already has pushed some
163:57 - stuff into the main branch it's not
163:59 - ready to go in production but that
164:00 - commit is now out so what's important to
164:03 - note here is that feature Branch one is
164:06 - not aware of that new commit because
164:08 - things are happening asynchronous a in
164:10 - async manner in different branches and
164:13 - this is the challenge with get is that
164:14 - you have to deal with all this Asing
164:16 - stuff and make sure you bring those
164:18 - changes into yours deal with conflicts
164:21 - things like that now let's say we have
164:23 - developer B and developer B is working
164:25 - on feature Branch to and when they
164:27 - started on their on their um uh their
164:31 - feature they decided to Branch from this
164:34 - point in time okay and so they start
164:36 - working on it and they get their feature
164:38 - uh done and um they get they talk to
164:42 - their um uh the director of engineering
164:45 - and and they make a poll request the
164:47 - poll request gets accepted it gets
164:49 - merged back into main okay and
164:52 - so developer a who's working on uh
164:55 - feature Branch one has all these changes
164:58 - that they still don't have so let's
165:00 - remember that they're going to have to
165:01 - deal with that at some point but anyway
165:03 - that feature got merged into Main and it
165:05 - looks like it's ready to go into
165:07 - production so it gets merged into
165:08 - production and so this particular commit
165:12 - contains I'm G get my pen out here
165:14 - contains all of this information right
165:18 - and it's all packed into here if that
165:20 - makes sense okay I'm just going to erase
165:22 - that here and so that gets ped
165:25 - production and it gets tagged a lot of
165:27 - cicd systems will trigger when a tag is
165:30 - applied that's definitely how I do it
165:32 - but now coming back to developer a
165:34 - they're on feature Branch one and they
165:36 - have all the stuff um that they need to
165:39 - get their Branch up to date so what
165:40 - they'll do is they'll merge back in in
165:43 - their Direction I know it doesn't show a
165:45 - merge but they'll merge that information
165:48 - into feature Branch one so they are now
165:51 - up to date and they have now finish
165:53 - their feature by doing a bit extra work
165:55 - and so they've merged back into into the
165:56 - main branch and now their stuff is to be
165:58 - rolled up to production so it gets
166:00 - merged into production and then that
166:02 - gets Tagged so hopefully that gives you
166:04 - kind of an idea of uh this kind of
166:08 - workflow this should have really been
166:09 - like that uh and this actually has a
166:11 - very particular name it's called the
166:13 - GitHub flow now there are some
166:15 - variations of this so that's why I say
166:17 - very close to it because in case I'm
166:18 - wrong I want to have that buffer to say
166:21 - that well I didn't say this is exactly
166:22 - the GitHub workflow but this more or
166:25 - less is the GitHub workflow where you
166:26 - are creating branches feature branches
166:29 - merging it back into some other branch
166:31 - and then you have a branch for
166:33 - production uh you can have branches for
166:35 - all sorts of things you can have
166:36 - specific environment Branch branches
166:38 - like staging development production you
166:40 - can have specific branches to developers
166:42 - so like based on their names you can
166:44 - have branches per feature features
166:45 - branches per bugs is going to be based
166:47 - on what your team wants to do all right
166:50 - uh there are definitely get Branch
166:52 - commands you should absolutely know and
166:54 - we will do again a quick quick and dirty
166:56 - crash course so you are familiar with it
166:58 - this is a extremely common pattern that
167:01 - you're going to find that you'll be
167:02 - doing which is you'll be creating a new
167:04 - Branch for a feature you're going to be
167:06 - adding changes you're going to be
167:07 - pushing it Upstream we might do this via
167:11 - vs code using the G CLI we might be
167:14 - doing this using using GitHub uh
167:16 - creating a branch from an issue but
167:18 - we'll definitely be doing this because
167:19 - this is something that happens a lot um
167:22 - in professional um uh teams is that
167:26 - they're creating feature branches so
167:27 - hopefully that makes sense and again if
167:29 - it doesn't wait till we go ahead and do
167:31 - it and then it will make more sense then
167:33 - okay
167:34 - [Music]
167:37 - ciao hey this is Angie Brown and we are
167:39 - taking a look at get repos so these
167:42 - represent the reference to a remote
167:44 - location where a copy of your repo is
167:46 - hosted so when I say remote get remote
167:50 - I'm saying remote reference or remote
167:52 - ref you might see those terms uh used
167:55 - all over the place uh you can have
167:57 - multiple remote entries uh or remote
168:00 - references for your git repo and the
168:02 - most common one you're going to see is
168:04 - called origin it's almost always uh
168:07 - there everybody seems to use it it
168:09 - indicates the central or golden repo
168:11 - everyone is working from and represents
168:13 - the source of Truth
168:15 - uh the remote entries or references are
168:17 - stored in your dogit config we don't
168:20 - really talk about this dogit folder in
168:22 - any of the slides but the dogit folder
168:25 - is how you know that your project is a
168:29 - uh has a a git repo in it because it
168:32 - needs that folder uh to initialize a git
168:35 - repo we'll look at that in the quick and
168:37 - dirty crash course um so in here in the
168:42 - config file you can see we have remote
168:44 - defined so this format of a file is
168:46 - called a toml file um so anytime you see
168:49 - those Square braces and then definitions
168:51 - that's usually a toml file but I'm just
168:53 - going to get my pen tool out here the
168:55 - idea here is we're saying we uh we have
168:57 - a remote named origin and the URL is
169:00 - pointing to our GitHub repo this part
169:04 - says how it should fetch I'm not going
169:06 - to get into that right now and then down
169:08 - below we can see we have some branches
169:10 - that we are tracking and they're
169:12 - pointing to remote origin and then they
169:14 - they're saying that we want to merge um
169:18 - there so hopefully that is clear notice
169:22 - remote names can be referenced so we
169:24 - have origin up here and it's referencing
169:27 - this up here okay so I'm just going to
169:31 - clear my annotations here so this is a
169:32 - little bit more clear and there are a
169:34 - bunch of get remote commands you should
169:37 - know I don't remember the most like the
169:39 - git remote ad I don't ever remember that
169:42 - one because often when you clone it's
169:45 - going to add them anyway and so usually
169:47 - you pull them from GitHub but you should
169:49 - know push you should know pull you
169:51 - should know fetch uh and when you are
169:54 - creating branches you should know um how
169:56 - to uh push upstream and we'll talk about
169:59 - upstream and downstream next
170:02 - [Music]
170:05 - okay all right let's talk about the
170:07 - concepts of upstream and downstream so
170:09 - imagine we have GitHub who is hosting
170:12 - our remote repository and then we have
170:14 - our local developer environment or Cloud
170:17 - developer environment uh this is local
170:19 - basically where we are doing our work
170:21 - and so they both have a main repo
170:24 - because we know that git is
170:25 - decentralized so we can have repos in
170:27 - more than one place we might already
170:29 - have some commits on the remote side but
170:32 - what's going to glue these two together
170:34 - is going to be the remote and so we set
170:37 - up a remote tracking Branch okay and and
170:40 - you'll see that turn when you create uh
170:43 - and you push branches up because the
170:44 - idea is that it's tracking uh the origin
170:47 - is pointing to main so this is the way
170:49 - we track them uh we saw that was stored
170:52 - in theg getconfig so when we go ahead
170:55 - and we perform a poll from our local
170:57 - developer environment we call this
170:59 - Downstream we're pulling Downstream so a
171:02 - repo that pulls or clones from another
171:05 - repo and just understand this is
171:07 - relative to the direction or the
171:09 - perspective um of who's pulling so if
171:12 - the remote was pulling it would be down
171:14 - stream it's it's anytime you're pulling
171:16 - it's always Downstream and now imagine
171:19 - we have commits we've been working
171:21 - locally we want to push those up to
171:24 - remote we would call that Upstream so
171:26 - this is when you are pushing changes so
171:28 - that's Upstream that's Downstream and
171:31 - when we have a remote reference it is a
171:34 - tracking Branch so there you go
171:37 - [Music]
171:40 - okay hey this is angre brown we are
171:42 - taking a look at GitHub flow so this is
171:45 - a lightweight workflow for multiple
171:47 - developers working on a single repo
171:49 - there's a lot of variations on this uh
171:51 - so this is not a technically perfect
171:54 - description of it but there really isn't
171:56 - one and I want to show you a really old
171:59 - graphic um I don't know how old this is
172:02 - but I've seen this in older ones maybe
172:04 - all the way back to 2008 at least and I
172:07 - remember before GitHub flow because
172:10 - GitHub came or sorry git came out in
172:12 - 2005 and it took a few years to gain
172:14 - adoption
172:15 - so for a long period for a few years we
172:18 - just had a mess of stuff and then
172:19 - somebody came up with this maybe it was
172:22 - GitHub I'm not sure but uh it's called
172:24 - the GitHub flow and um here we have a
172:28 - bunch of branches and it looks very
172:30 - similar to the one that I showed you in
172:32 - get Branch it's a little bit different
172:34 - and so the big difference is that well
172:36 - first of all uh we don't call it Master
172:38 - anymore we call it main but my main was
172:40 - the develop branch and then I would call
172:43 - this Branch master I would have called
172:44 - it production because I think that makes
172:46 - more sense and a lot of people do that
172:48 - these days but when it first came out
172:50 - this is how we were doing it okay so
172:52 - understand as variation but the idea is
172:54 - that you have this one branch I call it
172:56 - main this is developed and it holds
172:59 - things that um that uh that hold feature
173:03 - branches or hot fixes and everything
173:05 - it's basically like rolls everything up
173:06 - but it's not in production yet and so
173:08 - the idea is that when these things are
173:10 - ready for um production you can push
173:14 - them out into a release Branch a release
173:16 - Branch could be also called staging
173:19 - that's normally what we call uh today
173:21 - and this could be where it would roll
173:23 - out so once you push stuff here this
173:25 - could go out and execute a cicd pipeline
173:29 - and it would set up a staging
173:30 - environment so that QA could be done on
173:32 - it or any kind of load balancing could
173:34 - be done on it or stress testing um there
173:38 - and the idea is that as developers you
173:40 - would open up feature branches off of
173:42 - develop and as you complete them they
173:44 - would come back in here uh and they
173:46 - would get merged in and then when things
173:48 - were really ready you take it take it
173:51 - from uh release branches and push it out
173:53 - to your production branch which they're
173:55 - calling uh here uh Master if for
173:58 - whatever reason you had a serious
174:00 - problem you had to fix really quickly
174:02 - you could um uh create a branch off a
174:06 - master into the hot fixes and then merge
174:08 - it back in skipping all the stuff down
174:10 - below uh you know again I wouldn't do it
174:13 - this way anymore I would be surprised if
174:15 - companies are sticking uh to this method
174:17 - but this is the original way I just
174:19 - wanted to show you that there is
174:20 - variation um and you know a lot of
174:23 - people do skip having a release branch
174:25 - and they'll just deploy often and into
174:28 - production so it's going to be really
174:29 - dependent on your team so here we'll
174:32 - just kind of loosely describe GitHub
174:34 - flow you create a branch for each new
174:36 - task or feature create a new Branch off
174:38 - the main branch add commits make changes
174:41 - in commits commit them to your branch
174:43 - open a poll request start a discussion
174:44 - about your commits reviewing code in the
174:46 - poll request discuss a review share your
174:48 - poll requests with teammates for
174:50 - feedback deploy test your changes in
174:52 - production environment um so yeah oh and
174:55 - the last thing would be merge so once
174:57 - your changes are verified merge them
174:58 - into the main branch so that's the
175:00 - general concepts of it and hopefully
175:01 - that makes sense and we will see you in
175:03 - the next
175:04 - [Music]
175:08 - one hey this is Angie Brown and we are
175:10 - taking a look at the GitHub CLI so this
175:12 - is a command line interface to interact
175:14 - with your GitHub account you can quickly
175:16 - perform common GitHub actions without
175:18 - leaving your developer environment and
175:21 - uh if you went through the quick and
175:23 - dirty um git uh crash course then you
175:27 - definitely got some exposure to GitHub
175:29 - CLI but the idea is that you'd have to
175:31 - log in you can perform actions there so
175:33 - we have something like creating a repo
175:35 - creating an issue uh reviewing a PR
175:37 - there's a lot of uh CLI commands uh the
175:40 - get up clii can be installed on Windows
175:42 - Linux or Mac OS um that's an example of
175:45 - using Brew to install it if you have it
175:47 - for um uh Dev containers you can specify
175:51 - it as a feature to get installed so that
175:53 - is a very easy and quick way to have it
175:56 - uh installed there and just to give an
175:58 - idea of commands we have our core
176:00 - commands we have a lot of additional
176:02 - commands and then we have one specific
176:04 - to GitHub uh actions command so we're
176:06 - definitely going to get some exposure uh
176:08 - to GitHub CLI uh in this course but
176:11 - there you
176:13 - go
176:16 - [Music]
176:17 - all right so in this follow along I want
176:18 - to take a look at the GitHub CLI and see
176:20 - if we can do a few different things with
176:22 - it what I'm going to do is switch over
176:24 - to my other account um this is just my
176:27 - uh playaround account for for GitHub and
176:30 - we should already have a repo in here
176:31 - called GitHub examples and what I want
176:34 - to do is I want to um you know just do
176:37 - some things in the CLI so I need some
176:39 - kind of environment to work in and so
176:41 - what we'll do is launch up a code space
176:44 - uh we do have this older one
176:47 - um I think what I'll do is make a new
176:49 - one I don't think it really matters if
176:50 - we make an old or new one that other one
176:52 - is stopped so we'll open this one up and
176:54 - we'll see if the GitHub CLI is already
176:56 - pre-installed it could be pre-installed
176:57 - on this because I would think that if
177:00 - well if I was GitHub I would have it
177:02 - pre-installed so people could start
177:03 - using my product right away but if it's
177:05 - not we'll definitely go ahead and take a
177:07 - look at how to install it we did install
177:09 - it manually locally um in the git crash
177:13 - course a quick and dirty crash course so
177:16 - uh you know if we don't have to show the
177:17 - install I'd rather skip that but we'll
177:20 - wait for this to spin up okay I have no
177:22 - idea why but that took a little bit time
177:24 - to spin up um you know our goal isn't to
177:26 - really make anything just to play around
177:27 - with the um the CLI here the code space
177:29 - is currently running in recovery mode
177:31 - due to configuration error I didn't do
177:33 - anything I don't care it's um I mean
177:36 - it's a new environment why should it be
177:39 - recovering is there something it can't
177:43 - do yeah I'm not sure about this so what
177:45 - I'm going to do because I don't trust
177:47 - this
177:49 - workspace is um this one is running
177:53 - here I don't know we'll just see what we
177:56 - can do with it but it didn't pick up myh
177:57 - settings when I told it to save it
177:59 - earlier so I don't know if it's because
178:01 - it's in recovery mode or not but for the
178:02 - time being I'm going to go ahead and
178:04 - change the theme so I'm not upset there
178:07 - we go that's a lot better and I want to
178:10 - see if we
178:11 - have um GH install so it's not installed
178:16 - which is totally fine um so what I'm
178:18 - going to
178:19 - do
178:21 - is if we had this installed can we
178:23 - install it through here sometimes you
178:25 - can install stuff through plugins
178:29 - right and so I'm just curious if we
178:31 - could do that there no okay so that's
178:32 - fine we'll go ahead and install this and
178:35 - I definitely know that Brew is installed
178:38 - or maybe it's not installed on this
178:39 - let's find out it is installed on git
178:41 - pod but I'm not sure about GitHub it's
178:43 - not okay so what we'll do is we'll look
178:44 - up the GitHub CLI and we'll go ahead and
178:47 - install it we already did this before
178:48 - but we'll do it again and what we're
178:50 - looking for is those install
178:52 - instructions and we want it for um Linux
178:56 - okay so we'll go over into here into
178:57 - Linux and we'll grab this oneline
178:59 - command it looks like a lot but it's
179:01 - really just doing this update and this
179:03 - install like down here but it has to add
179:06 - the repo so it knows where to install it
179:08 - from but I'm going to grab that big
179:09 - thing there and we're going to go ahead
179:11 - and paste that on in say allow and hit
179:13 - enter
179:14 - and um it failed it failed and I can't
179:18 - look at I can't see what I'm doing so
179:20 - I'm G to bump up this font I do not like
179:23 - GitHub code spaces I'm so sorry I really
179:26 - like G pod and we're going to go here
179:28 - and say terminal
179:30 - font I'll try not to complain too much
179:33 - about it in the course but uh I can't
179:36 - promise anything I'm going to copy that
179:38 - again and we'll try this again it hit
179:41 - enter no such file directory okay
179:46 - um yeah I don't know what you want so
179:49 - there's this line
179:50 - here
179:53 - okay maybe because gpg gpg isn't
179:57 - installed sometimes you don't have to do
179:58 - a gpg check but we might have to with
180:02 - this and
180:05 - um failure to write destination okay so
180:09 - if that's not working maybe what we
180:10 - could do in an easier way is we could
180:13 - just add it
180:14 - um to the
180:16 - uh uh to the that this file this code
180:19 - space is file so we could just make a
180:20 - Dev container um and maybe that would be
180:23 - less of an issue so what I'll do is I
180:27 - want to add a Dev container um we'll go
180:29 - up to here Dev
180:32 - container like that we actually already
180:35 - have one from before and maybe we can
180:38 - just throw it in
180:39 - here so grab this maybe we do want to
180:42 - commit this maybe this is a good good
180:43 - idea um and so I'll put this
180:47 - here and I need a comma there and so the
180:49 - idea here is that this should install
180:51 - the CLI into this environment and maybe
180:54 - the reason why this thing messed up was
180:56 - because it wasn't specifying any base
180:58 - image and that's why it got upset
181:00 - because when we did this in the tutorial
181:02 - earlier um it kind of complained or
181:04 - sorry like when we spun this up it
181:06 - complained but we didn't specify a base
181:08 - image so I'm going to look up what the
181:10 - base image is for Dev
181:12 - container the base image for GitHub is
181:16 - and maybe that will help
181:20 - us if that doesn't help let's go let's
181:22 - go ask chaty
181:25 - BT log in let me in let me
181:30 - in come on I pay for this let me
181:35 - in what is the what is the base image
181:39 - used for uh Dev
181:42 - container
181:44 - for GitHub Cod
181:49 - spaces let's see if that can figure it
181:51 - out it's probably just going to go to
181:52 - the um the documentation but um I don't
181:56 - remember where it is
182:01 - so if you don't specify one it will
182:03 - create in the default one okay that's
182:05 - what I would rather it do so I'm going
182:07 - to leave it alone and what I want to do
182:09 - is rebuild uh this environment because
182:11 - we've added this change before we do I
182:12 - need to commit this maybe so just say um
182:15 - it should install the GitHub CLI go
182:19 - ahead and do
182:21 - that and I'll say
182:23 - okay so it should sync it up good and so
182:27 - let's see if we can find the rebuild I'm
182:28 - clicking up here rebuild that's no good
182:31 - we can open up the command pallet this
182:32 - way command pallet has all the commands
182:35 - for for vs code and there should
182:37 - probably be something for codes space so
182:38 - if I type in codes spaces there's
182:40 - probably something here to rebuild there
182:41 - it is rebuild container so I'm going to
182:43 - go ahead and rebuild that container I'm
182:45 - going to go ahead and hit rebuild and so
182:47 - I'm hoping that we'll install the CLI
182:49 - and that avoids us having to install gpg
182:51 - or whatever it wants because that's a
182:53 - headache and I don't want to deal with
182:54 - that so see you back here when this
182:56 - finish is building okay all right we're
182:58 - in it says the code space is currently
183:00 - running in recovery mode due to a
183:01 - configuration ER please review the
183:02 - creation logs update your Dev container
183:05 - as needed or rebuild the container so
183:07 - clearly doesn't like something about my
183:09 - file I'm not really sure because there's
183:11 - not a whole lot in it uh
183:14 - um so we have command control shift p
183:18 - okay control shift p hey like learning's
183:21 - learning right and uh we want to view
183:24 - creation blogs oh that's just to open up
183:26 - the uh command
183:28 - pallet view creation
183:31 - log and somewhere here it's messing up
183:34 - now I don't understand how it could be
183:36 - messing up because we literally have
183:37 - next nothing in
183:40 - it
183:42 - um
183:46 - yeah this is supposed to be an easy easy
183:48 - GitHub CLI
183:53 - tutorial failed to create the container
183:55 - an error occurred unified containers
183:58 - error creating fail doesn't even tell us
184:00 - why it's just like nope it doesn't work
184:02 - maybe it's up here
184:06 - um no matching entries and P unable to
184:10 - find us your Dev container okay maybe
184:11 - it's this
184:14 - okay let's take this out all right and
184:17 - uh that's probably the reason why okay
184:20 - so we'll save that okay we'll have to
184:24 - update that don't change remote
184:30 - user
184:33 - okay want Push to Main and I'm going to
184:35 - try to rebuild this
184:37 - again I'll open up command pallet down
184:39 - here below just in case and I want to
184:41 - say
184:42 - rebuild
184:46 - um I want to do like a full rebuild
184:48 - let's do a full
184:50 - rebuild that's fine let's rebuild and
184:53 - we'll get it going this next one okay
184:55 - I'll see you back in a
184:57 - moment okay so I think that resolve the
184:59 - issue it took a while for that to
185:01 - rebuild but what I want to see is if the
185:02 - C is in here so I'm going to type in GH
185:05 - and there it is okay great so that's the
185:07 - easy way to get in there as long as you
185:09 - don't make any mistakes in your Dev
185:11 - container uh Jason or J yes or Json Json
185:15 - file and so let's go ahead and see what
185:17 - kind of actions we can perform so what
185:18 - I'll do is go over and type in GitHub
185:20 - CLI and we'll take a look at the
185:22 - documentation and see that's not what I
185:25 - want I want the uh official
185:26 - documentation so we can see what kind of
185:29 - commands we can get here it is okay so
185:31 - here's all of our commands and the
185:33 - question first is are we logged in
185:35 - because that's something we might need
185:36 - to do so let's go ahead and type in GH
185:40 - login oh sorry GH off log in to log the
185:45 - C and we have two options we'll do
185:47 - github.com it says the value of the
185:50 - GitHub token environment is being used
185:51 - for authentication to uh okay so it
185:54 - sounds like we already are authenticated
185:56 - because of um get up code spaces and
186:00 - it's loading some kind of temporary um
186:02 - token in here something we could check
186:04 - here is to see if there actually is a
186:05 - token being set so I'm going to type in
186:07 - EnV grep and we'll type in
186:10 - GH and I don't see anything there but
186:13 - apparently it seems to think that it is
186:16 - ready to utilize so maybe what we could
186:18 - do is list out repos so I imagine if we
186:22 - go here there's probably something like
186:23 - list there is and we could try to list
186:25 - our repos so let's go ahead and try that
186:28 - GH repo
186:30 - list and we have a repo that's actually
186:32 - a really nice display what else can we
186:34 - take a look at here
186:36 - um so again back over to the
186:40 - repo we can list our repo what if we go
186:43 - to view what would that do let's take a
186:47 - look GH repo
186:50 - View and I was hoping that it would set
186:53 - it would select the current one but
186:56 - apparently it didn't but we can do uh GH
186:59 - repo set
187:01 - default
187:03 - and I got to type it right maybe it'll
187:05 - let us choose the repo so we don't have
187:07 - to goof around and so there it is we can
187:10 - choose one and apparently we have two
187:12 - exam Pro and the Andrew WC Brown curious
187:15 - that it's showing forked ones but this
187:17 - is the one I want CU this is the account
187:18 - I'm in right now and so let's go ahead
187:20 - and type in GH repo
187:23 - View and so now we can see some stuff in
187:25 - here um not a lot of information it
187:28 - looks like it's kind of the information
187:30 - about maybe the description or stuff
187:34 - like that so I was hoping to see a
187:37 - little bit more there but that's okay
187:39 - let's go down here and see what else we
187:40 - can
187:41 - do um we could edit our
187:45 - repo like we could change features turn
187:48 - things on or
187:49 - off that's not that interesting
187:52 - something we might want to do is maybe
187:54 - we might want to uh maybe change our
187:56 - labels let's go ahead and try that out
187:59 - so I'm going go here and say GH labels
188:02 - list um is it just label or labels
188:08 - label oh cool yeah we can see our codes
188:11 - can we add a new one in here
188:14 - uh we'll go to
188:16 - create so GH label so we try this one
188:19 - here copy it paste it
188:22 - in and there already is a bug so we
188:24 - can't have
188:25 - two so I'll go here and just say
188:29 - um
188:33 - danger something really not
188:36 - right we'll hit enter and so it looks
188:38 - like we've created another label let's
188:40 - go ahead and hit up okay so that looks
188:42 - really good there bug isn't working good
188:46 - um if we wanted to create a new repo
188:49 - sometimes what they'll do is they'll um
188:52 - they'll create like a uh a wizard in
188:54 - here so if I typed in GH create repo and
188:57 - I said
188:59 - um
189:01 - GitHub we just we'll just do this I bet
189:04 - it will prompt
189:05 - us oh I got to type it right I seem to
189:07 - be typing everything wrong here today
189:09 - repo
189:10 - create and so it'll ask us some things
189:12 - like create a repo from a template
189:14 - repository make a new one so I could do
189:16 - this say
189:18 - GitHub um
189:21 - repo GitHub CLI
189:24 - example and I'll just go hit enter here
189:27 - I'll just make this one private I could
189:29 - add a readme file we could add a Gore we
189:33 - could say what we want the get ignore to
189:35 - be so maybe it's for
189:36 - C++ now let's add a license we could
189:39 - choose apachi
189:41 - 2.0 um we want to do this we'll say yes
189:45 - and it seems like it should have created
189:47 - but we get a resource not accessible by
189:48 - integration for 43 so I'm not 100% sure
189:52 - as to why we're getting that it could be
189:53 - a permissions issue because everything
189:55 - is based on um that token right and so
189:59 - maybe we have a personal access token
190:01 - that allows us to read but not write um
190:05 - and we got a 403 right so 403 error is
190:10 - for forbidden meaning we don't have
190:12 - access to do it so what I'm thinking is
190:14 - that we can probably create our own um
190:16 - personal access token and try to get
190:18 - around that so we going to go to
190:20 - settings here I'm going to go all the
190:21 - way down develop for settings and we're
190:23 - going to go into personal access tokens
190:25 - find grain tokens and we'll generate a
190:27 - new token again I don't know if this
190:28 - will work but I'm just going to try it
190:29 - so we'll just say um uh repo
190:38 - access right let us create a repo and
190:42 - I'm I'm going to set this for tomorrow
190:45 - because I don't need it forever and if
190:49 - it's for all repos then that's a
190:51 - challenge right but then how would you
190:53 - create a
190:55 - token this is public repos so here it
190:58 - says this applies to current and future
190:59 - repos owned by this resource all all
191:01 - includes public repos read
191:05 - only so the other question is is it
191:07 - because we tried to make it a private
191:08 - repo but then why would it have it as an
191:10 - option if we can do that I mean we could
191:13 - also authenticate uh via SSH so I'm not
191:17 - sure so I guess that's where I'm not
191:20 - 100%
191:21 - sure so maybe we'll just say all repos
191:25 - here and we'll go to repo
191:27 - permissions and I'm looking specifically
191:30 - for
191:32 - repos contents
191:37 - no and carefully looking here to try to
191:40 - find
191:41 - that uh account permissions
191:47 - maybe it feels closer to
191:50 - this type in
191:55 - repo uh let's see
191:58 - here so what does this one
192:01 - do interaction limits uh interaction
192:03 - limits on repost I don't think it's
192:06 - that and so I'm just carefully looking
192:09 - to figure
192:10 - out what functionality we would have to
192:12 - Prov
192:16 - divide managing repository environments
192:19 - it could be this read
192:23 - write I would probably put this in just
192:25 - because that is the
192:28 - usual
192:30 - um oh repo creation it's up here so I
192:33 - don't think we need these other ones I'm
192:34 - going to leave them on because they're
192:35 - not that big of a
192:37 - deal um and this one says it's mandatory
192:40 - so sure we'll have that in there got it
192:41 - added in there I'm going to go ahead and
192:43 - generate this token and so now we have
192:45 - this token I'm going to copy it I'm
192:46 - going to go over to here I'm going to
192:48 - type in export GH token and I'm going to
192:51 - go ahead and paste this in and so the
192:53 - idea is that when we use the um uh the
192:58 - CLI it should pick up this as opposed to
193:00 - what what else is on here so I'm typing
193:02 - EnV hyphen GP because I want to make
193:05 - sure that this is actually set as our
193:06 - environment variable if you have other
193:08 - tabs open here it might not show up so
193:10 - just stay on the current tab we'll go
193:12 - ahead Andy try this again another reason
193:14 - why it might have not worked is because
193:16 - that name was already taken but I don't
193:17 - think so because it's scope based on our
193:19 - user so we go ahead and try this again
193:21 - from scratch so we say GitHub CLI
193:25 - example and then we'll say uh we'll put
193:28 - nothing in there we'll make it private
193:30 - and it was interesting there's a
193:31 - visibility of internal I imagine that
193:33 - maybe that's for Enterprises we'll say
193:36 - yes yes and it doesn't matter I'll just
193:39 - choose that one we'll say yes doesn't
193:42 - matter I'll choose that one and we'll
193:44 - say yes let's see if it works now clone
193:47 - the repo locally yeah sure let's do that
193:51 - and so now it's working so whatever key
193:53 - whatever personal access token that is
193:55 - somehow being loaded in there did not
193:57 - have the correct permissions we're able
193:59 - to get around that so I don't really
194:01 - want this repost I want to go ahead and
194:02 - delete it um let's go take a look and
194:04 - see what actions we have there we have
194:07 - delete so I'm going to hope that it just
194:09 - will like give me a wizard so I don't
194:10 - have to pick it so we'll say G H repo
194:14 - delete um and I don't want to delete our
194:17 - current one so I'm going to hit contrl C
194:19 - because that's totally not what I want
194:21 - and we'll go back over to here and we'll
194:23 - take a look and see what we can see for
194:26 - the uh repo I really wish they would
194:28 - list them up here maybe if we go to the
194:30 - getting
194:31 - started or available commands yeah
194:33 - that's a little bit
194:35 - easier it's not great but uh we'll go to
194:38 - repo here and we'll go to
194:40 - delete and we can can put the repo name
194:43 - here so we'll go
194:44 - back over to uh GitHub here we'll go to
194:48 - our name this is going to be Andrew WC
194:53 - Brown and we should be able to see two
194:55 - repos in
194:56 - here there's our other one I'm going to
194:59 - grab that
195:01 - name and we going to go back over here
195:03 - and I'm going to say that so do we want
195:06 - to delete
195:07 - it so type the name again sure and we
195:11 - have to put in all so uh the username in
195:13 - front of
195:17 - it we'll hit enter and that repost
195:20 - should be now deleted we'll go back over
195:22 - to
195:23 - here okay and it's deleted so that is in
195:26 - good shape so that's all good so I'm
195:29 - really happy with that I'm going to go
195:30 - ahead and stop this uh uh code code
195:32 - space I'm just going to delete
195:35 - it and you know I'm going to delete the
195:37 - other one I'm just going to make sure I
195:38 - keep everything nice and clean and and
195:40 - not worry about overspend and what I
195:43 - want to do is just merge this into my
195:44 - other account again you don't have to do
195:47 - this you can just watch me do this but
195:48 - it's good to watch because this is
195:51 - something that people have to do a lot
195:53 - and actually what I should have done is
195:55 - I should have gone over here and I
195:57 - should have done it from here first so
195:59 - I'm going to go here and create a PR
196:04 - create create a new PR and we'll say
196:08 - create is it going in the direction we
196:09 - want yes it is we'll hit create
196:13 - um fix Dev container we'll create that
196:17 - pull
196:18 - request good we'll switch back over to
196:21 - our other account and then I'm going to
196:23 - go into uh the same repo I'm going to
196:26 - accept it confirm it and we are in good
196:28 - shape I'll see you in the next one
196:31 - [Music]
196:34 - ciao a common strategy for
196:37 - authenticating uh to perform git
196:39 - operations on your remote GitHub repo is
196:41 - by using an s sh key uh you're
196:44 - definitely going to want to use this
196:45 - because it is a great way um to work
196:48 - with Git uh in your local developer
196:50 - environment it's definitely the way that
196:52 - I like to use it as opposed to using a
196:54 - personal access token but uh the way it
196:57 - works is you'll have to generate out
196:58 - your own SSH uh key using a command like
197:01 - SSH key gen for Linux there's probably
197:03 - different ways but that's the way that I
197:04 - know and specifically an RSA key I'm
197:07 - sure there's different kinds of uh keys
197:09 - that uh GitHub will take but that's the
197:11 - one that I know and so the idea here is
197:13 - that we have our computer our local
197:17 - computer and then we have the server
197:19 - which is a GitHub and the idea is that
197:21 - there will be a copy of the public and
197:23 - private key on your local computer and
197:25 - then on GitHub you'll store that private
197:27 - key and so the the process of
197:30 - authenticating and authorizing is going
197:32 - to go like this so the server checks to
197:34 - see if you have the same public key if
197:36 - you both have the same public key it's
197:38 - going to send you a challenge message
197:40 - that challenge message contains the
197:42 - public key uh encrypted and so it's
197:45 - going to send that on over and then uh
197:47 - the idea is that um the private key on
197:50 - the local computer will decrypt it and
197:52 - then it will be able once it decrypts
197:55 - that message it will then take the
197:56 - private key and do something there and
197:59 - then send back a well it won't do
198:01 - something it'll send back a signature um
198:03 - and then that signature will be sent to
198:05 - GitHub and then they'll verify it and
198:07 - that will establish that connection
198:09 - allowing you to use SS keys to get Clon
198:12 - or push or or things like that uh under
198:15 - your account settings SSH and gpg keys
198:17 - is where you'll be able to add the
198:19 - public keys so here you can see I have a
198:21 - couple SSH keys in one of my GitHub
198:23 - accounts and it's there under SSH and
198:25 - gpg keys and when you want to go use um
198:30 - or clone a a repo you're going to really
198:32 - want to use that SSH style address it
198:35 - will not not work with the htps one or
198:37 - the GitHub CLI one technically will work
198:39 - with the GitHub CLI one but that's what
198:41 - you're going going to want to do there
198:42 - so there you
198:44 - [Music]
198:47 - go in this video I just want to show you
198:50 - quickly how to create SSH Keys we did
198:52 - cover that in the quick and dirty uh git
198:54 - crash course but it's good to do things
198:56 - more than once so that we really get
198:58 - good at them I'm going to open up a new
199:00 - environment here in code spaces and
199:02 - we'll get that spun up so I'll see you
199:04 - back here when this is ready okay all
199:06 - right so we have this environment spun
199:08 - up and it's just not remembering myh
199:10 - settings whatsoever but you know that's
199:12 - just how things go and I'm going to make
199:15 - a new folder in here I'm just going to
199:16 - call it um SSH
199:20 - keys and I'm going to just go ahead and
199:22 - make a new readme file so normally what
199:24 - we'll use is
199:28 - the
199:31 - SSH keyen command I realize that's small
199:33 - I'm just going to jump it up like that
199:36 - and so we use t t RSA to make an
199:39 - RSA um uh style key I would imagine that
199:43 - GitHub can support different kinds not
199:46 - that I know much about the different
199:47 - kinds let's go take a look here and see
199:49 - what we can see so that's from local I'm
199:51 - going to go ahead and delete that um
199:52 - because I don't need that right now if
199:54 - we go here you can see things like SSH
199:57 - RSA sha 2 something like that so it be
200:01 - interesting to generate something else
200:04 - out so
200:07 - ecd SSH key key gen ecd
200:13 - so I want to see if we can generate
200:14 - something that's a bit more
200:15 - secure I I assume it's more secure is a
200:18 - relatively new crypto cryptographic
200:22 - solution um it's been around for five
200:25 - years okay so how do we make
200:28 - it and the way we make it is probably by
200:32 - supplying this like that okay great so
200:34 - what I'll do is go back over
200:36 - here and we'll change it from RSA to
200:39 - this one and see what happens I've never
200:41 - done this before but I imagine it's
200:42 - super
200:43 - simple and I'm going to CD into the SSH
200:46 - directory I'm going to go ahead and hit
200:51 - enter say allow yes I want to paste
200:53 - we'll enter and see if it can do
200:55 - this and so we'll go ahead and hit
200:59 - enter um it will create it in the
201:01 - codespace directory so I suppose that's
201:05 - fine and we'll do that and that and so
201:08 - then we're going to get that key and
201:10 - then the idea is that we can
201:13 - then go ahead here and then we could go
201:16 - and cat out the contents of
201:19 - it
201:24 - right all right and so we could copy
201:27 - this and it's actually a lot shorter
201:29 - that's actually really nice I like that
201:31 - and then we could go over here and then
201:33 - we could add it so just say uh Cloud
201:36 - developer environment for
201:38 - CDE and we can add that key now I want
201:40 - to point out that you can add keys to
201:42 - repo as well so we're not going to
201:44 - really test this to make sure it works I
201:45 - just wanted to generate out another one
201:47 - and show you that but what we'll do is
201:49 - we'll go over to our repo because I want
201:51 - to show you where that deploy Keys
201:52 - things is and if we're in a repo like
201:55 - this we can go to our settings and there
201:58 - should be deploy Keys down below and we
202:00 - could add a deploy key and it's the same
202:01 - process you just paste it on in you say
202:04 - what it's from uh you can say whether
202:05 - you want to have right access and boom
202:08 - there you go but a lot of these um repos
202:10 - only need readon so especially if you're
202:13 - building you're just cloning the repo so
202:15 - you don't need that but that's all I
202:17 - wanted to show you so going to go ahead
202:19 - and Commit
202:21 - This okay so we'll just say uh basic
202:25 - instructions for
202:27 - SSH okay so that's all
202:30 - good we'll say
202:33 - okay and then what I'm going to do is
202:35 - just switch into my other accounts and I
202:38 - probably can merge the other way too um
202:40 - if I try that
202:42 - so if we go here to pull
202:45 - requests we go to new pull requests and
202:47 - I could probably try to grab from that
202:49 - other repo so I want to bring in from
202:52 - here from there yep I can do that and
202:54 - then I'm just basically allowing myself
202:56 - to pull the changes and without the
202:58 - other Andrew having to uh Put It
203:01 - Forward
203:03 - okay there we go and we are merged I
203:05 - will see you in the next
203:10 - one
203:12 - so deploy Keys allow you to attach
203:15 - public Keys directly to a git repo and
203:17 - the use case for deploy keys are if
203:20 - you're using let's say a build server or
203:22 - a c cicd thirdparty service that needs
203:24 - to clone the repo so they can perform a
203:27 - build or deploy or maybe single repo
203:30 - access so instead of using a shared key
203:32 - pair for the uh for multiple repos you
203:35 - have a single key pair for a single git
203:37 - uh git repo and another reason would be
203:39 - to avoid using the personal access token
203:41 - um I'm going to tell you I've definitely
203:43 - used deploy Keys especially if you're
203:45 - not using GitHub actions and you're
203:46 - using thirdparty cicd tools which is
203:48 - pretty common with GitHub um you will
203:51 - find yourself using deploy keys and I
203:53 - just want to make a wear that's very
203:56 - similar to the other one with some
203:58 - advantages so you have to decide in your
203:59 - use case where you're going to want to
204:00 - use it but it's as simple as that
204:03 - [Music]
204:06 - okay hey this is Andrew Brown and we are
204:08 - taking a look at personal account access
204:10 - tokens or specifically personal access
204:13 - tokens or Pat which is an alternative
204:16 - way of using a password for
204:18 - authentication now PS are not specific
204:20 - to GitHub but they do utilize them uh
204:23 - and the purpose of these tokens is to
204:26 - give you access to the API um when
204:29 - you're making direct calls or using the
204:32 - command line or using the SDK uh GitHub
204:34 - no longer supports the use uh of using a
204:37 - password directly with interacting with
204:39 - API they used to but now you have to use
204:41 - an access token uh if you're coming from
204:43 - like the adus world it's kind of like
204:45 - your access secret um so it's giving you
204:48 - that access uh there are two types of
204:50 - pths on um GitHub you have the classic
204:53 - token they are less secure and no longer
204:55 - recommended for use customers with
204:57 - Legacy systems may still be using the
204:59 - classic token like some of my apps uh
205:02 - then you have fine grain personal access
205:04 - tokens these Grant specific permissions
205:07 - they must have an expiry date uh you can
205:09 - only access specific repo
205:12 - um or if you want all repos it'll
205:14 - probably only be readon you can only
205:16 - access resources owned by a single user
205:18 - or organization you can find the stuff
205:20 - under the developer
205:21 - settings um there are a few use cases
205:24 - where we'll use uh Pats it'll be like
205:26 - logging in using git clone for
205:29 - HPS and uh let's say we are using uh the
205:32 - GitHub CLI you could set a token or
205:35 - sorry a environment variable called GH
205:37 - token to be used uh for for the GitHub
205:41 - CLI for the to pick that up uh if you're
205:43 - using SDK you're going to be supplying
205:45 - your token I would imagine that this uh
205:48 - that these um sdks would pick up that
205:50 - environment variable as well but there
205:52 - you
205:53 - [Music]
205:56 - go hey everyone it's Andrew Brown and
205:59 - this follow along I want to take a look
206:00 - at personal access tokens yes we've
206:02 - already played around with them but
206:03 - let's play around with them a little bit
206:05 - more okay and so what I'm going to do is
206:07 - go over to my repo and I might already
206:09 - have a code space from before and it's
206:11 - already still active so I'm going to go
206:13 - ahead and open that to save myself some
206:14 - trouble if you have to launch a new one
206:16 - you can absolutely go ahead and do that
206:17 - remember to close your codes places so
206:19 - you are not using up your free tear
206:22 - usage uh you get so many hours per month
206:24 - I don't know what it is uh you can look
206:26 - it up if you want to know or we'll find
206:28 - out when we make it over to the uh code
206:30 - spaces section in the course um and so
206:32 - what I want to do here is I just want to
206:35 - uh work with personal access tokens now
206:37 - we might have one set from before so I'm
206:39 - going to take a look here and see what
206:40 - we have so I'm going type in EnV grep GH
206:44 - and see if there's anything set and
206:45 - there's nothing set here so that's great
206:47 - and what I want to do is go to the top
206:48 - left corner here go to settings and then
206:51 - down below we'll go to our developer
206:53 - settings and we have our personal access
206:55 - tokens we have fine grain tokens and
206:57 - token classic now something I would like
206:59 - to know I'm going go ahead delete this
207:01 - one why I would like to know is can we
207:03 - generate them out from the GitHub CLI
207:05 - You' think you wouldn't be able to
207:07 - because then you need permissions to
207:08 - have permissions but I'm going to take a
207:10 - look here and see what we have have um
207:12 - because I'm just curious to see if it's
207:14 - actually there or not and so I'm going
207:15 - to just type in token and there is a
207:17 - token so it says the this command
207:20 - outputs the authentication token for an
207:22 - account on a given GitHub
207:24 - host well that's really interesting so
207:27 - what would happen if we wrote that in so
207:29 - I'm going to type in GH off token and
207:31 - see what we get and we actually get a
207:33 - token back so I'm not sure if that means
207:36 - that
207:38 - um that's that token code but let's find
207:40 - out if it is
207:41 - by generating out a new
207:43 - token another thing I might wonder is
207:45 - like what permissions do we have I'm not
207:47 - sure if it would tell us I don't think
207:50 - so what's refresh refresh our token
207:53 - expand or fix the permission scope of
207:55 - the store
207:58 - credentials that's kind of
208:01 - interesting like you go out and request
208:03 - to have more permissions but I'm not
208:05 - sure exactly how that would work um but
208:07 - let's go ahead and generate a new token
208:11 - I'll just say um create issues and I'm
208:14 - going to set this for one
208:17 - day okay and we'll go down below and
208:19 - we're going to select it for a very
208:21 - specific repo this one here and I'm
208:24 - going to go to permissions and I'm
208:26 - looking for issues we'll say yes to
208:28 - issues read and write and we'll go ahead
208:30 - and generate that token and so we can
208:33 - see that's what this token looks like
208:34 - we're going to copy it bring it over
208:36 - here and I'm going to set it to this so
208:38 - say GH
208:39 - token equals and then a double quotation
208:42 - paste it in enter and so now it should
208:44 - be set so if I type in E EnV grap uh
208:48 - GH we should see it there excellent so
208:50 - now let's type in Gs off token and see
208:52 - if we get a different value notice that
208:54 - this is the one we have now it shows
208:56 - that we're using a personal access token
208:58 - so this is getting load in loaded in by
209:00 - GitHub how it's getting in there I don't
209:02 - know but this one looks exactly to be
209:04 - the
209:06 - same as this one let's go test and see
209:09 - if we can make an issue so we go down
209:12 - below here and we will say create and
209:15 - I'll scroll down and grab example so
209:17 - we'll do this and hopefully it'll just
209:19 - know to create it in the current repo
209:21 - put enter and we need to set a default
209:24 - repo so we'll go ahead and do
209:26 - that I'll choose this one here and I'll
209:29 - try this
209:31 - again and so it's created
209:34 - it oh this repo has um issues disabled
209:39 - that's interesting so we'd have to go
209:41 - ahead and enable that so I'm going to go
209:42 - back to our repo here I'm going to go
209:45 - over to settings and we'll go down below
209:47 - and we'll turn on issues now we could do
209:49 - this via the CLI but it's just easy to
209:51 - checkbox that and we'll go back to our
209:53 - environment and we'll hit
209:55 - up and now it's created the issue so now
209:58 - the question is if I get rid of that
210:00 - token like I unet it uh what would
210:02 - happen so what I'll do is I'll just hit
210:04 - up till we get to that set and I'm just
210:06 - going to purposely set it blank okay and
210:10 - that way this shouldn't work
210:12 - work and so now if I do GH list issues
210:16 - list I wonder if I can get a list of
210:18 - them now remember this repo is public so
210:22 - it's going to work because it's public
210:23 - but the question is can I delete the
210:25 - issue so I'm going to say
210:28 - delete and um it's expecting some args
210:32 - if I type help will tell me how this
210:35 - works the number of it that's perfect so
210:38 - the number is two so that's easy and and
210:41 - I wonder if I could just put a two on
210:43 - this type two to confirm
210:46 - yes okay and deleted it now the thing is
210:49 - is that yes I was able to delete it but
210:52 - just understand that this thing has some
210:54 - base uh access underneath that original
210:56 - token and so it probably had permissions
210:58 - this one here to do that there's
211:00 - probably some things that this thing
211:02 - can't do and we learned that before
211:04 - which was that uh being able to create a
211:06 - repo um but uh you know if I did this on
211:09 - Local Host I would assume that this
211:10 - would have not worked and that's totally
211:12 - fine I think that satisfies us for
211:14 - learning about uh personal access tokens
211:17 - I'm going to go back to our personal
211:18 - access token go ahead and delete it and
211:21 - we'll call this one done okay so I'm
211:25 - going to go ahead and go into personal
211:26 - access tokens and delete
211:29 - this and if you want you can stop and
211:32 - delete your code spaces I'll see you in
211:34 - the next one
211:36 - [Music]
211:39 - ciao let's talk about the GitHub API and
211:43 - specifically what I want to talk about
211:44 - is the fact that there are two versions
211:46 - of it we have the rest API and the
211:49 - graphql API I'm not going to do a big
211:51 - lesson into what apis are and uh that
211:54 - kind of stuff but I want to give you
211:55 - comparison between these two to
211:57 - understand what are the pros and cons of
212:00 - each of them so let's do a breakdown
212:01 - quickly here uh so the first thing is
212:03 - the design philosophy so for the rest
212:05 - API this is resource base and this is uh
212:08 - this means that usually with rest apis
212:10 - you'll have a different endpoint per
212:12 - resource uh for graphql you'll have a
212:14 - single endpoint with queries for precise
212:18 - data requests um for methods we can use
212:21 - get post put delete um but for graphql
212:24 - they usually use post for data fetching
212:26 - we can have multiple requests for
212:28 - related data for graphql you use a
212:30 - single single request that can be very
212:32 - complex but you get whatever you want uh
212:35 - you can have over fetching or under
212:36 - fetching for graphql you you have
212:39 - precise data fetching so you're getting
212:41 - exactly what you want and nothing more
212:43 - for performance it is less efficient for
212:45 - complex systems but you know what I
212:48 - think that is something we could argue
212:49 - because I still really like rest apis
212:52 - for graphql uh it's more efficient for
212:54 - complex queries for caching it's easier
212:56 - due to HP methods um for graphql it's
212:59 - more challenging due to post methods the
213:01 - learning curve it's super easy as rest
213:03 - apis graphql uh requires a lot more
213:06 - knowledge to pick up um for rest API
213:09 - it's server driven structure for graphql
213:12 - it's client driven okay for versioning
213:15 - you often have to do API versioning for
213:17 - rest API for graphql usually don't have
213:20 - to that was the huge reason for having
213:22 - graph graphql apis the ecosystem for
213:24 - rest API is mature with extensive tools
213:27 - graphql is still growing but uh the
213:30 - point is is that GitHub has both and
213:33 - these are the two big flavors of apis on
213:35 - the internet um and I think the major
213:38 - reason they did graphql was when they
213:39 - opened uh the G ithub App Store so you
213:42 - get exactly the data you wanted because
213:43 - the rest apis didn't always return the
213:45 - data uh that that people needed to build
213:48 - apps and I think that was the reason why
213:50 - because I remember trying to build an
213:51 - app when the App Store first came out
213:52 - and I had to use graphql in fact I
213:54 - learned graphql because of GitHub uh
213:56 - because they're one of the early
213:57 - adopters of it when it came out but
213:59 - there you
214:00 - [Music]
214:03 - go hey this is angrew brown in this
214:06 - video I want to show you the GitHub API
214:09 - um you know there reason I know the
214:11 - GitHub API is because I've before GitHub
214:14 - actions and all this other stuff you
214:15 - would have to interact with a lot more I
214:17 - need to point out that there are two
214:19 - types of apis the rest API and the
214:21 - graphql API I wonder if it could give us
214:23 - an example of what that looks like for
214:25 - GitHub so you have an idea if you've
214:27 - never seen a graphql
214:29 - API um but uh let's see what we can find
214:32 - out so it looks like there might be some
214:34 - way to interactively
214:36 - explore it here oh there we go so
214:39 - graphql um it has it own syntax language
214:41 - and the idea is that you are formulating
214:43 - what data you want it'll turn it back so
214:46 - we can sign into this and then we could
214:48 - probably do some live stuff now I'm not
214:49 - saying I'm good at graphql but I'm sure
214:52 - we can figure it out so go ahead and
214:55 - authorize that and so here it says query
214:57 - viewer login so it looks like we already
214:58 - have some kind of query that's showing
215:01 - who is logged in um so what I would like
215:03 - to do is figure out how to query more
215:06 - stuff um and I'm going to go ask chat
215:08 - gbt because it's such a powerful tool
215:10 - and let's go ahead and figure this out
215:11 - so I'm going to go back over here and it
215:14 - uh we'll
215:16 - say
215:18 - write a
215:20 - graphql query that will return public
215:24 - repos uh for the uh named
215:29 - Ruby um
215:31 - for
215:33 - GitHub graphql API and let's see if it
215:36 - can do this this is a great feature if
215:39 - it can do this for uh this for us here
215:42 - because I do not like figuring out how
215:43 - to write graphql and so here is a query
215:46 - that is writing that we could possibly
215:48 - use okay I'm assuming that's part of the
215:51 - language those three hyphens and we'll
215:53 - go back or periods and we'll paste it in
215:56 - and see if it can
215:58 - work oh look at that okay it worked so
216:01 - there you go that is a way that we could
216:03 - use graphql graph is a lot more hard
216:05 - than just this because you actually have
216:07 - to have some kind of tool um or
216:10 - interface in order to utilize it but
216:12 - yeah it's as simple as getting the data
216:14 - back that you want there is public data
216:16 - and then there's data that needs to be
216:17 - authenticated you have rate limits for
216:19 - certain stuff so understand that you
216:21 - can't just get everything that you want
216:23 - let's go over to the rest
216:25 - API and I'm not sure if they there's
216:27 - ways to interact with it but sometimes
216:29 - what they'll do is they'll make it
216:30 - really easy for you to interact through
216:32 - here on the left hand side so if we went
216:33 - to
216:34 - issues and let's say we wanted to list
216:37 - things we might have some examples and
216:39 - we might be able to run them
216:41 - um so here you can see we have like the
216:44 - GitHub CLI but what we're really looking
216:46 - for is how do we do it raw like how can
216:48 - we do this um using curl or maybe even
216:51 - JavaScript but let's go ahead and do
216:53 - curl because that's more like API is and
216:56 - we'll have to open up a code space for
216:58 - this I think I already still have mine
217:00 - running again try to shut yours down as
217:02 - much as you can so you're saving money
217:05 - um I'm not worried about it I'm teaching
217:06 - a course I'm just going to expense it so
217:09 - understand that I'm a little bit more
217:11 - loose with this kind of stuff the
217:12 - question is will there be a curl command
217:15 - pre-installed In This Cloud developer
217:16 - environment sometimes they don't like
217:18 - like installing those in here for you
217:20 - but this one does have it so we'll go
217:22 - ahead and copy this command curl and
217:25 - we'll go back over here and we'll paste
217:27 - it in we'll hit enter now this isn't
217:29 - going to work because we didn't provide
217:30 - it an access token so let's go
217:34 - over I'm sure you know this by now we'll
217:36 - go over to our personal access tokens
217:39 - and get it going so all the way down to
217:41 - the ground developer settings personal
217:43 - access token find gr permissions create
217:45 - a token only
217:47 - issues uh
217:49 - issues so this is for rest API we're
217:53 - going to set this for one
217:55 - day that way if you forget it's not a
217:58 - big deal and we'll say for um all repos
218:02 - I guess it doesn't matter I'm going to
218:04 - go here and I want to grab oh we can't
218:06 - do it for that let's say all
218:08 - repos and I want issues
218:11 - uh read and write we'll generate that
218:14 - token out I'm going to grab this token
218:17 - I'm going to go back over to here and I
218:20 - need to kind of assemble it somewhere so
218:22 - I need a scratch Pad really quick just
218:25 - put that here I'll paste that in and
218:27 - what I'll need to do is just go above
218:31 - here and insert this I'll grab
218:34 - this paste that in here okay I'm going
218:38 - to cut this out and paste this back
218:42 - in so now we should be able
218:45 - to utilize this so let's see if that
218:48 - works copy paste and so we don't get any
218:53 - issues back now that doesn't mean that
218:54 - it didn't work it just means that
218:55 - there's no issues for it to find and we
218:58 - really don't have any issues so what I'm
218:59 - going to do is go ahead and create one
219:01 - just say uh my
219:04 - issue I think originally when you
219:06 - created issues you weren't able to
219:07 - delete them but now I think they've
219:08 - changed that and you can um so I want to
219:11 - try that again if I hit up will it bring
219:12 - the whole command yes it will and we're
219:15 - still not seeing anything now that
219:17 - doesn't mean that it's not working it's
219:18 - just that uh it's not getting exactly
219:21 - what I want back so maybe we can specify
219:23 - a very specific
219:25 - issue it says a list of
219:28 - assigned this issues assigned to the
219:30 - authenticated user now there's none
219:32 - assigned to us so let's go back and um
219:35 - assign it to ourselves okay so we'll try
219:38 - that maybe that will help we'll hit up
219:41 - and there we go so now we're getting
219:42 - data back and it must be that issue so
219:45 - that's all I really wanted to show you
219:46 - there we'll go ahead and delete
219:49 - this
219:51 - okay there's some way to delete this
219:55 - uh they really don't like you deleting
219:58 - them there it is down below in the
219:59 - bottom right corner and that's all I
220:01 - really wanted to show you for the apis
220:03 - but most of the time you're going to be
220:04 - interacting with some kind of CLI this
220:06 - is in JavaScript um or sorry SDK um but
220:10 - we'll we'll see that in the next video
220:12 - okay
220:13 - [Music]
220:16 - ciao let us take a look at the GitHub
220:19 - sdks and I told you octocat would make
220:22 - another appearance because their uh sdks
220:25 - are called octo kits these are the
220:27 - official sdks to programmatically
220:29 - interact with the git rest API and
220:32 - GitHub officially supports a few
220:34 - different languages so we have
220:36 - JavaScript and typescript c.net Ruby
220:39 - which is my favorite langu language so
220:40 - we're absolutely going to use that and
220:41 - terraform so here's an example of using
220:44 - terraform to uh create a repository as
220:47 - infrastructure is a code should you use
220:49 - terraform for uh GitHub for certain
220:53 - things yes like repos uh for other
220:55 - things like issues no but just
220:58 - understand that sometimes terraform
221:00 - gives you functionality uh that really
221:02 - shouldn't be used and it's up to you to
221:04 - figure out for your use case here's an
221:06 - example using Ruby and make note that we
221:08 - are passing the access token the the Pat
221:11 - Uh to the client um but yeah there we
221:15 - [Music]
221:18 - go hey this is angre brown and this
221:20 - follow along I want to take a look at
221:21 - the sdks so we can probably use Ruby and
221:24 - JavaScript those are both very easy to
221:25 - use uh so what I'll do is go ahead and
221:28 - launch my code spaces I already have one
221:31 - running uh you might have to make a new
221:33 - one you might already have one running
221:35 - make sure you don't leave them running
221:36 - because they do cost money and so it
221:38 - still has some stuff open from prior it
221:40 - probably still has the GitHub access
221:42 - token but what I want to do is go take a
221:44 - look here and type in GitHub
221:46 - sdks and we'll take a look at what we
221:48 - have because there's a couple that we
221:50 - have we have U Ruby JavaScript
221:52 - typescript c c um and they should be
221:55 - really easy to work with so I know
221:58 - they're called octokit so I'll just type
221:59 - in ocit GitHub and that probably will
222:01 - get us to the repo for all of them there
222:03 - we go and so we can get to our Ruby one
222:06 - o terraform let's do terraform and
222:08 - JavaScript let be too hard let's do
222:10 - terraform first because I I'm really
222:12 - excited to do that one and in order to
222:15 - do this we're going to have to have
222:16 - terraform installed so that's something
222:19 - that I I'm going to want as a feature um
222:22 - so for
222:23 - [Music]
222:24 - our Dev container we're going to have to
222:27 - get that feature installed and I'm not
222:29 - sure where we can find that so I'm very
222:32 - curious if like we get a list of
222:36 - features um list of Dev
222:41 - container features GitHub code spaces
222:44 - because there has to be one for
222:48 - terraform and so I'm just searching here
222:50 - for
222:53 - features available features
222:57 - here okay container Dev features that's
222:59 - how we found it and uh just because
223:01 - we're doing a little bit more here I'm
223:03 - going to go ahead and make a folder
223:04 - we'll just say
223:08 - sdks
223:11 - and I'm just going to say file new
223:14 - readme.md we'll go ahead and paste that
223:17 - on in here um and we'll just
223:23 - say we can uh install the
223:28 - following features into our codespace
223:33 - environment just called
223:35 - codespace and so what I'm looking for
223:37 - here is the terraform CLI so go ahead
223:40 - and do that and it's right here so I'll
223:42 - go ahead and grab that and we'll go back
223:45 - over to our Dev
223:46 - container and um I'll put a comma and
223:50 - we'll do this put colon c uh cures so
223:55 - that's that one uh while we're here I
223:56 - wouldn't mind Ruby do we already have
223:58 - Ruby installed let's go take a
224:00 - look type in clear
224:03 - Ruby they might already have it
224:05 - pre-installed in the base
224:07 - image uh if it is it shouldn't take that
224:09 - long to run it is okay so we don't have
224:12 - to install Ruby do we have node I think
224:15 - so yeah we do okay so we don't have to
224:17 - install that so really we just need um
224:20 - terraform now terraform uses get or
224:23 - sorry uh go but they're all compiled so
224:25 - I don't think we need to install go onto
224:28 - this image if we needed it so I want to
224:30 - get this terraform CLI installed so I'm
224:32 - going to go ahead say install terraform
224:37 - CLI we'll go ahead and Commit This
224:40 - and then what we're going to need to do
224:41 - is rebuild this environment so go down
224:44 - below go to command pallet I'm going
224:45 - look for
224:46 - rebuild um I don't know if we need to do
224:48 - a full or a whatever I'm going to do
224:51 - that
224:53 - one that seems fine to me let's go ahead
224:55 - and do that and I'll see you back here
224:57 - when this is done building okay all
225:00 - right so it rebuilt that was really slow
225:02 - but it is done so that is good um I'm
225:05 - not sure if we ran into any
225:07 - [Music]
225:08 - issues oh come
225:11 - on it's currently running recovery mode
225:13 - due to configuration error what do you
225:14 - mean to configuration error I did
225:16 - exactly what you told me to do it's like
225:18 - literally one line and I'm not allowed
225:20 - to do it okay so let's find out what the
225:22 - issue is um control shift
225:25 - p I do not like I do not like
225:31 - uh
225:32 - view code
225:34 - spaces okay let's find out what the
225:36 - problem is now we'll go down
225:38 - below
225:41 - um what's your
225:46 - problem it's not even like easy to find
225:48 - the problem here I'm just going to zoom
225:49 - out for a second so I can find it
225:55 - quicker okay looks fine
226:01 - finished error up
226:04 - here
226:06 - um Docker build fail to build
226:14 - okay but
226:16 - why it just failed to
226:29 - build no space left on the
226:33 - device well then how am I supposed
226:35 - to all right so I was hoping that we
226:38 - could install it that way if that's not
226:39 - going to work that's totally fine I'm
226:41 - just going to go ahead and comment that
226:46 - out okay so we can just do this for
226:50 - now and I'll take that out because I
226:53 - don't want to fiddle with this all day
226:55 - we can just install terraform CLI um the
226:57 - usual way
227:01 - okay I'm going type in clear and so I
227:03 - know it's in recovery mode I really
227:05 - don't care we'll just try try to proceed
227:07 - forward and do what we can so we'll go
227:09 - ahead and install the terraform CLI but
227:12 - you think with all that stuff it just
227:14 - work it would work right uh
227:19 - install and we're going to get started I
227:22 - just want the terraform CLI install
227:27 - instructions if we go
227:29 - here um we need Linux and we're choosing
227:32 - Ubuntu so we're basically going through
227:34 - all these commands it's that stupid gpg
227:36 - I really hope that we don't have to do
227:38 - that um I find that really frustrating
227:40 - so I'm not sure if I can work around
227:42 - that I think I have to get the dev
227:43 - container working let me go figure it
227:45 - out I'll be back in a second okay I'm
227:48 - not sure what would fix it but like this
227:49 - looks right to me I don't feel like
227:51 - we're doing anything wrong so what I'm
227:52 - going to
227:53 - do is I'm going to stop this workspace
227:56 - completely I'm just going to launch it
227:58 - again and see if we get any errors and
227:59 - we probably will don't have to fiddle
228:01 - around with it but uh I mean this is the
228:03 - experience of code spaces so I don't
228:06 - sure what uh why get would want us ever
228:10 - to use these things but I'm going to go
228:11 - ahead and delete this delete and I'm
228:15 - going to wait a moment here I'm going to
228:17 - go back here to our
228:19 - repo I'm going to try to launch it again
228:21 - I'm going to see if it makes any kind of
228:24 - difference okay we'll try this
228:28 - again if it doesn't work I'm going to
228:29 - just use git pod I'm I'm not even going
228:31 - to try with GitHub code spaces but we'll
228:33 - see if it builds okay all right so I'm
228:35 - back and I mean there was no error so
228:37 - maybe it did run out of space I'm not
228:39 - exactly sure how that works um I'm not
228:41 - sure why it would run out of space but
228:43 - that's totally fine I'm going to go
228:45 - ahead and open that up there and I want
228:47 - to see if terraforms installed so I'll
228:48 - type in terraform and it is so that is
228:51 - really good so in our um our SDK
228:55 - directory I'm going to just make a
228:56 - couple new folders so we'll have one for
228:58 - terraform we'll have one for Ruby and
229:01 - we'll do a very simple example with
229:03 - JavaScript as well okay we'll just say
229:05 - JS and so for our terraform one here I'm
229:08 - going to make a new main do TF file
229:10 - because that is how you create
229:12 - terraform and everybody should know
229:14 - terraform because it is a great thing to
229:16 - learn okay we'll type in clear I'll go
229:19 - into terraform here and the idea is that
229:21 - we will want to fill some stuff in so
229:24 - over here they're saying there is a
229:25 - terraform
229:26 - provider and the way that works is it
229:29 - will link over to the registry so um if
229:32 - we go
229:33 - here we'll get to the terraform registry
229:36 - for terraform we can get it on the
229:37 - homepage as well by just going to
229:38 - provider
229:39 - and there's probably one here for GitHub
229:42 - if I type in GitHub if it doesn't show
229:44 - up we could probably just search it um
229:48 - GitHub right and so they should have
229:52 - one I thought that'd be a lot easier to
229:54 - find but apparently
229:56 - not but that's okay we'll click back and
229:59 - I mean this is one way to find it and so
230:01 - the way you use a provider is you're
230:02 - going to grab this over
230:05 - here and we'll paste that into the
230:08 - top we'll say
230:10 - allow and what we have here is the
230:13 - required providers and then any kind of
230:15 - configuration in terraform they'll
230:17 - usually tell you how to configure that
230:19 - in the the first block here um and so
230:22 - I'm carefully reading
230:24 - here uh it looks like you could use a
230:29 - CLI to
230:30 - authenticate uh you can also pass in the
230:33 - personal access token this way as well
230:36 - so I'm hoping that it'll just pick up
230:38 - the CLI um so I think that's probably
230:42 - our best bet it already has a token
230:43 - technically installed whether it can
230:45 - create a repo is another story because
230:47 - we know we have to create separate
230:48 - tokens for that let's go on the left
230:50 - hand side to resources and there should
230:52 - be something here to create a
230:55 - repo or we could just create a
230:58 - branch and so let's copy this
231:01 - code and we'll go down here below and
231:04 - we'll paste it in and so we have to say
231:06 - what repo's for so this is for the
231:09 - GitHub
231:13 - examples and I want to call this Branch
231:15 - uh sdks okay so now what I can do is
231:18 - type in terraform and
231:24 - it and that'll initialize it then we can
231:26 - type terraform
231:29 - plan okay and it's saying that it's
231:31 - going to create this
231:33 - Branch looks good to me so now we'll do
231:36 - terraform apply I'm just going to type
231:37 - in Auto approve because I don't want to
231:38 - have to hit
231:40 - yes and uh otherwise we just say say yes
231:43 - or no it says that it created that
231:44 - Branch now it created this terraform
231:46 - lock file and some other files in here
231:49 - um I don't want this to junk up our
231:51 - um our repo so I'm making a do get
231:54 - ignore in here and we'll go to GitHub
231:56 - and we'll just say GitHub uh G ignore
232:01 - terraform and in here what we can do is
232:03 - just grab that uh terraform one here and
232:05 - this will make
232:07 - sure that we don't have all the junk
232:09 - that might get committed because we
232:10 - don't want to commit uh a bunch of stuff
232:13 - in here and so this is just going to
232:14 - make our lives a lot easier you can have
232:16 - get ignore files within subfolders so
232:19 - that's kind of interesting if we go back
232:20 - here now it's a lot cleaner that's
232:22 - totally fine let's go take a look and
232:24 - see if that Branch was created so if we
232:26 - go here and uh
232:29 - refresh making sure we're on ours and
232:32 - not the other one there it is okay great
232:35 - and so we can also tear that
232:37 - down so say
232:39 - terraform
232:41 - destroy Auto
232:44 - approve and so that was pretty nice
232:47 - there we go we'll go back we'll check to
232:48 - see if that branch is
232:50 - there it's gone excellent so now let's
232:54 - go ahead and do a ruby example so for
232:56 - Ruby um we need a two files we need a
233:00 - gem file I'll generate it out because I
233:02 - think that's a bit easier so we'll CD
233:03 - into that so say uh bundle a knit to
233:06 - create a gem file I always forget like
233:11 - these few lines here but I think their
233:13 - gem is called
233:15 - octo octo
233:18 - kit and it was their first gem so I like
233:21 - I'm really familiar with uh with that
233:23 - there and so we have that installed
233:25 - let's go take a look and uh at that CLI
233:27 - and see how that works um or sorry SDK
233:29 - so we have the Ruby one here I'm going
233:30 - to go over to this
233:33 - one and they should show some very
233:35 - simple
233:37 - instructions
233:43 - mhm uh they're not showing much but I'm
233:45 - going to go ahead and grab this one a
233:47 - lot of libraries especially in Ruby
233:48 - they'll they'll already assume that uh
233:51 - there's certain um tokens being set so
233:53 - I'm hoping that it'll just pick it up
233:55 - and we don't have to do anything fancy
233:56 - going to make a new file here called
233:57 - main. RB doesn't have to be called main
234:00 - it's just what I'm calling it and then
234:02 - the idea with the client is I want to go
234:03 - ahead and I want to uh try to create a
234:06 - branch so you know they might have like
234:08 - a a
234:10 - um a uh
234:13 - um documentation for that I don't want
234:16 - all this stuff I just want to get to it
234:18 - I want the manual so maybe if I go over
234:20 - here this is what I want and so what I'm
234:22 - looking for here is uh a way to connect
234:26 - or create a branch so I'm going to click
234:28 - on client again I've never looked at
234:30 - this in a long time so I'm just guessing
234:33 - but over here client has a bunch of uh
234:36 - things that we can do on it and so I
234:38 - mean there could be a method here so I'm
234:40 - just going to take a look here and see
234:41 - if we have like
234:43 - branch and it looks like we
234:47 - do I want to create a
234:53 - branch and I mean we do have
234:56 - methods here it says included in
234:59 - repositories so if I go over to this one
235:02 - here we go and I just want to create a
235:05 - branch and say
235:07 - create
235:10 - okay what if I search for create Branch
235:13 - create Branch I'm going try methods up
235:15 - here that might help create
235:20 - Branch I don't know why I can't find it
235:22 - I mean I can find branches it might be
235:25 - it might be the case that there is a
235:26 - thing for branches
235:28 - here there might be like an object for
235:30 - it and then we create off of it I mean I
235:33 - don't see one
235:36 - branches what the heck
235:39 - um I mean it's going to be something
235:40 - under repositories that's for sure so if
235:42 - I go to repositories they have an object
235:45 - here and it has to be something on here
235:48 - so if we carefully look we got Fork we
235:51 - got
235:54 - replace so yeah I'm not really sure so
235:57 - well if I don't know I'll go ask chat
235:59 - gbt and we'll see if they can make the
236:01 - code uh create a branch using the Ruby
236:05 - octokit for GitHub and let's see if it
236:09 - can do it but normally you know I would
236:12 - just go and look for it um but you know
236:15 - it's giving us a really hard time so I
236:17 - don't want to waste a lot of time here
236:18 - looking for
236:20 - it um yeah that probably would be one
236:23 - way to configure it okay that looks
236:28 - fine okay so you create a
236:32 - reference and I guess that makes sense
236:34 - because you're not actually creating a
236:36 - branch you're creating a reference to a
236:38 - a branch and then the branch gets pushed
236:40 - later so I suppose that makes sense um
236:44 - they do configure it up here again I
236:45 - don't know if we'll have to do that but
236:47 - it looks like this is what we're going
236:49 - to want to do here so I'm going to just
236:51 - grab this one I don't know if we need
236:52 - the shaw but I'll grab it
236:54 - anyway and I'm going to go back to this
236:56 - if you don't if you can't find this code
236:57 - I have this repo public so you can just
236:59 - grab it from here um and so it says get
237:02 - the latest Shaw from the base Branch so
237:03 - get the latest commit in main main being
237:06 - the base being the meaning that
237:09 - um and then we'll create a branch from
237:10 - it we'll need to specify our Branch name
237:13 - so we'll go back to this code here I'm
237:16 - going to grab these three lines because
237:17 - they look
237:18 - okay and I'll paste this up above and
237:22 - our Branch here is
237:25 - called I mean again it's going to be
237:27 - different for you but uh this will be
237:30 - Andrew Andrew WC
237:32 - Brown
237:35 - GitHub examples I just noticed that I
237:37 - named this with a lower H but that's
237:38 - that's okay um the branch name is going
237:40 - to be
237:42 - sdks uh the base branch is
237:45 - main must have been pulling from some
237:47 - really old code we'll save that I'm
237:49 - going to go ahead and type in bundle
237:51 - exec installed that's how we install
237:53 - ruby
237:55 - gems
237:56 - okay and it's saying missing file opend
238:00 - for install so maybe we have Ruby
238:03 - install but we don't actually we can't
238:05 - actually install anything so bundle
238:06 - install really oh no no sorry it's just
238:08 - bundle install I didn't mean to write
238:10 - exact that's why and then what we can do
238:12 - is type in exact Ruby main.
238:17 - RB and it should run uninitialized
238:20 - constant OCTA kit because we need to
238:23 - require
238:26 - it
238:28 - octokit we'll save that we'll go ahead
238:31 - and hit up and we ran into an
238:34 - error um it wants faray try to use the
238:37 - middle middleware faray so um install
238:41 - the faray retry
238:44 - gem I think faray is for like apis and
238:47 - then maybe retries like a variation of
238:49 - it I actually don't know but we'll just
238:52 - try this bundle I might install it there
238:54 - we go and we'll go ahead and try that
238:57 - again and now we have a 404 so OCTA kit
239:02 - not
239:06 - found and it's looking at GitHub
239:09 - examples for the commit sha on Main so
239:11 - it's using this
239:13 - path here I'm not sure if we could past
239:15 - that in like that this is not found
239:21 - commits so that's really interesting um
239:24 - I don't really understand why that's
239:26 - happening base Branch
239:29 - main main yep that's right did I spell
239:32 - this wrong at all maybe I did so we'll
239:35 - go ahead and hit up I forgot the S on it
239:39 - we'll try this
239:41 - again and now we'll see what it
239:43 - complains
239:44 - about um 404 not
239:47 - found Andrew WC Brown GitHub examples I
239:51 - really don't trust that I'm writing it
239:52 - correctly so I'm going to go down below
239:54 - here I'm going to grab this
239:58 - exactly and I'm going to go ahead and
240:00 - paste this in
240:02 - here exactly okay I'm going to double
240:06 - check my name make sure it's right
240:07 - Andrew Brown that's right and it looks
240:10 - good to me so I'll try this
240:15 - again still says 404 not found
240:22 - um
240:25 - okay I mean we could try and ask chat
240:27 - gbt maybe it's using like an old API uh
240:30 - one thing we could do is go back to the
240:32 - Ruby OCTA
240:34 - kit here and check the
240:37 - documentation okay okay and in here I'm
240:39 - going to go look under what am I looking
240:42 - for um just trying to find here it is uh
240:47 - this command here so this says create
240:49 - ref off of the client and to be fair
240:52 - like we did we didn't we didn't put in
240:54 - our token yet so that might still be an
240:59 - issue okay so it does have create ref on
241:03 - there and that looks fine
241:11 - okay this one says heads Master this one
241:15 - says ref heads
241:19 - main I don't know if that matters I'm
241:22 - going to take out the ref's part on
241:31 - it well maybe that one's
241:34 - fine back to this
241:37 - one
241:40 - creates ref heads Master for octocat
241:42 - Hello
241:43 - World um just to make this a little bit
241:47 - more clear I'm just going to take this
241:48 - out and and so we can simplify this we
241:50 - say
241:50 - sdks again we just want this to work and
241:54 - this is for this particular
241:57 - repo sometimes simplifying the code
241:59 - going to reduce our issues and I'm going
242:02 - to take this completely out here I want
242:05 - to grab the latest Shaw so if I go into
242:08 - to our commits over here and we're on
242:11 - Main we can go ahead and grab this code
242:13 - here and I'm just going to go ahead and
242:16 - replace it okay and so the idea is that
242:19 - this is going to just rule out a lot of
242:21 - issues that we're having okay and I want
242:25 - to bring this on down like
242:31 - this and so this is going to really
242:33 - simplify this
242:34 - one okay now again we haven't passed any
242:37 - tokens so that could still be our
242:39 - issue and it's still not working I can
242:41 - also take out heads here and see what
242:43 - happens if I do
242:45 - that and no luck so I'm going to go
242:48 - ahead and just take take take another
242:50 - look here GitHub um Ruby SDK create
243:02 - branch and also we could probably check
243:04 - this way as well because well they'll
243:06 - have the JavaScript version but maybe
243:08 - they'll have the equivalent for um
243:10 - creating uh for JavaScript we just look
243:12 - at the Ruby what's really bizarre is
243:13 - they don't have the Ruby example I think
243:14 - they used to but maybe they just stop
243:16 - doing that um get a branch rename a
243:20 - branch I want to create a branch work a
243:23 - branch merger
243:25 - Branch so I guess it's not
243:28 - really any of
243:31 - those and so I'm going to go back over
243:33 - here CU it it looked like it was more of
243:34 - a ref and on the left hand side we're
243:38 - going to look here in the API and try to
243:40 - find it um maybe
243:45 - repositories we'll click into
243:46 - repositories
243:48 - here no we'll click on this one
243:52 - maybe I type in
243:55 - ref create
243:57 - ref
243:59 - no we're not having a whole lot of luck
244:02 - here but hey we're learning about the
244:04 - apis and being able to navigate them
244:07 - that's got to count for something
244:09 - right because it's not going to be under
244:14 - refs pendency graph
244:19 - no actions no because that's going to be
244:22 - GitHub
244:25 - actions um commits
244:30 - no let me go fine I'll be back in a
244:32 - second okay okay all I did in Google
244:34 - type in rest API create ref and then I
244:36 - went to the first one and I think now
244:38 - we're in a good place and there is
244:39 - references it's under git database of
244:42 - all things that's a little bit confusing
244:44 - a git reference is a file that contains
244:46 - the get commit sha etc etc great so I
244:49 - want
244:50 - to create a reference here can I am I
244:53 - zoomed in oh that's why it's so hard to
244:55 - read I was super zoomed in we'll scroll
244:58 - on down here and we have create
245:00 - reference and so this is what I think
245:02 - that we're using right we're creating a
245:05 - reference we have owner repo
245:09 - but they don't have a good example for
245:11 - this so you know if this is not working
245:12 - what I'm going to do is copy the
245:13 - JavaScript one and then we'll work our
245:16 - way backwards to the Ruby one and see if
245:17 - we can get it to work okay so I'll go
245:20 - here I'll just say main
245:24 - JS okay I'll paste this on in here and
245:29 - um you know it's asking for the token
245:31 - again it should really load it in via
245:33 - the environment variables if it's not um
245:36 - I'm really surprised that it's just
245:37 - using a request and it's not using the
245:39 - SDK I don't feel like this is the right
245:43 - one I think this is not the SDK um so
245:45 - I'm going to go and type in octokit JS
245:48 - GitHub and I feel like we're going to
245:49 - get a much better way of interacting
245:52 - with
245:54 - it yeah this is going to make a lot more
245:58 - sense so in here yeah y okay here we go
246:01 - um so what I'll do is I'll go grab this
246:03 - line
246:05 - here that's why it's good to know more
246:07 - than one language because you can always
246:09 - work your way back and try to figure out
246:10 - what the problem is but it's showing
246:12 - octokit here so maybe it is actually
246:14 - using the
246:15 - kit right yeah it is okay so that code
246:18 - is using that U we don't need app
246:20 - apparently not sure what app is for but
246:22 - that's fine uh but I'm really surprised
246:25 - that we have to pass the token that way
246:27 - let's go take a look and see how we can
246:33 - authenticate
246:36 - um
246:38 - I was just like hoping that it would
246:39 - just pick it up by
246:42 - default but I'm not sure about
246:46 - that here they're talking about RB like
246:49 - uh octokit
246:52 - RB
246:55 - um actually this is the Ruby one again
246:57 - so I'm on the wrong page back into this
247:01 - one and yeah meant to be over here I'm
247:05 - looking for
247:06 - Authentication
247:10 - here it
247:13 - is yeah I'm not sure how it picks it
247:18 - up well I guess we'll bring in the token
247:20 - then um what I'll do is I is I'll have
247:23 - to bring in a
247:26 - token so we'll go here we'll go to
247:29 - settings and maybe that would fix the
247:30 - Ruby one maybe that was the Ruby problem
247:31 - the entire time I'm going to go ahead
247:34 - and drop this down find grain
247:36 - permissions I'm delete this old one I'm
247:38 - going to create a new one and I'm going
247:40 - just say uh create Branch just really
247:43 - creating ref that's what we're actually
247:45 - trying to do I'm going to go ahead and
247:47 - go to the next one here and we'll say
247:49 - for select repos this will be for our
247:51 - only repo and we need to go through
247:54 - permissions so I'm looking for
247:56 - references ref
247:59 - database
248:01 - API like where would this be would it be
248:03 - under
248:05 - repositories so I'm going to choose this
248:08 - one I'm going to choose the repo one if
248:11 - I can find
248:12 - it oh it is that one right there read
248:15 - and
248:16 - right
248:19 - um maybe this one because that's repo
248:22 - creation commit
248:25 - statuses I'm just kind of picking a lot
248:28 - so we have a good chance of this
248:31 - working I'm going to go count
248:34 - permissions um don't think I need any of
248:37 - those so I think that's fine I'm going
248:38 - to go ahead and generate this token out
248:40 - I'm going to grab this token go back
248:42 - over to our environment and I'm going to
248:43 - go ahead and set this as export GH uh
248:48 - token and then we'll go ahead and paste
248:50 - this in and do that we'll type in clear
248:53 - we'll do
248:56 - GP EnV GH to make sure that we can uh
249:00 - find that
249:03 - there oh I got that backwards EnV grap
249:06 - GH the token is set and so what I want
249:10 - to do here now is make sure it gets
249:11 - picked up I'm going to test the Ruby one
249:13 - here and just see if it if it makes a
249:17 - difference and uh it does not another
249:21 - thing I might try is go back in here and
249:23 - explicitly set that token I believe we
249:26 - can set that as access token and I can
249:28 - say
249:29 - EnV GH token and so that would be a very
249:32 - explicit way to get it I'll hit up again
249:36 - oh there's no problem now okay so maybe
249:38 - it was a token the entire time like that
249:40 - was the issue so what I'll do is I'll go
249:42 - back over to our repo again that was all
249:44 - just guesswork you know you got to have
249:46 - confidence you got to try
249:48 - things and I'll go over here and drop it
249:51 - down and there it is so that definitely
249:52 - did work um I don't want this Branch
249:55 - right now so I want to go ahead and
249:56 - delete it we can go to our branches here
249:59 - and I'm going to go ahead
250:00 - and delete this
250:03 - branch and I want to delete it again I
250:05 - just want it gone it's gone I think and
250:08 - so now we have our Ruby one working so
250:10 - now we need to get our JavaScript one
250:12 - working and it wants a token as well the
250:14 - way we bring in environment variables is
250:16 - a little bit different um it uses like
250:19 - process so it' be like import process I
250:22 - always kind of forget maybe we don't
250:23 - have to import anything at all um we'll
250:26 - say reference a nvar or like call an
250:30 - nvar
250:32 - in nodejs file
250:36 - example
250:39 - yeah it is processed but do we need to
250:41 - import
250:44 - it
250:47 - uhhuh so I'm thinking maybe we don't
250:49 - need to even import anything for it I'm
250:52 - going to go ahead and try this uh we'll
250:54 - go back over
250:56 - here I'm just going to paste this
251:01 - in GH token and so I'm not confident
251:05 - whether it's getting imported or not so
251:06 - what I'm going to do is do a console log
251:08 - that should print out the
251:10 - token
251:12 - token dollar sign uh or maybe it's back
251:19 - tis I know a lot of languages so I get
251:22 - confused
251:23 - easily um okay so that's in there like
251:28 - that
251:32 - um so here we have the reference it
251:35 - looks like these repl these place
251:38 - holders so we'll have to specify the
251:40 - owner I'm the owner so this is going to
251:41 - be um Andrew WC Brown we'll need to have
251:45 - the shaw so I'll go back over here and
251:47 - grab it from
251:49 - here
251:52 - okay and we'll paste that
251:54 - in this is going to be
251:58 - sdk's I'll put JS so we really sure we
252:01 - know what we're using here uh the repo
252:03 - is going to be GitHub
252:06 - examples okay okay and I'm going to make
252:08 - my way over to that directory uh for
252:11 - JavaScript now I'm going to want the get
252:12 - ignore for JavaScript in particular get
252:14 - ignore JavaScript I didn't do it for
252:16 - Ruby because Ruby doesn't really make
252:18 - that much junk files so it wasn't a
252:20 - serious issue but if you really wanted
252:21 - to you could go ahead and and um grab it
252:24 - if you wanted so go ahead and grab that
252:28 - and we'll go back over here to here
252:31 - we'll say dog
252:34 - ignore and if anyone's wondering I'm
252:36 - like watch watching when my test is
252:38 - going to come up here so I'm just kind
252:39 - of getting nervous uh not because the
252:41 - test is hard I just want don't want to
252:42 - forget about and then miss uh sitting
252:45 - the GitHub foundations certification
252:47 - course so that is now in there so that
252:50 - won't dump a bunch of junk files in when
252:52 - it adds that I want to add that right
252:53 - away so add the G ignore sometimes it
252:56 - won't take effect unless you add it
252:58 - right away I know I spelled that wrong I
252:59 - don't care um and so I'm going to go and
253:02 - type in mpm install I'm going to imagine
253:06 - that this is OCTA kit as
253:08 - well it has to be CU it was called
253:11 - octokit JS sometimes like the files
253:13 - might be a little bit different like
253:14 - octokit hyphen period JS or JS after it
253:18 - I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to
253:20 - do an mpm install oh it's already
253:22 - installed but and so what we'll do is go
253:24 - over here and take a look and we now
253:27 - have a package Json and I want to run as
253:30 - I don't know why I didn't put it in here
253:31 - but I want to have a script in here I'm
253:34 - going to go ahead and just type in mpm
253:35 - init because it really didn't give me a
253:36 - whole lot I really don't like that I
253:38 - didn't get stuff here and so it
253:41 - overwrote it and I'm going to just
253:43 - install it
253:46 - again and that way I don't have to
253:48 - fiddle with it so much so now I have the
253:50 - scripts and I can just say start and
253:53 - what I'm going to do here is just say um
253:57 - node main
253:59 - JS okay and so now put a Comm on there
254:03 - we should be able to do mpm uh start and
254:06 - that should try to run that screen R um
254:08 - it didn't like the import for some
254:10 - reason to load es module types um you
254:13 - have to load something something so I
254:15 - think it's just the style that we're
254:16 - using there that's totally fine I'm
254:19 - going have to go to the top here and
254:20 - change this to be require I guess um
254:22 - we'll go back to our JavaScript
254:24 - here we going to go all the way to the
254:27 - top and I need a different way to import
254:29 - it
254:31 - um this one is what we
254:33 - want it could be the node version that's
254:35 - installed here but I really don't think
254:37 - that's the case but I'm going to go
254:39 - ahead and do that that's easy enough to
254:41 - fix and we'll hit
254:44 - enter and a weight is only valid in
254:46 - async functions at at and the top level
254:49 - bodies of
254:51 - modules okay I mean I really don't care
254:54 - if it's a uh async can I just take it
254:57 - out will that
254:59 - work the token printed out that's good
255:02 - um we'll go back over here see if our
255:04 - Branch created just Refresh on branches
255:07 - it did perfect great so now that means
255:10 - we can go ahead and Commit This just
255:12 - double triple check your files make sure
255:14 - you're not committing anything you're
255:15 - not supposed to commit don't commit your
255:17 - token go ahead and Commit This I'm just
255:19 - in a hurry for my exam and we'll just
255:21 - say SDK stuff
255:23 - SDK GNA go ahead and commit that I'm
255:27 - going to say okay sync sync sync I'm
255:30 - going to go back over here I'm going to
255:32 - switch
255:33 - accounts I'm in a big hurry uh you know
255:36 - stop your code spaces don't waste your
255:38 - money and um I'm going to go over to our
255:42 - repo here um and I actually want to be
255:45 - in an exam Pro one exam
255:47 - proo exam Pro
255:55 - Co okay I'm G to make a new PLL request
255:58 - I want to
255:59 - merge
256:01 - um compare across forks and I want to
256:04 - grab this one and bring it over into
256:06 - that one
256:09 - boom just sdks sdks I really shouldn't
256:13 - be silly like that you should take take
256:15 - time naming your pull requests and wait
256:18 - a moment merge it we're done I'll see
256:21 - you in the next one
256:26 - ciao hey it's Angie Brown and we are
256:28 - taking a look at GitHub desktop so this
256:31 - is a standalone application to interact
256:33 - with GitHub repos without the browser or
256:35 - via code
256:37 - and it can do common git and GitHub
256:40 - operations that you can perform via the
256:42 - guei for an easy to ous experience it
256:45 - works for both Mac OS windows and Linux
256:49 - so yeah it's a very useful tool um you
256:51 - know when you look at git as uh a thing
256:55 - that you can use a lot of times there
256:56 - are these other kind of um Standalone
256:59 - applications specifically around get to
257:01 - make git actions easier but this does
257:04 - two things it does git and GitHub so if
257:07 - very powerful if you are using the
257:08 - GitHub platform so I recommend you give
257:10 - it an install
257:12 - [Music]
257:15 - okay hey this is Angie Brown and this
257:17 - follow along I want to take a look at
257:18 - installing GitHub desktop and see what
257:21 - we can do with it so what I'm going to
257:23 - do is open up a new tab and just type in
257:24 - GitHub desktop and we'll find our way
257:27 - over there so here it is uh at desktop.
257:30 - github.com and we can go ahead and
257:33 - proceed to install this so I'm on
257:35 - Windows right now so I'm going to go
257:36 - ahead and just just download that okay
257:40 - all right so that's finished downloading
257:41 - let's go ahead and install it so it
257:42 - should be pretty straightforward going
257:44 - to double click the executable if you're
257:46 - on Mac of course you drag into your
257:48 - applications for Linux I have no idea
257:50 - but imagine it's not too hard to install
257:53 - and I'm just waiting for it to um uh uh
257:57 - pop up here and proceed with
257:59 - installation so you can see my computer
258:00 - is
258:02 - thinking there we go it's starting to
258:04 - open
258:05 - up
258:07 - all right so we'll wait for that to
258:08 - finish its install there we go looks
258:10 - like it's installed we can log in either
258:12 - into github.com or GitHub Enterprises
258:15 - let's go ahead and uh log into
258:17 - github.com you can see we can sign into
258:20 - uh either or I think I'm interested
258:22 - right now in this repo here so I'm going
258:24 - to select this one and we'll go ahead
258:26 - and authorize it um and it says when
258:28 - your phone is ready click the button
258:30 - below so I'm going to use GitHub mobile
258:32 - to confirm because we have UFA so just
258:34 - give me a moment and while I'm waiting
258:35 - here I guess I have to press press the
258:37 - button I wasn't doing that and so it
258:38 - pops up with 14 and um I have a pseudo
258:41 - request and so I'll just share my screen
258:44 - here for just a moment but what it's
258:46 - showing me here is I have to enter those
258:48 - two digits in so that's what I mean
258:49 - where sometimes it it uh pops up or
258:51 - other times it's just confirmation it's
258:53 - going to really depend on the action
258:55 - that's being performed let's go ahead
258:56 - and open this up in GitHub desktop and
258:59 - we can see it's setting our name and
259:01 - email so it's like it's it is
259:02 - configuring get underneath um so that is
259:05 - interesting there we'll go ahead and uh
259:06 - click
259:07 - finish and I mean we got tutorials and
259:10 - other stuff here but I'm not really
259:11 - interested in that I just want to open
259:12 - up the repo that we already have let's
259:14 - go ahead and open that up and I guess
259:17 - we're cloning it and it's actually
259:18 - showing us that we're going to clone it
259:19 - in a specific location here it's putting
259:21 - in documents GitHub I guess that's fine
259:25 - uh we go over to GitHub github.com I
259:28 - suppose we can just select the repo and
259:29 - it'll put the path there so there's two
259:31 - different ways that we can do it here
259:32 - I'm not sure which way is better but
259:34 - I'll go ahead and do uh this method here
259:36 - because it just seemed a little bit
259:38 - simpler and so now we have our repo
259:40 - pulled up and so we can perform stuff
259:42 - here um so you uh you have changes on
259:45 - this Branch would you like what would
259:47 - you like to do with them uh to
259:48 - contribute them to the parent
259:51 - project um I I don't know I just I just
259:54 - opened it up why am I already getting to
259:55 - asked questions you have changes on this
259:57 - Branch would what would you like to do
259:58 - with them to contribute to the parent
260:00 - project for my own purposes this will
260:02 - help you contribute to this repo I guess
260:05 - the top one maybe it's just trying to
260:07 - tell me what I want to do or not do I'm
260:08 - not exactly sure um but now we have this
260:11 - opened and so the idea is that if we
260:13 - make changes we can do something in here
260:15 - looks like we can also open up our repo
260:17 - directly here in Visual Studio code so I
260:19 - can go ahead and click this I guess the
260:21 - nice part of this is that I don't need
260:22 - to have any compute attached um in order
260:25 - to work with this so normally you have
260:27 - to have get installed here and just say
260:29 - I accept this and so we could go in here
260:31 - I'll go into our crash course here I'll
260:33 - just add another exclamation
260:35 - mark
260:37 - if it ever lets me here
260:39 - good I'll just say
260:41 - save and I'll go back over to here and
260:44 - it shows that we have a change uh let's
260:46 - take a look at history so we have um
260:49 - history over time I would really prefer
260:52 - a graph I'm not sure if they actually
260:53 - have like a graph mode in here so this
260:55 - isn't like super useful a lot of other
260:58 - uh git programs like there's one called
261:01 - cracken like get
261:04 - Kraken um
261:07 - they say it's a legendary tool I think
261:08 - it's a little bit heavy but the point is
261:10 - is that they will have a much better
261:12 - visualization in terms of what is going
261:13 - on so you know this tool is okay but
261:18 - it's not the best tool you can create uh
261:21 - you can push pull fetch you can view
261:23 - stuff here you can open up the command
261:25 - prompt um so there are some things you
261:27 - can do you can do stuff with branches um
261:29 - but it's really up to what workflow
261:31 - you're working in because of course you
261:33 - know if you're already using visual
261:34 - studio code you don't really need this
261:35 - tool because we can do
261:37 - uh everything and much more here and
261:39 - then there's also a GitHub plugin that
261:41 - we can utilize so um you know GitHub
261:44 - desktop existed before Visual Studio
261:46 - code and before the visual studio code
261:48 - extension so um you know it's there and
261:51 - you know maybe if you're using a
261:52 - different editor or or maybe you
261:55 - couldn't install the extension or
261:57 - something like that there' be a use case
261:58 - for GitHub desktop again it's not bad
262:00 - but um you know it is it is what it is
262:03 - uh it is very good at keeping uh your
262:05 - repos in a particular location and
262:07 - managing managing them so that is really
262:09 - good there but again why they haven't
262:11 - added a visualization I have no idea but
262:13 - there you go that is GitHub desktop um
262:16 - as far as as much as we want to cover it
262:18 - here and we'll see you the next one
262:20 - [Music]
262:23 - ciao let us compare the difference
262:25 - between github.com and GitHub desktop
262:28 - for the following uh comparisons so
262:31 - let's start at the top here so for
262:32 - github.com it is a webbased interface
262:35 - access via the browser the GitHub
262:37 - desktop is a standalone desktop
262:39 - application for
262:40 - accessibility the github.com is
262:42 - accessible anywhere there is internet
262:44 - and the GitHub desktop is only where you
262:46 - install it on your computer for repo
262:48 - management it directly manages
262:50 - repositories online for GitHub desktop
262:53 - it manages repos locally for basic git
262:57 - operations github.com performs
262:59 - operations like Fork start and watch
263:02 - GitHub desktop um simplified interface
263:05 - for commit pull uh push and so notice it
263:08 - says Fork star and watch those aren't
263:10 - really git operations those are GitHub
263:12 - operations I just want to clarify that
263:15 - um for collaboration direct
263:16 - collaboration tools like issues and PRS
263:18 - focuses on local repo management um then
263:21 - for Advanced GET features supports
263:23 - Advanced features via commands
263:25 - simplified experience for basic features
263:28 - integration tools integrates with
263:29 - various online cicd tools and limited to
263:32 - local get tools so these are not like
263:34 - hard rules for all of them but um it's
263:36 - just a general distinction between the
263:38 - two but there you
263:40 - [Music]
263:43 - go GitHub mobile is a mobile application
263:46 - you can install on iOS or Android phones
263:49 - to perform readon basic GitHub repo
263:51 - management tasks it can manage triage
263:54 - and clear notifications read review
263:56 - collaborate on issues and PLL requests
263:57 - edit edit files and PLL requests search
264:00 - for browse and interact with user repos
264:02 - and organizations receive a push
264:04 - notification when someone mentions your
264:06 - username search through codee in a
264:09 - specific repo secure your github.com
264:11 - account with two Factor authentication
264:13 - and that is the primary reason I tell
264:14 - you to install it is for that as it I
264:17 - find it very useful verify your signed
264:20 - in attempts on unrecognized devices
264:23 - GitHub mobile can be used for UFA which
264:25 - is a convenient way over other methods
264:27 - and I definitely agree with that for
264:29 - everything else you know I'm not really
264:30 - sure I think the thing about this
264:32 - particular product um and I really
264:34 - should have highlighted this is it's
264:35 - really good good for triage and people
264:37 - that need to stay um uh stay up to date
264:42 - with what's going on so people that
264:43 - maybe they a sis Ops administrator or
264:46 - something like that um so GitHub mobile
264:48 - becomes very very important and um even
264:51 - though it doesn't show up in the exam
264:52 - it's in the exam guide outline they
264:54 - really want you to know about mobile
264:55 - notifications to stay on top of stuff so
264:56 - we'll look at that next
264:59 - [Music]
265:02 - okay let us take a look at mobile
265:04 - notifications on GitHub just understand
265:06 - that these are the settings on Android I
265:09 - have no idea what they are for iOS maybe
265:11 - they're different maybe they're the same
265:12 - I would imagine they're the same but
265:13 - different UI but we just want to make
265:15 - sure we cover our bases because the exam
265:17 - guide outline wants us to know this
265:18 - probably for people that try to triage
265:20 - things when issues happen in GitHub so
265:22 - let's quickly look at it so you can set
265:24 - push notifications you want to receive
265:26 - so we can say direct me mentions review
265:29 - requested assigned deployment review
265:32 - pull request review and workflow runs uh
265:36 - you can set the working hours to only
265:37 - receive push notifications for specific
265:39 - periods of time so that way you're not
265:41 - getting annoyed when it's your weekend
265:43 - or it's your time off um you can set
265:46 - swipe options on notifications to
265:49 - perform save Mark is read Mark is done
265:51 - or unsubscribe so you can go left or
265:53 - right on that um you can change the app
265:56 - style notification this might be
265:57 - specific to Android but making sure that
266:00 - you can see the type of alert you want
266:02 - to see so it grabs your attention so you
266:04 - jump on top of it and there you
266:06 - [Music]
266:10 - go let us take a look at the types of
266:12 - GitHub accounts we've got three personal
266:14 - organizational and Enterprise so for
266:17 - personal accounts these are individual
266:18 - accounts with a username and profile
266:20 - they can own resources like reps and
266:22 - projects and actions are taken uh based
266:25 - on the personal account they can either
266:27 - be GitHub free and GitHub Pro which we
266:29 - will definitely describe in this section
266:31 - of the course then you have organization
266:33 - accounts I said organizational above
266:35 - organization can just think of them as
266:36 - the same thing whichever language you
266:38 - want to use shared accounts where we
266:40 - have multiple people collaborating on
266:42 - projects they can own resources just
266:44 - like uh just as the personal account has
266:47 - um and these are generally managed
266:49 - through individual personal accounts I
266:50 - say generally because um when we were
266:53 - going through setting up our
266:54 - organization we have the option to
266:55 - convert our personal account into some
266:58 - kind of business um so we didn't go
267:00 - through that and generally I've always
267:02 - known this to be through personal
267:03 - accounts the exam is not going to test
267:05 - you either either way but I just want to
267:07 - point that out organizations offer
267:10 - different roles with varying levels of
267:12 - access and cons security features those
267:14 - roles are predefined um if you want more
267:17 - flexible custom roles you'd have to have
267:19 - Enterprise for that Enterprise accounts
267:21 - so this is part of the GitHub Enterprise
267:24 - cloud and GitHub Enterprise server these
267:26 - accounts allow for Central management of
267:29 - multiple organizations they're geared
267:31 - towards larger setups needing
267:32 - centralized policies and building
267:34 - management or if you have to have
267:35 - internal G uh GitHub repos which is a a
267:39 - specific type of GitHub repo
267:41 - specifically for Enterprise the exam
267:43 - surprisingly for me ask a lot of
267:45 - Enterprise specific questions which I
267:47 - don't really think is fair for the
267:48 - GitHub foundation so I'm just telling
267:50 - you up front you're going to have to
267:51 - remember some factoids for Enterprises
267:54 - if you want to max out your points on
267:56 - the exam let's take a quick look at
267:58 - GitHub personal and organizations before
267:59 - we move on here so as you can see you
268:02 - get a profile if you look at the top
268:04 - right corner it is based on your
268:06 - username so github.com
268:09 - uhen King there and if you had a repo
268:13 - the repo is going to have uh your your
268:16 - your username followed by the repo name
268:20 - okay for organizations it's very similar
268:23 - it also has a public profile page uh it
268:25 - also has a username and um it's not it's
268:29 - not exactly the same but it's the same
268:31 - concept but it's going to follow the
268:33 - same pattern for uh repos so repos can
268:36 - either have an org name or a username
268:40 - okay so there you
268:42 - [Music]
268:45 - go all right let us compare GitHub free
268:48 - versus Pro and I just want to warn you
268:51 - that the exam might ask you one of these
268:54 - things so it becomes a little bit more
268:55 - important to remember the differences
268:57 - between them is it fair for an exam not
269:00 - really but it's just how they made their
269:02 - exam so I just want to point that out
269:03 - that you have to remember some fact
269:04 - total information here so we have GitHub
269:07 - free and GitHub Pro so let's go through
269:09 - the GitHub free features you get GitHub
269:12 - Community Support dependabot alerts
269:14 - deployment protection rules for public
269:16 - repos two Factor authentication
269:18 - enforcement 500 megabytes of GitHub
269:20 - packages storage 120 g uh GitHub code
269:25 - spaces core hours per month 15 uh
269:28 - gigabytes of GitHub code spaces storage
269:31 - per month GitHub action features such as
269:33 - 2,000 minutes per month deployment
269:35 - protection rules for public repos I'm
269:38 - not sure why it's listed under there
269:40 - because that makes no sense but that's
269:41 - where they put it and so basically um in
269:44 - GitHub Pro you get everything you get in
269:46 - free with addition of GitHub support via
269:48 - email 3,000 GitHub actions per uh minute
269:51 - per month so extra thousand two
269:54 - gigabytes of gig GitHub GitHub packages
269:58 - storage 180 GitHub code spaces core
270:02 - hours per month 20 Gigabytes of GitHub
270:06 - codes spaces storage per month Advanced
270:08 - tools and insights in uh private repos
270:12 - you have required pull request reviewers
270:14 - multiple pull request reviewers
270:16 - protected branches code owners automated
270:19 - link references GitHub pages wikis and
270:23 - repo insights graphs if you don't know
270:25 - what all this stuff is right now do not
270:26 - worry because we're covering basically
270:29 - all of it like working with all these
270:30 - tools and then you should come back and
270:33 - uh review this again so you have it for
270:35 - your knowledge when you take the exam
270:37 - okay
270:41 - ciao for GitHub organizations there are
270:44 - three type of plans we have free teams
270:47 - and Enterprise I put an aster there
270:49 - because this is more an upsell to the
270:52 - Enterprise um uh uh account uh but when
270:56 - you go and you try to buy it will show
270:59 - you their the Enterprise option so just
271:02 - pointing that out let's talk about free
271:04 - so you get everything that was in GitHub
271:06 - free with the addition of Team access
271:10 - controls for managing groups 2,000
271:12 - GitHub action minutes per month 500
271:14 - megabytes of GitHub packages uh storage
271:18 - um and I don't really understand those
271:19 - last two because it is it for the org or
271:21 - is it for the personal account that has
271:22 - the org but it's in there okay then we
271:24 - have teams and this is where we start
271:26 - paying everything from GitHub org in the
271:29 - free edition with also GitHub support
271:33 - via email 3,000 GitHub actions minutes
271:36 - per month 2 gabt GitHub package storage
271:39 - Advanced tools and insights in private
271:41 - repos required pole request reviewers
271:45 - multiple poll request reviewers and
271:46 - notice that the minutes for GitHub
271:49 - actions and packages look very similar
271:50 - to um the pro PL Pro account for the
271:54 - GitHub uh personal Pro and there is more
271:58 - so let's keep going uh we have draft
272:00 - pull requests team pull request
272:02 - reviewers protected branches code owners
272:05 - schedule reminders GitHub Pages wikis
272:09 - repo insights graphs the option to
272:11 - enable or disable GitHub code spaces um
272:16 - one thing I'd like to point out is the
272:17 - code owners because that is quite a
272:19 - unique feature we'll talk about that
272:21 - when we get to wherever that is in the
272:23 - course um but I think that one is one
272:26 - worth remembering out of the teams
272:27 - functionality also draft PLL requests I
272:30 - try to remember those two in particular
272:32 - as those are very specific and unique
272:34 - features and and they both showed up on
272:36 - my exam so just make a note of that
272:40 - [Music]
272:43 - okay all right let's take a look here at
272:46 - GitHub Enterprises deployment options
272:48 - because they have two kind that you can
272:51 - have uh we have GitHub Enterprise Cloud
272:53 - this is when you want to have a hosted
272:55 - version of the Enterprise Edition on
272:57 - github.com and then you have GitHub
272:59 - Enterprise server this is a uh
273:02 - self-hosted one so let's take a look at
273:04 - uh what have our deployment options in
273:06 - terms of feature set on the GitHub
273:08 - Enterprise for both cloud and server
273:10 - they're going to share this same
273:11 - functionality first so first of all
273:13 - they're going to have everything that
273:14 - organization teams has but they're going
273:16 - to get GitHub Enterprise support they're
273:18 - going to get additional security
273:19 - compliance deployment controls
273:21 - authentication with saml uh single
273:24 - signon um and accessing Provisions
273:27 - provisioning with saml and S cim they
273:31 - make a large emphasis on this in the
273:33 - exam in fact I totally thought it didn't
273:35 - matter and then I got a bunch of
273:37 - questions on the sum exam and I was like
273:38 - really but yeah I'm going to have to
273:41 - make a couple slides on that in our
273:42 - Enterprise section because they really
273:44 - want you to know that that is an
273:46 - offering for Enterprise um deployment
273:49 - protection rules with GitHub actions for
273:51 - private or internal repos and that again
273:54 - is a feature specific to Enterprises so
273:57 - make note of that as well we have GitHub
274:00 - connect Actually I don't even know what
274:01 - that is um I'll have to I guess make a
274:03 - slide on that as well option to purchase
274:06 - the GitHub Advanced security so that is
274:08 - a um some kind of additional feature for
274:11 - specific features we have 50,000 GitHub
274:13 - action minutes per month 50 gigabytes of
274:16 - GitHub packages storage a service level
274:19 - agreement of 99.9% monthly up time
274:22 - option to centrally manage policies and
274:24 - building for multiple github.com orgs
274:26 - with an Enterprise account this was a
274:29 - question on my exam as well and I was
274:31 - not prepared for it um they never asked
274:33 - for like minutes I think that's kind of
274:35 - information I never saw that there so
274:36 - you don't have to really worry about
274:38 - that we have options to provision and
274:39 - manage the user accounts for your
274:40 - developer by using the uh
274:43 - emus um I'm glad we never had any
274:46 - questions on of those but uh emus seemed
274:48 - like they're really involved but I
274:50 - imagine that would be in that GitHub
274:51 - administrator um or Administration or
274:53 - administrator certification but there
274:55 - you
274:56 - [Music]
275:00 - go so before we can talk about what
275:03 - markdown is we need to know what the
275:05 - markup language is so a markup language
275:08 - I shouldn't said the but it's a markup
275:10 - language is a way of formatting and
275:12 - presenting Text data in a different
275:13 - format and a common use case for a
275:16 - markup language is to present data in
275:19 - HTML and so uh probably the one that won
275:23 - out the battle for HTML uh formatting
275:26 - language is markdown so markdown is a
275:29 - markup language that provides a
275:31 - shorthand syntax to format information
275:34 - into HTML markdown is popular due to its
275:37 - easy syntax and being readable in its
275:40 - raw format I want to point out that on
275:43 - the exam they might ask you about
275:46 - markdown and they might throw in markup
275:48 - in there to confuse you remember down
275:51 - down down down mark down okay um in
275:54 - terms of file extensions you have MD and
275:57 - markdown I've never ever seen anyone
275:59 - ever use the ladder it's always been MD
276:02 - but just be aware they are both there so
276:04 - let's take a look at what it looks like
276:05 - the idea is you write your mark down it
276:07 - looks like that and from there we're
276:09 - going to get HTML and that HTML can be
276:11 - rendered as a preview so the idea is
276:14 - that we need to learn and everyone
276:17 - should know how to do this not just in
276:18 - GitHub but everyone should know how to
276:20 - write markdown because it's super useful
276:22 - as a developer tool as a Tech Tool in
276:25 - general
276:28 - [Music]
276:31 - okay let us take a quick look at the
276:34 - markdown base basic syntax and so all
276:37 - markdown parsers support uh this basic
276:40 - syntax when we talk about parsers that's
276:42 - a program that knows how to take
276:44 - markdown uh the raw markdown format and
276:47 - spit out HTML and there can be
276:49 - variations between the parsers because
276:51 - there's implementations in different
276:52 - languages for different use cases so
276:54 - understand that uh your markdown might
276:56 - not be the same as someone else's
276:57 - markdown in terms of what will work and
276:59 - not work um but we have headings so
277:01 - that's just your standard headings you
277:03 - have text formatting like size and bolx
277:06 - some of some of the time boltex can be
277:08 - underscores instead of double uh asteris
277:12 - why um they made a tal size single
277:15 - asteris I have no idea as a lot of
277:17 - people think that it's the single
277:19 - asterisk but that's just what it is for
277:21 - Block quotes that's like an indented um
277:24 - uh uh text usually for quotes uh we have
277:28 - unordered list so you just put um
277:30 - hyphens in the front it'll they'll put
277:32 - bullets there for ordered list you can
277:34 - keep all the numbers the same so 11 one
277:37 - and it will then render out as 1 2 3 4
277:39 - which is really nice uh that is for a
277:41 - link that is for an image very similar
277:43 - to link but has an exclamation mark in
277:45 - the front of it you have the horizontal
277:47 - ruler or Rule and then you have inline
277:50 - code I need to really point out that
277:52 - that is using a back tick so when you're
277:55 - doing code blocks they always use back
277:57 - ticks for um for markdown okay so that
278:01 - is the basic syntax and there you go
278:08 - let us take a look here at markdown
278:10 - extended syntax so this will be
278:12 - supported by some parsers if not most um
278:16 - and the most common one is being able to
278:18 - make a table these are not fun to make
278:20 - but at least we can do them uh we have
278:22 - fence code blocks this is when you want
278:24 - to have multi-line code and the really
278:27 - nice thing is that you can actually
278:28 - apply uh for a lot of these um the name
278:32 - of the extension which will provide some
278:34 - synta tax highlighting this is something
278:36 - GitHub absolutely does and you should do
278:38 - it if you have the option to do so
278:40 - because it makes things so much easier
278:42 - to read we have footnotes we have
278:44 - heading IDs which I've never used before
278:46 - we have definition lists which I've
278:48 - never used before we have strikethroughs
278:50 - highlight which I've never used before
278:52 - might be fun to try that out emojis
278:54 - which I love and GitHub has great
278:56 - support for and we have task list which
278:58 - um GitHub this this one's a really
279:01 - useful one then we have subscript and
279:03 - superscript and I've used those in a few
279:05 - cases but uh yeah there you go that is
279:07 - the markdown extended
279:09 - [Music]
279:13 - syntax so in GitHub when you ever have
279:15 - to write something that is markdown
279:17 - supported it's going to have this text
279:19 - formatting toolbar and it allows you to
279:22 - uh utilize GitHub flavored markdown
279:25 - syntax which we'll talk about in the
279:27 - GitHub flavored markdown syntax section
279:30 - and it appears right here and so the
279:31 - idea is that you can uh press these
279:33 - buttons and it's going to make your life
279:35 - a lot easier you also notice that a lot
279:37 - of times you'll have a preview as well
279:38 - so that uh makes it very easy to turn
279:41 - that raw markdown into uh the final
279:43 - product the HTML rendered in terms of
279:45 - what it'll look like to the end user um
279:47 - and so I find that super useful
279:50 - [Music]
279:53 - okay let us take a look at slash
279:55 - commands so these are uh functionality
279:59 - at least within Comon boxes that allow
280:01 - convenience features such as formatting
280:03 - markdown and I'm implying that there
280:05 - could be other functionality but right
280:07 - now it only does a markdown and it's a
280:10 - beta feature oddly enough even though
280:12 - it's a beta feature it appears on the
280:13 - exam because GitHub apparently puts beta
280:16 - features in their exams which I think is
280:18 - bizarre but whatever so let's say you
280:20 - wanted to create a table you basically
280:21 - get this wizzywig and you go through it
280:23 - the idea is that you can put that
280:24 - forward slash to start triggering that
280:27 - um line of prompts and it can make your
280:29 - life a lot easier and actually it is a
280:32 - good idea but um again you know beta
280:34 - feed feature probably shouldn't be an
280:35 - exam but hey that's how GitHub rolls
280:39 - [Music]
280:42 - okay let us take a look here at GitHub
280:45 - flavored markdown also known as gfm this
280:48 - is a dialect of markdown that is
280:50 - currently supported for user content on
280:52 - github.com and GitHub Enterprise gfm
280:56 - provides powerful functionality such as
280:59 - collapsible sections embedded
281:01 - mathematical Expressions embedded
281:03 - diagrams relative paths or linking to
281:06 - files in the same repo task lists that
281:09 - can be converted into issues extended
281:11 - formatting for tables short hands to
281:14 - autol links to issues pull requests and
281:16 - repos render code Snippets from other
281:19 - code bases via linking and more um and
281:22 - we can see the whole detailed spec at
281:24 - gfm spec uh website here so that's at
281:28 - github.com
281:29 - gfm it's a really good read and I'm
281:32 - being sarcastic because it is very dry
281:34 - but let's take a look at the
281:36 - functionality we're listing here on the
281:38 - left hand side so you have a really
281:39 - clear idea what you can do so the first
281:42 - that I think is really cool is having um
281:45 - better syntaxes or sorry a control over
281:48 - your tables so here you can actually
281:50 - have embedded syntax within the table
281:52 - cells which is not a normal thing you
281:54 - can usually do with markdown another
281:56 - thing is more uh control over the look
282:00 - or formatting of your table so you can
282:02 - better align that stuff I imagine that
282:04 - they have like merging cells and uh
282:07 - excluding the headers I think that they
282:09 - have that but um these are the two that
282:10 - I could remember that are a big deal um
282:13 - they have this details tag and this
282:15 - allows you to have collapsible
282:17 - sections uh it has support for mermaids
282:20 - so this allows you to render things like
282:23 - um uh dags di
282:26 - acrylic direct acrylic graphs it's just
282:28 - a type of graph okay um we have geojson
282:32 - and too Json this allows you to create
282:34 - interactive maps so here's an example of
282:37 - geojson and then here's an example of
282:39 - too Json I imagine that they render a
282:41 - bit differently so one might be better
282:43 - than the other in terms of information
282:45 - shown then we can uh render 3D models so
282:49 - that's kind of cool um it can render
282:52 - mathematical expressions and I really
282:54 - know latex I used to work for a math
282:56 - educational startup and so you have your
282:58 - double dollar sign for your latex or you
283:01 - can use uh fencing blocks code blocks
283:04 - and have math this is using math Jacks
283:06 - so if you're wondering what
283:07 - implementation that's what it's using
283:09 - and so those will both render out the
283:10 - same thing based on what syntax you want
283:12 - to use um if you have links it'll
283:15 - automatically be linked that's not like
283:16 - a GitHub specific thing but it is
283:19 - something that um they have set their
283:22 - defaults for their markdown to do but
283:24 - what is really interesting are these
283:25 - quick links so the idea is if we do
283:27 - pound 26 or GH hyphen 26 it'll create
283:31 - hyperlinks and these hyperlinks will go
283:33 - to issues which is super useful um might
283:36 - go for poll requests as well because
283:37 - they usually treat the numbers as the
283:39 - same so like if you make an issue one
283:41 - and you make a pull request the next ID
283:44 - will be two in your project if that
283:46 - makes sense within comments you can
283:48 - quickly link to other repo so if you
283:50 - have something that looks like a repo
283:51 - it's going to go to a repo uh that would
283:53 - be the final product uh produce there
283:55 - and then you can also link Things based
283:57 - on um commit Shaws so yeah a lot of cool
284:00 - linking um Tas list can be uh can with
284:04 - uh can be op can be turned into open
284:06 - issues kind of wrote that a bit weird
284:08 - you can associate tasks to specific
284:10 - issues creating basically subtasks
284:12 - GitHub can keep track of your open or
284:13 - closed state of linked issues you can on
284:17 - click turn a task and associate with an
284:19 - issue so here is your usual task list
284:22 - but notice there's like little icons and
284:24 - stuff um and you can also reorder them
284:26 - so a lot of great additional
284:28 - functionality that is on the rendered
284:30 - side or on the markdown side that is new
284:33 - um but yeah that is gfm you should know
284:36 - some of the stuff because it really does
284:38 - make it a lot easier to work on GitHub
284:39 - but there you go
284:41 - [Music]
284:44 - ciao all right so in this fall along
284:47 - what I want to do is get some practice
284:49 - with markdown there's a few ways that we
284:51 - can uh work with markdown here um we
284:55 - could uh edit files in line we could use
284:57 - GitHub dodev we could open up code
284:59 - spaces but I just want to show you um
285:03 - you know a few things that we can do
285:04 - here so maybe what I should do is go
285:06 - over to our new repo GitHub examples and
285:09 - we should try to uh utilize um some of
285:12 - the abilities of creating stuff without
285:14 - opening up an editor because I know the
285:17 - exam they might ask you that and so I
285:19 - figur a little bit of practice with that
285:21 - would be good so let's say we want to
285:23 - make a new folder here what we can do is
285:25 - we go ahead and add a new file and we
285:28 - will create a new file and in order to
285:29 - create a a new folder all we got to do
285:31 - is type A for slash I'm going to say
285:33 - markdown
285:35 - uh here and put a for Slash and now we
285:38 - have a folder and we now have ourselves
285:41 - a readme file now I didn't mean to hit
285:42 - forward slash there I think it just
285:44 - happened prematurely so I just hit
285:45 - backspace I can type in MD and notice
285:48 - right away that we can start writing
285:51 - markdown okay so we can go here and flip
285:53 - between them they really want to use
285:54 - co-pilot I do not care about co-pilot
285:56 - and I'll go ahead and just say U mark
285:59 - down uh mark down
286:02 - examples and what we'll do is work
286:04 - through some here so again I'm just
286:05 - going to show you that you can commit uh
286:08 - this but let's make a list of things
286:09 - that we should learn how to do headings
286:11 - we should know how to do uh and I'm
286:13 - already writing markdown as a list
286:15 - headings uh unordered
286:19 - lists we should have ordered
286:22 - lists um uh formattings like uh text
286:28 - formatting
286:29 - code uh
286:32 - tables Auto links
286:36 - lists
286:38 - um we could also have like images
286:42 - links images okay so that's a pretty
286:46 - good list of things that we can learn
286:47 - how to do
286:50 - and I think that's a good start so let's
286:52 - see
286:53 - unordered list I'm going to go ahead and
286:55 - commit that change so I just want to
286:56 - show that you can commit directly with
286:58 - files and update files here and that's
287:00 - really really nice and you can see that
287:02 - stuff rendered in place but I think
287:03 - what's going to make this a lot easier
287:05 - to work with is to uh use that
287:16 - github.io so if we press in Period what
287:18 - that's going to do is open up
287:24 - github.com which is not a thing I hit
287:27 - period but it didn't do anything I hit
287:29 - period again and I think it had to like
287:32 - move or something there and now it's
287:33 - going to open open it up in
288:00 - github.com
288:01 - okay so let's go through and figure this
288:05 - out so the first thing are headings so
288:07 - this is a heading up here this is a
288:09 - heading one if we can go we do this this
288:10 - is heading one and now we'll just do
288:12 - heading two
288:14 - headings and I feel like we already kind
288:16 - of figured that out because we're we're
288:18 - doing that so I'm not sure if we really
288:19 - need to have that as we know what
288:20 - headings are so we'll say unordered
288:25 - lists and we'll just uh say
288:29 - unordered lists yeah we can create
288:32 - unordered lists
288:34 - in
288:35 - markdown using
288:38 - hyphens
288:41 - okay and while we're doing this let's
288:43 - open up uh GitHub flavored
288:46 - markdown because maybe there's some
288:48 - things that are there that might be
288:50 - interesting to take a look at so I'm
288:51 - going to go ahead and grab this link I'm
288:54 - going to dump it in remember that just
288:55 - Auto links as soon as we paste it in
288:56 - here and if we go here we could see that
288:58 - there is a bunch of stuff so there could
289:00 - be something for lists I'm not seeing
289:03 - anything for list I can type in list
289:04 - here lists container blocks
289:07 - lists um notice they have a minus or a
289:12 - plus so looks like that breaks it up
289:14 - into separate ones so we can give that a
289:16 - go let's just go ahead and copy these
289:18 - and take a look at what we get so we do
289:20 - this and that will treat this as two
289:22 - separate lists I guess we can have
289:23 - pluses or
289:25 - minuses didn't know that that's cool
289:28 - again these are extensions to uh the
289:30 - regular one and then we can have our
289:32 - unordered list
289:36 - or sorry ordered
289:38 - lists okay so it's interesting that you
289:41 - know you can do one two and then have
289:43 - three but notice if you repeat three
289:45 - multiple times it'll increment from
289:47 - there and it starts from where it
289:48 - incremented um so I think that's really
289:51 - cool you can also just have them all the
289:53 - same number if you want so you don't
289:54 - have to really worry about that but
289:55 - that's a nice way of splitting again
289:57 - never knew that because I never bothered
289:59 - opening this up till
290:00 - now um so there's that uh let's go take
290:04 - a look at uh text
290:11 - formatting so we have let's say bold so
290:14 - if we are supposed to do italics first
290:16 - so italics is going to be
290:18 - this okay scrolling down so we can see
290:21 - it bold just going to do that every
290:24 - single time e bold can be this
290:28 - doubles and see how like formats it as
290:30 - well so you can kind of have an idea you
290:32 - can also probably do bold with
290:33 - underscores I think apparently that does
290:35 - a tal size I guess you can do one or the
290:37 - other so I was kind of wrong but I guess
290:39 - we could do it this or that way not all
290:42 - markdown um parsers do that though some
290:44 - might treat um underscores exclusively
290:47 - as a bold so understand that let's try
290:50 - strike
290:51 - through strike through we have to use
290:55 - doubles for some reason there we go does
290:58 - markdown give us anything or gfm does it
291:01 - give us anything fun we'll go all the
291:02 - way to the top here
291:04 - um characters and
291:08 - lines apparently apparently pays
291:10 - attention to tabs that's
291:13 - cool
291:15 - um yeah not exactly sure but maybe there
291:18 - is something else there some inline
291:21 - stuff so that's fine uh we'll go to the
291:24 - next one we have
291:25 - code so for code here we'll say
291:29 - code what we'll want to have here is
291:32 - stuff like um backtick so we might say
291:34 - um something as like puts hello Ruby so
291:37 - that's how you say that's how you print
291:38 - in
291:39 - Ruby hello world notice that it has this
291:42 - interesting formatting so it's different
291:44 - from like whether we were to bold so if
291:46 - we were to do the same thing it wouldn't
291:47 - be really the same thing right if we did
291:50 - this in
291:51 - bold that's
291:53 - great but take out the back
291:56 - ticks but like this is a lot better when
291:58 - you have something inline so you can
292:01 - print to the terminal
292:04 - using
292:06 - the command so that's really good when
292:08 - you want inline code so say like inline
292:15 - code
292:18 - multi-line code so here I could do
292:20 - triple back
292:23 - ticks it will
292:25 - say without
292:32 - highlighting
292:35 - with
292:40 - highlighting okay so we'll say something
292:43 - like defa hello
292:45 - world
292:47 - and
292:50 - puts
292:52 - hello
292:54 - world I'll copy this I'll bring this
292:56 - down here we'll do RB and so notice this
292:59 - one's highlighted and this one's not so
293:01 - really try to do those High highlights
293:03 - as you can um I think they say like what
293:06 - it's using underneath so there's
293:07 - probably I can't remember what it is but
293:10 - uh they say in the documentation in the
293:12 - getting started like what syntax
293:14 - highlighting program they're using and
293:15 - so you can probably look up these codes
293:16 - but for the most part you can guess I
293:17 - don't know if like I typed in Ruby if
293:19 - that would still work as well it looks
293:21 - to be the same yeah it's the same so
293:23 - Ruby or the extension okay so there's
293:26 - that uh we have tables so we'll go down
293:31 - below here I really don't like making
293:33 - tables but we can try this
293:37 - here we use that text Toolbar to make it
293:39 - really easy but I'm not going to do that
293:43 - um so somewhere here should be tables
293:45 - tables tables tables tables tables
293:47 - tables tables just search tables here it
293:50 - is
293:51 - extension okay so some things are like
293:54 - clear extensions and other things are
293:55 - just like the settings they use as their
293:57 - default so go down here and so this is a
294:00 - basic
294:02 - table okay
294:04 - you always use three for this I'm not
294:06 - sure why but it's always three and you
294:08 - have to follow this
294:10 - format here's something that looks like
294:12 - more about um changing the alignment
294:15 - let's go here make sure we're at the
294:16 - right levels here um so maybe you don't
294:20 - have to have that so cells in one column
294:22 - don't need to match the length Okay so
294:24 - basically you can do whatever you want
294:26 - here and does it stretch it more if we
294:29 - go
294:30 - more no it doesn't so it's say it's one
294:32 - or whatever but standard markdown would
294:34 - only have uh three so that's uh like
294:37 - that's nice that you don't have to do
294:38 - exactly exactly three every
294:41 - time um so that's piped content okay
294:44 - that's
294:46 - fine I see something a little bit more
294:48 - exotic that's kind of interesting so I
294:51 - think it make an empty cell in this
294:54 - case I think I'm missing the one in the
294:56 - front
294:59 - here uh that didn't render
295:02 - out
295:10 - so despite it being in there oh you know
295:12 - this one's missing that's why it's
295:13 - getting
295:16 - confused and this one's
295:19 - missing what if I take this one out no
295:23 - this one just does not render so I'm not
295:25 - sure why they show that as an example
295:26 - because that doesn't render oh it will
295:29 - not be recognized okay I thought for
295:31 - some reason it would be like it leave an
295:33 - empty space let's try this one there we
295:35 - go so we have an empty space in this
295:37 - case but in this case it doesn't so I
295:39 - guess you have to have the full length
295:41 - and if there's one like if you don't
295:43 - have the full length of one then it
295:44 - won't work okay looks like we can just
295:46 - have a
295:48 - heading or is it a body yeah just the
295:51 - heading so I know there's more to it
295:53 - than that but um for whatever reason
295:55 - that's what it's showing up
295:57 - there we could take a look at block
295:59 - quotes um this is kind of interesting
296:01 - I've never seen that much for Block
296:02 - quotes before let's go block quote let
296:04 - so when you're doing like a quote for
296:06 - somebody or like you're making like a
296:08 - note so that's really interesting
296:10 - usually I would just do this like um uh
296:13 - the cloud is amazing right so you do
296:15 - that but here we're actually getting
296:19 - some different levels here I never knew
296:21 - you could do that let's try
296:23 - this block
296:25 - quote okay this one
296:28 - is similar wasn't super exciting there
296:33 - so so yeah that's interesting let's go
296:34 - back to our top we have
296:38 - um block quotes I can't spell block
296:44 - quotes this block quotes and I'll go all
296:47 - the way down to the bottom here or back
296:49 - to the top images images we'll do images
296:52 - and links this should really
296:54 - be over here so something we could do is
296:57 - if we wanted to make a link we could
296:58 - link um let's say we want to uh link
297:00 - this I'm just going to copy this here
297:01 - unordered lists and we could put squares
297:04 - around it like
297:06 - this okay and notice as soon as I hit
297:09 - pound this is specific to GitHub but it
297:12 - can link to the anchors that it sees on
297:14 - the page so if I want to link to this
297:15 - unordered list uh it'd be this right so
297:19 - this would map to that which is really
297:21 - nice so if I click that it would jump to
297:23 - that part of the page okay you can also
297:25 - do relative links to other stuff so if I
297:27 - had like um a file in here and I just
297:29 - say uh
297:31 - secret secret. MD
297:37 - uh we say
297:40 - this secret
297:44 - page if I spelled that right secret
297:49 - secet
297:51 - secret secret okay that other one looks
297:55 - right to me I can't really tell the
297:57 - difference um so you know like for links
297:59 - I just want to link to that so these
298:00 - links are going to be become very useful
298:02 - here in a second
298:03 - so say
298:05 - links so let's try this again Link Link
298:08 - Link Link Link we not have a heading for
298:10 - this yet so I go down here links all the
298:13 - way back to the
298:16 - top links and now I can just jump to
298:19 - that here on the right hand side and so
298:21 - maybe we want to go to that secret page
298:22 - so I'm going to do
298:23 - squares uh parentheses and this is going
298:25 - to be this part is the text I think um
298:29 - secret page and so this goes to the
298:32 - secret page so now what I can do is I
298:35 - could type
298:36 - in um trying to think how I do this real
298:39 - so now see how it's autoc comp
298:40 - completing so if I do this this will
298:42 - actually jump to that right so and I
298:44 - don't think you need that you probably
298:45 - do that as well it would still go there
298:47 - and so this is a great way to navigate
298:48 - around when you have a lot of pages
298:50 - again this is specific to GitHub um so
298:53 - other things might not do that uh we can
298:55 - just put a link out to anywhere here so
298:57 - let's say we want to do um something up
298:59 - to like github.com we say GitHub website
299:02 - and we just type type in
299:05 - htps
299:08 - Colon github.com if something looks like
299:10 - a link it will turn it into a link so
299:12 - that's really nice as well you might be
299:14 - fun to try out that repo thing remember
299:15 - the link and auto links so let's say we
299:18 - did uh issue one I wonder if it would
299:20 - render in here uh it didn't but you know
299:24 - this might be contextual based on where
299:25 - it is so this might only work in
299:26 - comments and I actually think that in my
299:28 - um my slide that's actually what it says
299:30 - is that U it should that it only works
299:32 - in comment so we might have to go test
299:34 - that out here in a moment um so is there
299:37 - anything else that we're missing we
299:38 - didn't do images usually you drag images
299:41 - in here and then they'll they'll they'll
299:42 - populate so I'll show that somewhere
299:44 - else but we'll consider this our
299:46 - markdown stuff here it'll say markdown
299:50 - examples okay the thing we didn't do was
299:53 - I think a list so if I did this I could
299:54 - say like item one can put a space here
299:59 - just say Tas
300:01 - Lisk um double here and say item one
300:05 - item two I'm not sure if it'll work
300:09 - here it's not rendering it that doesn't
300:11 - mean it's not working it just doesn't
300:12 - render here and so we'll go ahead and um
300:15 - just commit these changes make sure we
300:17 - get all of them so I'm just going to add
300:18 - this refresh got them all in here and
300:21 - we'll commit that so let's go take a
300:23 - look at some of the other markdown stuff
300:25 - that we're not going to see here um so
300:27 - what I want to do is go back to this
300:29 - repo so there's a link here I think
300:30 - codes spaces doesn't I think last time I
300:32 - was looking for and I couldn't find it
300:34 - and so what we might want to do is look
300:36 - at an issue and play around with Mark
300:38 - down here so we don't have any issues in
300:39 - this repo right now it's going to make a
300:41 - new issue um and apparently we can link
300:44 - to pull requests and other things like
300:45 - that so I might need to do a little bit
300:47 - more than just what we're doing here but
300:49 - anyway I'll just say um GitHub fun or
300:53 - sorry get or markdown
300:56 - fun learning how to use markdown and so
300:59 - what we could do here is make a list so
301:01 - let's try the forward slash because
301:02 - that's something they want us to know
301:04 - and I mean we could use this for a few
301:06 - different things adds a detail section
301:08 - to hide and show Stu that's kind of cool
301:10 - it drop that in there and we can just
301:12 - say my to-do list apparently has a
301:15 - summary didn't tell us that before and
301:17 - go here see we have this nice drop down
301:19 - um I don't know if we need this interior
301:21 - P but what I want to do is make a list I
301:23 - could try doing forward slash to see
301:24 - what else we have here nothing really
301:26 - interesting you can seert issue
301:28 - templates that's kind of cool right
301:29 - there we'll look at that later but let's
301:32 - try to do this to-do list because that's
301:33 - what I'm really interested in so I'll
301:34 - just say um we'll say
301:39 - lists
301:41 - and
301:44 - headings it's a little bit small I'll
301:46 - bump it up I'm sorry
301:49 - headings
301:51 - and bold and
301:54 - italics and we'll go ahead and submit
301:57 - that issue let's expand that notice that
302:00 - these are
302:01 - now uh we can sort and move this around
302:04 - and we can check these things off um
302:07 - it's probably possible for us to link
302:08 - issues to other issues I'm going to try
302:10 - to make another is again I don't know if
302:11 - this will work but I'll try it actually
302:12 - before we do that let's do it over here
302:14 - so let's say we want to do headings this
302:16 - used to be on the left hand side now
302:18 - they have it on the right whatever we'll
302:19 - click that and it should make a new
302:21 - issue okay so we do that and now it's
302:24 - being tracked I guess so we go over here
302:27 - let's see what happens if we close
302:29 - it say this is
302:33 - maybe we can reference this
302:36 - references um this one here notice that
302:40 - we have a link there for the repo I'm G
302:43 - to try this Andrew WC
302:45 - Brown and we'll say
302:48 - GitHub I'm going try to write it exactly
302:51 - the same here GitHub examples because
302:54 - they said that would link it didn't
302:56 - copyright we'll try that one more
303:00 - time do that again
303:03 - it really does not want to listen here
303:05 - we'll try this
303:06 - again GitHub example so I want to
303:10 - see what we're getting here so this
303:12 - isn't linking how I was hoping it would
303:15 - I mean it says in the docs you can so
303:17 - I'm not making things up here we'll just
303:19 - comment on
303:21 - that okay that didn't hyperlink
303:24 - interesting let's go take a look at that
303:27 - autolinks
303:30 - GitHub
303:31 - okay
303:33 - um this might have been in
303:35 - like gfm getting
303:38 - started I have to kind of remember where
303:40 - that is
303:42 - GitHub and we'll go to this
303:45 - here and I'm looking
303:48 - for where that could be um no no not
303:52 - this not this one
303:54 - um like they had like a getting started
303:57 - for
304:00 - GitHub flavored
304:06 - markdown here here it probably is there
304:09 - we go and so in here they should have
304:11 - things for like autol links I'm going
304:13 - grab this so we don't have to find it
304:15 - later on
304:17 - um I'm just going to modify the file so
304:20 - I have it go back over to our examples
304:23 - here and into our
304:26 - markdown and I'm just going to go ahead
304:28 - and edit this
304:29 - file in line because I'm only making one
304:32 - line change we could do a lot from just
304:34 - here but again it's a lot more
304:37 - um uh efficient
304:40 - to use
304:45 - github.io
304:48 - links
304:52 - links Auto
304:55 - links anyway I know that they're there
304:57 - because I took screenshots and I and
304:59 - like I wherever it was it's somewhere
305:02 - okay maybe it's like Advanced
305:04 - formatting that's probably what it might
305:06 - have been code blocks autol link
305:08 - references okay here we go so in
305:11 - here we should be able to link the
305:17 - repo reference
305:19 - type I didn't understand
305:21 - it over here oh maybe we got to put an
305:25 - issue afterwards okay so maybe we just
305:27 - can't link the repo by itself uh we're
305:30 - saying a very specific repo so I guess
305:32 - that is a minor mistake on my part let's
305:34 - go back to our
305:35 - issues
305:38 - okay good thing we always double triple
305:40 - check things if I go back to this then
305:43 - maybe I do pound and then four on this
305:46 - would that work there we go okay and
305:49 - then it shortens it and then we can see
305:50 - our to-do list here can we check off
305:52 - from here that'd be cool if we could no
305:55 - but uh let's close this issue because
305:57 - what I want to see is does that close
305:59 - that thing out so we go over here and
306:01 - look it says one of four task completed
306:03 - which is really cool um so the question
306:06 - is if we were to check off all these
306:08 - things would this all be
306:10 - done this one this
306:13 - one this one there we go okay um so
306:19 - that's pretty interesting there's a lot
306:21 - of little markdown things that we can do
306:23 - um but I think that is sufficient uh and
306:25 - we have a good idea how to work with
306:27 - markdown um documentation is its own
306:30 - little skill so you know getting as much
306:31 - practice as you can is really great but
306:33 - I'll see you in the next one uh
306:36 - [Music]
306:39 - ciao let's talk about uploading files on
306:42 - GitHub because it's super easy the idea
306:44 - is that you can just drag them into any
306:46 - markdown box and it will generate out uh
306:49 - that image tag we didn't do it in the
306:50 - markdown section because I wanted to
306:51 - leave it for this but what it will do is
306:53 - it will have a placeholder and when it
306:55 - finishes it will then U place a link and
306:58 - basically GitHub is then hosting uh that
307:00 - file that you uploading in terms of what
307:03 - you can upload well there's a maximum
307:04 - file size of 10 megabytes for images and
307:06 - Gifts 10 megabytes for videos
307:08 - surprisingly I didn't know they could do
307:09 - videos uploaded to a repo owned by a
307:11 - user or org of a free GitHub plan 100
307:15 - megabytes for videos uploaded to a repo
307:16 - owned by a user or org on a paid GitHub
307:19 - plan 25 megabytes for all other files um
307:24 - supported files would be PNG GIF
307:27 - jpeg um SVG log files markdown files
307:31 - Microsoft Word PowerPoint Excel text
307:33 - files PDFs Zips and video so there you
307:39 - [Music]
307:42 - go hey it's Andrew Brown and this fall
307:44 - along I just want to show you how to
307:45 - upload files very quickly when you in
307:47 - comments I don't know if this works in
307:49 - uh GitHub dodev I don't think so but in
307:52 - the comment boxes it absolutely will so
307:54 - what I'm going to do is go over to our
307:55 - issues and we're still learning how to
307:57 - use markdown I didn't finish that task
307:59 - and the idea is that we want to have
308:01 - some kind of image so basically what you
308:02 - need to do is download any kind of image
308:04 - I got an image on my desktop right over
308:06 - here and so what I'm going to do is drag
308:08 - it on in and I'm going to drop it in and
308:11 - notice that it's going to replace it
308:12 - with this link format and uh so if I go
308:16 - to preview you can see the images there
308:17 - it say simple as that so that's all I
308:20 - wanted to show you you can also go here
308:22 - and upload directly it'll open up you
308:24 - know your your downloads box but I don't
308:26 - really want to do that I just prefer
308:28 - dragging and that's it see you in the
308:30 - next one ciao
308:35 - hey this is Andrew Brown and let's take
308:37 - a look at the GitHub user profile so for
308:40 - personal accounts you get a GitHub user
308:42 - profile to Showcase yourself as a
308:44 - developer and that seems to be what they
308:45 - want the focus to be as as you uh start
308:49 - using it you kind of get that idea so
308:51 - here's an example of mine on my personal
308:53 - account and let's just walk through the
308:55 - features of this profile so we have a
308:58 - profile picture and bio uh that you can
309:00 - provide there um um notice that the bio
309:03 - is actually this little small tagline
309:05 - that's under your account right here uh
309:08 - we have user profile readme so that is
309:10 - this readme file over here that you can
309:13 - uh put whatever you like in it'll show
309:15 - it'll showcase your repos including the
309:17 - the ones that you've pinned as your
309:18 - favorite you'll have the contributors
309:20 - graph this is a graph displaying your
309:21 - contributors over the past year you
309:23 - might see an exam question on this I got
309:25 - one uh for contributors graph so
309:27 - basically what is it actually showing uh
309:31 - it has commits PLL request issues and
309:33 - cod reviews if you remember that stuff
309:35 - like what's in it then it'll be very
309:37 - easy to pick it out in a lineup you have
309:39 - followers and following so this displays
309:41 - the number of followers you have and the
309:42 - numbers of users you are following I
309:44 - didn't even know I had followers on
309:46 - GitHub but apparently I do you have
309:49 - stars so show repos you have starred we
309:52 - have organizations so list the GitHub
309:54 - organizations you are part of contrib
309:56 - contribution activities detailed list of
309:58 - recent activities on GitHub let's take a
310:00 - look at these features in more a closer
310:03 - view here um so the first thing is that
310:05 - big um uh profile read me and you can
310:08 - have your own all you got to do is
310:10 - create a public repo with the same
310:13 - username and uh the same username as the
310:16 - repo name and the user trying to get my
310:18 - pen tool out here that wasn't supposed
310:19 - to be uppercase you know PowerPoint
310:22 - likes to title titlee stuff all the time
310:24 - but you can see up here this is what it
310:25 - is and then I just have a read me and
310:28 - that's what it's rendering out um so
310:30 - that's pretty straightforward you can
310:32 - change uh your profile photo your
310:34 - display name bio URL in your profile and
310:37 - your social social accounts URL so name
310:40 - bio if you want pronouns URL social
310:42 - accounts choose your public email if you
310:45 - even want to show one uh so there's that
310:47 - there if you're looking for a job you
310:49 - can also say hey I'm looking for work um
310:52 - you can pin specific GitHub repos that
310:55 - best showcase your work so you know if
310:57 - you want to say I made this video came
311:00 - called Swap and pop a long time ago this
311:02 - is like 2016 which was a clone of
311:03 - testers attack so I wanted to Showcase
311:05 - that really good skills or maybe the 100
311:07 - days of cloud that was another project
311:09 - that I had so there's other things like
311:10 - that that you might want to
311:11 - showcase um and it's very easy to pin
311:14 - you just go there and say I want to pin
311:16 - these repos or these gists if you don't
311:18 - know what gists are we'll talk about it
311:19 - in the gist section for uh contribut
311:23 - activity this is going to show how
311:25 - active uh your Prof uh public profile is
311:27 - and so here we are seeing activity I
311:30 - think these are all basically for public
311:31 - rep
311:32 - some people get really creative and they
311:34 - try to um make their activity uh look
311:37 - like a photo I'm trying to find my
311:38 - there's my mouse so they might try to
311:40 - make this look like something and and
311:42 - into artwork by purposely committing
311:44 - they might have like a bot that does
311:45 - that I don't do that but uh that is
311:48 - something that you can do but there you
311:52 - go
311:54 - [Music]
311:57 - okay hey it's Angie Brown and we're
311:59 - taking a look at GitHub user profile so
312:01 - we do have uh this new user I created
312:03 - but I want to show you what mine looks
312:04 - like first because I want to just make a
312:07 - call out uh to something that might show
312:09 - up on the exam and I didn't include in
312:10 - the lecture slides and it honestly threw
312:12 - me off that they even bothered asking
312:13 - this in the exam but uh they might ask
312:16 - you about uh some of the
312:18 - features uh in the profile and one of
312:20 - them is about achievements so I don't
312:23 - know why why they would ever ask this
312:26 - but achievements are things that you do
312:30 - um that you can earn uh uh these
312:33 - pointless badges for doing certain
312:35 - things okay what those things are I
312:38 - don't even know I don't even think it
312:40 - matters but the point is that they have
312:41 - them here and they'll ask you on the
312:44 - exam about achievements for some crazy
312:46 - reason so I wanted to point that out but
312:49 - you have an idea of what my repo looks
312:51 - like or my profile looks like let's go
312:53 - back over to the other account and get
312:55 - set up so we already set up a um a user
312:58 - profile photo for this one and before it
313:01 - was it was showing the old one so we
313:03 - couldn't really see it also I just
313:04 - notice that we can set status here I
313:06 - didn't even know that I don't think I
313:07 - would ever do that this isn't a you know
313:10 - it's not it's this is not a um uh what
313:13 - do you call it a social media platform
313:15 - but whatever they have everything under
313:17 - the sun here but this is now showing up
313:18 - here you've unlocked new achievements
313:19 - with private contributions show them off
313:21 - by including private contributions in
313:23 - your profile in your settings and look
313:25 - hey I'm already getting junk
313:27 - achievements but just understand that
313:28 - they're there um what we can do is pin
313:31 - this here so we can go ahead and say
313:32 - let's pin uh this repository here um
313:36 - apparently we can pin this other one I
313:37 - think it's CU we contributed to it
313:39 - that's why we can pin it I'm going to go
313:41 - ahead and just say GitHub examples and
313:42 - save my own and it was already kind of
313:44 - showing up there but now it's there we
313:47 - can go over to gists for fun and make a
313:49 - new gist and then pin
313:53 - that just say uh
313:55 - hello hello. MD and I'm just going to go
313:59 - here and say puts hello H
314:02 - world and we'll scroll on down and we
314:04 - will create this as a public
314:07 - gist okay I'm going to go back over here
314:09 - I might already show up because we have
314:11 - such few stuff here but I can open this
314:13 - up and I'll pin this and now I have this
314:15 - gist so maybe if you want to like have a
314:17 - read me file and have more information
314:19 - this is actually kind of a smart idea
314:20 - would be to have like two of them up
314:21 - here and pin them I never even thought
314:23 - of that uh let's go uh ahead and get in
314:27 - our uh read me page so we know that if
314:29 - we create a repo with the exact same
314:31 - name we can have that so I'll go ahead
314:32 - and make a new repo I call this one
314:35 - Andrew WC Brown and notice that we get
314:38 - this nice little popup I like the little
314:40 - icon or the uh pixel graphic here this
314:43 - is a special repo okay make sure it's
314:46 - initialized with the read me to get
314:47 - started so go ahead and create a read
314:49 - me and that's now there if we go over to
314:53 - our
314:54 - profile okay it's there so pretty
314:58 - straightforward not much else to say
315:00 - there um there you go okay we'll see you
315:03 - in the next one
315:04 - [Music]
315:07 - ciao let's quickly talk about readme
315:10 - files these are markdown files that
315:12 - provide documentation and structional
315:13 - information and a repo a GitHub repo
315:16 - that has a readme.md or readme and all
315:19 - caps or read me and all caps with. MD in
315:22 - the projects rout will be rendered on
315:24 - the homepage there's actually some other
315:26 - markdown files that will also be
315:28 - rendered there but it's really important
315:30 - to remember the read me one as it will
315:32 - probably come up as an exam question and
315:35 - they'll actually ask you like what uh
315:37 - where where should this be located it's
315:39 - always in the root that's what's going
315:40 - to render I don't think it renders
315:42 - anything else but that one and they
315:44 - might kind of trick you there um you do
315:46 - get this nice little table of contents
315:47 - on the right hand side so if you have uh
315:49 - headings it will figure that out for you
315:52 - there I remember that wasn't there
315:53 - before so that's really nice um but yeah
315:55 - it's as simple as that
315:57 - [Music]
316:00 - okay so GitHub wants you to know about
316:02 - basic repo navigation what that means I
316:05 - don't really know so I'm taking my best
316:06 - guess to show you what that is uh So
316:09 - within a GitHub repo you will have a
316:11 - navigation bar with various features of
316:12 - your GitHub repo and this is how you get
316:14 - to all the cool stuff and the main one
316:16 - is code this is where your code's going
316:18 - to live um such as files folders things
316:21 - like that um we have issues that's for
316:23 - tracking problems it's basically a
316:25 - ticket tracker we have pull requests
316:27 - that's where we're going to be uh uh
316:30 - when we're managing collaboration with
316:31 - other developers and they want to bring
316:34 - changes into our repo it's our
316:35 - opportunity to check that work before it
316:37 - gets merged in we have actions that's
316:39 - for GitHub actions uh for projects
316:42 - that's for GitHub projects uh for wikis
316:44 - that's the wiki security is like a a
316:47 - list or a um a checklist of things that
316:50 - you should do I think it changes if you
316:52 - are looking at the context of a uh as a
316:56 - a user and you're not the owner of the
316:57 - repo you're going to see maybe the
316:59 - security policy or different information
317:01 - but if you are the owner you're going to
317:03 - have a checklist of things you should do
317:04 - and it basically mirrors kind of what's
317:06 - in the settings page under security so
317:09 - it's kind of weird that they do that but
317:10 - that's how they do it then we have
317:11 - insights this provides uh statistics
317:14 - mostly in the form of charts and graphs
317:17 - about the repo sometimes this
317:18 - information is public sometimes it's
317:20 - private then you have settings this is
317:21 - where you control all the settings for
317:23 - your repo um the other thing is that
317:26 - when you are using at least in the code
317:28 - section you can navigate around files so
317:31 - I showed showed you this in a a prior um
317:33 - follow along but the idea is you can
317:35 - search stuff you can see the contents of
317:37 - file you can comment on code per line so
317:41 - there you
317:43 - [Music]
317:46 - go so when you create a repo you can
317:49 - choose which owner you want it to be so
317:51 - right now I have it set as uh my
317:53 - personal account but you could drop that
317:55 - down and you could also choose an
317:57 - organization that you belong to repo
317:59 - names are scoped B based on the account
318:03 - so you can have the same name uh for
318:05 - different organizations other people can
318:06 - have the same name if they're a
318:08 - different user so just understand that
318:09 - you can do that uh you need to choose an
318:12 - available GitHub name again based on
318:14 - that scope uh your repos can either be
318:16 - public or private um pretty
318:19 - self-explanatory you can quickly add a
318:21 - readme file a do get ignore and license
318:23 - it's very very important to remember
318:25 - those three because you might get an
318:26 - exam question asking about the three
318:28 - things that you can quickly and easily
318:30 - add if you're using the CLI you can add
318:33 - it uh this way or create one we did this
318:35 - earlier when we did the GitHub CLI kind
318:38 - of demonstration and we found out that
318:39 - repos require special additional
318:42 - permissions or personal access token
318:44 - permissions um that the GitHub Cod
318:46 - spaces would not allow you to do but
318:48 - yeah there you go that's a creat a
318:50 - [Music]
318:53 - repo all right let's go ahead and create
318:56 - ourselves a repo I know we already know
318:58 - how to do this but it gives us an
318:59 - opportunity to talk a little bit more
319:02 - about uh some of the things that might
319:03 - appear on the exam you can create one up
319:05 - here in the top right corner and I have
319:08 - this double click problem so it's
319:09 - getting a bit confused I can go to this
319:11 - new green button that's usually what I
319:12 - do and we can have a new repo so I'm
319:13 - going to say my uh cool repo right we
319:17 - can provide a description um this repo
319:20 - is amazing and we can set it as public
319:22 - or private I'm going to stick with
319:25 - private for now and we'll add a read me
319:28 - we'll drop down to get ignore we'll say
319:29 - may we're working with Ruby so we'll get
319:30 - that by default and we'll add a license
319:32 - like MIT we go ahead and create that
319:35 - repo um I want to point out that you
319:38 - have other things that are rendered here
319:40 - so that should be very clear um we have
319:43 - releases and packages which we should
319:44 - talk about at some point I'm going to
319:46 - leave this repo around if we want to
319:48 - play around with it um but uh yeah it's
319:51 - pretty clear how to create a repo it's
319:53 - not hard let's go take a look at a more
319:54 - popular repo like Ruby on Rails um so
319:57 - I'm just going to type this up here and
319:59 - type in rails and we'll take a look and
320:00 - see what they have um so if we go into
320:03 - here you'll notice there are just more
320:05 - things we have codes of conduct right we
320:07 - have our MIT we have our security policy
320:11 - if we go up here to the security tab
320:14 - this is what we can see um so we have
320:16 - the security policy being rendered out
320:17 - here and then it's showing um possible
320:21 - uh exposures probably based on one of
320:24 - the scanners I'm not exactly sure which
320:25 - one is showing that um but that is that
320:29 - there if we go back to our own repo we
320:31 - might be able to take a look at security
320:33 - here hold
320:34 - on uh going back to wherever that one
320:39 - was we just made that repo it can be a
320:42 - little bit of pain to sometimes find
320:43 - your own repos I'm not sure why they've
320:44 - never made that easier but just how it
320:46 - is and if we go down we can find my cool
320:49 - repo here and there's this security Tab
320:53 - and notice that it's listing out uh
320:55 - things that you should do for your repo
320:57 - it's important to know what these are
320:59 - because um
321:01 - well if you have this uh the exam is
321:04 - going to probably ask you like what's
321:06 - what things can you access from here and
321:08 - this is just from the public repo if you
321:09 - have a private repo it's going to be
321:10 - different sorry this is private public
321:12 - can be different so let's just open this
321:14 - up and make a comparison and see if what
321:16 - kind of difference there is here so if
321:18 - we go over to repo here and we go into
321:20 - this public one over here what options
321:24 - do we
321:25 - get so we get a lot more going on here
321:28 - so notice that this is the price private
321:31 - and that is the public probably because
321:33 - if you're if you had a paid version You'
321:35 - then get additional code scanning and
321:37 - secret scanning for public repos you
321:39 - automatically get that stuff I just want
321:41 - to point out that all this stuff is also
321:43 - under your settings under uh Security
321:45 - Options so they kind of just like repeat
321:48 - it there you know so it's just what they
321:51 - do but hopefully that makes sense and
321:53 - that's all I wanted to show you so I'll
321:54 - see you in the next one
321:56 - [Music]
321:59 - ciao let's talk about maintaining a repo
322:02 - now what's unusual about this slide
322:05 - content It's Not Unusual but it's the
322:07 - fact that in the outline they have a
322:10 - whole section for GitHub Administration
322:12 - and uh for whatever reason I have it
322:14 - over here as opposed into the other
322:16 - section because of the way the outline
322:17 - is designed so understand that I'm not
322:19 - going to cover that stuff in that other
322:21 - section because it's just repeated um
322:24 - but anyway let's continue on and look at
322:25 - maintaining repo so the first thing is
322:27 - your name so you can change the name of
322:28 - the repo if you do not like it as long
322:30 - as the name is available you can
322:32 - absolutely do that and a reminder that
322:34 - repo names are scoped based on personal
322:36 - or organizational accounts or
322:37 - organization accounts I I keep writing
322:40 - organizational but it means the same
322:41 - thing uh you can change the base Branch
322:44 - the default Branch uh you can rename it
322:47 - um just so you know Maine is the
322:48 - unspoken best practice for naming your
322:50 - base Branch everybody does it the old
322:52 - one was Master nobody calls it Master
322:54 - anymore um you can opt in and opt out of
322:57 - some features for your GitHub repo I say
323:00 - some as a catch all just in case there's
323:02 - features that do not show up or there's
323:04 - ones that are locked in um but that's
323:06 - pretty straightforward you just check a
323:07 - box and you might have to do some
323:09 - additional configuration then there's
323:10 - the danger zone which contains actions
323:12 - you need to think twice about because
323:15 - they cannot be undone if you make a big
323:17 - mistake and in the danger zone we have
323:20 - the ability to change the repo
323:21 - visibility um it's important to
323:23 - understand what happens when you make a
323:26 - a a repo from private to public the code
323:28 - will be visible to everyone who can
323:30 - visit at github.com anyone can Fork your
323:32 - repo all push rule sets will be disabled
323:36 - your changes will be published as
323:38 - activity now will this show up in the
323:40 - exam probably not I didn't see it but
323:42 - that is something to consider um you can
323:44 - disable Branch protection rules uh so
323:47 - Branch protection rules are strict
323:48 - workflow rules uh uh that just like will
323:51 - do something like disallow someone from
323:53 - pushing to Main and uh you can
323:56 - temporarily disable them if you have to
323:58 - apply quick fixes and you can't work
324:00 - around those r rules easily you can
324:02 - transfer ownership to somebody else and
324:03 - they'll become the owner of the repo you
324:06 - can archive the repo so it becomes read
324:08 - only you can delete the repo so there
324:10 - you
324:11 - [Music]
324:14 - go all right time for some repo
324:17 - maintenance uh so what we're going to do
324:20 - is I want to create a new repo I'm going
324:22 - to make it in my other account uh just
324:24 - because we're going to want to transfer
324:25 - from one to another but I'm going to go
324:27 - here and just say um uh under here Omen
324:31 - King and I'm gon say my cool repo 2 okay
324:37 - and I'm gonna just make this private and
324:38 - I'm going to add a read me here um I'm
324:41 - going to go ahead and create this repo
324:43 - okay so now that this is repo created we
324:45 - can go over to our settings and let's
324:47 - say I didn't like the name two I need it
324:48 - to be three because we already have
324:50 - another one called two in the other
324:52 - account I'm going to rename that and it
324:54 - renames before we used to rename it used
324:56 - to take time now it's instantaneous
324:58 - which is really really great if we
325:00 - scroll on down we could change the main
325:02 - branch we could change the name to main
325:04 - two um there are some uh limitations
325:07 - there because it's not showing all of
325:09 - our options as we don't have other
325:11 - branches apparently it doesn't create it
325:13 - instantaneously but it will change it in
325:16 - a bit of time there it is so I think it
325:18 - has taken effect if we go here and yeah
325:21 - it shows that it's been renamed so that
325:23 - sounds really good we're going to go
325:25 - back over to settings notice that we can
325:27 - checkbox and uh checkbox on and off
325:30 - features let's let's get rid of issues
325:31 - let's get rid of projects if we go over
325:34 - here to our code notice that they have
325:35 - vanished across the top so that is great
325:39 - we'll scroll on down um we have more
325:44 - abilities somewhere here in the danger
325:46 - zone so we can change our visibility it
325:48 - will give us a warning about it I'm not
325:50 - sure why it's making it so hard I'm
325:52 - going to make this public I'm going to
325:53 - say that I I accept the changes and
325:55 - we're going to make it public and then
325:57 - apparently I have to confirm so I'm
325:59 - going to get out my phone and it wants
326:00 - me to enter a number into my
326:05 - phone okay so 37 approve
326:09 - great and I'll wait a moment for it to
326:12 - take effect there we go so now it is
326:14 - public um we can disable our Branch
326:17 - rules so I'm going to go ahead and do
326:19 - that uh we can go ahead and transfer
326:23 - this repo I'm going to send it
326:25 - to um a specific person so this is going
326:28 - to
326:29 - be I want to send it
326:32 - to Andrew WC Brown which is the other me
326:37 - and then I got to type in the repo name
326:39 - so we'll go ahead and do that my cool
326:42 - repo 3 I
326:45 - understand okay so now it should be
326:48 - transferred
326:52 - um and I think the other person has to
326:54 - accept so I don't think it's
326:55 - instantaneous so if we go over
326:59 - here h
327:01 - do I have the repo now if I go up here
327:02 - in my
327:03 - notifications how do I see the repo
327:10 - transfer I'm not sure I'm going to go
327:12 - check the email for this account and see
327:14 - if it shows up there okay all right so
327:16 - in my email we can see over here that uh
327:19 - there is a repo transfer link so I'm
327:21 - going to go ahead and click
327:22 - [Music]
327:26 - that GitHub repo templates is a feature
327:28 - for public repos that allows other
327:30 - GitHub users to make a copy of the
327:32 - contents of the template repo to use as
327:34 - a starting point for their own repo and
327:37 - I believe it's only for public I I
327:38 - haven't checked for private but I don't
327:40 - know why you'd want to use it for
327:41 - private we set a uh a repo as as a
327:45 - template by checking box on the template
327:48 - repository and then you'll have this
327:50 - option to use the template and when you
327:52 - click use this template it will then ask
327:55 - you to choose a new name and it'll say
327:57 - what do you want to include and then
327:59 - it'll show that that was generated from
328:01 - that other template I use these in my
328:03 - boot camps because I will create a
328:05 - starter project and then you will start
328:08 - from that template how are these how is
328:10 - this different from cloning or forking
328:12 - um the idea here is that um you're
328:15 - starting with a clean repo you're not
328:16 - having all the baggage of of stuff that
328:19 - comes with it it is a really clear clean
328:22 - repo and so that's how you're going to
328:24 - go ahead and uh utilize it but that use
328:26 - case that I explained for which is like
328:29 - you know you want to have something like
328:31 - a project that people are going to start
328:32 - as a basis of that's where going to be
328:34 - using repo templates okay
328:36 - [Music]
328:39 - ciao hey it's Angie Brown and this fall
328:42 - along we'll go ahead and make a repo
328:44 - template so um we have
328:48 - here um let's go over here to our other
328:52 - repo trying to find
328:54 - it sometimes it's a bit hard to navigate
328:56 - repos there we go that's a bit better
328:58 - and so we have this my cool repo what I
328:59 - want to do is convert this repo into a
329:02 - public repo for now just so that we can
329:04 - utilize this feature I want to go to the
329:05 - top and see if we can make a template
329:07 - actually it looks like we can I'm really
329:09 - surprised because what would be the
329:11 - point if um it's private you know what I
329:14 - mean because we go here how's anyone
329:16 - going to click that button it doesn't
329:17 - make any sense so I really think that
329:19 - that is a public feature and notice I
329:22 - actually checkbox it on and it turned
329:23 - off so I think it
329:25 - is yeah it is nope okay it's on
329:28 - now all right
329:31 - I mean I guess you could use it to make
329:33 - your own from it so I guess my thought
329:37 - was it was always about other people
329:38 - using it but I guess you could make your
329:39 - own default template and use it for
329:41 - yourself so I guess it's not just a
329:43 - public feature but they're never going
329:45 - to ask you on the exam so I'm not going
329:46 - to fix the slides because of that let's
329:48 - go ahead and uh create a new repository
329:51 - from this template and we'll just say my
329:54 - cool repo 2 and we'll make it private
329:57 - and also we can include other branches
329:59 - but I don't want anything else
330:01 - and there we go so now we have this uh
330:04 - repo that is making a copy of we'll give
330:06 - it a moment and here it is you can see
330:08 - it's generated from that one and there
330:11 - you go
330:13 - [Music]
330:16 - ciao so in GitHub you can clone a repo
330:21 - programmatically three different ways uh
330:24 - we have the first which is https uh you
330:27 - will have to supply a GitHub username
330:29 - and password on the clone and you'll
330:31 - need to set uh get to cach the
330:34 - credentials if you don't want to keep
330:35 - entering them in I didn't write it in
330:37 - here but when it says password we're
330:39 - talking about the um personal access
330:42 - token because GitHub does not let you
330:45 - use passwords anymore um but in the
330:47 - documentation it kind of suggests that
330:49 - you can use a password because it says
330:51 - password protected oh not here but under
330:53 - here would it would it would say that um
330:56 - for
330:56 - SSH uh you can utilize that method
330:59 - you'll have to have an SSH key pair and
331:02 - you'll have to upload that to your uh
331:04 - GitHub account then we have the GitHub
331:06 - CLI um so we can do that as well this is
331:10 - going to use credentials uh when you do
331:12 - GitHub login it'll actually use either a
331:14 - personal access token or SSH we can also
331:17 - clone repos in the GitHub desktop and we
331:20 - can just download a zip it's not really
331:21 - cloning but we can download the contents
331:23 - of it um so that's pretty
331:26 - straightforward there sometimes you just
331:27 - want the the the codes repo um I want to
331:31 - point out that we did all this in the
331:33 - quick and dirty git and GitHub crash
331:36 - course so if you're wondering how to do
331:39 - these three make sure you have watched
331:41 - that video and you've done it all okay
331:43 - see you in the next one
331:45 - [Music]
331:48 - ciao you can add files to your GitHub
331:51 - repo directly via the GitHub UI if you
331:54 - drop down code you or sorry add file
331:56 - you'll have create new file or upload
331:58 - files so it's great for both text and
332:00 - binary files um and uh the idea here is
332:04 - that when you uh go ahead and add a file
332:06 - if you need to have folders you can put
332:08 - a for Slash and it will end up creating
332:11 - as many folders as you want and then you
332:13 - put the name in and you just create that
332:15 - file there when adding multiple files
332:18 - that you also need to edit you can also
332:19 - quickly use
332:30 - [Music]
332:34 - there are lots of ways of creating
332:35 - branches in GitHub and git um something
332:39 - that you should really know how to do is
332:41 - to use this single line command get
332:42 - checkout hyphen B to both create and
332:45 - check out a branch in one go you should
332:48 - absolutely know how to do get push
332:50 - hyphen U origin staging which is
332:53 - basically The Hyphen U is short for
332:55 - hyphen hyphen setup stream I know it
332:57 - looks like a single hyphen there but
332:59 - there's actually two
333:00 - uh for this flag you can create branches
333:03 - from issues um and then the branch and
333:06 - issue will be Associated and linked you
333:08 - can directly create branches in the
333:09 - GitHub UI you can create branches in the
333:12 - GitHub desktop and I'm sure you can
333:14 - create branches in the GitHub CLI and uh
333:17 - yeah there you
333:19 - [Music]
333:22 - go hey it's Angie Brown and this fall
333:24 - along I want to create some branches
333:26 - nothing super difficult to do but um
333:29 - something that will take us just a
333:30 - moment I'm going to go ahead and use um
333:33 - our my cool repo and what I want to do
333:37 - here is I want to go ahead actually I
333:38 - want to clean these up I don't want to
333:39 - have a bunch of uh junk repos hanging
333:42 - around so actually I decided against
333:45 - that and I just want to keep things
333:46 - clean and keep with our single repo even
333:49 - if it is U public so I'm going to go
333:51 - ahead and type my cool repo here and
333:54 - clean this up Andrew WC
333:58 - Brown or man geez Andrew WC
334:03 - brown brown my cool repo it's that
334:06 - autocomplete that's messing it up there
334:08 - we go and I'm just going to go ahead and
334:10 - also get rid of this one and then we'll
334:13 - just be really focused on what we need
334:15 - to do at hand
334:17 - here just give me a
334:28 - moment
334:32 - there we go okay so now let's just go
334:35 - back to our GitHub examples and there
334:37 - are a few ways that we can create issues
334:40 - uh one is or sorry branches one way is
334:42 - to go to the branches Tab and I'm pretty
334:44 - sure we can just create them right here
334:46 - so I can go here and just say uh feature
334:50 - uh cool one okay and we can say what
334:53 - we're branching
334:55 - from so that's an example and there it
334:58 - is uh another really useful way and
335:00 - something I really recommend is you
335:02 - create an issue and we'll and we'll make
335:05 - a task saying create a branch from an
335:09 - issue okay and then what we can do is
335:12 - then go ahead and create a branch here
335:15 - in development in the bottom right
335:16 - corner noce is going to put the number
335:18 - in here that's a very common pattern is
335:21 - to have whatever your issued number is
335:24 - and then a a a short name for the branch
335:28 - okay then saying like what should we do
335:30 - next code spaces locally I don't really
335:32 - want to do anything next I just want to
335:35 - um do nothing but I'll go ahead and hit
335:37 - create branch and so then it gives us
335:39 - like a button where we could click to go
335:41 - ahead and play around with it so that is
335:43 - something I do a lot when I teach boot
335:46 - camps I show this a lot this is a very
335:49 - common workflow and something you should
335:50 - absolutely remember uh that you can do
335:53 - um let's go ahead and launch up this in
335:58 - code spaces going to go here and uh we
336:01 - have this one here sure I'll launch up
336:05 - this old one sure why not and once this
336:08 - is launched up we'll take a look and
336:10 - learn how to use a very cool shorthand
336:13 - for um
336:15 - implementing uh checkout
336:18 - and creating a branch in one go okay so
336:21 - just back here when this is ready all
336:23 - right all right so this is back up and
336:25 - running and notice that we are currently
336:26 - in the main branch we can type in get
336:28 - Branch to get a list of br branches and
336:31 - so what I want to do is I want to create
336:32 - myself a new Branch here and actually
336:34 - there are other branches it's just not
336:36 - showing them if we do get
336:38 - pull um it might show us those other
336:40 - branches there we go and now if we type
336:42 - in get
336:43 - Branch it still doesn't show them but
336:45 - that doesn't mean we can't check them
336:46 - out but uh our um our uh uh program is
336:51 - aware of it we might also be able to
336:53 - create branches within a git graph these
336:55 - were things that we installed earlier so
336:57 - they might have the option to do that
337:00 - here I'm not 100%
337:02 - sure see create Branch so we could do
337:04 - that as well I'm not going to do that
337:06 - but what I really want to show you is
337:08 - something that will show up in the exam
337:10 - I'm actually really surprised that it
337:11 - did but it is a really good thing to to
337:14 - um uh to know is that normally when you
337:16 - create a branch you'd have to type in
337:18 - get branch and I'd say my new Branch
337:21 - like this and then I'd have to do get
337:24 - check out my new
337:26 - Branch okay and so that's something you
337:29 - can do
337:30 - but what is more efficient you go check
337:33 - out back to main is we can do that in
337:35 - one call we can see get checkout hyphen
337:38 - B for branch my new Branch 2 and that's
337:42 - going to create that branch and check it
337:44 - out so really make sure you remember
337:46 - this one because it will absolutely show
337:47 - up on your exam it's absolutely
337:48 - something you'll use every single day I
337:50 - strongly recommend it the last thing um
337:52 - I want to go over is just pushing to
337:54 - origin so what we can do is is set um
337:58 - Upstream but think that U is a lot
338:01 - easier to do we say origin and we just
338:03 - say my new Branch here two and then that
338:08 - will push that Branch up there because
338:10 - you really want to know how to set that
338:11 - origin so that's all I really wanted to
338:13 - show you and um yeah we can just stop
338:15 - this environment so we'll go ahead to
338:17 - command pallet just say stop current
338:20 - code space and I'll see you in the next
338:22 - one okay
338:24 - [Music]
338:28 - CIA so starring repos is uh something
338:31 - that we can do and it's similar to
338:34 - bookmarking uh for a repo that we're
338:36 - interested in keeping track of and so
338:38 - stars are public and everyone can see
338:40 - them and usually this is an indicator
338:43 - whether something is really popular in
338:45 - fact GitHub might take notice uh in
338:47 - their community and do something nice um
338:49 - so a lot of people seem to care about
338:50 - star counts and uh make it their goal to
338:53 - try to get as many as they can if you
338:55 - want to find um starred projects that
338:57 - you have starred you can go to
338:58 - github.com
338:59 - stars and there's a few other things
339:01 - that we can explore um and you know in
339:04 - the exam they might actually ask you
339:06 - what that URL is to get to uh your
339:09 - starred um uh uh starred things that you
339:12 - have starred so just make sure you
339:13 - remember that URL
339:15 - [Music]
339:18 - okay hey this is Angie Brown and this
339:21 - follow along I want to take a look at
339:22 - starring Repose so what we can do here
339:25 - is just go into our own project and I
339:28 - think we could star our own which is a
339:30 - little bit silly but it's something we
339:31 - can do we could also put it into a list
339:33 - so let's go ahead and hit start and I
339:35 - might also want to say this is for
339:37 - inspiration and so now that I've started
339:39 - that stuff let's go take a look at our
339:41 - actual start pages so we could type in
339:42 - Stars at the top here but I think also
339:44 - on the right hand side we can go to your
339:47 - stars and um I mean this is
339:50 - showing stuff that we've starred and
339:53 - this has a list but that wasn't the same
339:55 - page that I saw so I'm actually
339:56 - surprised this is different and maybe
339:58 - there's actually two there's this one
340:00 - and another one so let's go ahead and
340:01 - type in Stars at the top
340:03 - here yeah why do they have why do they
340:06 - have two different pages they got this
340:09 - one and then they got this one and to me
340:12 - it's like the same
340:14 - thing okay whatever I guess maybe one is
340:17 - specific to the repo so this one's for
340:19 - Andre Brown Stars so is that like public
340:21 - ones that everyone else can see what if
340:23 - I go up to here to my profile you know
340:26 - what I actually never noticed these tabs
340:28 - up here before so yeah I guess this is
340:30 - your public profile one of things that
340:33 - you have started if you want to show
340:34 - other people I didn't realize that and
340:37 - then we actually have this other one
340:38 - which is the Stars
340:41 - okay um I could probably show you
340:43 - something a little bit more because in
340:45 - mine I have a lot more starred stuff not
340:47 - that I remember what I have starred but
340:49 - if we go here to Stars you can see a lot
340:52 - more uh stuff here and it shows you
340:54 - could jump to a friend we have
340:56 - categories which is kind of cool I don't
340:58 - really see the list
340:59 - here but I suppose that's more for the
341:02 - profile uh but yeah that's about it um
341:06 - and maybe you might want to remember uh
341:09 - over here you all for this okay because
341:13 - like I remember just on the exam they're
341:14 - asking about like the star the star URL
341:17 - and I know that's supposed to be Stars
341:19 - okay but we'll see you in the next one
341:22 - [Music]
341:25 - ciao another thing we can do is watch
341:27 - repos and this allows you to stay stay
341:29 - informed about activities occurring
341:30 - within a repo so the idea is that you'll
341:32 - hit watch and then you can say uh to
341:34 - what level of notifications you want for
341:36 - watching and notice that if I go custom
341:38 - I can say exactly what I'm looking to
341:40 - watch and in then your GitHub account
341:42 - you can specify how you want to be
341:44 - notified so there you
341:46 - [Music]
341:49 - go let's take a look at watching repos
341:52 - and I actually can point out a repo that
341:53 - drives me crazy because um somehow I got
341:56 - I got subscribed to it and they update
341:58 - it so often and it's Wing Lang and I'm
342:00 - not saying it's a bad project I'm just
342:02 - saying like they really shouldn't have
342:03 - opted everybody into the uh to the
342:06 - alerts because it it's driven me
342:08 - crazy um so like notice here I said stop
342:11 - ignoring because I I was like tired of
342:13 - getting updates for this and the reason
342:15 - why was that in order to get access to
342:17 - this project in the beta they had to add
342:19 - you uh in some in some manner I'm not
342:22 - sure if it was a contributor or
342:23 - something else but all I know I was
342:26 - really getting sick and tired of getting
342:27 - alerts on my phone so cuz it'll it'll
342:29 - have in summaries and it'll it'll fill
342:30 - up these digest emails and it gets
342:33 - annoying so I ignored it okay but let's
342:35 - go ahead and I'm going to pretend that I
342:37 - want to uh watch another project here
342:40 - from Andrew Brown and we can go over
342:43 - here to GitHub examples and then we can
342:45 - go ahead and click watch and um we can
342:48 - say all activity right we go to custom
342:51 - change maybe we just want
342:52 - issues okay I'll go back and say for
342:55 - everything here there we go and I just
342:58 - want to point out if you go to your
343:00 - settings uh your settings over here and
343:03 - then we go to Notifications we can
343:06 - control you know what we want to see for
343:08 - notification specifically for watching
343:10 - we can say here on GitHub or email you
343:14 - say I don't want the emails okay so very
343:17 - straightforward um is there a place to
343:19 - see all of the stuff that you're
343:20 - watching
343:23 - probably uh we could try
343:25 - like I think it's under notifications
343:27 - it's like notifications maybe it's like
343:29 - watching I know this is another slide
343:31 - later on in the course here it is and so
343:33 - I can see everything that I'm watching
343:36 - and I could just say stop watching all
343:38 - the stuff notice that I'm automatically
343:40 - watching stuff for my own repo so
343:42 - automatically you're always set to watch
343:44 - all of them if that makes sense but
343:46 - there you
343:47 - [Music]
343:50 - go feature previews allows you to enable
343:54 - or disable features that are in beta in
343:56 - your personal accounts so the idea is
343:57 - that we have feature uh feat previews
343:59 - and we go over here and then just kind
344:01 - of enable it is what we want to have um
344:04 - some of them might be already turned on
344:05 - some of them you might want to turn off
344:07 - but let's go take a look at it
344:13 - okay all right so I'm in my count and I
344:15 - want to go ahead and take a look at fe
344:17 - uh feature previews I don't want to
344:18 - meddle with my main account but I'm
344:20 - going to go here and go to feature
344:21 - previews and here we can see some stuff
344:23 - so let's say we wanted the command
344:25 - pallet that sounds really cool I'm going
344:27 - to turn that on actually I think it's
344:29 - already on I didn't even know that we
344:30 - could do that and it seems like we would
344:32 - have like this Global search thing we
344:34 - could turn off slash commands if we
344:35 - wanted to so we say disable or enable it
344:38 - let's go take a look at command pallets
344:39 - because I even know that we had it says
344:41 - here contrl K I'm on a Windows machine
344:44 - right now so we have control all K or
344:45 - control K I'm going to give that a go
344:47 - and so I'm going to try this contrl
344:49 - K oo look at that that is smooth and so
344:53 - then we can jump to something uh what if
344:55 - I type in
344:56 - gists no but I mean like maybe we could
344:59 - find stuff really quickly I mean that's
345:01 - kind of nice like P personal access
345:04 - token uh let's say I want to go to
345:05 - Andrew or let's say we want to go to uh
345:09 - examples oh yeah I'm going to use that a
345:11 - lot more you might see me doing that I
345:13 - might tell you that um I really hope
345:15 - that that becomes a main feature because
345:16 - it's really nice um feature previews I
345:20 - assume this is beta um I don't think
345:23 - Alpha features ever get shown but that
345:25 - is really cool I'm surprised they didn't
345:26 - put that in the exam anyway we'll see
345:28 - the next one okay
345:30 - [Music]
345:34 - ciao so tagging is used to capture a
345:37 - point in history to Mark version
345:39 - released of your codebase and GitHub
345:41 - makes it easy to explore tag versions of
345:44 - your git Rebo so here's an example of
345:46 - Ruby on Rails and you can see they have
345:48 - 516 tags and if you go into the drop
345:51 - down where your branches are you can
345:53 - switch over to the tags and you can see
345:55 - the versioning um tagging is not
345:57 - specific to GitHub it is a feature of G
346:00 - um and just a good practice to know
346:02 - these are common uh git commands get tag
346:05 - commands you absolutely should know
346:06 - they're super useful uh to utilize and a
346:09 - very common um workflow is if you have a
346:12 - production Branch to tag when you tag a
346:14 - release that would be the thing that
346:16 - would trigger it out and send it uh to
346:19 - uh your production compute so um yeah
346:21 - tagging is super important um and often
346:25 - when you see milestones in GitHub
346:26 - they'll usually correspond to tags and
346:28 - we looked at milestones we saw that they
346:29 - were verging them based on or the names
346:31 - of them were based on tag releases that
346:33 - they're they're working towards um so
346:35 - yeah I just want to get you some
346:36 - practical knowledge with tags even if it
346:38 - doesn't show up on the exam
346:40 - [Music]
346:44 - okay hey this is Andrew Brown and this
346:46 - fall along I want to show you tagging
346:48 - and if you're hearing my uh heater in
346:50 - the background it is super cold in my
346:52 - office it's like -10 cels I do not have
346:55 - heat and I'm doing the best I can so
346:57 - sorry for the background noise or the
346:59 - shuffling of the snowsuit but let's go
347:01 - ahead and learn a bit about tagging
347:02 - because tagging is such a useful skill
347:06 - um that there's no way I was not going
347:07 - to show you this so what we'll do is
347:09 - we'll go over to um let's say our GitHub
347:13 - our GitHub examples repo going to go
347:15 - over here
347:17 - and um yeah we'll go into this one here
347:20 - and what I want to do here is I want to
347:22 - start making some tags and what we'll
347:24 - need to do is launch up a new code
347:27 - space okay we'll give it a moment to
347:29 - load up and I'll be back in just a
347:30 - minute you know what I think what I
347:32 - ended up doing was running the exam Pro
347:34 - GitHub example so I'm just going to go
347:36 - back because this one's never going to
347:37 - work for me and I'm going to make sure
347:40 - that I'm in the correct directory so
347:42 - it's this one that I want and we'll go
347:44 - back up here I'm going to go ahead and
347:47 - uh well if I already have an active one
347:48 - I would probably rather use that so I'm
347:51 - just going to open this one you just got
347:52 - to get your code space up however you're
347:54 - going to get it up um but I just want to
347:56 - get in here and get working so I'm going
347:57 - to launch this one
347:59 - no that was the one that was building I
348:01 - think yeah I'm not sure sure exactly
348:04 - what's wrong container build failed
348:06 - checking troubleshooting view
348:08 - logs uh I didn't know you check the logs
348:10 - as it's
348:14 - building Docker build X build
348:22 - failed it's it's uh failing with
348:25 - terraform so um I thought we uh I
348:29 - thought we fixed that so if we go into
348:31 - this is this still having the terraform
348:33 - code in here it is so what I'm just
348:35 - going to do here just to
348:37 - um you know what I think it is um
348:40 - because sometimes it works and sometimes
348:41 - it doesn't and what happened last time
348:43 - is it ran out of
348:45 - space uh is what I noticed it was really
348:47 - a weird thing that happened so what I'm
348:48 - going to do is just stop this code
348:50 - workspace go up
348:54 - here stop stop stop let me stop it
348:58 - please
348:59 - you ran out of space that's fine I get
349:01 - it let me stop the
349:03 - workspace okay and what I'm going to do
349:06 - since this seems to get us more reliable
349:08 - results is always deleting the code
349:12 - space I'm going to go ahead and delete
349:14 - this here and I'm just going to go ahead
349:16 - and make a new one okay so go all the
349:19 - way back here
349:21 - to the Andre Brown one here and we'll
349:24 - make a new one and unfortunately that's
349:26 - the most reliable way to use codes space
349:29 - again I really prefer giod I don't have
349:31 - these issues with giod ever but we'll
349:33 - let this spin up and I'll be back here
349:34 - in just a moment okay and this
349:36 - environment is still failing to build
349:38 - it's really bizarre what's going on here
349:41 - um and I'm not exactly sure why it's
349:43 - failing but
349:47 - uh okay what I'm going to do I'm going
349:48 - to go back to view logs here because
349:50 - maybe it's messing up on that terraform
349:54 - again it is Terron it's like download a
349:57 - bunch of stuff I don't need so what I'm
349:59 - going to do is I'm going to go in here
350:02 - and I'm just going to ignore this I'm
350:03 - sure it's going to continue spinning up
350:05 - I'm going to click into my Dev container
350:07 - and I'm going to edit this and for
350:09 - whatever reason it's just not working so
350:11 - I'm going to comment this out for
350:13 - now and we're going to just pretend
350:15 - terraform doesn't
350:17 - exist was working fine so many times but
350:22 - if that fixes it that's good enough for
350:23 - me okay so I'm going to go to our uh
350:26 - code spaces again go ahead and delete
350:29 - this
350:31 - one and I'm going to go back to that
350:34 - repo if I can please make sure I'm on
350:37 - the right one and we'll go ahead and
350:38 - launch it and then maybe that must be
350:41 - old Let me refresh that I thought we
350:42 - stopped it there we go we'll start a new
350:45 - one and then maybe this time we'll get
350:47 - into code spaces so see you back in a
350:49 - second okay all right so this
350:51 - environment finally worked I guess
350:53 - terraform was giving us trouble and you
350:55 - know I thought these these these
350:56 - packages were pre-built
350:59 - um but I guess there must be compiling
351:01 - at the time of source code and there's
351:02 - some issue that's happening so it might
351:04 - not have that we ran out of space it
351:05 - just might have not worked and totally a
351:07 - detour to what we wanted to be doing but
351:09 - what I'm going to do is go ahead and
351:10 - create a new folder here and this one's
351:12 - going to be called Tags as we want to
351:14 - just work through some tagging
351:17 - stuff readme.md
351:21 - okay and uh there's a few things I want
351:23 - to show you how to do the first thing is
351:25 - how to tag so like we could say version
351:27 - 1.0.0 we could push our
351:30 - tags we will check out we could check
351:33 - out a tag at some
351:35 - point I mean that's pretty
351:37 - straightforward I don't think I need to
351:38 - show you that but I'm just going to
351:39 - write it out here so you can see it
351:41 - 1.0.0 we can do get tag hyphen d one Z Z
351:44 - to delete our tag and then we can uh
351:47 - delete
351:48 - our remote tag those are the three
351:52 - things I want you to know so before we
351:55 - do this I want to talk about
351:57 - semantic
351:59 - versioning because semantic versioning
352:01 - is a
352:03 - way
352:05 - of tagging okay and most repos use this
352:09 - if you see a v in front of it I know I
352:10 - used v as an example there uh in in the
352:13 - actual slides I I put a v in front of it
352:16 - but uh generally this is the format that
352:18 - a lot of Open Source projects and places
352:20 - like to use um depending on how old the
352:23 - project is they might have just stuck
352:25 - with the v in front of it and use
352:27 - everything else with that we can take a
352:28 - look here and see what rails does as an
352:30 - example
352:33 - repo
352:38 - rails and what I want to do here is just
352:41 - take a look at how they're tagging so
352:44 - see they have a v in front of it and but
352:46 - they've been around
352:47 - forever and um I'm just telling you like
352:50 - at one point this page did not exist
352:52 - there there was this idea of semantic
352:54 - versioning but whenever it came out you
352:56 - know some of these projects existed
352:57 - before then so that's the reason why you
352:59 - might not see it um but anyway we'll
353:02 - come back all the way over here and I
353:03 - like to stick with semantic versioning
353:04 - as best I can as long as I remember how
353:06 - to do it and so the idea is uh we want
353:08 - to apply tag to a particular commit and
353:11 - just to make things a little bit easier
353:13 - let's get into a dark theme and the
353:16 - other thing I I'm going to want to have
353:17 - installed here is get
353:19 - graph all
353:23 - right and I think that if we have this
353:26 - installed oh looks like it's already
353:28 - installed did it actually remember my
353:30 - settings remember I complain about how
353:32 - often it does not remember my settings
353:33 - it might actually worked in this case so
353:35 - if I go down below here I have git graph
353:37 - and grit log they're actually both
353:38 - installed but why the theme didn't
353:40 - persist I don't know and the idea here
353:42 - is that I want to be able to apply a tag
353:45 - um and the way we can do that is we're
353:49 - going to go ahead we have some
353:50 - uncommitted changes going just say
353:52 - tagging whoops we'll just say uh
353:56 - tagging here and we'll go ahead and
353:58 - first try to apply a tag so we'll say
354:01 - get tag
354:03 - 1.0.0 and it should show up here there
354:05 - it is okay great but understand this tag
354:07 - is local if we go over to our
354:09 - repo and we give this a nice
354:13 - refresh it's not here zero tags okay so
354:17 - if we want that tag to go up have to go
354:19 - get push hyphen hyen tags okay when you
354:23 - do your regular push you can add that as
354:25 - well you can see that it's been pushed
354:26 - we'll go back over to here here we'll
354:28 - give this a nice refresh and now we have
354:31 - one tag we go over here one tag so good
354:36 - shape right um and the idea is you can
354:38 - switch over to it just like a branch you
354:39 - can check it out just like a branch um
354:41 - and so that's something that is really
354:43 - useful if we go back over to get G graph
354:47 - we can now see uh it actually doesn't
354:49 - show you if it's pushed which is U one
354:51 - thing I think is a bit sad but uh it
354:54 - doesn't show you when it's pushed so
354:56 - that is one indicator that can be a
354:57 - little bit confusing here um and
355:00 - actually when we did push push tags it
355:02 - didn't actually push the uh the commit
355:04 - so I always thought it did both but I
355:05 - guess it only does the tag when you do
355:06 - that so we'll type in get push and make
355:09 - sure that that's pushed as well there we
355:10 - go they're all over here now let's say
355:13 - we made a mistake with their tag
355:15 - sometimes you do this you might uh
355:16 - someone else tag something and then you
355:18 - tagged it the same and you got to delete
355:20 - your tag so we have to delete it in two
355:22 - places we have to delete it locally get
355:24 - tag hyen
355:26 - d10 okay okay but if you go here it
355:30 - still exists so I'm going to give this a
355:32 - nice hard
355:33 - refresh and this absolutely exists so if
355:37 - we want to get rid of this one we're
355:38 - going to have to type get tag hyphen
355:42 - hyphen delete origin one0
355:45 - Z okay um and it didn't work
355:53 - there I mean that's the oh you know it's
355:56 - push it's push sorry it's push we'll say
355:58 - get push delete origin 1.0.0 point0 and
356:02 - so now it's deleted it we probably
356:04 - should have took a look at the um uh the
356:07 - GitHub config file that there might have
356:08 - been something interesting there but uh
356:10 - we didn't I'm going go ahead and give
356:11 - this a nice refresh
356:14 - here and I'm just curious what would
356:16 - this is rails it's not us but if we go
356:18 - back here and give this a refresh this
356:20 - should now be
356:21 - gone I'm just going to tag this one more
356:23 - time okay so I'm going to go ahead here
356:25 - and say get tag 1.0
356:28 - .0 I'm going to say get push hyphen hyen
356:32 - tags if you wanted to tag some other
356:34 - place you have to check out that commit
356:36 - using the shot code and then tag it I'm
356:37 - not going to do that here let's go take
356:39 - a look at the um the git directory
356:44 - because in that git directory it might
356:45 - show us
356:47 - something interesting in the config file
356:49 - so we go to
356:50 - settings and we know that we have
356:53 - to tell to unhide certain
356:56 - stuff
356:59 - okay so I'm looking
357:02 - for hidden files in here it's somewhere
357:04 - in
357:06 - here put type in dogit could find
357:09 - that
357:13 - dogit here it is it's under exclusions
357:17 - so I want to just take that out so I can
357:19 - see it and we'll go ahead and open up
357:21 - our config directory because what I want
357:24 - to see is if there was any tagging
357:25 - information in here and there's not so
357:27 - so there's nothing new here to see I
357:29 - just thought there might be but yeah
357:31 - that's all there is to tagging and uh
357:33 - we'll call this one done and I'll see
357:34 - you in the next one um okay so
357:39 - [Music]
357:42 - ciao so GitHub releases allows you to
357:45 - create releases with release notes and
357:47 - linked assets such as zip sources or
357:49 - binaries for specific platforms so in a
357:52 - get repo you'll see releases and from
357:54 - there you can read about the release and
357:56 - see all the stuff that has changed
357:58 - and there might be the source code or
358:00 - binaries if you if this is something
358:02 - like um I'm trying to think of an
358:04 - example like let's say you like to play
358:05 - video games and there's an emulator uh
358:07 - for like the PlayStation uh they'll have
358:09 - like builds here for Windows Mac and um
358:12 - other things here uh maybe you make a
358:14 - video game in general you could
358:17 - distribute the binary here it's anything
358:19 - where you're Distributing the binaries
358:20 - or the SCE source code but you're making
358:22 - very clear what has changed as a release
358:25 - um and often like when I'm having issu
358:27 - issues with something I will actually go
358:29 - through and read the releases when let's
358:31 - say um like react router have you ever
358:34 - used react router Dom and they've
358:36 - changed versions I'm trying to
358:37 - understand like what compatibilities
358:38 - have changed what does not work anymore
358:40 - maybe I was experiencing a bug and if
358:42 - they do a good job with the
358:43 - documentation it will be in there so
358:45 - there you
358:46 - [Music]
358:49 - go hey everyone in this fall along I
358:52 - want to take a look at GitHub releases
358:54 - as it is a very useful feature to let
358:56 - people know about changes that are
358:57 - happening in your repo um so before we
359:00 - do let's go take a look at some other
359:03 - project that might have changes I'm
359:04 - trying to think of something interesting
359:06 - like maybe an
359:07 - emulator um so I'm just typing emulator
359:10 - in here I'm just looking for one here's
359:12 - a Nintendo switch emulator or maybe PS
359:14 - PS2 I'd rather do PS2 I feel like they
359:16 - might have good uh information about
359:18 - changes like PCS pcsx2 and on the right
359:22 - hand side you can see we have releases
359:24 - and if we open up the
359:26 - releases um they do not tell you much
359:29 - okay so that's not a great example so
359:32 - we'll go back to another one and we'll
359:33 - try another uh video game emulator maybe
359:37 - we can just try putting the word
359:40 - emulator you know and people can write
359:43 - whatever kind of releases they want this
359:44 - doesn't have
359:46 - releases uh we'll try the 3DS emulator
359:49 - this one doesn't have
359:52 - releases we
359:54 - have
359:56 - um this one here do they have
359:59 - releases no well they do they do no just
360:03 - tags okay so I guess we're just going to
360:06 - not get really good ones here but I
360:08 - guess we could just go to rails because
360:09 - they seem to always have enough for us
360:11 - but I just wanted something that was
360:12 - written a little bit more uh nicer so
360:14 - you could see a good example of a
360:16 - release but here is one where um you
360:18 - know they're talking about different
360:19 - versions I feel like if there was a
360:21 - release for a specific uh tag
360:25 - version right that uh we get better
360:28 - information like when rails first came
360:30 - out like 70 probably would be a good one
360:32 - so I'm just scrolling through here I
360:34 - mean these are pretty good but again I
360:35 - just want to try to find a major release
360:36 - one is this this
360:40 - 1.0 seven I'm going to just type in
360:45 - 7.0.0 might have to scroll a bit to get
360:47 - it to load
360:51 - 08 there must
360:53 - be where is it what it just skips over
360:57 - it
360:57 - okay well I mean 71 was pretty good so
361:00 - we'll go over back to
361:03 - 71 and uh yeah like here it's telling
361:06 - you about all the libraries and things
361:08 - that are Chang this one's a bit better
361:10 - because it's showing examples of things
361:11 - that have changed so you can p whatever
361:13 - you want to release and it's just to
361:14 - help communicate what the differences
361:16 - are because a lot of times you just
361:17 - don't know so we did do some tagging and
361:20 - that's a great opportunity for us to
361:21 - create our own release in our own repo
361:24 - so what I'm going to do is go back over
361:25 - to our home I'm going to find find this
361:27 - repo that we have I'm going to go over
361:29 - to releases and we're going to create
361:31 - ourselves our own release and we'll just
361:33 - say version uh 1.0.0 ready for the
361:40 - world the best GitHub example materials
361:46 - around my hands are cold if if you can't
361:49 - tell I'm
361:51 - uh sorry but I'm in like full snowsuit
361:54 - right now and I got the heater blowing
361:56 - so if you hear the heater I apologize
361:58 - but it's just how it is right now in my
361:59 - office anyway we you can choose a tag
362:03 - which is great and then um you can then
362:07 - attach the binary so the idea is we
362:10 - would download the zip and then
362:11 - re-upload it again I'm not going to do
362:13 - that because that's pretty
362:13 - straightforward we'll go ahead and do
362:15 - that and so there's our release and
362:16 - that's all I really wanted to show you
362:18 - for releases apparently there's a
362:19 - compare button I didn't even know that
362:21 - so that might be kind of cool to do but
362:23 - um yeah there you
362:26 - go
362:28 - [Music]
362:29 - so GitHub packages is a platform for
362:31 - hosting and managing packages including
362:33 - containers and other dependencies and
362:35 - the things that it can uh host in terms
362:37 - of its package registry or repository is
362:40 - Javascript packages ruby gems Java Maven
362:43 - and Gradle packages net packages and
362:46 - Docker images and the last one I think
362:48 - is going to be the most common uh one
362:50 - that people can utilize um they have a
362:52 - free tier they have a pay tier so you
362:54 - can start using this right away and we
362:55 - will go give it a go
362:57 - um probably the easiest thing we could
362:59 - do would be to create a Docker uh
363:01 - container and then push it to GitHub
363:03 - packages so that's kind of the code that
363:05 - we'll have to go through we can make a
363:06 - simple hello world Docker file run it
363:09 - make sure we build it and uh GitHub
363:11 - actions could be used to build and then
363:14 - publish I put I wrote the word public
363:16 - but publish packages to GitHub pages so
363:19 - there you
363:20 - [Music]
363:23 - go hey this is Angie Brown and this fall
363:26 - along what I want to do is is go ahead
363:27 - and create a GitHub package so what
363:29 - you're going to need to do is start up a
363:31 - code space I actually already have mine
363:32 - running I think by this point you
363:34 - probably know how to do that I just uh
363:36 - was working on the video earlier and I
363:37 - had to close out and restart so that's
363:39 - where we are now so anyway I'm going to
363:42 - make a new folder in here this will be
363:44 - for uh pack GitHub GitHub packages
363:48 - okay and you're going to try to spell s
363:51 - if you hear a bit of noise in the
363:52 - background it's cuz I'm running the
363:54 - little space heater near my feet so my
363:55 - feet don't freeze I'm in full snowsuit
363:58 - right now okay but anyway what we'll do
364:01 - is we'll go
364:02 - into the package of directory and we'll
364:05 - make a new file and we'll call it Docker
364:08 - file okay and from here um we want to
364:14 - create this little Docker image so we'll
364:17 - say
364:19 - Alpine uh latest this isn't a Docker
364:22 - course I'm not teaching all this but
364:23 - just follow along with me here or just
364:26 - copy paste it from my repo whichever you
364:27 - want to do
364:29 - Echo we'll say hello world okay so I'm
364:33 - going to go ahead and save that file and
364:36 - now what I want to do is go into that
364:38 - directory and build
364:42 - it so what I'll do is run Docker build
364:46 - hyphen T hello world
364:50 - period we'll build
364:54 - that okay and and now we'll try to run
364:58 - it make sure it
365:03 - works there we go that works
365:07 - okay and so we're in good
365:10 - shape uh the other part here I would say
365:13 - is now that we have our Docker image
365:15 - built we want to now push that so um I'm
365:18 - going to make a new read me file so I
365:19 - just have a little bit of room to work
365:20 - with
365:22 - here and there's a few things we need to
365:24 - do we need to set our username so I'm
365:26 - going to say
365:27 - username here I'm just going to set mine
365:29 - as what I am Andrew Brown WC Brown
365:32 - that's the count that I have
365:34 - here okay and I'm going to put export in
365:37 - front of
365:38 - it so I can export
365:41 - it and yeah I want allow pasting good
365:44 - and we'll hit enter it actually double
365:46 - pasted it so I got to be careful there I
365:48 - imagine this is a bit hard to read so
365:50 - I'm just going to bump up the font a
365:52 - bit and so that should be set the next
365:56 - thing is I'll need a personal access
365:57 - token so I'm going to go over here and
366:00 - we've done personal access tokens quite
366:01 - a bit in this course and we'll go down
366:04 - to developer settings and we'll make a
366:06 - new one and this one is going to well I
366:08 - guess we got to confirm with GitHub
366:09 - mobile
366:11 - first get my phone out
366:14 - here and uh it wants me to enter a code
366:21 - in one
366:24 - two okay this one's going to be for
366:29 - GitHub
366:32 - packages oh I'm not registering an app
366:35 - whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa let's go back
366:37 - personal access tokens there we go
366:39 - there's an old one I'm going to delete
366:40 - that and I'm going to generate out a new
366:41 - one we'll
366:43 - say uh GitHub
366:46 - packages I want this only to be for a
366:49 - day just in case I forget it and someone
366:50 - tries to take
366:52 - it and this is going to be
366:55 - for a specific
366:58 - repo so we'll go down
367:01 - here and say this
367:05 - repo and then for permissions I'm
367:08 - looking for
367:10 - packages packages it's under here
367:14 - maybe packages let's search for it
367:18 - packages it says we need a personal
367:20 - access
367:25 - token um
367:28 - so I'm not seeing packages in here and
367:31 - this makes me think that we should
367:32 - probably use a traditional one I don't
367:33 - normally do this but because I cannot
367:35 - find it I'm going use a classic
367:39 - token so that's what I'm going to do um
367:43 - I'm going to go here I'm going to
367:44 - generate a new token really wants to
367:47 - make make a new one and just say GitHub
367:50 - packages and so it's really similar um
367:53 - very similar to the other
367:55 - one well I wanted expire and I'm looking
367:59 - for
368:00 - packages here it is read and write
368:04 - packages delete packages so I'm not sure
368:06 - where that new one is in the new one
368:08 - maybe it's not and we just have to use
368:10 - the classic token we'll go ahead and
368:12 - generate that token out I now have this
368:14 - token I'm going to bring it on over to
368:16 - uh uh here and I want to set this as our
368:20 - environment variables I'm going to say
368:21 - GH token and we're going to paste that
368:25 - in okay we'll we'll copy this good I'll
368:29 - paste it in and hit enter so now that's
368:32 - set um I need to set the image
368:34 - name I'm just going to keep putting the
368:36 - GH under it image name just so it's a
368:38 - bit easier for me to find them when I
368:39 - want to find all the environment
368:41 - variables later hello world we'll go
368:44 - ahead and do
368:45 - that and copy that and paste it in hit
368:49 - enter uh I'm going to put export in
368:51 - front of that just in case that didn't
368:53 - work and then I'm going to do export
368:57 - my hands are really
368:59 - cold it's really cold in here uh I think
369:03 - it's
369:06 - like7 it's because my shed uh has a um
369:10 - oil furnace or gas yeah oil furnace and
369:12 - I have to go drive out to um The the
369:15 - Reserve to get some gas and it's just
369:18 - really bad weather so I'm just trying to
369:20 - get this done so you folks can get this
369:22 - course as quickly as possible so we've
369:24 - exported those values so that's really
369:26 - good I want to make sure that they're
369:27 - set so I'm going to type in EnV GP GH
369:32 - and there they are okay so now we need
369:34 - to write some code the first thing is we
369:36 - need to log into Docker and so Docker
369:38 - somehow talks to GitHub I'm not sure how
369:41 - that works but we'll just go ahead and
369:43 - work with it here so I'm going to say
369:44 - Docker login U we're going to say g c
369:48 - say GHC so that's for GitHub container
369:51 - repository I'm assuming hyphen U and
369:53 - then we'll say GH username and then
369:56 - we'll say password STD in okay so
370:00 - that'll pass the password that's what
370:01 - that pipe
370:02 - does and see if that works we'll hit
370:06 - enter uh doesn't know what that flag
370:10 - is did I type it wrong I
370:15 - did and we'll copy that and we'll paste
370:17 - that there enter and so now we're logged
370:19 - in so that's step number one step number
370:21 - two is we need to tag our Docker
370:24 - container so we'll say uh Docker tag and
370:26 - I want my image name and then my
370:30 - version uh this will be GH version and
370:33 - this will
370:34 - be GH I mean we could just write it out
370:38 - if it's a bit simpler for everybody so
370:40 - we just say hello world one0 and then on
370:44 - the other side be
370:45 - GHC doio and then that would be our
370:49 - username so I could just type it in here
370:52 - it's up to you whether you want to use
370:53 - environment variables or not I'm just uh
370:56 - I just want it to work so I'm just going
370:57 - to write it out in full even though we
370:59 - made environment variables up here for
371:00 - this particular use case but that's okay
371:02 - one z z so the idea is we're going to
371:05 - tag um our Docker image we built is uh
371:10 - for 1.0 to map to here okay we'll go
371:13 - ahead and copy that hit
371:15 - enter um no such image I mean there is
371:18 - no tag called 1.0.0 on it we do Docker
371:22 - list or Docker
371:24 - images it's called latest
371:27 - so we'll change this to be
371:29 - latest we can make the other tag latest
371:31 - as well but I I'm going to make it 1.0.0
371:33 - I'm not sure why I'm just going to do
371:34 - that so how it's going to be we'll go
371:36 - ahead and enter and so now that's tagged
371:38 - and so now we should be able to push
371:41 - it GHC doio slash say
371:47 - Andrew WC Brown for slash hello
371:53 - world colon
371:55 - 1.0.0
371:58 - copy
372:01 - enter um so it says an image with the
372:05 - tag does not locally exists with that
372:08 - tag so maybe I tagged it wrong THC R
372:13 - iio I spelled it wrong yeah and we could
372:16 - have just copied this one here to get it
372:19 - all right it enter and there it's
372:21 - pushing it okay so pretty
372:25 - straightforward uh we could have even
372:27 - done this we could said like uh
372:29 - export um tag
372:33 - name right and we could have done
372:38 - this right and then we could just done
372:41 - that and we could have done that I'm
372:43 - just cleaning it up doing that uh post
372:46 - post refactor here and um here we could
372:50 - have just put these in as such so we
372:52 - could have done
372:55 - this
372:57 - and then this would have been
373:01 - GH uh image name and then this would
373:04 - have
373:05 - been GH
373:07 - version and so you get the idea there so
373:10 - that's pretty much it let's go take a
373:11 - look and see where this actually is I'm
373:13 - done with this personal access token so
373:14 - I want to delete it so nobody else is
373:17 - using it
373:19 - and um this revokes all personal access
373:21 - to in class classic just in case I'm
373:23 - going to do this so I'm going to say
373:24 - Andrew WC Brown I think they're all
373:26 - revoked but just in case they not let's
373:28 - do that anyway and we'll go over here
373:31 - and we'll take a look at our profile
373:33 - because it might show up under packages
373:34 - here I'm not exactly sure how you set
373:37 - public packages oh there it is it's
373:39 - private all right
373:42 - and I'm not sure if it's specific to a
373:44 - repo link this package to a repository
373:47 - so I guess if we wanted to link it we
373:48 - would have had to
373:50 - apply a label and so I guess labels are
373:53 - what you think they are they're labels
373:54 - and that way we could associate it I'm
373:55 - not going to that here today I think
373:57 - that's fine but I will copy this just in
374:00 - case anybody else wants to do
374:03 - that and
374:05 - um we'll go ahead and save our
374:11 - changes
374:20 - okay and this really doesn't want to
374:22 - push here today I'm not sure why get
374:25 - push
374:26 - what doesn't it
374:32 - like um oh push protection okay it
374:35 - detects something
374:37 - here oh is my token in here wow that's
374:41 - cool it actually detected it so that
374:42 - because we turned on security scanning
374:44 - earlier it would not let me do
374:47 - that that's awesome I wish we I I
374:50 - thought I was showing that earlier so
374:52 - don't show token actually what we have
374:54 - to do uh is we can even just push the
374:56 - old one we have to amend uh the last one
374:59 - we had so if we go over
375:03 - here uh I'm going to have to go ahead
375:06 - and amend
375:09 - this so I'm trying to figure out if
375:11 - there's a way I can just quickly
375:14 - amend um I'm going to get rid of this
375:16 - change here first I'm just going to say
375:17 - discard this
375:19 - change and I'm going to type in get
375:21 - commit hyphen hyphen
375:24 - amend and so now
375:27 - uh what I should be able to do is go
375:29 - into here for all
375:31 - changes right and I should just change
375:35 - it actually no that'll just amend the
375:37 - message sorry that's not going to do
375:39 - what we
375:40 - want uh what we actually need to do here
375:44 - is we out of amend mode I think we are
375:47 - yeah um I'm going to do get
375:51 - reset uh
375:53 - soft head Tilda one and what that will
375:56 - do is bring the changes back into here
375:58 - and so now I can go back and fix that
375:59 - but that's really good that uh I had the
376:01 - the secret scanner turned
376:03 - on do not commit your GitHub token but
376:05 - we did also delete it so it's less of a
376:07 - problem as
376:10 - well uh GitHub
376:14 - packages so just be really really
376:16 - careful with that stuff
376:19 - okay and there you
376:22 - go so I'll see you the next one okay
376:25 - ciao
376:27 - [Music]
376:31 - so for a GitHub repo under the insights
376:33 - tab you can gain lots of statistical
376:35 - graphs about the repo and so insights
376:38 - contains the following tabs we got pulse
376:41 - this is an overview of recent activity
376:43 - contributors a list contributors and
376:45 - their activity stats Community standards
376:48 - uh commits code frequency dependency
376:51 - graph Network forks and I want to point
376:54 - out that on the exam they definitely I
376:58 - had to know the contents of some of
377:00 - these which I think is really silly but
377:01 - that's how they did the exam and so it's
377:04 - important that you pay close attention
377:05 - here of what kind of stuff can show up
377:07 - on these pages so you can identify uh
377:10 - which uh category of um graphs they're
377:13 - talking about here or charts or whatever
377:15 - you want to call them um and I noticed
377:16 - that repo insights is not listed as
377:18 - available in the free tier but I think
377:21 - if it's a public repo it shows up so
377:23 - maybe they're talking about for private
377:24 - repos I didn't thoroughly test it but I
377:26 - just wanted to point that out about um
377:28 - about that there let's go take a look at
377:31 - all of these in more detail the first is
377:33 - pulse this contains poll requests open
377:35 - close ratio issues open close ratio
377:38 - summary of activity uh graph of top
377:40 - contributors list of merge pull requests
377:43 - list of issues closed list of issues
377:45 - open list of unresolved conversations
377:47 - remember this one because this one will
377:49 - help you narrow down or rule out the
377:51 - rest because this one is a little bit
377:52 - more complex than other ones uh then we
377:55 - have contributors this contains a graph
377:57 - of all commits over a time period a
377:59 - graph of a specific contributor commits
378:01 - over a time period then we have
378:04 - Community standards this is a checklist
378:06 - of uh of recommended I spelled that
378:09 - wrong but recommended Community
378:10 - standards and how much a community
378:13 - profile has completed this graph will
378:15 - only show for repos that have Community
378:17 - profiles so Community profiles are open
378:19 - source projects on GitHub and I think
378:22 - you have to turn it on to turn yours
378:24 - into uh Community profile file okay we
378:27 - have repo insights so this contains a
378:29 - number of commits per week for the last
378:31 - 52 weeks for a year that's how many
378:34 - weeks there are in a year so that kind
378:35 - of makes sense the average number of
378:37 - commits by day uh of the week uh for the
378:40 - selected week then we have um code
378:42 - frequency this contains the amount of
378:45 - additions and deletions of a code uh a
378:47 - code repo or sorry of code to a to a
378:50 - report per month I really wrote that
378:52 - weird but you get the idea that you have
378:54 - additions and deletion over time and I
378:57 - noticed that for really large repos they
379:00 - can't even render it so this is not
379:02 - really useful for large open source
379:03 - projects but um you can see it in
379:05 - smaller projects and that's what I I
379:07 - said right there down at the bottom uh
379:09 - we have dependency graph this contains
379:11 - list of dependencies list of dependence
379:13 - and Export software bills of materials
379:15 - also known as
379:17 - sbmo
379:19 - SB so security and compliance teams
379:22 - increasingly request software bills of
379:24 - materials to identif ify open-source
379:27 - components of their software projects
379:29 - they assess their vulnerability to
379:31 - emerging threats and verify alignment
379:33 - with license policies so sounds like a
379:35 - good thing for security folks um then we
379:38 - have the network graph this thing is
379:42 - super useful um especially when you're
379:44 - working on uh like or you're utilizing
379:47 - an open source project and something
379:48 - goes wrong I will jump into this and try
379:51 - to find uh other commits from other
379:53 - other branches or Forks to to get the
379:56 - functionality that I need in my
379:58 - application so this will show The 100
380:00 - most recent pushed Forks you can read
380:02 - the commits to determine the difference
380:04 - of these Forks um then we have Forks
380:08 - itself so this contains a list of fork
380:10 - filterable Forks very similar to the
380:12 - last one but this is just a a list of
380:14 - forks and the other one is over um over
380:18 - time and it's visualized but yeah I just
380:20 - want to point out that you do need to
380:22 - know these ones uh even though again I
380:24 - think it's a bit silly but but yeah
380:26 - you're going to have to know
380:28 - specifically like what they're doing on
380:30 - these um on these on these Pages or
380:33 - graphs
380:33 - [Music]
380:37 - okay hey it's Andrew Brown and in this
380:39 - fall along we're just going to take a
380:41 - look at repo insights so what I want to
380:43 - do is go to a popular repository like
380:45 - Ruby on Rails that has a lot of activity
380:48 - and take a look at what their insights
380:50 - look like so the first is puls and you
380:53 - really need to know pulse because again
380:55 - on exam they might ask you about this
380:57 - one in particular uh if you notice here
380:59 - we can change the scope so we can say 1
381:01 - month 24 days um this one's going to
381:03 - show us here um open versus closed I
381:07 - believe so we have open and closed pull
381:10 - requests and open and closed issues red
381:13 - being closed I'm going to ass purple is
381:16 - closed and green is open now we have
381:18 - some summaries merged pulled requests
381:20 - open pull requests close Issues new
381:21 - issues these here are all listed down
381:24 - below so if you click click on this it's
381:26 - going to just jump to that location okay
381:28 - so that's how you know what's all down
381:31 - here these four things are listed down
381:34 - below the nice thing here is this
381:35 - summary so excluding merges 75 authors
381:38 - have published 240 247 commits and 388
381:43 - commits etc etc so that's kind of like a
381:45 - thing you can put in a PowerPoint then
381:46 - these are your top contributors so the
381:48 - person that was uh doing all the work
381:50 - here is
381:52 - Jonathan Hefner so good job John uh keep
381:56 - up the great work um let's move on so we
381:59 - have
381:59 - contributors these are people that are
382:01 - contributing code and so it shows kind
382:04 - of a histograph of or ticker ticker tape
382:07 - or whatever you want to call it of the
382:09 - amount of commits that they are
382:10 - committing so we have a good idea there
382:12 - and this is for everybody across the top
382:14 - so in 2014 you can see a lot of stuff
382:16 - was happening probably a major refactor
382:18 - was occurring and that's probably why
382:20 - that's so huge there um probably again
382:23 - other Peaks where you're seeing very
382:24 - large things is is they're preparing for
382:27 - new versions of Ruby on Rails we'll go
382:29 - over to community
382:31 - standards checklist cool we'll go to
382:34 - commits um shows us that there was a lot
382:37 - of activity this year in December so in
382:41 - December I mean this we're in January
382:43 - right now at the time of this video but
382:44 - in December you can see they did a lot
382:46 - of work for Christmas and then back here
382:49 - in February they did a lot of work for
382:50 - some reason you can see Monday seems to
382:52 - be the busy day but I'm not sure oh you
382:55 - clicked find out okay before I didn't
382:57 - know like if this is over time but I
382:59 - guess it's like you click it and then it
383:00 - shows you okay code frequency won't show
383:05 - us here okay dependency graph uh things
383:08 - that it's dependent on makes sense
383:10 - Network this will take a little bit of
383:12 - time because this has at least 100 forks
383:16 - we'll give it a moment but I'm telling
383:18 - you this thing is super powerful and
383:22 - I've used it since the day it's existed
383:24 - and it's been around for very long long
383:25 - time um but when you're working on open
383:28 - source projects and you're having issues
383:31 - you can bet your buttons that somebody
383:32 - else is already fixed it and you can
383:34 - just go look at their commits and figure
383:36 - that stuff out so yeah we'll let that
383:39 - keep loading and while that's loading
383:40 - we'll open a new tab we'll take a look
383:42 - at Forks so here's all our
383:44 - Forks okay we can sort based on stuff uh
383:49 - and hopefully the exam won't ask you
383:50 - about what you can filter by they they
383:52 - do that for issues for some weird reason
383:53 - but uh come back here and so we can see
383:55 - this is rails right and so if we go over
383:58 - here we can see oh this person's doing
384:00 - something make the this relation model
384:03 - delegation strictor they have a work in
384:06 - progress here we go down here add a read
384:09 - me something in another language update
384:12 - screenshot and getting started with
384:15 - rails but sometimes yeah fix style code
384:18 - sometimes people find like bugs and
384:21 - before they even get fixed they'll be in
384:22 - someone else's fork and so you can grab
384:24 - them and just keep working but uh yeah
384:27 - that is um insights we can take a look
384:30 - and see if we get any insights in our
384:32 - teeny tiny repos we'll go to this one
384:36 - here and we get
384:38 - insights and so we already have some
384:40 - stuff here we can see a few different
384:42 - Andrew Browns notice here that shows
384:44 - exam Pro Dev the reason why is that you
384:46 - can have
384:48 - um uh you can like if I'm on my computer
384:52 - my computer which is here uh it can have
384:55 - a different get email and name set so
384:58 - even though it is from this account
385:00 - which it was it can show a different
385:02 - person was contributing so just be aware
385:05 - of that but anyway yeah that is repo
385:08 - insights see you in the next one
385:11 - [Music]
385:15 - ciao so in GitHub we are able to create
385:18 - ourselves issues and it's pretty
385:20 - straightforward you just need a title
385:21 - and description and we can also create
385:23 - it via the GitHub CL Li um there's not
385:27 - really much else to say about creating
385:29 - issues um but there you go
385:32 - [Music]
385:35 - okay all right let's do a comparison
385:38 - between issues discussions and poll
385:40 - requests it's very important to
385:42 - understand or distinguish these three
385:44 - things because they seem kind of similar
385:46 - but uh they're not um so the first is
385:49 - issues they are for tracking tasks bugs
385:51 - enhancements and other actionable items
385:53 - then you have discussions these are
385:54 - facilitating conversations and q&as
385:57 - about a wide range of topics related to
386:00 - uh the project and then you have P
386:02 - request proposing reviewing and merging
386:04 - code changes in the codebase so on the
386:06 - issue side this is often linked to code
386:09 - changes and can be linked to PRS for
386:12 - discussions you have categorized by
386:14 - topics can be converted to an issue but
386:17 - really it just creates an issue with a
386:19 - soft link to the issue so it doesn't
386:21 - really have the same kind of
386:21 - relationship that an issue would have
386:23 - with a PR um it's not directly linked to
386:26 - code changes um so again discussions are
386:28 - really for as it's implied Community uh
386:31 - engagement or uh conversation around
386:34 - your repo um we have for pull requests
386:37 - directly linked to code changes can be
386:39 - linked to issues now I should point out
386:41 - that when you have the numbering for
386:44 - issues it has like one 2 3 four five
386:47 - your poll request will I think pull from
386:49 - the same pool of numbers we'll test that
386:51 - to make sure that's the case um and so
386:54 - uh just understand that when you
386:56 - reference issues or pull requests um
386:58 - they're pulling from the same number
386:59 - pool okay there you
387:02 - [Music]
387:05 - go so what I want to do in this video is
387:08 - I want to prove a theory that the issues
387:10 - and pull requests are pulling from the
387:11 - same number pool in terms of when
387:13 - they're incrementing so what I'm going
387:15 - to do is I'm going to go over uh to our
387:17 - GitHub examples repo um and I want to
387:22 - create a new issue and make note of the
387:24 - number that is is used so we're going to
387:26 - go here and I'm just going to say uh
387:29 - create a
387:31 - new um issue okay and we'll create this
387:37 - and notice that we have the number seven
387:40 - okay so we have the number seven so the
387:42 - question is if we were to use a new poll
387:46 - request create a new poll request what
387:48 - would we get so I'm going to make a new
387:50 - pull request and I technically have some
387:53 - code that I can merge it if you don't
387:55 - then you'll have to make some but I'm
387:57 - going to go ahead and create this new
387:58 - pull request and this will be Andre
388:00 - Brown into the exam Pro repo go all the
388:02 - way down the bottom or maybe all the way
388:04 - to the top sorry and we're going to go
388:05 - ahead and create that new portal request
388:07 - and just say more changes okay and let's
388:11 - make note of the number the number here
388:13 - is five we go over to issues the last
388:16 - one that we created in our
388:19 - um oh sorry the PO C over here is five
388:23 - Okay so
388:25 - that didn't make for a very good example
388:27 - because it went the other
388:29 - way so what I'll need to do is I want to
388:32 - delete this pull request this one's kind
388:33 - of useless we'll close that and what I
388:36 - actually need is I need some kind of
388:37 - change in this repo to go the other way
388:40 - all right because I need to see if that
388:42 - other number is going to increment we'll
388:43 - go back to this main repo and remember
388:46 - we created this issue this issue number
388:47 - was seven and so I want to see what the
388:49 - next PR in here is going to be we did
388:52 - just close this
388:53 - one but maybe we need a PR for just
388:57 - something locally not something across
388:59 - across uh Forks okay so what I'm going
389:01 - to do is I'm going to go ahead and go to
389:04 - code and I'm going to go to
389:07 - branches and I need to just move over to
389:10 - another Branch we have some junk
389:12 - branches here I'm just going to go ahead
389:13 - and delete
389:15 - them okay and I'll even get rid of this
389:18 - one here we don't need that I'm G to
389:20 - give this a
389:21 - refresh and so now what I want to do is
389:23 - create a new branch I'm just going to
389:25 - just say um number test and so this will
389:29 - be off of Main and then what we can do
389:32 - is go over to our code and I just need
389:34 - to make some kind of change so I'll I'll
389:36 - switch over to number
389:38 - test and what I want to do here is I
389:43 - want to just change something so I'm
389:45 - going to go into our get crash
389:47 - course go our hello and I'm going to go
389:51 - edit this
389:52 - file I We'll add another X
389:55 - Mark we'll commit those changes and so
389:58 - now we have a reason to make a pull
389:59 - request we'll make a new pull request
390:01 - and this one I just want it to be in the
390:04 - current repo I don't want to go uh
390:07 - somewhere else so very straightforward
390:09 - here here to there and let's make note
390:12 - of the number that is used so here it's
390:16 - using the number eight so I want to show
390:18 - you this
390:19 - is seven and this is eight so they are
390:22 - indeed pulling from the same number pool
390:24 - so so just so you know like you might
390:26 - expect clean numbers as you're going up
390:28 - with your issues and you're like what
390:30 - happened to this number is it unlucky
390:31 - number did GitHub get rid of it no it's
390:33 - probably over in your pull request okay
390:36 - we can also link pull request we'll
390:38 - probably do this later again but you can
390:40 - link your issues to your pull requests
390:43 - um if you go to development here on the
390:44 - right hand side you can just click here
390:46 - and Associate this way so I can go here
390:49 - and then choose a poll request it's not
390:52 - showing up for some reason do we not
390:54 - have a requests over here we do it's
390:56 - right here yeah go back over here
390:59 - development oh did I click the I clicked
391:01 - the wrong repo that's why and so I can
391:04 - choose this one here and we'll apply it
391:07 - so now this is linked um to that there
391:11 - and it shows the link there as well you
391:13 - might able be able to link them up here
391:15 - as well I'm not exactly sure so what I'm
391:17 - going to do I just want to unlink that
391:19 - for a
391:20 - second okay and I want to see what
391:23 - happens if we were to um
391:25 - if we were to go and update this and
391:27 - then put
391:29 - in like it says
391:32 - closes eight right and we do this would
391:36 - this link it I mean we have eight here
391:38 - it's showing
391:39 - there
391:41 - okay
391:44 - and Link a poll request that it now is
391:47 - closed so did it just do that like I'm
391:49 - not 100% sure did it do that I'm going
391:51 - to go ahead and just delete this for a
391:52 - second
391:53 - edit
391:55 - update because I can't
391:57 - tell but that's what I want to know so
391:59 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to do
392:00 - this one more time and delete this issue
392:04 - okay and I want to see if that takes any
392:06 - kind of effect so we'll make a new one
392:08 - we'll just say uh cool
392:10 - issue it'll say closes pound
392:14 - 8 okay I just want to see if it's linked
392:17 - in any way so it doesn't look like it's
392:19 - linking any way there but it could be
392:22 - that um a particular commit could close
392:25 - a ticket for sure um but I thought
392:27 - something with poll requests would
392:28 - happen here but anyway what I'm going to
392:31 - do here is I'm just going to edit this
392:33 - to say my cool issue and what I want to
392:37 - do is I want to see when we close this
392:40 - poll
392:43 - request when we close this poll request
392:46 - will it close this ticket okay so a link
392:49 - of poll request now that will close this
392:50 - ticket so we'll go over here and I'm
392:53 - going to go here and I want to
392:55 - merge and Pull and confirm now we could
392:58 - just close it but I don't think that's
393:00 - the same thing so I'm going to go over
393:01 - to our
393:03 - issue and I think our issue's now been
393:05 - closed so it was closed when we
393:08 - closed that pull request another thing
393:11 - we we should check is is using
393:14 - keywords there's something called
393:15 - keywords issues I think could also be in
393:18 - PRS
393:21 - GitHub using keywords in issues and
393:24 - polar request suggesting that it could
393:25 - be used for either or so to link a poll
393:27 - request to an issue show the fix
393:29 - automatically closes when someone merges
393:31 - the poll request type one of the
393:33 - following keywords followed by a a
393:36 - reference issue so close the issue when
393:38 - someone merges the poll
393:41 - request okay so that's something we
393:43 - could try
393:44 - doing when someone merges the poll
393:47 - request so what I'm going to do is I'm
393:49 - going to reopen this
393:50 - issue
393:52 - and um by the way just because we have a
393:55 - pull request doesn't mean we can't you
393:57 - uh push to It Again by like you can use
393:59 - a p request and push well we'll talk
394:00 - about that when we get in the pull
394:01 - request section I don't want to confuse
394:02 - anybody here so I'm going to go back
394:05 - over to uh here I'm going to switch back
394:07 - to number test and we're going to go
394:09 - into get crash course and we're going to
394:11 - go into hello we're going to
394:14 - edit uh I guess it's already here can we
394:17 - just edit it right there no edit another
394:21 - exclamation mark commit the changes
394:23 - commit it good we're going to go over to
394:25 - PLL request make a new pull
394:27 - request and uh keep it real simple we
394:30 - want to go to the keeping the same repo
394:33 - and we want this to be number test we'll
394:36 - create that pull
394:38 - request and I mean I want this to
394:42 - close but it says when we merge here it
394:44 - says to link a request to an issue show
394:47 - that the fixes in progress or
394:48 - automatically closes the issue when
394:50 - someone merges so I'm going to say fixes
394:55 - I and we're going to put a pound here
394:57 - this will be cool issue that's our new
394:59 - one and I want to see if that links it
395:01 - in any weird way it's not weird but in
395:04 - some way so I'm going to go back over to
395:07 - my issues we'll take a look
395:09 - here and notice it says link a poll
395:12 - request now that will close this issue
395:16 - so you know it was saying that it had to
395:17 - be at the time of merge but did does it
395:20 - really because it looks like it just has
395:22 - to be somewhere in the comment here to
395:23 - link it so links pull request to issue
395:25 - but not the other way around right so it
395:27 - has to be in in that uh Direction okay
395:32 - um so I think that's really important to
395:33 - note the other thing is that the exam
395:35 - will probably ask you to remember these
395:37 - words notice we have close fix resolve
395:39 - close fix resolve if you can remember
395:41 - that then you'll be able to pick it out
395:44 - in a list because they might show like
395:45 - just closes and then fixed and then
395:47 - resolves and try to mess with your mind
395:50 - uh but understand those three there but
395:52 - hopefully that gives you a little bit
395:53 - more uh information about issues um very
395:57 - obvious things you can assign people to
395:59 - an issue you can apply labels to an
396:03 - issue if you want you can uh associate
396:05 - to a project you can associate to a
396:08 - milestone and we saw that it can be part
396:10 - of a branch and a pull
396:12 - request um all pretty clear stuff we can
396:15 - pin issues I'm sure we'll talk about
396:17 - that later on but if I pin it it will
396:19 - then go to the top here if I go back
396:21 - over to my issues here it is a few other
396:24 - things things um is the the Sorting
396:27 - stuff here you really should know how to
396:29 - filter uh filter with some of these
396:32 - options here and I'm going to just tell
396:34 - you on the exam they they said Hey how
396:36 - do you filter issues like what options
396:39 - do you have to filter and they gave you
396:40 - a list and you had to pick from them I
396:42 - really didn't like that thought it was
396:43 - kind of a dirty question but that was
396:45 - something you might have to answer you
396:46 - might have to know this query language a
396:48 - little bit so just understand that those
396:49 - might show up on the exam but definitely
396:52 - linking is something that we show in the
396:54 - exam for
396:55 - sure um and creating a branch okay so
396:58 - hopefully that gives you a better idea
397:00 - of issues there all right
397:04 - [Music]
397:08 - ciao so something you can do is you can
397:10 - create um a branch from an issue and or
397:14 - you can associate an issue to a branch
397:17 - uh what you can do is you can go ahead
397:18 - and create a branch on your issue then
397:21 - it will allow you to uh name the branch
397:24 - notice that it's going to have the
397:26 - number of the issue in front of it which
397:28 - is a common convention when making
397:30 - feature branches so people know what
397:32 - issues or ticket it goes back to this is
397:35 - not just with GitHub this is with any
397:37 - project tracker that has to do with code
397:39 - a common workflow is creating feature or
397:41 - bug uh branches but Define your issues
397:43 - up front and then you quickly create
397:44 - those branches and that way you don't
397:46 - forget to make those branches creates
397:47 - great habits so you define the feature
397:49 - bug then you go ahead and you make the
397:51 - branch there you
397:53 - go
397:55 - [Music]
397:57 - hey this is Angie Brown and this fall
397:58 - along I want to create a uh Branch from
398:00 - an issue we've probably done it before
398:02 - but let's do it again because maybe
398:04 - we'll learn something different if we do
398:06 - it slightly different um and it seems to
398:08 - be a very important topic for the exam
398:10 - so we do have this issue from before I'm
398:13 - just going to go ahead and close this as
398:14 - this one is uh done and I'm going to go
398:18 - back up here and we'll make a new issue
398:20 - we'll call this
398:22 - issue cooler issue issue right cooler
398:26 - issue and what I want to do is I want
398:30 - to create a branch so what's interesting
398:32 - is you can link a branch you can link a
398:34 - branch or a pull request I think we've
398:36 - created a branch this way but we've
398:38 - never uh done it the other way so let's
398:40 - just go ahead and create a branch and
398:41 - you can see that's pretty
398:42 - straightforward I don't think that's
398:44 - super exciting um notice that the branch
398:46 - has to be one of the branches you have
398:48 - here uh so sorry I guess you could
398:51 - actually associate to an existing Branch
398:52 - so um repository
398:56 - destination change Branch Source oh
398:58 - sorry what you're branching from okay
399:00 - that's what that's for but yeah we can
399:02 - create a branch there pretty
399:04 - straightforward uh but let's do this the
399:07 - other way we're going to go ahead and
399:08 - create the branch first and then connect
399:10 - an issue to it so I'm going to go here
399:13 - and I'm going to say
399:14 - new super cool
399:18 - Branch super cool and we'll go ahead and
399:21 - do that we'll go ahead and create our
399:23 - issue this will be
399:25 - whoops this will be our super cool
399:30 - issue
399:35 - right and I'll just put cool in here
399:38 - that's emojis that's how you use them
399:40 - and uh what we can
399:42 - do here is then click here and it says
399:46 - link Branch or poll request most times
399:48 - we've been doing this with poll requests
399:49 - but we'll do this with um uh a branch
399:52 - now and so look at the icon that tells
399:54 - you what it is so these are um these
399:58 - blue
399:58 - ones I I pretend like I know these blue
400:01 - ones are our um branches these purple
400:07 - ones are our pull requests and this
400:10 - green one here is I have no idea is that
400:12 - another issue can you link issues to
400:14 - other
400:17 - issues can you no that's not that that
400:20 - is so that's something what is that is
400:24 - it like an old one no I know we made
400:27 - that what is it number
400:31 - test number test what is
400:36 - that okay we should find well what that
400:39 - is we'll go here and so now we've
400:41 - applied a branch the other
400:43 - direction okay but uh I really want to
400:46 - know what that number testing is it's
400:49 - another Branch okay so then why was it
400:51 - colored differently that's what I want
400:53 - to know
400:55 - maybe it was a branch maybe it's a
400:56 - branch that's been merged in before
400:58 - that's probably why so that's probably
401:00 - what they're doing so they're both
401:02 - branches it's just that branch has
401:03 - already been merged again so you'd be
401:04 - using an Old Branch that You' that
401:06 - you've already done I think that's what
401:07 - they're trying to indicate there they
401:09 - don't really like tell you about these
401:11 - uh icons anywhere if they are in the
401:12 - documentation they are super hidden but
401:14 - I want to go back here and take a
401:18 - look see now this one's blue this one's
401:21 - blue yeah so these ones I think are ones
401:23 - that have been
401:24 - um number test green so green is it's
401:26 - already been merged in you can see the
401:28 - icon it shows that it looks like it's
401:29 - been merged in and it shows that it's a
401:31 - branch so this is actually a uh a branch
401:33 - that has been merged okay but uh yeah
401:36 - hopefully we learned something new or we
401:38 - got a bit extra practice and I'll see
401:40 - you in the next one okay
401:41 - [Music]
401:45 - ciao so with search and filters you can
401:48 - quickly sort through a lot of your
401:50 - issues there's a bunch of predefined
401:51 - ones that are there or you can use a
401:54 - syntax language uh called the advanced
401:55 - search syntax and roll up to find uh
401:58 - something more advanced the exam at
402:00 - least for me absolutely asked me both
402:02 - the syntax and the predefined filters um
402:05 - and specifically they use the filter
402:07 - names that were here so
402:11 - um with those but there's also sorting
402:13 - right so I'm not showing that here but
402:15 - they I also got an exam question asking
402:17 - me about what you could sort by uh but
402:20 - uh yeah you definitely need to know all
402:22 - those three things and we'll take a
402:23 - close closer look on maybe a bigger repo
402:25 - so that we can get some practice
402:27 - [Music]
402:30 - okay hey it's Andrew Brown and this fall
402:33 - along we're going to look at how to
402:34 - search and
402:36 - filter issues so I'm going to make my
402:38 - way over to rails because they should
402:39 - have a lot of issues 49 455 that's not a
402:43 - small amount and let's take a look at
402:45 - what we can filter by so we have open
402:47 - issues and pull requests so we can do
402:50 - that we have your issues so things that
402:53 - your assigned to we have your pull
402:57 - requests which I'm confused why oh you
403:00 - know what it is it's flipping between
403:02 - the two things so it's suggesting that
403:03 - these interfaces are the same I didn't
403:05 - even notice that okay so your pro
403:08 - request notice we change tabs we go back
403:10 - to your issues over here we have
403:13 - everything assigned to you and then
403:15 - everything you're mentioned in okay so
403:18 - assigned
403:20 - mentioned the ones you opened and then
403:23 - things that are open for po requester
403:24 - issues it's weird that like they have
403:27 - this one join but this one's separate I
403:28 - have no idea why um another thing that
403:31 - we should make note of is these filters
403:33 - here because they might say hey are you
403:35 - able to filter based on Project hey are
403:37 - you able to filter based on aign or sort
403:40 - or filter so these are basically um
403:43 - these are broad filters and then these
403:45 - are um very specific filters like very
403:49 - very specific and then we have our sort
403:51 - over here where we can sort some stuff
403:54 - but yeah you'll need to know this
403:56 - stuff uh this and the advanced search
403:59 - syntax so I I have some written out here
404:01 - we can play around with it a bit and see
404:04 - what we can do so let's see what we can
404:06 - do we can say is
404:09 - issue and that seems to be a thing so
404:12 - we'll go ahead and hit enter there so
404:14 - yes it's an issue um we could say no
404:21 - assigning okay so nobody's assigned to
404:24 - it we could put
404:26 - label active support so we're filtering
404:29 - based on this one here let's see if that
404:31 - works cool and I wonder if we could do
404:34 - like some generic text search um so
404:36 - maybe we could just say replace on the
404:38 - end
404:39 - here and notice that it's picking up I
404:41 - think that like let's try
404:43 - caches
404:46 - caches okay so we're kind of getting
404:48 - that it might be the contents of it but
404:50 - it is trying to search for it we could
404:52 - also say something like there's zero
404:54 - comments so let's say comments
404:56 - zero so those ones have zero comments
404:59 - and so that gives you an idea of how uh
405:02 - that works um so you know hopefully that
405:04 - is pretty straightforward but yeah the
405:05 - filters is the same for pull requests
405:07 - and
405:08 - issues um and you know if there's more
405:11 - to it we could click here and you can
405:12 - read through all the options uh but for
405:14 - the most part you can pretty much figure
405:16 - it out and guess based on what kind of
405:18 - options you have over here that you
405:19 - could filter by but you'll see you in
405:21 - the next one okay ciao
405:26 - [Music]
405:27 - so issue templates are markdown
405:29 - templates that are pre-loaded for new
405:30 - issues they help ensure users creating
405:33 - issues provide all relevant and expected
405:35 - information and if the exam if want to
405:38 - use the exam language there was a exam
405:40 - question that says you can coarse
405:42 - terrible word but cerse people into
405:45 - writing what you want them to write so
405:47 - here is an example it's a markdown
405:49 - template that's all it's really doing is
405:50 - loading in that markdown template and
405:52 - the idea is that they you can have
405:54 - different issue templates so a new
405:55 - category will appear here of issue and
405:58 - then people open it up from there some
406:00 - of these are kind of linked to stuff so
406:02 - like that report to vulnerability is not
406:03 - necessarily an issue template um but bug
406:06 - report and feature request are but
406:07 - they're like built-in ones I should
406:09 - point out that on the exam they'll
406:12 - probably ask you what are the three
406:14 - default ones and these are the three so
406:16 - you should remember report bug or bug
406:18 - report feature request and uh report
406:21 - security vulnerability because now that
406:22 - they remembering it they def definitely
406:23 - asked me that um you create issue
406:26 - templates here in that folder so you
406:28 - make a folder called issue templates all
406:31 - in caps and you put them in there
406:33 - originally used to just have one called
406:34 - issue template. MD some older projects
406:36 - still have that but everything goes in
406:38 - that folder and we're going to find out
406:39 - that issue forms also go in there as
406:41 - well which is the beta replacement for
406:43 - this feature that I never could get
406:44 - working um G GitHub has a wizard guy to
406:48 - easily create issue templates so you
406:51 - don't really have to write um
406:54 - uh markdown there but uh it will spit
406:56 - out markdown but we'll take a look at
406:58 - what that looks like uh since I haven't
406:59 - used it in a while but we'll find out
407:00 - here shortly
407:02 - [Music]
407:05 - okay let's take a look at issue forms
407:08 - this is the evolution of issue templates
407:10 - and it uses a yaml formatted file to
407:11 - create issue forms for stricter entry
407:13 - for issue information as the time of
407:16 - this video this is a beta feature so it
407:17 - might go away what's odd is that they
407:19 - want to include it in the exam so beta
407:22 - features can can appear in uh GitHub
407:25 - certifications which I disagree with but
407:27 - that's what they're doing and so here is
407:29 - an example of the template I don't think
407:31 - they'll ask you the format of the
407:33 - template um like GitHub actions they'll
407:35 - definitely do but not for issue forms
407:37 - because it's so new and that's kind of a
407:39 - visualization of what that would look
407:41 - like so there you
407:43 - [Music]
407:46 - go hey this is angrew brown and this
407:48 - fall along we're going to take a look at
407:50 - issue templates and we'll try to do
407:52 - issue forms I never got working the
407:53 - first time I tried it but maybe it'll
407:55 - work this time around let's go take uh
407:57 - uh a peek and see who would might have
408:00 - some existing uh issue templates I know
408:03 - rails does but the thing is rails is
408:05 - such an old um or mature product that
408:09 - they've had this template this issues
408:11 - template file in here forever and they
408:13 - don't have it in the uh the place where
408:15 - you expect it to be so it would be in
408:16 - the dock GitHub folder but it's right
408:18 - here they don't have a a um a folder of
408:22 - them so this is actually the old way so
408:24 - they say you're using an old version of
408:25 - issue template use the new way of doing
408:26 - it so that's not recommended anymore
408:29 - okay but um maybe a better project might
408:31 - be like
408:33 - Forum uh if forum's still around and
408:36 - kick in because I feel like they would
408:38 - utilize this if we go over to our issues
408:42 - let's say we want to make a new
408:44 - issue we have
408:46 - um this one this one looks like a
408:50 - template okay so maybe this is a
408:52 - template that they're using and we have
408:53 - that format there and we might just
408:56 - steal this so we can save some time
408:58 - later on so I'm going to leave this tab
409:02 - open I just don't feel like making a new
409:05 - one and if we go over to their code
409:07 - let's take a look and see what they have
409:09 - in their GitHub folder and in here they
409:11 - have issue template and there it is they
409:14 - also have a config AML so there's a
409:15 - little bit more going on there than than
409:17 - I thought um is that is this the new
409:21 - style that looks like an issue for
409:24 - I think that's an issue form okay well
409:26 - maybe we'll grab both of theirs and see
409:28 - if we can get these both to work but I
409:30 - didn't see that when we opened an issue
409:32 - let's go back here and take a look new
409:35 - issue
409:37 - um I don't see it so I'm not 100% sure
409:42 - on
409:43 - that but if it's a yaml file then that's
409:45 - what it should
409:47 - be unless that's something else and I'm
409:49 - just maybe it's something else I don't
409:51 - know so anyway let's go ahead and do
409:53 - that for our own repo so I'm going to go
409:55 - here into GitHub GitHub
409:57 - examples and I'm going to actually open
409:59 - this up in GitHub Dev I can do that by
410:01 - hitting the period by the way if you hit
410:04 - comma it doesn't do anything um just
410:06 - going to try that I don't know I'm just
410:08 - convinced maybe a comma does something
410:09 - it doesn't do anything we'll hit period
410:11 - and that's going to open up
410:23 - here and I want to go onto the left hand
410:26 - side and we're going to make a new
410:27 - folder here we're going to call this dog
410:30 - ignore or sorry dog ignore
410:35 - doget
410:36 - Hub that's a file that's not a folder
410:39 - let's try that again we'll say new
410:42 - folder. GitHub and then inside of that
410:45 - we'll make a new folder called it
410:47 - issue
410:50 - template is that what it's supposed to
410:51 - be called issue template yes yeah and
410:54 - then I'll make a new one in here and
410:56 - we'll say
410:59 - um I'm trying to think of something
411:02 - secret we'll call this secret MD and I
411:07 - mean I said I was going to copy this I
411:09 - guess we don't really need to we just
411:10 - make our own and I'm just going to put
411:13 - anything in here so just say welcome to
411:15 - the
411:17 - secret uh
411:19 - submissions submit to Secrets
411:26 - okay I don't know if that's a
411:28 - thing I'm just going to put cool here I
411:31 - think that should render out because
411:32 - that's uh that's something there and I'm
411:34 - going to go ahead and add
411:38 - this commit or add issue
411:43 - template go ahead and commit and pull
411:47 - good I want to go back to this repo I'll
411:50 - open another tab here and if I go open
411:53 - an
411:53 - issue do we have
411:56 - it it didn't show us uh
412:00 - options must have done something wrong
412:02 - let's go back
412:03 - here do GitHub issue
412:07 - template do GitHub issue
412:12 - template I made an MD file
412:17 - yeah I don't
412:19 - understand it looks right to me
412:24 - okay so we'll go back over here maybe we
412:26 - got something wrong that's okay and
412:29 - we'll rename
412:30 - this I mean I don't think
412:37 - so secret.
412:40 - MD what if we um refresh the page I'm
412:43 - just going to do a hard refresh here I
412:44 - just don't trust
412:46 - it new
412:49 - issue R up to any issue templates
412:54 - okay let's go to our settings well hold
412:57 - on is this repo private or public
413:01 - because that could
413:02 - matter this is a
413:07 - um oh this is a private repo I think you
413:11 - cannot change the visibility of this
413:13 - Fork is this public or
413:16 - private no it's it's
413:19 - public oh I'm
413:21 - um
413:24 - I've added this here this is my Fork
413:27 - yeah it is here but it's not showing up
413:29 - here maybe it only works if it's on the
413:32 - the main one so what I'm going to do is
413:33 - I'm going to make a pull
413:35 - request and uh we're going to just
413:37 - create a new one and uh update and just
413:41 - say update here going create that one
413:45 - and maybe that's going to resolve our
413:46 - issue I don't want to get confused no we
413:47 - only have one pull request and we'll go
413:49 - over to this one I think it's because
413:50 - it's a fork and so maybe it only works
413:52 - on the the top level one and we'll go
413:55 - ahead and we'll just merge this P
413:57 - request and now we'll take a look and
413:59 - see what happens so we'll go to Issues
414:02 - new new issue no it's not showing us
414:06 - anything it's a public
414:08 - repo it's in the right
414:11 - folder what else does it want from me
414:14 - let's go
414:16 - here
414:21 - um
414:27 - yeah what could I be doing wrong that is
414:30 - a good
414:34 - question is because this is not a
414:36 - community
414:43 - project okay issue templates not
414:51 - working
414:54 - this is a legacy workflow to create
414:55 - issue templates we recommend using the
414:56 - upgraded issue template Builder okay if
414:59 - you use a legacy workflow to manually do
415:00 - that well let's click on
415:05 - that create an issue template you can
415:07 - create an issue template as an issue
415:09 - template subdirectory uh in any of the
415:12 - supported folders to contain multiple
415:13 - issues so it can be in multiple
415:16 - folders
415:18 - okay do
415:20 - GitHub I swear I've done this before to
415:22 - make it issue template visible in the
415:24 - repository do this commit the
415:27 - [Music]
415:29 - changes I'm like going crazy here
415:31 - because I definitely I made it um and
415:33 - use the template query parameter to
415:35 - specify the template that will fill the
415:37 - issue
415:40 - body okay do we need maybe a um a like
415:44 - maybe we need a yaml file let's go back
415:46 - over to
415:51 - form I don't think
415:54 - so do we need some front matter maybe in
415:57 - the yeah that might be something we need
415:58 - in the in the file here yeah okay you
416:01 - know what we're missing we're just
416:02 - missing some front matter that's what it
416:04 - is that's what it is okay so I'm going
416:07 - to go back over
416:09 - to this one I guess and what we need is
416:12 - some front matter in here and that's why
416:13 - it's not working front matter is um is
416:16 - this it can go into yaml files I think
416:18 - or maybe not markdown files and this is
416:20 - like yaml stuff you put the top here so
416:22 - just just say secret secret uh secret
416:31 - issue
416:33 - submits a
416:37 - secret um and I think the idea here is
416:39 - you can automatically assign labels so
416:41 - maybe we have like a secret label we'll
416:43 - have to make a label for that because we
416:45 - don't have one uh want to go back
416:47 - to oh let's use that command I'm going
416:50 - to do control K there we go I love this
416:53 - and I'm going to type in um examples
416:56 - just like a fast way to navigate to
416:58 - stuff I got remember to do that more um
417:01 - and we want to make a new label over
417:05 - here I'm going to call this one
417:10 - secret I'm on the wrong
417:12 - repo control
417:14 - K I'm G to try this again
417:18 - example I want
417:20 - mine why is it only showing this one all
417:24 - right well I guess that feature is not
417:25 - as great as I thought it was we'll go
417:27 - over here and I'll go to issues and then
417:30 - I'll go to labels and I'll add a new one
417:32 - called
417:36 - secret
417:38 - and choose something crazy maybe
417:42 - that okay so there's our new
417:47 - secret I don't need any signies we'll
417:50 - leave that blank we'll save that
417:54 - update issue
417:56 - template commit and
417:59 - push we'll go back over
418:02 - here and now we go to issues and we say
418:05 - new issue there we go now what's
418:08 - interesting is that we weren't getting
418:09 - those three default ones which I'm
418:11 - really surprised if we go to edit
418:13 - templates okay they go there but they
418:15 - usually have like a
418:17 - builder I remember them having a builder
418:19 - before and I don't know where it is now
418:22 - so that's really
418:28 - interesting well we can go back to the
418:30 - other one like this works I'm sure this
418:32 - works we fill it in there it is what I'm
418:34 - surprised is we don't have those three
418:36 - default ones there and I know again on
418:38 - the exam they showed that and I could
418:40 - have swore that they would have set you
418:41 - up with that but maybe it only happens
418:43 - if this is a community project which
418:45 - again I'm not even sure how to uh set
418:47 - that up um I kind of
418:50 - forget so place to set community project
418:57 - Community
418:58 - project yeah I'm not
419:01 - sure um
419:03 - insights
419:05 - Community oh here it is to enable
419:07 - discussions uh enable discussions to
419:09 - unlock Community insights okay sure
419:11 - we'll enable
419:13 - that I don't really want to enable that
419:15 - right now but maybe that's what would
419:17 - bring those issues in later we can go
419:19 - check I'm just again I just want to see
419:20 - why I can't see those default ones
419:23 - and we'll go
419:26 - here and we'll go back to this
419:30 - repo uh
419:33 - GitHub
419:35 - examples
419:37 - and well first I just want to open an
419:39 - issue over
419:40 - here no templates fine let's go over to
419:43 - community
419:48 - again issue templates add what if we
419:50 - click it here okay so this is where the
419:53 - Builder is it's weird that um it didn't
419:56 - show another place okay so here's some a
419:57 - couple of the default ones so we can go
419:59 - here and do this and then there's custom
420:02 - template so maybe these are the three
420:04 - ones because I said the other one was
420:05 - like vulnerability one but maybe it's
420:08 - these three because it was trying to ask
420:09 - you like what were the default ones that
420:11 - were there so I think maybe I was wrong
420:15 - in that slide and it's really custom
420:17 - template we'll go ahead and we'll just
420:19 - propose those changes and say continue
420:22 - and now if we go over to
420:25 - issues all right that looks fine I
420:27 - wonder have a little icon there maybe
420:29 - there's some way to do that now we can
420:30 - edit the templates over here not really
420:33 - though I thought we could do a little
420:34 - bit more there but we now have uh those
420:36 - in here secrets in here as well but of
420:38 - course this one doesn't have a front
420:39 - matter that's why it's not working we're
420:41 - going to go back and switch over to our
420:43 - old one
420:44 - here and
420:46 - um what I want to do is I want to try to
420:51 - get that issue form work because I've
420:52 - never gotten one of those working before
420:53 - so I'm going to look up issue
420:55 - form and I want to just give it another
420:57 - go on GitHub here issue
420:59 - form I'm just looking for an example one
421:02 - so here's an example of one I'm going to
421:04 - grab this whole one here I'll copy it
421:07 - I'm going to go back over to here and
421:10 - I'm going to make a new one we'll just
421:11 - call this one extra MD it's actually
421:20 - yaml okay we'll paste this in we'll save
421:23 - it and we'll just say extra bug report
421:25 - at the top so it can distinguish it from
421:27 - the other
421:28 - one and we'll go ahead and Commit
421:32 - This try and
421:35 - add an issue
421:39 - form like I like the idea of issue forms
421:42 - but uh you know again beta feature so
421:44 - why why is it in the exam um and we'll
421:46 - see if we can get this to work this was
421:48 - committed on this one here so I'm going
421:50 - to go back over to uh
421:54 - this
421:56 - one come on let me I have like a my my
422:00 - mouse is sticking that's why I'm getting
422:01 - a double click okay and actually I'm in
422:03 - the count that I want to be I'm just
422:04 - trying to get to that repo again so
422:06 - click over
422:07 - here and we'll go back into
422:10 - ours and now we'll go to issues and I
422:13 - want to see if that other one shows
422:15 - up it does okay finally and now we
422:19 - actually have those fields so that's
422:20 - pretty nice um before I had like the
422:24 - hardest time getting this to work but
422:25 - now it's working no problem so I think
422:27 - that covers it for issue forms and issue
422:29 - templates and I will see you in the next
422:31 - one
422:32 - [Music]
422:35 - ciao so for GitHub issues you're able to
422:38 - pin them and you can pin up to three
422:40 - once you pin them they show up the top
422:41 - and it makes it really easy uh to find
422:44 - the most important issues that's pretty
422:47 - much it
422:50 - okay
422:52 - hey this is Angie Brown and we are
422:54 - taking a look at poll requests often
422:56 - abbreviated as PR and you'll see that a
422:59 - lot it's very common uh is a formal
423:01 - process to put forth changes that can be
423:03 - manually or automatically reviewed
423:05 - before it's accepted into your base
423:08 - Branch your main branch here so here are
423:11 - pull requests in GitHub and the benefits
423:13 - of pull requests is collaboration review
423:16 - or collaborative review so enhances code
423:18 - quality through team discussions and
423:20 - peer feedback chck it it tracks changes
423:24 - says change tracking but tracks changes
423:26 - provides a record of code changes and
423:28 - related discussions automated testing
423:31 - enables integration with tools for
423:32 - automated checks and tests controlled
423:35 - integration manages safe and reviewed
423:38 - merging of code changes open source
423:40 - friendly simplifies contributions and
423:42 - collaboration in open source projects I
423:44 - want to point out the poor request is
423:46 - not necessarily A git feature but a a
423:49 - workflow and GitHub has built a bunch of
423:51 - features around pull requests pull
423:54 - requests aren't unique to GitHub um it's
423:56 - just part of the workflow and and
423:58 - whatever they want to build around it
423:59 - they can build around it and that has to
424:00 - do with other tools that do this like
424:03 - Jura and bit bucket or whatever other
424:05 - tools like gitlab and stuff
424:07 - [Music]
424:11 - okay so we can create pull requests
424:13 - using the GitHub CLI uh that's one
424:16 - really cool way of doing it the other
424:18 - way is using uh the GitHub website so
424:20 - you go to the pull request Tab and your
424:21 - repo you create a new pull request and
424:24 - there it is I'm sure you know by now how
424:26 - to create a pull request because it's
424:27 - almost impossible not to show you that a
424:30 - 100 times over before we got to P
424:32 - requests here but that's how you create
424:33 - them one thing I want to point out is um
424:36 - uh that we have to set a base this is
424:39 - who we're going to merge into and ahead
424:41 - who uh the changes that we're going to
424:42 - pull into notice it says compare and
424:44 - we'll talk about that in the next slide
424:46 - about base and compare
424:50 - okay
424:52 - so base and compare determines the
424:54 - direction of the merge for a pull
424:56 - request and the idea is we have the base
424:59 - so is who you want to merge into this is
425:02 - usually the main branch or an
425:04 - environment specific Branch doesn't have
425:05 - to be main but usually main is base
425:08 - right um then we have compare this is
425:10 - what will be merg into base uh compare
425:13 - is choosing the head reference so notes
425:15 - before I called it head and if you look
425:18 - very closely it says choose the head
425:20 - reference so that's what compare is is
425:22 - this is usually a bug or feature Branch
425:24 - another thing that I need to point out
425:25 - is that you can compare across Forks uh
425:29 - this is useful if you're trying to
425:30 - contribute to an open source project so
425:32 - you're going to have the option to Cho
425:34 - the base uh repository um and the HUD
425:37 - repository to different uh repos from
425:41 - different owners so there you
425:43 - [Music]
425:46 - go so a draft pull request on GitHub is
425:49 - a feature that allows you to open a
425:51 - requests but Mark it as a work in
425:53 - progress uh the use cases for draft pull
425:56 - requests would be indicating work in
425:57 - progress so communicates the pull
425:59 - request is not ready for review or
426:00 - merging preventing premature merging
426:03 - ensures incomplete work is not
426:04 - accidentally merged facilitating early
426:06 - feedback and collaboration so people can
426:09 - talk about it continuous integration
426:10 - testing so maybe you want to just run uh
426:13 - a test code because when you have a pull
426:15 - request it's automatically going to
426:16 - start doing that transitioning to a
426:18 - ready state so easily switch from a
426:20 - draft to a ready for final review and
426:22 - merging organizing work in priorities
426:25 - help in managing and tracking ongoing
426:27 - work in large projects um draft requests
426:30 - draft pull request is a feature only for
426:32 - GitHub organization teams I believe you
426:34 - can use it in the uh free um free
426:38 - organizations that are public so we'll
426:39 - take a look and see if that's even
426:41 - possible uh if if I don't make a video
426:43 - then you know that it wasn't um there
426:45 - are two things you need to remember for
426:46 - this for the exam uh draft P requests
426:49 - cannot be merged code owners are not
426:51 - automatically requested to review draft
426:53 - pull requests okay so remember those two
426:56 - things because they will show up on your
426:57 - exam
426:59 - [Music]
427:02 - ciao hey this is Andrew Brown and in
427:04 - this fall along I want to take a look
427:07 - and see if we are able to open up a
427:09 - draft PLL request in our GitHub
427:11 - organization free account that we
427:13 - created so what I'm going to do is make
427:14 - a new repo because we're going to need
427:16 - to need we're going to need to have one
427:18 - in our um our one here and actually you
427:21 - know what I'm going to do no no no I'm
427:23 - just going to uh I don't want to make it
427:25 - too complicated I'm just going to make a
427:26 - new repost so just say uh like fun repo
427:31 - we'll say fun
427:33 - repo okay and this can be public we're
427:37 - going to make it public so just in case
427:39 - we need to have that so we can have that
427:41 - functionality because a lot of times
427:43 - public allows us to have um that paid
427:45 - functionality for free so what I want to
427:47 - do is take a look here and create a new
427:49 - pull request and see if we have the
427:51 - option we don't have any code so we'll
427:53 - need to create ourselves a new Branch
427:55 - I'm going to just do that in here in the
427:57 - UI and we'll just say uh Dev and we'll
428:00 - create that branch and then from here
428:03 - we'll go over and I want to switch over
428:06 - to Dev and then I want to edit the read
428:09 - me here and I'm just going to put in
428:12 - some exclamation marks we're going to
428:14 - commit that change looks good to me and
428:16 - then we're going to make our way over to
428:17 - pull request and we'll make a new pull
428:19 - request and what I want to know is if I
428:21 - can make a draft pull request so we'll
428:24 - say create new pull request and we'll
428:26 - drop this down and there it is okay so
428:29 - that's all it takes to create a draft
428:31 - pull request if there are code owners
428:33 - assigned they can't touch it noce I
428:35 - cannot merge it I'm clicking like a
428:37 - maniac it's not going to happen and that
428:39 - is draft pull requests so there you
428:42 - [Music]
428:45 - go let's talking about linking activity
428:48 - within a poll request so you can link
428:50 - issues to a poll request
428:51 - so that the state of the poll request
428:53 - will automatically close the issue we
428:54 - actually already did this before we
428:56 - looked at issues during we looked at
428:58 - issues and we're looking at it again so
429:00 - the idea is that you go up to
429:01 - development on that Cog and you choose
429:04 - um the issue or sorry the PLL request
429:06 - and then they're linked okay so that
429:08 - will close it the other way is via those
429:11 - supported keywords so if you have any of
429:14 - those words you put in the comment of
429:16 - the actual poll request um then that
429:19 - will close it it says the poll request
429:21 - EST must be on the default Branch okay
429:25 - the poll poll request must be on the
429:27 - default Branch for it to work I don't
429:29 - know if that's true I mean it worked for
429:31 - me when we did it but um however we did
429:34 - I guess it was on the default Branch but
429:36 - um uh anyway that's that I don't think
429:40 - there's any point of us showing this
429:41 - again because we've done it so many
429:43 - times but hopefully you know that you
429:44 - can do that and the direction to which
429:46 - it happens you're putting it in the uh
429:49 - body the description of the poll request
429:52 - um so it links to the issue okay
429:55 - [Music]
429:58 - ciao let us take a look here at the
430:01 - different statuses a poll request can be
430:03 - surprisingly this isn't an exam question
430:05 - but it's something you should know so
430:07 - let's go through them all the first is
430:09 - open the default status when a pull
430:10 - request is created it's open for
430:12 - discussion review draft indicates the P
430:14 - request is a work in progress and not
430:17 - ready for review close the P request has
430:19 - been closed without being merged this
430:21 - status is used when the proposed changes
430:23 - are no longer needed or the branch has
430:25 - been rejected merged the pull request
430:28 - changes has been merged into the target
430:30 - Branch the status indicates a successful
430:32 - conclusion of the pull request process
430:34 - change is requested this status is used
430:36 - during the review process when a
430:38 - reviewer request changes before the poll
430:40 - request can be merged review required
430:43 - indicates that the poll request requires
430:45 - a review before it can be merged this
430:47 - status is common in repos where reviews
430:49 - are mandatory part of the work flow
430:51 - approved the pull request has been
430:53 - reviewed and approved for merging by the
430:55 - required number of VI of reviewers
430:57 - conflict indicates that there are
430:59 - conflicts between the PLL request branch
431:01 - and the target branch that needs to be
431:02 - res resolved before merging ready for
431:05 - review a poll request initially marked
431:07 - as draft can be changed to this status
431:10 - once it's ready for review so that gives
431:12 - you an idea of the functionality of it
431:15 - and you kind of figure this out as you
431:16 - are working with PO requests but there
431:18 - you
431:20 - go
431:22 - [Music]
431:23 - so commenting in pull requests which is
431:25 - basically saying reviewing in pull
431:27 - requests because comments really do link
431:29 - up to reviewing but the idea is that uh
431:31 - you can um make a comment and in
431:34 - particular you can have it so that it is
431:36 - reviewing changes so when you are
431:38 - reviewing changes a review change a
431:39 - review can be a comment it can be an
431:41 - approval it can be request changes which
431:43 - has a comment attached to it so
431:45 - hopefully that is clear um that when
431:48 - you're doing P requests a comment is a
431:50 - review in sense okay it's submits
431:53 - General feedback without explicitly
431:55 - approval okay um another thing I need to
431:57 - note is that you can uh Mark comments on
432:02 - specific lines of code that could
432:06 - require a review to begin so there could
432:08 - be one where you're just saying
432:10 - something about the code or you could
432:11 - literally be saying hey you have to do
432:13 - something about this before we'll accept
432:15 - it
432:16 - [Music]
432:20 - okay so the code owners file is a GitHub
432:24 - specific file that defines individuals
432:26 - or teams that are responsible for
432:27 - specific code in a repo and so the idea
432:29 - is that they have the syntax that's
432:31 - similar to get ignore and when a polar
432:33 - request is open that modifies any files
432:36 - matching a pattern in the code owner's
432:38 - file get help automatically re request a
432:40 - review from the specified code owner the
432:42 - code owner files go in either the root
432:45 - project root. GitHub folder or doc
432:47 - directory um and so yeah I think this is
432:50 - something that is a paid feature it
432:52 - probably could be in free if we're
432:55 - talking about um organizations teams or
432:58 - sorry like free organizations that have
432:59 - to take a look but yeah it is a very
433:01 - powerful feature
433:03 - [Music]
433:06 - okay so when you're merging a poll
433:09 - request there are a few options so we
433:10 - have this drop down where we can either
433:12 - create a merge this will bring all
433:13 - commits over into the repo we have
433:16 - squash emerge which will have one commit
433:18 - to be added we have rebase emerge which
433:20 - will be added it and then do a rebase
433:22 - the third one is a more complex one so
433:24 - if you're not familiar with rebase
433:26 - you're probably going to be looking
433:27 - towards squash which is a good one uh
433:29 - the use case depends on your team's
433:31 - workflow they may prefer only a single
433:33 - commit uh added and so that's why you
433:35 - would want to have squash or rebase um
433:38 - but you do have a lot of options there
433:39 - for how you want to bring code in uh to
433:42 - your uh your base um your base
433:45 - [Music]
433:49 - there required reviewer is a way for you
433:52 - to explicitly say hey these people have
433:54 - to review this code otherwise it won't
433:56 - be accepted um and so you can assign or
434:00 - allow multiple required reviewers before
434:03 - code uh gets into a repo and a lot of
434:05 - times you can say it can't be the same
434:07 - person uh that submitted the code and
434:09 - it's not uncommon to have like four or
434:11 - five people that can be required
434:13 - reviewers and two or three have to um
434:15 - look it over before it gets accepted so
434:17 - here um I would be assigning myself and
434:19 - saying okay Omen King this this user has
434:23 - to um review the code and then from
434:26 - there as that user I would have to
434:28 - approve the changes and then from there
434:32 - it would change it to saying okay Omen
434:35 - king or angre brown approve the changes
434:37 - and so now you'll be able to press that
434:39 - merge button okay so there you
434:41 - [Music]
434:44 - go hey this is angrew brown in this
434:47 - video I want to uh do a little bit more
434:49 - with polar requests terms of code
434:52 - reviews and maybe we could try to get
434:54 - that code owners file to work or um you
434:57 - know just things that we didn't get a
434:58 - chance to really get Hands-On with as we
435:01 - have made PLL requests quite a bit but
435:03 - not from a reviewing kind of code proper
435:06 - way so what I want to do is I want to
435:08 - make my way over to our um uh our
435:12 - pretend organization and we're going to
435:14 - go ahead and create ourselves a new repo
435:16 - unless we already have one like the fun
435:18 - repo does that still exist it does so
435:20 - what will we'll do is go ahead and use
435:21 - this one and what I want to
435:24 - do before we do anything else is I want
435:26 - to add um or make sure that the
435:29 - collaborator is added uh to this repo
435:32 - here and so I'm going to go ahead and
435:34 - add Omen King
435:38 - okay and there I am and I'm going to go
435:40 - ahead and say this person can maintain
435:42 - this repo all right and now they're part
435:45 - of this repo so they're there and the
435:47 - reason I was able to add that very
435:48 - quickly was because they were already
435:49 - part of a team so or sorry that they're
435:52 - already part of our organization so I
435:55 - didn't have to send an invite and
435:57 - confirm they're not external from that
435:58 - so that was very easy um the next thing
436:01 - I want to do is I want to go through and
436:04 - uh create a pull
436:06 - request it looks like we already have
436:08 - one here so if we already have one I'm
436:09 - not going to make a new one if you have
436:10 - to you make a new one but here it says
436:13 - this poll request oh this is that draft
436:14 - one right so we can't do anything with
436:16 - this one right now uh so I'm just going
436:18 - to close that poll request I'm going to
436:20 - go over
436:21 - here a poll request I'm going to try to
436:23 - make a new poll request because we still
436:25 - might
436:26 - have yes we do from earlier and I'm
436:28 - going to go ahead and create that pull
436:29 - request okay and so we'll create that
436:33 - one and I want to say that this has to
436:35 - be reviewed by Omen King as soon as I do
436:38 - that notice we cannot proceed
436:42 - forward until that's uh ready there's
436:46 - another thing here that says ready for
436:47 - review so this pull request is still a
436:49 - work in progress so it's suggesting that
436:52 - this is a draft I guess I didn't notice
436:54 - but um it probably was still set to
436:56 - draft and so I ready for review okay so
437:02 - now uh Omen King should know that they
437:05 - need to approve it for this to work okay
437:09 - another thing that we could do is we
437:11 - could uh um require other things for
437:14 - approval so we could go ahead and add a
437:16 - Rule and Rule sets allow us to do that
437:19 - so there might be some things in here
437:21 - that we could set
437:25 - um require status checks to pass so that
437:28 - might be something that we might want to
437:29 - do and right now we don't actually have
437:31 - any status checks and so that's the
437:34 - reason why we can't we can't add that
437:36 - there so if I go
437:39 - back
437:40 - okay it would be nice to get some checks
437:42 - in here because that's the real value of
437:44 - pull request is having some kind of
437:45 - automation thing in here but I suppose
437:48 - we'd have to have like GitHub actions or
437:49 - something else so maybe we'll leave that
437:50 - for when we get to GitHub actions and
437:52 - integrate it there and we'll just
437:53 - continue on with the reviewers here so
437:56 - um I'm going to switch to my other
438:00 - account and I'm in this uh repon and
438:03 - saying oh I need to add a review so I
438:04 - can go here and let's say I don't like
438:07 - this change I'm G to go here and say
438:08 - request changes I don't like it make it
438:12 - better and so if I do
438:16 - this okay now it's saying in red hey you
438:19 - got to do something I you like it's not
438:21 - allowed to go through um and by the way
438:24 - it show it still shows merge pull
438:26 - request and I really don't want this to
438:28 - show up unless I've accepted it so maybe
438:32 - there's a setting that we can do in here
438:34 - I thought it would been that rule set
438:35 - that we could do that maybe there's
438:36 - something else that we can do to protect
438:38 - it always suggest updating the pull
438:40 - request branch
438:43 - no operation options I might not be able
438:46 - to do it because I'm not the admin so
438:47 - I'm going to go back and switch over to
438:49 - this I'll go back to settings and what
438:52 - I'm looking for is the option to say
438:54 - that it
438:56 - requires uh reviewers or otherwise it
438:59 - cannot be
439:00 - merged um and so that's what I'm looking
439:04 - for right now maybe it's under uh
439:08 - rules could be Branch protection as well
439:10 - let's take a look here require a pull
439:12 - request before
439:18 - merging um
439:21 - I really thought that there would have
439:22 - been a rule for
439:24 - this the reason I think that is because
439:27 - I'm used to
439:29 - um I'm used
439:31 - to uh
439:33 - using jira and and bit bucket and and
439:36 - they'll let you do that so maybe I can't
439:38 - set that I'm not sure restrict
439:42 - creation yeah so I'm really surprised I
439:44 - can't find that maybe it's there but I
439:45 - can't find it and that's totally fine
439:47 - let's go ahead and
439:49 - pretend uh you know we're going to go
439:51 - fix this issue so we go here and it says
439:53 - I don't like it make it better so how
439:55 - can we um submit that fix right and the
439:59 - way we're going to do that is we'll
440:00 - actually have to go to this branch and
440:02 - change something so we'll go
440:05 - here and make sure we're in the correct
440:08 - branch and in here I'm just going to go
440:10 - ahead and change it
440:12 - again okay commit the change commit and
440:16 - so now if we go back to the poll request
440:19 - we should be able to up update this poll
440:23 - request so I'm trying to do that
440:27 - here FSE
440:29 - changed normally what happens like and
440:32 - again it's because I'm thinking of jur
440:33 - and ATL scene is that you'd open another
440:35 - pull request and it would be the same
440:36 - one the same spot so I'm not sure if we
440:39 - can do
440:40 - that uh if I go Dev
440:43 - here because it's the same Branch right
440:46 - so if I do this it says view pull
440:49 - request
440:52 - how do I do
440:54 - this
441:00 - um and again it's because I'm expecting
441:02 - it to act like uh another piece of
441:04 - software and it's not doing what I think
441:06 - it's
441:07 - doing review changes I mean I could
441:10 - review my own that makes no sense review
441:11 - in code
441:12 - space so I guess the way it's going to
441:15 - work I really thought there'd be a back
441:17 - and forth there but I guess there's not
441:19 - is I suppose I would just have to go
441:21 - here and then approve
441:23 - it looks great okay so yeah I guess
441:27 - there's less process there than I
441:28 - thought and now that I'm happy with it I
441:30 - can go ahead and merge
441:32 - it so next question is can we make a
441:34 - code owner file and see how that
441:37 - works because I think that would be kind
441:39 - of unique to
441:43 - do sorry and so I believe that file is
441:46 - called code owners and uh what I'm going
441:49 - to do
441:51 - so I'm going to go ahead and create
441:53 - myself a new file here we'll say new
441:56 - file I'm going to
441:59 - say code
442:03 - owners and I'm just going to put an ason
442:06 - here and just say omen King and so the
442:08 - idea is that
442:10 - anytime anything changes it should
442:13 - assign it to Omen king that's what I'm
442:16 - thinking anyway so what we'll do is
442:19 - we'll go ahead and commit to these
442:23 - changes and we'll do this
442:27 - again okay and the idea is that if
442:31 - anything changes from that other person
442:34 - they they send a poll request I'm hoping
442:35 - that it's going to Auto assign now this
442:37 - might not work because it might be only
442:39 - a paid feature I don't know but we're
442:40 - going to try anyway so I'm going to go
442:42 - in the de
442:43 - branch and before I do anything I'm
442:46 - actually going to merge it the other way
442:48 - um I'm going to do that by opening
442:51 - up uh code spaces on dev and I'm just
442:54 - going to merge it back in into the
442:56 - direction because I'm not going to make
442:57 - a p request that goes in the opposite
442:58 - direction I'm not going to do that that
443:00 - doesn't make sense P requests are
443:01 - supposed to go into your main branch
443:08 - right so I'm just giving this a moment
443:12 - here and what I want to do is do get
443:15 - whoops get merge
443:18 - main I'll do get pull I'll do get check
443:23 - out main get
443:26 - pull just in
443:28 - case we'll say get check out
443:32 - main get merge main get push saying it's
443:37 - all up to date I'm not sure if I I'm
443:39 - convinced so I'm going to double check
443:41 - uh it's not showing our tree here so
443:42 - let's say get
443:44 - graph I really wish it would persist
443:46 - changes but hey it's code
443:49 - spaces
443:52 - and I'll go back over to here do I have
443:55 - this
443:55 - now and show it shows that uh Maine is
443:59 - ahead of death so it's totally lying to
444:02 - me they're definitely not in sync I knew
444:05 - this was not the case oh you know what I
444:07 - merged when I was in main so that's
444:09 - probably why uh get check out um Dev get
444:13 - merge main it's always great to have
444:15 - this open so we can see I'm going to go
444:17 - sync those
444:18 - changes okay just in case that didn't I
444:21 - can just get push just in case great
444:24 - that is in good shape I want to stop
444:25 - this
444:26 - environment
444:28 - stop good we're stopping
444:32 - it okay I'll go ahead and close that Tab
444:34 - out so now I have confidence that this
444:36 - code owners is in both I I just had a
444:39 - feeling I need to do that for some
444:40 - reason going to go ahead and just change
444:44 - this and we'll do
444:46 - that I'm going to go ahead and create a
444:48 - new pull request and I want to see
444:50 - whether it auto
444:52 - assigns we go here Dev create a pull
444:56 - request and look it auto assigned it so
444:58 - it says awaiting request a review from
445:00 - Omen Kang Omen Kang is a code owner Omen
445:02 - Kang will be requested when this pull
445:04 - request is created so that means the
445:05 - code owner file is working I don't need
445:07 - to create this pull request to know that
445:09 - and I think that's sufficient um the
445:11 - only last thing I would say is that you
445:13 - know people can comment directly on
445:15 - specific lines just remember that
445:16 - because they might ask you on the exam
445:18 - and that's about it we'll see you in the
445:19 - next one okay
445:21 - [Music]
445:24 - ciao hey everyone this is angrew brown
445:26 - and this fall along I want to show you
445:28 - uh some of the more advanced options for
445:29 - poll requests um in terms of the merge
445:32 - options and why you'd use one over the
445:35 - other um so what I'm going to do is I'm
445:37 - going to go into our GitHub examples and
445:39 - in this case we do need to open up uh
445:42 - some kind of
445:44 - editor I think we could get away with
445:46 - using
445:49 - it on my keyboard and that's going to
445:51 - open up the editor we're still going to
445:53 - need the repo open so I'm going to go
445:55 - here and wait for this to load and go to
445:59 - repo and so I I'm going to want to go
446:02 - over here for a moment I'm going to get
446:03 - rid of this um pull request so we're not
446:05 - getting mixed
446:06 - up and um I really want to be
446:10 - on development and I actually don't even
446:12 - know if I'm on that so I'm actually
446:13 - going to just close this stuff out I
446:15 - might have mucked this up and we'll
446:17 - close this out because I need to be on
446:18 - the correct Branch for this to work
446:20 - work
446:22 - and I mean we can do this and get up
446:24 - examples I'm going to do this in our
446:25 - other repo sorry I know I'm all over the
446:28 - place but I want to go back to our home
446:30 - and I want to go to our cool repo so I'm
446:33 - going to drop down our whoops our option
446:37 - here and I'm not sure why they don't
446:40 - never show those on the right hand side
446:41 - they really should we'll go here and I'm
446:44 - going to now um open po request and a
446:46 - new tab here and I'm going to go ahead
446:48 - and hit period and the reason why
446:51 - actually you know what we can't use uh
446:53 - GitHub Dev sorry we're going to have to
446:55 - open up code spaces because what I need
446:57 - is that visualization tool so we can see
446:59 - what we're doing so I'm going to go
447:01 - ahead and open up GitHub Cod spaces and
447:03 - we're going to have to wait a little
447:04 - while for this to start up unless it's
447:06 - already running that'd be really
447:08 - nice and I'll be back here in just a
447:10 - second when it loads okay all right so
447:12 - now that is ready um we want to make
447:16 - this a little bit easier to look at so
447:17 - I'm going to switch my theme as per
447:20 - usual we'll go to a darker theme there
447:23 - we go and um the other thing that I want
447:25 - to do here is I want to switch out to
447:28 - the dev Branch so say get check out Dev
447:31 - okay and another thing we're going to
447:32 - need is a tree so I'm going to go ahead
447:35 - and go to extensions here we'll say get
447:37 - graph because we need to make this
447:38 - really clear what's going on uh so I'm
447:41 - going to go here and install
447:44 - this
447:46 - okay and hopefully that installs nice
447:49 - and quick is it here not
447:51 - yet come on get graph
447:55 - install you can do get
447:58 - graph we want you there we go we want
448:00 - you here get graph so the idea is that I
448:02 - want to put a bunch of commits here and
448:04 - then we're going to merge them and see
448:06 - what it looks like when we do that and
448:07 - then we'll try a different merge option
448:09 - and we'll see how much cleaner it is uh
448:12 - doing that another way so what I want to
448:14 - do is I want to go ahead and modify this
448:17 - file save it and go get commit hyphen M
448:22 - change one and we're going to do ma to
448:26 - grab all of them in one go and then I
448:28 - want to get push okay and then we're
448:31 - going to do this again
448:33 - save and I'm going to just do a
448:36 - semicolon so I can just get through this
448:38 - a lot quicker so we'll do that
448:41 - again we'll do that
448:44 - again okay you're getting kind of the
448:46 - idea what's going on here we're kind of
448:48 - crazy
448:50 - people are not going to be happy with
448:52 - all of our
448:53 - commits okay great so now if we go back
448:55 - to our G
448:57 - graph here we got a bunch of changes I
449:01 - guess we should have incremented them it
449:03 - just says 1111 uh we can demend those
449:06 - like there's a way to rename them I
449:08 - don't really want to deal with that but
449:10 - let's just assume we didn't name it all
449:12 - dumb like that we made 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or
449:14 - for the next one we'll we'll just name
449:16 - it two so the idea is that what will
449:18 - happen the question is what Willen
449:19 - happen when we merge this in will we end
449:20 - up with one over here or all of these
449:23 - over here and that's what we're going to
449:25 - find out so we'll create a pull request
449:28 - we'll make a new pull request we will
449:31 - merge Dev to main we'll create that pull
449:34 - request I'm going to switch it back to
449:36 - normal we'll create that pull request
449:38 - we're going to ignore our reviewers
449:40 - we're going to just review it
449:42 - ourself and notice we're on Create and
449:45 - merge commit so we do this and what do
449:48 - we get we go back over to get graph and
449:51 - I'm going to go get fetch because
449:54 - that'll update the graph without pulling
449:56 - anything and now notice that all of
449:58 - these
450:00 - commits um is up here
450:02 - now okay so that is there it didn't
450:07 - squash them all into one we still have
450:08 - all of the history of them
450:11 - okay so just to make this clear I'm
450:14 - going to just go get checkout main get
450:18 - poll
450:20 - get check out Dev get pull because I
450:23 - want to show you that they're all still
450:25 - there okay oh sorry get merge
450:29 - main get
450:31 - poll and
450:34 - refresh okay and I'll just do a get push
450:37 - for our Dev sorry but what I want to
450:40 - show you is that all of this history is
450:42 - still here it's not gone right it's all
450:45 - still here so hopefully that is clear I
450:47 - know it's not the best visual but I'm
450:48 - hoping that makes sense what I want to
450:50 - do now is I want to do a
450:54 - um I want to do a squash okay for the
450:57 - branch so I'm going to just
451:00 - make a new
451:04 - Branch get checkout Dev
451:08 - 2 and actually I'm going to do get
451:10 - checkout hyphen B Dev 2 and then we'll
451:13 - do get uh because we want to push this
451:15 - Branch get push you origin de Dev two
451:21 - and so now it's being remotely check uh
451:22 - tracked and I want to do something
451:23 - really similar to what we were doing
451:25 - before so I'm going to go here and for
451:26 - each one I'm going to remove a line okay
451:28 - we'll save
451:32 - it I'm looking for that one
451:34 - liner there we go and this will just be
451:36 - two this time two and we'll go here save
451:40 - that this will be two and we'll go ahead
451:42 - and save this and this will be two and
451:46 - we'll go ahead and save this and this
451:48 - will be two and we'll go ahead and save
451:50 - this and this will be
451:51 - two all right let's go back to our G
451:54 - graph we have a bunch of this stuff here
451:57 - let's go over here and make a new pull
451:59 - request this
452:01 - time we're going to Dev
452:04 - 2 and we're going to create that pull
452:06 - request and we're going to say create
452:07 - pull request and this time we're going
452:10 - to say merge pull request squash and
452:13 - merge squash and merge it's bringing all
452:16 - those commits in and now if we go back
452:18 - here and we
452:21 - refresh
452:23 - okay um we're going to refresh here
452:25 - again oh I got to go fetch get fetch
452:28 - that's why we don't see anything here
452:29 - get fetch or
452:32 - refresh and so notice now it doesn't
452:34 - show like a merge line coming into here
452:37 - what it's done it's taken all of this
452:39 - stuff and it's squashed it into a new
452:42 - commit and has it over here okay so it
452:45 - really depends on what you want do you
452:46 - want to keep all this history or do you
452:48 - want to kind of have this like over here
452:51 - and this has a completely separated
452:52 - commit here um it's really up to you how
452:55 - you want to do it I think this looks a
452:56 - lot cleaner um but this is totally an
452:59 - option as well it's really what you want
453:01 - to do and I will see you uh in the next
453:05 - one so before I do that I'm just going
453:06 - to stop my
453:11 - workspace all right and see you later
453:18 - ciao
453:19 - poll request templates are similar to
453:21 - issue templates they will populate the
453:23 - poll request text area with the
453:24 - specified markdown template so there it
453:28 - is um I need to point out that uh it's
453:31 - in
453:32 - GitHub requestor template. MD that's
453:35 - what you want to use technically there
453:38 - is a folder called pull request template
453:39 - that you can use but I found that you
453:42 - really couldn't leverage it because
453:43 - there was no UI to select from it and
453:46 - the only way that you could do that was
453:48 - via this URL you gener with a query
453:49 - string so um I would suggest that you
453:52 - use pull request template MD and not use
453:55 - the folder uh and that's where it kind
453:57 - of feels like it's it's like uh where
454:00 - you have issue templates where they have
454:01 - that older version of it P requests
454:04 - still feel like that old kind of version
454:06 - if that makes sense so there you
454:08 - [Music]
454:12 - go GitHub discussions is a community
454:14 - communication tool for your public or
454:17 - private GitHub repos and there's a lot
454:19 - lot of features it has it has threaded
454:20 - conversations categorization Community
454:23 - interaction markdown support pin
454:25 - discussions conversation polls
454:28 - discussion voting convers uh conversion
454:30 - to issues
454:32 - notifications searchable uh searchable
454:35 - linkable GitHub integration and I'm
454:37 - certainly sure there is more um you have
454:40 - to turn this on as a feature in your
454:42 - repo a discussion tab will appear in
454:44 - your GitHub repo and you'll have some
454:46 - default categories to begin with so
454:48 - there you go
454:49 - [Music]
454:54 - so when someone creates a discussion in
454:56 - GitHub discussions they need to choose a
454:58 - category and there's a bunch that
454:59 - already exists for you by default um but
455:02 - you can create your own and it's a
455:04 - powerful feature to have so the idea is
455:06 - that you have these discussion formats
455:08 - and we have these four so we have open
455:10 - discussion this is just free form
455:11 - conversation you have Q&A where you're
455:13 - basically up voting the best answer
455:15 - think of stack Overflow you have
455:18 - announcements only admins can make these
455:20 - posts anyone can reply you have polls so
455:22 - you can uh pull people to see you know
455:26 - things uh categories can be grouped into
455:28 - sections and it's pretty straightforward
455:29 - from there
455:31 - [Music]
455:34 - okay specifically for the Q&A discussion
455:37 - format you can mark an answer that is
455:39 - the recommended answer regardless of the
455:40 - up boots to help direct which question
455:43 - you think is the most credible this is
455:44 - very similar to stack Overflow so the
455:46 - idea is that as a men or maybe a
455:48 - maintainer
455:49 - I can mark it as the answer and then it
455:51 - will show up as the answer the reason
455:54 - I'm calling this out because it could be
455:55 - an exam question so there you
455:57 - [Music]
456:01 - go we can pin discussions this is
456:04 - similar to issues um and the idea is uh
456:07 - you can just pin a discussion it shows
456:09 - up at the top of the page and it'll be
456:11 - nice and colorful you can pin for
456:13 - particular categories or for the whole
456:15 - discussions page but it's very
456:17 - straightforward okay
456:22 - for a discussion you can actually
456:24 - convert it into an issue I say convert
456:27 - with quotations because really what
456:28 - you're doing is creating a new issue
456:30 - it's weird they use the language convert
456:32 - in the documentation but clearly when
456:34 - you're adding it right there it's
456:35 - telling you it's just creating an issue
456:37 - it's just going to pre-populate it with
456:39 - the same content and then it's going to
456:40 - have a soft link it's not like Po
456:42 - request to issues or there's any
456:44 - relationship there it's just a simple
456:45 - link um and a convenient way to help you
456:48 - make uh an issue from a discussion
456:51 - [Music]
456:54 - okay hey this is Andrew Brown and in
456:56 - this follow along I want to take a look
456:57 - at discussions so we have our fund repo
457:00 - in our uh organization account I'm going
457:02 - to go to settings and let's go ahead and
457:04 - enable discussions so we'll go and do
457:06 - that I'm going to go ahead and set it up
457:08 - based on the default and it has a bunch
457:10 - of cool stuff I'm going to go ahead and
457:11 - hit start discussion and so now if we go
457:14 - over to our discussions we have our
457:16 - first discussion that we've ever posted
457:18 - we have some default categories you can
457:21 - see I can upvote or you know not upvote
457:24 - and then if I want to provide a marked
457:26 - answer I can just hit comment
457:28 - here um oh this one is just uploading it
457:31 - not necessarily has Q&A so let's go
457:34 - ahead and try some of the different
457:35 - discussion formats so I'll say new
457:37 - discussion and we'll say Q&A I'll say uh
457:42 - what
457:43 - is the best movie
457:46 - ever we'll start a discussion
457:49 - what is
457:54 - it and from there I'll just say
457:59 - Roadhouse okay and so people can uh mark
458:02 - it up or I can mark it as the a correct
458:04 - answer and that shows up like that we
458:06 - could turn this into an issue if we
458:08 - wanted to so I could well first I could
458:09 - pin this discussion and put it at the
458:11 - top so that's another thing so now it'll
458:14 - be at the top of our page here okay but
458:17 - the other thing that we can do is create
458:19 - this into an
458:20 - issue and now it's an issue there you go
458:25 - we can go back to our
458:26 - discussions um a few other things that
458:28 - we could do we could make a poll so that
458:30 - might be
458:33 - interesting choose the best
458:37 - movie what is the best
458:41 - movie what is the best movie we'll say
458:44 - Roadhouse or Roadhouse
458:47 - 2 Roadhouse 2 is not a good
458:49 - movie we'll go ahead and start that
458:51 - discussion and now we can vote there we
458:56 - go yeah um if you want to see a little
458:58 - bit more with uh like a full discussion
459:02 - uh GitHub as their own it's
459:05 - called discussion community and so you
459:08 - can see it's a lot more active a lot
459:10 - more fun stuff you can see that I made a
459:13 - post the other day here
459:16 - um about certifications that I was
459:18 - trying to provide provide them feedback
459:20 - they didn't hear me they ignored me but
459:22 - this is all about the certification that
459:24 - you are taking right now as I was trying
459:27 - to describe what I thought was lacking
459:28 - and what could be better um and if
459:31 - you're watching this video and you want
459:33 - to practice using GitHub discussions can
459:36 - you do me a favor and can you upvote
459:39 - this um because I feel like GitHub
459:42 - should really listen and it's a great
459:43 - opportunity for you to test the feature
459:45 - and then we can see how many people have
459:46 - been using this here so you can come
459:49 - over here and leave a comment and give
459:51 - it an up vote um but yeah that's about
459:53 - it for discussions and I'll see you in
459:55 - the next one okay
459:57 - [Music]
460:00 - ciao so I just want to quickly point out
460:03 - that you can find your notification
460:05 - options in your profile under
460:08 - notifications and you have some options
460:10 - there about what you are looking at for
460:12 - subscriptions what you're automatically
460:14 - watching or not watching go take a look
460:17 - there again I didn't see the examp am
460:18 - asking any of the stuff but you should
460:20 - really take a look here and see all the
460:22 - options here and we'll probably do that
460:24 - in one of the U uh the follow alongs
460:27 - here
460:27 - [Music]
460:31 - okay for notifications we have some
460:33 - filter options and uh we actually have a
460:36 - filter syntax it looks the same as every
460:38 - other filter syntax we've been looking
460:40 - at in GitHub so far there are some
460:42 - predefined save filters where you can
460:44 - see that they already have filter
460:45 - syntaxes underneath and if you want you
460:48 - can I think you can create your own yeah
460:49 - you can create your own new filters uh
460:51 - there is the option to group by
460:53 - repository or date again I don't
460:55 - remember the exam ever asking uh this
460:57 - but it's in the exam guide outline so I
460:59 - just wanted to quickly point this out
461:01 - [Music]
461:04 - okay so something you can do is you can
461:07 - mention people in um in comments and so
461:11 - what that will do is that will get their
461:13 - attention um and by that I mean it'll
461:16 - show up in your inbox uh for the f
461:18 - filters you can go to the mention and
461:20 - quickly find where you have been
461:21 - mentioned and yeah that's pretty much it
461:24 - it's just you mention people and it gets
461:26 - their attention and it'll show up in
461:27 - your notifications in box
461:29 - [Music]
461:33 - okay so the notifications inbox provides
461:36 - a chronological list of notification
461:38 - threads this allows you to keep on top
461:40 - of all subscribe activities with an
461:41 - Associated GitHub repo and that's
461:44 - located at/ notifications um and I want
461:47 - to point out that there is some other
461:48 - notification views I don't know if these
461:50 - are Legacy views or alternate views but
461:53 - I figured I should cover our bases and
461:55 - look at all of them most of the stuff
461:58 - that I think the exam is going to focus
461:59 - on is probably the inbox but I never got
462:03 - any questions about notifications
462:05 - whatsoever in my exam attempt but if you
462:07 - do um you know let's just make sure we
462:09 - cover our bases here
462:11 - [Music]
462:14 - okay hey this is angrew brown and in
462:17 - this video I want to want to take a look
462:19 - at the notifications inbox which is in
462:20 - the top right corner it looks like a
462:22 - little inbox you can also get there by
462:24 - probably going to Notifications
462:27 - somewhere I thought it would be here on
462:29 - the leand side or right hand side It
462:31 - Isn't So I guess you really do have to
462:33 - click that inbox to get there that's
462:35 - going to be up here at
462:36 - notifications um this is showing stuff
462:39 - that we're participating in so you'll
462:41 - notice that uh we have um what looks to
462:44 - be poll requests and I guess we can
462:49 - click into there and get to them right
462:50 - away so you can see that um you know
462:53 - somebody's talking to me here and so I'm
462:54 - getting those uh alerts there and this
462:57 - has to do with all participating stuff
462:59 - so there's not a lot to show here um but
463:03 - we can show mentioning because that's
463:05 - something that I think would be
463:06 - interesting to show so what I'm going to
463:08 - do is go over to my other account and
463:11 - I'm going to go into a repo that we're
463:14 - both in so I'm going to go to Andrew WC
463:17 - Brown um
463:19 - um and there should be a repo
463:22 - here no that's that's not it I'm part of
463:25 - some organization called Cloud
463:28 - journeyers already forgot what it's
463:30 - called so I have to get the URL
463:32 - from this one here and we'll switch over
463:35 - to cloud
463:36 - journe and I want the fun repo and I'm
463:39 - just going to grab that link go back to
463:41 - the other
463:43 - account and then from here I'll just go
463:46 - into an issue and I'm just going to
463:49 - say um I think so I'll say andrewc brown
463:53 - I think that would be
463:59 - Roadhouse okay maybe we can go get an
464:01 - image roadh house for fun movie
464:04 - Roadhouse
464:06 - movie there we go oh yeah that's a good
464:11 - that's a good one so I'm just going to
464:13 - drag that off screen here and bring that
464:16 - in here so we got another reason to use
464:18 - uploads for file images and I'll comment
464:21 - that and there we go so now what I'm
464:23 - going to do is go back to that other
464:25 - account and I'm going to go into my
464:27 - inbox and see if I was
464:30 - mentioned what the heck oh there it is
464:34 - okay we just had to be a little bit
464:34 - patient so there it is um we know we
464:37 - have some other options over here we
464:40 - have what's this I guess
464:42 - approve uh don't get any more alerts for
464:45 - it or save it for later or bookmark it
464:47 - um
464:48 - I guess you should know those options
464:50 - again I didn't see them in the exam in
464:53 - terms of other stuff I'm going to go to
464:54 - my other account to kind of show you a
464:56 - little bit more because it has more
464:57 - information in it but uh of course we
465:00 - can filter stuff so I can say is
465:04 - unread and then we can even click
465:06 - through and do more stuff like repo
465:08 - is exam Pro you know and then I can
465:12 - click there and it should filter for
465:13 - that we could Group by repository
465:16 - instead right so that makes a a little
465:18 - bit more clear pretty straightforward
465:21 - pretty straightforward um and that's
465:24 - about it okay
465:27 - [Music]
465:31 - C so you can watch a repo in order to
465:35 - get notified of activities uh your own
465:37 - repos are you're going to be set as
465:40 - watching and so you can change the level
465:42 - of participation that you want if it
465:44 - feels like we're repeating this we did
465:45 - because we covered watching prior we
465:48 - were talking about repos but what we
465:49 - didn't cover was the fact that there's
465:50 - this additional watching page where you
465:52 - can find where everything that you're
465:53 - watching this does not show up on the
465:55 - the notifications inbox so this is a
465:58 - page you're going to want to know in
465:59 - order to keep track of stuff that you're
466:02 - watching so there you
466:04 - [Music]
466:07 - go let's take a look at notification
466:09 - subscriptions and this allows you to
466:11 - follow activities for a specific PLL
466:14 - request or issue so if you go into an
466:16 - issue or you go into a PLL request they
466:18 - have that notifications area where you
466:20 - can say I'm subscribing and you can see
466:22 - all your subscriptions on your
466:23 - notifications page but more or less the
466:26 - notification inbox is going to take care
466:28 - of that um but what I want you to
466:30 - remember is that watching is for repos
466:34 - it's for people it's for organizations
466:37 - notification subscriptions are for very
466:40 - specific poll requests or issues okay so
466:43 - there you
466:46 - go
466:48 - hey this is angre brown and this fall
466:50 - along I want to take a look at those
466:51 - other screens the watches and the
466:53 - subscription so we can uh see that
466:55 - alternate View and the easiest way to
466:57 - get there is to go to the Inbox and I
467:00 - can scroll all the way down to the
467:01 - ground and we have the options down
467:02 - below and so if I click into watch
467:05 - repositories I can see all the repos I'm
467:07 - watching and I can see all the
467:09 - subscriptions I belong to and there's
467:11 - not a whole lot to say here this is kind
467:12 - of like an alternate view of um
467:15 - notifications inbox so it's not that
467:17 - super exciting but it is another
467:19 - simplified view we can go take a look at
467:21 - our notification settings and we didn't
467:23 - really look at this in the lecture slide
467:25 - so I should cover it a bit more here and
467:27 - carefully read it so we have the default
467:29 - notification email so if I want to send
467:31 - that to another email I can do that
467:32 - there's custom routing which allows you
467:34 - to send certain things uh to certain
467:37 - emails I've never played around with it
467:38 - before but it sounds cool we can a
467:41 - automatically watch
467:42 - repositories uh or teams so I imagine if
467:45 - we join a team we're match we're
467:47 - watching it if if we uh create a repo or
467:49 - own it we're watching it we can choose
467:51 - between email and GitHub okay um
467:55 - notification for conversations you're
467:57 - participating uh in so whether we get a
468:00 - mention if if we should get alerted uh
468:03 - apparently we can customize our email
468:06 - updates so basically what we're going to
468:07 - get in those
468:09 - emails then we can get a weekly digest
468:12 - or not get any emails whatsoever you can
468:14 - get notified about dependabot alerts um
468:17 - notified about GitHub actions and then a
468:20 - deploy key alert so when you're giving
468:22 - admin permissions and org when a new
468:25 - deploy key is add it so there is your
468:27 - settings and that wraps up
468:31 - [Music]
468:34 - notifications so gists provide a simple
468:37 - way to share code Snippets with others
468:38 - and every gist is a get repo which means
468:41 - that it can be forked and cloned you can
468:43 - get this at just. github.com this is a
468:46 - super useful service I use it all the
468:47 - time time and uh here's an example of a
468:50 - public gist gist can be public or secret
468:53 - public gists are searchable public gists
468:55 - show up in uh in Discovery or discover I
468:58 - should say secret gist are not
469:00 - searchable and do not show up in
469:02 - Discovery secret gists are not private
469:05 - they are secret but they're not private
469:07 - you can share yours with friends and
469:09 - because that URL could be given to
469:10 - somebody else they could get access to
469:13 - it secret gist can be changed to uh be
469:16 - Public public gist can not be changed to
469:18 - be private you can pin just to your
469:21 - profile for other others to easily find
469:24 - just allow other users to comment just
469:27 - allow you to navigate revisions with
469:29 - ease you need to remember these factoids
469:33 - because the exams will test you on it I
469:36 - got just questions and one was about
469:38 - like um about knowing how to fork or
469:42 - clone uh and also for the uh the private
469:46 - thing that just secrets are not actually
469:49 - private to create a gist very
469:50 - straightforward uh oh sorry I just want
469:52 - to point out that gists can be also
469:55 - marked down as well they don't
469:57 - necessarily have to be code and that's
469:59 - really nice but to create a gist is very
470:01 - straightforward you name it you provide
470:03 - the file name so knows how to do the
470:04 - syntax highlighting you provide your
470:06 - code you can attach a few files to it
470:09 - and create a gist I'm going to remind
470:12 - you that and maybe I didn't write it in
470:14 - there but gists are full repos okay so
470:18 - even though they're like single files
470:19 - they're full git repost uh and you can
470:22 - clone them and do a lot of fun stuff
470:24 - with them
470:25 - [Music]
470:28 - okay I was saying that you can fork and
470:30 - clone gists uh and the way you would do
470:33 - that is if you drop down the embed
470:34 - you'll see clone options I don't know
470:36 - why they kind of hide it on you but
470:38 - basically you just clone it like a
470:39 - regular repo um and for uh just repos
470:43 - other than yours you can just Fork them
470:45 - so those are two things you need to know
470:46 - because they'll probably show up in the
470:48 - exam and I just want to make sure I
470:49 - really call those out to you here
470:52 - [Music]
470:55 - okay hey this is Andrew Brown and in
470:57 - this follow along I want to take a look
470:59 - at gists so gists allow you to create
471:02 - simp it's a code that you can share with
471:03 - other folks so I'm going to go ahead and
471:05 - do just. github.com and I'm just going
471:07 - to zoom on out here and before we create
471:09 - anything I just want to show you that
471:10 - there isn't all gist page so we can see
471:13 - a bunch of stuff that's already here and
471:15 - maybe we can go take a test and just
471:17 - clone something at random so or not
471:19 - clone but Fork so if we go uh here we
471:22 - can just Fork this and now we can make
471:25 - changes uh to this here and so I'm going
471:27 - to go hit hit edit and I'm going just
471:29 - make some changes and hit update to this
471:32 - and what's cool is that you have this
471:34 - revisions Tab and it actually shows you
471:36 - what's been changed over time so that's
471:38 - something that I really like is that if
471:39 - you're trying to uh teach somebody
471:41 - something and you need to show that
471:42 - history over time just make for great
471:46 - examples um so I really like that again
471:49 - embed here you can go ahead and clone
471:51 - htps or SSH let's go over here and make
471:55 - a new gist I want to make a private one
471:57 - so I'm going to keep it or sorry not
471:59 - private but secret so I'm going to go
472:01 - ahead and say secret
472:04 - gist okay and we'll try to make this
472:07 - markdown so just say readme.md
472:10 - I'll say secret
472:13 - gist this is
472:16 - Secret okay and maybe what we'll do is
472:20 - we'll attach our file here I wonder if
472:21 - we can just drag it in yes we
472:23 - can
472:25 - and me I think it
472:28 - added
472:31 - okay oh maybe it's it's in there I'm not
472:34 - I'm not 100% sure but I dragged it in
472:37 - and we'll go ahead and create this
472:38 - secret
472:40 - gist contents can't be empty that's
472:42 - totally fine um I'm not exactly
472:45 - sure okay so you do that
472:47 - [Music]
472:49 - um I thought like you
472:51 - would drag it in maybe it's very
472:55 - particular in terms of what you can
472:56 - bring in again the exam's not going to
472:58 - test you on that but I'm a bit confused
472:59 - why I can't bring that image in but I'm
473:01 - going to go ahead and create this gist
473:03 - and it is secret if I want to share this
473:04 - with
473:05 - somebody um I would give them the
473:07 - sharable link so there it is new tab
473:11 - there we go right pretty straightforward
473:14 - uh you can pin these to your profiles I
473:16 - think we did that already
473:18 - um so if I go over to our and you can
473:21 - star just as well right so if you go
473:23 - here you can star just you go your star
473:26 - gists right but um if we go back to
473:30 - github.com I think we already have one
473:33 - pinned from before so if we go to our
473:36 - repositories or sorry not repositories
473:39 - our profile we can see we pinned one
473:42 - earlier so yeah there you go that's
473:46 - just
473:49 - [Music]
473:51 - a Wiki is a collaborative way to quickly
473:53 - create documentation and multiple nested
473:56 - pages and a Wiki would serve as a
473:58 - knowledge base for your repler or your
473:59 - organization wikis are not unique to
474:02 - GitHub but it's just a functionality
474:03 - that they have uh and so the idea is
474:05 - that you'd have this uh thing that looks
474:07 - like markdown could actually be
474:08 - something else in markdown and you can
474:10 - search it and navigate through pages um
474:13 - to turn on Wiki for a repo you have to
474:17 - check box on Wiki you go to the wiki tab
474:19 - you create your pages GitHub wikis can
474:22 - be used for free on public repos which
474:23 - is how we're going to be able to use
474:25 - them I said that uh it can be other
474:28 - types of markdown or sorry markup and
474:30 - markdown is the default but there's a
474:32 - bunch here because wikis have existed
474:34 - for a long time and so they've uh really
474:36 - had a lot of different kinds of uh
474:38 - templating languages to link other Pages
474:41 - you provide the GitHub Wiki Pages the
474:43 - title as the link um so that's a little
474:46 - bit different for link
474:47 - and that's one thing you need to know
474:49 - for visibility if you create a Wiki in a
474:51 - public repo the wiki is available to the
474:53 - public if you create a Wiki in a private
474:54 - repo only people with access to the repo
474:57 - can access the wiki so there you
475:00 - [Music]
475:03 - go hey this is Angie Brown and this
475:05 - follow along we're going to take a look
475:07 - at wikis and so I figured what we can do
475:10 - is go to our um organization and we'll
475:13 - go over into our fun repo and we'll turn
475:17 - that feature on by going to settings and
475:20 - Wiki apparently is already turned on I
475:22 - don't remember turning it on but hey
475:23 - it's on maybe it's on by default and
475:25 - we'll go ahead and create our first new
475:26 - page and this is our homepage so it's as
475:29 - simple as creating it and we want to
475:32 - create another page this one is going to
475:34 - be called about and I want to link this
475:37 - one to our homepage and so it'll be as
475:40 - simple as putting Square braces
475:43 - parentheses and we'll say homepage and I
475:45 - think the other one is called home page
475:47 - so as long as that is
475:50 - correct that should work um it doesn't
475:53 - look like it linked so maybe it's just
475:55 - called homes I'll try that again and
475:58 - we'll edit this
476:00 - page and we'll save it there we go and
476:04 - that links back there and so we can see
476:05 - they're both there there's some way to
476:07 - provide structure underneath I'm not
476:09 - sure if that just uses headings so I'm
476:11 - going to go ahead and try this and just
476:12 - say heading one heading
476:16 - two
476:18 - and you know wikis here are not that
476:21 - great um like I remember wikis all the
476:25 - way back in 2005 and yeah they it's
476:28 - providing that structure and you know
476:30 - they would allow you to basically just
476:31 - start writing links and when you click
476:33 - through they create them so definitely
476:35 - not a New Concept um this one's not that
476:37 - great but it is here and it is free so
476:41 - you can decide whether you want to use
476:42 - it most providers will have some kind of
476:44 - knowledge based thing and that is
476:46 - github's kind of offer
476:47 - but again I don't think a lot of
476:49 - companies like to use this and I've seen
476:51 - a lot of organizations start on here and
476:53 - then abandon it and just take it off of
476:55 - GitHub but uh it is a thing and they
476:57 - want us to cover it so there you
476:59 - [Music]
477:03 - go GitHub Pages allows you to directly
477:05 - host a static website via a GitHub repo
477:09 - you need to create your public repo with
477:11 - the repo name so uh this would be Omen
477:15 - king. github.io it has to github.io for
477:18 - this to work you simply add your HTML
477:20 - files however you could use jaal which
477:22 - is a static site generator that allows
477:24 - you to build more complex static sites
477:26 - and it it uses yaml files with front
477:28 - matter and markdown files and it
477:30 - directly integrates with GitHub Pages
477:32 - because it is a GitHub project um and
477:35 - your website will be available at the
477:36 - domain name with your username at GitHub
477:39 - do I wrote com it's supposed to
477:42 - beio so cross that out IO there you
477:48 - [Music]
477:51 - go hey this is Andrew Brown and this
477:53 - follow along I want to go ahead and
477:55 - create ourselves a static website so
477:58 - apparently what we can do is use our
478:00 - username and do
478:04 - github.io and that should allow us to
478:07 - turn this into a static website so what
478:09 - I'm going to do is go ahead initialize a
478:11 - read me and we'll make this a repo
478:14 - public and we'll see if it's as simple
478:16 - as they say it is I'm going to go ahead
478:18 - and add a new file here this one is
478:21 - going to be an index HTML file so we'll
478:23 - just go ahead and say index
478:25 - HTML and I need a little bit of code
478:27 - here so I'm just going to get a template
478:29 - for an in index HTML
478:34 - page maybe we get one from free Camp I'm
478:36 - going to go ahead and grab this one here
478:39 - I don't need any JavaScript so I'm just
478:41 - going to take that out there we'll give
478:43 - that a preview looks fine to me we'll go
478:46 - ahead and commit those changes commit
478:48 - those changes and so the question is is
478:50 - this a static website um I don't know
478:53 - let's go ahead and copy this maybe we
478:54 - have to turn it
478:55 - on nope but we can go try to figure it
478:59 - out by going over to here and so I'm
479:01 - carefully looking for that static
479:03 - website hosting I've done it before it's
479:05 - just been a
479:06 - while
479:09 - and yeah uh it's pages over here Pages
479:13 - ah here we go so build and deployment so
479:16 - deploy from a
479:17 - branch that's the classic experience I'm
479:20 - totally fine with
479:21 - that
479:23 - and I'll choose
479:29 - main
479:31 - okay what happened it used to just let
479:33 - you do static Pages let's go take a look
479:35 - here uhuh create the do that's what I
479:38 - did I followed the instructions on this
479:41 - page and if the repository doesn't match
479:44 - the name exactly it won't it won't work
479:46 - okay
479:48 - Okay
479:49 - uhhuh add an index page okay sure push
479:54 - and you're done well I did all
479:58 - that so I'm going to try this
480:01 - again oh okay it just needed some time
480:03 - to propagate but here looks like we can
480:06 - do a little bit more so if we were to
480:08 - integrate um jaal and deploy it and like
480:11 - integrate it we could deploy that Jackal
480:13 - is pretty cool um it's a little bit out
480:15 - of scope for this sort of
480:17 - the other thing that's interesting is
480:18 - you could add a custom
480:20 - domain GitHub doesn't seem to really
480:22 - care about GitHub Pages for the exam so
480:25 - um you know it's on here but I I didn't
480:27 - see any questions so this is why it's so
480:29 - so light that we're covering here but uh
480:31 - that's it
480:32 - [Music]
480:36 - okay let's take a look at GitHub actions
480:39 - which is a cicd pipeline directly
480:40 - integrated with GitHub repos and GitHub
480:43 - actions allows you to automate running
480:45 - test Suites building uh IM
480:47 - specifically Docker images compiling
480:49 - static sites deploying code to servers
480:51 - and more and we can access this all
480:54 - through the actions tab in your GitHub
480:56 - repo uh when you first use GitHub
480:59 - actions there are some templates that
481:01 - you can utilize and all these files are
481:03 - stored in your workflow directory in
481:05 - your GitHub folder as you can see
481:07 - there's this kind of yaml file that
481:09 - we're going to utilize it's going to be
481:11 - important that we remember some of the
481:12 - structure so I remember on the exam they
481:14 - wanted you to know that there was jobs
481:16 - on and steps uh you can have multiple
481:20 - workflows in a repo triggered by
481:21 - different events so when you run GitHub
481:24 - actions you'll get a history of workflow
481:26 - runs where it will indicate if it was
481:28 - successful or a failure how long it took
481:30 - to run so this is um for something
481:32 - probably for um some for one of the boot
481:34 - camps that we ran as we used GitHub
481:36 - actions to build the site if you want to
481:39 - find the example repos because there are
481:41 - those little getting started but it's
481:42 - the same repo here at the starter
481:45 - workflows and you can get the yaml files
481:47 - and get started really quickly there are
481:49 - different types of triggers uh that you
481:52 - can use with GitHub actions that's going
481:54 - to go on that on area and GitHub there's
481:57 - about 35 GitHub actions I say plus
482:00 - because in case there are more that I'm
482:01 - not aware of I'm covering my bases there
482:04 - examples of common GitHub actions could
482:06 - be pushes pull requests issues releases
482:11 - schedule events and manual triggers the
482:13 - exam wants you to know that you can
482:14 - trigger based on these things so make
482:16 - sure you remember this short little list
482:19 - here
482:20 - [Music]
482:23 - okay hey this is angrew brown and this
482:26 - follow let's take a look at GitHub
482:28 - actions so what I want to do is go over
482:30 - to our organization I'm going to go to
482:33 - our fund repo and here we have a tab
482:35 - called actions where we can set up some
482:37 - GitHub actions now I don't use GitHub
482:39 - actions a whole lot maybe I will if I go
482:42 - ahead and do that GitHub action cert uh
482:44 - certification course but uh we'll just
482:46 - have to kind of work our way through it
482:48 - it shouldn't be too hard so there's a
482:50 - lot of different things that we can
482:51 - utilize here I can set up terraform
482:53 - which is kind of cool uh we have
482:55 - deployment to AWS to Azure to Alibaba
482:58 - Cloud we have some security things that
483:00 - we can do here we have continuous
483:02 - integration automation a whole host of
483:05 - stuff and um you can even do static
483:09 - compilation which is pretty cool as well
483:11 - so we're going to have to make make a
483:13 - decision in terms of something that we
483:14 - want to use um um I don't think it's
483:18 - going to be deployment because that
483:19 - seems like a lot of work um so I'm
483:23 - trying to make a decision
483:26 - here what we could
483:29 - utilize build lint and test a rails
483:32 - application that seems pretty small or
483:34 - easy for me to do but maybe we should
483:36 - try to use one of these things down
483:38 - below um labels pull requests based on
483:41 - files change let's go ahead and see if
483:43 - we can utilize that so I hit the
483:45 - configure button and it's going to bring
483:46 - us into this action and I guess there's
483:49 - the marketplace where we can get uh more
483:51 - stuff I didn't even realize there was a
483:53 - Marketplace for this looks like we got
483:55 - some documentation here so customizing
483:57 - when workflow is run based on trigger so
483:59 - here it says on push Branch so when we
484:02 - push to specific ones we can trigger
484:04 - different
484:05 - stuff okay so that's kind of cool let's
484:08 - take a look here and see if we can
484:09 - expand this and see what we're looking
484:11 - at so we have name labeler on pull
484:14 - request Target jobs and then we have
484:18 - labels so run as Ubuntu so probably
484:21 - start a container as an Ubuntu with
484:24 - permissions of contents to read and it
484:26 - can write pull requests and the step
484:28 - that we're going to have here it's going
484:29 - to use the actions labeler version 4 and
484:32 - with the repo token it's going to bring
484:33 - in that token so it has authorization to
484:35 - do so and we know about GitHub tokens um
484:38 - and I think I think we showed this uh
484:41 - for GitHub actions but not 100% sure so
484:46 - care reading here the whole point of
484:47 - this is to apply labelers and the
484:49 - basically the way it's going to do that
484:50 - is through these steps and so I'm
484:52 - assuming that this is kind of like a
484:53 - built-in step and if we go here and just
484:55 - type it in maybe we'll go find
484:58 - it yeah and so they're talking about
485:00 - actions
485:01 - here hold on
485:03 - here I guess it's just a repo so I'm get
485:08 - documentation
485:11 - and oh okay it's called actions all
485:14 - right and so this whole repo
485:17 - contains
485:19 - actions all right and so it's coming
485:21 - from this one and so I'm just going to
485:23 - go into here and take a look at what
485:25 - this looks like so just zoom out for a
485:28 - second and it kind of explains maybe how
485:30 - it
485:32 - works um automatically labels new pull
485:35 - requests based on the paths of the files
485:36 - being changed on the branch the ability
485:38 - to apply labels based on names of
485:41 - branches and things like that the bug
485:43 - related to the issue so create a GitHub
485:46 - la. yaml file this will list a uh a list
485:50 - of labels and config options to match
485:52 - and apply the label all right the match
485:56 - object allows control over the matching
485:59 - options you can specify the label to be
486:01 - applied based on the files that have
486:03 - been changed and Etc like
486:07 - that and sounds a little bit
486:11 - complicated but at least down here it's
486:13 - like showing us uh the flow it's
486:14 - interesting that this one is showing
486:16 - version four when clearly there is a
486:18 - version five um there might have been
486:21 - warning up here saying that we should
486:23 - use it doesn't say that we have to use
486:26 - version five or
486:27 - four or we're first to use
486:30 - five um but let's see if we can figure
486:33 - this out so I'm going to go ahead and go
486:37 - down below and just look at the workflow
486:40 - a little bit more here and it looks
486:41 - pretty much the same the only difference
486:43 - is that this one's using version five
486:45 - it's not passing the width for the repo
486:48 - token so I'm not 100% sure if we
486:50 - actually really need to do that but I'm
486:51 - going to go ahead and go commit changes
486:53 - and we'll commit that there okay so now
486:56 - we have that here if we go to
486:59 - actions um we can see that we have
487:02 - labeler and it's only going to run
487:04 - what's going to trigger it let's go take
487:08 - a look
487:09 - here um if we want to know how it
487:11 - triggers we should just take a look at
487:12 - the code and
487:14 - whoops go back here and and take a quick
487:17 - look so it says pull pull request
487:20 - Target so we pull request Target what
487:23 - does that
487:25 - mean we'll go search it
487:29 - here um pull request Target so activity
487:34 - types assigned assigned
487:36 - labeled runs your workflow when activity
487:38 - on a poll request in the workflows
487:41 - repository
487:43 - occurs when activity on a pull request
487:45 - in the workflow activity Cur so it's
487:47 - going to check on based on a lot of
487:50 - stuff so that's pretty broad but that
487:52 - seems fine looks like we could even
487:53 - narrow it down to very specific types
487:56 - okay so I mean that's is how we could
487:58 - play with
487:59 - triggers um and so basically when that
488:02 - triggers it's going to go ahead and then
488:04 - start up Ubuntu for some reason maybe
488:07 - that's what it has to use to run this
488:08 - code that we saw from over
488:11 - here okay and this looks like it's
488:13 - JavaScript or something
488:16 - and then we need that labelers
488:18 - file so we need to make sense of what
488:21 - this is so the base match object is
488:23 - defined as this any glob to any
488:26 - file okay the key okay so what does this
488:30 - thing do automatically label new pull
488:33 - request based
488:34 - on the path of the files being changed
488:38 - on uh changed or the branch
488:43 - name okay well I'd rather just
488:46 - do that on the branch name so let's see
488:48 - if we can find that so it
488:52 - says change
488:56 - files give me a moment just to try to
488:58 - make sense of this and then I'll just
489:00 - save you the trouble of me struggling
489:01 - through it okay okay scrolling on down
489:04 - we're getting better examples this is
489:05 - starting to make more sense it says add
489:07 - an any change label to any changes
489:10 - within the entire
489:12 - repository Okay add documentation label
489:15 - to any changes within the docs folder so
489:18 - maybe what we can do is give this one a
489:20 - go and uh we need to create a file
489:24 - what's this file need to be called.
489:26 - GitHub labeler yaml so we'll go here and
489:28 - I'm going to add a new
489:30 - file
489:32 - okay um add a
489:34 - file this will be
489:37 - label l. yaml double check make sure
489:41 - that is
489:43 - correct I've been known to make mistakes
489:46 - often and I'm going to paste that on in
489:49 - here and we're going to commit that
489:50 - change so now we have our labeler yaml
489:53 - I'm going to go take a look here and see
489:54 - if the action got triggered it did um it
489:58 - failed I mean there's nothing for it to
490:00 - check right now so no event triggers
490:02 - defined is
490:04 - on so not exactly sure what it's saying
490:07 - there but that's totally fine for now
490:09 - and what I need to do is I need to
490:11 - create a poll request I mean it
490:13 - shouldn't trigger unless we have a poll
490:14 - request right
490:16 - um but it did just happen now so I'm
490:18 - curious what would happen if I went
490:20 - ahead and just uh made any kind of
490:24 - change because it shouldn't really
490:25 - trigger unless it's a pull request we'll
490:28 - go here and go back to actions and it
490:31 - ran again so I'm really confused why is
490:33 - this running what it should only happen
490:35 - on a pull request
490:38 - Target um we'll open it up again here
490:42 - so no event trigger defined is
490:47 - on okay maybe there's something wrong
490:50 - with our our workflow
490:53 - file let's see what they say you can
490:56 - trigger all branches just by
490:59 - using remove the hyphen your workflow
491:01 - file seems fine have you checked all
491:04 - indentation so I mean we didn't make
491:06 - that file right it was generated for us
491:09 - let's go take a look and see what we can
491:12 - do about
491:13 - that we have label and labeler
491:17 - okay so this was the one that we
491:20 - wrote I mean everything looks fine here
491:23 - I'm G to open this up in codes spaces or
491:26 - not codes spaces we'll open this up in
491:45 - bring this down on this line like this
491:47 - and do
491:48 - that
491:50 - um I don't know if we need this so I'm
491:54 - just going to take that out because the
491:55 - other one didn't have
491:56 - it okay can expand this yeah it still
491:59 - has this
492:01 - here
492:04 - and I'm not sure why this little red
492:06 - line is here maybe it's just superficial
492:08 - it's confused but this seems fine I'm
492:11 - going to go ahead and update this and
492:13 - say update action
492:17 - the other question is do I have this in
492:19 - the right
492:20 - folder
492:22 - because yeah it's an actions but labeler
492:25 - yaml labeler yaml isn't supposed to be
492:28 - in the actions folder so I think what's
492:30 - happening here is that it thinks I think
492:33 - I know what happened here um if we go
492:34 - back to our
492:36 - repo I think it thinks labeler is a an
492:39 - action yeah so I think it's just we put
492:41 - that in the wrong folder so I'm going to
492:43 - go back and open up
493:03 - github.com it and we will let that
493:07 - push and I'm going to go back over to
493:11 - here all right and if we go back over to
493:14 - actions
493:16 - oh uh this is not the repo we'll go back
493:19 - over to our organization into Fun repo
493:21 - it might have triggered one more time I
493:23 - don't
493:24 - know it has not so we are in good shape
493:28 - can we delete this run yep we can let's
493:30 - just delete this up to clean up so we
493:31 - can see what we're
493:35 - doing and uh what I want to
493:38 - do is I want to trigger that uh pull
493:42 - request to get automatically labeled so
493:43 - we're going to need a label called
493:46 - documentation for this to work so we're
493:48 - going to go here to labels and we'll
493:50 - make a new label there actually already
493:51 - is one called documentation I don't know
493:53 - this is case sensitive so I'm just going
493:54 - to change it to Capital D so it just
493:57 - works for us and we're going to go over
494:00 - here to code and I need a new Branch so
494:03 - I'm going to go to
494:04 - Dev and in here I'm going to create
494:07 - myself
494:09 - a um a docs directory so I'm going to
494:12 - make a new folder
494:14 - here
494:16 - and what I'll do is I'll make
494:20 - a new
494:22 - folder we'll call this
494:24 - docs and I'll say readme.md
494:31 - read me okay we'll save that we'll go
494:34 - ahead and Commit
494:37 - This and we're in a branch right yeah
494:39 - we're in a branch
494:40 - so commit we're like new docs Direct
494:47 - and I know I spelled that wrong it's
494:49 - okay nobody's watching here today
494:51 - there's no grading going on if I ever
494:54 - grade you I'll poke you for that but
494:56 - right now it doesn't matter and I think
494:59 - that we made that in the dev Branch so
495:02 - we'll go over here and I want to go
495:04 - ahead and create a new poll request so
495:06 - want to make sure that folder is there
495:08 - PLL requests new pull request we'll drop
495:12 - down Dev we'll compare that over we'll
495:15 - say create pull
495:16 - request and the idea is that when we
495:18 - create this it should label it if this
495:21 - worked as
495:22 - expected um and so what I want to do is
495:24 - go over to actions and see if it
495:25 - triggered and it's running so it's
495:27 - queued it's going to think what to do it
495:30 - has to spin up compute so this is an
495:34 - instantaneous in progress good we're
495:37 - watching
495:40 - it label complete success we'll go to
495:43 - our pull request there we go look at
495:47 - that um and now we have a p a check that
495:51 - passed and we overgo to our checks and
495:53 - it shows that it passes so you know
495:56 - before we talked about like Branch rules
495:58 - we could maybe just tell it that it has
496:00 - to pass that before it could proceed not
496:03 - a really good example for this but we
496:04 - could try it and it's just an
496:07 - opportunity to show off this Branch
496:08 - protection rule stuff so I'm just
496:10 - looking here carefully for where that
496:12 - was uh it was like checks
496:18 - okay and I'm going to drop that
496:21 - down
496:22 - and still doesn't show up here so maybe
496:25 - that doesn't work as expected but I was
496:27 - hoping that maybe I could just choose
496:28 - that from
496:29 - there um because it's not like an
496:31 - upfront check it's like something that
496:32 - happens after you do that but anyway
496:35 - that's get up actions in a nutshell um
496:37 - it is very important that we understand
496:39 - how those files work so before I go I
496:41 - just want to uh pull up a link because
496:44 - there was something that really explain
496:45 - explained the structure of these files
496:47 - really well it was understanding GitHub
496:49 - actions okay so it's this here learn
496:51 - GitHub actions understanding GitHub
496:53 - actions I think it was this one yeah and
496:55 - so this one really helps explain this
496:57 - workflow file so let's go through it
496:59 - really quickly and make sure we
497:01 - understand it
497:04 - so um first thing is the name so we're
497:06 - going to name it that's optional we have
497:08 - run name so the workflow uh runs the
497:11 - generated from the workflow I guess it's
497:14 - going to be like the Run name we have on
497:16 - so specify the trigger of this workflow
497:19 - so on triggers events jobs groups
497:22 - together all the jobs that
497:24 - run then we have steps groups together
497:27 - all the steps that run uh in the check
497:29 - bats version notice we didn't have these
497:32 - before runs on configures the run on the
497:34 - latest version of Ubuntu Linux Runner I
497:37 - imagine you could change this to other
497:38 - things uses uses keyword specifies the
497:41 - step that will run uh
497:43 - here and of course we found out those
497:46 - are remote repos so that makes sense um
497:50 - and that's pretty much it so so steps
497:52 - jobs on remember those three on jobs and
497:56 - steps
497:57 - okay and that's pretty much it so I'll
498:00 - see you in the next one okay
498:02 - [Music]
498:05 - ciao GitHub co-pilot is an AI developer
498:08 - tool that can be used with multiple
498:10 - idees via an extension so here is an
498:12 - example of it autocom completing code
498:14 - for a terminal base uh blackjack game
498:17 - which I asked it to do it can do code
498:19 - completion you can have uh chat
498:21 - conversations in your ID or mobile while
498:23 - you're working on code it is a CLI
498:26 - assistance it does code referencing
498:28 - public code filter and IP Indemnity I
498:32 - don't know what the last one is but it
498:34 - does it and you can get a free trial
498:36 - with um uh for a one day 30-day trial do
498:40 - you need a credit card I'm not 100% sure
498:41 - but we're going to find out here shortly
498:43 - as we will go and to set it up it is
498:46 - free to use for verified students
498:48 - teachers and maintainers of popular open
498:50 - source
498:52 - [Music]
498:55 - projects all right so let's compare the
498:58 - two versions of uh GitHub co-pilot we
499:00 - have the individuals and the business
499:03 - version of co-pilot and the reason I'm
499:05 - doing this is because I'm pretty sure I
499:07 - got an exam question about a specific
499:09 - comparison so pay close attention so for
499:11 - pricing co-pilot for individuals is $10
499:14 - a month or1 for the year for co-pilot
499:16 - business it's 19 uh USD dollars per user
499:20 - per month the types of GitHub accounts
499:22 - would be personal accounts for
499:24 - individuals and then or and Enterprise
499:26 - accounts for co-pilot business for
499:28 - Telemetry you get it for um individuals
499:32 - which I believe that was the exam
499:33 - question that I got asked for business
499:35 - you do not get it um for Block
499:37 - suggestions matching public code they
499:39 - both get it uh they get both plug uh
499:42 - plug rights into your editor so
499:44 - extensions for both Ides or for both of
499:46 - them for multi-line function suggestions
499:48 - they both get them for organization wide
499:51 - policy management co-pilot business gets
499:53 - that uh excluding specific files
499:55 - co-pilot business gets that for audit
499:58 - logs co-pilot business gets that and
500:01 - then for HTTP proxy support via custom
500:03 - certificates co-pilot business gets that
500:06 - so make sure you know which you can get
500:08 - and which one cannot get those feature
500:10 - sets
500:13 - okay
500:14 - [Music]
500:16 - let's take a quick look on how we would
500:17 - set up co-pilot and some of its
500:19 - functionality so the first thing we will
500:21 - need to do is install the GitHub copile
500:24 - extension in vs code there are
500:26 - extensions for other different browsers
500:28 - but this is the one that we're going to
500:29 - focus on once you install it you want to
500:31 - trust the workspace and install um sign
500:34 - into GitHub for GitHub co-pilot you're
500:37 - going to authorize GitHub in order to
500:39 - allow access and then you'll have this
500:41 - little co-pilot icon in the bottom right
500:44 - corner when you want to start using it
500:46 - the first thing I would do is go look at
500:47 - the keyboard shortcuts they do list
500:50 - keyboard shortcuts on their website but
500:52 - I found that um uh the ones that were
500:54 - set for me were completely different I
500:55 - have no idea why so whether you're on
500:57 - Mac or Windows make sure that you know
500:59 - what your settings are at the time I was
501:01 - doing this I was doing this on my Mac
501:03 - and so it's showing Mac like key
501:06 - bindings here uh it's and again it's
501:08 - just a reminder best to check the hot
501:09 - keys because it can be changed to
501:11 - anything and they didn't seem to match
501:12 - for me um once you have copilot
501:16 - installed you can also enable co-pilot
501:18 - chat feature and this allows you to chat
501:20 - in the le- hand side I found this to be
501:22 - extremely useful and I would recommend
501:25 - turning it on if you can but uh yeah
501:27 - there you
501:31 - go so in this fall along we're going to
501:33 - take a look at installing or setting up
501:36 - and using um GitHub copilot um I have a
501:40 - business version in my uh primary
501:42 - account and this one I'm going to try to
501:44 - set up IND ual um so hopefully that will
501:46 - go smoothly here um so the first thing
501:49 - we want to do is start using co-pilot
501:52 - and maybe a good idea would be to try to
501:54 - use it in um code spaces because I feel
501:58 - like that's going to be a lot easier and
502:00 - there' be direct integration before we
502:01 - do that I just want to show you
502:03 - something kind of funny about uh GitHub
502:06 - and their branding so they have really
502:08 - decided to call themselves an AI powered
502:11 - developer platform which to me is a
502:12 - little bit silly because they're only AI
502:14 - solution is co-pilot is there any other
502:17 - ey stuff not that I'm aware of um but
502:20 - it's a really weird rebranding because
502:21 - they are still a g hosting repository
502:24 - but hey they can do what they want to do
502:27 - but I'm just not going to buy it but
502:28 - anyway let's go ahead and open up code
502:31 - spaces and we do have some other ones
502:33 - down here below just going to delete
502:34 - them and we'll just start from scratch
502:36 - here um just delete and
502:39 - delete so we don't have to worry about
502:42 - these other ones here and what I'm going
502:44 - to do is go over to uh that repo one
502:48 - more time uh over here and we'll go
502:51 - ahead and create ourselves a new code
502:53 - space so we'll just give it a moment to
502:55 - spin up and we'll configure it as per
502:57 - usual all right so our environment or
502:59 - our code space is now running what I'm
503:01 - going to do is go ahead and change the
503:03 - color theme to dark or something that is
503:05 - easier on my eyes and what I'm looking
503:07 - for here is copilot now is it already
503:09 - pre-installed I have no idea we'll go
503:12 - ahead and take a look so we'll type in
503:14 - GitHub co-pilot and see if we can find
503:16 - it here and there it is so there's a
503:19 - couple things I'm going to want I'm
503:21 - going to want GitHub co-pilot and then
503:24 - we have GitHub co-pilot chat it looks
503:26 - like it grabbed both of them when I did
503:28 - that so I didn't have to do anything
503:30 - extra um so that is going to go ahead
503:34 - and install there and then down below it
503:36 - says extension failed no access to
503:37 - GitHub co-pilot you're currently logged
503:40 - in as Andrew Brown that's true and it
503:43 - says no access sign up so let's go sign
503:45 - up for GitHub co-pilot and here we have
503:48 - a few options we have the monthly $10
503:51 - plan or the $100 plan where's my trial
503:55 - so it says pay frequency after trial so
503:57 - you have to pay for it
504:01 - um confirm your payment details and it
504:03 - looks like we'd actually have to fill in
504:05 - payment information so I'm going to save
504:07 - you money here today so that you don't
504:09 - have to spend anything and I'm just
504:10 - going to show you in my other account
504:12 - what it looks like to use uh GitHub cop
504:14 - pilot so you can pass the exam whether
504:16 - you want to fill the stuff in is up to
504:18 - you um I'm not going to do that I'm
504:20 - already paying for it so I'm not going
504:22 - to pay for it twice and uh you know
504:24 - again my expectation is you don't
504:25 - shouldn't have to pay pay for that
504:27 - either so what I'm going to do is go up
504:28 - to my C command pallet and just go into
504:31 - stop and I want to stop the current code
504:34 - space and I mean we figured that out
504:37 - that that's where we're going to hit
504:39 - that boundary I'm going to switch over
504:41 - to Omen
504:43 - King and I'm in the same repo and I
504:45 - think I'm part of this so I can open
504:46 - this up in code spaces and we'll go
504:48 - ahead and do the same process and I'll
504:50 - be back here in just a moment when this
504:52 - environment is ready to go all right so
504:54 - our environment is up and as per usual
504:56 - let's change our theme to something that
504:58 - is a little bit easier on the eyes so
505:00 - there we go and we'll proceed and do the
505:04 - same thing as we were doing before so
505:05 - I'm going to type in
505:06 - co-pilot and that's going to give us
505:08 - co-pilot right here I want the chat to
505:10 - be installed as well but it seems like
505:12 - it knows to pick that up there's also uh
505:14 - copilot co-pilot voice I've never used
505:17 - it it looks like it's in preview so
505:19 - that's kind of interesting but uh not
505:21 - something here for today that we'll be
505:22 - playing around with um and I'm waiting
505:25 - for this to finish its install and it
505:26 - should you know come up and pop up here
505:29 - if it doesn't I can click down here
505:31 - below and it looks like it's ready to go
505:33 - so I'm not having to do any additional
505:35 - configurations again this other account
505:38 - already has co-pilot activated but while
505:41 - I'm here what I want to do is show you
505:43 - in my settings
505:44 - the co-pilot options so if I go down
505:47 - here below you'll notice here that we
505:49 - have um this feature enabled so because
505:53 - it is a business organization I had to
505:55 - go into that one and turn it on but if
505:57 - it's enabled and I did enable it then I
506:00 - I think that's the reason why I picked
506:01 - it up because the first time I did this
506:03 - it didn't install that chat and then I
506:05 - had to go into the settings and say turn
506:07 - and enable chat and then now it seems to
506:09 - automatically install so um I think the
506:12 - chat's right over here so that's really
506:14 - good
506:15 - and then down below is we can click this
506:17 - to bring it open let's go take a look at
506:19 - what our keyboard shortcuts are because
506:21 - that's going to really tell us how to
506:22 - use this and so we have control forward
506:25 - slash so accept panel
506:27 - suggestion alt uh Square brace next or
506:31 - previous open completion panels contrl X
506:34 - suggest terminal
506:35 - commands uh inline trigger so we'll try
506:38 - our best to try to figure this stuff out
506:40 - there's clearly a lot more stuff going
506:42 - on here like explain this
506:45 - and other things like that so I mean
506:47 - explain this might be a really useful
506:48 - one to have or generate docs that seems
506:51 - pretty cool but what we'll do is go
506:53 - ahead and make ourselves a new file and
506:55 - pretend that we are programmers I a
506:56 - programmer but you know we're all
506:58 - pretending we're
506:59 - uh that's fine anyway I don't know where
507:02 - I'm going with that let's go ahead and
507:03 - make a game so I'm going to go ahead and
507:04 - type in game RB and here it says press
507:07 - to ask GitHub co-pilot to do something
507:11 - so let's go ahead and click that and ask
507:12 - it to generate some code I'll say um
507:15 - create a game Loop
507:18 - for a
507:20 - terminal uh tick tac toe game okay so
507:26 - I'll hit
507:27 - enter and there's a lot of different
507:29 - ways you can interact with it this is
507:30 - like one way you can do it in the chat
507:32 - copy and paste and do other things but
507:34 - it's starting to get this stuff set up
507:36 - uh and the thing is that this is
507:37 - actually pulling from real repos so it's
507:39 - not like magic it's actually going out
507:41 - and leveraging a lot of public repos
507:43 - which I'm not really happy about but um
507:46 - it does get the job done and so we
507:47 - already have a game generated out here
507:49 - does it start the game for us it looks
507:51 - like it does and so let's go ahead and
507:52 - see if we can play it so I'm going to go
507:54 - ahead and type in Ruby and type in game.
507:57 - RB and hit enter and boom we got a game
508:00 - so enter your move row and column so I'm
508:03 - going to say it doesn't tell me like
508:05 - whatever I'm going to say one and one so
508:07 - I guess that's
508:08 - Center and is this the second player now
508:11 - so zero and
508:13 - zero
508:15 - and then we have one and uh so one and
508:17 - one what happens there invalid move okay
508:19 - so zero and
508:22 - one and then I'm just trying to
508:25 - purposely lose here so two and
508:27 - two and then zero and three zero and two
508:33 - so there's a few things about this game
508:34 - that's not really good it doesn't tell
508:36 - us the grid numbers it doesn't have an
508:39 - AI to play against a simple AI um it
508:42 - doesn't tell us um few things there so
508:44 - maybe we can make some improvements uh
508:47 - we can go to the chat and and I think
508:48 - the chat is like aware of our code so it
508:50 - should be able to make some
508:52 - modifications but I really like the fact
508:54 - that we had that little box in
508:57 - place um
508:59 - so looking through
509:01 - this I want to look where the board is
509:04 - being rendered I know Ruby really well
509:05 - so this is really easy for me to read
509:09 - and I'm looking for
509:11 - puts where does it render the board
509:17 - where are you rendering up here display
509:19 - the board and so method to display the
509:21 - board
509:22 - [Music]
509:23 - game the
509:25 - board should
509:27 - show the
509:29 - coordinates on the uh
509:33 - uh of each cell sure why
509:37 - not and I'm not sure how we would tell
509:39 - it to do that if I select
509:42 - that say
509:44 - modify this code to code to
509:48 - show the
509:52 - coordinates for each
509:55 - cell all right and see what we can
510:02 - do all right and so we'll copy this
510:05 - function we'll paste it on back in
510:07 - here say allow and we'll try this again
510:10 - we'll see what we
510:12 - get and it's not exactly what I want uh
510:16 - no so say no I want the
510:20 - coordinates on the outside of the
510:25 - board that's board border I me say
510:28 - board there we go that looks like a
510:30 - little bit more of what I want so we'll
510:32 - go ahead and try
510:34 - that okay we'll stop this and so now
510:38 - that makes a lot more sense okay so now
510:40 - I can go 0 0 and I'm I'm less uh
510:44 - confused about which one it is um so
510:48 - that's really good the next thing is I
510:50 - don't want to be playing against myself
510:52 - I want to have some
510:53 - AI um you know how can
510:58 - I uh can you write a simple Tick Tac to
511:03 - AI for my game
511:10 - code and it's going to do that so it's
511:13 - making a separate function which
511:14 - actually is a good
511:15 - idea and so that's actually what I
511:18 - wanted I wanted an inputed an output
511:20 - this code assumes that you have a game
511:22 - over
511:24 - function um do we have that yeah we do
511:27 - let's go ahead and see if that
511:35 - works but where do we use this
511:41 - function this this code assumes that you
511:43 - have a game over method that checks if a
511:45 - player has won the game the AI move
511:46 - method first checks if the AI can win
511:48 - the next move if it can it makes the
511:50 - move if it can't it checks the player if
511:51 - there's no winning um so the question is
511:54 - where you know where do I call this
511:57 - function in my code I'm checking to see
512:01 - if it understands the context of it it's
512:02 - loading in game. RB so clearly he's
512:04 - using that file to figure it
512:06 - out so it's saying here you should call
512:08 - the AI move function in your game
512:10 - Loop um so here it's updated our game
512:13 - Loop
512:17 - um the loop starts up there's a loop
512:23 - here and then this here is all I move so
512:26 - this is our main game Loop I'm just
512:28 - going to bring this on down here so it's
512:29 - less
512:30 - confusing okay
512:35 - and it looks like it's Rewritten it so
512:37 - we have update
512:38 - board I don't have display board in
512:42 - here
512:45 - this code will make the AI play its turn
512:48 - whenever the AI is turned the AI move
512:50 - function will decide the best move and
512:52 - update the board where is the display
512:56 - board in this
512:58 - Loop is this Loop
513:03 - incomplete could we also put the loop I
513:07 - was complete incomplete because it
513:09 - doesn't look complete to
513:12 - me
513:20 - all right so now it's actually completed
513:21 - it kind of lied but that's fine and so
513:24 - we'll go ahead and just copy this I mean
513:27 - I knew what to do there but that's fine
513:28 - and look it took out the uh while loop
513:30 - so it clearly changed its
513:32 - code let's go ahead and see if that
513:34 - works now um so I'm going to go ahead
513:36 - and do
513:39 - that and another thing that I would like
513:41 - to know is could it indicate
513:44 - can you indicate who's turn well we'll
513:47 - just play the game and see what happens
513:48 - first so I'm going to say 0
513:51 - 0 it says wrong number of arguments for
513:54 - game over let's go take a look at that I
513:56 - think it was suggesting that game over
513:58 - might be a little bit different so this
513:59 - says board and player and so I'm going
514:02 - to put player in here for a
514:05 - second and I don't see player getting
514:07 - called here um what
514:10 - about the new game over
514:21 - function yeah so it's going to try to
514:24 - update
514:29 - that you passed
514:34 - player and there's ways of doing uh like
514:38 - co- completion in line I just kind of
514:39 - forget but this is the way I kind of use
514:42 - it so every tools a little bit different
514:44 - I'm sure if I did a uh course on how to
514:47 - use these tools i' would be a lot more
514:48 - thorough about it but I think this is
514:50 - sufficient enough let's see if it takes
514:52 - that okay and we'll say Z 0 wrong number
514:57 - of arguments so you can see like how
514:59 - this can be a little bit finicky to get
515:01 - something working um you really do need
515:03 - to know what you're looking at it is
515:05 - definitely a very powerful
515:07 - tool um but as you can see you got to
515:09 - keep working through it uh here maybe
515:11 - we'll just do current player I think
515:12 - it's because we still still have one
515:13 - more check
515:15 - here okay 0 0 there we go now it's
515:20 - moving um we'll say one
515:24 - one okay blocked me
515:28 - 02 there we go we'll say one Zer and
515:34 - then one two or 21 sorry
515:39 - 21 and it messes up here at the end I'm
515:42 - not sure why but for the most part it
515:45 - almost worked this is line 121 so I can
515:47 - go to line
515:48 - 121 and it has an issue updating the
515:51 - board for some
515:52 - [Music]
515:53 - reason so and it's on 114 so I could
515:56 - jump to line 114
516:00 - here and yeah so maybe it just doesn't
516:02 - really have a way of ending the game
516:05 - gracefully but hey it did code it so
516:06 - that's pretty
516:12 - impressive we didn't really use those
516:14 - hotkeys but again it depends if you're
516:15 - going to be chat driven or if you're
516:17 - going to use the console here we could
516:18 - take a look at some of those hot keys
516:20 - and just quickly try to use
516:22 - them okay so we'll go back into
516:26 - whoops into
516:29 - our edit
516:31 - settings
516:33 - and
516:38 - whoops hot Keys here there we go control
516:40 - for slash accept a panel suggestion
516:46 - suggest terminal
516:48 - command trigger inline suggestion alt
516:51 - back
516:52 - slash so we'll do alt backlash and see
516:55 - what it
516:56 - does
517:00 - nope it clearly is trying to do
517:02 - something down below I think it did
517:04 - something yeah so I think maybe it's
517:06 - like
517:08 - um code and see it is also trying to
517:11 - autocomplete things but
517:14 - function for
517:17 - scoreboard go here and it's thinking
517:19 - down below so if it didn't do that we
517:21 - could have probably hit the hot key but
517:22 - it's apparently doing it I'm going to
517:23 - hit tab to grab that so you can see it
517:25 - kind of helps as you're coding but you
517:28 - learn how to use it as you use it we're
517:29 - not building something big here and I
517:31 - think this is sufficient so we'll call
517:32 - this one done I'm going to go ahead and
517:34 - stop this workspace so open up the
517:36 - command pallet
517:38 - stop and I will see you in the next one
517:40 - okay
517:42 - ciao
517:46 - hey this is Angie Brown and we are
517:47 - taking a look at GitHub codespaces this
517:50 - is a cloud developer environment or also
517:52 - known as a CDE Integrated with your
517:55 - GitHub repo and the idea is that you
517:58 - have this thing called a codespace
518:00 - that's what they call their developer
518:01 - environment and a codespace runs Ubuntu
518:04 - Linux socer container on a virtual
518:06 - machine hosted and managed by GitHub so
518:09 - this is kind of a representation of how
518:11 - it works um I don't write it here but
518:13 - the idea is that when you launch up
518:15 - GitHub codes spaces it's actually
518:16 - cloning your GitHub um repository so you
518:20 - can start working with it right away uh
518:22 - and most Cloud developer environments do
518:24 - that so that's a pretty common pattern
518:26 - and it's going to clone that repo into a
518:28 - workspaces folder so you can interact
518:32 - with codespaces via multiple ways we
518:35 - have the SSH via SSH via the GitHub CLI
518:40 - you have code editors such as vs code
518:42 - browser the desk to Jet brains IDE um
518:45 - for the desktop you can just open that
518:47 - up in the browser mode by going to open
518:49 - and vs code desktop and it does give you
518:51 - a bit more flexibility than the browser
518:53 - because there could be extensions that
518:55 - only work uh locally and you know it's
518:59 - just you get a better experience there
519:00 - but I usually use everything in the
519:02 - browser because I don't like to do local
519:04 - development anymore I'm totally moved
519:05 - over to the cloud but uh for the get
519:08 - upsi commands we do have a lot there so
519:10 - that's a great way to programmatically
519:12 - work with your GitHub codes spaces uh
519:15 - when you create a new codes space you'll
519:16 - have to choose the repo the branch the
519:18 - region the machine type and that shows
519:21 - that all there that gives you a good
519:22 - idea of how you can configure uh your
519:25 - code space uh the regions you can choose
519:27 - from Is Us East US West Europe West uh
519:30 - southeast Asia and the australas and you
519:33 - know what I think when I first launched
519:34 - I don't know if it always shows me this
519:36 - options but if you need to choose these
519:38 - options you can make sure you get that
519:39 - stuff uh there is a capacity of your
519:42 - environment based on the virtual machine
519:43 - type so the more uh the larger it is the
519:46 - more expensive it is and they they go
519:48 - based on cores so you can see the larger
519:50 - the cores the more RAM and the more
519:54 - storage you're going to get that second
519:55 - value being the storage you can see all
519:58 - your code spaces across all your repos
520:00 - at github.com codespaces and the way
520:03 - you're going to start a codespace is if
520:05 - you drop down that code under the codes
520:08 - spaces tab you can go ahead and create
520:10 - it on a particular Branch that's usually
520:12 - what you want to do is say I want to
520:14 - launch this on Main Branch or Dev Branch
520:17 - you can obviously use the GitHub CLI to
520:20 - open up code spaces there is a limit of
520:22 - concurrent code spaces allowed to run if
520:24 - you hit that limit you may need to stop
520:26 - other code spaces first I don't know if
520:28 - this is the case but there might also be
520:30 - a hotkey within GitHub repo but we if
520:33 - I'll have to go double check that uh
520:34 - before we talk about it
520:40 - okay hey this is Andrew Brown and this
520:42 - fall along I want to take a look at some
520:43 - of the configuration options when we
520:45 - launch up our code spaces so I'm going
520:47 - to switch back to my um other account
520:50 - here and we'll go into the fun repo and
520:52 - what I want to do is open up this code
520:54 - Tab and normally what we would do is
520:57 - we'd launch a code space here but I
520:59 - really want to choose the options that I
521:01 - use to configure it with and so you can
521:02 - see we have some other things here we'll
521:05 - go config with options and this is where
521:07 - we're going to get the choice of
521:09 - choosing our Branch choosing our region
521:12 - choosing our machine type and so that is
521:15 - the way that we can do it notice that
521:16 - we're limited to two and four cores this
521:19 - is probably because we don't have a
521:20 - credit card attached and so it is very
521:22 - limited I'm curious to see what it is in
521:24 - my other account which could have some
521:26 - paid capabilities so I'm just going to
521:28 - quickly switch over to that and take a
521:30 - look there so let's say we went into the
521:32 - exam Pro repo because definitely we're
521:35 - paying on exam Pro for sure and let's
521:38 - just say I'm doing terraform beginner
521:39 - I'm going to go here and go to Cod
521:41 - spaces and say with options and see if
521:44 - we get more options and yeah look we do
521:46 - get more options so that definitely is a
521:48 - factor for the things that you're going
521:49 - to be able to see so that is pretty
521:52 - clear let's go back over uh to here and
521:56 - I want to again go back to this
521:58 - repo and and I mean we definitely do
522:01 - want to open one for code spaces but
522:03 - we're going to go ahead and delete this
522:04 - one I really just want to get to the
522:05 - repo itself and let's go take a look uh
522:09 - yeah here again and I mean I never
522:12 - looked at this before so I'm really
522:14 - curious uh what's under here for
522:16 - configure Dev container oh it just opens
522:18 - it up in Json so nothing super
522:20 - interesting but it's nice to see they
522:21 - have some documentation here as you're
522:23 - working on that file to help you
522:24 - configure it I could have probably used
522:26 - that later on so um I guess we'll take a
522:29 - look at that but really it's simple
522:30 - we'll just go ahead and say with options
522:33 - and we'll be very explicit about how we
522:34 - launch it main now pretty
522:36 - straightforward we'll go ahead and
522:38 - launch a code space and so all I really
522:39 - want to do is just show you the command
522:42 - pallet in here for code spaces as we've
522:44 - already used codes spaces a lot in this
522:46 - course but um you know just go here and
522:49 - show you some of the command poet
522:50 - options so if we go to the command
522:52 - pallet which was down below here we type
522:55 - in code spaces this is where we're going
522:57 - to get a lot of the actions actually I'm
522:59 - surprised I didn't make a slide on this
523:00 - but um you can see that we have a few
523:02 - different things so uh we can change our
523:05 - Mach machine type here we can manage our
523:06 - secrets from here we can rebuild our
523:08 - container if we change our Dev container
523:11 - file um you know we can stop our
523:13 - workspace so a lot of stuff here but I'm
523:15 - going to go ahead and stop our current
523:18 - workspace okay CU that's good enough for
523:20 - me for now and we'll go back over to
523:24 - GitHub let's take a look at what we have
523:26 - in our
523:27 - settings so we go here we go down to
523:30 - code spaces and so we can have our
523:33 - secrets here we can have settings sys
523:35 - which just turned on and it doesn't seem
523:36 - to ever work and we have some additional
523:39 - options so we have access and security
523:40 - this might be oh I guess it's no longer
523:43 - here we can choose the default Editor to
523:45 - launch in uh the idle time the host
523:48 - image whether we want to use beta or
523:50 - stable or manually set our region but it
523:53 - seems like it autod detects but yeah
523:55 - it's pretty straightforward but we'll
523:56 - look at these features as we uh go
523:58 - through this codes spaces section so
524:00 - there you
524:00 - [Music]
524:04 - go let's take a look at the GitHub
524:06 - codespaces life cycle there was no
524:08 - diagram so I'm the first one to make one
524:11 - uh if that's even that exciting but
524:13 - usually the first thing that's going to
524:14 - happen is you want to create your Cod
524:15 - space and technically reopening is kind
524:17 - of similar so we could say create or
524:19 - reopen and from there we want to get our
524:21 - codes space running once our codes space
524:23 - is running uh we can stop it and of
524:26 - course stopping it freezes the state of
524:28 - your workpace so you can use it again
524:30 - later and the idea is that if we wanted
524:33 - to reuse it we just reopen it and it'll
524:35 - run again if let's say our um code our
524:39 - environment timed out for any reason
524:41 - maybe we walked away from our computer
524:42 - computer maybe we just forgot that we
524:44 - forgot to turn it off maybe we had some
524:46 - kind of interruption uh code spaces is
524:48 - going to turn off by default after 30
524:50 - minutes of activity um it's basically
524:52 - the same thing as doing a a stop and
524:54 - it's the equivalent um yeah it's the
524:56 - equivalent of doing a stop there so this
524:58 - is just to keep cost low for you um you
525:02 - know if you want to make changes to your
525:04 - Dev container file which is going to say
525:06 - what your base images and stuff that's
525:08 - installed you have to do a rebuild in
525:10 - the current environment that's the only
525:11 - way it's going to do do that if you're
525:13 - launching up a codes space for the first
525:15 - time it's going to build it from that
525:16 - Dev container but sometimes you have to
525:18 - do rebuilds uh the environment gets
525:20 - saved periodically so generally you not
525:23 - losing data so when you abruptly close
525:25 - and then it stops it's persisting data
525:27 - to the virtual machine as long as it's
525:29 - not deleted but still assume that that
525:31 - environment is uh possible to be lost I
525:35 - think after a certain amount of time it
525:36 - will actually delete um a repo after a
525:40 - certain amount of days so just
525:42 - understand that you know if it's
525:43 - something really important make sure to
525:44 - commit it and put it in a temporary
525:46 - Branch or working Branch um it does
525:48 - Autos saving so with the VSS code
525:50 - browser it will autosave on by default
525:52 - for vsod desktop Autos saave needs to be
525:54 - turned on apparently but when I was
525:57 - using it I never ran into any issues it
525:59 - just seem to work uh when you're
526:00 - deleting when you're done with your uh
526:03 - your environment you can delete it uh
526:05 - you don't have to delete it if you think
526:07 - you're going to start it up again
526:08 - because you're not uh having any spend
526:10 - while it's deleted but there could be
526:12 - some limit in terms of how many
526:13 - workspaces you have or code spaces so
526:16 - you might need to delete some but there
526:17 - you
526:18 - [Music]
526:21 - go so when you create a code space it's
526:24 - going to be assigned an autogenerated
526:26 - display name and so in this case it made
526:28 - shiny space chainsaw and sometimes when
526:31 - you have a lot of um code spaces it gets
526:34 - confusing what is the contents of those
526:36 - codes spaces so it's totally possible
526:38 - for you to rename uh your codes space
526:41 - and that's just going to make things a
526:43 - lot easier you can see all of those
526:45 - codes spaces at/ codespaces and it'll
526:48 - just make it a lot clearer
526:50 - [Music]
526:53 - okay hey this is Andrew Brown and this
526:55 - fall along we're going to take a look at
526:56 - how to rename a GitHub codespace so
526:59 - let's hope that we already have one here
527:01 - so that we can rename it if you don't
527:03 - you'll have to make a new one this one's
527:04 - called shiny Cod not a great name not a
527:07 - great a great name whatsoever but let's
527:10 - go ahead and rename it and I'm going to
527:12 - call this one uh just Dev okay and we'll
527:15 - keep it right nice and simple here and
527:17 - so now it's been renamed Dev and so
527:18 - let's go take a look at our code spaces
527:20 - so we can see the renaming of that so
527:23 - it's not here I got to go back a little
527:25 - bit and so now we can see all of our
527:27 - code spaces and there it is so we have
527:30 - our um our repo here and it's called Dev
527:34 - and that is a lot better than before so
527:37 - that's all I wanted to show
527:41 - you
527:43 - let's take a look at some vs code um
527:45 - configurations in the context of GitHub
527:47 - codes spaces so the idea is that GitHub
527:50 - codes spaces should persist your vs code
527:51 - settings so you get a similar
527:53 - environment across code spaces so far I
527:57 - haven't had that experience I have no
527:58 - way of figuring out how to configure
528:00 - that but it seems like it's supposed to
528:02 - to work so if you figure it out please
528:04 - tell me but I'll just pretend that it
528:05 - does work somehow um if you've never
528:08 - used vs code before there's this thing
528:10 - called settings and it's a little bit
528:13 - more complicated than that because all
528:15 - this stuff that you're editing in the UI
528:17 - is actually updating a settings. Json
528:20 - file um it gets synced and backed up I'm
528:22 - assuming on uh GitHub maybe it goes
528:25 - somewhere else you can see there's a
528:26 - backup and sync settings you can
528:28 - override settings Json options in your
528:30 - Dev container json. file let's take a
528:33 - look at vs code extensions so GitHub
528:36 - codes spaces should persist I use the
528:37 - word should because again I'm not
528:40 - getting it to work for me the idea is
528:42 - that you can install your extensions um
528:45 - most vs code Marketplace extensions are
528:46 - available to install in the vs code
528:48 - browser for GitHub code spaces you can
528:50 - ensure your extensions reliable load
528:52 - every time by setting them in the dev
528:54 - container. Json we have vs code theme
528:57 - this allows you to change the look of
528:59 - your vs code um and you know this is a
529:02 - personal choice of what you want to
529:04 - choose but those kind of choices you're
529:05 - not supposed to put in your Dev
529:07 - container. Json fall for some reason um
529:09 - but yeah there you
529:11 - go
529:14 - [Music]
529:15 - there are two options or configuration
529:18 - options you should know for GitHub code
529:20 - spaces and that's timeout and retention
529:22 - period um so timeout is how long code
529:26 - spaces should wait to stop a code space
529:29 - when there has been no activity you can
529:31 - set this to be as low as 5 minutes up to
529:34 - a maximum of 4 hours and the default is
529:36 - 30 minutes for default retention this is
529:39 - saying when should we start deleting
529:41 - your codes space if they are inactive
529:44 - you could set it to a minimum of zero
529:45 - days uh to a maximum of 30 days and the
529:48 - default is 30 so play around these
529:50 - values and figure out what works best
529:52 - for
529:53 - [Music]
529:57 - you so there is an option called sync
530:00 - settings for code spaces which will pull
530:03 - your sync settings and the idea is it's
530:05 - supposed to uh continually reset it so
530:08 - vs code sync settings lets you share
530:10 - your Visual Studio code configuration so
530:12 - such as settings key uh key bindings and
530:14 - assult extensions across your machines
530:16 - so you are always working with your
530:18 - favorite setup this has not worked so
530:20 - far for me I don't know what I'm doing
530:22 - wrong but um you know it is an option I
530:25 - have it turned on in my account but uh
530:28 - supposedly this is an offering uh that
530:30 - is available for code
530:33 - [Music]
530:36 - spaces you can configure GitHub code
530:38 - spaces to use dot files from a specific
530:41 - repo that will be used for all feature
530:42 - code spaces that you start so the idea
530:45 - is you checkbox this on you specify the
530:46 - repo it's going to pull the dot files
530:49 - from this repo into all future code
530:51 - spaces that you start up um GitHub
530:53 - clones your selected do file repos to
530:55 - the code space environment looks for one
530:57 - of the following files to set up your
530:59 - environment so we have install sh
531:01 - bootstrap setup sh and a bunch of others
531:05 - um so you can see that you could
531:07 - probably offset some of the
531:09 - configuration that would be in Dev
531:10 - container into this as post boot scripts
531:15 - um but yeah there you
531:17 - [Music]
531:20 - go codespace is deep link is just a way
531:23 - for you to generate out a URL that will
531:26 - launch a codespace for a specific repo
531:29 - so here is a look at the actual URL it
531:31 - says codesp spaces. new SL and then the
531:33 - repo name but you can get this deep link
531:36 - through dropping down the code Tab and
531:38 - then you can get either the URL or HTML
531:41 - or Mark up to make it really easy to
531:43 - launch it and when you do launch it it's
531:45 - going to bring you to the create a new
531:47 - codespace uh workspace you can checkbox
531:49 - the quick start if you want to skip that
531:51 - but that's all it really is it's just a
531:52 - sharable
531:53 - [Music]
531:57 - link so when you're using codes spaces
531:59 - you might have uh environment variables
532:01 - or uh passwords or Secrets or access
532:04 - tokens that you don't want to hardcode
532:07 - into your code because that's just a bad
532:08 - habit uh it's just going to lead into uh
532:11 - serious issues so you need to inject
532:13 - them some way in environment when they
532:14 - launch up from a secure location that is
532:17 - what Cod spaces Secrets does so you can
532:19 - see in this example we have eight of
532:20 - those credentials and the idea it will
532:22 - get get is that we'll get loaded in the
532:23 - environment so we'll go take a look at
532:25 - that
532:26 - [Music]
532:29 - okay hey this is angrew brown in this
532:31 - video I want to take a look at how to
532:33 - set secrets for code spaces so we'll go
532:36 - to the repo there might be a few
532:37 - different ways that we can set it what I
532:39 - want to do is go first check if we can
532:41 - do it this this way no but uh we can go
532:44 - over to our settings and we'll check out
532:48 - code spaces here on the left hand side
532:50 - and from here if we scroll well it's
532:52 - actually right up here we can create a
532:54 - new secret and so let's just pretend
532:56 - that we have a super secret we'll just
532:58 - make up something here and we'll just
533:00 - say
533:01 - Roadhouse uh a bunch of numbers and then
533:04 - a dollar sign and a net sign okay and we
533:06 - can even say what repo it's for so it's
533:08 - for the fun repo we're going to go ahead
533:10 - and add that secret now let's go launch
533:12 - up uh a code spaces and see if it's
533:15 - available so I'm going to go back to
533:16 - that
533:19 - repo
533:21 - and yeah we'll go back over
533:23 - here we might already have one from
533:26 - before I'm going to go ahead and delete
533:27 - that and I'm just going to launch a new
533:29 - one so that we are squeaky
533:32 - clean and I'm not sure why it's giving
533:34 - me all these options I just want to
533:35 - launch one we'll go back over here we'll
533:38 - try this again we'll say create one on
533:41 - Main and we'll hope that that gets
533:43 - loaded in so I'll be back here when this
533:45 - is fully loaded okay all right so now
533:47 - that our environment's up I'm going to
533:48 - assume that those secets were loaded via
533:50 - the environment variables so I'm just
533:52 - going to bump up the font here for a
533:53 - moment we're not going to spend too much
533:54 - time in here and I'm going to type in
533:57 - andv and actually we'll just hit enter
533:59 - and see what we get so we have a bunch
534:02 - environment variables that doesn't help
534:03 - so much so I'm going to go back and type
534:05 - in GP and we'll type in super and there
534:07 - it is so we can now access that as an
534:10 - environment variable I could code out if
534:12 - I want super secret and there we go so
534:15 - that's all I really wanted to show you
534:17 - uh and I'll see you in the next one okay
534:19 - so before I do that I'll just stop this
534:22 - environment and yeah we'll see you now
534:26 - [Music]
534:30 - ciao so visual studio code Dev
534:33 - containers allows you to configure your
534:35 - Docker containers via Json file so you
534:37 - can use this in code spaces you can use
534:39 - this with vs code in general so the dev
534:42 - container Json file is expected in the
534:44 - root of your project and there's an
534:46 - example of a very simple one let's go
534:48 - look at some common configuration so you
534:50 - can quickly understand how this file
534:52 - Works um usually you want to provide a
534:54 - remote image so this is the one um that
534:57 - is I think being used for a base image
535:00 - for Microsoft and a lot of the um
535:03 - features that you can add to it uh you
535:05 - can build your own images by supplying
535:07 - the docker file in your project and
535:10 - Supply it some arguments
535:12 - uh there are features that allow you to
535:14 - quickly install certain programs we did
535:17 - this earlier um I think in our uh quick
535:20 - and dirty um git crash course but the
535:23 - idea is that we can install these
535:25 - features so we can get quickly moving uh
535:28 - and this is specifically for the common
535:29 - base image if you want to create your
535:30 - own features you totally could but it
535:32 - has to be for your uh image you can also
535:35 - uh configure custom programs you usually
535:37 - put that in your Docker file um you
535:40 - could also use the post crate command to
535:42 - run a um shell script so there's a lot
535:44 - of ways to um do Post configuration or
535:48 - try to do something very similar and as
535:50 - I said you can create your own features
535:51 - to quickly install on top of your own
535:53 - base images it is a lot of work to make
535:55 - features though um setting settings
535:57 - allow you to configure the settings of
535:59 - vs code so that is a block that you can
536:02 - put in there and you can see we also
536:03 - have one for extension so it knows what
536:05 - to install next time we can tell what
536:07 - ports to always forward which is really
536:09 - useful if you're running web servers we
536:11 - have command Flags uh uh at or we can
536:15 - pass command Flags to R uh Docker run
536:19 - with the run args so that's something
536:21 - that might be useful for you if you need
536:22 - to pass environment variables you set
536:24 - that in the container
536:26 - EnV uh you can mount uh a bunch of
536:29 - locations and then map the the files and
536:31 - folders so we'll take a quick look here
536:33 - at some of the options so we bind mount
536:35 - a local directory Mount a Docker volume
536:38 - for persistent storage Mount the docker
536:40 - socket mount a specific file mount a
536:43 - host directory as a read only okay um
536:48 - the command that runs after creation is
536:50 - the post create command you can set the
536:53 - default username that a vs code should
536:55 - use when connecting to the container you
536:57 - can uh you could use the post create
536:59 - command to install a bunch of programs
537:01 - on top of your base uh container and
537:04 - that's pretty much it so there is
537:05 - obviously a lot that goes in with these
537:07 - Dev containers I find them really hard
537:09 - to configure I don't want to spend too
537:11 - much time doing them uh and the exam's
537:13 - not going to ask you about um uh this
537:16 - stuff but for practic practicality we
537:18 - should know it because if we're working
537:20 - with code spaces or vs code it's
537:21 - definitely something you're going to
537:22 - come across but there you
537:24 - [Music]
537:27 - go let's take a look at how you would
537:29 - change the shell for um GitHub codes
537:32 - spaces so the idea is that uh vs the vs
537:35 - code browser comes with bash fish zsh so
537:39 - you do have a few options in order to
537:42 - change your shells I usually just use
537:45 - bash but um you know maybe you like
537:46 - something else is there some way to get
537:48 - power shell on there probably but I
537:50 - didn't look into it and the way you
537:52 - configure that is in your Dev container
537:54 - so the idea is that uh let's say you
537:56 - wanted to bring in one called uh cssh
538:00 - and so you would specify the path of
538:02 - where it is so this is CS CSH but you
538:05 - know you might have to be very specific
538:06 - where it is and then that way you can uh
538:10 - uh have it in your profile profiles as a
538:12 - drop down um notice that if you are
538:15 - using um vs code for very specific OS
538:19 - distributions then you can set the
538:21 - default uh there um but yeah that's
538:23 - about
538:24 - [Music]
538:28 - it the
538:40 - github.com in
538:45 - github.io page the other way is by
538:48 - assembling the URL so you have
538:51 - github.io followed by it
538:59 - github.com so it's very limited in what
539:02 - it can
539:03 - [Music]
539:06 - do so there's two things that look like
539:09 - editors in GitHub and it's important
539:11 - important that we distinguish between
539:12 - the two because on the exam they'll
539:14 - definitely ask you the differences
539:16 - between them so for GitHub it is totally
539:18 - free for code spaces you have a free
539:20 - monthly quota but uh it can charge based
539:23 - on storage or core hours per month and
539:25 - this is usually based on that machine
539:27 - type it'll increase the cost for
539:29 - availability they're available to both
539:31 - on github.com uh for startup it
539:34 - instantly launches there's no Dev
539:36 - container Json configuration for code
539:38 - spaces it takes a few minutes and it
539:39 - does load a Dev container Json on for
539:41 - compute there is no attached compute you
539:43 - can't run code or apps for code spaces
539:45 - you have a dedicated attach VM you run
539:47 - and debug your code and your apps uh
539:50 - there's no terminal access for G
540:05 - [Music]
540:08 - github.com source is source code made
540:11 - freely available for possible
540:13 - modification and redistribution and you
540:15 - might have heard of some of these open
540:17 - source projects like Linux or git or
540:19 - Docker or spark um a lot of times these
540:23 - companies are really well utilized by a
540:25 - very specific company that will have a
540:27 - paid solution and it really does help
540:30 - keep um the project going or help with
540:33 - its mass adoption in the case of git uh
540:36 - git is actually um managed by the Linux
540:39 - foundation so it's not necessarily a
540:41 - project that GitHub manages but GitHub
540:43 - clearly makes a large um makes good use
540:46 - of git so open source uh benefits
540:49 - include things as encouraging Global
540:51 - collaboration speeds up Innovation
540:53 - offers adaptability and customization
540:56 - reduces software costs enhances learning
540:58 - for developers typically high quality
541:01 - and uh things that are typically high
541:02 - quality and reliable provides
541:04 - transparency for trust and security and
541:07 - open source software has often have free
541:09 - community versions which make make it
541:11 - easy for personal developers or small
541:14 - organizations to quickly adopt
541:16 - technology uh if you're looking at that
541:18 - logo that's from The OSI or the open
541:21 - source initiative which is a nonprofit
541:23 - organization they are the steward of the
541:26 - open source definition this is a set of
541:28 - rules that help Define open source
541:30 - software and uh one cool project that
541:32 - they have is they maintain a list of
541:34 - Open Source licensing documents and that
541:36 - way you're able to take these documents
541:38 - and quickly apply them to your projects
541:40 - the top five most popular open source
541:42 - licenses are MIT uh the new Public
541:47 - public or the the new general public
541:50 - license so GPL Apache
541:52 - 2.0 uh lesser general public license so
541:56 - lgpl and the BSD license depending on
542:00 - the license it determines whether
542:02 - someone can re redistribute your code uh
542:05 - as a commercial product or do they have
542:07 - to alert you of how they're utilizing
542:10 - the product or reference you there's all
542:12 - different kinds of licenses and you can
542:14 - pick one which works for your codebase
542:16 - if you choose to make it open
542:18 - [Music]
542:22 - source GitHub sponsors allows GitHub
542:25 - users to collect donations from their
542:27 - GitHub hosted open source projects so
542:29 - here you can see someone can sponsor the
542:31 - octocat so I say projects but of course
542:34 - you can directly do user accounts if
542:36 - it's through patreon um sponsorship
542:38 - payments um are facilitated two way
542:41 - payments through GitHub on github.com
542:43 - payments through patreon on github.com
542:45 - and so you can set it up for a specific
542:48 - repo to get your sponsor button um you
542:51 - can connect your patreon via your
542:52 - account settings I think to get that
542:54 - Global one there uh to receive
542:56 - sponsorship through GitHub on github.com
542:58 - you need to be accepted into the GitHub
543:00 - sponsors program I think this is
543:02 - specifically for if you want GitHub to
543:04 - collect the money on your behalf um you
543:07 - have to apply for it and go onto a
543:08 - waiting list you can do it for personal
543:10 - accounts and organization
543:11 - and you might have to provide uh well
543:13 - you will have to provide banking
543:15 - information in order to get paid GitHub
543:18 - makes it easy to locate people who
543:20 - maintain your dependency so you can
543:22 - support open source contributions you
543:24 - can go to fors sponsors exlore and it'll
543:27 - tell you about uh the like the repos
543:29 - that or sorry the dependencies that
543:31 - you're using your project to suggest um
543:34 - who you could sponsor uh that are
543:37 - helping you out uh in that sense but
543:39 - there you go
543:44 - let's talk about GitHub and open source
543:46 - projects um there is some kind of
543:48 - statement that GitHub makes about open
543:51 - source but I really couldn't figure out
543:54 - what it is that they wanted me to put in
543:56 - this course uh when I took the exam they
543:59 - definitely had some kind of um uh PR
544:03 - kind of language and saying what do you
544:04 - think that uh is github's relationship
544:07 - with open source so just do your best to
544:08 - Guess that I really couldn't assemble it
544:10 - here here so it's hidden in some kind of
544:12 - PR content but let's talk about the
544:13 - practicalities of how GI GitHub works
544:17 - with open source uh one thing is that
544:19 - when you create a repo you can choose a
544:20 - license very easily I imagine that it's
544:22 - from that OSI approved list and then
544:24 - when you go to repo you can see the
544:26 - license clearly displayed um and that
544:29 - will be stored in that license.md that
544:31 - could be license.md license or
544:32 - license.md with all caps they'll all
544:35 - work if you're looking to find open
544:37 - source projects you can use the search
544:39 - to search based on license
544:41 - um there are many open source GitHub
544:44 - repos that are hosted on GitHub um
544:47 - because GitHub offers a lot of stuff for
544:49 - free to uh good open source projects
544:52 - some people will mirror their project so
544:55 - maybe they don't host it primarily on
544:57 - GitHub it they'll make a copy and
544:58 - they'll sync it so that it has
545:00 - redundancy of where it could be you can
545:03 - use um uh you can explore under GitHub
545:06 - topics and GitHub trending in the
545:08 - community Pages uh to try to find open
545:11 - source uh projects based on whether
545:13 - they're popular or for specific
545:15 - categories you can follow
545:17 - organizations and um you can sponsor
545:20 - organizations and so that might be one
545:22 - way of doing that if you're utilizing
545:25 - the GitHub Marketplace they have a bunch
545:26 - of apps in here and a lot of these are
545:29 - open source projects and you'll have uh
545:31 - you'll be able to install them for free
545:33 - so that is uh something else that is
545:35 - really interesting um but yeah there you
545:39 - go
545:42 - hey this is Andrew Brown let's go take a
545:44 - look and figure out what kind of Open
545:46 - Source stuff we can find out on
545:48 - github.com and one thing I think that
545:50 - would be really important to check out
545:51 - is the Community page um so I think it's
545:54 - just here on the Explorer so on the left
545:56 - hand side we'll go to explore we might
545:58 - as well open up the marketplace as well
545:59 - I mean the marketplace is good also for
546:01 - apps um not just for open source but
546:04 - there definitely is open store uh stuff
546:06 - here so like if I go into here I'm not
546:09 - sure if they have an open source license
546:11 - but sometimes you go to plans and they
546:12 - might tell you this one says free not
546:14 - necessarily open source but there are
546:17 - ones that are open source that we can uh
546:19 - find but you do have to do a bit of
546:21 - digging to find them I suppose anyway um
546:24 - if we go to explore this is where we get
546:26 - a kind of a community of information uh
546:28 - you can see what's trending in terms of
546:30 - repos and developers uh we have topics
546:33 - over here where you can drill down into
546:35 - specific things so if you like AWS you
546:38 - can see all of uh these
546:41 - here okay so that makes it pretty clear
546:44 - in terms of
546:46 - discoverability for trending we could
546:48 - look for trending stuff as well over
546:51 - here all right but you know primarily if
546:53 - you're going to find open source stuff I
546:55 - guess you'd have to search for it and
546:56 - look based on the license so we can go
546:59 - here and trying to expand our search but
547:02 - maybe we say
547:04 - license license I have a hard time
547:06 - spelling that and so we can just choose
547:08 - one here say MIT and just hit enter ENT
547:11 - and it'll show us everything that is uh
547:14 - under MIT license so that could be one
547:16 - way that you could explore and try to
547:18 - find things um but yeah hopefully that
547:20 - gives you kind of an idea uh of you know
547:25 - open source maybe we should take a look
547:26 - and see what GitHub thinks they they
547:28 - they want to say about open source
547:30 - GitHub open source they probably have
547:33 - some kind of statement where open source
547:35 - Community lives a PR person definitely
547:37 - wrote this um open source software is
547:39 - free for you to use an explore all right
547:42 - read our open source
547:46 - guides
547:48 - and yeah maybe there's something in here
547:51 - that they would want us to know in the
547:53 - course but it's just a lot of stuff you
547:57 - know what I mean it's nobody wants to
547:58 - read through all this but um yeah I mean
548:01 - there's stuff in here so that's cool I
548:04 - guess but yeah that's open source and
548:06 - GitHub
548:09 - okay
548:10 - [Music]
548:11 - inner source is organization and
548:13 - development best practices for non-open
548:16 - Source or proprietary software the term
548:18 - was coined by Tim orali back in 2000 an
548:21 - inner source is not a strict guideline
548:23 - but a loose strategy to establish an
548:24 - open source like culture within
548:26 - organizations it was really really hard
548:29 - really hard to figure out what this was
548:31 - because they they when they say loose
548:33 - they mean it's really loose um but uh
548:36 - what I found to help make more sense was
548:38 - to look at the free resources provided
548:42 - by the inner Source commons. org where
548:44 - they have a bunch of patterns that you
548:46 - can use um to apply to your organization
548:49 - to start to apply inner Source um and
548:52 - yeah it's just to make sure you adopt
548:53 - open source in a way that is great for
548:56 - the community and your
548:58 - [Music]
549:02 - company all right let's make sure we
549:05 - understand the difference between inner
549:06 - Source versus open source so the scope
549:08 - is a bit different inner sources is
549:09 - within an organ organization remember
549:11 - that word inner so if it's pointing
549:14 - inwards we're talking about the org if
549:16 - it's open source this is public and a
549:18 - global Community um in terms of
549:20 - accessibility in source is limited to
549:22 - company employees where open source is
549:24 - open to everybody for um purpose
549:27 - intersource improves collaboration
549:29 - efficiency internally whereas open
549:31 - source shares and collaborates on
549:33 - projects globally for contributions
549:35 - employees of the organization is for
549:37 - inner source and for open source it's
549:39 - about anybody such as developers or
549:41 - users for visibility in sources code
549:44 - discussions often private to the
549:45 - organization and open source publicly
549:48 - available and visible for governance in
549:50 - sources is based on the internal
549:52 - policies and culture of the organization
549:55 - and for open source it's usly governed
549:56 - by open source licenses and Community
549:58 - rules so there you
550:01 - [Music]
550:04 - go so forking a repo allows you to
550:07 - create a copy of a repo and uh for
550:10 - working allows you to take an open
550:12 - source or Source available repo and Go
550:14 - Your Own Way quickly apply bugs and
550:16 - patch fixes a separate repo to work on
550:19 - for Community contributions you can also
550:21 - uh create cross repo repo poll requests
550:25 - to get accepted into the original repo
550:27 - when you Fork a repo you'll be able to
550:29 - tell because it will say forked from the
550:31 - location underneath if you need to
550:34 - explore other Fork repos you can use the
550:36 - network graph to find uh specific
550:39 - commits to see the difference between
550:41 - your repo and another one is at a glance
550:43 - you may prefer using a forked repo over
550:45 - the original you may find uh the
550:47 - original project abandoned and a fork
550:50 - becoming the go-to repo for a project
550:52 - Forks help keep public projects alive uh
550:55 - on the edge and collaborative so there
550:57 - you
550:58 - [Music]
551:01 - go geta repos can be set as public
551:04 - making repos easily searchable on GitHub
551:06 - via search engines public repos serve a
551:09 - community purpose for knowledge sharing
551:10 - educational resources and open source
551:12 - projects besides just search GitHub
551:15 - curates content via community Pages such
551:17 - as the explore page and the trending
551:19 - page um GitHub provides a robust search
551:23 - not uh that lets us not only search the
551:25 - repo's name but the contents of the repo
551:28 - as you can see in the advanced search we
551:29 - have a lot of options for search uh
551:33 - there is a search syntax where we can
551:36 - utilize a lot of different um of these
551:39 - little filters to find things very
551:41 - quickly the search syntax also supports
551:43 - regular Expressions wild cards not or
551:46 - and multiple terms and more so there you
551:50 - [Music]
551:53 - go hey this is Andrew Brown and this
551:55 - follow along I want to take a look at
551:57 - repository search as it probably will
551:59 - appear on your exam to know how to
552:01 - utilize this so what we'll do is just
552:03 - type in rails and um I'm looking for all
552:07 - results I'm going to click the one up
552:08 - here because I want to get to this more
552:09 - advanced search where we have a bunch of
552:11 - options and where the exam might ask is
552:14 - understanding how to compose a query so
552:17 - you can see we have a lot of options uh
552:19 - here and notice as soon as I click it
552:20 - starts filling them in so um if we just
552:23 - go here for a moment we can just take
552:25 - out rails completely and we could try to
552:28 - do something so we have public oh sorry
552:31 - we'll go down here and try it down here
552:32 - so we say public so is public is
552:34 - something that we could do um we could
552:37 - also specify based on topic
552:40 - I'm not sure what we would put in for
552:41 - topic let's go take a look and and see
552:44 - what is
552:48 - there so I'm not really seeing anything
552:50 - for topic but what we could do we're not
552:53 - exactly sure on all these parameters if
552:54 - we go to advance search down below this
552:56 - kind of basically gives us the same
552:57 - stuff so if I was to search topic here
552:59 - I'm really surprised I can't find what
553:01 - topic is but let's go take a look and
553:03 - see if that actually is something
553:04 - because I'm really curious GitHub repo
553:08 - topic um
553:10 - with topics you can explore
553:13 - repos okay so it looks like we can
553:15 - actually categorize them in certain
553:17 - ways I don't even know that let's go
553:19 - over here ah yes topics here okay so I
553:23 - guess the idea is that we can
553:25 - classify our project based on a topic
553:27 - and so maybe one could be Azure so we
553:29 - could go back over to our search I was
553:31 - kind of curious about that and we say
553:34 - something like topic colon and then
553:36 - Azure and then hit enter and so this
553:38 - could narrow it down to Azure projects
553:42 - maybe we can take out the rails term in
553:43 - the front so we can kind of narrow down
553:45 - exactly what it is we're looking for so
553:48 - now we're getting kind of azure projects
553:50 - we can put like loose search on the end
553:52 - here so let's say we wanted to use bicep
553:54 - which is something that Azure has we
553:56 - could search it that way I'm kind of
553:59 - curious about this topic option because
554:00 - I didn't realize we could set topics so
554:02 - let's go over to our repo and see if we
554:04 - can set that so I'm going to go into our
554:06 - fund repo we'll go into settings and I'm
554:08 - looking for topics
554:11 - so let's find that and the reason I'm
554:13 - interested is because on my exam
554:15 - actually topics came up and I wasn't
554:17 - really aware of being able to set them
554:20 - so yeah let's go see if there's some way
554:22 - we can do
554:24 - that um searching topics on the about
554:29 - page it seems like we can set that so
554:30 - I'm going to go back to my repo here and
554:33 - we'll go here oh we have topics so I
554:35 - could say fun which is not a real topic
554:38 - but we could do that we could say uh
554:42 - beginner and so that's going to provide
554:44 - U topics that are uh really well known
554:47 - and allow people to search for that so I
554:49 - think that's pretty useful so you know
554:51 - get some experience with the
554:52 - discoverable uh or the the search
554:54 - functionality and add some topics and I
554:56 - think that'll be good enough
554:57 - [Music]
555:00 - okay GitHub labels are used to
555:03 - categorize issues pull requests and
555:04 - discussions and the way it works is you
555:06 - can just apply multiple labels to your
555:08 - targeted item and then it should show up
555:11 - beside the item somewhere uh you can
555:13 - manage your labels or create new labels
555:14 - on the labels page for your repo and
555:17 - creating a label is pretty simple it
555:18 - just needs a name a description and a
555:20 - color the GitHub CI provides commands
555:22 - for labels so it is very easy to create
555:26 - [Music]
555:30 - labels Milestones allow you to group
555:32 - multiple issues into an end goal which
555:34 - shows completion towards that goal for
555:36 - each closed issue so the idea is you can
555:38 - make a new milestone you can assign
555:41 - Milestones to it I'm just going to my
555:42 - pen tool out here so you can see but the
555:44 - idea is that as we uh close we get to a
555:48 - completion so if we have one open one
555:50 - Clos we're at 50% and when we're done
555:52 - it's at 100% you can set a date um and
555:55 - there you
555:55 - [Music]
555:59 - go hey it's Andrew Brown and this fall
556:01 - along we want to create some custom
556:03 - labels it's pretty straightforward but
556:05 - uh I figured we should take a look at a
556:07 - more popular repo and see what kind of
556:09 - labels they're using if they've even
556:10 - modified them at all so we're over here
556:12 - on the rbon
556:13 - rails um uh site and you can see we have
556:16 - lots of labels and they're breaking it
556:18 - Down based on uh sub packages and things
556:21 - like that and I'm not sure what this is
556:23 - it looks like maybe open issues you can
556:25 - go here and filter out to that um
556:28 - there's a lot of automation that you can
556:29 - apply with labels um so when you create
556:31 - issues you can have labels being
556:33 - pre-assigned you could have uh pull
556:35 - requests act a certain way based on the
556:36 - labels it has so there's a lot you can
556:39 - do with labels we're not going to show
556:40 - you all those automation features but we
556:42 - will show you how to create your own
556:44 - labels which is pretty straightforward
556:46 - so we'll go into our fund repo and we'll
556:50 - go over to issues and we will create
556:53 - some labels we'll make a new one here
556:56 - called um
556:59 - secret if we haven't already made one
557:01 - before and I'll go ahead and just choose
557:04 - a random color and boom we have our
557:05 - secret label if we go over to our issues
557:08 - we can then go ahead and ass
557:10 - sign all sorts of labels super
557:14 - easy so y there you go that's all you
557:16 - need to know
557:18 - [Music]
557:21 - ciao hey everyone it's angrew brown and
557:24 - this fall along we're going to take a
557:25 - look at Milestones so what we'll do is
557:27 - go to our fun repo and we'll have to
557:29 - create a couple of issues I have one
557:31 - here called what is the best movie ever
557:33 - but then we can say what is the best
557:36 - food
557:37 - ever as our other ticket and then we can
557:40 - figure out what that is later on but the
557:42 - idea is that we want to put this into a
557:44 - new Milestone so what we'll do is go
557:45 - back to issues and we'll create
557:47 - ourselves a new Milestone and we'll call
557:49 - this um liveing life I don't I don't
557:52 - know what to call this but we're going
557:53 - to go ahead and call that um oh that was
557:56 - another issue that wasn't a
557:58 - milestone but that's fine we could
558:00 - always use more Milestones here and
558:01 - we'll create a new Milestone we'll say
558:03 - true living okay and we could set a date
558:07 - in the
558:08 - future and date that we want to complete
558:11 - this and I'm going to go back over to my
558:14 - issues and I'm going to checkbox well
558:17 - first all go into one and we can assign
558:19 - the Milestone this way we can also Mass
558:22 - assign probably this way as well if we
558:25 - go
558:26 - here by the way there's Mass assignment
558:28 - for all these things for issues probably
558:31 - good to know that and now if we go over
558:33 - to our Milestone we have a percentage of
558:36 - how complete it is so if we go back over
558:39 - here
558:40 - we can close a couple of these
558:44 - okay
558:47 - and if we go back over to our Milestone
558:50 - we can see that we've made some progress
558:52 - It's 66% complete I want to show you
558:55 - maybe rails because I have a feeling
558:57 - that they probably have Milestones a lot
558:59 - of Open Source projects will have
559:01 - Milestones to help you know when the
559:02 - next version's coming out so if we go
559:04 - over to issues here and go to Milestones
559:07 - you can get an idea like when the next
559:09 - version is and that's a really great use
559:11 - case for Milestone so we can go in here
559:14 - and see that they only have one more
559:15 - ticket to get version 7.13 out um then
559:19 - we have 8.00 and they have a bunch of
559:21 - other stuff so it is quite interesting
559:24 - how Milestones can be organized but
559:25 - usually this is the use case uh that I
559:27 - see but anyway we'll see you in the next
559:29 - one okay
559:30 - [Music]
559:34 - ciao G up projects is a planning and
559:37 - tracking tool when working on G UB repos
559:40 - and a project has an adaptable view that
559:42 - can be changed at any time between a
559:44 - spreadsheet a taskboard and a road map
559:47 - um so that's kind of the screen where
559:49 - you choose what kind of view you want
559:51 - projects directly integrate with issues
559:52 - and poll requests projects have built in
559:54 - workflows to automate common actions so
559:58 - uh the idea is that a GitHub project is
560:00 - composed of multiple views and you can
560:02 - add more views to your project each
560:04 - views layout can be changed at any time
560:07 - to accommodate the project use case so
560:09 - if you set set up a view you can change
560:10 - it whenever you want uh so let's take a
560:13 - look at what the table looks like so
560:14 - this is a great uh layout if you want a
560:17 - traditional uh ticket tracking system or
560:20 - you have a large amount of tasks then we
560:23 - have the board this is a great layout
560:24 - for agile task and if you need to
560:27 - understand clue the state of your issues
560:29 - it's your basically can band board and
560:31 - then we have road map this is great if
560:32 - you're trying to plan for uh uh tasks
560:36 - based on a timeline we call these
560:38 - normally um
560:40 - Gant charts so that's kind of what that
560:41 - is there for your layout you can
560:43 - configure your data based on multiple
560:45 - options so we got Fields columns Group
560:48 - by sort by field sum slice by zoom level
560:52 - and dates I'm not reading through all
560:53 - this because I didn't see it on the exam
560:55 - so uh you know these are pretty
560:57 - straightforward and you can read these
560:58 - if you want but um yeah so your GitHub
561:02 - project items have custom Fields you can
561:05 - create new fields and add uh and provide
561:08 - options to easily fill in those those
561:09 - fields and I mean that's pretty much the
561:11 - start of it but there we
561:13 - [Music]
561:16 - go let's talk about GitHub projects
561:19 - versus GitHub project classic as this
561:21 - might end up as an exam question and to
561:23 - avoid any confusion if you somehow end
561:25 - up creating a classic project so GitHub
561:28 - projects are new more Dynamic interfaces
561:30 - with tables board and Views uh classic
561:33 - just has a can band board style thing
561:35 - like Trello um GitHub projects are
561:38 - highly customizable different views and
561:40 - Fields the classic is limited
561:42 - customization options uh there is
561:44 - apparently more automation support in
561:46 - the new projects whereas the old one was
561:48 - simpler the new projects has enhanced
561:50 - reporting features and insights whereas
561:52 - classic has basic reporting and tracking
561:54 - uh GitHub projects has deeper
561:55 - integration with GitHub issues and poll
561:57 - requests whereas Classics has basic
561:59 - integration with GitHub repos GitHub
562:01 - projects offers more advanced and
562:03 - flexible project management tools
562:04 - compared to GitHub classic projects
562:06 - which is simpler and more
562:07 - straightforward there's no reason to
562:08 - ever use class unless it's for legacy
562:10 - reason but yeah there you
562:12 - [Music]
562:17 - go GitHub has built-in project workflows
562:20 - that allows you to automate what happens
562:21 - based on specific events in your
562:23 - projects so you have this
562:25 - workflows um area like I think you do
562:28 - the ellipses and you get to workflows
562:30 - and from there you can uh basically
562:32 - change some Behavior so when here it
562:34 - says when a pull request is merg you
562:36 - could say set the value or the status as
562:39 - being being done for this particular
562:41 - field there are the following built-in
562:43 - workflows item added to project item
562:46 - reopened item closed code changes
562:48 - requested code review approved pull
562:51 - request merged Auto archived items Auto
562:54 - add to project and for the exam they
562:58 - will definitely definitely ask you which
563:02 - are some built-in workflows I do not
563:05 - like that question but it's in the exam
563:07 - so make sure you remember the so that
563:09 - you can get an extra point on your exam
563:12 - uh for more advanced automation of
563:14 - GitHub projects you can use GitHub
563:16 - actions and there you
563:17 - [Music]
563:21 - go project insights lets you create
563:24 - charts about your GitHub projects and
563:26 - there are two charts that they want you
563:28 - to know the first is current charts and
563:30 - the second one is historical charts so
563:32 - current charts is basically you take a
563:33 - value and you can plot it as a chart the
563:36 - historical charts is you take values and
563:38 - you plot them over time the exam will
563:41 - definitely ask you about what are the
563:44 - two types of um charts so make sure
563:47 - remember that it's current charts and
563:49 - historical charts there you
563:51 - [Music]
563:54 - go hey this is Andrew Brown and in this
563:56 - follow I want to take a look at uh
563:58 - GitHub projects and by the way I'm not
564:00 - sure if it's picking up but I'm in my
564:02 - snowsuit because it's so darn cold in my
564:04 - office because it's winter and my
564:07 - furnace isn't working so if you hear
564:08 - like scratchy sounds it's because I'm
564:11 - wearing a fullblown uh heavyduty
564:13 - snowsuit okay and you might hear them in
564:16 - other videos but I just wanted to point
564:17 - that out if that you know if you're
564:19 - wondering what that sound is but anyway
564:21 - let's go take a look at our fun repo and
564:24 - from here I want to make our way over to
564:27 - projects and we'll create ourselves a
564:30 - new project I would like this to get out
564:32 - of the way and um I'm going to go ahead
564:34 - and create a new project I should note
564:36 - that um a project can um
564:39 - contain uh tasks and issues from other
564:42 - projects but for the most part I I'd
564:44 - rather make a new one here and so it's
564:47 - just keeps giving me this darn pop get
564:49 - out of the way and so we can choose from
564:51 - a bunch of different templates um I'm
564:54 - going to choose Team Planning because
564:55 - that sounds really good and right away
564:57 - we're going to get a bunch of views
564:59 - across the top so we got our backlog we
565:01 - can go ahead and add an item I'll just
565:03 - say uh watch
565:06 - Roadhouse and write a a
565:10 - review okay and so we'll go ahead and do
565:12 - that and this is a draft so it's not
565:14 - really an issue yet it's kind of like in
565:17 - limbo but you can convert this to an
565:19 - issue and put it in the repo and now I
565:21 - can drag it around and move into other
565:23 - states which is really nice we can go up
565:25 - here to backlog if we don't like the
565:27 - board we can change it to a table this
565:29 - allows us to drop things down in a very
565:31 - nice and easy way it gives us some uh
565:33 - default parameters that came with this
565:35 - project we can go to road map if we want
565:37 - to and we could say need to do it
565:39 - between this time and that time for the
565:42 - scope of our project not super
565:44 - complicated I don't know how this stuff
565:46 - works I fiddled with it it wasn't doing
565:48 - what I thought it was going to do but
565:49 - I'll change this back to a board um we
565:52 - could go and generate at a chart which
565:53 - is going to be in Project insights
565:55 - understand there's two types of charts
565:57 - current charts and historical charts and
565:59 - this one looks like it's a current one
566:00 - so it's not over time and how you would
566:04 - have it in time I have no idea um oh up
566:08 - here so I guess these are the types of
566:10 - layouts we can have so that's pretty
566:12 - cool um so we change that to line or bar
566:17 - or sacked bar uh we can go ahead and hit
566:20 - new chart and I'm trying to figure out
566:23 - how do we get historical
566:24 - charts because I thought it'd be like
566:26 - you choose one or the other
566:28 - but doesn't seem like it's that way it
566:31 - seems like you probably have to group it
566:33 - by something or you'd have to have it
566:35 - based on the
566:37 - timeline like iter or something so yeah
566:41 - I'm not exactly sure how you create the
566:42 - historical chart I don't think it really
566:44 - matters um again this is GitHub
566:46 - foundations we just need to get some
566:47 - familiarity with projects if we go up
566:50 - here in the top right corner um we can
566:53 - get this drop down to get over to our
566:56 - workflows and again I'm going to go
566:58 - through these with you so we have item
566:59 - added to project item reopened item
567:02 - closed you can see there's a couple
567:03 - already sets so when we have an item
567:05 - closed it's going to set the value as
567:08 - done okay so if I go back over to this
567:11 - issue okay and we close
567:14 - it it should get moved to done there we
567:18 - go so see how that automatically moved
567:19 - to done and that's because of that
567:21 - workflow here and so we have some other
567:23 - ones that we could set up if we want we
567:24 - could edit them but these are very very
567:27 - simple as you can see they're very
567:29 - straightforward uh we can go to settings
567:32 - and in settings you can see we have our
567:34 - custom Fields you can add them change
567:36 - the field type to a very specific comp
567:39 - so if you want to say I want to collect
567:40 - the date you could have that there and
567:42 - we call this Roadhouse date which makes
567:45 - no sense but we can do that we go back
567:47 - to our settings we can go to our
567:50 - ticket okay and click it and we can now
567:55 - set our Roadhouse date so yeah hopefully
567:59 - that makes sense but it's pretty darn
568:00 - straightforward and that is GitHub
568:07 - projects
568:09 - [Music]
568:11 - when commenting on issues or pull
568:12 - requests you can add a save reply that
568:14 - you already have set up previously and
568:17 - so if you go to the save replies icon uh
568:19 - you can then go choose run and this is a
568:21 - great way to have like canned responses
568:25 - um I'm sure there are benefits for this
568:27 - it's pretty obvious it saves your time
568:29 - but uh yeah that is a functionality that
568:31 - you can do uh there for uh replying to
568:34 - comments
568:37 - okay
568:38 - [Music]
568:40 - I just want to explicitly point out that
568:41 - you can assign issues and poll requests
568:44 - to specific users right uh you can
568:47 - filter issues and PRS based on assignes
568:49 - and I just wanted to make that call out
568:51 - because in the exam guide they wanted to
568:52 - call it out and I figured I should make
568:54 - a simple slide there so there you
568:57 - [Music]
569:00 - go so securing your account using 2fa uh
569:05 - normally it's called MFA but for
569:07 - whatever reason they're just calling it
569:08 - 2fa cuz it is really only two- Factor
569:10 - authentication this is where you use a
569:12 - secondary device such as a phone to
569:13 - enter a code in as a extra security
569:15 - precaution when sign in or performing
569:17 - sensitive actions and so you can choose
569:20 - your preferred UFA method on GitHub
569:22 - which could be between GitHub Mobile SMS
569:24 - text message or the authenticator app um
569:27 - we have all these options for two-factor
569:29 - authentication so you can use
569:30 - authenticator app like aie which we did
569:33 - use in uh when setting up our account a
569:36 - lot earlier you have Google
569:37 - Authenticator Microsoft authenticator
569:39 - I'm sure there's other ones we could use
569:41 - text messaging we could use a security
569:44 - key like a UB key which is a physical
569:46 - piece of Hardware we can use GitHub
569:48 - mobile which we absolutely do we can
569:50 - have recovery codes which is something
569:53 - that is just a backup in case you get
569:54 - totally locked out of your account and
569:56 - you need to enter those codes in but
569:58 - there you
569:58 - [Music]
570:03 - go personal accounts has two permission
570:06 - levels the first is the reposit to owner
570:08 - owner repository owner I can say it the
570:12 - person who owns the account that would
570:14 - be you and the repositories owned by
570:17 - personal accounts have one owner the
570:19 - ownership can uh permissions cannot be
570:21 - shared with another personal account for
570:24 - collaborators these are people you add
570:27 - as collaborators I cannot tell you how
570:30 - many times I did this slide that's the
570:31 - best I can do it so we'll just live with
570:33 - the way I said that um so let's go
570:36 - through the type of permission that
570:38 - repository actions have they can invite
570:41 - collaborators they can change the
570:42 - visibility of repos limit interactions
570:45 - with repos rename the branch including
570:47 - the default Branch they can merge a pull
570:50 - request on a protected Branch even if
570:51 - there are no approving reviews they can
570:53 - delete the repo they can manage the repo
570:56 - topics they can manage security and
570:58 - Analysis settings for the repo they uh
571:00 - they can enable the dependency graph for
571:02 - a private repo delete and restore
571:04 - packages customize the repo social media
571:06 - preview create a template from the repo
571:09 - control access to dependabot alerts
571:11 - dismiss dependent bot alerts in the repo
571:14 - manage data use for a private repo
571:16 - Define code owners for the repo archive
571:19 - the repo create security advisories
571:22 - display a sponsor button allow or
571:25 - disallow Auto merge for poll requests
571:27 - yes there's a lot of things here I
571:29 - realize this is tiring manage deploy
571:31 - Keys manage web hooks let's take a look
571:34 - at what collaborators can do Fork the
571:36 - repo rename a branch other than the
571:38 - default Branch create and edit delete on
571:41 - commits pull request issues in the repo
571:43 - create assign close and reopen issues in
571:46 - the repo manage labels for issues and
571:48 - pull requests in the repo manage
571:50 - milestones for issues and pull requests
571:52 - in the repo mark an issue or pull
571:54 - request in the repo as a duplicate
571:57 - create and merge close pull requests in
572:01 - the repo enable disable auto merge for a
572:04 - pull request apply suggested changes to
572:07 - pull requests in the repo create a poll
572:09 - request from a fork of the repo submit a
572:13 - review of a poll request that affects
572:15 - the merab ility of the poll request
572:17 - create an edit a Wiki for the repo
572:19 - create an edit releases for the
572:23 - repo ask as a code owner for the repo
572:26 - publish view or installs packages
572:29 - removes themselves as collaborators on
572:32 - the
572:33 - repo okay so that's a lot to remember so
572:37 - just remember this
572:39 - repo owners have full control of the
572:41 - repo collaborators can pull such as read
572:44 - the contents of the repo and push right
572:46 - changes of the repo there you go
572:50 - [Music]
572:54 - ciao Enterprise managed users also known
572:57 - as emus allow you to manage the life
572:59 - cycle and authentication of users on
573:01 - github.com from an external identity
573:03 - management system or IDP GitHub partners
573:07 - with some Developers of identity
573:09 - management systems to provide a pay path
573:11 - integration with emus U the
573:14 - idps yeah idps mostly provide
573:17 - authentication using saml they can use
573:20 - Microsoft entra ID previously known as
573:22 - azuread and also offers oidc for
573:26 - authentication the IDP applications
573:29 - Provisions users with systems for cross
573:32 - doain identity management s
573:34 - cim and I'm going to just tell you on my
573:37 - exam I got so many darn questions about
573:40 - this and I have no idea why but anyway
573:42 - for partner idps you can use Microsoft
573:46 - entra ID formally known as azuread okta
573:49 - and pig Federate they all support samle
573:52 - uh only oid is supported by Microsoft
573:54 - entra ID and then you have
573:57 - SIM now when I say I got questions of
573:59 - the exam it wasn't specifically which
574:01 - partner provided what IDP but it was
574:04 - more just understanding that enterprises
574:06 - have this functionality of of having SCM
574:09 - and O oidc and was it between Enterprise
574:13 - uh server and Enterprise Cloud okay um
574:17 - there we
574:18 - [Music]
574:21 - go hey this is Andrew Brown and this
574:23 - fall along I want to focus a little bit
574:24 - on security as I feel that uh the
574:27 - security section here is a little bit
574:28 - light and maybe by looking at some of
574:30 - the security stuff it might help us on
574:32 - the exam because they do asking about
574:34 - like these scanning things and so I'm
574:37 - hoping that if we look at them you'll
574:38 - remember them so we have dependabot code
574:41 - scanning and secret scanning this is a
574:42 - public repo so we have these options
574:45 - here and uh we have private
574:47 - vulnerability reporting let's see if we
574:48 - can turn that on what happens it's a
574:50 - beta feature let's turn it on can we
574:52 - turn it on it's on there we go can we
574:56 - turn on dependabot alerts let's do it it
574:59 - is
575:00 - on and then we have code scanning so
575:02 - code scanning is a little bit more work
575:04 - it has code ql anal analysis is it easy
575:08 - to set up let's do the default and it
575:10 - says we're using Ruby and we'll enable
575:12 - code ql so all those scans are now set
575:16 - up it was as simple as that I don't
575:17 - think it's going to cost me anything
575:18 - additional because it's a public
575:20 - repo okay and so now those are
575:24 - enabled I thought this one was enabled
575:26 - because we turned it on but maybe not
575:28 - secret scanning would be something that
575:29 - would be really good so let's go ahead
575:31 - and try that out secret scanning let's
575:33 - enable that as well and boom there you
575:36 - go you got all that stuff in place it's
575:38 - no more complicated than that we do also
575:41 - see secrets and uh variables here so it
575:43 - looks like it kind of uh bring brings
575:46 - them all into one place so we sought for
575:48 - code spaces but I guess GitHub actions
575:50 - can have secrets as well dependabot can
575:53 - have secrets as well looks like the same
575:55 - kind of functionality across the board
575:56 - for all of these we were basically just
575:58 - looking at code security analysis so you
576:01 - know that's that we can go over to our
576:03 - settings over here maybe they have a
576:05 - security tab over here uh um yeah they
576:09 - got this it looks like the same thing
576:11 - more or less maybe from a Global
576:13 - Perspective it says push protection for
576:15 - yourself block commits that contains uh
576:18 - supported Secrets across all repos that
576:20 - sounds really good I'm going to turn
576:21 - that on but uh yeah just remember those
576:24 - three things the secret scanning uh did
576:27 - I say three things let's go back and
576:29 - make sure it's just those three whatever
576:31 - they were we'll go back here dependabot
576:35 - code scanning and secret scanning
576:36 - remember those three scanners
576:39 - [Music]
576:42 - okay hey this is Andrew Brown and this
576:44 - follow I want to take a look at what
576:46 - kind of permissions we have for
576:47 - organizational accounts I was trying to
576:49 - make a slide on this but I was getting
576:51 - um M mix match information maybe because
576:55 - there used to be an old way of doing it
576:56 - now there's a new way and so it was
576:58 - really confusing so this doesn't really
577:00 - work but I figured what we could do is
577:02 - just look at the organization and see
577:04 - what we have for options it didn't mess
577:06 - me up on the exam but I still think that
577:08 - we should take a look and see how um
577:11 - those kind of permissions work uh
577:14 - for uh organizations so here I'm in an
577:18 - organization we have collaborators and
577:19 - teams and notice that we can set
577:21 - different roles so we have admin
577:24 - maintain write triage and read and if we
577:27 - want to have custom roles we would have
577:29 - to have GitHub Enterprise that's the
577:32 - only way that we're going to get it so
577:34 - hopefully that is pretty darn clear I
577:36 - don't know what else to say about it
577:38 - it's pretty darn
577:39 - straightforward um but uh there could be
577:41 - a bit more but I don't know so I just
577:43 - wanted to show you that very quickly
577:46 - [Music]
577:49 - okay so within a GitHub repo we can
577:52 - manage multiple features by enabling or
577:54 - disabling them such as wikis issues
577:56 - sponsorships preserve uh the repo which
577:59 - goes into the GitHub Arctic code Vault
578:01 - discussions projects and possibly more I
578:04 - just got to point this out because it's
578:05 - in uh the section for GitHub and
578:07 - administrator and so uh for the GitHub
578:10 - foundations course and so I had to
578:11 - explicitly call out these particular
578:13 - features and there we
578:14 - [Music]
578:18 - go let's take a look at repo permission
578:21 - levels and so when you're a collaborator
578:23 - and they accept an invite you can choose
578:25 - from predefined roles with different
578:27 - levels of access the first is read which
578:29 - allows you to view and clone the repo
578:31 - open and comment on issues and pull
578:33 - requests and download releases we have
578:34 - triage which manages issues pull
578:36 - requests without WR access label and
578:40 - assign issues and P requests close and
578:42 - reopen issues emplo requests we have
578:44 - maintain this allows you to push the
578:46 - repo manage issues pull request labels
578:48 - and project boards create and publish re
578:51 - releases configure repo settings for
578:53 - non-sensitive fields we have admins
578:55 - which basically have full control and
578:57 - Enterprises allow for custom rules
579:01 - [Music]
579:04 - okay Branch protection rules are used to
579:07 - enforce certain workflows or
579:08 - requirements before changes can be
579:09 - merged into a branch you can find that
579:11 - under the uh Branch tab in your GitHub
579:13 - repo and so here we could apply a banch
579:17 - uh Branch protection rules there's a lot
579:19 - of stuff that we can do here we can
579:20 - require a poll request before merging
579:22 - require status checks to pass before
579:24 - merging require conversation uh
579:26 - resolution before merging require sign
579:29 - commits required linear history required
579:31 - deployment to succeed before merging
579:33 - lock branch do not allow bypassing the
579:35 - above settings and for admins we can
579:38 - allow Force push allow deletions on the
579:40 - exam they might ask you what kind of uh
579:44 - Branch protection rule you can do I
579:45 - don't think it's a very fair question
579:46 - because I can never remember all of
579:48 - these but
579:49 - unfortunately it might show up in your
579:51 - exam and if you don't want to lose a
579:52 - point make sure you remember generally
579:55 - what things you can do with Branch
579:56 - protection rules
579:58 - [Music]
580:02 - okay so there is a security Tab and this
580:05 - is for your repo and it basically acts
580:06 - as a security check list if you are um
580:09 - not the owner you're going to see
580:11 - something else like the actual security
580:12 - policy and some information about
580:14 - vulnerabilities in the repo but security
580:17 - policy is one thing that it will suggest
580:20 - uh for you to create which is a markdown
580:21 - fall on how security vulnerability
580:23 - should be reported we have security
580:24 - advisories which privately discusses fix
580:27 - and publishes information I think
580:29 - they're deprecating this feature um
580:31 - except for open source public repo so it
580:33 - might not be something that uh is used
580:36 - uh much in the future uh we have private
580:38 - vulnerability reporting allow your
580:39 - community to privately report potential
580:41 - security vulnerabilities to maintainers
580:42 - and repos basically a form to tell you
580:44 - about vulnerabilities I think this is in
580:46 - beta right now uh we have dependabot
580:49 - alerts so a bot that alerts you of
580:50 - vulnerabilities due to out-of-date
580:52 - dependencies dependabot can
580:54 - automatically create PRS to update
580:56 - dependencies for you to approve we have
580:58 - code scanning alerts automatically
581:00 - detect common vulnerabilities and coding
581:01 - errors via code ql and third party tools
581:05 - and then we have secret scanning Alerts
581:06 - get notified when a a secret is pushed
581:08 - to a
581:09 - [Music]
581:13 - repo collaborators allow uh you to let
581:16 - other GitHub users have access to your
581:18 - repo based on the permission levels you
581:20 - provide so you can search based on
581:22 - username across everybody it'll tell you
581:24 - whether they I actually I don't know if
581:26 - it'll tell you if they're external but
581:28 - the point is you can search for them and
581:30 - then you can add them the idea is that
581:31 - you'll get an invitation you have to
581:33 - accept the invitation um at the
581:36 - invitation address I strong recommend
581:38 - that you tell people um to go accept it
581:41 - because it's not the best at alerting uh
581:44 - other people and then sometimes it just
581:47 - times out or expires so that's kind of a
581:49 - pain so just make sure you keep on top
581:51 - of your invitations
581:53 - [Music]
581:56 - okay an organization can group uh
581:59 - organization members into teams and so
582:03 - that's an example of having a core team
582:05 - um you can set the VIS visibility
582:07 - between uh secret and visible that will
582:10 - definitely be an exam question that I
582:11 - got so make sure you remember that teams
582:14 - can be assigned to projects and issues
582:16 - uh uh request reviews from teams or
582:19 - request reviews from teams yep teams can
582:21 - be mentioned in discussions issues and
582:23 - pull requests control team access to
582:26 - repos and new members can be added to
582:28 - teams instantly giving them access to
582:30 - all relevant repos and discussions so
582:32 - the idea is that if you add people to a
582:33 - team you have uh ways of delegating out
582:37 - a bunch of um responsibilities and
582:40 - things like that so there you
582:42 - [Music]
582:46 - go GitHub connect enhances GitHub
582:49 - Enterprise servers by allowing your ghes
582:52 - instance to access some of the
582:54 - github.com cloudon offerings so the idea
582:57 - is that because you are self-hosting
582:59 - there's just functionality that lives in
583:01 - the cloud and so this is their way of
583:03 - bringing some of it to you what kind of
583:05 - functionality are we talking about well
583:07 - that is the automatic user license sync
583:09 - dependabot github.com actions which I'm
583:12 - not sure what that means but oh probably
583:14 - GitHub actions it's cuz the Dooms in
583:16 - there it's confusing server statistics
583:18 - unified search and unified contribution
583:22 - so the key thing I want to remember is
583:24 - that GitHub connect is specifically for
583:26 - the Enterprise server Edition and it's
583:29 - to uh bring certain features uh to your
583:32 - self-hosted version from the cloud
583:36 - okay
583:38 - [Music]
583:40 - so GitHub Enterprise Cloud accounts have
583:42 - a third special GitHub repo which is
583:45 - called internal and so what this
583:47 - internal GitHub repo does it allows all
583:50 - Enterprise members to have read
583:51 - permissions in the internal repo
583:53 - internal repositories are not visible to
583:55 - people outside of the Enterprise
583:56 - including outside collaborators on
583:58 - organization repos unless uh your
584:01 - Enterprise uses emus members of the
584:04 - Enterprise can Fork any internal repos
584:06 - owned by an organization in the
584:08 - Enterprise and internal repos are the
584:10 - default setting for all new repositories
584:12 - created in an organiz organization owned
584:15 - by an Enterprise account so all I want
584:17 - you to know is that there is these
584:19 - things called internal repos they're
584:20 - only for Enterprise Cloud are they on
584:23 - the server one I don't think so but in
584:25 - the docs they said it was for cloud and
584:27 - then when I looked up a different
584:28 - feature in Enterprise it said it was
584:30 - only for cloud but was for both so um
584:33 - yeah I would just say remember that
584:35 - there's just third option for Enterprise
584:37 - or Enterprise cloud and you'll be in
584:39 - good shape and get another point on your
584:40 - exam
584:42 - [Music]
584:46 - okay so GitHub makes extra security
584:48 - features available to customers under a
584:50 - GitHub Advanced security license and
584:54 - these GitHub Advanced security is
584:55 - available for Enterprise accounts on
584:57 - GitHub Enterprise Cloud GI GitHub
584:59 - Enterprise servers and some of the
585:01 - features are available for public
585:04 - repositories on GitHub I'm not sure I
585:05 - have of four in there I guess it's just
585:07 - a little muck up there so that doesn't
585:09 - make a whole lot of sense I can barely
585:10 - get to my pen tool um but anyway uh the
585:15 - features that they're talking about is
585:17 - code scanning secret scanning dependency
585:19 - review and So based on uh whether you're
585:22 - a public repo or you're a private repo
585:24 - without advanced
585:26 - security you're going to have different
585:28 - access so for public repos you get full
585:30 - access for private repos without the
585:32 - advanced security license you get
585:34 - nothing and if you have the advanced
585:35 - security you get them all what's
585:37 - confusing about uh this one in
585:39 - particular is um it says some of the
585:41 - features for public repost so it makes
585:43 - me think there's more than three
585:44 - features I could not find more other
585:47 - than the three listed uh maybe if I made
585:49 - an Enterprise account and contacted
585:51 - support that I could figure that out but
585:55 - um that is a lot of work especially for
585:56 - a foundation's course so just know that
585:59 - there is a GitHub GitHub Advance
586:01 - security license and remember those
586:03 - three components and those are the same
586:04 - things that we basically kind of saw in
586:06 - the um in the uh uh the security tab
586:11 - right with all the scans and dependency
586:13 - review I'm going to assume is dependabot
586:16 - okay uh but there you
586:18 - [Music]
586:22 - go let's quickly talk about saml and Sim
586:26 - these are both available for GitHub
586:27 - Enterprise cloud and GitHub Enterprise
586:30 - server um just remember that these are
586:32 - features specifically to Enterprise and
586:35 - just have a general understanding the
586:36 - difference between the to so saml stands
586:38 - for security assertion marketable
586:40 - language it is an open standard for
586:43 - exchanging authentication authorization
586:44 - between an identity provider and a
586:46 - service provider it's an important use
586:48 - case for saml is single sign on Via the
586:50 - browser if you don't know what single
586:51 - sign on is it's where you use one
586:53 - account to log in and then you're logged
586:55 - in everywhere else and so if you want to
586:57 - have single sign on the mechanism
586:59 - they're using here is saml then you have
587:02 - SIM so this is stands for system of
587:05 - cross domain identity management it's an
587:07 - open standard for automating the
587:08 - exchange of user identity information
587:11 - across different identity management
587:12 - systems a key use for SCM is to enable
587:16 - scalable and automated user provisioning
587:18 - and de-provisioning often integrated
587:19 - with Enterprise identity
587:21 - Services I know that's a mouthful but I
587:23 - got a simpler summary for you here samle
587:25 - is about securely transmitting user
587:27 - authentication and authorization data
587:29 - for single signon purposes and Sim is
587:33 - about managing user identities across
587:35 - different systems to simplify account
587:37 - maintenance provisioning so if you
587:38 - remember those two at the bottom you'll
587:40 - know what they are um they didn't really
587:42 - ask at least I didn't get any questions
587:43 - that had to distinguish between the two
587:45 - it was more so you know where are these
587:47 - features available and it was for both
587:48 - the Enterprise cloud and Enterprise
587:51 - server um and one other thing I want to
587:54 - just note is that these two uh these two
587:57 - things can complement each other in the
587:59 - same ecosystem because they're doing two
588:01 - different things um serving two
588:03 - different purposes so just understand
588:05 - that they Co co-mingle um and this is
588:08 - for Enterprises
588:10 - [Music]
588:13 - okay hey this is Angie Brown and this
588:15 - follow along I want to show you how to
588:18 - register um or book your uh GitHub
588:20 - certification exam so what you're going
588:23 - to want to do is go to the GitHub
588:24 - certifications page and you can do that
588:27 - by typing in
588:28 - G.I certifications and it should bring
588:31 - you uh generally here I've never done
588:33 - this booking before so we're going to
588:35 - learn together but it should wouldn't be
588:37 - too hard and the first thing we'll want
588:38 - to do is register I want to point out
588:41 - that if we go down below we can see our
588:43 - certifications and get additional
588:45 - information but I'm going to go ahead
588:46 - and register here and I actually already
588:49 - have registered and the process is
588:50 - connecting your GitHub account um to
588:54 - here so my steps might be slightly
588:55 - different but more or less it's the same
588:57 - so you might have a page where it's
588:59 - going to pop up it's going to show you
589:01 - that you have to confirm um a connection
589:03 - and go ahead and do that and you should
589:05 - end up in here and so so here is where
589:08 - we're going to see um uh our exams and
589:12 - so we have GitHub actions GitHub
589:14 - administrator advaned security and
589:15 - Foundations I'm interested in the
589:17 - foundations one so I'm going to go ahead
589:19 - and click into that and just understand
589:20 - that this price may change based on um
589:24 - you know based on uh if they change the
589:27 - price down the road but right now it's
589:28 - price is 99 USD because there this exam
589:32 - is so new at the time I'm shooting this
589:33 - video it actually has a discount of $49
589:36 - so you might not get that um it might
589:38 - just be $999 USD which is still very
589:40 - affordable but just understand that uh
589:42 - you know different times means different
589:43 - results let's go ahead and schedule this
589:45 - exam it's through PSI so if you've ever
589:48 - done the PSI exam that'll be pretty
589:49 - straightforward so we'll go ahead and
589:50 - schedule and take our exam and we have
589:52 - information to fill out so what I'm
589:54 - going to do is I'm going to go through
589:55 - all of this and fill up my information
589:57 - and click this button and then I'll show
589:59 - you the next steps I just don't want to
590:00 - expose of the information so I'll see
590:02 - you back here in just a moment
590:04 - okay all right so I click through there
590:06 - and and now it's going to want me to um
590:08 - accept the uh PSI test taker site to my
590:11 - GitHub account I'm going to go ahead and
590:12 - authorize this I'm just going to stop
590:14 - and start again just because I'm not
590:15 - sure if it's going to show personal
590:16 - information I don't really feel like uh
590:19 - um admitting it so I'm just trying to do
590:20 - that so I'll be back here in just a
590:21 - moment I'm going to head go ahead and
590:22 - click that green button there we go and
590:24 - it's brought us over to the PSI online
590:27 - store so this is a familiar experience
590:29 - at least for me let's go take a look at
590:31 - and see the uh available tests um you
590:34 - know sometimes there are tests that are
590:35 - online or are on site these days
590:38 - everything is both uh right right now I
590:41 - cannot take these ones I'm not exactly
590:42 - sure as to why as I'm pretty sure the
590:45 - other ones did not have prerequisites
590:47 - but maybe GitHub changed it and you need
590:49 - to have the foundations before you take
590:50 - these ones that's totally fine I'm just
590:52 - click into this and see why that is the
590:54 - test requires author from the test
590:56 - sponsor so maybe since it's so new at
590:58 - this time it's not going to allow me to
591:00 - do this or it could be that it is a
591:02 - prerequisite there but what we'll do is
591:04 - go back here and click on the
591:05 - foundations and notice that we have 99
591:08 - USD I'm going to go ahead and continue
591:10 - booking actually going to click back
591:12 - there because I think there was a deal
591:14 - you're pre-approved uh you're eligible
591:16 - for this exam until
591:18 - 31224 not exactly sure why I chose that
591:20 - message that's totally fine so we have
591:21 - online proctored and on site I'm going
591:23 - to go ahead and go to continue booking
591:26 - um we have some information here uh
591:28 - please don't call me it doesn't go to me
591:30 - uh just annoying okay so do not call my
591:33 - phone number we'll go ahead and hit
591:34 - continue I might even go WR that out so
591:37 - it's less of an issue for me I'm going
591:38 - to go ahead
591:39 - and type in Canada I am in Toronto time
591:45 - so going go ahead and type in Toronto
591:46 - that's uh Us East uh standard um and
591:50 - we'll go ahead and hit find and so now
591:52 - I'm looking for an available time that I
591:54 - wish to book um so I mean I could book
591:57 - it today that seems a bit
592:00 - crazy um do I want to do that am I crazy
592:04 - enough to do that today um
592:07 - maybe yeah you know what I think I'm
592:09 - going to do it I'm going to book my um
592:13 - uh mine tonight for 900 p.m. I know that
592:16 - sounds really crazy but I'm going to do
592:18 - it we'll go ahead and choose 9:00 p.m.
592:20 - make sure your time is correct you're
592:22 - going to have an issue there I'm going
592:23 - to book this time slot and now I need to
592:26 - fill in my additional information I just
592:28 - happen to have a velure code here I'm
592:30 - just understand that you know you may or
592:32 - may not have it but I just happen to
592:34 - have it because I'm lucky we're going to
592:36 - go ahead and fill in the arrest of
592:37 - information continue on if the review
592:40 - information has personal information I
592:41 - might not show it um but uh we're almost
592:44 - there so I'll be back in just a moment I
592:47 - just want to quickly show that you have
592:48 - two options credit card and PayPal so
592:50 - I'm going to go ahead and enter my
592:51 - credit card in I'm just going to go
592:52 - ahead and do that I'll see you back in a
592:53 - moment all right so yeah here is my
592:55 - confirmation I'm going to go ahead and
592:57 - purchase this so it looks to be good
592:59 - make sure you confirm the time and make
593:02 - note of the time that you have to
593:03 - complete it as that is very important um
593:06 - again to today is February 1st where I
593:07 - am so that is the correct date I'm going
593:09 - to go ahead and click
593:15 - purchase and now my uh booking is
593:18 - confirmed it's probably a great idea to
593:20 - print your confirmation a lot of times
593:22 - you have to prep your environment so
593:24 - make sure you uh set up your remote
593:25 - online Proctor uh system and do your
593:27 - checks prior to this so if you click
593:30 - that it should install an app on your
593:31 - computer um really make sure you do that
593:34 - ahead of time with these exams you
593:35 - should always have two pieces of
593:37 - government IDs so think passport and
593:40 - driver's license the reason I just tell
593:42 - you to have both of them is in case one
593:43 - is giving you a problem um so just make
593:46 - sure you have both on hand you really
593:47 - only need one but if you go to an
593:49 - inperson uh place they might want to
593:51 - have two pieces of government ID maybe
593:53 - one that's uh you know sometimes it can
593:56 - be health card but mostly it's driver's
593:57 - license passport um it's going to vary
594:00 - per country but uh yeah uh give me good
594:03 - luck on my exam and I'll talk to you
594:05 - soon out

Cleaned transcript:

hey this is angrew brown over here at exam Pro bringing you another complete study course and this time it's the GitHub foundations certification this one's all about GitHub and practicing some of your git skills and this is a great certification if you're looking to show your developer skills in the cloud or Tech the way we're going to help you get the certification as always is the lecture content doing HandsOn labs and giving you that free practice exam so you can go as that exam get that certification and put it on your resume I want to point out if you love these kinds of courses the best way to support more free study courses is to buy the paid additional materials that is optional but you'll get uh things like cheat sheets U more pratice exams and other things like that so I just want to tell you that I've taught a lot of different kinds of certifications in cloud and in Tech you name it I've taught it we got adab us Azure gcp terraform kubernetes and more more and obviously now GitHub and if you're wondering why I'm in a snowsuit it's because my office it's really cold it's like7 so this is how it has to be but I will see you in class in two seconds ciao hey this is angrew Brown from exam Pro and we're at the start of our journey asking the most important question first which is what is the GitHub Foundation certification well it is an entrylevel GitHub certification teaching you Git Version Control Basics working with GitHub repos collaboration features modern development project management uh GitHub privacy Security Administration GitHub community and open source now I put in Git Version Control Basics but uh they don't really required in the uh certification itself but you will implicitly learn them as you work through uh this course The Unofficial course code uh for the certification is ghf because there are no course codes uh that GitHub has published so I've used the um small initial initializations that they use on their um certification page GitHub is the leading uh Version Control service in the world it's one of the most common ways for developers to Showcase their code uh if you go for developer interviews a lot of times people want to have your GitHub link so they can see your activity um and your code so who's the certification for well consider this certification if you are new to Cloud programming and need to learn Version Control fundamentals um more like Version Control workflows online I I would be better to say uh you're a nondeveloper uh at Tech role so you are in Tech but you're just a nondeveloper looking to quickly add developer skills uh you want to be effective uh collaborating on code bases with other developers this GitHub certification will not test your git skills it's focused on GitHub you will use git but you may have serious gaps in git knowledge um to be used in a uh work or production environment so make sure you polyfill that information where you can um in terms of the road map they have four certifications the foundation the advanced security the actions the admin and this is where I would put them in terms of difficulty they don't um categorize them into levels but uh you level 100 I would say the foundations is is very easy um the advanced security I put it at 150 because it looks like an extension of the foundations focusing on the security features actions is very technical so a level 200 makes sense an admin is I wouldn't say hard but it goes into Enterprise so it's harder to get access to the Enterprise account and test it out and you have to understand Enterprise Concepts so I put it the level 300 uh there's a lot of different routes you could take you could go from the level 100 uh or sorry the get foundations to Advance Security to the admin or the foundations to the actions to me the advanced security seems like such little effort to do that it seems like a good followup or something you should do at the same time uh if the content's available to to um study when doing GI GitHub foundations uh if you're looking for particular roles you could probably say the cloud security engineer is where you'd go for the advanced security so You' start with the foundations for all of them go there if you want to be a cloud developer GitHub actions is super useful because it's a cicd pipeline and it's becoming one of the most popular cicd pipelines out there if you're an Enterprise engineer then the administrator is good for having that Enterprise knowledge if somebody wants to run GitHub uh there but you know these are just titles you're not going to actually have that role from completing these certifications it's just part of uh content for those particular roles um get up certifications do not validate programming technical diagramming code management other technical skills that are required for obtaining technical roles so just understand the limitations of these certifications they are useful for learning but understand that uh it it stops at a certain place okay how long should you take to pass if if you're a beginner uh and you've never used GitHub before and you've never used git or written code before and you're new to to Cloud in Tech maybe 20 hours um there is no uh historical information about this certification because it's brand new and I'm the first one with a study course out so we'll say 20 hours is a sufficient amount of time uh for experienced folks um if you have practical knowledge working with GitHub if you have technical knowledge working with Git uh you have strong background in technology worked in a technical developer role it's going to be 4 hours if you're an if you're in a technical role but just not a developer you might be more in the middle um and so I would probably say 14 hours of average study time 50% lecture 50% Labs uh or sorry 50% lecture in labs and then 50% practice exams that's usually always the same thing I always say and one to two hours a day for 14 days if it's 14 hours you can do an hour a day and you'll be in really really good shape what does it take to pass the exam watch the video lecture and memorize key information this exam in particular is very fact toal and unfairly so so make sure where I call out fact toal information to memorize it because it is silly and you'll lose points for that do the HandsOn Labs it's going to really help cement how all this stuff works together and even though the exams don't really require it I I want you to have that knowledge and I want you to have an easier time passing so please do the follow follow alongs do paid online practice exams because this one in particular again it's very fact toal and you need to see some variations so you don't get caught off guard if you think that you go through my course and go I'm really good at GitHub now uh you'll be thrown a bunch of Enterprise questions and stuff that you didn't think that would be there and in particular what information's there so make sure you utilize practice exams make sure you utilize my free practice exam which will come out with this um and you'll do fine again not a hard exam but you know I don't want you to be frustrated on that exam losing out some particular points because you didn't know that you had to know the uh uh the lineup of GitHub work uh workflow actions inside of uh GitHub projects or something like that there are seven domains for this certification and I need to point out that for some reason GitHub uh does not share the waiting of each domain most exams do that and my experience when I sat the exam it was kind of imbalance where I had a lot of Enterprise questions so just understand that you might not even see a question in the domain that you are expecting or you might have very few a lot in other areas I don't know why they did this it was a bad choice but that's what they did we have seven domains we have support uh GitHub Enterprise for users and key stakeholders uh domain two manage user identities and GitHub authentication uh domain three describe how GitHub is deployed distributed and licens domain four manage access and permissions based on membership domain five ensure or sorry enable secure software development and ensur compliance domain six manage GitHub actions domain seven benefit of benefits of the GitHub Community there's no development stuff in here but I've crammed in the exam development stuff because you really should know development stuff and GitHub is a developer platform for some reason they decided not to include it in here but I feel that it really makes it easier to utilize GitHub if you know the developer tools uh where do you take this exam at an inperson test center or online from the convenience of your own home GitHub delivers it with PSI um so PSI has an online version and then they have a a bunch of test networks that they partnered with um it is a it it is a proctored exam so there's somebody that's supposedly watching your exam so that you do not cheat I just want to warn you PSI is not known for having a good test experience when I saw at my exam um uh I was 30 minutes early checked in and uh I waited 40 minutes after my checkin time because it said it was connecting me to a special specialist it never did I had to contact support they uh they made me uh fill in a bunch of information which seemed weird because they should know who I am already cuz I'm in their app and then they told me oh I'm not actually connected to anybody and so the app lies to you so don't get stressed out if you have technical issues with PSI it's extremely common and uh if you're doing it online if you can do a test center I strongly recommend doing so because it just makes the whole experience a lot less stressful from the environment perspective from uh the technology perspective but if you got to do online just uh don't stress out and understand that everybody has these issues uh doesn't make sense but everyone has these issues and not to not to to sweat it or throw you off before your exam starts in terms of grading they don't give us a grade GitHub does not provide a passing score we don't know how many points there are we do know how many questions there are but uh for some reason they've decided not to provide that information uh they say in their FAQ because they can't exactly calculate it they don't want to give you an inaccurate number it really makes no sense but I'm going to tell you that you still will pass pass this exam it's not that hard but yeah you just have to make sure that you can get get as many points on those fact total questions and don't stress out about not knowing what your passing score is there are 75 questions in this exam 60 scored 15 unscored so you can afford to get 15 questions wrong at least there is no penalty for wrong questions at least as far as I'm aware of and I saw U both multiple choice and multiple answer uh sometimes it was choose two choose three it was never more than three there wasn't that many multiple answer uh like basically multiple select ones so it wasn't that bad don't stress out about the unscored questions because there's 15 of them they don't count towards your exam why is there unscored questions uh they're used to evaluate the introduction of new questions to determine if the exam is too easy and the passing score or question difficulty needs to be increased to discover users who are attempting to cheat the exam or still dump exam questions if you encounter questions you've never studied for that seem really hard keep your cool and remember they may be unscored questions the duration of this exam is 2 hours so you get 1.6 minutes per question so that exam time in minutes is 120 Minutes your C time is uh 30 minutes or sorry 150 minutes because you add 30 minutes there when I say see time that's the time you need to go in and check in and re review the instructions and get your workspace set up and sign the NDA and show them your space um provide feedback at exam uh I was able to check in 30 minutes online prior you you probably want to be 45 minutes prior to your exam okay so give yourself a few minutes to get set up and try to check in early sometimes they let you start exams early right so even if you're scheduled for 5 uh sometimes 5 minutes after your checkin you can start and get rolling on it but uh yeah there you go and we'll see you in the next one ciao hey everyone it's Andrew Brown in this uh video I want to show you uh where you can get uh the exam guide and other additional information so you can understand where I'm getting this stuff and make sense of it yourself and you might hear my space space heater here I have the tiny space heater to keep my feet warm my hands warm so sorry if the background noise picks up but let's go take a look so the way you can get to this is you just type in G.I certifications love the short link by the way and I mean they have stuff down here below but what you really got to do is go to register and then connect your account and it'll do something with GitHub and then you'll see this stuff here okay now I want to point out that um they have an FAQ down below uh I guess they have a candidate handbook which is something I don't even sure if I open that up this is more about like how to run stuff yeah okay not really useful but um what we're looking for is the exam guides okay so if we were to go into the foundations which is this is the certification we're focused on you can see the price here it says you pass with the exam of 82% hooray I actually can see my score now I didn't know where that was you can't see it I'm trying to move my head here not sure why uh it's not letting me do that there we go and so I actually got an 82% which is pretty good considering I thought I flubbed a bunch of questions but that's pretty good remember there is no study course or practice exams before I took this um so that's great but they really should tell us the the nonp passing score so if we go down H to FAQ okay and we look up passing score since there are multiple versions of the certification exam the passing score can have minor variances depending on which version you take to ensure the Integrity of exams to avoid confusion on why there is a small variance will not provide you a specific total score and I mean I think that's kind of a failure of uh any kind of certification program I think that would be very frustrating for the person taking the exam not knowing what the score is but again again I passed it so I'm just telling you like you will pass it but understand that they're just not going to tell you what it is at least not at this time so that's one thing that I found uh stood out there but let's go back over to here and we have the learning path which is on Microsoft learn they might have some content that um that gets covered a little bit differently here I found it not to be uh very good but there was some stuff about like Enterprise um that I don't really go much more into detail where they're talking about like bringing identities it might be this right so again I didn't I didn't look at this until afterwards so yeah I don't really go this full top into this um I do like UFA but um you know you might want to top off in that one section here but the rest I don't know about the rest like in terms of quality it's it's not uh it's not there um so let's go into the study guide and we'll just open that up okay and we have our domains so we have our seven domains and if we go and scroll on down we can see they have git and GitHub Basics so they have like a little bit about expect you know about git like commit and branching um I made sure to include other things like what is remote uh I don't know I have a big list of it it's in the uh we have a uh a git and GitHub quick and dirty crash course to get you through all that stuff we have uh GitHub ident identities so understanding the different types of accounts GitHub markdown what's unusual is like they talk about GitHub markdown but they don't talk about GitHub flavored markdown really odd they have a markdown section but not that GitHub flavored markdown Is Amazing by the way you have GitHub desktop you have GitHub mobile um coming down here all about how to work with GitHub repos um how to work with issues how to work with pull requests how to work with discussions how to work with notifications I don't I even got a question on notifications on my exam uh gists wikis and GitHub Pages nothing on GitHub Pages surprised it didn't promote that a bit more I really like GitHub Pages we have GitHub actions um in this for GitHub actions you know you need to know a little bit about the syntax of the file because I was getting very specific questions about that um copilot so we have copilot we have code spaces I actually was surprised how little there was on codes spaces but I do do a very thorough CH job of covering codes spaces with us because we need to you utilize it to be effective and so we get a lot more knowledge in that than expected we have uh GitHub projects um it's weird because they say GitHub projects but it's really project management so like labels and Milestones aren't specific to GitHub projects so I kind of broke that up into a different area there and there was some other things that were Project Specific that um um that I uh that I had to put in here and things that I didn't what's weird about GitHub projects is they need they want you to know very specific things like they want you to know um the types of builtin workflows right the types of of charts and that kind of threw me off because they seem so trivial to know but they asked you in the exam so I was surprised this thing is not specific to GitHub projects I'm not sure why they put it in there um but anyway and this this as well so I'm not sure why these are in here or even create template repos these all these here shouldn't be in this section but they are uh we have privacy priv privacy Security Administration so we have a few here uh for uh security then we have GitHub admin rtion I might call it administrator I'm not sure why but I might messed that up this is supposed to be about like the management of your repo I actually covered a lot of it in the GitHub repo section so I end up repeating the content a little bit we have the benefits of the GitHub community so knowing what sponsors is what is open source what is github's relationship with open source um inner source and there you go so yeah I would say that again it's not a hard exam um and I really make sure that you're super prepared for it just make sure you do do uh uh some practice exams just so you don't get caught off and lose some points on that factal information but there you go okay hey this is Andrew Brown I'm just going to do one ask of you if you can uh if you if you like this course and it helped you out they have this program called GitHub stars and they basically recognize people that did good work uh uh promoting GitHub or educating and communities I think I'm doing that because I'm making a free course and if you want to do me a favor you can go get here to the nominate up at stars. github.com you can say I nominate and it would be like Omen King because it would be something about the actual uh you know like I taught you GitHub and you thought that was really great and I really great greatly appreciate that and you know maybe that way I will go make more of GitHub content and we can help the community more so there you go hey this is angrew brown and we are taking a look at Version Control Systems which are designed to track changes or revisions to code and there's been a lot of software over the years that helped us do that we had CVS aers mercal and get so back uh in 1990s when we got CVS though even though we had it I don't think a lot of companies were using it it took some time to adopt if you ever heard of like Doom or Wolfenstein you'd be uh interested to learn they didn't use Version Control Systems and what they would do is they would literally copy files onto floppies and hope that they don't lose their files but of course AV Version Control Systems makes it really easy to not worry about losing floppies or CDs or drives because they keep track of all the history then came subversion in 2000 but the real game Cher was in 2005 when we were introduced to a new type A version control system and we had Mercurial and get um but the key difference between the old ones and the new ones was the old ones were centralized and the new ones were decentralized and these decentralized ones became very popular for very specific reason reasons they had full local history and complete control of the repo locally they were straightforward and efficient for branching and merging which was a really big deal uh better performance improve fall tolerance flexible workflows work fully offline um and out of the two git was the one that won and there are reasons for that we'll talk about that when we look at version control services um but uh yeah git is the one that everybody is using today and that's why we are taking this course I just want to point out they're going to come across a lot of terms that sound like trees tree trunk branches um the reason for this is that Version Control represents um the revisions or changes in a graphlike structure you can even say a dag um if you're familiar with that and so uh you know you'll see these terms and we're not talking about real trees we're talking about uh the components of a verion control so there you go hey this is Angie Brown and we are taking a look at git so git is a distributed Version Control System a dvcs that's going to be hard to remember uh and it's created by lonus torold if you've ever seen that name before you might know that lonus is the creator of the Linux kernel but he is also the creator of git and git right now resides with the Linux Foundation which I believe is a nonprofit set up by Linus as well or has some a part to do with it where a lot of Open Source projects reside um but you know I don't really want to focus on that I want to focus on the practicalities of git so the idea with Git is that each change of your code a git commit can be captured and tracked through the history of your project a git tree so I'm going to get my pen tool out here for just a second and so I just want to make this very clear so we have over here a file and a get commit can or a commit can be made up of multiple files with multiple changes in them and then they're represented over with a a a message okay so here this is a single um git commit and it can have multiple files and uh files and changes in that single one and then that's your tree okay so hopefully that is clear if it's not don't worry we'll get HandsOn skills and we'll definitely be able to remember them later I want to take a look at a bunch of common get terms um and it doesn't matter if you remember these now but you will know what they are hopefully by the end of this course um and so there is this nice graphic here that is provided by Wikipedia that gives an idea of how all of these terms uh work together uh but let's go quickly through them and see what we can make sense of so the first term is a repository this represents the logical container holding the codebase in fact you you could interchange the word codebase repository and mostly mean the same thing we have a Commit This represents a change of data in the local repository and so um that's pretty clear then we have the tree this represents the entire history of a of a repo so when you see tree just think of that graph we have remote uh this is a version of your project hosted elsewhere used for exchanging commits uh some people might be a bit uh picky about this because they might say remote is actually a remote reference to a repository so it's pointing it's a pointer but I'm just going to make it think that it's a remote uh repo it's just somewhere else and there uh there are branches so these are Divergent path to development allowing isolate Chang you're absolutely going to know what branches are you're absolutely going to have to work with them quite a bit um there is a branch known as Maine it was formerly known as Master uh the word was changed because it was not a popular term anymore and so now main is the new name uh and this is usually the default Branch or the base Branch uh if that makes sense there too so we have clone this creates a complete local copy of a repository including its history so this will create like a littleg folder um so it's not just the contents of the files but some configuration around the git repo we have checkouts so this switches between different branches or commits in your repo we have pull so this downloads changes from a remote repository merges them into your branch we have push this uploads your local repository changes to a remote repository we have fetch this downloads data from a remote repo without integrating it into your work um we have reset so undoes local changes without options to unstage revert commits we have merge this combines multiple commit histories into one we have staging files this prepares and organizes uh changes for commits it's not a command but like it's just where you would work with your files um in the uh example here I'm just going to get my pen tool out again it's kind of over here it has to relate with this up here as well and So within staging files we're going to have commits which we already talked about prior and then there's that add command so adding things that will get committed so hopefully that makes sense and we'll see you in the next one okay hey this is SRE Brown and we are taking a look at version control services and if you're thinking that we already covered this it looks that way but the other one was Version Control Systems this one is version control services and yes they have the same initialism which is confusing but it's very important to make that distinction because those are two separate things so version control services are fully managed services that host your version controlled repositories these Services often have additional functionality going Beyond just being a remote host for your repos git is the most popular and often the only choice for a VCS and we often call these get only uh providers get providers um I need to also point out that some people call version control services Version Control Systems and vice versa and it just gets really confusing so I did did my best to make that clear distinction between the two okay let's take a look at some vcs's so the first here is GitHub and it's owned by Microsoft it's the most popular VCS uh due to offering uh due to its ease of use offering and being around the longest at least forgit um and they've always been very developer focused and super friendly uh GitHub is primarily where open source projects are hosted and offer Rich functionalities such as issue tracking automation pipelines and a host of other features I remember the day GitHub came out and I signed up for it because I was so done with using subversion then came along gitlab so gitlab was an emerging competitor to GitHub and at the time had unique features such as cicd Pipeline and improve security measures this is no longer the case as GitHub is now on par with gitlab um but yeah at one point a lot of people were looking at gitlab then there's bit bucket this one is owned by at laian you might have heard of laian before because they are are uh the same company that makes jira and jira is the most commonly used project manager uh for um people in Tech so you know even though GitHub is really great for developers a lot of companies still use bitbucket and the interesting thing about bitbucket was that they originally hosted Mercurial so remember I said back in 2005 mercal and get came out well alatan adopted mercal GitHub adopted um git and git one and GitHub one and so what's really interesting is that bitbucket then eventually added git and then sunsetted mercal so everything basically is get now there is another provider called sourceforge they're one of the oldest places to host your source code they existed before GitHub um and they were the first uh to provide free of charge um uh get repository hosting to open source projects um the only thing about Source Forge is that they never really dominated because they just had so many ads and bad practices and so it just didn't work out for them they are still around and a lot of Open Source projects like to only host there they might mirror make a copy to other providers like GitHub um but for the most part everybody's on GitHub um but there you go hey this is Andrew Brown we are taking a look at GitHub and this is a version controlled service that initially offered hosted manag remote get repos and is expanded to provide other offerings around hosted code bases if you go look up what GitHub calls themselves today they call themselves like an AI uh developer powered platform um it's really bizarre because they are basically a host for uh for get repos with extra stuff on top of it but I guess since AI is so popular they got to try right but let's take a look at all the functionality that they have so we have get repository hosting that is their main bread and butter we have project management tools issue tracking PLL requests and code reviews GitHub pages and wikis GitHub actions GitHub copilot GitHub code spaces GitHub Marketplace GitHub gists GitHub discussions collaboration features for organization organizations and teams API access development so GitHub development they have a GitHub CLI they have sdks um we have security features autod detecting credentials in repos they have education specific things or course automation like GitHub classroom and I'm sure they have more uh we're going to learn about all of these things because this is what the GitHub course is about to understand the full offering of GitHub and to make best use of it and just a fun fact is that GitHub was originally built in Ruby on Rails Ruby is my favorite language rails is my favorite framework so I've been uh uh on the the ride or the train since day one with GitHub um so I know it pretty well but let's jump into it okay hey everyone this is angrew brown and this fall along I want to show you how to set up UFA or multiactor authentication we'll talk about it later in the course but it's very important that we get this set up early uh so we get it out of the way and that's our opportunity to also install a really useful application called GitHub mobile so I'm going to go into Google and just type in GitHub mobile so we can take a look and so what GitHub mobile is it's an application that allows you to U basically interact with um uh GitHub on your phone but the major reason why I want you to install it is because it's also used as a uh authentication tool for GitHub now you can use another tool if you already have Google Authenticator Microsoft authenticator aie you can use what you want to use and you can actually add both of them there but I find the easiest way to um do UFA is to use G uh GitHub mobile mobile so I really do recommend that you install it's for both Google Play and your Apple phones I'm on screen for a second sorry for the uh the upward camera I'm in standing desk mode right now but the idea is that you're looking for the app it's literally just called I if you can see it GitHub right so you want to install that application okay so here it's showing my profile as I'm logged in here and this will be what we use to log in or confirm when we log in the future so what I'm going to do is go up here I'm going to turn off the video so I don't have to look at my self and we're going to go over to um settings I would think and then from here it' probably be under passwords and authentication and so if we scroll on down um I mean there is a passwordless way of logging I have yet to use that but what we're looking at is the two Factor authentication I'm going to go ahead and enable that now what's interesting is that if you have a lot of um open source contributions you have to have UFA turned on so in my account they turned it on for me they said I couldn't use my GitHub account unless they turned it on but we have this QR code so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to take a quick look here um I mean this is one way of doing it I guess we could do text message as well let's go back here because I thought if you had the GitHub mobile application it would showed here but since we have nothing attached we'll have to attach something so I'm going to go here I'm just going to carefully look here and um you know what I'm going to do s no I'm going to stick with the authenticator so I already have aie installed um so I'm going to use that I really like aie it's by twilio and I find it is one of the most light ways of um getting a multiactor authentication so I'm just going to show you what it looks like again on my phone but I really want to use GitHub mobile but I'm really surprised that they don't show that in the setup but yeah so for example this is uh aie it's really simple you put in a pin and then you can get into your actual codes uh that rotate out um so you can go install that it's in the Google Play Store and the iOS Apple Store but um I guess I'll add that so what I'm going to do is scan this QR code with my phone and all phones can scan QR codes you just open your photo app and hover over and it'll pick it up you'll get a link and you'll click through and then it'll ask you what app you want to open with and so I already have ai installed so I'm going to click aie if you want to see this again I'm trying to show as much as I can on my phone but it's asking me what app do I want to open with aie after scanning that code right and I'll say uh this time yes and then uh I have a pin so I'm have to enter my pin in okay and ay opened but it didn't automatically add it so what I'm going to have to do in aie I'll just show you this for a second because I thought it would add it but it didn't so I'm going have to say add account at the top there's a little drop down for for that okay so now it's asking me to scan the QR code so I'm going to do that okay and so it's Brad it in here and so now I have it here it says GitHub and then my username I'm going to hit save and so now I have a code and so that's the code I need to enter in all right so I'll just turn off my screen and enter the code in as quick as I can 705 839 really doesn't matter if I tell you this code out loud and now we have our backup codes you should never share your backup codes with anybody this is a way that people can get into your account um I really did not mean to show them to you here I'll have to do some editing to um hide them okay so I've downloaded my codes and make sure you print out these codes and you put them somewhere safe and have it offline do not have it online that's the whole point so go get the special duang you have permission to go buy some uh stationary and put that in and put it somewhere safe okay so I have mine downloaded to my computer and I'll go print it out later and what we'll do is we'll go ahead and say I have saved my recovery codes and so now it shows GitHub mobile this is so silly the GitHub mobile app on your phone can be used as UFA enable it by installing the GitHub mobile app so maybe the reason it didn't work was because I didn't sign into it so if I had signed into it initially maybe we didn't have to do this to begin with so what I'm going to do is just go hit done and I still think again it's easier to use the GitHub mobile app so I'm going to go and see if I can log out of GitHub mobile and log into this other account or maybe I can be logged into both of them at the same time so I'm opening up GitHub here and I'm just seeing if I can be logged into multiples so what I've noticed here I'm logged in already I just want to show you something so here I am in GitHub mobile and there's a little Cog at the top so I'm going to click that Cog and then I have my settings right and I'm going to scroll on down and there's I think that says accounts I know I'm sorry about the glare so there's accounts I'm going to click accounts and it looks like that I can add multiple accounts and that's what I'm going to do okay so I'm going to go ahead and hit add account and it's going to ask me to sign in with GitHub okay so I'm going hit the big white blob of a button and then it's going to show this here sign in with different account so I'm going to go ahead and use a different account and I'm have to enter my uh username email and password so just give me a moment okay all right so I had to like email myself my password because my my Dash Lan wasn't letting me log in but once you're there you're going to see the that authentication code that it's going to want so I'm going to go grab that from aie and it's good to have ay installed I like having it uh because you can't use GitHub authenticator for everything so I'm going to go real real quick and put that code in nope I missed it so I'm going to have to try that again sometimes you miss it you'll have to try it twice okay there we go it's going to ask uh to get access to authorize It Go Down Below say authorize GitHub that green button there and it's signing me in and it looks like I'm now in so I'm now in here with my account I imagine I can switch between the two what I'm going to do is just turn off my screen here and let's take a look and see if this is showing up now so we'll give this a refresh and there it is so it's now configured so the idea here is that you can also set the default so again I would recommend GitHub mobile doesn't hurt to have more than one but I find this to be super convenient because um it like when you go through this you only have to enter in like two letters it's a lot faster it'll it'll it'll jump up on your screen whereas these other authenticators will not not um so that's my recommendation to you there and now that we have two Factor we are in great shape I'm going to just go back to Home by clicking the octocat and uh that's it so I'll see you in the next one okay ciao hey this is angre brown and in this fall along I want to show you how to create your own GitHub account every single developer on the planet should have a GitHub account because it's a great way to Showcase your work uh we'll talk about that later but you can see that I'm already logged in here so I already have a GitHub account and what I'm going to do is log out and I'm going to create a new one from scratch so here we can see uh we can have multiple ones um I'm going to just sign out of all of my accounts here and let's go ahead and create ourselves a new one so I'm not sure remember I told earlier I told you they're like the leading AI power developer platform which is such a silly term but um let's go ahead and see if we can make a new one so just in case it's a future and they've changed this homepage I'm going to go up to sign up and and I'm going to see if I can make an account if I can find an email that has not been used so far so I'm going to type and your exam prod. so if you're using Gmail so I can't use that one if you're using Gmail you can use like plus signs to um create multiple ones so like my really really personal email don't email me because I don't ever check this one it's like Omen King gmail.com you'll learn that my username on GitHub is Omen King why is that I don't want to talk about it it's like forever ago I made this account like so long ago and I really wish I could have got Andrew Brown as my username but that's not what it is and so I'm just going to go here and say alt okay so this is a trick with Gmail that you can do you can put a plus alt on it or uh maybe a minus I'm not sure but let's go ahead and see if that works and I need to create a password so I like to generate really strong passwords um you can use whatever you want I like to use hold on here I like to use this site which is the uh password generator plus password generator.net um I should make a disclaimer if this isn't insecure don't use it blah blah blah but I'm pretty sure it's fine so I'll us to go like 24 and get a nice long password um and I'll just generate a few different ones off screen here and I'm going to enter that in okay so just generate out a few and I'm going to drop this in on here okay we're going to hit continue says it's strong that's good and then I got to choose my username so I probably can't get Andrew Brown and um so I need like another name I'm going to try Dono not available that's like my game uh gamer uh tag on um steam so what's another one that I could have uh we'll just say Andrew Cloud can I get that one so hard we'll just say Andrew WC Brown Canon I get that there we go WC is my M middle initials it doesn't stand for water closet okay I know it looks like that we'll go ahead and hit continue I hit continue again and so now what I need to do is do this verification please solve this puzzle so we know you're a real person uh verify okay use the arrows to rotate the object to the face in the direction of the hand okay use the arrows so I think I have to make it face the same way match the angle okay uh this way okay there we go create my account and so now I need to open up that email just give me a moment okay all right so I've been waiting a few minutes and I haven't seen anything and I resent the code so maybe it doesn't like emails that have that plus in there it's totally possible so I might actually have to go ahead and create a new email which is quite the headache as I've ran out of emails here uh unless I can think of another one you know what I think I have another idea I'm going to use uh a different one here so it looks like unverified can I change this I'm G to try um because you have an privacy uh privacy email uh will be used for account related stuff um yeah I'm not really sure what's going on here I thought maybe my account even exists but it looks like it already does exist so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to add another one I can do Andrew maybe at teacher seat.com we'll try that oh it's already in use oh my goodness it's so hard to get an email out here okay let me just think about this for a second all right all right another thing I'm going to try is I'm going to try uh maybe Accounts at teachers seat.com that's another one that I might be able to use okay and I going to change this over here and save it great and that should be my primary now right it really wants to send it to this one maybe what I can do is I can click oh looks like we have both okay so we have this one um please verify that I'm going to get rid of this one here because that one's not working I'm going to try uh accounts teacher.com so that's in my Outlook so I'll go take a look there and see if I get it all right so uh this is working out totally fine so over here we have um the confirmation email so I can go ahead and just verify that email we can also just grab this link I kind of prefer using the link here um because that just gives me kind of a guarantee and we'll go here and now we are in so this is exciting um it's been a long time since I've made a new GitHub account so I'm not sure exactly what to expect but it looks like we have some places we can start stting a new project collaborate with your team learn how to use GitHub hey I'm already doing that you don't need to do that GitHub let's go ahead and skip this for now and we should get back to our main dashboard so we are now in and we have an account that we can use um so yeah that's all I wanted to show you in this video uh but I'll see you in the next one okay ciao hey this is Angie Brown and this fall along I just want to show you that I'm going to be setting up multiple accounts to quickly switch between them um if you want to take full advantage of learning how to use GitHub you're going to need probably another account because you're going to have to have somebody else to work with so I already have my primary account I already showed you how to make an account so what I want you to do is make a secondary account I know it's a pain but go ahead and do that but what I'm going to do in this video is show you how you can log into both and switch between the two and I'm also going to set up a repository um that I'm going to put code examples in if we happen to put any in there so what I'm going to do is go up here at the top right corner I'm going to go add account and so this is going to allow me to log into my other account I can put in my username or my email so this one is um this is monsterbox pro.com that's my old my old company that's not been around for a long time but I've never updated it and the exam Pro email is on a another GitHub account but I'm going to go ahead and find the password so I can go log into this one so just give me a moment I'm just trying to find it here it is there is the password I'm going to paste it in here okay we'll hit sign in okay notice it says GitHub mobile so now it's my opportunity to show you GitHub mobile so what I'm doing is I'm opening up my phone and right away it pops up it says uh you know new signin request now it says reject or approve I'm going to hit approve it says authentication request was approved uh the first time I I had to do that I had to enter in like a code like two numbers but now from then on I just have to do that and it's very easy to uh to do that so if I want to switch between accounts we can go here and just switch between them uh freely so that is really easy and so what I want to do is go to exam Pro this is my other organization you'll learn about organizations in this um this here that didn't really help but what I want to do is create a new repo I can create a new one up here in green or I can go up here I never notice these up here but this is another place to do that anyway you're just watching you're not doing right now okay so I'm going to go ahead and hit new and in here I'm going to go to exam Pro I'm going to say um GitHub examples so this will be the um GitHub we'll say a repo containing GitHub examples for Pro for programmatic examples for programmatic examples this will be public because I want you to have access to it I want to have a read me I'm going to create that repository and so this will crop up later in the course and you'll have to know where this this is but just remember that is but the key part of this video was how to log into another account um and be able to switch between them okay so we'll see you in the next one ciao all right so what I want to do in this fall along is set up a GitHub organization and the reason we want to do this is so that uh it's going to make it easier when we get to that section so what I'm going to do is go to the top right corner and I want to I can make this in either or account I'm going to make it in the alternate account because I already have enough organizations in my main GitHub account and what I want to do is go over here to um maybe organizations and here it says uh you are not a member of an organization we could turn this account into an organization I don't want to do that or we can make a new org so I'm going to make a new org and notice right away it's going to hit us with some pricing so um you know teams gives you the full functionality we just want to have the free one uh which might have some limitations but um it should get us started if there's are things that we can't do um then I'll switch over to our paid one that I have in my account for the most part we should be able to do um pretty much everything as long as we're using a public GitHub um public GitHub repo so I'm gonna go ahead and hit create a free organization and so I need some kind of name for this organization um so I don't know but we'll just say uh GitHub Cloud Learners or journeyers okay notice that's be the name of it I say Accounts at teacher seat.com and this organization belongs to a personal account we could say uh business or institution but then we get a little bit more details there so I'm going to just stick it to normal and go to personal account then down below we need to solve our puzzle so we've seen this one before we'll rotate that out and we'll submit okay and you'll have to name your organization whatever you have to name it but that's what I'm calling M you can put some numbers on the end here if that makes it easier you do like four five six s or something because these are going to be unique names just like your your username going to go ahead and hit next and so now it says add organization members so we can go ahead and add some people so what I want to do is I want to add um Omen king so I'm going to go ahead and do that please don't add me all right add your own other account your two accounts okay we'll hit complete setup and so now this person has been invited not sure if they're instantly added um not yet but I believe that I was yeah here's the invitation so we'll go here so the invite has been sent and we'll have to go look for that so I'm going to go over here and switch to my other account okay and so now what I'll do is I'll click up here and maybe it's up here my notifications no do I have invites here no and um maybe I got an email check my email no email and this is something you'll learn about GitHub which is like invites are a pain and you always have to really figure it out so I'm just trying to think about where that or that could be um what we could try to do is type in the organization name which I thought we already did um so this one let's see my profile is this yeah so the organization's going to be what was it cloud oh I don't even remember we'll switch back to the other one what a pain okay and we will look for that organization GitHub Cloud journeyer so I'm just going to copy this URL I want the um view organization I want to go to this page actually I'm going to copy it here I'm go switch back and I'll enter this in and so now notice that it's showing me where the invitation is so it says Andrew Brown invited you to join this organization view invitations okay and I I don't know if there is but I'm just going to double check here because a lot of times GitHub will have like invitations invitations they might have a page for it they don't GitHub if you're watching make a SL invitations page so we can easily find them across them here so as you've been invited to GitHub Cloud Juniors ask for a GitHub copilot seat optional I guess this is kind of an upsell they're like hey do you want to be able to use GitHub copilot but I'm going to go ahead and join this organization and now I'm in there so there's two people in here again we'll come back to this later I'm the member this is the owner um and uh you know if your company is using GitHub they're likely going to be using using organization so it's good to get some knowledge on that but I'll see you in the next one ciao all right so I'm on the my oat.com and we can go ahead and build our own octocat so what I'll do is create your octocat you also getting started we'll do the exact same thing and it'll have a fun little animation here there's no audio but it's kind of showing you something we'll give it a moment here and so now we have the default octocat and we can do something fun so you can choose obviously a color I'm just going to go down one shade here for face um I'm pretty pale so let's go real pale here these just look like off colors to me but we'll do that for eyes we could choose anything else but I usually will do glasses so it's not going to matter anyway so if I go down here uh I'm going to want some glasses on uh we'll go to mouth we'll choose something there you can choose hair there's probably something that kind of looks like my hair um facial hair it's bizarre because they show like other ones that I could have I don't have a full beard but like they have this one and it doesn't show up do not want mutton chops okay we'll go over here to Tops I'm in Canada so it would probably make sense if I was to choose the Canadian one I know it's somewhere here where are you it was here the other day I wonder if this is like region specific nope there it is okay so I have Canada um I'm going to keep the bottoms off maybe have some skates and got a toque I should be wearing a toque shouldn't I no any accessories props whatever you want to have and the funny part is I don't play hockey but this looks good enough so what I want to do is save it so we can share it I'm not sure what happens if we do that click the share button oh that downloads the file so that's perfect so now we can use that as our profile I'm just going to quickly open that up in Explorer it's opening somewhere on my computer I'm sure it went to downloads but I'm going to go ahead and close that out I'm going to switch back over to my other account and obviously for your primary account you should treat it like a profile just like your LinkedIn profile if you're alternate alternate it doesn't really matter we're just goofing around so if we go over to um profile it's still not showing up here it is great so I want to go ahead and change this I'm going to change my avatar and then I'll click here and I'm just going to move this off screen here and I'm going to go find it there it is right there I'll hit open and there it is say Andrew Brown okay alt account this is Andrew Browns so at sign Omen King's alternate account for the purpose of learning GitHub since you need another GitHub account to make use of learning all of update our profile all right I can go and view my personal profile and I mean that should be there I don't see it we'll go back to edit I'm going click it again maybe it didn't upload it is there so probably what's happening is it's just a caching issue right um and so it's just going to take some time for that to show up so or maybe if I open it up another browser it will show up there but you know eventually it'll show up and I'm not really worried about it but that was octocat so um yeah I'll see you the next one okay ciao let's take a look at GitHub octocat so this is github's official mascot and it's a cat because and an octopus because it's supposed to symbolize friendly and engaging nature in the world of software development collaboration I don't know if I believe that but it looks cool so cool uh you can actually create your own octocat I thought that'd be a great opportunity for us to create a profile for our alternate alternate account or for both whichever you want to do you will see octocat in other places so um they have a bot that's called octocat that is used throughout the platform their SDK is called octo kit so you're going to see that themes in a few other places so you know where that is originating from okay all right let's make sure we understand clearly the difference between git and GitHub I don't think it's that confusing but it is in the study guide or exam outline so so I'm just trying to make content that they want us to know um so let's do a comparison and go through some things to make sure we understand the difference so git is a distributed Version Control System a dbcs and GitHub is a version control as a service I called it a Version Control service it can also be called a get provider or you can call it a version control as a service I'm just trying to get you exposure to all those different terms you could call what GitHub is for functionality for Git it manages source code history for GitHub it provides cloud storage for git repos of course it does more than that but that's its main functionality um for Access you're doing this via your local system installation or it's basically wherever it's installed the point is is that you're working on it on a machine on a server or some kind of compute uh and GitHub is accessed through a web interface because it is a cloud service for the scope we're talking about local repository management and then for GitHub we're actually talking about the online collaboration and remote hosting uh so anything that has to do with remote or things around the repo the git repo itself for collaboration it's for local changes requires manual sharing for GitHub it has integrated tools for collaboration like issues and PR and a lot of other features for usage you're going to be using this primarily by the command line interface there's definitely software out there that makes it a lot easier to use um we'll get into that but generally it's a command line tool that you're using for GitHub it has a graphical interface and it also has its own CLI tool but most people are interacting with it via the website okay so there you go ciao so a git repo or repository is your git repo think of your local one that you push Upstream to GitHub to be uh hosted remotely and GitHub allows you access to manage your re repo with several functionalities so here is a screenshot of a GitHub repo this is when I ran a boot camp in 2023 uh and so let's talk about what is on this GitHub repo page I don't know what they want to call this page I just called the GitHub repo page for a specific repo um but you can view different branches view tags view commit history explore repo files view releases uh see codebase language breakdown view top level markdown files and so those top level files might be the read me the license security other things like that you can perform actions from this page or quickly to it such as pinning watching forking starring cloning so uh a lot of stuff going on this page and this is going to be we're going to be spending a lot of time or uh going from here to somewhere else but that is a GitHub repo so there you go all right in this follow along I just want to give you a tour of GitHub repos so that you have a a general Fami familiarity uh so that when we start diving a bit deeper we understand what we're looking at so I'm on my dashboard I have a lot of different repositories um and so I can go here and find a repository I can search stuff and say like if I'm looking for my boot camp I can type in boot camp here and then make my way over here and find it um a lot of times when you are looking for stuff you're going to use the global search so up here you could do that as well well and I could find my own repos or other repos um there are a lot of Open Source repos on GitHub and so um I know rails pretty well so I'll go ahead and type in rails and so we have this rails repo I'm going to go open this open this up and take a look and see what we can see because this is a very mature Li um uh GitHub repo and we'll make it very clear of all the functionality that's happening so notice we have our main area this is where all of our files are uh we can actually view any of these files so I can click into any of them so I can go into the gem file and it will show me the contents of the gem file what I like about uh GitHub is that when you click into here then you kind of get this file explorer and it's extremely powerful uh if I click this on the right hand side it will show me symbols that's not a very good example I might open up a ruby file to show you what I mean so I'm just looking for Ruby file here and so this will show you like places you could jump uh jump towards in your code um that's really nice you can see who did what by going to blame so we can see exactly what some he doing by the way I'm going really quick here it's not important for you to remember any of this I'm just giving you a tour of stuff so just relax and uh enjoy the information that we're learning here you don't have to write it down if I wanted to find a file really quickly in this repo I could go here and type something in so maybe I'm looking for um something like View and so it's going to drop down and it has this fuzzy search if I want to find a ruby file I can type this in we have a lot of them here I believe there's a hotkey here so if I hit T if I'm over here and I hit t T it will bring me over there I can switch branches really easily um does that let me add a file it's not my repo but if I add a file I'd have to create a fork um the search brings that up there but we'll go back over to code okay so my point here is that you have all the files here and you can browse them um you can switch branches you can go and take a look at all of your branches you can take a look at all your tags you can star you can Fork you can watch here for code you could launch this up in code spaces which is a cloud developer environment I normally have um G pod installed so if I hit refresh that button might show up here this button you will not have this button I installed this because it's like code spaces but different um on the right hand side you get a bunch of information about the repo like stars watching Fork uh some of these probably are conditional because I don't remember seeing these on my repos you have releases so maybe you are building up binaries like downloadable files that people can uh utilize so some people they will host all their code here and they'll build the binaries for quick downloads so that's somewhere else you can go to packages is probably similar to releases I don't I don't think I've ever used packages ever in my life uh let's go over here and take a look browse browsing all packages yeah I don't know what packages do we can see who's using it the contributors so people that are writing uh writing code um we have the languages so you can see this is mostly a ruby LI or uh repo which makes sense because it's Ruby on Rails down below we get a preview of our readme file so that is in the top level directory they have a codes of conduct I imagine that is a markdown file here and as well the license file I'm sure that's in here as well the security policy as well um so yeah there's a lot going on in here and then there's all this stuff up here this these are features on top of your repo so lots and lots and lots of stuff if we want to see our commits we can go here and click on commits and this is kind of like a tree it doesn't give you the full view because when you are looking at um when you're looking at a tree uh there's branches and stuff so we're missing that information here but the idea is you can go here and uh go to different branches and look at those commits and that's basically all I wanted to do here we'll get into it a lot deeper later on but that is your tour of GitHub repos ciao hey this is Andrew Brown and in this video what I want to do is a quick and dirty get crash course um you are supposed to already have this knowledge uh coming into this uh certification even though they kind of suggest that you do and you don't um this is not going to be a complete crash course um it's just going to be uh the least amount of knowledge we need to know in order to be able to be productive in GitHub uh you really do need to make sure you know git very well and should look at other additional resources to go be on this little component but it'll be good enough uh we did create that repo or I created that repo earlier in exam Pro I think that's a great uh great place to start so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and log into my other new account so over here and uh I'm going to go and make my way over there so I'm going to type in for slash exam proo up here I'm going to look for this new repo here and um the reason I'm doing this normally I would just open it in my regular account but what I want to do is I want to show you how to fork and then we're going to do some work in here and you'll commit it to your own repo but what I will do is I will end up U bringing those changes over into the original repo okay so anyway the way we're going to get started is um there's a few ways we can go ahead and open up a terminal but probably the easiest way is to open up github.io that's going to make a copy of it and have a reference to it so I'm going to go and click that and notice it'll prefill the name in make sure it stays the same it says copying the main branch only that's all there is right now and that's what we're going to do so we'll create that fork and now we have GitHub uh uh uh GitHub examples and notice under our name we have it here it shows that it is a fork so I want to open this up in github.com okay and we'll give it a moment and I think that we can do stuff in here if we can't we'll have to open up a developer environment like a GitHub code spaces but I'm hoping that we can use this initially because we can write commits in here so this is open and um we have our readme file and on the left hand side we have this GitHub icon so this is obviously an extension installed specifically for GitHub but if we don't have a terminal we're not going to be able to do a whole lot here so we could commit stuff over here and maybe we'll start with that and I'll just show you how to do it with the goey so let's go ahead and I'm going to make a new folder I'm going to call this git crash course okay and in here I'm going I'm going to name it lower case I actually prefer when they're lower case get crash course and there's a few things that we want to cover okay so I'm going to make a new file here I'm going to just say readme MD and um a couple things I want to cover uh commits I want to cover branches I want to cover remotes I want to cover stashing because I think that's really useful I guess merging is something that would be really important and so I think that's sufficient enough to begin with and whether we'll do this in order I'm not really sure but we'll start at the start so the first thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and create um a a get commit and we're not doing this programmatically we're just going to start out by uh doing this over here in the source control so Source control is a builtin extension in vs code that allows you to um uh basically write commit messages it's really simple so what I'm going to do is just right here and say um create skeleton readme for get crash course okay and so I have my commit message and notice that we have changes that are staged so changes can be either staged or not staged so if I right click this here um I can H I click stage changes and now it's up here so what's the difference between being up here and being down below well when I go ahead and click commit and push it will only take the stuff that is from the stage changes anything else will be left behind because sometimes you're working with a lot of files and you don't want to commit them all okay so that is the reason for that um but the idea is that you can hit minus and plus and move them back and forth so hopefully that is very clear we can click on a file we can see the difference and changes this is a completely new file that we're adding so we're basically having having stuff that's added and prior there was nothing so it's showing that on the left hand side and we are ready to do something with this if we drop this down we can have Commit push I've never clicked on this before so I'm not going to do that but I'm going to go ahead and click commit and push and so what it's done is it's committed it and it's pushed it Up Normally you wouldd have to perform those as separate actions okay but we'll talk about that when we start using the terminal so now that we have pushed that up what we can do is click on this little icon or maybe not what I'm looking for is a visualization for our um uh for our tree here it is view as tree and that's not helping okay so I guess that doesn't do what I thought it would do and that's totally fine so what we'll do here is we'll go back and open this up in uh GitHub the repo so I'm just trying to find if there's like a short way to do that no there's not so we'll have to go ahead and type in GitHub I'm going to have to type in my name uh Andrew WC Brown this will be GitHub examples to get back to this repo and we can observe that we've pushed that commit so if I go here you can see our uh get commit we can click into it we can you can see our get commit we canot comment on stuff here so I can say this looks great all right add a single comment and so that should be pretty darn clear we have a uh commit Shaw so that's over here um there should be some way to get the full Shaw I'm not exactly sure where it is uh because I can see parts of it a lot of times if we click into here it might show it here so if we go here I could copy that go back here I can get the full Shaw right okay but what I'm realizing is that github.com mans but it doesn't so that's okay but we can use this as a means to quickly edit files what I want to do is go ahead and close this out and we'll go back over to our code and what we'll do is we'll launch up GitHub codes spaces so GitHub codes spaces has a free tier um and that's what we'll be utilizing okay I'm going to try to find the pricing here if I can and I'm not exactly sure where the pricing is but that's totally fine we'll go ahead and open up a new Cod space on Main there's a whole section of code spaces in the course so we will come back to this and cover it in more detail so we'll give it a moment to launch up is spinning up a virtual machine underneath uh so that's why we have to wait a little bit um or if it's not spinning up a virtual machine it's spinning up a Docker container on existing virtual machines that's probably what it is and so now we get a terminal and that's going to allow us to interact um with GitHub using git commands so I'm going to go down to the bottom left corner here I'm going to change my theme because I cannot stand working in a light theme and I'm going to change this over to something that is dark um so I'm going to go to GitHub dark and so this is a little bit easier to read we can also increase the font here if this is hard to read I'm going to do that by going to settings and I'm just going to bump up the font here to 20 for font size and I'll do the same thing for terminal so I'm typing terminal in here and I'm looking for font size we can also just type in font sometimes it's a bit tricky to find terminal font there we go and we'll turn this up to 20 okay so that should be a lot easier to read so I can go in here I'll click into read me now this is going to come preinstalled with Git if I type in Git it should be here okay so I didn't have to do anything it's already installed I'm not covering how to install git on your local machine I'm going to be doing everything in the cloud developer environment because it's just easier and I don't want to uh work through all those challenges of trying to show you how to do that um so normally what you'll do is when you start working with a repo you're going to clone it now this repo has already been cloned because we opened it up but let's say it hadn't been let's go ahead and just do that ourselves so what I want to do is I'm going to just CD back a directory and type in clear and type in LS and we're going to see where we are so right now we're in workspaces okay I'm just going to make uh a new directory and just call it temp I'm going to CD into that and what I want to do here is I want to take the first step into bringing in this repo okay and the way we're going to do that is by going back over to here and we're going to go over to code and we're going to go to local and then we have these commands we have htps SSH and the GitHub CLI and so these are ways that we can bring in um our repo okay and so the most common way is by using SSH where you will actually have to add a public key and we can do that the second one is https where you'd have to use your personal access token and there's the GitHub CLI and this I think is probably the way we should do it in the future but we're just going to work any way we can here so what I'm going to do is go back over here and we're going to go all the way to top and we're going to talk about cloning okay so we have three ways to clone so we can clone three ways HPS uh SSH and GitHub CLI okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start with htps so we'll go over here I'm going to copy this and I'm going to go over here I'm going to type in get clone I'll write it in here so we can copy it out but this is going to be get clone and I'm going to paste this in okay and since we're working in markdown and that's part of the course you have to learn how markdown works I'm going to put three back ticks and put an MD here okay you should do all this because we're just learning everything up front if you're wondering what the the back tick is it is is a character that's above your tab key see if I can find it for you here back tick key and it's this key right here okay so notice that there's a back tick it's a tick that goes back and so that's what I'm pressing I'm pressing three of those and the reason I'm doing that is that it will then render that out um it's actually not MD It's Just sh I don't know why I did that and if you go up here in the top right corner we can preview all the stuff we're working on for our documentation but anyway this is the first command that I want to run um so I'm just going to go up here we'll make a directory uh since so we'll say since we're using we are using GitHub code spaces we'll use we'll create a temporary directory in our workspace okay and so that's what we did so that's going to be sh stands for bash I mean it's not exact it's shell or whatever but it's pretty close to it and so what we did there is we typed in mkd slw workpace TMP and then we're doing CD workspace TMP okay and then the next thing we want to do is clone this uh repo so I'm going to go ahead and attempt that so it really matters whether the repo is public or private if it is public then we don't need any credentials to clone it but when we want to push it back up that's a different story so I'm just trying to copy that this is a bit finicky the the copy paste here control command V uh and it's not letting me paste it I'm going to try this again copy there we go right click paste for whatever reason from here to here it didn't work so I'm going to go ahead and hit enter and so I'm actually cloning from here now now we have this this is attached um to that other location so just ignore this for now we're going to pretend this doesn't exist and we're just going to strictly use the git commands to do everything so we've cloned this and I'm just type in clear and what I want you to do is type in LS hyphen La so what LS hyphen La does is it will show you all the hidden directory or hidden folders and um we don't have any yet but we're going to have to CD into this directory I'm going go go ahead and type in GitHub examples right and um so what we'll do is just type CD GitHub examples and so now we're in this directory and I want to type in LS hyen LA and so I'm showing you here that there is a hidden folder called dog this is how it knows that there is a GitHub repo okay so I'm going to go up here for a second and we'll make another thing so we'll just say GitHub or sorry get get a hidden folder so there is a hidden folder called doget which tells you that uh your project is a git project or a git repo okay and normally what we would do is we create our git repo outside of this so if we wanted to we'll see you back here I know this is a mess but I told you it'd be quick and dirty is that if we wanted to create a new repo we could actually go ahead and just type in get a knit in a new folder so uh you know if we want to to create a get repo in a a new project we'd create the folder and then initialize that repo using get nit okay so what we would do here try and get those back ticks here get a n cuz we're using Code we always use back tiex for codes so what we would do here is we'd create a new folder so so we make we'd say um mkdr slw workspaces and then we would say temp uh new project and then in here we'd have uh that new product so we' CD CD into it so we just say workspaces temp new project and then we would do get a nit we'd create some files so we' say touch make a new file so you say readme.md then we could open that file up so I could say open readme.md then we' make some changes to it uh so make changes to readme.md then we could Commit This so we' say get commit hyphen M hyphen M hyphen a sorry hyphen a hyphen M so add readme file all right and so let's do a little bit of that right now so I'm going to say mkd I'm going to say new project okay and then I'm going to go get a nit it initializes a new git repo we end up with this dogit uh folder here okay and then we could touch a new file so we say readme.md and then if I want to open that up I probably can type in open. MD I would imagine that it would open up in here it didn't what if I type in vs C vsvs code readme.md no how do you open files in vs code from terminal I thought it was just open terminal command what is it there must be like a command code I think we type code that's what it is code okay I us usually use Vim so this is not my primary editor so we open that up and I can say hello world okay we'll save that I'll type in clear here and now what we can do is we can type in get status so we can see what's going on here so we'll say get status to see what files are being tracked or untracked this is the exact same thing as this thing here when you're typing get status this is what this is right here that's your get status okay so we have files that are are tracked but nothing's change uh uh stage so we can do get add all okay I guess I missed that there get at all take this part out here because we don't need it and um it says you've added another git repo inside your current repo we'll just ignore this because it it's it's just confused because we have that other repo we'll type in get status and notice now these are changes to be committed okay so the idea is that these are going to be the things that get pushed let's say we didn't want to add in GitHub examples we definitely don't want to do that so I'm going to say git remove GitHub examples get status didn't really work that's okay um we can say sorry get I didn't mean to do remove I meant to say get um uh um Ty reset sorry get reset get status there we go so reset will'll put them back in here I actually only wanted to add that say get add readme.md okay so we go down here you'll say get add readme.md and while we're on it I'm gonna have to go and just say um reset get reset so reset allows you to um move changed files back to untracked files or un like change or sorry staged staged changes to be unstaged okay this is useful when you don't want to uh you want to when you want to revert All Stage change all files not to be committed sorry I know it's a bit messy but the idea here is that we're going to go here and we'll just say get add all get reset so I'm going to go here and just say uh G reset will revert a git at all okay we have ADD so this is get add readme.md get ad when we want to Stage changes that will be included in the commit we can use the period to add all possible files all right we have get status get status shows you what files will or will not be committed okay let's get status all right so I want to type in get status again here okay so this is what we want to commit so we'll go back up to our commit section here and um yeah over here which we were kind of working on it and we we'll go ahead and type in get commit okay so if we just type in get commit it's going to try to open up the editor so it actually opens up here so what I want to do is just comment something here so get commit when we want to commit code we write we can uh write get commit which will open up um the commit edit message in the editor of choice and so this is already configured to open up in vs code if you're running this in your local machine it would complain and say Hey you have to set a default okay so get config set default editor okay so if we had to do that I'm just going to look this up really quickly here editor normally you'd have to set it right so you'd have to first set that um okay and so this would be emac or whatever um set the global editor I don't know what it is for this um we could take a look and see what it is I just hit control C to get out of that because I really don't want to do that right now so let's go find where this is actually configured um so I believe that there is like a global get folder somewhere it's not there yeah I'm not sure where it is let we type in get config can we see that we type that in I just want to see what is being set for the editor um so I'm not exactly sure I just want to know what it is so uh you know get uh editor vs code default I just want to know what that value needs to be um so that would be set as what oh it's dog config that's the file we're looking for okay hold on so this would probably be in our home folder let's try this again so let's say code get git config where's git config stored where is git config stored um oh we just list it out okay let's see if that works okay um we'll go down here for a second the git config file is what stores your Global configurations uh for G such as email name uh editor and more okay so we go here and I'm just going to say get config hyphen hyen list uh and that's showing the contents of our git config file still don't know where that file is but at least we know what some things are set at and so what I'm looking for in here is that editor and it's not showing up so what I'm thinking is that it already knows what to do but it is setting our user. name and user. email this is something that you would normally have to set so I can go back to just get config here and customize and get and notice these are the first two things that they set right so um when you first install get on a machine you are supposed to set up your name and email okay and so those are the examples there all right so they're right here and you can see that they already set it for us but normally you'd also have to set the editor and it would complain but for whatever reason it knows to open it up already in uh envious code here so I'm going to go back up to here and so that's going to open this up interactively so I'm going to type in get commit whoops editor down below here I'm going to type in um first I want to make sure I'm in that that folder that new project oh you know what I created that read me in the wrong spot let's go back here for a second type in LS hyphen LA and yeah I didn't even make it in the right place so remove that folder we're going to remove the readme file new project I'm going to type in clear and I'm going to try this again so we'll type in m mkd or sorry just touch touch readme.md we'll open up this file so code read MD we just say hello world save that we'll close that and now we will type in get status there is no get repost we'll type in get AIT and then it's initialized an empty repost that's good we'll type in clear and then we will type in get status and now it's not complaining about that it us or that um GitHub examples because this is now in a subfolder so it's not trying to add a sub module so now we can do get add all we can do get status and now this file will be added and we'll do get commit which will open it up in here and so now we can write our message so let's just say add readme file okay I'm going to save that and close it okay so now it completed it it's created it if I type in get status you'll see it's gone and so if I want to see the tree for this I think I can type in get uh was it get log and it's going to show me uh that commit there so if I added another one it should show multiple commits here so let's let's go ahead and and modify that readme file again so I'm going just open it up again here uh code readme and what I'm going to do I'm just going to take this other Tab out of the way and open a new tab and have it over here so we can make sense of what we're doing I'm going to put another exclamation mark so another way that we can commit is in line is by putting the m flag so I'm going to type in get status and then uh what I want to do is add that file okay and type in get status again and now I want to commit that change this this part here and so what we can do is type in get commit and now we'll type in hyphen M and I'll just say add another exclamation mark all right and don't worry about the spelling I do not care and I'm really bad at spelling and here we'll type in get commit hyphen M add another exclamation okay so uh make a commit and commit message without opening at editor and so what we'll do is go ahead and hit enter and so that added there we'll go ahead and type in get status we'll do get log to see stuff so we'll go here and say log so get log will show recent git commits to the git tree um if we want to see more of the tree I don't know what command it is like is there git tree I always forget and the reason I don't remember is because often you're relying on these tools so there's some stuff you should know here and there's some stuff you should just utilize in here but you should know the basis of get commit commands Okay so that's good so we learned about get commit status a few other things okay and so if we wanted to take this project and push it up uh to GitHub it's not going to it shouldn't work because we don't have credentials but technically this account uh or this environment is actually um tied um to GitHub so it actually might work um how it would work I don't know maybe we add our personal access token um but we could just find out by trying to push so what I'll do let go down here below and type in uh push so uh when we want to push a repo to um our remote origin and so this is so just be simply get push this should not work because we don't have a repo to push to okay and so we have to add a remote um so we can do get remote add origin and then put the name there but we haven't created a repo so there's nothing for it to go to so even if we added a remote it's not going to work okay so this project here is done so I'm going to go ahead and just clean this up and we'll just go ahead and type in remove RF new project so that's going to give you some ideas what you can do there so what I want to do is LS and I want to go back into this one because this one has um sorry a get folder and let's just open that up really quickly so we can take a look at what's in there so we open this up I typed in code it opened it up in a new repo I'm not really sure why try this again code. git I don't know why it's opening up in a new repo there I guess it's confused um but it did work the only problem with this is that it's opened up another developer environment so in here this is all the files that are in this why couldn't do it over here I don't know but um if we just take a look here uh closely we have the config folder and this is what I showed you earlier in those slides this is how it knows what the origin is this is how it knows how to push to main we have some core configurations here and there's some other stuff like we have reference and stuff like that I don't really want to get into all this stuff um because it's just too much but uh the most important thing to know is this config file because that's where these things are and so if you ever get this stuff mucked up like your remote or origins or something's not working you can fiddle with stuff in here um and that's all I wanted to point out here so I want to just stop this um this one here so I'm just going to go ahead and close this out there's some way to shut this one down I'm just going to close it out and should stop it with with GitHub code spaces you you got to really be aware of all the ones you're running because then you can run through your free hours very quickly so I'm going to just see what's running I'm going to see if I can just type in code spaces up here there we go I just want to make sure that I'm only running one okay it looks like I'm just running one so I think all it did was it opened the same uh running environment in another tab because it got confused which is totally fine but anyway this file is now gone and let's focus on this one so we created this repo here and technically we should not be able uh to push up to it now we might be able to because it might be storing our personal access token or some credentials but in uh technically it should not work so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and try to add a file to this repo okay sorry I don't want to lose this one um and see what happens when we try to push okay so uh what we're going to do make sure we're in this repo we're going to type in touch readme.md and then I want to open this one up so I'm going to type in this here I'm going to say hello world we'll save that and the idea is that this is the same repo as that other one so actually we just um we just technically edited this one so you know what I actually don't want to make this file here because I realized that's going to causes a problem uh what I'm going to do I'm just going to LS here I'm going to CD in to get crash course and I'm going to make a new file here we'll just call it um uh hello so just say touch hello okay and then we'll open up this file here oh sorry code and then we'll say hello all right so it's not here because of course we're ignoring this okay but if we type in LS Ty and La we have this hello file right and so if I type in get status I can see that this file is untracked so I want to add it and do get status type in clear and now I'm going to do a get push so this should fail but it still might work let's see what happens it says everything's up to date and the reason why is that we didn't create a commit right if we do get log you notice we don't have anything this is the last one we ran so I'm going to do get commit hyphen M add hello file okay and now I'm going to do get logs so I can see that it's there right and now I'll do a get push and it did work so it probably worked because this environment already has the stuff loaded up if I was using my local developer environment this should not work um and I suppose I could show that I'm just trying to decide whether I want to do that or not um give me a second to think about it yeah I think I really should show you this so what I'll do is I'll open up vs code on my local computer and we'll do that okay so my point is is that even if you're not doing this I just want you to watch and understand what you'd have to do if you're using your local developer environment the trick with local developer environments is they're really finicky because um especially on Windows because you have to get Linux installed and you need the windows subsystem Linux and that's such a pain to work with so I'm here in vs code this is on my local computer and what I want to do is I want to uh bring down that repo um and so what I'm going to do is just open up terminal okay if I can find it any day now here it is um and I need to store this somewhere it's opening up in Powershell but I want to use Windows subsystem Linux okay and I'll give it a moment here and so it's it's starting up Linux and so here it's on my desktop in a folder called code okay I'm just going to type in LS not sure what this is but I normally like storing things in a folder called sites so I already have one here and the idea is I want to um I want to clone that repo into here so what I'm going to do just bring this over here for a second all right so this one was uh this was this one was no good I couldn't really show you this example here so I'm just going to go ahead and remove this one and we'll just get this back to normal okay type in that clear and I'm going to go back over to here into our G GitHub crash course so we can keep working on this and I want to go back up to commits or sorry cloning and I want to go ahead and attempt this clone uh that we're doing earlier so this is mine right of course you'll have to switch this out for yours so understand you can't just copy and paste this you have to modify it but I'm going to copy this I'm going to go over here and in my Linux system I'm going to go ahead and paste this in because I think I already have get installed right and it's downloading it here okay so I've downloaded it because it's a public repo but the question is can I push to it so I want to open this project up here in vs code I'm going to go ahead and type in code period and that should reopen vs codes in this context I'll get rid of this old one here out of the way that was some other thing I was working on I'm going to say I trust the authors it's totally fine and apparently there's a newer vs code I do not care and it's opened up this entire directory so I kind of messed that up and I'm G to go into terminal again so sorry you can see I have a bunch of stuff in here I'm going to CD into this by typing in um GitHub examples and we'll try this again I'll type in code period and then I'll close this one all right and then this time we now have our local developer environment in good shape okay so just understand that you can connect GitHub codes spaces to your local one I don't want to do that I because I want this to be detached from git so I can show you the challenges of cloning so this has been cloned already we already did that and if I go over into terminal here okay new terminal and I want to make sure I'm in uh WSL which I am I'm going to type in lsy La I want to see that I have that dog directory here and we're going to go ahead and modify this hello file I'm going to put an exclamation mark I'm going to hit save and so the idea is I'm going to do get push and I'm expecting it not to work so it says it doesn't work work would you like to sign in with GitHub no I don't want to sign in with GitHub even though that's awesome I don't want to do that and the reason why is because I want to show you how you would use a personal access token so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over here bring this down and I go back to GitHub and we're going to go over to here and we're going to go to settings and then all the way down to the ground we're going to go to developer settings and we're going to click into personal access tokens and we have a fine grin access tokens you don't need to use access tokens very often this is just for this specific use case we're going to go ahead and generate this token I'm going to say um temporary token uh local Dev and I want this to expire uh in the least amount of time so today is Sunday I'm going to say tomorrow uh this token is just for today and I want this for a very specific repo so you can say say all repos we're going to say a select repo I'm going to go here and select my one repo and for repository permissions um I just want to be able to push this and work with it count permissions so I just have to make sure I give this proper permissions um PLL requests merges issues um I'm trying to give it permissions to just push code push commit so I think we definitely want this read and write want commit statuses read and write and I think that should be sufficient I'd probably put poll requests in here as well before GitHub used to just have like you'd make a classic token you wouldn't have to do all this but they're trying to make it more secure so that's how it is uh um and so I think this is sufficient so I go ahead and create this token and so I now have this token so the idea is that um when I'm over here normally this would prompt us it wouldn't do this oh yeah we have the username up here so it's asking us to enter our username in here normally this would prompt down here but it's not so I'm just going to hit clear okay and I'm going to try try this again say get push I'm saying cancel and so it's prompting up here if you're not using vs code it would normally show up here so I'm going to type in my username like this and now it's asking for a password and before you could put your actual password in here you can't do that anymore you have to use this personal access token so if I got those permissions right this should work okay so I'm going to paste that in hit enter and so now it says everything up to date so did it push that's what I want to know so we'll go back over to here um and if we click here we can go um um oh sorry down here I'm looking for how to find this repo there was a button here before why can't I find it maybe it's over here no that's fine but we want to go ahead and look at that repo so I'm going to go and type in Andrew WC Brown and I want to look at our only repo that we have and I want to see if those commits work so if I click in here we have ADD hello file and that didn't do anything so maybe it's because we didn't add anything let's go get status here get status we have to add it if we want it to work right we say get commit update and then I'm going to type in get push and so it's trying to log in so every single time we want to push it's going to ask us for that because it doesn't remember what it is we can technically cach those credentials um I'm not sure what the flag is I've never had to ever have have to to do it but there is some way to Cache it we're going to just hit cancel because I just want to show you how to use that personal access token okay and uh then I'll go go back there and grab that I think we still have it there good okay I'm going to go back to our local vs code I'm going to paste this in hit enter and so now it pushes okay so it's pushed it there and so that's one one example of us doing that okay we'll just confirm that it's there we can see it right there so that's one method of cloning so go back over to here to our uh documentation in GitHub code spaces so here we'll just say uh you'll need to um so you'll need need to generate a GitHub access token or sorry personal access token and we'll go grab that link so we know where that is so it's right here okay says this it's a beta feature but I can't imagine they'll revert that you will use the pat as your password when you log in uh and the permissions we you know give it I think we need that all right so that's one way another way is with SSH okay so what we'll do is I want to get rid of this token because I don't need it anymore I'm just going to go ahead and delete that and I want to go back to our repo which is over here and we want to clone this VI the SSH and because I can't trust GitHub because I think it's uh the GitHub code spaces it already has our credential somewhere we're going to have to do it this way so I want to CD back here I'm going to remove this directory okay clear and I want to clone it again and so this time I'm going to grab the SSH if we go over here we'll paste this link in here and it looks really similar but this is not the same link SSH okay and we'll want to CD into that so the difference here is that look at this this says htps is the protocol this one puts the stuff in the front so it's a different protocol um and and URL for cloning so we go ahead and copy this and we'll go down below I'm going to paste this in and hit enter okay so it can clone because it's a public repo if this is a private repo we would have to already have our credential set I'm going to go ahead and um close this out and we want to reopen this so it should know this is the same thing but because we deleted that repo it's confused so I'm going to go into GitHub examples and I'm going to reopen this up in vs code it'll open up a new window not sure what's taking it so long okay it just autod detected it so I guess it didn't have to do that it's fine but um we'll open this file up again and I'm going to put an exclamation mark on the end and so I'm going to do get status right again we can do it over here we refresh it but I'd rather do it from here so that's not there I'm going to say get add read me or period now let's refresh it notice it moved to Stage changes and then we can do get commit hyphen M update SSH way all right and it pushed um how did it do that because it's not supposed to work um so it makes me think that that personal access token is still there okay oh no no no no no no it it didn't push it didn't push the reason I'm confused is that notice that this said push so when we go here this will let us commit and push sometimes but we've only just committed it locally okay so if I type in get status all right it's here okay it's not um it's not it's not remotely there okay so in order to actually get it get it up we have to type and get push so that's a separate action so we'll go ahead and type in get push so now it should complain so this says rejected um and the reason why it's rejected is because we don't have an SSH key so what we'll need to do is generate out an SSH key and the way we do that is we type in SSH key gen hyphen T I believe it is and we type in RSA to be specifically what it's for we even say the length of it this is a Linux command uh mode Linux distributions should have this preinstalled so you can definitely do it the place that you would put this key would be in a very specific location so I already have a default one and I'm going to rename it to something else but you can leave it as a default if you want if you've never ran this command in your life I'm going to go ahead and hit enter oh you know what it's key gen SSH or key gen SSH keyen I forgot what it is already keyen SSH it's SSH key gen okay so go back here I'm Type in SSH key gen TR RSA okay and it's saying where do you want to create it it will usually create it here I want this to be named a little bit different I'm just going to say um GitHub alt and then I'm going to say ID RSA okay and then I'm going to hit enter for no passphrase a passphrase passphrase is a way to password protect it I don't want to do that you don't always have to do that um but it makes it more secure notice that it generated up both the private key and the public key we're going to talk about key pairs later in the course I made sure to cover this they didn't make it a requirement in the in the uh uh the uh the guide or the uh the C the certification course but I know you need to know this so I made sure to put that in in there so we've generated out this uh private private and public secret and they're located here so we're going to need to get the contents of this one and send it over um to to GitHub so the way we can do that is we can just grab this URL or write this out and and Cat it out so cat is a way in Linux to print out to the terminal and so I'm going to type this full path I'm hitting tab to quickly complete uh this so I don't have to write it all out by hand and I'm looking for GitHub GitHub alt ID RSA it's kind of not showing me all the files I'm going to just go ahead and type this here for a second okay and um weird it's not there so it says TS RSA enter the file in which to save it oh it didn't actually save it here did it save it over here it did all right I don't want it here I'll try this again so we'll hit up because it wants the full path that's why um and so we'll do this again we'll say home Andrew SSH I'm going to say uh alt GitHub ID RSA enter enter enter so now it's where we think it is so it's actually here I'm going to copy this and we'll type in cat and we'll paste this in that's going to give us this funky looking thing so this is the contents of the public key and I I need to copy that so I'm going to just do this and write copy I I did contrl C because I couldn't rightclick it um and I'm going to go back up to here and then in GitHub we got to add that to our account so I'll go to settings and I'll go over to SSH and I'm going to add a new SSH key I'm just going to say paste this in here I'll just say uh local uh environment you might even say what computer this is from you might have multiple computers with local developer environments so I'm on my my my Windows machine so Windows local and you know we have two things here I believe it's an authentication key and we'll put that in there so this should allow us uh to now push okay because it will it will match the private and public key out I explained in the course how it works like the logic behind it but this should work assuming I set it right so what I'll do is I'll type in get status because we should have something ready to push right so notice it says here your your branch is ahead of origin by one commit so we have one commit that hasn't been pushed yet we'll go ahead and hit get push and if we did it correctly it should work and so I did something wrong um what I did wrong I'm not 100% sure um so we can try that again so I'm going to go ahead and go back up here because this format might matter it might be in the the wrong format but I'm pretty sure it should just be this give this a refresh here um says never used I'll try this one more time maybe takes time sometimes it's VY like that nope so if it didn't like that I'll try signing I don't remember there being to key types before so I'm a little bit confused myself and I don't remember this stuff off the top of my head if we copy this wrong that could be the issue as well but we really want to copy the public key okay notice it says begins with R RS or that okay so I'll paste this in it's definitely the right format so I'm not sure why it doesn't like it Windows local we'll try this again okay and we'll go back over to our local environment and we'll say get push still doesn't work yeah I don't think it's the signing key we'll try this one more time new paste and like that doesn't seem like that's the problem right maybe it's supposed to have a space let's go back and take a look at uh vs code this has a space in between it okay this has a space okay so SSH key gen key not working GitHub it's not uncommon to have issues like it just happens to me sometimes um sometimes we can test it out we don't have to set the origin because we cloned it e that should be fine I'm not really worried about that um SSH key gen GitHub because maybe they might tell us like it give us an example and then um maybe I entered it in wrong maybe it wants it in a very particular format because it can be finicky give me just a second okay so not sure if we have to do this but maybe we need to add the SSH or the the key to our our SSS agent um I remember doing this one time but normally it usually picks up anything that's in that directory so I'm actually kind of surprised but if that's the case let's go ahead and just explicitly set it so let's give that a go and um so we'll just hit up here and I'm just going to go ahead and type in SSH add and add your SSH private key okay and that's just RSA there like that put enter could not open a connection to your authentication agent just a second um it's suggesting you run this line again I'm kind of getting the territory of like doing anything which I don't really like the SSH program runs in the back room to hold your private Keys keeps them ready use by SSH okay well let's try this um and again this is why I don't like showing local development because it's so finicky it's a lot easier on a Mac but I can't share my screen on a Mac so I mean you could but I I it's very difficult for me to do so so now we've added the the identity and I'm hoping that now this will work there are debug commands that you can use so like GitHub SSH debug um like here there there is like this you could run so attempts to connect to SSH to see if it works so we could use that and give it a test um go back over here right and hit enter hi King you successfully authenticated but GitHub does not provide shell access so that's one way we could test that's a good command to know um we'll go here and say put this here we can test our connection here we will need to create our own SSH keyy key pair RSA key pair so that' be SSH key gen TR RSA for uh WSL users and if you create a um you WSL users and if you create a key in a a different a if you create a non default key you might need to add it so that was us running that um like this here so that might fix that issue for us um this is for testing our connection so that's telling us that we can push okay and so what I want to do is go back over to here and let's see if we can push get push fingers crossed and normally what happens the first time you add something it's going to add it uh to the key ring usually ask us to uh say yes but it's still not working so I mean that might establish connection that we can reach you you successfully authenticated but does not provide shell access okay um so our keys still not working we have permission denied are we pushing to the right repo yeah we are it looks like we are um one thing we could do is check that hidden folder it's not showing them here there's some way to show hidden folders and get not sure why it's not showing up give me two seconds I've being told the hcky is control shift G control shift G if you're on a Mac it might be Control G that didn't work for me I tried it what is it command shift period control shift period nope no good so we'll just go to our settings and open it up hidden Files come on show hidden files I just want to see them show hidden files files exclude preference settings files um yeah so I I want to see that there we go so it's it's it's hiding some of them the reason I want to go here is check the config I want to make sure that we're going to ours because if you try to push to mine let's say you cloned mine it would not work because you can't push to mine you don't have permission to do so but I I should have permission to push to my own here's another question when I upload those keys what account was I in okay I'm in the correct account so this is the one that I'm supposed to be in uh uh is it though because I might have had another tab open let's make sure we're 100% in the right location we are here I'm going to go to SSH Keys it's not here you think you know what I think I did I might have added it to the other account or we deleted it we didn't add it back in so I'm going to go ahead and add this in Windows local you really have to think these things through and think okay check check check check check all right and so I what I want is that SSH key again I think it's going to work this time okay uh I don't want to add it I just want to C it okay and we'll go back up here and we'll paste it in and we'll hit uh add the key and now this time I think it's going to work get push excellent okay great so that's now done I want to go back here I'm going to delete the repo again because we have one more way that we can do it okay and the last way is going to be with the GitHub CLI so I'm on local so I might as well just go ahead and install it I'm going to delete this key because I don't want to have it I want to see if it will work without a personal access token or or without SSH so that we can attempt to log in so what I want to do here is I want to install uh that and I believe that it would use Brew or whatever so type in GitHub CLI install we'll go here and um it's going to be different based on what you use so if you have home brew installed you can use Homebrew if it's Linux um it's going to be different um I'm looking for Ubuntu in particular so Debbie and Ubuntu are basically the same way of installing it and um I think that we could probably just do it this way so we need to do a pseudo app update I guess I have to put my password in here is this my password like I don't know yep that was my password so that's doing an update once that's done it will do the next step so I'm going to go grab this here we're going to go back over to GitHub codes spaces close this one out I guess we never saved it that's why it didn't work um and so our third way is GitHub CLI install the CLI okay EG Ubuntu for Linux Okay so in this particular case I believe this is Ubuntu and that's Ubuntu they're both Ubuntu and I'm going to grab the next line here and we'll paste that in that's going to install it could not locate the package if it couldn't locate the package it probably doesn't know where the package is so I have to go back over here and so this adds The Source that's what it wants so I'm going to just go grab this whole darn thing is this all the same command no it's not but we we'll grab the whole thing and this will actually install all of it in one go paste you can actually see that it's doing an update and then it's installing it here so I'll go back here and update our docs a bit messy okay and so once that's installed uh we'll have to do a couple things we'll have to do GH login and then we'll have to do GH clown and get that link we'll go grab it from our repo um so go here we'll go to code we'll go to CLI we'll grab this and we'll bring this on up here and I'm going to do GP well I want to paste that into our uh example here see GH clone Okay g GH login now we technically don't need to log in for uh this to work should be oh I think it's j off login that's probably why there we go GitHub um oh we're going to choose a method uh htps authenticate with your GitHub credentials yeah I thought it was going to just do something for us but apparently it's going to have to rely on on something like that so if that's the case I think what I would rather do is use the SSH key so I just hit control C to log out of that and what I'm going to do I'm going have to go back and put that that SSH key back in because we deleted it um it doesn't matter if you see mine because you don't have my you can't see my private key so you really shouldn't show anyone your public key but it's not going to hurt that you see mine um I'm going to go back over to here and add it again I guess we're going to go down to here we're going to add that SSH key Windows local okay and then I'm going to go back over to here we'll type in clear um I want to just update the doc so that says off here we'll save that we'll bring this back up we'll type in clear and I want to do GH off login and we'll log with GitHub we'll use SSH and we'll tell it which key to use which is pretty cool and the title for your SSH key well why do I need to upload it title for your SSH key oh it'll actually upload it for us oh that's cool okay clear it let's go back I didn't know could do that we'll go ahead and hit delete and we'll try this again GH login that's really cool I like that and we'll say SSH I also wonder if it would generate out your token for you so we'll use this one and we'll say windows local and um we'll log in with a we web browser first copy this onetime code into your browser press enter to open github.com your browser okay I'll hit enter and I'm going to log in with this we'll enter that code in we'll continue and we'll authorize it and so now we're logged in okay so we can now use GitHub to clone the the CLI and we'll go back over to here okay and we'll copy this and we'll go back over to here and we'll paste this in and we should be able to clone so maybe I I typed that command wrong it doesn't look right it looks like it's doubled in here I'll try this again we'll hit enter sorry try this again that's not working so I'm doing something wrong let's go back over to our docks have it in here double and uh oh maybe it's like GitHub repo clone that's probably what it is there we go and so we clone the repo all right we'll CD into that directory as per usual um we'll go in here and just say hello get add uh all get commit say GitHub C way and we'll say get push oops get push and that worked okay so that's all of our ways that we can do it locally I'm pretty much done with this I'm going to close it out and so we've learned um all the ways here so that's pretty sweet um this get get repo clone so that's good we learned about commits okay um learned about adding we haven't learned about branching so branching is pretty straightforward we're going to be doing a lot of branching so I don't feel like I have to do a lot here right now um but uh what we can do here is we can type in get Branch to get a list of branch branches say list of branches okay and we can go ahead and create ourselves a new Branch so I'm going to go ahead and type in get Branch um and then type a name so we'll say um Dev and I'll hit enter so create a new branch Branch name if I type in get Branch I can get a list of them okay and so I can check out that Branch so we'll say check out the branch get Branch I'm sorry get checkout Dev get checkout Dev and notice I'm in dep this highlighting stuff here will not be in your local terminal uh you might have to install something or additional or invs code it may or may not show up just understand that this is preloaded with some stuff in here um so we're in Dev right now we're actually in a different branch so I'm going to do um get um uh I want to change this file here so we go ahead and just change it uh where is it'll refresh oh you know the thing is is that we've been making changes but we haven't been doing them in here so if I do get fetch for a second you'll notice that origin main is there's more going on here than you than you think and so by doing fetch we can actually see if we're out of date or not um and so my issue right now is there's that file I don't have access to it but I'm going to go ahead and make it again I'm say hello here and I'll say uh Branch version okay and I'm going to do get status and so we have that there um so what we can do is go ahead and go get add all and I'll say get commit hyphen M uh changes okay and now what I want to do is get push and push that branch and right away you're going to notice that it's not going to work and the reason why is that Branch does not have a remote right that's really important because if it doesn't have a remote reference it's not going to be able to push and there is no branch in our GitHub repo right now if we go back to our repo um in mine is listed over here remember your name is different than my name so type yours GitHub examples let's go here into here um you know I have a branch here it should well we don't have one yet we haven't created one yet so that's one thing uh that we need to make note of um so the thing is and the other thing is like um have we been making these changes this entire time yeah we have um but anyway so yeah we have a branch that's that locally but we don't have one that exists yet and so the idea is that we want to we can either create the branch and then push to it or we can basically run this command and do it in one go okay so what I'm going to do is type in get push and I'm actually going to type in U because that's a much shorter version of this I'm going type in origin Dev okay and now it is tracking our Dev to the remote Dev if we go over here this Branch might exist now okay and if we drop down you can see Dev is there we haven't pushed anything into it if you go to commits our new commits not there yet right go to main you'll notice main is over here right um my point is is that uh we need to for this to work we will need to um uh push this change so we have this one file and I'm going to go ahead and say uh get status okay oh did we actually push it oh I think we accidentally pushed it so maybe we did make that change yeah we did it's over here okay sorry so I thought we had not pushed it yet but we did um now the question is how do we visualize this in a way that is easy to read and that's where we would have an extension normally there's one installed like in git pod they'll have preinstalled but apparently this one doesn't um so what we'll do is go to extensions we'll type in get tree okay because I want to be able to see what we're doing and there's G graph so G graph is the one I usually use I think we'll go ahead and install that there's another one um I'm not sure like get lens some of these can get pretty crazy so I try to keep it really simple get history yeah we'll stick with G graft and so once get graph is installed if we go over to here we should have a new icon up here um and so I don't see it sometimes down below it'll be down here so I can click this no that doesn't help either and so maybe what we need to do is reload our environment for it to show up I'm going to hit Refresh on here and just hit enter and so hopefully what this will do is load it up again so we can see that because I want to see that g graph what do you mean doesn't exist uh okay it's telling me it didn't exist because I hit a refresh there um okay I'll open up code spaces because it seems like it's confused right now this one's running open in browser we'll try this again here give it a moment to reopen what do you mean ites doesn't exist it's right here you're crazy we have it open so it's saying it doesn't exist but we clearly have it open but it's opening the dogit directory okay let's CD back for a second what is going on oh no I really don't want to lose my changes I don't think I'm going to because everything's pushed but this is where it's kind of acting weird again I don't use gith GitHub codes spaces I prefer git pod but this one's acting a little bit funny um and so in this case I'm not 100% sure what to do because it does exist here so what I'm going to do is stop this code space okay and I'm going to start it up again and maybe what this will do is it will un Jank it okay so I'll be back here once once it stops and then restarts it takes a little bit of time okay okay it shows me this button I'm going to hit restart start code workspace and hopefully this will resolve our issue it's saying the workspace does not exist the terminal process failed to launch the starting directory so it's getting confused I don't know what's going on here but this workspace is is defunct so what I'm going to do is again stop this workspace we'll open up code spaces I'm going to stop this one and I'm going to delete it because it's not really doing what I wanted to do I'm not going to lose anything because everything we worked on we should have pushed at this point but uh yeah you just got to be careful code spaces because it kind of Acts a little funny but uh we'll go back over here and what I'm going to do is I actually want to open up this Branch we have the two branches but I want to open up code spaces in this Branch I'm going to go ahead and drop this down I'm going to say create a code space on dev okay and so hopefully we don't run into any more issues it looks like it's losing all my settings so it's not persisting them uh there are ways to persist them syncing settings um there's an option I think here we go into here because this is going to drive me crazy if we don't do this and we'll say automatically detect not DOT files but um sync settings so I'm going to click this and I'm hoping that what this will do is anytime we change branches or stuff it's going to remember my settings I don't want to keep changing them so I'm going to go here and it should be syncing settings now I'm going to go and change my theme again and I'm going to go over to settings I'm going to go to uh uh I'll change the font size to 20 here 20 was a bit too large we'll say terminal font here I'll change this to 18 okay and so I also want to make sure that my extension's installed so I'll try this again personally I think they should have this preinstalled that's the other one so there's get log graph and get graph I'm going to install both of these because I actually like both of them to be honest and uh we can add this to our Dev container yeah make a new Dev container um I don't know make an empty Dev container I want whatever the base one is base Bare Bones you know I just want the configuration I'm going to go ahead and just say barebones Ruby here sure and just say Okay I I don't want that so I'm just trying to create this file in here so it knows to remember our extensions um for this repo go back and do that also for here it should remember it but in case it doesn't I'm going to put this in here and I'm going to go modify the step container this is also something we're going to learn about later on um I don't want to build anything so I'm just going to take this out here here and I'm just going to take this out as well U just say basic config get graph I don't see the other one added there I'm G to go back over here and try this again get graph um add to Dev container there they're both added there but the reason I'm doing that is I really want to get these tools in here so now they're here they show up here and they show up down below so this is one of them we'll open that up it's before I made a pull request and there's the other one so I just want to show you there's more than one kind of tool that you can visualize the stuff and sometimes it give you different information and so right now we're here we're in Dev okay and we added that one those couple changes over here and the idea is that we branched over here so this doesn't know about these changes and vice versa and we got a whole lot going on here okay and so this is is where we get into things like merging so if we want to bring um Dev up to date with main which we really should do we should merge main into Deb and that's what I'm going to do so I'm in dab I'm going to type in get merge main um and sorry I should I should note that there's origin Main and then main so that's there's what's on Origin there's what's on our local Main and so our local Main might not have this stuff okay if I go over here it's a bit more clear because it shows them as separate thing so our head shows us exactly where we are right now we have origin Dev origin main so I'm going to do a get fetch because I want to know where we are right now and it looks like we're all up to date so we're fine what I'm going to do is I'm going to type in get merge Main and it's saying did you mean to merge no I wanted to merge Main and so it looks like we don't have a local branch of main okay so what I'm going to do is type in get checkout main okay and so now if we go back up here we maybe there's some way to refresh this like a refresh button notice there's two now okay so before it didn't even know there was a main I did check out and immediately it said there was no main branch but it said oh you have one on Origin main we'll just add it here now it's here okay so now we have a main and I can go back to Dev and I'm just going to do get fet it's just out of habit and so now we see both of them here okay so now I'm going to do get merge main it says we have a conflict okay and the reason why is that we went ahead and we changed read me and that other file and they exist there as well and so sometimes you have to resolve conflicts okay so this say Auto merging merging conflict automatic merge failed fa fix the conflictions in order to complete this here and so normally what happens if you pull or sorry if you try to do if you try to do a pull or you try to merge and there's a conflict you have to resolve it and so notice right away that now we have new files over here this wasn't here before we go here we can see type in get status it wants us to resolve it and the message is a little bit different here says you have un unmerged paths so we gotta fix this here and so it's showing us in this file we have two versions which one do you want to keep the top one or the bottom one so I'm going to just take the top part and take out this part because we don't want that committed and so these it had no problem and so what I want to do is I just want to go ahead and add this and we're basically just adding everything uh adding everything at this point so I'm say get add all and then I going to say get commit and in this case you do not want to put a a get commit message in here because it needs to put it its own in here I'm going to hit enter and it's going to open and this is the this is the merge message it has to be this you don't ever set this so notice I typed in get commit and it also filled it in here and so all I'm going to do is close this and now it's merged it so if we go back over here now we can see it represented okay so we took that and we brought that up to dat right okay so and the reason we want to do that is so that when we merge back into main we don't have to deal with conflicts you really don't want to deal with conflicts merging in main you want to do deal with those those conflicts in your branch before you merge back in main okay so that's good now what we can do is now that we're all up to date we can continue to work on our readme file so I don't need this dogger file this wasn't supposed to be here but that's a great opportunity for us to delete it because I don't want to launch up a ruby environment um so what I'm going to do is type in get um get remove well first I want to yeah get remove Docker file no no no I don't want to do that um I just want I'm going to go ahead and delete this here we'll just delete this permanently so if we go over here this should show up here yeah we can do that I think we could have just typed in if we deleted the file it would show up there anyway but um G remove is a bit funny because you can have files you want to remove from tracking that are in your repo to say stop tracking this forever um or uh if there's even there's pre previous versions of it and there's removing the file so we'll just delete and now we'll keep it simple so I'm going say get ad and we'll say get commit hyphen M remove Docker file we don't want to build a Ruby Ruby environment um so this I have to put a single comma there so I need to point out that like we can rebuild our codes space um and and then it would build that Docker file but but we'd have to manually do that because it won't do that until we rebuild it manually but anyway so we have that Chang there and I'm going to go ahead and do a get push and we go back and take a look and we can see that this is now pushed up to date it wasn't pushed there a moment ago and so now Main's starting to get out of date but let's go over to our readme file in our crash course and what I want to do here so I want to do a few a bit more documentation so we'll go down here here below and so we can add remotes but often you will just add remotes when you are doing uh when you via Upstream when adding a branch so be get Branch um U origin new feature but you could do it like a get remote at I like I rarely ever do that so I I don't feel like really covering that here that would be something I would actually cover in a proper uh get crash course um I don't know if we really need to do stashing right now we could leave it or take it get merge main so get checkout Dev get merge main okay so I like we've done a lot here I don't want to overload you folks um I think I'll just show you stashing really quick so um let's say let's say I wasn't I wanted to work on something else and I just wanted to move this to a side and come back to it later what I can do is add all the file so it's staged get status okay and I could just stash these for layer I type in get stash and what that will do is it will put it in in I'll just put it somewhere okay it'll put in my stash if I type in get stash list it's here in my stash okay and I can bring it back and say get stash pop and pop it off the stash and bring it back you wouldn't want to do this in a cloud developer environment because you could lose changes but if you're in a local developer environment you might just have stashes and just hold on to them for a long time but a lot of times you need to move things out of the way but usually you want to name your stash so you'll say get stash save and then say um read me change so we know exactly what it is and then we can do get stash list and see what's there and then we can say get stash apply and instead of popping it'll just apply the last one um so there are some commands there that are useful so we have get stash list get stash get stash save my name then get stash uh apply a pop and we have apply and then we have get stash pop okay so those are really useful I use them all the time again I'm hoping that as we go through this course we'll run into scenarios where we need to use them um but I do actually want to add this so I'm going to go ahead and get get commit hyph M minor updates um I'm just going to refresh this make sure I have that latest one there sometimes you miss them and I'm going to go ahead and do that and I just want to show you what the graph looks like so you can see even shows the stashes as well and dev's in front of it we're going to do get push okay now let's say we wanted to do a pull request that's something we're going to learn later in more detail but I'm going to just do it really quickly a common thing that you should do is open up pull request so um I'm kind of done with this uh workspace I'm going to go ahead and just close it out because I think the rest of this we don't need to do in here I'm going to go ahead and stop this okay we can leave it in this state if we come decide to come back to this but I'm going to just stop it for now and I want to go back to our repo GitHub Andie Brown and we'll go to our repo and I'm going to go ahead and open up a new pull request so I'll go here I'm going to create a new po request and I want to have the polar request come from Dev into this it's showing me everything I'm not sure why it's doing that but I'm going to go here and go from Dev into Maine and from Andrew Brown into Andrew Brown I want to be into my own I want to merge I want to make a pull request into my own there we go it's simplified that's what you should see and so what I'll go go ahead to do is hit create pull request and the idea is that this would be an opportunity for people to review it so uh will you accept my code right and the idea is that somebody's supposed to review it now because I'm the only one in my own repo um I'm just going to merge it myself and confirm that and so the idea is that that is now merged if we were in GitHub we would see that that was now merged into main okay all right so now what I want to show you is just the last thing is I just want to show you how I would bring these changes into my Fork so I'm going to switch back into my other account actually before I do that I'm going to go ahead and go into my poll request and I'm going to create a new pull request and I'm going to make a pull request from Main from this GitHub account into the exam Pro one the base one I'm going to go ahead and create this poll request I'm not telling you to do this please don't do this because I don't want to deal with a bunch of pull requests this will be uh documentation changes documentation for GitHub uh or sorry git crash course I think I called this like GitHub crash course which it should be really GitHub git crash sces show me the basics of G okay so go ahead and create that pull request all right and the thing is like I can't merge it from here because I don't own that other one so what I'll do is switch over to this and now I'm going to go and see that there's a poll request and it's coming in from Andrew Brown oh how nice of this person and I'm going to go take a look here and I can see that they have some changes and I can go and review their C Cod and then ask them to make fixes I can go here and say hey do this do that and then I might accept it but I'm going to go ahead and approve it I don't need to approve it here because there's no required reviewers for this but I'll just say it's approved and then we'll go over to code and I'm going to go ahead and sorry pull requests I'm going to go ahead and merge this stuff in because I I want this stuff okay and we'll merge that in and now it's merged just one other thing I want to want to see if I actually named this right get crash course yeah it's named right okay great and so there's our stuff that's all the stuff we learned was this a mess yes could I have taught this a lot better if I organized it yeah but I got to record the rest of the course and again you know if I'm going to make a a proper get crash course I'll do it somewhere else um but I just want to get you the basics and hopefully that was helpful we wasted a lot of time on cloning but that's something that's really important to know how to do and I'll see you in the next one ciao hey this is Angie Brown from exam Pro and we are taking a look at get commit so we're going to take a look at a series of G components uh in this course um it's not really a focus on get skills but more so GitHub but I want to make sure you still have some git skills so after we go through uh some of these things I'll then do like a really quick and dirty uh git uh command crash course okay so a g commit represents incremental changes to a codebase represented with a git tree so a graph at a specific time so here we can see that git tree um this is in GitHub so it's not the full representation when we go into U vs code we will we can see a better representation of it there are external tools for that but for the most part the idea is that you have um uh you have get commits that are over a historical period of time then we have have our uh git commit here is one within uh GitHub that I clicked through and I looked at okay and from here a get commit contains additional modifications deletions of files uh additions and deletions of file contents and it's not the whole file themselves and this is a strategy to make the uh commits efficient because if you if you were to store full copies in every single commit your repo would get really big really fast I'm going to repeat that again and we'll talk about the contents of commit fils here just shortly each commit has a Shaw hash that acts as an ID so it looks something like this we can use this uh to check out very specific commits which is very useful I want to repeat git does not store the whole files in each commit but rather the state of changes this greatly reduces the file size so uh so for developers to the developer you it will look like a whole file but really when you store it in in uh your git tree it's not going to be like that um so what are the components of a git commit we talked a little bit about that but we have that commit hash that is a unique Shaw one hash identifier for the commit I don't know if it's really Shaw one because I'm not really familiar with all the different types of Shaw but it's Shaw something uh we have the author information so we have name and email often you have to configure git to say what email you're utilizing the name so that's attached to the commit message uh or the commit itself you have the commit message this is the description of uh the the Commit This is we're going to be spending a lot of time when you are making commits because you want to write good commit messages you have a time stamp so this is the day and time when the commit was made um you have the parent commit hash this is a sha and hash of the Commit This commit is based on I don't really understand that because I've never had to bother with the parent one but it is something that's in there and the snapshot of the content a snapshot of the project at the time the commit not the actual files but references to them and the changes that are occurring so if you had vs code open and we were taking a look at a um at uh changes that we have staged so they haven't been committed yet but you can see here we have uh the commit message it says remove old comments we have files changed that we plan on putting in the commit and you can see some deletions there on the right hand side we can have additions so hopefully it's very clear what a uh a git commit is you are going to need to know these basic commands and we will get a little bit practice again quick and dirty this is not a fullblown git course but it'll be enough to get you by so that you can do the GitHub stuff so we have a bunch of stuff there like get add get remove get Comm message with the The Hyphen m flag to add a message hyphen a to automatically stage all track changes if you have a commit you haven't pushed it up uh to your uh your remote repo you can amend it um you can create empty commits uh you can specify the author if you need to you can check out a very specific commit but yeah that is get commits in a nutshell I'll see you in the next one ciao hey this is Angie Brown and we are taking a look at git Branch so G branch is a Divergence of the state of the repo there might be better uh descriptions than that but that's the way I think of it you can think of branches as being copies of a point in time that have been modified to be different and so what I want to do is Step you through what it would look like working with get branches and this is going to be a little bit messy and it doesn't matter if you can remember or make sense of all this because it will make more sense when we start working with it but do your best to follow along here so imagine we have a git repo in that git repo we have a main branch and basically all git repos have a main branch and that's pretty much the standard name for them now and we're going to also have a production Branch so the main branch is where we're going to have code uh that features and bugs will be um rolled up into and then when we're ready to push it out for production it will go to the production branch and some cicd tool we'll push it out and automatically deploy it so um let's imagine we already have a commit in the main branch uh maybe there are previous versions in the production Branch we're not going to worry about it so uh you have developer a developer a needs to to work on a very specific feature they're going to open up a feature branch and in there they're going to put in some commits and they're working along uh meanwhile in the company somebody already has pushed some stuff into the main branch it's not ready to go in production but that commit is now out so what's important to note here is that feature Branch one is not aware of that new commit because things are happening asynchronous a in async manner in different branches and this is the challenge with get is that you have to deal with all this Asing stuff and make sure you bring those changes into yours deal with conflicts things like that now let's say we have developer B and developer B is working on feature Branch to and when they started on their on their um uh their feature they decided to Branch from this point in time okay and so they start working on it and they get their feature uh done and um they get they talk to their um uh the director of engineering and and they make a poll request the poll request gets accepted it gets merged back into main okay and so developer a who's working on uh feature Branch one has all these changes that they still don't have so let's remember that they're going to have to deal with that at some point but anyway that feature got merged into Main and it looks like it's ready to go into production so it gets merged into production and so this particular commit contains I'm G get my pen out here contains all of this information right and it's all packed into here if that makes sense okay I'm just going to erase that here and so that gets ped production and it gets tagged a lot of cicd systems will trigger when a tag is applied that's definitely how I do it but now coming back to developer a they're on feature Branch one and they have all the stuff um that they need to get their Branch up to date so what they'll do is they'll merge back in in their Direction I know it doesn't show a merge but they'll merge that information into feature Branch one so they are now up to date and they have now finish their feature by doing a bit extra work and so they've merged back into into the main branch and now their stuff is to be rolled up to production so it gets merged into production and then that gets Tagged so hopefully that gives you kind of an idea of uh this kind of workflow this should have really been like that uh and this actually has a very particular name it's called the GitHub flow now there are some variations of this so that's why I say very close to it because in case I'm wrong I want to have that buffer to say that well I didn't say this is exactly the GitHub workflow but this more or less is the GitHub workflow where you are creating branches feature branches merging it back into some other branch and then you have a branch for production uh you can have branches for all sorts of things you can have specific environment Branch branches like staging development production you can have specific branches to developers so like based on their names you can have branches per feature features branches per bugs is going to be based on what your team wants to do all right uh there are definitely get Branch commands you should absolutely know and we will do again a quick quick and dirty crash course so you are familiar with it this is a extremely common pattern that you're going to find that you'll be doing which is you'll be creating a new Branch for a feature you're going to be adding changes you're going to be pushing it Upstream we might do this via vs code using the G CLI we might be doing this using using GitHub uh creating a branch from an issue but we'll definitely be doing this because this is something that happens a lot um in professional um uh teams is that they're creating feature branches so hopefully that makes sense and again if it doesn't wait till we go ahead and do it and then it will make more sense then okay ciao hey this is Angie Brown and we are taking a look at get repos so these represent the reference to a remote location where a copy of your repo is hosted so when I say remote get remote I'm saying remote reference or remote ref you might see those terms uh used all over the place uh you can have multiple remote entries uh or remote references for your git repo and the most common one you're going to see is called origin it's almost always uh there everybody seems to use it it indicates the central or golden repo everyone is working from and represents the source of Truth uh the remote entries or references are stored in your dogit config we don't really talk about this dogit folder in any of the slides but the dogit folder is how you know that your project is a uh has a a git repo in it because it needs that folder uh to initialize a git repo we'll look at that in the quick and dirty crash course um so in here in the config file you can see we have remote defined so this format of a file is called a toml file um so anytime you see those Square braces and then definitions that's usually a toml file but I'm just going to get my pen tool out here the idea here is we're saying we uh we have a remote named origin and the URL is pointing to our GitHub repo this part says how it should fetch I'm not going to get into that right now and then down below we can see we have some branches that we are tracking and they're pointing to remote origin and then they they're saying that we want to merge um there so hopefully that is clear notice remote names can be referenced so we have origin up here and it's referencing this up here okay so I'm just going to clear my annotations here so this is a little bit more clear and there are a bunch of get remote commands you should know I don't remember the most like the git remote ad I don't ever remember that one because often when you clone it's going to add them anyway and so usually you pull them from GitHub but you should know push you should know pull you should know fetch uh and when you are creating branches you should know um how to uh push upstream and we'll talk about upstream and downstream next okay all right let's talk about the concepts of upstream and downstream so imagine we have GitHub who is hosting our remote repository and then we have our local developer environment or Cloud developer environment uh this is local basically where we are doing our work and so they both have a main repo because we know that git is decentralized so we can have repos in more than one place we might already have some commits on the remote side but what's going to glue these two together is going to be the remote and so we set up a remote tracking Branch okay and and you'll see that turn when you create uh and you push branches up because the idea is that it's tracking uh the origin is pointing to main so this is the way we track them uh we saw that was stored in theg getconfig so when we go ahead and we perform a poll from our local developer environment we call this Downstream we're pulling Downstream so a repo that pulls or clones from another repo and just understand this is relative to the direction or the perspective um of who's pulling so if the remote was pulling it would be down stream it's it's anytime you're pulling it's always Downstream and now imagine we have commits we've been working locally we want to push those up to remote we would call that Upstream so this is when you are pushing changes so that's Upstream that's Downstream and when we have a remote reference it is a tracking Branch so there you go okay hey this is angre brown we are taking a look at GitHub flow so this is a lightweight workflow for multiple developers working on a single repo there's a lot of variations on this uh so this is not a technically perfect description of it but there really isn't one and I want to show you a really old graphic um I don't know how old this is but I've seen this in older ones maybe all the way back to 2008 at least and I remember before GitHub flow because GitHub came or sorry git came out in 2005 and it took a few years to gain adoption so for a long period for a few years we just had a mess of stuff and then somebody came up with this maybe it was GitHub I'm not sure but uh it's called the GitHub flow and um here we have a bunch of branches and it looks very similar to the one that I showed you in get Branch it's a little bit different and so the big difference is that well first of all uh we don't call it Master anymore we call it main but my main was the develop branch and then I would call this Branch master I would have called it production because I think that makes more sense and a lot of people do that these days but when it first came out this is how we were doing it okay so understand as variation but the idea is that you have this one branch I call it main this is developed and it holds things that um that uh that hold feature branches or hot fixes and everything it's basically like rolls everything up but it's not in production yet and so the idea is that when these things are ready for um production you can push them out into a release Branch a release Branch could be also called staging that's normally what we call uh today and this could be where it would roll out so once you push stuff here this could go out and execute a cicd pipeline and it would set up a staging environment so that QA could be done on it or any kind of load balancing could be done on it or stress testing um there and the idea is that as developers you would open up feature branches off of develop and as you complete them they would come back in here uh and they would get merged in and then when things were really ready you take it take it from uh release branches and push it out to your production branch which they're calling uh here uh Master if for whatever reason you had a serious problem you had to fix really quickly you could um uh create a branch off a master into the hot fixes and then merge it back in skipping all the stuff down below uh you know again I wouldn't do it this way anymore I would be surprised if companies are sticking uh to this method but this is the original way I just wanted to show you that there is variation um and you know a lot of people do skip having a release branch and they'll just deploy often and into production so it's going to be really dependent on your team so here we'll just kind of loosely describe GitHub flow you create a branch for each new task or feature create a new Branch off the main branch add commits make changes in commits commit them to your branch open a poll request start a discussion about your commits reviewing code in the poll request discuss a review share your poll requests with teammates for feedback deploy test your changes in production environment um so yeah oh and the last thing would be merge so once your changes are verified merge them into the main branch so that's the general concepts of it and hopefully that makes sense and we will see you in the next one hey this is Angie Brown and we are taking a look at the GitHub CLI so this is a command line interface to interact with your GitHub account you can quickly perform common GitHub actions without leaving your developer environment and uh if you went through the quick and dirty um git uh crash course then you definitely got some exposure to GitHub CLI but the idea is that you'd have to log in you can perform actions there so we have something like creating a repo creating an issue uh reviewing a PR there's a lot of uh CLI commands uh the get up clii can be installed on Windows Linux or Mac OS um that's an example of using Brew to install it if you have it for um uh Dev containers you can specify it as a feature to get installed so that is a very easy and quick way to have it uh installed there and just to give an idea of commands we have our core commands we have a lot of additional commands and then we have one specific to GitHub uh actions command so we're definitely going to get some exposure uh to GitHub CLI uh in this course but there you go all right so in this follow along I want to take a look at the GitHub CLI and see if we can do a few different things with it what I'm going to do is switch over to my other account um this is just my uh playaround account for for GitHub and we should already have a repo in here called GitHub examples and what I want to do is I want to um you know just do some things in the CLI so I need some kind of environment to work in and so what we'll do is launch up a code space uh we do have this older one um I think what I'll do is make a new one I don't think it really matters if we make an old or new one that other one is stopped so we'll open this one up and we'll see if the GitHub CLI is already preinstalled it could be preinstalled on this because I would think that if well if I was GitHub I would have it preinstalled so people could start using my product right away but if it's not we'll definitely go ahead and take a look at how to install it we did install it manually locally um in the git crash course a quick and dirty crash course so uh you know if we don't have to show the install I'd rather skip that but we'll wait for this to spin up okay I have no idea why but that took a little bit time to spin up um you know our goal isn't to really make anything just to play around with the um the CLI here the code space is currently running in recovery mode due to configuration error I didn't do anything I don't care it's um I mean it's a new environment why should it be recovering is there something it can't do yeah I'm not sure about this so what I'm going to do because I don't trust this workspace is um this one is running here I don't know we'll just see what we can do with it but it didn't pick up myh settings when I told it to save it earlier so I don't know if it's because it's in recovery mode or not but for the time being I'm going to go ahead and change the theme so I'm not upset there we go that's a lot better and I want to see if we have um GH install so it's not installed which is totally fine um so what I'm going to do is if we had this installed can we install it through here sometimes you can install stuff through plugins right and so I'm just curious if we could do that there no okay so that's fine we'll go ahead and install this and I definitely know that Brew is installed or maybe it's not installed on this let's find out it is installed on git pod but I'm not sure about GitHub it's not okay so what we'll do is we'll look up the GitHub CLI and we'll go ahead and install it we already did this before but we'll do it again and what we're looking for is those install instructions and we want it for um Linux okay so we'll go over into here into Linux and we'll grab this oneline command it looks like a lot but it's really just doing this update and this install like down here but it has to add the repo so it knows where to install it from but I'm going to grab that big thing there and we're going to go ahead and paste that on in say allow and hit enter and um it failed it failed and I can't look at I can't see what I'm doing so I'm G to bump up this font I do not like GitHub code spaces I'm so sorry I really like G pod and we're going to go here and say terminal font I'll try not to complain too much about it in the course but uh I can't promise anything I'm going to copy that again and we'll try this again it hit enter no such file directory okay um yeah I don't know what you want so there's this line here okay maybe because gpg gpg isn't installed sometimes you don't have to do a gpg check but we might have to with this and um failure to write destination okay so if that's not working maybe what we could do in an easier way is we could just add it um to the uh uh to the that this file this code space is file so we could just make a Dev container um and maybe that would be less of an issue so what I'll do is I want to add a Dev container um we'll go up to here Dev container like that we actually already have one from before and maybe we can just throw it in here so grab this maybe we do want to commit this maybe this is a good good idea um and so I'll put this here and I need a comma there and so the idea here is that this should install the CLI into this environment and maybe the reason why this thing messed up was because it wasn't specifying any base image and that's why it got upset because when we did this in the tutorial earlier um it kind of complained or sorry like when we spun this up it complained but we didn't specify a base image so I'm going to look up what the base image is for Dev container the base image for GitHub is and maybe that will help us if that doesn't help let's go let's go ask chaty BT log in let me in let me in come on I pay for this let me in what is the what is the base image used for uh Dev container for GitHub Cod spaces let's see if that can figure it out it's probably just going to go to the um the documentation but um I don't remember where it is so if you don't specify one it will create in the default one okay that's what I would rather it do so I'm going to leave it alone and what I want to do is rebuild uh this environment because we've added this change before we do I need to commit this maybe so just say um it should install the GitHub CLI go ahead and do that and I'll say okay so it should sync it up good and so let's see if we can find the rebuild I'm clicking up here rebuild that's no good we can open up the command pallet this way command pallet has all the commands for for vs code and there should probably be something for codes space so if I type in codes spaces there's probably something here to rebuild there it is rebuild container so I'm going to go ahead and rebuild that container I'm going to go ahead and hit rebuild and so I'm hoping that we'll install the CLI and that avoids us having to install gpg or whatever it wants because that's a headache and I don't want to deal with that so see you back here when this finish is building okay all right we're in it says the code space is currently running in recovery mode due to a configuration ER please review the creation logs update your Dev container as needed or rebuild the container so clearly doesn't like something about my file I'm not really sure because there's not a whole lot in it uh um so we have command control shift p okay control shift p hey like learning's learning right and uh we want to view creation blogs oh that's just to open up the uh command pallet view creation log and somewhere here it's messing up now I don't understand how it could be messing up because we literally have next nothing in it um yeah this is supposed to be an easy easy GitHub CLI tutorial failed to create the container an error occurred unified containers error creating fail doesn't even tell us why it's just like nope it doesn't work maybe it's up here um no matching entries and P unable to find us your Dev container okay maybe it's this okay let's take this out all right and uh that's probably the reason why okay so we'll save that okay we'll have to update that don't change remote user okay want Push to Main and I'm going to try to rebuild this again I'll open up command pallet down here below just in case and I want to say rebuild um I want to do like a full rebuild let's do a full rebuild that's fine let's rebuild and we'll get it going this next one okay I'll see you back in a moment okay so I think that resolve the issue it took a while for that to rebuild but what I want to see is if the C is in here so I'm going to type in GH and there it is okay great so that's the easy way to get in there as long as you don't make any mistakes in your Dev container uh Jason or J yes or Json Json file and so let's go ahead and see what kind of actions we can perform so what I'll do is go over and type in GitHub CLI and we'll take a look at the documentation and see that's not what I want I want the uh official documentation so we can see what kind of commands we can get here it is okay so here's all of our commands and the question first is are we logged in because that's something we might need to do so let's go ahead and type in GH login oh sorry GH off log in to log the C and we have two options we'll do github.com it says the value of the GitHub token environment is being used for authentication to uh okay so it sounds like we already are authenticated because of um get up code spaces and it's loading some kind of temporary um token in here something we could check here is to see if there actually is a token being set so I'm going to type in EnV grep and we'll type in GH and I don't see anything there but apparently it seems to think that it is ready to utilize so maybe what we could do is list out repos so I imagine if we go here there's probably something like list there is and we could try to list our repos so let's go ahead and try that GH repo list and we have a repo that's actually a really nice display what else can we take a look at here um so again back over to the repo we can list our repo what if we go to view what would that do let's take a look GH repo View and I was hoping that it would set it would select the current one but apparently it didn't but we can do uh GH repo set default and I got to type it right maybe it'll let us choose the repo so we don't have to goof around and so there it is we can choose one and apparently we have two exam Pro and the Andrew WC Brown curious that it's showing forked ones but this is the one I want CU this is the account I'm in right now and so let's go ahead and type in GH repo View and so now we can see some stuff in here um not a lot of information it looks like it's kind of the information about maybe the description or stuff like that so I was hoping to see a little bit more there but that's okay let's go down here and see what else we can do um we could edit our repo like we could change features turn things on or off that's not that interesting something we might want to do is maybe we might want to uh maybe change our labels let's go ahead and try that out so I'm going go here and say GH labels list um is it just label or labels label oh cool yeah we can see our codes can we add a new one in here uh we'll go to create so GH label so we try this one here copy it paste it in and there already is a bug so we can't have two so I'll go here and just say um danger something really not right we'll hit enter and so it looks like we've created another label let's go ahead and hit up okay so that looks really good there bug isn't working good um if we wanted to create a new repo sometimes what they'll do is they'll um they'll create like a uh a wizard in here so if I typed in GH create repo and I said um GitHub we just we'll just do this I bet it will prompt us oh I got to type it right I seem to be typing everything wrong here today repo create and so it'll ask us some things like create a repo from a template repository make a new one so I could do this say GitHub um repo GitHub CLI example and I'll just go hit enter here I'll just make this one private I could add a readme file we could add a Gore we could say what we want the get ignore to be so maybe it's for C++ now let's add a license we could choose apachi 2.0 um we want to do this we'll say yes and it seems like it should have created but we get a resource not accessible by integration for 43 so I'm not 100% sure as to why we're getting that it could be a permissions issue because everything is based on um that token right and so maybe we have a personal access token that allows us to read but not write um and we got a 403 right so 403 error is for forbidden meaning we don't have access to do it so what I'm thinking is that we can probably create our own um personal access token and try to get around that so we going to go to settings here I'm going to go all the way down develop for settings and we're going to go into personal access tokens find grain tokens and we'll generate a new token again I don't know if this will work but I'm just going to try it so we'll just say um uh repo access right let us create a repo and I'm I'm going to set this for tomorrow because I don't need it forever and if it's for all repos then that's a challenge right but then how would you create a token this is public repos so here it says this applies to current and future repos owned by this resource all all includes public repos read only so the other question is is it because we tried to make it a private repo but then why would it have it as an option if we can do that I mean we could also authenticate uh via SSH so I'm not sure so I guess that's where I'm not 100% sure so maybe we'll just say all repos here and we'll go to repo permissions and I'm looking specifically for repos contents no and carefully looking here to try to find that uh account permissions maybe it feels closer to this type in repo uh let's see here so what does this one do interaction limits uh interaction limits on repost I don't think it's that and so I'm just carefully looking to figure out what functionality we would have to Prov divide managing repository environments it could be this read write I would probably put this in just because that is the usual um oh repo creation it's up here so I don't think we need these other ones I'm going to leave them on because they're not that big of a deal um and this one says it's mandatory so sure we'll have that in there got it added in there I'm going to go ahead and generate this token and so now we have this token I'm going to copy it I'm going to go over to here I'm going to type in export GH token and I'm going to go ahead and paste this in and so the idea is that when we use the um uh the CLI it should pick up this as opposed to what what else is on here so I'm typing EnV hyphen GP because I want to make sure that this is actually set as our environment variable if you have other tabs open here it might not show up so just stay on the current tab we'll go ahead Andy try this again another reason why it might have not worked is because that name was already taken but I don't think so because it's scope based on our user so we go ahead and try this again from scratch so we say GitHub CLI example and then we'll say uh we'll put nothing in there we'll make it private and it was interesting there's a visibility of internal I imagine that maybe that's for Enterprises we'll say yes yes and it doesn't matter I'll just choose that one we'll say yes doesn't matter I'll choose that one and we'll say yes let's see if it works now clone the repo locally yeah sure let's do that and so now it's working so whatever key whatever personal access token that is somehow being loaded in there did not have the correct permissions we're able to get around that so I don't really want this repost I want to go ahead and delete it um let's go take a look and see what actions we have there we have delete so I'm going to hope that it just will like give me a wizard so I don't have to pick it so we'll say G H repo delete um and I don't want to delete our current one so I'm going to hit contrl C because that's totally not what I want and we'll go back over to here and we'll take a look and see what we can see for the uh repo I really wish they would list them up here maybe if we go to the getting started or available commands yeah that's a little bit easier it's not great but uh we'll go to repo here and we'll go to delete and we can can put the repo name here so we'll go back over to uh GitHub here we'll go to our name this is going to be Andrew WC Brown and we should be able to see two repos in here there's our other one I'm going to grab that name and we going to go back over here and I'm going to say that so do we want to delete it so type the name again sure and we have to put in all so uh the username in front of it we'll hit enter and that repost should be now deleted we'll go back over to here okay and it's deleted so that is in good shape so that's all good so I'm really happy with that I'm going to go ahead and stop this uh uh code code space I'm just going to delete it and you know I'm going to delete the other one I'm just going to make sure I keep everything nice and clean and and not worry about overspend and what I want to do is just merge this into my other account again you don't have to do this you can just watch me do this but it's good to watch because this is something that people have to do a lot and actually what I should have done is I should have gone over here and I should have done it from here first so I'm going to go here and create a PR create create a new PR and we'll say create is it going in the direction we want yes it is we'll hit create um fix Dev container we'll create that pull request good we'll switch back over to our other account and then I'm going to go into uh the same repo I'm going to accept it confirm it and we are in good shape I'll see you in the next one ciao a common strategy for authenticating uh to perform git operations on your remote GitHub repo is by using an s sh key uh you're definitely going to want to use this because it is a great way um to work with Git uh in your local developer environment it's definitely the way that I like to use it as opposed to using a personal access token but uh the way it works is you'll have to generate out your own SSH uh key using a command like SSH key gen for Linux there's probably different ways but that's the way that I know and specifically an RSA key I'm sure there's different kinds of uh keys that uh GitHub will take but that's the one that I know and so the idea here is that we have our computer our local computer and then we have the server which is a GitHub and the idea is that there will be a copy of the public and private key on your local computer and then on GitHub you'll store that private key and so the the process of authenticating and authorizing is going to go like this so the server checks to see if you have the same public key if you both have the same public key it's going to send you a challenge message that challenge message contains the public key uh encrypted and so it's going to send that on over and then uh the idea is that um the private key on the local computer will decrypt it and then it will be able once it decrypts that message it will then take the private key and do something there and then send back a well it won't do something it'll send back a signature um and then that signature will be sent to GitHub and then they'll verify it and that will establish that connection allowing you to use SS keys to get Clon or push or or things like that uh under your account settings SSH and gpg keys is where you'll be able to add the public keys so here you can see I have a couple SSH keys in one of my GitHub accounts and it's there under SSH and gpg keys and when you want to go use um or clone a a repo you're going to really want to use that SSH style address it will not not work with the htps one or the GitHub CLI one technically will work with the GitHub CLI one but that's what you're going going to want to do there so there you go in this video I just want to show you quickly how to create SSH Keys we did cover that in the quick and dirty uh git crash course but it's good to do things more than once so that we really get good at them I'm going to open up a new environment here in code spaces and we'll get that spun up so I'll see you back here when this is ready okay all right so we have this environment spun up and it's just not remembering myh settings whatsoever but you know that's just how things go and I'm going to make a new folder in here I'm just going to call it um SSH keys and I'm going to just go ahead and make a new readme file so normally what we'll use is the SSH keyen command I realize that's small I'm just going to jump it up like that and so we use t t RSA to make an RSA um uh style key I would imagine that GitHub can support different kinds not that I know much about the different kinds let's go take a look here and see what we can see so that's from local I'm going to go ahead and delete that um because I don't need that right now if we go here you can see things like SSH RSA sha 2 something like that so it be interesting to generate something else out so ecd SSH key key gen ecd so I want to see if we can generate something that's a bit more secure I I assume it's more secure is a relatively new crypto cryptographic solution um it's been around for five years okay so how do we make it and the way we make it is probably by supplying this like that okay great so what I'll do is go back over here and we'll change it from RSA to this one and see what happens I've never done this before but I imagine it's super simple and I'm going to CD into the SSH directory I'm going to go ahead and hit enter say allow yes I want to paste we'll enter and see if it can do this and so we'll go ahead and hit enter um it will create it in the codespace directory so I suppose that's fine and we'll do that and that and so then we're going to get that key and then the idea is that we can then go ahead here and then we could go and cat out the contents of it right all right and so we could copy this and it's actually a lot shorter that's actually really nice I like that and then we could go over here and then we could add it so just say uh Cloud developer environment for CDE and we can add that key now I want to point out that you can add keys to repo as well so we're not going to really test this to make sure it works I just wanted to generate out another one and show you that but what we'll do is we'll go over to our repo because I want to show you where that deploy Keys things is and if we're in a repo like this we can go to our settings and there should be deploy Keys down below and we could add a deploy key and it's the same process you just paste it on in you say what it's from uh you can say whether you want to have right access and boom there you go but a lot of these um repos only need readon so especially if you're building you're just cloning the repo so you don't need that but that's all I wanted to show you so going to go ahead and Commit This okay so we'll just say uh basic instructions for SSH okay so that's all good we'll say okay and then what I'm going to do is just switch into my other accounts and I probably can merge the other way too um if I try that so if we go here to pull requests we go to new pull requests and I could probably try to grab from that other repo so I want to bring in from here from there yep I can do that and then I'm just basically allowing myself to pull the changes and without the other Andrew having to uh Put It Forward okay there we go and we are merged I will see you in the next one so deploy Keys allow you to attach public Keys directly to a git repo and the use case for deploy keys are if you're using let's say a build server or a c cicd thirdparty service that needs to clone the repo so they can perform a build or deploy or maybe single repo access so instead of using a shared key pair for the uh for multiple repos you have a single key pair for a single git uh git repo and another reason would be to avoid using the personal access token um I'm going to tell you I've definitely used deploy Keys especially if you're not using GitHub actions and you're using thirdparty cicd tools which is pretty common with GitHub um you will find yourself using deploy keys and I just want to make a wear that's very similar to the other one with some advantages so you have to decide in your use case where you're going to want to use it but it's as simple as that okay hey this is Andrew Brown and we are taking a look at personal account access tokens or specifically personal access tokens or Pat which is an alternative way of using a password for authentication now PS are not specific to GitHub but they do utilize them uh and the purpose of these tokens is to give you access to the API um when you're making direct calls or using the command line or using the SDK uh GitHub no longer supports the use uh of using a password directly with interacting with API they used to but now you have to use an access token uh if you're coming from like the adus world it's kind of like your access secret um so it's giving you that access uh there are two types of pths on um GitHub you have the classic token they are less secure and no longer recommended for use customers with Legacy systems may still be using the classic token like some of my apps uh then you have fine grain personal access tokens these Grant specific permissions they must have an expiry date uh you can only access specific repo um or if you want all repos it'll probably only be readon you can only access resources owned by a single user or organization you can find the stuff under the developer settings um there are a few use cases where we'll use uh Pats it'll be like logging in using git clone for HPS and uh let's say we are using uh the GitHub CLI you could set a token or sorry a environment variable called GH token to be used uh for for the GitHub CLI for the to pick that up uh if you're using SDK you're going to be supplying your token I would imagine that this uh that these um sdks would pick up that environment variable as well but there you go hey everyone it's Andrew Brown and this follow along I want to take a look at personal access tokens yes we've already played around with them but let's play around with them a little bit more okay and so what I'm going to do is go over to my repo and I might already have a code space from before and it's already still active so I'm going to go ahead and open that to save myself some trouble if you have to launch a new one you can absolutely go ahead and do that remember to close your codes places so you are not using up your free tear usage uh you get so many hours per month I don't know what it is uh you can look it up if you want to know or we'll find out when we make it over to the uh code spaces section in the course um and so what I want to do here is I just want to uh work with personal access tokens now we might have one set from before so I'm going to take a look here and see what we have so I'm going type in EnV grep GH and see if there's anything set and there's nothing set here so that's great and what I want to do is go to the top left corner here go to settings and then down below we'll go to our developer settings and we have our personal access tokens we have fine grain tokens and token classic now something I would like to know I'm going go ahead delete this one why I would like to know is can we generate them out from the GitHub CLI You' think you wouldn't be able to because then you need permissions to have permissions but I'm going to take a look here and see what we have have um because I'm just curious to see if it's actually there or not and so I'm going to just type in token and there is a token so it says the this command outputs the authentication token for an account on a given GitHub host well that's really interesting so what would happen if we wrote that in so I'm going to type in GH off token and see what we get and we actually get a token back so I'm not sure if that means that um that's that token code but let's find out if it is by generating out a new token another thing I might wonder is like what permissions do we have I'm not sure if it would tell us I don't think so what's refresh refresh our token expand or fix the permission scope of the store credentials that's kind of interesting like you go out and request to have more permissions but I'm not sure exactly how that would work um but let's go ahead and generate a new token I'll just say um create issues and I'm going to set this for one day okay and we'll go down below and we're going to select it for a very specific repo this one here and I'm going to go to permissions and I'm looking for issues we'll say yes to issues read and write and we'll go ahead and generate that token and so we can see that's what this token looks like we're going to copy it bring it over here and I'm going to set it to this so say GH token equals and then a double quotation paste it in enter and so now it should be set so if I type in E EnV grap uh GH we should see it there excellent so now let's type in Gs off token and see if we get a different value notice that this is the one we have now it shows that we're using a personal access token so this is getting load in loaded in by GitHub how it's getting in there I don't know but this one looks exactly to be the same as this one let's go test and see if we can make an issue so we go down below here and we will say create and I'll scroll down and grab example so we'll do this and hopefully it'll just know to create it in the current repo put enter and we need to set a default repo so we'll go ahead and do that I'll choose this one here and I'll try this again and so it's created it oh this repo has um issues disabled that's interesting so we'd have to go ahead and enable that so I'm going to go back to our repo here I'm going to go over to settings and we'll go down below and we'll turn on issues now we could do this via the CLI but it's just easy to checkbox that and we'll go back to our environment and we'll hit up and now it's created the issue so now the question is if I get rid of that token like I unet it uh what would happen so what I'll do is I'll just hit up till we get to that set and I'm just going to purposely set it blank okay and that way this shouldn't work work and so now if I do GH list issues list I wonder if I can get a list of them now remember this repo is public so it's going to work because it's public but the question is can I delete the issue so I'm going to say delete and um it's expecting some args if I type help will tell me how this works the number of it that's perfect so the number is two so that's easy and and I wonder if I could just put a two on this type two to confirm yes okay and deleted it now the thing is is that yes I was able to delete it but just understand that this thing has some base uh access underneath that original token and so it probably had permissions this one here to do that there's probably some things that this thing can't do and we learned that before which was that uh being able to create a repo um but uh you know if I did this on Local Host I would assume that this would have not worked and that's totally fine I think that satisfies us for learning about uh personal access tokens I'm going to go back to our personal access token go ahead and delete it and we'll call this one done okay so I'm going to go ahead and go into personal access tokens and delete this and if you want you can stop and delete your code spaces I'll see you in the next one ciao let's talk about the GitHub API and specifically what I want to talk about is the fact that there are two versions of it we have the rest API and the graphql API I'm not going to do a big lesson into what apis are and uh that kind of stuff but I want to give you comparison between these two to understand what are the pros and cons of each of them so let's do a breakdown quickly here uh so the first thing is the design philosophy so for the rest API this is resource base and this is uh this means that usually with rest apis you'll have a different endpoint per resource uh for graphql you'll have a single endpoint with queries for precise data requests um for methods we can use get post put delete um but for graphql they usually use post for data fetching we can have multiple requests for related data for graphql you use a single single request that can be very complex but you get whatever you want uh you can have over fetching or under fetching for graphql you you have precise data fetching so you're getting exactly what you want and nothing more for performance it is less efficient for complex systems but you know what I think that is something we could argue because I still really like rest apis for graphql uh it's more efficient for complex queries for caching it's easier due to HP methods um for graphql it's more challenging due to post methods the learning curve it's super easy as rest apis graphql uh requires a lot more knowledge to pick up um for rest API it's server driven structure for graphql it's client driven okay for versioning you often have to do API versioning for rest API for graphql usually don't have to that was the huge reason for having graph graphql apis the ecosystem for rest API is mature with extensive tools graphql is still growing but uh the point is is that GitHub has both and these are the two big flavors of apis on the internet um and I think the major reason they did graphql was when they opened uh the G ithub App Store so you get exactly the data you wanted because the rest apis didn't always return the data uh that that people needed to build apps and I think that was the reason why because I remember trying to build an app when the App Store first came out and I had to use graphql in fact I learned graphql because of GitHub uh because they're one of the early adopters of it when it came out but there you go hey this is angrew brown in this video I want to show you the GitHub API um you know there reason I know the GitHub API is because I've before GitHub actions and all this other stuff you would have to interact with a lot more I need to point out that there are two types of apis the rest API and the graphql API I wonder if it could give us an example of what that looks like for GitHub so you have an idea if you've never seen a graphql API um but uh let's see what we can find out so it looks like there might be some way to interactively explore it here oh there we go so graphql um it has it own syntax language and the idea is that you are formulating what data you want it'll turn it back so we can sign into this and then we could probably do some live stuff now I'm not saying I'm good at graphql but I'm sure we can figure it out so go ahead and authorize that and so here it says query viewer login so it looks like we already have some kind of query that's showing who is logged in um so what I would like to do is figure out how to query more stuff um and I'm going to go ask chat gbt because it's such a powerful tool and let's go ahead and figure this out so I'm going to go back over here and it uh we'll say write a graphql query that will return public repos uh for the uh named Ruby um for GitHub graphql API and let's see if it can do this this is a great feature if it can do this for uh this for us here because I do not like figuring out how to write graphql and so here is a query that is writing that we could possibly use okay I'm assuming that's part of the language those three hyphens and we'll go back or periods and we'll paste it in and see if it can work oh look at that okay it worked so there you go that is a way that we could use graphql graph is a lot more hard than just this because you actually have to have some kind of tool um or interface in order to utilize it but yeah it's as simple as getting the data back that you want there is public data and then there's data that needs to be authenticated you have rate limits for certain stuff so understand that you can't just get everything that you want let's go over to the rest API and I'm not sure if they there's ways to interact with it but sometimes what they'll do is they'll make it really easy for you to interact through here on the left hand side so if we went to issues and let's say we wanted to list things we might have some examples and we might be able to run them um so here you can see we have like the GitHub CLI but what we're really looking for is how do we do it raw like how can we do this um using curl or maybe even JavaScript but let's go ahead and do curl because that's more like API is and we'll have to open up a code space for this I think I already still have mine running again try to shut yours down as much as you can so you're saving money um I'm not worried about it I'm teaching a course I'm just going to expense it so understand that I'm a little bit more loose with this kind of stuff the question is will there be a curl command preinstalled In This Cloud developer environment sometimes they don't like like installing those in here for you but this one does have it so we'll go ahead and copy this command curl and we'll go back over here and we'll paste it in we'll hit enter now this isn't going to work because we didn't provide it an access token so let's go over I'm sure you know this by now we'll go over to our personal access tokens and get it going so all the way down to the ground developer settings personal access token find gr permissions create a token only issues uh issues so this is for rest API we're going to set this for one day that way if you forget it's not a big deal and we'll say for um all repos I guess it doesn't matter I'm going to go here and I want to grab oh we can't do it for that let's say all repos and I want issues uh read and write we'll generate that token out I'm going to grab this token I'm going to go back over to here and I need to kind of assemble it somewhere so I need a scratch Pad really quick just put that here I'll paste that in and what I'll need to do is just go above here and insert this I'll grab this paste that in here okay I'm going to cut this out and paste this back in so now we should be able to utilize this so let's see if that works copy paste and so we don't get any issues back now that doesn't mean that it didn't work it just means that there's no issues for it to find and we really don't have any issues so what I'm going to do is go ahead and create one just say uh my issue I think originally when you created issues you weren't able to delete them but now I think they've changed that and you can um so I want to try that again if I hit up will it bring the whole command yes it will and we're still not seeing anything now that doesn't mean that it's not working it's just that uh it's not getting exactly what I want back so maybe we can specify a very specific issue it says a list of assigned this issues assigned to the authenticated user now there's none assigned to us so let's go back and um assign it to ourselves okay so we'll try that maybe that will help we'll hit up and there we go so now we're getting data back and it must be that issue so that's all I really wanted to show you there we'll go ahead and delete this okay there's some way to delete this uh they really don't like you deleting them there it is down below in the bottom right corner and that's all I really wanted to show you for the apis but most of the time you're going to be interacting with some kind of CLI this is in JavaScript um or sorry SDK um but we'll we'll see that in the next video okay ciao let us take a look at the GitHub sdks and I told you octocat would make another appearance because their uh sdks are called octo kits these are the official sdks to programmatically interact with the git rest API and GitHub officially supports a few different languages so we have JavaScript and typescript c.net Ruby which is my favorite langu language so we're absolutely going to use that and terraform so here's an example of using terraform to uh create a repository as infrastructure is a code should you use terraform for uh GitHub for certain things yes like repos uh for other things like issues no but just understand that sometimes terraform gives you functionality uh that really shouldn't be used and it's up to you to figure out for your use case here's an example using Ruby and make note that we are passing the access token the the Pat Uh to the client um but yeah there we go hey this is angre brown and this follow along I want to take a look at the sdks so we can probably use Ruby and JavaScript those are both very easy to use uh so what I'll do is go ahead and launch my code spaces I already have one running uh you might have to make a new one you might already have one running make sure you don't leave them running because they do cost money and so it still has some stuff open from prior it probably still has the GitHub access token but what I want to do is go take a look here and type in GitHub sdks and we'll take a look at what we have because there's a couple that we have we have U Ruby JavaScript typescript c c um and they should be really easy to work with so I know they're called octokit so I'll just type in ocit GitHub and that probably will get us to the repo for all of them there we go and so we can get to our Ruby one o terraform let's do terraform and JavaScript let be too hard let's do terraform first because I I'm really excited to do that one and in order to do this we're going to have to have terraform installed so that's something that I I'm going to want as a feature um so for our Dev container we're going to have to get that feature installed and I'm not sure where we can find that so I'm very curious if like we get a list of features um list of Dev container features GitHub code spaces because there has to be one for terraform and so I'm just searching here for features available features here okay container Dev features that's how we found it and uh just because we're doing a little bit more here I'm going to go ahead and make a folder we'll just say sdks and I'm just going to say file new readme.md we'll go ahead and paste that on in here um and we'll just say we can uh install the following features into our codespace environment just called codespace and so what I'm looking for here is the terraform CLI so go ahead and do that and it's right here so I'll go ahead and grab that and we'll go back over to our Dev container and um I'll put a comma and we'll do this put colon c uh cures so that's that one uh while we're here I wouldn't mind Ruby do we already have Ruby installed let's go take a look type in clear Ruby they might already have it preinstalled in the base image uh if it is it shouldn't take that long to run it is okay so we don't have to install Ruby do we have node I think so yeah we do okay so we don't have to install that so really we just need um terraform now terraform uses get or sorry uh go but they're all compiled so I don't think we need to install go onto this image if we needed it so I want to get this terraform CLI installed so I'm going to go ahead say install terraform CLI we'll go ahead and Commit This and then what we're going to need to do is rebuild this environment so go down below go to command pallet I'm going look for rebuild um I don't know if we need to do a full or a whatever I'm going to do that one that seems fine to me let's go ahead and do that and I'll see you back here when this is done building okay all right so it rebuilt that was really slow but it is done so that is good um I'm not sure if we ran into any issues oh come on it's currently running recovery mode due to configuration error what do you mean to configuration error I did exactly what you told me to do it's like literally one line and I'm not allowed to do it okay so let's find out what the issue is um control shift p I do not like I do not like uh view code spaces okay let's find out what the problem is now we'll go down below um what's your problem it's not even like easy to find the problem here I'm just going to zoom out for a second so I can find it quicker okay looks fine finished error up here um Docker build fail to build okay but why it just failed to build no space left on the device well then how am I supposed to all right so I was hoping that we could install it that way if that's not going to work that's totally fine I'm just going to go ahead and comment that out okay so we can just do this for now and I'll take that out because I don't want to fiddle with this all day we can just install terraform CLI um the usual way okay I'm going type in clear and so I know it's in recovery mode I really don't care we'll just try try to proceed forward and do what we can so we'll go ahead and install the terraform CLI but you think with all that stuff it just work it would work right uh install and we're going to get started I just want the terraform CLI install instructions if we go here um we need Linux and we're choosing Ubuntu so we're basically going through all these commands it's that stupid gpg I really hope that we don't have to do that um I find that really frustrating so I'm not sure if I can work around that I think I have to get the dev container working let me go figure it out I'll be back in a second okay I'm not sure what would fix it but like this looks right to me I don't feel like we're doing anything wrong so what I'm going to do is I'm going to stop this workspace completely I'm just going to launch it again and see if we get any errors and we probably will don't have to fiddle around with it but uh I mean this is the experience of code spaces so I don't sure what uh why get would want us ever to use these things but I'm going to go ahead and delete this delete and I'm going to wait a moment here I'm going to go back here to our repo I'm going to try to launch it again I'm going to see if it makes any kind of difference okay we'll try this again if it doesn't work I'm going to just use git pod I'm I'm not even going to try with GitHub code spaces but we'll see if it builds okay all right so I'm back and I mean there was no error so maybe it did run out of space I'm not exactly sure how that works um I'm not sure why it would run out of space but that's totally fine I'm going to go ahead and open that up there and I want to see if terraforms installed so I'll type in terraform and it is so that is really good so in our um our SDK directory I'm going to just make a couple new folders so we'll have one for terraform we'll have one for Ruby and we'll do a very simple example with JavaScript as well okay we'll just say JS and so for our terraform one here I'm going to make a new main do TF file because that is how you create terraform and everybody should know terraform because it is a great thing to learn okay we'll type in clear I'll go into terraform here and the idea is that we will want to fill some stuff in so over here they're saying there is a terraform provider and the way that works is it will link over to the registry so um if we go here we'll get to the terraform registry for terraform we can get it on the homepage as well by just going to provider and there's probably one here for GitHub if I type in GitHub if it doesn't show up we could probably just search it um GitHub right and so they should have one I thought that'd be a lot easier to find but apparently not but that's okay we'll click back and I mean this is one way to find it and so the way you use a provider is you're going to grab this over here and we'll paste that into the top we'll say allow and what we have here is the required providers and then any kind of configuration in terraform they'll usually tell you how to configure that in the the first block here um and so I'm carefully reading here uh it looks like you could use a CLI to authenticate uh you can also pass in the personal access token this way as well so I'm hoping that it'll just pick up the CLI um so I think that's probably our best bet it already has a token technically installed whether it can create a repo is another story because we know we have to create separate tokens for that let's go on the left hand side to resources and there should be something here to create a repo or we could just create a branch and so let's copy this code and we'll go down here below and we'll paste it in and so we have to say what repo's for so this is for the GitHub examples and I want to call this Branch uh sdks okay so now what I can do is type in terraform and it and that'll initialize it then we can type terraform plan okay and it's saying that it's going to create this Branch looks good to me so now we'll do terraform apply I'm just going to type in Auto approve because I don't want to have to hit yes and uh otherwise we just say say yes or no it says that it created that Branch now it created this terraform lock file and some other files in here um I don't want this to junk up our um our repo so I'm making a do get ignore in here and we'll go to GitHub and we'll just say GitHub uh G ignore terraform and in here what we can do is just grab that uh terraform one here and this will make sure that we don't have all the junk that might get committed because we don't want to commit uh a bunch of stuff in here and so this is just going to make our lives a lot easier you can have get ignore files within subfolders so that's kind of interesting if we go back here now it's a lot cleaner that's totally fine let's go take a look and see if that Branch was created so if we go here and uh refresh making sure we're on ours and not the other one there it is okay great and so we can also tear that down so say terraform destroy Auto approve and so that was pretty nice there we go we'll go back we'll check to see if that branch is there it's gone excellent so now let's go ahead and do a ruby example so for Ruby um we need a two files we need a gem file I'll generate it out because I think that's a bit easier so we'll CD into that so say uh bundle a knit to create a gem file I always forget like these few lines here but I think their gem is called octo octo kit and it was their first gem so I like I'm really familiar with uh with that there and so we have that installed let's go take a look and uh at that CLI and see how that works um or sorry SDK so we have the Ruby one here I'm going to go over to this one and they should show some very simple instructions mhm uh they're not showing much but I'm going to go ahead and grab this one a lot of libraries especially in Ruby they'll they'll already assume that uh there's certain um tokens being set so I'm hoping that it'll just pick it up and we don't have to do anything fancy going to make a new file here called main. RB doesn't have to be called main it's just what I'm calling it and then the idea with the client is I want to go ahead and I want to uh try to create a branch so you know they might have like a a um a uh um documentation for that I don't want all this stuff I just want to get to it I want the manual so maybe if I go over here this is what I want and so what I'm looking for here is uh a way to connect or create a branch so I'm going to click on client again I've never looked at this in a long time so I'm just guessing but over here client has a bunch of uh things that we can do on it and so I mean there could be a method here so I'm just going to take a look here and see if we have like branch and it looks like we do I want to create a branch and I mean we do have methods here it says included in repositories so if I go over to this one here we go and I just want to create a branch and say create okay what if I search for create Branch create Branch I'm going try methods up here that might help create Branch I don't know why I can't find it I mean I can find branches it might be it might be the case that there is a thing for branches here there might be like an object for it and then we create off of it I mean I don't see one branches what the heck um I mean it's going to be something under repositories that's for sure so if I go to repositories they have an object here and it has to be something on here so if we carefully look we got Fork we got replace so yeah I'm not really sure so well if I don't know I'll go ask chat gbt and we'll see if they can make the code uh create a branch using the Ruby octokit for GitHub and let's see if it can do it but normally you know I would just go and look for it um but you know it's giving us a really hard time so I don't want to waste a lot of time here looking for it um yeah that probably would be one way to configure it okay that looks fine okay so you create a reference and I guess that makes sense because you're not actually creating a branch you're creating a reference to a a branch and then the branch gets pushed later so I suppose that makes sense um they do configure it up here again I don't know if we'll have to do that but it looks like this is what we're going to want to do here so I'm going to just grab this one I don't know if we need the shaw but I'll grab it anyway and I'm going to go back to this if you don't if you can't find this code I have this repo public so you can just grab it from here um and so it says get the latest Shaw from the base Branch so get the latest commit in main main being the base being the meaning that um and then we'll create a branch from it we'll need to specify our Branch name so we'll go back to this code here I'm going to grab these three lines because they look okay and I'll paste this up above and our Branch here is called I mean again it's going to be different for you but uh this will be Andrew Andrew WC Brown GitHub examples I just noticed that I named this with a lower H but that's that's okay um the branch name is going to be sdks uh the base branch is main must have been pulling from some really old code we'll save that I'm going to go ahead and type in bundle exec installed that's how we install ruby gems okay and it's saying missing file opend for install so maybe we have Ruby install but we don't actually we can't actually install anything so bundle install really oh no no sorry it's just bundle install I didn't mean to write exact that's why and then what we can do is type in exact Ruby main. RB and it should run uninitialized constant OCTA kit because we need to require it octokit we'll save that we'll go ahead and hit up and we ran into an error um it wants faray try to use the middle middleware faray so um install the faray retry gem I think faray is for like apis and then maybe retries like a variation of it I actually don't know but we'll just try this bundle I might install it there we go and we'll go ahead and try that again and now we have a 404 so OCTA kit not found and it's looking at GitHub examples for the commit sha on Main so it's using this path here I'm not sure if we could past that in like that this is not found commits so that's really interesting um I don't really understand why that's happening base Branch main main yep that's right did I spell this wrong at all maybe I did so we'll go ahead and hit up I forgot the S on it we'll try this again and now we'll see what it complains about um 404 not found Andrew WC Brown GitHub examples I really don't trust that I'm writing it correctly so I'm going to go down below here I'm going to grab this exactly and I'm going to go ahead and paste this in here exactly okay I'm going to double check my name make sure it's right Andrew Brown that's right and it looks good to me so I'll try this again still says 404 not found um okay I mean we could try and ask chat gbt maybe it's using like an old API uh one thing we could do is go back to the Ruby OCTA kit here and check the documentation okay okay and in here I'm going to go look under what am I looking for um just trying to find here it is uh this command here so this says create ref off of the client and to be fair like we did we didn't we didn't put in our token yet so that might still be an issue okay so it does have create ref on there and that looks fine okay this one says heads Master this one says ref heads main I don't know if that matters I'm going to take out the ref's part on it well maybe that one's fine back to this one creates ref heads Master for octocat Hello World um just to make this a little bit more clear I'm just going to take this out and and so we can simplify this we say sdks again we just want this to work and this is for this particular repo sometimes simplifying the code going to reduce our issues and I'm going to take this completely out here I want to grab the latest Shaw so if I go into to our commits over here and we're on Main we can go ahead and grab this code here and I'm just going to go ahead and replace it okay and so the idea is that this is going to just rule out a lot of issues that we're having okay and I want to bring this on down like this and so this is going to really simplify this one okay now again we haven't passed any tokens so that could still be our issue and it's still not working I can also take out heads here and see what happens if I do that and no luck so I'm going to go ahead and just take take take another look here GitHub um Ruby SDK create branch and also we could probably check this way as well because well they'll have the JavaScript version but maybe they'll have the equivalent for um creating uh for JavaScript we just look at the Ruby what's really bizarre is they don't have the Ruby example I think they used to but maybe they just stop doing that um get a branch rename a branch I want to create a branch work a branch merger Branch so I guess it's not really any of those and so I'm going to go back over here CU it it looked like it was more of a ref and on the left hand side we're going to look here in the API and try to find it um maybe repositories we'll click into repositories here no we'll click on this one maybe I type in ref create ref no we're not having a whole lot of luck here but hey we're learning about the apis and being able to navigate them that's got to count for something right because it's not going to be under refs pendency graph no actions no because that's going to be GitHub actions um commits no let me go fine I'll be back in a second okay okay all I did in Google type in rest API create ref and then I went to the first one and I think now we're in a good place and there is references it's under git database of all things that's a little bit confusing a git reference is a file that contains the get commit sha etc etc great so I want to create a reference here can I am I zoomed in oh that's why it's so hard to read I was super zoomed in we'll scroll on down here and we have create reference and so this is what I think that we're using right we're creating a reference we have owner repo but they don't have a good example for this so you know if this is not working what I'm going to do is copy the JavaScript one and then we'll work our way backwards to the Ruby one and see if we can get it to work okay so I'll go here I'll just say main JS okay I'll paste this on in here and um you know it's asking for the token again it should really load it in via the environment variables if it's not um I'm really surprised that it's just using a request and it's not using the SDK I don't feel like this is the right one I think this is not the SDK um so I'm going to go and type in octokit JS GitHub and I feel like we're going to get a much better way of interacting with it yeah this is going to make a lot more sense so in here yeah y okay here we go um so what I'll do is I'll go grab this line here that's why it's good to know more than one language because you can always work your way back and try to figure out what the problem is but it's showing octokit here so maybe it is actually using the kit right yeah it is okay so that code is using that U we don't need app apparently not sure what app is for but that's fine uh but I'm really surprised that we have to pass the token that way let's go take a look and see how we can authenticate um I was just like hoping that it would just pick it up by default but I'm not sure about that here they're talking about RB like uh octokit RB um actually this is the Ruby one again so I'm on the wrong page back into this one and yeah meant to be over here I'm looking for Authentication here it is yeah I'm not sure how it picks it up well I guess we'll bring in the token then um what I'll do is I is I'll have to bring in a token so we'll go here we'll go to settings and maybe that would fix the Ruby one maybe that was the Ruby problem the entire time I'm going to go ahead and drop this down find grain permissions I'm delete this old one I'm going to create a new one and I'm going just say uh create Branch just really creating ref that's what we're actually trying to do I'm going to go ahead and go to the next one here and we'll say for select repos this will be for our only repo and we need to go through permissions so I'm looking for references ref database API like where would this be would it be under repositories so I'm going to choose this one I'm going to choose the repo one if I can find it oh it is that one right there read and right um maybe this one because that's repo creation commit statuses I'm just kind of picking a lot so we have a good chance of this working I'm going to go count permissions um don't think I need any of those so I think that's fine I'm going to go ahead and generate this token out I'm going to grab this token go back over to our environment and I'm going to go ahead and set this as export GH uh token and then we'll go ahead and paste this in and do that we'll type in clear we'll do GP EnV GH to make sure that we can uh find that there oh I got that backwards EnV grap GH the token is set and so what I want to do here now is make sure it gets picked up I'm going to test the Ruby one here and just see if it if it makes a difference and uh it does not another thing I might try is go back in here and explicitly set that token I believe we can set that as access token and I can say EnV GH token and so that would be a very explicit way to get it I'll hit up again oh there's no problem now okay so maybe it was a token the entire time like that was the issue so what I'll do is I'll go back over to our repo again that was all just guesswork you know you got to have confidence you got to try things and I'll go over here and drop it down and there it is so that definitely did work um I don't want this Branch right now so I want to go ahead and delete it we can go to our branches here and I'm going to go ahead and delete this branch and I want to delete it again I just want it gone it's gone I think and so now we have our Ruby one working so now we need to get our JavaScript one working and it wants a token as well the way we bring in environment variables is a little bit different um it uses like process so it' be like import process I always kind of forget maybe we don't have to import anything at all um we'll say reference a nvar or like call an nvar in nodejs file example yeah it is processed but do we need to import it uhhuh so I'm thinking maybe we don't need to even import anything for it I'm going to go ahead and try this uh we'll go back over here I'm just going to paste this in GH token and so I'm not confident whether it's getting imported or not so what I'm going to do is do a console log that should print out the token token dollar sign uh or maybe it's back tis I know a lot of languages so I get confused easily um okay so that's in there like that um so here we have the reference it looks like these repl these place holders so we'll have to specify the owner I'm the owner so this is going to be um Andrew WC Brown we'll need to have the shaw so I'll go back over here and grab it from here okay and we'll paste that in this is going to be sdk's I'll put JS so we really sure we know what we're using here uh the repo is going to be GitHub examples okay okay and I'm going to make my way over to that directory uh for JavaScript now I'm going to want the get ignore for JavaScript in particular get ignore JavaScript I didn't do it for Ruby because Ruby doesn't really make that much junk files so it wasn't a serious issue but if you really wanted to you could go ahead and and um grab it if you wanted so go ahead and grab that and we'll go back over here to here we'll say dog ignore and if anyone's wondering I'm like watch watching when my test is going to come up here so I'm just kind of getting nervous uh not because the test is hard I just want don't want to forget about and then miss uh sitting the GitHub foundations certification course so that is now in there so that won't dump a bunch of junk files in when it adds that I want to add that right away so add the G ignore sometimes it won't take effect unless you add it right away I know I spelled that wrong I don't care um and so I'm going to go and type in mpm install I'm going to imagine that this is OCTA kit as well it has to be CU it was called octokit JS sometimes like the files might be a little bit different like octokit hyphen period JS or JS after it I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to do an mpm install oh it's already installed but and so what we'll do is go over here and take a look and we now have a package Json and I want to run as I don't know why I didn't put it in here but I want to have a script in here I'm going to go ahead and just type in mpm init because it really didn't give me a whole lot I really don't like that I didn't get stuff here and so it overwrote it and I'm going to just install it again and that way I don't have to fiddle with it so much so now I have the scripts and I can just say start and what I'm going to do here is just say um node main JS okay and so now put a Comm on there we should be able to do mpm uh start and that should try to run that screen R um it didn't like the import for some reason to load es module types um you have to load something something so I think it's just the style that we're using there that's totally fine I'm going have to go to the top here and change this to be require I guess um we'll go back to our JavaScript here we going to go all the way to the top and I need a different way to import it um this one is what we want it could be the node version that's installed here but I really don't think that's the case but I'm going to go ahead and do that that's easy enough to fix and we'll hit enter and a weight is only valid in async functions at at and the top level bodies of modules okay I mean I really don't care if it's a uh async can I just take it out will that work the token printed out that's good um we'll go back over here see if our Branch created just Refresh on branches it did perfect great so now that means we can go ahead and Commit This just double triple check your files make sure you're not committing anything you're not supposed to commit don't commit your token go ahead and Commit This I'm just in a hurry for my exam and we'll just say SDK stuff SDK GNA go ahead and commit that I'm going to say okay sync sync sync I'm going to go back over here I'm going to switch accounts I'm in a big hurry uh you know stop your code spaces don't waste your money and um I'm going to go over to our repo here um and I actually want to be in an exam Pro one exam proo exam Pro Co okay I'm G to make a new PLL request I want to merge um compare across forks and I want to grab this one and bring it over into that one boom just sdks sdks I really shouldn't be silly like that you should take take time naming your pull requests and wait a moment merge it we're done I'll see you in the next one ciao hey it's Angie Brown and we are taking a look at GitHub desktop so this is a standalone application to interact with GitHub repos without the browser or via code and it can do common git and GitHub operations that you can perform via the guei for an easy to ous experience it works for both Mac OS windows and Linux so yeah it's a very useful tool um you know when you look at git as uh a thing that you can use a lot of times there are these other kind of um Standalone applications specifically around get to make git actions easier but this does two things it does git and GitHub so if very powerful if you are using the GitHub platform so I recommend you give it an install okay hey this is Angie Brown and this follow along I want to take a look at installing GitHub desktop and see what we can do with it so what I'm going to do is open up a new tab and just type in GitHub desktop and we'll find our way over there so here it is uh at desktop. github.com and we can go ahead and proceed to install this so I'm on Windows right now so I'm going to go ahead and just just download that okay all right so that's finished downloading let's go ahead and install it so it should be pretty straightforward going to double click the executable if you're on Mac of course you drag into your applications for Linux I have no idea but imagine it's not too hard to install and I'm just waiting for it to um uh uh pop up here and proceed with installation so you can see my computer is thinking there we go it's starting to open up all right so we'll wait for that to finish its install there we go looks like it's installed we can log in either into github.com or GitHub Enterprises let's go ahead and uh log into github.com you can see we can sign into uh either or I think I'm interested right now in this repo here so I'm going to select this one and we'll go ahead and authorize it um and it says when your phone is ready click the button below so I'm going to use GitHub mobile to confirm because we have UFA so just give me a moment and while I'm waiting here I guess I have to press press the button I wasn't doing that and so it pops up with 14 and um I have a pseudo request and so I'll just share my screen here for just a moment but what it's showing me here is I have to enter those two digits in so that's what I mean where sometimes it it uh pops up or other times it's just confirmation it's going to really depend on the action that's being performed let's go ahead and open this up in GitHub desktop and we can see it's setting our name and email so it's like it's it is configuring get underneath um so that is interesting there we'll go ahead and uh click finish and I mean we got tutorials and other stuff here but I'm not really interested in that I just want to open up the repo that we already have let's go ahead and open that up and I guess we're cloning it and it's actually showing us that we're going to clone it in a specific location here it's putting in documents GitHub I guess that's fine uh we go over to GitHub github.com I suppose we can just select the repo and it'll put the path there so there's two different ways that we can do it here I'm not sure which way is better but I'll go ahead and do uh this method here because it just seemed a little bit simpler and so now we have our repo pulled up and so we can perform stuff here um so you uh you have changes on this Branch would you like what would you like to do with them uh to contribute them to the parent project um I I don't know I just I just opened it up why am I already getting to asked questions you have changes on this Branch would what would you like to do with them to contribute to the parent project for my own purposes this will help you contribute to this repo I guess the top one maybe it's just trying to tell me what I want to do or not do I'm not exactly sure um but now we have this opened and so the idea is that if we make changes we can do something in here looks like we can also open up our repo directly here in Visual Studio code so I can go ahead and click this I guess the nice part of this is that I don't need to have any compute attached um in order to work with this so normally you have to have get installed here and just say I accept this and so we could go in here I'll go into our crash course here I'll just add another exclamation mark if it ever lets me here good I'll just say save and I'll go back over to here and it shows that we have a change uh let's take a look at history so we have um history over time I would really prefer a graph I'm not sure if they actually have like a graph mode in here so this isn't like super useful a lot of other uh git programs like there's one called cracken like get Kraken um they say it's a legendary tool I think it's a little bit heavy but the point is is that they will have a much better visualization in terms of what is going on so you know this tool is okay but it's not the best tool you can create uh you can push pull fetch you can view stuff here you can open up the command prompt um so there are some things you can do you can do stuff with branches um but it's really up to what workflow you're working in because of course you know if you're already using visual studio code you don't really need this tool because we can do uh everything and much more here and then there's also a GitHub plugin that we can utilize so um you know GitHub desktop existed before Visual Studio code and before the visual studio code extension so um you know it's there and you know maybe if you're using a different editor or or maybe you couldn't install the extension or something like that there' be a use case for GitHub desktop again it's not bad but um you know it is it is what it is uh it is very good at keeping uh your repos in a particular location and managing managing them so that is really good there but again why they haven't added a visualization I have no idea but there you go that is GitHub desktop um as far as as much as we want to cover it here and we'll see you the next one ciao let us compare the difference between github.com and GitHub desktop for the following uh comparisons so let's start at the top here so for github.com it is a webbased interface access via the browser the GitHub desktop is a standalone desktop application for accessibility the github.com is accessible anywhere there is internet and the GitHub desktop is only where you install it on your computer for repo management it directly manages repositories online for GitHub desktop it manages repos locally for basic git operations github.com performs operations like Fork start and watch GitHub desktop um simplified interface for commit pull uh push and so notice it says Fork star and watch those aren't really git operations those are GitHub operations I just want to clarify that um for collaboration direct collaboration tools like issues and PRS focuses on local repo management um then for Advanced GET features supports Advanced features via commands simplified experience for basic features integration tools integrates with various online cicd tools and limited to local get tools so these are not like hard rules for all of them but um it's just a general distinction between the two but there you go GitHub mobile is a mobile application you can install on iOS or Android phones to perform readon basic GitHub repo management tasks it can manage triage and clear notifications read review collaborate on issues and PLL requests edit edit files and PLL requests search for browse and interact with user repos and organizations receive a push notification when someone mentions your username search through codee in a specific repo secure your github.com account with two Factor authentication and that is the primary reason I tell you to install it is for that as it I find it very useful verify your signed in attempts on unrecognized devices GitHub mobile can be used for UFA which is a convenient way over other methods and I definitely agree with that for everything else you know I'm not really sure I think the thing about this particular product um and I really should have highlighted this is it's really good good for triage and people that need to stay um uh stay up to date with what's going on so people that maybe they a sis Ops administrator or something like that um so GitHub mobile becomes very very important and um even though it doesn't show up in the exam it's in the exam guide outline they really want you to know about mobile notifications to stay on top of stuff so we'll look at that next okay let us take a look at mobile notifications on GitHub just understand that these are the settings on Android I have no idea what they are for iOS maybe they're different maybe they're the same I would imagine they're the same but different UI but we just want to make sure we cover our bases because the exam guide outline wants us to know this probably for people that try to triage things when issues happen in GitHub so let's quickly look at it so you can set push notifications you want to receive so we can say direct me mentions review requested assigned deployment review pull request review and workflow runs uh you can set the working hours to only receive push notifications for specific periods of time so that way you're not getting annoyed when it's your weekend or it's your time off um you can set swipe options on notifications to perform save Mark is read Mark is done or unsubscribe so you can go left or right on that um you can change the app style notification this might be specific to Android but making sure that you can see the type of alert you want to see so it grabs your attention so you jump on top of it and there you go let us take a look at the types of GitHub accounts we've got three personal organizational and Enterprise so for personal accounts these are individual accounts with a username and profile they can own resources like reps and projects and actions are taken uh based on the personal account they can either be GitHub free and GitHub Pro which we will definitely describe in this section of the course then you have organization accounts I said organizational above organization can just think of them as the same thing whichever language you want to use shared accounts where we have multiple people collaborating on projects they can own resources just like uh just as the personal account has um and these are generally managed through individual personal accounts I say generally because um when we were going through setting up our organization we have the option to convert our personal account into some kind of business um so we didn't go through that and generally I've always known this to be through personal accounts the exam is not going to test you either either way but I just want to point that out organizations offer different roles with varying levels of access and cons security features those roles are predefined um if you want more flexible custom roles you'd have to have Enterprise for that Enterprise accounts so this is part of the GitHub Enterprise cloud and GitHub Enterprise server these accounts allow for Central management of multiple organizations they're geared towards larger setups needing centralized policies and building management or if you have to have internal G uh GitHub repos which is a a specific type of GitHub repo specifically for Enterprise the exam surprisingly for me ask a lot of Enterprise specific questions which I don't really think is fair for the GitHub foundation so I'm just telling you up front you're going to have to remember some factoids for Enterprises if you want to max out your points on the exam let's take a quick look at GitHub personal and organizations before we move on here so as you can see you get a profile if you look at the top right corner it is based on your username so github.com uhen King there and if you had a repo the repo is going to have uh your your your username followed by the repo name okay for organizations it's very similar it also has a public profile page uh it also has a username and um it's not it's not exactly the same but it's the same concept but it's going to follow the same pattern for uh repos so repos can either have an org name or a username okay so there you go all right let us compare GitHub free versus Pro and I just want to warn you that the exam might ask you one of these things so it becomes a little bit more important to remember the differences between them is it fair for an exam not really but it's just how they made their exam so I just want to point that out that you have to remember some fact total information here so we have GitHub free and GitHub Pro so let's go through the GitHub free features you get GitHub Community Support dependabot alerts deployment protection rules for public repos two Factor authentication enforcement 500 megabytes of GitHub packages storage 120 g uh GitHub code spaces core hours per month 15 uh gigabytes of GitHub code spaces storage per month GitHub action features such as 2,000 minutes per month deployment protection rules for public repos I'm not sure why it's listed under there because that makes no sense but that's where they put it and so basically um in GitHub Pro you get everything you get in free with addition of GitHub support via email 3,000 GitHub actions per uh minute per month so extra thousand two gigabytes of gig GitHub GitHub packages storage 180 GitHub code spaces core hours per month 20 Gigabytes of GitHub codes spaces storage per month Advanced tools and insights in uh private repos you have required pull request reviewers multiple pull request reviewers protected branches code owners automated link references GitHub pages wikis and repo insights graphs if you don't know what all this stuff is right now do not worry because we're covering basically all of it like working with all these tools and then you should come back and uh review this again so you have it for your knowledge when you take the exam okay ciao for GitHub organizations there are three type of plans we have free teams and Enterprise I put an aster there because this is more an upsell to the Enterprise um uh uh account uh but when you go and you try to buy it will show you their the Enterprise option so just pointing that out let's talk about free so you get everything that was in GitHub free with the addition of Team access controls for managing groups 2,000 GitHub action minutes per month 500 megabytes of GitHub packages uh storage um and I don't really understand those last two because it is it for the org or is it for the personal account that has the org but it's in there okay then we have teams and this is where we start paying everything from GitHub org in the free edition with also GitHub support via email 3,000 GitHub actions minutes per month 2 gabt GitHub package storage Advanced tools and insights in private repos required pole request reviewers multiple poll request reviewers and notice that the minutes for GitHub actions and packages look very similar to um the pro PL Pro account for the GitHub uh personal Pro and there is more so let's keep going uh we have draft pull requests team pull request reviewers protected branches code owners schedule reminders GitHub Pages wikis repo insights graphs the option to enable or disable GitHub code spaces um one thing I'd like to point out is the code owners because that is quite a unique feature we'll talk about that when we get to wherever that is in the course um but I think that one is one worth remembering out of the teams functionality also draft PLL requests I try to remember those two in particular as those are very specific and unique features and and they both showed up on my exam so just make a note of that okay all right let's take a look here at GitHub Enterprises deployment options because they have two kind that you can have uh we have GitHub Enterprise Cloud this is when you want to have a hosted version of the Enterprise Edition on github.com and then you have GitHub Enterprise server this is a uh selfhosted one so let's take a look at uh what have our deployment options in terms of feature set on the GitHub Enterprise for both cloud and server they're going to share this same functionality first so first of all they're going to have everything that organization teams has but they're going to get GitHub Enterprise support they're going to get additional security compliance deployment controls authentication with saml uh single signon um and accessing Provisions provisioning with saml and S cim they make a large emphasis on this in the exam in fact I totally thought it didn't matter and then I got a bunch of questions on the sum exam and I was like really but yeah I'm going to have to make a couple slides on that in our Enterprise section because they really want you to know that that is an offering for Enterprise um deployment protection rules with GitHub actions for private or internal repos and that again is a feature specific to Enterprises so make note of that as well we have GitHub connect Actually I don't even know what that is um I'll have to I guess make a slide on that as well option to purchase the GitHub Advanced security so that is a um some kind of additional feature for specific features we have 50,000 GitHub action minutes per month 50 gigabytes of GitHub packages storage a service level agreement of 99.9% monthly up time option to centrally manage policies and building for multiple github.com orgs with an Enterprise account this was a question on my exam as well and I was not prepared for it um they never asked for like minutes I think that's kind of information I never saw that there so you don't have to really worry about that we have options to provision and manage the user accounts for your developer by using the uh emus um I'm glad we never had any questions on of those but uh emus seemed like they're really involved but I imagine that would be in that GitHub administrator um or Administration or administrator certification but there you go so before we can talk about what markdown is we need to know what the markup language is so a markup language I shouldn't said the but it's a markup language is a way of formatting and presenting Text data in a different format and a common use case for a markup language is to present data in HTML and so uh probably the one that won out the battle for HTML uh formatting language is markdown so markdown is a markup language that provides a shorthand syntax to format information into HTML markdown is popular due to its easy syntax and being readable in its raw format I want to point out that on the exam they might ask you about markdown and they might throw in markup in there to confuse you remember down down down down mark down okay um in terms of file extensions you have MD and markdown I've never ever seen anyone ever use the ladder it's always been MD but just be aware they are both there so let's take a look at what it looks like the idea is you write your mark down it looks like that and from there we're going to get HTML and that HTML can be rendered as a preview so the idea is that we need to learn and everyone should know how to do this not just in GitHub but everyone should know how to write markdown because it's super useful as a developer tool as a Tech Tool in general okay let us take a quick look at the markdown base basic syntax and so all markdown parsers support uh this basic syntax when we talk about parsers that's a program that knows how to take markdown uh the raw markdown format and spit out HTML and there can be variations between the parsers because there's implementations in different languages for different use cases so understand that uh your markdown might not be the same as someone else's markdown in terms of what will work and not work um but we have headings so that's just your standard headings you have text formatting like size and bolx some of some of the time boltex can be underscores instead of double uh asteris why um they made a tal size single asteris I have no idea as a lot of people think that it's the single asterisk but that's just what it is for Block quotes that's like an indented um uh uh text usually for quotes uh we have unordered list so you just put um hyphens in the front it'll they'll put bullets there for ordered list you can keep all the numbers the same so 11 one and it will then render out as 1 2 3 4 which is really nice uh that is for a link that is for an image very similar to link but has an exclamation mark in the front of it you have the horizontal ruler or Rule and then you have inline code I need to really point out that that is using a back tick so when you're doing code blocks they always use back ticks for um for markdown okay so that is the basic syntax and there you go let us take a look here at markdown extended syntax so this will be supported by some parsers if not most um and the most common one is being able to make a table these are not fun to make but at least we can do them uh we have fence code blocks this is when you want to have multiline code and the really nice thing is that you can actually apply uh for a lot of these um the name of the extension which will provide some synta tax highlighting this is something GitHub absolutely does and you should do it if you have the option to do so because it makes things so much easier to read we have footnotes we have heading IDs which I've never used before we have definition lists which I've never used before we have strikethroughs highlight which I've never used before might be fun to try that out emojis which I love and GitHub has great support for and we have task list which um GitHub this this one's a really useful one then we have subscript and superscript and I've used those in a few cases but uh yeah there you go that is the markdown extended syntax so in GitHub when you ever have to write something that is markdown supported it's going to have this text formatting toolbar and it allows you to uh utilize GitHub flavored markdown syntax which we'll talk about in the GitHub flavored markdown syntax section and it appears right here and so the idea is that you can uh press these buttons and it's going to make your life a lot easier you also notice that a lot of times you'll have a preview as well so that uh makes it very easy to turn that raw markdown into uh the final product the HTML rendered in terms of what it'll look like to the end user um and so I find that super useful okay let us take a look at slash commands so these are uh functionality at least within Comon boxes that allow convenience features such as formatting markdown and I'm implying that there could be other functionality but right now it only does a markdown and it's a beta feature oddly enough even though it's a beta feature it appears on the exam because GitHub apparently puts beta features in their exams which I think is bizarre but whatever so let's say you wanted to create a table you basically get this wizzywig and you go through it the idea is that you can put that forward slash to start triggering that um line of prompts and it can make your life a lot easier and actually it is a good idea but um again you know beta feed feature probably shouldn't be an exam but hey that's how GitHub rolls okay let us take a look here at GitHub flavored markdown also known as gfm this is a dialect of markdown that is currently supported for user content on github.com and GitHub Enterprise gfm provides powerful functionality such as collapsible sections embedded mathematical Expressions embedded diagrams relative paths or linking to files in the same repo task lists that can be converted into issues extended formatting for tables short hands to autol links to issues pull requests and repos render code Snippets from other code bases via linking and more um and we can see the whole detailed spec at gfm spec uh website here so that's at github.com gfm it's a really good read and I'm being sarcastic because it is very dry but let's take a look at the functionality we're listing here on the left hand side so you have a really clear idea what you can do so the first that I think is really cool is having um better syntaxes or sorry a control over your tables so here you can actually have embedded syntax within the table cells which is not a normal thing you can usually do with markdown another thing is more uh control over the look or formatting of your table so you can better align that stuff I imagine that they have like merging cells and uh excluding the headers I think that they have that but um these are the two that I could remember that are a big deal um they have this details tag and this allows you to have collapsible sections uh it has support for mermaids so this allows you to render things like um uh dags di acrylic direct acrylic graphs it's just a type of graph okay um we have geojson and too Json this allows you to create interactive maps so here's an example of geojson and then here's an example of too Json I imagine that they render a bit differently so one might be better than the other in terms of information shown then we can uh render 3D models so that's kind of cool um it can render mathematical expressions and I really know latex I used to work for a math educational startup and so you have your double dollar sign for your latex or you can use uh fencing blocks code blocks and have math this is using math Jacks so if you're wondering what implementation that's what it's using and so those will both render out the same thing based on what syntax you want to use um if you have links it'll automatically be linked that's not like a GitHub specific thing but it is something that um they have set their defaults for their markdown to do but what is really interesting are these quick links so the idea is if we do pound 26 or GH hyphen 26 it'll create hyperlinks and these hyperlinks will go to issues which is super useful um might go for poll requests as well because they usually treat the numbers as the same so like if you make an issue one and you make a pull request the next ID will be two in your project if that makes sense within comments you can quickly link to other repo so if you have something that looks like a repo it's going to go to a repo uh that would be the final product uh produce there and then you can also link Things based on um commit Shaws so yeah a lot of cool linking um Tas list can be uh can with uh can be op can be turned into open issues kind of wrote that a bit weird you can associate tasks to specific issues creating basically subtasks GitHub can keep track of your open or closed state of linked issues you can on click turn a task and associate with an issue so here is your usual task list but notice there's like little icons and stuff um and you can also reorder them so a lot of great additional functionality that is on the rendered side or on the markdown side that is new um but yeah that is gfm you should know some of the stuff because it really does make it a lot easier to work on GitHub but there you go ciao all right so in this fall along what I want to do is get some practice with markdown there's a few ways that we can uh work with markdown here um we could uh edit files in line we could use GitHub dodev we could open up code spaces but I just want to show you um you know a few things that we can do here so maybe what I should do is go over to our new repo GitHub examples and we should try to uh utilize um some of the abilities of creating stuff without opening up an editor because I know the exam they might ask you that and so I figur a little bit of practice with that would be good so let's say we want to make a new folder here what we can do is we go ahead and add a new file and we will create a new file and in order to create a a new folder all we got to do is type A for slash I'm going to say markdown uh here and put a for Slash and now we have a folder and we now have ourselves a readme file now I didn't mean to hit forward slash there I think it just happened prematurely so I just hit backspace I can type in MD and notice right away that we can start writing markdown okay so we can go here and flip between them they really want to use copilot I do not care about copilot and I'll go ahead and just say U mark down uh mark down examples and what we'll do is work through some here so again I'm just going to show you that you can commit uh this but let's make a list of things that we should learn how to do headings we should know how to do uh and I'm already writing markdown as a list headings uh unordered lists we should have ordered lists um uh formattings like uh text formatting code uh tables Auto links lists um we could also have like images links images okay so that's a pretty good list of things that we can learn how to do and I think that's a good start so let's see unordered list I'm going to go ahead and commit that change so I just want to show that you can commit directly with files and update files here and that's really really nice and you can see that stuff rendered in place but I think what's going to make this a lot easier to work with is to uh use that github.io so if we press in Period what that's going to do is open up github.com which is not a thing I hit period but it didn't do anything I hit period again and I think it had to like move or something there and now it's going to open open it up in github.com okay so let's go through and figure this out so the first thing are headings so this is a heading up here this is a heading one if we can go we do this this is heading one and now we'll just do heading two headings and I feel like we already kind of figured that out because we're we're doing that so I'm not sure if we really need to have that as we know what headings are so we'll say unordered lists and we'll just uh say unordered lists yeah we can create unordered lists in markdown using hyphens okay and while we're doing this let's open up uh GitHub flavored markdown because maybe there's some things that are there that might be interesting to take a look at so I'm going to go ahead and grab this link I'm going to dump it in remember that just Auto links as soon as we paste it in here and if we go here we could see that there is a bunch of stuff so there could be something for lists I'm not seeing anything for list I can type in list here lists container blocks lists um notice they have a minus or a plus so looks like that breaks it up into separate ones so we can give that a go let's just go ahead and copy these and take a look at what we get so we do this and that will treat this as two separate lists I guess we can have pluses or minuses didn't know that that's cool again these are extensions to uh the regular one and then we can have our unordered list or sorry ordered lists okay so it's interesting that you know you can do one two and then have three but notice if you repeat three multiple times it'll increment from there and it starts from where it incremented um so I think that's really cool you can also just have them all the same number if you want so you don't have to really worry about that but that's a nice way of splitting again never knew that because I never bothered opening this up till now um so there's that uh let's go take a look at uh text formatting so we have let's say bold so if we are supposed to do italics first so italics is going to be this okay scrolling down so we can see it bold just going to do that every single time e bold can be this doubles and see how like formats it as well so you can kind of have an idea you can also probably do bold with underscores I think apparently that does a tal size I guess you can do one or the other so I was kind of wrong but I guess we could do it this or that way not all markdown um parsers do that though some might treat um underscores exclusively as a bold so understand that let's try strike through strike through we have to use doubles for some reason there we go does markdown give us anything or gfm does it give us anything fun we'll go all the way to the top here um characters and lines apparently apparently pays attention to tabs that's cool um yeah not exactly sure but maybe there is something else there some inline stuff so that's fine uh we'll go to the next one we have code so for code here we'll say code what we'll want to have here is stuff like um backtick so we might say um something as like puts hello Ruby so that's how you say that's how you print in Ruby hello world notice that it has this interesting formatting so it's different from like whether we were to bold so if we were to do the same thing it wouldn't be really the same thing right if we did this in bold that's great but take out the back ticks but like this is a lot better when you have something inline so you can print to the terminal using the command so that's really good when you want inline code so say like inline code multiline code so here I could do triple back ticks it will say without highlighting with highlighting okay so we'll say something like defa hello world and puts hello world I'll copy this I'll bring this down here we'll do RB and so notice this one's highlighted and this one's not so really try to do those High highlights as you can um I think they say like what it's using underneath so there's probably I can't remember what it is but uh they say in the documentation in the getting started like what syntax highlighting program they're using and so you can probably look up these codes but for the most part you can guess I don't know if like I typed in Ruby if that would still work as well it looks to be the same yeah it's the same so Ruby or the extension okay so there's that uh we have tables so we'll go down below here I really don't like making tables but we can try this here we use that text Toolbar to make it really easy but I'm not going to do that um so somewhere here should be tables tables tables tables tables tables tables tables just search tables here it is extension okay so some things are like clear extensions and other things are just like the settings they use as their default so go down here and so this is a basic table okay you always use three for this I'm not sure why but it's always three and you have to follow this format here's something that looks like more about um changing the alignment let's go here make sure we're at the right levels here um so maybe you don't have to have that so cells in one column don't need to match the length Okay so basically you can do whatever you want here and does it stretch it more if we go more no it doesn't so it's say it's one or whatever but standard markdown would only have uh three so that's uh like that's nice that you don't have to do exactly exactly three every time um so that's piped content okay that's fine I see something a little bit more exotic that's kind of interesting so I think it make an empty cell in this case I think I'm missing the one in the front here uh that didn't render out so despite it being in there oh you know this one's missing that's why it's getting confused and this one's missing what if I take this one out no this one just does not render so I'm not sure why they show that as an example because that doesn't render oh it will not be recognized okay I thought for some reason it would be like it leave an empty space let's try this one there we go so we have an empty space in this case but in this case it doesn't so I guess you have to have the full length and if there's one like if you don't have the full length of one then it won't work okay looks like we can just have a heading or is it a body yeah just the heading so I know there's more to it than that but um for whatever reason that's what it's showing up there we could take a look at block quotes um this is kind of interesting I've never seen that much for Block quotes before let's go block quote let so when you're doing like a quote for somebody or like you're making like a note so that's really interesting usually I would just do this like um uh the cloud is amazing right so you do that but here we're actually getting some different levels here I never knew you could do that let's try this block quote okay this one is similar wasn't super exciting there so so yeah that's interesting let's go back to our top we have um block quotes I can't spell block quotes this block quotes and I'll go all the way down to the bottom here or back to the top images images we'll do images and links this should really be over here so something we could do is if we wanted to make a link we could link um let's say we want to uh link this I'm just going to copy this here unordered lists and we could put squares around it like this okay and notice as soon as I hit pound this is specific to GitHub but it can link to the anchors that it sees on the page so if I want to link to this unordered list uh it'd be this right so this would map to that which is really nice so if I click that it would jump to that part of the page okay you can also do relative links to other stuff so if I had like um a file in here and I just say uh secret secret. MD uh we say this secret page if I spelled that right secret secet secret secret okay that other one looks right to me I can't really tell the difference um so you know like for links I just want to link to that so these links are going to be become very useful here in a second so say links so let's try this again Link Link Link Link Link we not have a heading for this yet so I go down here links all the way back to the top links and now I can just jump to that here on the right hand side and so maybe we want to go to that secret page so I'm going to do squares uh parentheses and this is going to be this part is the text I think um secret page and so this goes to the secret page so now what I can do is I could type in um trying to think how I do this real so now see how it's autoc comp completing so if I do this this will actually jump to that right so and I don't think you need that you probably do that as well it would still go there and so this is a great way to navigate around when you have a lot of pages again this is specific to GitHub um so other things might not do that uh we can just put a link out to anywhere here so let's say we want to do um something up to like github.com we say GitHub website and we just type type in htps Colon github.com if something looks like a link it will turn it into a link so that's really nice as well you might be fun to try out that repo thing remember the link and auto links so let's say we did uh issue one I wonder if it would render in here uh it didn't but you know this might be contextual based on where it is so this might only work in comments and I actually think that in my um my slide that's actually what it says is that U it should that it only works in comment so we might have to go test that out here in a moment um so is there anything else that we're missing we didn't do images usually you drag images in here and then they'll they'll they'll populate so I'll show that somewhere else but we'll consider this our markdown stuff here it'll say markdown examples okay the thing we didn't do was I think a list so if I did this I could say like item one can put a space here just say Tas Lisk um double here and say item one item two I'm not sure if it'll work here it's not rendering it that doesn't mean it's not working it just doesn't render here and so we'll go ahead and um just commit these changes make sure we get all of them so I'm just going to add this refresh got them all in here and we'll commit that so let's go take a look at some of the other markdown stuff that we're not going to see here um so what I want to do is go back to this repo so there's a link here I think codes spaces doesn't I think last time I was looking for and I couldn't find it and so what we might want to do is look at an issue and play around with Mark down here so we don't have any issues in this repo right now it's going to make a new issue um and apparently we can link to pull requests and other things like that so I might need to do a little bit more than just what we're doing here but anyway I'll just say um GitHub fun or sorry get or markdown fun learning how to use markdown and so what we could do here is make a list so let's try the forward slash because that's something they want us to know and I mean we could use this for a few different things adds a detail section to hide and show Stu that's kind of cool it drop that in there and we can just say my todo list apparently has a summary didn't tell us that before and go here see we have this nice drop down um I don't know if we need this interior P but what I want to do is make a list I could try doing forward slash to see what else we have here nothing really interesting you can seert issue templates that's kind of cool right there we'll look at that later but let's try to do this todo list because that's what I'm really interested in so I'll just say um we'll say lists and headings it's a little bit small I'll bump it up I'm sorry headings and bold and italics and we'll go ahead and submit that issue let's expand that notice that these are now uh we can sort and move this around and we can check these things off um it's probably possible for us to link issues to other issues I'm going to try to make another is again I don't know if this will work but I'll try it actually before we do that let's do it over here so let's say we want to do headings this used to be on the left hand side now they have it on the right whatever we'll click that and it should make a new issue okay so we do that and now it's being tracked I guess so we go over here let's see what happens if we close it say this is maybe we can reference this references um this one here notice that we have a link there for the repo I'm G to try this Andrew WC Brown and we'll say GitHub I'm going try to write it exactly the same here GitHub examples because they said that would link it didn't copyright we'll try that one more time do that again it really does not want to listen here we'll try this again GitHub example so I want to see what we're getting here so this isn't linking how I was hoping it would I mean it says in the docs you can so I'm not making things up here we'll just comment on that okay that didn't hyperlink interesting let's go take a look at that autolinks GitHub okay um this might have been in like gfm getting started I have to kind of remember where that is GitHub and we'll go to this here and I'm looking for where that could be um no no not this not this one um like they had like a getting started for GitHub flavored markdown here here it probably is there we go and so in here they should have things for like autol links I'm going grab this so we don't have to find it later on um I'm just going to modify the file so I have it go back over to our examples here and into our markdown and I'm just going to go ahead and edit this file in line because I'm only making one line change we could do a lot from just here but again it's a lot more um uh efficient to use github.io links links Auto links anyway I know that they're there because I took screenshots and I and like I wherever it was it's somewhere okay maybe it's like Advanced formatting that's probably what it might have been code blocks autol link references okay here we go so in here we should be able to link the repo reference type I didn't understand it over here oh maybe we got to put an issue afterwards okay so maybe we just can't link the repo by itself uh we're saying a very specific repo so I guess that is a minor mistake on my part let's go back to our issues okay good thing we always double triple check things if I go back to this then maybe I do pound and then four on this would that work there we go okay and then it shortens it and then we can see our todo list here can we check off from here that'd be cool if we could no but uh let's close this issue because what I want to see is does that close that thing out so we go over here and look it says one of four task completed which is really cool um so the question is if we were to check off all these things would this all be done this one this one this one there we go okay um so that's pretty interesting there's a lot of little markdown things that we can do um but I think that is sufficient uh and we have a good idea how to work with markdown um documentation is its own little skill so you know getting as much practice as you can is really great but I'll see you in the next one uh ciao let's talk about uploading files on GitHub because it's super easy the idea is that you can just drag them into any markdown box and it will generate out uh that image tag we didn't do it in the markdown section because I wanted to leave it for this but what it will do is it will have a placeholder and when it finishes it will then U place a link and basically GitHub is then hosting uh that file that you uploading in terms of what you can upload well there's a maximum file size of 10 megabytes for images and Gifts 10 megabytes for videos surprisingly I didn't know they could do videos uploaded to a repo owned by a user or org of a free GitHub plan 100 megabytes for videos uploaded to a repo owned by a user or org on a paid GitHub plan 25 megabytes for all other files um supported files would be PNG GIF jpeg um SVG log files markdown files Microsoft Word PowerPoint Excel text files PDFs Zips and video so there you go hey it's Andrew Brown and this fall along I just want to show you how to upload files very quickly when you in comments I don't know if this works in uh GitHub dodev I don't think so but in the comment boxes it absolutely will so what I'm going to do is go over to our issues and we're still learning how to use markdown I didn't finish that task and the idea is that we want to have some kind of image so basically what you need to do is download any kind of image I got an image on my desktop right over here and so what I'm going to do is drag it on in and I'm going to drop it in and notice that it's going to replace it with this link format and uh so if I go to preview you can see the images there it say simple as that so that's all I wanted to show you you can also go here and upload directly it'll open up you know your your downloads box but I don't really want to do that I just prefer dragging and that's it see you in the next one ciao hey this is Andrew Brown and let's take a look at the GitHub user profile so for personal accounts you get a GitHub user profile to Showcase yourself as a developer and that seems to be what they want the focus to be as as you uh start using it you kind of get that idea so here's an example of mine on my personal account and let's just walk through the features of this profile so we have a profile picture and bio uh that you can provide there um um notice that the bio is actually this little small tagline that's under your account right here uh we have user profile readme so that is this readme file over here that you can uh put whatever you like in it'll show it'll showcase your repos including the the ones that you've pinned as your favorite you'll have the contributors graph this is a graph displaying your contributors over the past year you might see an exam question on this I got one uh for contributors graph so basically what is it actually showing uh it has commits PLL request issues and cod reviews if you remember that stuff like what's in it then it'll be very easy to pick it out in a lineup you have followers and following so this displays the number of followers you have and the numbers of users you are following I didn't even know I had followers on GitHub but apparently I do you have stars so show repos you have starred we have organizations so list the GitHub organizations you are part of contrib contribution activities detailed list of recent activities on GitHub let's take a look at these features in more a closer view here um so the first thing is that big um uh profile read me and you can have your own all you got to do is create a public repo with the same username and uh the same username as the repo name and the user trying to get my pen tool out here that wasn't supposed to be uppercase you know PowerPoint likes to title titlee stuff all the time but you can see up here this is what it is and then I just have a read me and that's what it's rendering out um so that's pretty straightforward you can change uh your profile photo your display name bio URL in your profile and your social social accounts URL so name bio if you want pronouns URL social accounts choose your public email if you even want to show one uh so there's that there if you're looking for a job you can also say hey I'm looking for work um you can pin specific GitHub repos that best showcase your work so you know if you want to say I made this video came called Swap and pop a long time ago this is like 2016 which was a clone of testers attack so I wanted to Showcase that really good skills or maybe the 100 days of cloud that was another project that I had so there's other things like that that you might want to showcase um and it's very easy to pin you just go there and say I want to pin these repos or these gists if you don't know what gists are we'll talk about it in the gist section for uh contribut activity this is going to show how active uh your Prof uh public profile is and so here we are seeing activity I think these are all basically for public rep some people get really creative and they try to um make their activity uh look like a photo I'm trying to find my there's my mouse so they might try to make this look like something and and into artwork by purposely committing they might have like a bot that does that I don't do that but uh that is something that you can do but there you go okay hey it's Angie Brown and we're taking a look at GitHub user profile so we do have uh this new user I created but I want to show you what mine looks like first because I want to just make a call out uh to something that might show up on the exam and I didn't include in the lecture slides and it honestly threw me off that they even bothered asking this in the exam but uh they might ask you about uh some of the features uh in the profile and one of them is about achievements so I don't know why why they would ever ask this but achievements are things that you do um that you can earn uh uh these pointless badges for doing certain things okay what those things are I don't even know I don't even think it matters but the point is that they have them here and they'll ask you on the exam about achievements for some crazy reason so I wanted to point that out but you have an idea of what my repo looks like or my profile looks like let's go back over to the other account and get set up so we already set up a um a user profile photo for this one and before it was it was showing the old one so we couldn't really see it also I just notice that we can set status here I didn't even know that I don't think I would ever do that this isn't a you know it's not it's this is not a um uh what do you call it a social media platform but whatever they have everything under the sun here but this is now showing up here you've unlocked new achievements with private contributions show them off by including private contributions in your profile in your settings and look hey I'm already getting junk achievements but just understand that they're there um what we can do is pin this here so we can go ahead and say let's pin uh this repository here um apparently we can pin this other one I think it's CU we contributed to it that's why we can pin it I'm going to go ahead and just say GitHub examples and save my own and it was already kind of showing up there but now it's there we can go over to gists for fun and make a new gist and then pin that just say uh hello hello. MD and I'm just going to go here and say puts hello H world and we'll scroll on down and we will create this as a public gist okay I'm going to go back over here I might already show up because we have such few stuff here but I can open this up and I'll pin this and now I have this gist so maybe if you want to like have a read me file and have more information this is actually kind of a smart idea would be to have like two of them up here and pin them I never even thought of that uh let's go uh ahead and get in our uh read me page so we know that if we create a repo with the exact same name we can have that so I'll go ahead and make a new repo I call this one Andrew WC Brown and notice that we get this nice little popup I like the little icon or the uh pixel graphic here this is a special repo okay make sure it's initialized with the read me to get started so go ahead and create a read me and that's now there if we go over to our profile okay it's there so pretty straightforward not much else to say there um there you go okay we'll see you in the next one ciao let's quickly talk about readme files these are markdown files that provide documentation and structional information and a repo a GitHub repo that has a readme.md or readme and all caps or read me and all caps with. MD in the projects rout will be rendered on the homepage there's actually some other markdown files that will also be rendered there but it's really important to remember the read me one as it will probably come up as an exam question and they'll actually ask you like what uh where where should this be located it's always in the root that's what's going to render I don't think it renders anything else but that one and they might kind of trick you there um you do get this nice little table of contents on the right hand side so if you have uh headings it will figure that out for you there I remember that wasn't there before so that's really nice um but yeah it's as simple as that okay so GitHub wants you to know about basic repo navigation what that means I don't really know so I'm taking my best guess to show you what that is uh So within a GitHub repo you will have a navigation bar with various features of your GitHub repo and this is how you get to all the cool stuff and the main one is code this is where your code's going to live um such as files folders things like that um we have issues that's for tracking problems it's basically a ticket tracker we have pull requests that's where we're going to be uh uh when we're managing collaboration with other developers and they want to bring changes into our repo it's our opportunity to check that work before it gets merged in we have actions that's for GitHub actions uh for projects that's for GitHub projects uh for wikis that's the wiki security is like a a list or a um a checklist of things that you should do I think it changes if you are looking at the context of a uh as a a user and you're not the owner of the repo you're going to see maybe the security policy or different information but if you are the owner you're going to have a checklist of things you should do and it basically mirrors kind of what's in the settings page under security so it's kind of weird that they do that but that's how they do it then we have insights this provides uh statistics mostly in the form of charts and graphs about the repo sometimes this information is public sometimes it's private then you have settings this is where you control all the settings for your repo um the other thing is that when you are using at least in the code section you can navigate around files so I showed showed you this in a a prior um follow along but the idea is you can search stuff you can see the contents of file you can comment on code per line so there you go so when you create a repo you can choose which owner you want it to be so right now I have it set as uh my personal account but you could drop that down and you could also choose an organization that you belong to repo names are scoped B based on the account so you can have the same name uh for different organizations other people can have the same name if they're a different user so just understand that you can do that uh you need to choose an available GitHub name again based on that scope uh your repos can either be public or private um pretty selfexplanatory you can quickly add a readme file a do get ignore and license it's very very important to remember those three because you might get an exam question asking about the three things that you can quickly and easily add if you're using the CLI you can add it uh this way or create one we did this earlier when we did the GitHub CLI kind of demonstration and we found out that repos require special additional permissions or personal access token permissions um that the GitHub Cod spaces would not allow you to do but yeah there you go that's a creat a repo all right let's go ahead and create ourselves a repo I know we already know how to do this but it gives us an opportunity to talk a little bit more about uh some of the things that might appear on the exam you can create one up here in the top right corner and I have this double click problem so it's getting a bit confused I can go to this new green button that's usually what I do and we can have a new repo so I'm going to say my uh cool repo right we can provide a description um this repo is amazing and we can set it as public or private I'm going to stick with private for now and we'll add a read me we'll drop down to get ignore we'll say may we're working with Ruby so we'll get that by default and we'll add a license like MIT we go ahead and create that repo um I want to point out that you have other things that are rendered here so that should be very clear um we have releases and packages which we should talk about at some point I'm going to leave this repo around if we want to play around with it um but uh yeah it's pretty clear how to create a repo it's not hard let's go take a look at a more popular repo like Ruby on Rails um so I'm just going to type this up here and type in rails and we'll take a look and see what they have um so if we go into here you'll notice there are just more things we have codes of conduct right we have our MIT we have our security policy if we go up here to the security tab this is what we can see um so we have the security policy being rendered out here and then it's showing um possible uh exposures probably based on one of the scanners I'm not exactly sure which one is showing that um but that is that there if we go back to our own repo we might be able to take a look at security here hold on uh going back to wherever that one was we just made that repo it can be a little bit of pain to sometimes find your own repos I'm not sure why they've never made that easier but just how it is and if we go down we can find my cool repo here and there's this security Tab and notice that it's listing out uh things that you should do for your repo it's important to know what these are because um well if you have this uh the exam is going to probably ask you like what's what things can you access from here and this is just from the public repo if you have a private repo it's going to be different sorry this is private public can be different so let's just open this up and make a comparison and see if what kind of difference there is here so if we go over to repo here and we go into this public one over here what options do we get so we get a lot more going on here so notice that this is the price private and that is the public probably because if you're if you had a paid version You' then get additional code scanning and secret scanning for public repos you automatically get that stuff I just want to point out that all this stuff is also under your settings under uh Security Options so they kind of just like repeat it there you know so it's just what they do but hopefully that makes sense and that's all I wanted to show you so I'll see you in the next one ciao let's talk about maintaining a repo now what's unusual about this slide content It's Not Unusual but it's the fact that in the outline they have a whole section for GitHub Administration and uh for whatever reason I have it over here as opposed into the other section because of the way the outline is designed so understand that I'm not going to cover that stuff in that other section because it's just repeated um but anyway let's continue on and look at maintaining repo so the first thing is your name so you can change the name of the repo if you do not like it as long as the name is available you can absolutely do that and a reminder that repo names are scoped based on personal or organizational accounts or organization accounts I I keep writing organizational but it means the same thing uh you can change the base Branch the default Branch uh you can rename it um just so you know Maine is the unspoken best practice for naming your base Branch everybody does it the old one was Master nobody calls it Master anymore um you can opt in and opt out of some features for your GitHub repo I say some as a catch all just in case there's features that do not show up or there's ones that are locked in um but that's pretty straightforward you just check a box and you might have to do some additional configuration then there's the danger zone which contains actions you need to think twice about because they cannot be undone if you make a big mistake and in the danger zone we have the ability to change the repo visibility um it's important to understand what happens when you make a a a repo from private to public the code will be visible to everyone who can visit at github.com anyone can Fork your repo all push rule sets will be disabled your changes will be published as activity now will this show up in the exam probably not I didn't see it but that is something to consider um you can disable Branch protection rules uh so Branch protection rules are strict workflow rules uh uh that just like will do something like disallow someone from pushing to Main and uh you can temporarily disable them if you have to apply quick fixes and you can't work around those r rules easily you can transfer ownership to somebody else and they'll become the owner of the repo you can archive the repo so it becomes read only you can delete the repo so there you go all right time for some repo maintenance uh so what we're going to do is I want to create a new repo I'm going to make it in my other account uh just because we're going to want to transfer from one to another but I'm going to go here and just say um uh under here Omen King and I'm gon say my cool repo 2 okay and I'm gonna just make this private and I'm going to add a read me here um I'm going to go ahead and create this repo okay so now that this is repo created we can go over to our settings and let's say I didn't like the name two I need it to be three because we already have another one called two in the other account I'm going to rename that and it renames before we used to rename it used to take time now it's instantaneous which is really really great if we scroll on down we could change the main branch we could change the name to main two um there are some uh limitations there because it's not showing all of our options as we don't have other branches apparently it doesn't create it instantaneously but it will change it in a bit of time there it is so I think it has taken effect if we go here and yeah it shows that it's been renamed so that sounds really good we're going to go back over to settings notice that we can checkbox and uh checkbox on and off features let's let's get rid of issues let's get rid of projects if we go over here to our code notice that they have vanished across the top so that is great we'll scroll on down um we have more abilities somewhere here in the danger zone so we can change our visibility it will give us a warning about it I'm not sure why it's making it so hard I'm going to make this public I'm going to say that I I accept the changes and we're going to make it public and then apparently I have to confirm so I'm going to get out my phone and it wants me to enter a number into my phone okay so 37 approve great and I'll wait a moment for it to take effect there we go so now it is public um we can disable our Branch rules so I'm going to go ahead and do that uh we can go ahead and transfer this repo I'm going to send it to um a specific person so this is going to be I want to send it to Andrew WC Brown which is the other me and then I got to type in the repo name so we'll go ahead and do that my cool repo 3 I understand okay so now it should be transferred um and I think the other person has to accept so I don't think it's instantaneous so if we go over here h do I have the repo now if I go up here in my notifications how do I see the repo transfer I'm not sure I'm going to go check the email for this account and see if it shows up there okay all right so in my email we can see over here that uh there is a repo transfer link so I'm going to go ahead and click that GitHub repo templates is a feature for public repos that allows other GitHub users to make a copy of the contents of the template repo to use as a starting point for their own repo and I believe it's only for public I I haven't checked for private but I don't know why you'd want to use it for private we set a uh a repo as as a template by checking box on the template repository and then you'll have this option to use the template and when you click use this template it will then ask you to choose a new name and it'll say what do you want to include and then it'll show that that was generated from that other template I use these in my boot camps because I will create a starter project and then you will start from that template how are these how is this different from cloning or forking um the idea here is that um you're starting with a clean repo you're not having all the baggage of of stuff that comes with it it is a really clear clean repo and so that's how you're going to go ahead and uh utilize it but that use case that I explained for which is like you know you want to have something like a project that people are going to start as a basis of that's where going to be using repo templates okay ciao hey it's Angie Brown and this fall along we'll go ahead and make a repo template so um we have here um let's go over here to our other repo trying to find it sometimes it's a bit hard to navigate repos there we go that's a bit better and so we have this my cool repo what I want to do is convert this repo into a public repo for now just so that we can utilize this feature I want to go to the top and see if we can make a template actually it looks like we can I'm really surprised because what would be the point if um it's private you know what I mean because we go here how's anyone going to click that button it doesn't make any sense so I really think that that is a public feature and notice I actually checkbox it on and it turned off so I think it is yeah it is nope okay it's on now all right I mean I guess you could use it to make your own from it so I guess my thought was it was always about other people using it but I guess you could make your own default template and use it for yourself so I guess it's not just a public feature but they're never going to ask you on the exam so I'm not going to fix the slides because of that let's go ahead and uh create a new repository from this template and we'll just say my cool repo 2 and we'll make it private and also we can include other branches but I don't want anything else and there we go so now we have this uh repo that is making a copy of we'll give it a moment and here it is you can see it's generated from that one and there you go ciao so in GitHub you can clone a repo programmatically three different ways uh we have the first which is https uh you will have to supply a GitHub username and password on the clone and you'll need to set uh get to cach the credentials if you don't want to keep entering them in I didn't write it in here but when it says password we're talking about the um personal access token because GitHub does not let you use passwords anymore um but in the documentation it kind of suggests that you can use a password because it says password protected oh not here but under here would it would it would say that um for SSH uh you can utilize that method you'll have to have an SSH key pair and you'll have to upload that to your uh GitHub account then we have the GitHub CLI um so we can do that as well this is going to use credentials uh when you do GitHub login it'll actually use either a personal access token or SSH we can also clone repos in the GitHub desktop and we can just download a zip it's not really cloning but we can download the contents of it um so that's pretty straightforward there sometimes you just want the the the codes repo um I want to point out that we did all this in the quick and dirty git and GitHub crash course so if you're wondering how to do these three make sure you have watched that video and you've done it all okay see you in the next one ciao you can add files to your GitHub repo directly via the GitHub UI if you drop down code you or sorry add file you'll have create new file or upload files so it's great for both text and binary files um and uh the idea here is that when you uh go ahead and add a file if you need to have folders you can put a for Slash and it will end up creating as many folders as you want and then you put the name in and you just create that file there when adding multiple files that you also need to edit you can also quickly use there are lots of ways of creating branches in GitHub and git um something that you should really know how to do is to use this single line command get checkout hyphen B to both create and check out a branch in one go you should absolutely know how to do get push hyphen U origin staging which is basically The Hyphen U is short for hyphen hyphen setup stream I know it looks like a single hyphen there but there's actually two uh for this flag you can create branches from issues um and then the branch and issue will be Associated and linked you can directly create branches in the GitHub UI you can create branches in the GitHub desktop and I'm sure you can create branches in the GitHub CLI and uh yeah there you go hey it's Angie Brown and this fall along I want to create some branches nothing super difficult to do but um something that will take us just a moment I'm going to go ahead and use um our my cool repo and what I want to do here is I want to go ahead actually I want to clean these up I don't want to have a bunch of uh junk repos hanging around so actually I decided against that and I just want to keep things clean and keep with our single repo even if it is U public so I'm going to go ahead and type my cool repo here and clean this up Andrew WC Brown or man geez Andrew WC brown brown my cool repo it's that autocomplete that's messing it up there we go and I'm just going to go ahead and also get rid of this one and then we'll just be really focused on what we need to do at hand here just give me a moment there we go okay so now let's just go back to our GitHub examples and there are a few ways that we can create issues uh one is or sorry branches one way is to go to the branches Tab and I'm pretty sure we can just create them right here so I can go here and just say uh feature uh cool one okay and we can say what we're branching from so that's an example and there it is uh another really useful way and something I really recommend is you create an issue and we'll and we'll make a task saying create a branch from an issue okay and then what we can do is then go ahead and create a branch here in development in the bottom right corner noce is going to put the number in here that's a very common pattern is to have whatever your issued number is and then a a a short name for the branch okay then saying like what should we do next code spaces locally I don't really want to do anything next I just want to um do nothing but I'll go ahead and hit create branch and so then it gives us like a button where we could click to go ahead and play around with it so that is something I do a lot when I teach boot camps I show this a lot this is a very common workflow and something you should absolutely remember uh that you can do um let's go ahead and launch up this in code spaces going to go here and uh we have this one here sure I'll launch up this old one sure why not and once this is launched up we'll take a look and learn how to use a very cool shorthand for um implementing uh checkout and creating a branch in one go okay so just back here when this is ready all right all right so this is back up and running and notice that we are currently in the main branch we can type in get Branch to get a list of br branches and so what I want to do is I want to create myself a new Branch here and actually there are other branches it's just not showing them if we do get pull um it might show us those other branches there we go and now if we type in get Branch it still doesn't show them but that doesn't mean we can't check them out but uh our um our uh uh program is aware of it we might also be able to create branches within a git graph these were things that we installed earlier so they might have the option to do that here I'm not 100% sure see create Branch so we could do that as well I'm not going to do that but what I really want to show you is something that will show up in the exam I'm actually really surprised that it did but it is a really good thing to to um uh to know is that normally when you create a branch you'd have to type in get branch and I'd say my new Branch like this and then I'd have to do get check out my new Branch okay and so that's something you can do but what is more efficient you go check out back to main is we can do that in one call we can see get checkout hyphen B for branch my new Branch 2 and that's going to create that branch and check it out so really make sure you remember this one because it will absolutely show up on your exam it's absolutely something you'll use every single day I strongly recommend it the last thing um I want to go over is just pushing to origin so what we can do is is set um Upstream but think that U is a lot easier to do we say origin and we just say my new Branch here two and then that will push that Branch up there because you really want to know how to set that origin so that's all I really wanted to show you and um yeah we can just stop this environment so we'll go ahead to command pallet just say stop current code space and I'll see you in the next one okay CIA so starring repos is uh something that we can do and it's similar to bookmarking uh for a repo that we're interested in keeping track of and so stars are public and everyone can see them and usually this is an indicator whether something is really popular in fact GitHub might take notice uh in their community and do something nice um so a lot of people seem to care about star counts and uh make it their goal to try to get as many as they can if you want to find um starred projects that you have starred you can go to github.com stars and there's a few other things that we can explore um and you know in the exam they might actually ask you what that URL is to get to uh your starred um uh uh starred things that you have starred so just make sure you remember that URL okay hey this is Angie Brown and this follow along I want to take a look at starring Repose so what we can do here is just go into our own project and I think we could star our own which is a little bit silly but it's something we can do we could also put it into a list so let's go ahead and hit start and I might also want to say this is for inspiration and so now that I've started that stuff let's go take a look at our actual start pages so we could type in Stars at the top here but I think also on the right hand side we can go to your stars and um I mean this is showing stuff that we've starred and this has a list but that wasn't the same page that I saw so I'm actually surprised this is different and maybe there's actually two there's this one and another one so let's go ahead and type in Stars at the top here yeah why do they have why do they have two different pages they got this one and then they got this one and to me it's like the same thing okay whatever I guess maybe one is specific to the repo so this one's for Andre Brown Stars so is that like public ones that everyone else can see what if I go up to here to my profile you know what I actually never noticed these tabs up here before so yeah I guess this is your public profile one of things that you have started if you want to show other people I didn't realize that and then we actually have this other one which is the Stars okay um I could probably show you something a little bit more because in mine I have a lot more starred stuff not that I remember what I have starred but if we go here to Stars you can see a lot more uh stuff here and it shows you could jump to a friend we have categories which is kind of cool I don't really see the list here but I suppose that's more for the profile uh but yeah that's about it um and maybe you might want to remember uh over here you all for this okay because like I remember just on the exam they're asking about like the star the star URL and I know that's supposed to be Stars okay but we'll see you in the next one ciao another thing we can do is watch repos and this allows you to stay stay informed about activities occurring within a repo so the idea is that you'll hit watch and then you can say uh to what level of notifications you want for watching and notice that if I go custom I can say exactly what I'm looking to watch and in then your GitHub account you can specify how you want to be notified so there you go let's take a look at watching repos and I actually can point out a repo that drives me crazy because um somehow I got I got subscribed to it and they update it so often and it's Wing Lang and I'm not saying it's a bad project I'm just saying like they really shouldn't have opted everybody into the uh to the alerts because it it's driven me crazy um so like notice here I said stop ignoring because I I was like tired of getting updates for this and the reason why was that in order to get access to this project in the beta they had to add you uh in some in some manner I'm not sure if it was a contributor or something else but all I know I was really getting sick and tired of getting alerts on my phone so cuz it'll it'll have in summaries and it'll it'll fill up these digest emails and it gets annoying so I ignored it okay but let's go ahead and I'm going to pretend that I want to uh watch another project here from Andrew Brown and we can go over here to GitHub examples and then we can go ahead and click watch and um we can say all activity right we go to custom change maybe we just want issues okay I'll go back and say for everything here there we go and I just want to point out if you go to your settings uh your settings over here and then we go to Notifications we can control you know what we want to see for notification specifically for watching we can say here on GitHub or email you say I don't want the emails okay so very straightforward um is there a place to see all of the stuff that you're watching probably uh we could try like I think it's under notifications it's like notifications maybe it's like watching I know this is another slide later on in the course here it is and so I can see everything that I'm watching and I could just say stop watching all the stuff notice that I'm automatically watching stuff for my own repo so automatically you're always set to watch all of them if that makes sense but there you go feature previews allows you to enable or disable features that are in beta in your personal accounts so the idea is that we have feature uh feat previews and we go over here and then just kind of enable it is what we want to have um some of them might be already turned on some of them you might want to turn off but let's go take a look at it okay all right so I'm in my count and I want to go ahead and take a look at fe uh feature previews I don't want to meddle with my main account but I'm going to go here and go to feature previews and here we can see some stuff so let's say we wanted the command pallet that sounds really cool I'm going to turn that on actually I think it's already on I didn't even know that we could do that and it seems like we would have like this Global search thing we could turn off slash commands if we wanted to so we say disable or enable it let's go take a look at command pallets because I even know that we had it says here contrl K I'm on a Windows machine right now so we have control all K or control K I'm going to give that a go and so I'm going to try this contrl K oo look at that that is smooth and so then we can jump to something uh what if I type in gists no but I mean like maybe we could find stuff really quickly I mean that's kind of nice like P personal access token uh let's say I want to go to Andrew or let's say we want to go to uh examples oh yeah I'm going to use that a lot more you might see me doing that I might tell you that um I really hope that that becomes a main feature because it's really nice um feature previews I assume this is beta um I don't think Alpha features ever get shown but that is really cool I'm surprised they didn't put that in the exam anyway we'll see the next one okay ciao so tagging is used to capture a point in history to Mark version released of your codebase and GitHub makes it easy to explore tag versions of your git Rebo so here's an example of Ruby on Rails and you can see they have 516 tags and if you go into the drop down where your branches are you can switch over to the tags and you can see the versioning um tagging is not specific to GitHub it is a feature of G um and just a good practice to know these are common uh git commands get tag commands you absolutely should know they're super useful uh to utilize and a very common um workflow is if you have a production Branch to tag when you tag a release that would be the thing that would trigger it out and send it uh to uh your production compute so um yeah tagging is super important um and often when you see milestones in GitHub they'll usually correspond to tags and we looked at milestones we saw that they were verging them based on or the names of them were based on tag releases that they're they're working towards um so yeah I just want to get you some practical knowledge with tags even if it doesn't show up on the exam okay hey this is Andrew Brown and this fall along I want to show you tagging and if you're hearing my uh heater in the background it is super cold in my office it's like 10 cels I do not have heat and I'm doing the best I can so sorry for the background noise or the shuffling of the snowsuit but let's go ahead and learn a bit about tagging because tagging is such a useful skill um that there's no way I was not going to show you this so what we'll do is we'll go over to um let's say our GitHub our GitHub examples repo going to go over here and um yeah we'll go into this one here and what I want to do here is I want to start making some tags and what we'll need to do is launch up a new code space okay we'll give it a moment to load up and I'll be back in just a minute you know what I think what I ended up doing was running the exam Pro GitHub example so I'm just going to go back because this one's never going to work for me and I'm going to make sure that I'm in the correct directory so it's this one that I want and we'll go back up here I'm going to go ahead and uh well if I already have an active one I would probably rather use that so I'm just going to open this one you just got to get your code space up however you're going to get it up um but I just want to get in here and get working so I'm going to launch this one no that was the one that was building I think yeah I'm not sure sure exactly what's wrong container build failed checking troubleshooting view logs uh I didn't know you check the logs as it's building Docker build X build failed it's it's uh failing with terraform so um I thought we uh I thought we fixed that so if we go into this is this still having the terraform code in here it is so what I'm just going to do here just to um you know what I think it is um because sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and what happened last time is it ran out of space uh is what I noticed it was really a weird thing that happened so what I'm going to do is just stop this code workspace go up here stop stop stop let me stop it please you ran out of space that's fine I get it let me stop the workspace okay and what I'm going to do since this seems to get us more reliable results is always deleting the code space I'm going to go ahead and delete this here and I'm just going to go ahead and make a new one okay so go all the way back here to the Andre Brown one here and we'll make a new one and unfortunately that's the most reliable way to use codes space again I really prefer giod I don't have these issues with giod ever but we'll let this spin up and I'll be back here in just a moment okay and this environment is still failing to build it's really bizarre what's going on here um and I'm not exactly sure why it's failing but uh okay what I'm going to do I'm going to go back to view logs here because maybe it's messing up on that terraform again it is Terron it's like download a bunch of stuff I don't need so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go in here and I'm just going to ignore this I'm sure it's going to continue spinning up I'm going to click into my Dev container and I'm going to edit this and for whatever reason it's just not working so I'm going to comment this out for now and we're going to just pretend terraform doesn't exist was working fine so many times but if that fixes it that's good enough for me okay so I'm going to go to our uh code spaces again go ahead and delete this one and I'm going to go back to that repo if I can please make sure I'm on the right one and we'll go ahead and launch it and then maybe that must be old Let me refresh that I thought we stopped it there we go we'll start a new one and then maybe this time we'll get into code spaces so see you back in a second okay all right so this environment finally worked I guess terraform was giving us trouble and you know I thought these these these packages were prebuilt um but I guess there must be compiling at the time of source code and there's some issue that's happening so it might not have that we ran out of space it just might have not worked and totally a detour to what we wanted to be doing but what I'm going to do is go ahead and create a new folder here and this one's going to be called Tags as we want to just work through some tagging stuff readme.md okay and uh there's a few things I want to show you how to do the first thing is how to tag so like we could say version 1.0.0 we could push our tags we will check out we could check out a tag at some point I mean that's pretty straightforward I don't think I need to show you that but I'm just going to write it out here so you can see it 1.0.0 we can do get tag hyphen d one Z Z to delete our tag and then we can uh delete our remote tag those are the three things I want you to know so before we do this I want to talk about semantic versioning because semantic versioning is a way of tagging okay and most repos use this if you see a v in front of it I know I used v as an example there uh in in the actual slides I I put a v in front of it but uh generally this is the format that a lot of Open Source projects and places like to use um depending on how old the project is they might have just stuck with the v in front of it and use everything else with that we can take a look here and see what rails does as an example repo rails and what I want to do here is just take a look at how they're tagging so see they have a v in front of it and but they've been around forever and um I'm just telling you like at one point this page did not exist there there was this idea of semantic versioning but whenever it came out you know some of these projects existed before then so that's the reason why you might not see it um but anyway we'll come back all the way over here and I like to stick with semantic versioning as best I can as long as I remember how to do it and so the idea is uh we want to apply tag to a particular commit and just to make things a little bit easier let's get into a dark theme and the other thing I I'm going to want to have installed here is get graph all right and I think that if we have this installed oh looks like it's already installed did it actually remember my settings remember I complain about how often it does not remember my settings it might actually worked in this case so if I go down below here I have git graph and grit log they're actually both installed but why the theme didn't persist I don't know and the idea here is that I want to be able to apply a tag um and the way we can do that is we're going to go ahead we have some uncommitted changes going just say tagging whoops we'll just say uh tagging here and we'll go ahead and first try to apply a tag so we'll say get tag 1.0.0 and it should show up here there it is okay great but understand this tag is local if we go over to our repo and we give this a nice refresh it's not here zero tags okay so if we want that tag to go up have to go get push hyphen hyen tags okay when you do your regular push you can add that as well you can see that it's been pushed we'll go back over to here here we'll give this a nice refresh and now we have one tag we go over here one tag so good shape right um and the idea is you can switch over to it just like a branch you can check it out just like a branch um and so that's something that is really useful if we go back over to get G graph we can now see uh it actually doesn't show you if it's pushed which is U one thing I think is a bit sad but uh it doesn't show you when it's pushed so that is one indicator that can be a little bit confusing here um and actually when we did push push tags it didn't actually push the uh the commit so I always thought it did both but I guess it only does the tag when you do that so we'll type in get push and make sure that that's pushed as well there we go they're all over here now let's say we made a mistake with their tag sometimes you do this you might uh someone else tag something and then you tagged it the same and you got to delete your tag so we have to delete it in two places we have to delete it locally get tag hyen d10 okay okay but if you go here it still exists so I'm going to give this a nice hard refresh and this absolutely exists so if we want to get rid of this one we're going to have to type get tag hyphen hyphen delete origin one0 Z okay um and it didn't work there I mean that's the oh you know it's push it's push sorry it's push we'll say get push delete origin 1.0.0 point0 and so now it's deleted it we probably should have took a look at the um uh the GitHub config file that there might have been something interesting there but uh we didn't I'm going go ahead and give this a nice refresh here and I'm just curious what would this is rails it's not us but if we go back here and give this a refresh this should now be gone I'm just going to tag this one more time okay so I'm going to go ahead here and say get tag 1.0 .0 I'm going to say get push hyphen hyen tags if you wanted to tag some other place you have to check out that commit using the shot code and then tag it I'm not going to do that here let's go take a look at the um the git directory because in that git directory it might show us something interesting in the config file so we go to settings and we know that we have to tell to unhide certain stuff okay so I'm looking for hidden files in here it's somewhere in here put type in dogit could find that dogit here it is it's under exclusions so I want to just take that out so I can see it and we'll go ahead and open up our config directory because what I want to see is if there was any tagging information in here and there's not so so there's nothing new here to see I just thought there might be but yeah that's all there is to tagging and uh we'll call this one done and I'll see you in the next one um okay so ciao so GitHub releases allows you to create releases with release notes and linked assets such as zip sources or binaries for specific platforms so in a get repo you'll see releases and from there you can read about the release and see all the stuff that has changed and there might be the source code or binaries if you if this is something like um I'm trying to think of an example like let's say you like to play video games and there's an emulator uh for like the PlayStation uh they'll have like builds here for Windows Mac and um other things here uh maybe you make a video game in general you could distribute the binary here it's anything where you're Distributing the binaries or the SCE source code but you're making very clear what has changed as a release um and often like when I'm having issu issues with something I will actually go through and read the releases when let's say um like react router have you ever used react router Dom and they've changed versions I'm trying to understand like what compatibilities have changed what does not work anymore maybe I was experiencing a bug and if they do a good job with the documentation it will be in there so there you go hey everyone in this fall along I want to take a look at GitHub releases as it is a very useful feature to let people know about changes that are happening in your repo um so before we do let's go take a look at some other project that might have changes I'm trying to think of something interesting like maybe an emulator um so I'm just typing emulator in here I'm just looking for one here's a Nintendo switch emulator or maybe PS PS2 I'd rather do PS2 I feel like they might have good uh information about changes like PCS pcsx2 and on the right hand side you can see we have releases and if we open up the releases um they do not tell you much okay so that's not a great example so we'll go back to another one and we'll try another uh video game emulator maybe we can just try putting the word emulator you know and people can write whatever kind of releases they want this doesn't have releases uh we'll try the 3DS emulator this one doesn't have releases we have um this one here do they have releases no well they do they do no just tags okay so I guess we're just going to not get really good ones here but I guess we could just go to rails because they seem to always have enough for us but I just wanted something that was written a little bit more uh nicer so you could see a good example of a release but here is one where um you know they're talking about different versions I feel like if there was a release for a specific uh tag version right that uh we get better information like when rails first came out like 70 probably would be a good one so I'm just scrolling through here I mean these are pretty good but again I just want to try to find a major release one is this this 1.0 seven I'm going to just type in 7.0.0 might have to scroll a bit to get it to load 08 there must be where is it what it just skips over it okay well I mean 71 was pretty good so we'll go over back to 71 and uh yeah like here it's telling you about all the libraries and things that are Chang this one's a bit better because it's showing examples of things that have changed so you can p whatever you want to release and it's just to help communicate what the differences are because a lot of times you just don't know so we did do some tagging and that's a great opportunity for us to create our own release in our own repo so what I'm going to do is go back over to our home I'm going to find find this repo that we have I'm going to go over to releases and we're going to create ourselves our own release and we'll just say version uh 1.0.0 ready for the world the best GitHub example materials around my hands are cold if if you can't tell I'm uh sorry but I'm in like full snowsuit right now and I got the heater blowing so if you hear the heater I apologize but it's just how it is right now in my office anyway we you can choose a tag which is great and then um you can then attach the binary so the idea is we would download the zip and then reupload it again I'm not going to do that because that's pretty straightforward we'll go ahead and do that and so there's our release and that's all I really wanted to show you for releases apparently there's a compare button I didn't even know that so that might be kind of cool to do but um yeah there you go so GitHub packages is a platform for hosting and managing packages including containers and other dependencies and the things that it can uh host in terms of its package registry or repository is Javascript packages ruby gems Java Maven and Gradle packages net packages and Docker images and the last one I think is going to be the most common uh one that people can utilize um they have a free tier they have a pay tier so you can start using this right away and we will go give it a go um probably the easiest thing we could do would be to create a Docker uh container and then push it to GitHub packages so that's kind of the code that we'll have to go through we can make a simple hello world Docker file run it make sure we build it and uh GitHub actions could be used to build and then publish I put I wrote the word public but publish packages to GitHub pages so there you go hey this is Angie Brown and this fall along what I want to do is is go ahead and create a GitHub package so what you're going to need to do is start up a code space I actually already have mine running I think by this point you probably know how to do that I just uh was working on the video earlier and I had to close out and restart so that's where we are now so anyway I'm going to make a new folder in here this will be for uh pack GitHub GitHub packages okay and you're going to try to spell s if you hear a bit of noise in the background it's cuz I'm running the little space heater near my feet so my feet don't freeze I'm in full snowsuit right now okay but anyway what we'll do is we'll go into the package of directory and we'll make a new file and we'll call it Docker file okay and from here um we want to create this little Docker image so we'll say Alpine uh latest this isn't a Docker course I'm not teaching all this but just follow along with me here or just copy paste it from my repo whichever you want to do Echo we'll say hello world okay so I'm going to go ahead and save that file and now what I want to do is go into that directory and build it so what I'll do is run Docker build hyphen T hello world period we'll build that okay and and now we'll try to run it make sure it works there we go that works okay and so we're in good shape uh the other part here I would say is now that we have our Docker image built we want to now push that so um I'm going to make a new read me file so I just have a little bit of room to work with here and there's a few things we need to do we need to set our username so I'm going to say username here I'm just going to set mine as what I am Andrew Brown WC Brown that's the count that I have here okay and I'm going to put export in front of it so I can export it and yeah I want allow pasting good and we'll hit enter it actually double pasted it so I got to be careful there I imagine this is a bit hard to read so I'm just going to bump up the font a bit and so that should be set the next thing is I'll need a personal access token so I'm going to go over here and we've done personal access tokens quite a bit in this course and we'll go down to developer settings and we'll make a new one and this one is going to well I guess we got to confirm with GitHub mobile first get my phone out here and uh it wants me to enter a code in one two okay this one's going to be for GitHub packages oh I'm not registering an app whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa let's go back personal access tokens there we go there's an old one I'm going to delete that and I'm going to generate out a new one we'll say uh GitHub packages I want this only to be for a day just in case I forget it and someone tries to take it and this is going to be for a specific repo so we'll go down here and say this repo and then for permissions I'm looking for packages packages it's under here maybe packages let's search for it packages it says we need a personal access token um so I'm not seeing packages in here and this makes me think that we should probably use a traditional one I don't normally do this but because I cannot find it I'm going use a classic token so that's what I'm going to do um I'm going to go here I'm going to generate a new token really wants to make make a new one and just say GitHub packages and so it's really similar um very similar to the other one well I wanted expire and I'm looking for packages here it is read and write packages delete packages so I'm not sure where that new one is in the new one maybe it's not and we just have to use the classic token we'll go ahead and generate that token out I now have this token I'm going to bring it on over to uh uh here and I want to set this as our environment variables I'm going to say GH token and we're going to paste that in okay we'll we'll copy this good I'll paste it in and hit enter so now that's set um I need to set the image name I'm just going to keep putting the GH under it image name just so it's a bit easier for me to find them when I want to find all the environment variables later hello world we'll go ahead and do that and copy that and paste it in hit enter uh I'm going to put export in front of that just in case that didn't work and then I'm going to do export my hands are really cold it's really cold in here uh I think it's like7 it's because my shed uh has a um oil furnace or gas yeah oil furnace and I have to go drive out to um The the Reserve to get some gas and it's just really bad weather so I'm just trying to get this done so you folks can get this course as quickly as possible so we've exported those values so that's really good I want to make sure that they're set so I'm going to type in EnV GP GH and there they are okay so now we need to write some code the first thing is we need to log into Docker and so Docker somehow talks to GitHub I'm not sure how that works but we'll just go ahead and work with it here so I'm going to say Docker login U we're going to say g c say GHC so that's for GitHub container repository I'm assuming hyphen U and then we'll say GH username and then we'll say password STD in okay so that'll pass the password that's what that pipe does and see if that works we'll hit enter uh doesn't know what that flag is did I type it wrong I did and we'll copy that and we'll paste that there enter and so now we're logged in so that's step number one step number two is we need to tag our Docker container so we'll say uh Docker tag and I want my image name and then my version uh this will be GH version and this will be GH I mean we could just write it out if it's a bit simpler for everybody so we just say hello world one0 and then on the other side be GHC doio and then that would be our username so I could just type it in here it's up to you whether you want to use environment variables or not I'm just uh I just want it to work so I'm just going to write it out in full even though we made environment variables up here for this particular use case but that's okay one z z so the idea is we're going to tag um our Docker image we built is uh for 1.0 to map to here okay we'll go ahead and copy that hit enter um no such image I mean there is no tag called 1.0.0 on it we do Docker list or Docker images it's called latest so we'll change this to be latest we can make the other tag latest as well but I I'm going to make it 1.0.0 I'm not sure why I'm just going to do that so how it's going to be we'll go ahead and enter and so now that's tagged and so now we should be able to push it GHC doio slash say Andrew WC Brown for slash hello world colon 1.0.0 copy enter um so it says an image with the tag does not locally exists with that tag so maybe I tagged it wrong THC R iio I spelled it wrong yeah and we could have just copied this one here to get it all right it enter and there it's pushing it okay so pretty straightforward uh we could have even done this we could said like uh export um tag name right and we could have done this right and then we could just done that and we could have done that I'm just cleaning it up doing that uh post post refactor here and um here we could have just put these in as such so we could have done this and then this would have been GH uh image name and then this would have been GH version and so you get the idea there so that's pretty much it let's go take a look and see where this actually is I'm done with this personal access token so I want to delete it so nobody else is using it and um this revokes all personal access to in class classic just in case I'm going to do this so I'm going to say Andrew WC Brown I think they're all revoked but just in case they not let's do that anyway and we'll go over here and we'll take a look at our profile because it might show up under packages here I'm not exactly sure how you set public packages oh there it is it's private all right and I'm not sure if it's specific to a repo link this package to a repository so I guess if we wanted to link it we would have had to apply a label and so I guess labels are what you think they are they're labels and that way we could associate it I'm not going to that here today I think that's fine but I will copy this just in case anybody else wants to do that and um we'll go ahead and save our changes okay and this really doesn't want to push here today I'm not sure why get push what doesn't it like um oh push protection okay it detects something here oh is my token in here wow that's cool it actually detected it so that because we turned on security scanning earlier it would not let me do that that's awesome I wish we I I thought I was showing that earlier so don't show token actually what we have to do uh is we can even just push the old one we have to amend uh the last one we had so if we go over here uh I'm going to have to go ahead and amend this so I'm trying to figure out if there's a way I can just quickly amend um I'm going to get rid of this change here first I'm just going to say discard this change and I'm going to type in get commit hyphen hyphen amend and so now uh what I should be able to do is go into here for all changes right and I should just change it actually no that'll just amend the message sorry that's not going to do what we want uh what we actually need to do here is we out of amend mode I think we are yeah um I'm going to do get reset uh soft head Tilda one and what that will do is bring the changes back into here and so now I can go back and fix that but that's really good that uh I had the the secret scanner turned on do not commit your GitHub token but we did also delete it so it's less of a problem as well uh GitHub packages so just be really really careful with that stuff okay and there you go so I'll see you the next one okay ciao so for a GitHub repo under the insights tab you can gain lots of statistical graphs about the repo and so insights contains the following tabs we got pulse this is an overview of recent activity contributors a list contributors and their activity stats Community standards uh commits code frequency dependency graph Network forks and I want to point out that on the exam they definitely I had to know the contents of some of these which I think is really silly but that's how they did the exam and so it's important that you pay close attention here of what kind of stuff can show up on these pages so you can identify uh which uh category of um graphs they're talking about here or charts or whatever you want to call them um and I noticed that repo insights is not listed as available in the free tier but I think if it's a public repo it shows up so maybe they're talking about for private repos I didn't thoroughly test it but I just wanted to point that out about um about that there let's go take a look at all of these in more detail the first is pulse this contains poll requests open close ratio issues open close ratio summary of activity uh graph of top contributors list of merge pull requests list of issues closed list of issues open list of unresolved conversations remember this one because this one will help you narrow down or rule out the rest because this one is a little bit more complex than other ones uh then we have contributors this contains a graph of all commits over a time period a graph of a specific contributor commits over a time period then we have Community standards this is a checklist of uh of recommended I spelled that wrong but recommended Community standards and how much a community profile has completed this graph will only show for repos that have Community profiles so Community profiles are open source projects on GitHub and I think you have to turn it on to turn yours into uh Community profile file okay we have repo insights so this contains a number of commits per week for the last 52 weeks for a year that's how many weeks there are in a year so that kind of makes sense the average number of commits by day uh of the week uh for the selected week then we have um code frequency this contains the amount of additions and deletions of a code uh a code repo or sorry of code to a to a report per month I really wrote that weird but you get the idea that you have additions and deletion over time and I noticed that for really large repos they can't even render it so this is not really useful for large open source projects but um you can see it in smaller projects and that's what I I said right there down at the bottom uh we have dependency graph this contains list of dependencies list of dependence and Export software bills of materials also known as sbmo SB so security and compliance teams increasingly request software bills of materials to identif ify opensource components of their software projects they assess their vulnerability to emerging threats and verify alignment with license policies so sounds like a good thing for security folks um then we have the network graph this thing is super useful um especially when you're working on uh like or you're utilizing an open source project and something goes wrong I will jump into this and try to find uh other commits from other other branches or Forks to to get the functionality that I need in my application so this will show The 100 most recent pushed Forks you can read the commits to determine the difference of these Forks um then we have Forks itself so this contains a list of fork filterable Forks very similar to the last one but this is just a a list of forks and the other one is over um over time and it's visualized but yeah I just want to point out that you do need to know these ones uh even though again I think it's a bit silly but but yeah you're going to have to know specifically like what they're doing on these um on these on these Pages or graphs okay hey it's Andrew Brown and in this fall along we're just going to take a look at repo insights so what I want to do is go to a popular repository like Ruby on Rails that has a lot of activity and take a look at what their insights look like so the first is puls and you really need to know pulse because again on exam they might ask you about this one in particular uh if you notice here we can change the scope so we can say 1 month 24 days um this one's going to show us here um open versus closed I believe so we have open and closed pull requests and open and closed issues red being closed I'm going to ass purple is closed and green is open now we have some summaries merged pulled requests open pull requests close Issues new issues these here are all listed down below so if you click click on this it's going to just jump to that location okay so that's how you know what's all down here these four things are listed down below the nice thing here is this summary so excluding merges 75 authors have published 240 247 commits and 388 commits etc etc so that's kind of like a thing you can put in a PowerPoint then these are your top contributors so the person that was uh doing all the work here is Jonathan Hefner so good job John uh keep up the great work um let's move on so we have contributors these are people that are contributing code and so it shows kind of a histograph of or ticker ticker tape or whatever you want to call it of the amount of commits that they are committing so we have a good idea there and this is for everybody across the top so in 2014 you can see a lot of stuff was happening probably a major refactor was occurring and that's probably why that's so huge there um probably again other Peaks where you're seeing very large things is is they're preparing for new versions of Ruby on Rails we'll go over to community standards checklist cool we'll go to commits um shows us that there was a lot of activity this year in December so in December I mean this we're in January right now at the time of this video but in December you can see they did a lot of work for Christmas and then back here in February they did a lot of work for some reason you can see Monday seems to be the busy day but I'm not sure oh you clicked find out okay before I didn't know like if this is over time but I guess it's like you click it and then it shows you okay code frequency won't show us here okay dependency graph uh things that it's dependent on makes sense Network this will take a little bit of time because this has at least 100 forks we'll give it a moment but I'm telling you this thing is super powerful and I've used it since the day it's existed and it's been around for very long long time um but when you're working on open source projects and you're having issues you can bet your buttons that somebody else is already fixed it and you can just go look at their commits and figure that stuff out so yeah we'll let that keep loading and while that's loading we'll open a new tab we'll take a look at Forks so here's all our Forks okay we can sort based on stuff uh and hopefully the exam won't ask you about what you can filter by they they do that for issues for some weird reason but uh come back here and so we can see this is rails right and so if we go over here we can see oh this person's doing something make the this relation model delegation strictor they have a work in progress here we go down here add a read me something in another language update screenshot and getting started with rails but sometimes yeah fix style code sometimes people find like bugs and before they even get fixed they'll be in someone else's fork and so you can grab them and just keep working but uh yeah that is um insights we can take a look and see if we get any insights in our teeny tiny repos we'll go to this one here and we get insights and so we already have some stuff here we can see a few different Andrew Browns notice here that shows exam Pro Dev the reason why is that you can have um uh you can like if I'm on my computer my computer which is here uh it can have a different get email and name set so even though it is from this account which it was it can show a different person was contributing so just be aware of that but anyway yeah that is repo insights see you in the next one ciao so in GitHub we are able to create ourselves issues and it's pretty straightforward you just need a title and description and we can also create it via the GitHub CL Li um there's not really much else to say about creating issues um but there you go okay all right let's do a comparison between issues discussions and poll requests it's very important to understand or distinguish these three things because they seem kind of similar but uh they're not um so the first is issues they are for tracking tasks bugs enhancements and other actionable items then you have discussions these are facilitating conversations and q&as about a wide range of topics related to uh the project and then you have P request proposing reviewing and merging code changes in the codebase so on the issue side this is often linked to code changes and can be linked to PRS for discussions you have categorized by topics can be converted to an issue but really it just creates an issue with a soft link to the issue so it doesn't really have the same kind of relationship that an issue would have with a PR um it's not directly linked to code changes um so again discussions are really for as it's implied Community uh engagement or uh conversation around your repo um we have for pull requests directly linked to code changes can be linked to issues now I should point out that when you have the numbering for issues it has like one 2 3 four five your poll request will I think pull from the same pool of numbers we'll test that to make sure that's the case um and so uh just understand that when you reference issues or pull requests um they're pulling from the same number pool okay there you go so what I want to do in this video is I want to prove a theory that the issues and pull requests are pulling from the same number pool in terms of when they're incrementing so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over uh to our GitHub examples repo um and I want to create a new issue and make note of the number that is is used so we're going to go here and I'm just going to say uh create a new um issue okay and we'll create this and notice that we have the number seven okay so we have the number seven so the question is if we were to use a new poll request create a new poll request what would we get so I'm going to make a new pull request and I technically have some code that I can merge it if you don't then you'll have to make some but I'm going to go ahead and create this new pull request and this will be Andre Brown into the exam Pro repo go all the way down the bottom or maybe all the way to the top sorry and we're going to go ahead and create that new portal request and just say more changes okay and let's make note of the number the number here is five we go over to issues the last one that we created in our um oh sorry the PO C over here is five Okay so that didn't make for a very good example because it went the other way so what I'll need to do is I want to delete this pull request this one's kind of useless we'll close that and what I actually need is I need some kind of change in this repo to go the other way all right because I need to see if that other number is going to increment we'll go back to this main repo and remember we created this issue this issue number was seven and so I want to see what the next PR in here is going to be we did just close this one but maybe we need a PR for just something locally not something across across uh Forks okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and go to code and I'm going to go to branches and I need to just move over to another Branch we have some junk branches here I'm just going to go ahead and delete them okay and I'll even get rid of this one here we don't need that I'm G to give this a refresh and so now what I want to do is create a new branch I'm just going to just say um number test and so this will be off of Main and then what we can do is go over to our code and I just need to make some kind of change so I'll I'll switch over to number test and what I want to do here is I want to just change something so I'm going to go into our get crash course go our hello and I'm going to go edit this file I We'll add another X Mark we'll commit those changes and so now we have a reason to make a pull request we'll make a new pull request and this one I just want it to be in the current repo I don't want to go uh somewhere else so very straightforward here here to there and let's make note of the number that is used so here it's using the number eight so I want to show you this is seven and this is eight so they are indeed pulling from the same number pool so so just so you know like you might expect clean numbers as you're going up with your issues and you're like what happened to this number is it unlucky number did GitHub get rid of it no it's probably over in your pull request okay we can also link pull request we'll probably do this later again but you can link your issues to your pull requests um if you go to development here on the right hand side you can just click here and Associate this way so I can go here and then choose a poll request it's not showing up for some reason do we not have a requests over here we do it's right here yeah go back over here development oh did I click the I clicked the wrong repo that's why and so I can choose this one here and we'll apply it so now this is linked um to that there and it shows the link there as well you might able be able to link them up here as well I'm not exactly sure so what I'm going to do I just want to unlink that for a second okay and I want to see what happens if we were to um if we were to go and update this and then put in like it says closes eight right and we do this would this link it I mean we have eight here it's showing there okay and Link a poll request that it now is closed so did it just do that like I'm not 100% sure did it do that I'm going to go ahead and just delete this for a second edit update because I can't tell but that's what I want to know so what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this one more time and delete this issue okay and I want to see if that takes any kind of effect so we'll make a new one we'll just say uh cool issue it'll say closes pound 8 okay I just want to see if it's linked in any way so it doesn't look like it's linking any way there but it could be that um a particular commit could close a ticket for sure um but I thought something with poll requests would happen here but anyway what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to edit this to say my cool issue and what I want to do is I want to see when we close this poll request when we close this poll request will it close this ticket okay so a link of poll request now that will close this ticket so we'll go over here and I'm going to go here and I want to merge and Pull and confirm now we could just close it but I don't think that's the same thing so I'm going to go over to our issue and I think our issue's now been closed so it was closed when we closed that pull request another thing we we should check is is using keywords there's something called keywords issues I think could also be in PRS GitHub using keywords in issues and polar request suggesting that it could be used for either or so to link a poll request to an issue show the fix automatically closes when someone merges the poll request type one of the following keywords followed by a a reference issue so close the issue when someone merges the poll request okay so that's something we could try doing when someone merges the poll request so what I'm going to do is I'm going to reopen this issue and um by the way just because we have a pull request doesn't mean we can't you uh push to It Again by like you can use a p request and push well we'll talk about that when we get in the pull request section I don't want to confuse anybody here so I'm going to go back over to uh here I'm going to switch back to number test and we're going to go into get crash course and we're going to go into hello we're going to edit uh I guess it's already here can we just edit it right there no edit another exclamation mark commit the changes commit it good we're going to go over to PLL request make a new pull request and uh keep it real simple we want to go to the keeping the same repo and we want this to be number test we'll create that pull request and I mean I want this to close but it says when we merge here it says to link a request to an issue show that the fixes in progress or automatically closes the issue when someone merges so I'm going to say fixes I and we're going to put a pound here this will be cool issue that's our new one and I want to see if that links it in any weird way it's not weird but in some way so I'm going to go back over to my issues we'll take a look here and notice it says link a poll request now that will close this issue so you know it was saying that it had to be at the time of merge but did does it really because it looks like it just has to be somewhere in the comment here to link it so links pull request to issue but not the other way around right so it has to be in in that uh Direction okay um so I think that's really important to note the other thing is that the exam will probably ask you to remember these words notice we have close fix resolve close fix resolve if you can remember that then you'll be able to pick it out in a list because they might show like just closes and then fixed and then resolves and try to mess with your mind uh but understand those three there but hopefully that gives you a little bit more uh information about issues um very obvious things you can assign people to an issue you can apply labels to an issue if you want you can uh associate to a project you can associate to a milestone and we saw that it can be part of a branch and a pull request um all pretty clear stuff we can pin issues I'm sure we'll talk about that later on but if I pin it it will then go to the top here if I go back over to my issues here it is a few other things things um is the the Sorting stuff here you really should know how to filter uh filter with some of these options here and I'm going to just tell you on the exam they they said Hey how do you filter issues like what options do you have to filter and they gave you a list and you had to pick from them I really didn't like that thought it was kind of a dirty question but that was something you might have to answer you might have to know this query language a little bit so just understand that those might show up on the exam but definitely linking is something that we show in the exam for sure um and creating a branch okay so hopefully that gives you a better idea of issues there all right ciao so something you can do is you can create um a branch from an issue and or you can associate an issue to a branch uh what you can do is you can go ahead and create a branch on your issue then it will allow you to uh name the branch notice that it's going to have the number of the issue in front of it which is a common convention when making feature branches so people know what issues or ticket it goes back to this is not just with GitHub this is with any project tracker that has to do with code a common workflow is creating feature or bug uh branches but Define your issues up front and then you quickly create those branches and that way you don't forget to make those branches creates great habits so you define the feature bug then you go ahead and you make the branch there you go hey this is Angie Brown and this fall along I want to create a uh Branch from an issue we've probably done it before but let's do it again because maybe we'll learn something different if we do it slightly different um and it seems to be a very important topic for the exam so we do have this issue from before I'm just going to go ahead and close this as this one is uh done and I'm going to go back up here and we'll make a new issue we'll call this issue cooler issue issue right cooler issue and what I want to do is I want to create a branch so what's interesting is you can link a branch you can link a branch or a pull request I think we've created a branch this way but we've never uh done it the other way so let's just go ahead and create a branch and you can see that's pretty straightforward I don't think that's super exciting um notice that the branch has to be one of the branches you have here uh so sorry I guess you could actually associate to an existing Branch so um repository destination change Branch Source oh sorry what you're branching from okay that's what that's for but yeah we can create a branch there pretty straightforward uh but let's do this the other way we're going to go ahead and create the branch first and then connect an issue to it so I'm going to go here and I'm going to say new super cool Branch super cool and we'll go ahead and do that we'll go ahead and create our issue this will be whoops this will be our super cool issue right and I'll just put cool in here that's emojis that's how you use them and uh what we can do here is then click here and it says link Branch or poll request most times we've been doing this with poll requests but we'll do this with um uh a branch now and so look at the icon that tells you what it is so these are um these blue ones I I pretend like I know these blue ones are our um branches these purple ones are our pull requests and this green one here is I have no idea is that another issue can you link issues to other issues can you no that's not that that is so that's something what is that is it like an old one no I know we made that what is it number test number test what is that okay we should find well what that is we'll go here and so now we've applied a branch the other direction okay but uh I really want to know what that number testing is it's another Branch okay so then why was it colored differently that's what I want to know maybe it was a branch maybe it's a branch that's been merged in before that's probably why so that's probably what they're doing so they're both branches it's just that branch has already been merged again so you'd be using an Old Branch that You' that you've already done I think that's what they're trying to indicate there they don't really like tell you about these uh icons anywhere if they are in the documentation they are super hidden but I want to go back here and take a look see now this one's blue this one's blue yeah so these ones I think are ones that have been um number test green so green is it's already been merged in you can see the icon it shows that it looks like it's been merged in and it shows that it's a branch so this is actually a uh a branch that has been merged okay but uh yeah hopefully we learned something new or we got a bit extra practice and I'll see you in the next one okay ciao so with search and filters you can quickly sort through a lot of your issues there's a bunch of predefined ones that are there or you can use a syntax language uh called the advanced search syntax and roll up to find uh something more advanced the exam at least for me absolutely asked me both the syntax and the predefined filters um and specifically they use the filter names that were here so um with those but there's also sorting right so I'm not showing that here but they I also got an exam question asking me about what you could sort by uh but uh yeah you definitely need to know all those three things and we'll take a close closer look on maybe a bigger repo so that we can get some practice okay hey it's Andrew Brown and this fall along we're going to look at how to search and filter issues so I'm going to make my way over to rails because they should have a lot of issues 49 455 that's not a small amount and let's take a look at what we can filter by so we have open issues and pull requests so we can do that we have your issues so things that your assigned to we have your pull requests which I'm confused why oh you know what it is it's flipping between the two things so it's suggesting that these interfaces are the same I didn't even notice that okay so your pro request notice we change tabs we go back to your issues over here we have everything assigned to you and then everything you're mentioned in okay so assigned mentioned the ones you opened and then things that are open for po requester issues it's weird that like they have this one join but this one's separate I have no idea why um another thing that we should make note of is these filters here because they might say hey are you able to filter based on Project hey are you able to filter based on aign or sort or filter so these are basically um these are broad filters and then these are um very specific filters like very very specific and then we have our sort over here where we can sort some stuff but yeah you'll need to know this stuff uh this and the advanced search syntax so I I have some written out here we can play around with it a bit and see what we can do so let's see what we can do we can say is issue and that seems to be a thing so we'll go ahead and hit enter there so yes it's an issue um we could say no assigning okay so nobody's assigned to it we could put label active support so we're filtering based on this one here let's see if that works cool and I wonder if we could do like some generic text search um so maybe we could just say replace on the end here and notice that it's picking up I think that like let's try caches caches okay so we're kind of getting that it might be the contents of it but it is trying to search for it we could also say something like there's zero comments so let's say comments zero so those ones have zero comments and so that gives you an idea of how uh that works um so you know hopefully that is pretty straightforward but yeah the filters is the same for pull requests and issues um and you know if there's more to it we could click here and you can read through all the options uh but for the most part you can pretty much figure it out and guess based on what kind of options you have over here that you could filter by but you'll see you in the next one okay ciao so issue templates are markdown templates that are preloaded for new issues they help ensure users creating issues provide all relevant and expected information and if the exam if want to use the exam language there was a exam question that says you can coarse terrible word but cerse people into writing what you want them to write so here is an example it's a markdown template that's all it's really doing is loading in that markdown template and the idea is that they you can have different issue templates so a new category will appear here of issue and then people open it up from there some of these are kind of linked to stuff so like that report to vulnerability is not necessarily an issue template um but bug report and feature request are but they're like builtin ones I should point out that on the exam they'll probably ask you what are the three default ones and these are the three so you should remember report bug or bug report feature request and uh report security vulnerability because now that they remembering it they def definitely asked me that um you create issue templates here in that folder so you make a folder called issue templates all in caps and you put them in there originally used to just have one called issue template. MD some older projects still have that but everything goes in that folder and we're going to find out that issue forms also go in there as well which is the beta replacement for this feature that I never could get working um G GitHub has a wizard guy to easily create issue templates so you don't really have to write um uh markdown there but uh it will spit out markdown but we'll take a look at what that looks like uh since I haven't used it in a while but we'll find out here shortly okay let's take a look at issue forms this is the evolution of issue templates and it uses a yaml formatted file to create issue forms for stricter entry for issue information as the time of this video this is a beta feature so it might go away what's odd is that they want to include it in the exam so beta features can can appear in uh GitHub certifications which I disagree with but that's what they're doing and so here is an example of the template I don't think they'll ask you the format of the template um like GitHub actions they'll definitely do but not for issue forms because it's so new and that's kind of a visualization of what that would look like so there you go hey this is angrew brown and this fall along we're going to take a look at issue templates and we'll try to do issue forms I never got working the first time I tried it but maybe it'll work this time around let's go take uh uh a peek and see who would might have some existing uh issue templates I know rails does but the thing is rails is such an old um or mature product that they've had this template this issues template file in here forever and they don't have it in the uh the place where you expect it to be so it would be in the dock GitHub folder but it's right here they don't have a a um a folder of them so this is actually the old way so they say you're using an old version of issue template use the new way of doing it so that's not recommended anymore okay but um maybe a better project might be like Forum uh if forum's still around and kick in because I feel like they would utilize this if we go over to our issues let's say we want to make a new issue we have um this one this one looks like a template okay so maybe this is a template that they're using and we have that format there and we might just steal this so we can save some time later on so I'm going to leave this tab open I just don't feel like making a new one and if we go over to their code let's take a look and see what they have in their GitHub folder and in here they have issue template and there it is they also have a config AML so there's a little bit more going on there than than I thought um is that is this the new style that looks like an issue for I think that's an issue form okay well maybe we'll grab both of theirs and see if we can get these both to work but I didn't see that when we opened an issue let's go back here and take a look new issue um I don't see it so I'm not 100% sure on that but if it's a yaml file then that's what it should be unless that's something else and I'm just maybe it's something else I don't know so anyway let's go ahead and do that for our own repo so I'm going to go here into GitHub GitHub examples and I'm going to actually open this up in GitHub Dev I can do that by hitting the period by the way if you hit comma it doesn't do anything um just going to try that I don't know I'm just convinced maybe a comma does something it doesn't do anything we'll hit period and that's going to open up here and I want to go onto the left hand side and we're going to make a new folder here we're going to call this dog ignore or sorry dog ignore doget Hub that's a file that's not a folder let's try that again we'll say new folder. GitHub and then inside of that we'll make a new folder called it issue template is that what it's supposed to be called issue template yes yeah and then I'll make a new one in here and we'll say um I'm trying to think of something secret we'll call this secret MD and I mean I said I was going to copy this I guess we don't really need to we just make our own and I'm just going to put anything in here so just say welcome to the secret uh submissions submit to Secrets okay I don't know if that's a thing I'm just going to put cool here I think that should render out because that's uh that's something there and I'm going to go ahead and add this commit or add issue template go ahead and commit and pull good I want to go back to this repo I'll open another tab here and if I go open an issue do we have it it didn't show us uh options must have done something wrong let's go back here do GitHub issue template do GitHub issue template I made an MD file yeah I don't understand it looks right to me okay so we'll go back over here maybe we got something wrong that's okay and we'll rename this I mean I don't think so secret. MD what if we um refresh the page I'm just going to do a hard refresh here I just don't trust it new issue R up to any issue templates okay let's go to our settings well hold on is this repo private or public because that could matter this is a um oh this is a private repo I think you cannot change the visibility of this Fork is this public or private no it's it's public oh I'm um I've added this here this is my Fork yeah it is here but it's not showing up here maybe it only works if it's on the the main one so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a pull request and uh we're going to just create a new one and uh update and just say update here going create that one and maybe that's going to resolve our issue I don't want to get confused no we only have one pull request and we'll go over to this one I think it's because it's a fork and so maybe it only works on the the top level one and we'll go ahead and we'll just merge this P request and now we'll take a look and see what happens so we'll go to Issues new new issue no it's not showing us anything it's a public repo it's in the right folder what else does it want from me let's go here um yeah what could I be doing wrong that is a good question is because this is not a community project okay issue templates not working this is a legacy workflow to create issue templates we recommend using the upgraded issue template Builder okay if you use a legacy workflow to manually do that well let's click on that create an issue template you can create an issue template as an issue template subdirectory uh in any of the supported folders to contain multiple issues so it can be in multiple folders okay do GitHub I swear I've done this before to make it issue template visible in the repository do this commit the changes I'm like going crazy here because I definitely I made it um and use the template query parameter to specify the template that will fill the issue body okay do we need maybe a um a like maybe we need a yaml file let's go back over to form I don't think so do we need some front matter maybe in the yeah that might be something we need in the in the file here yeah okay you know what we're missing we're just missing some front matter that's what it is that's what it is okay so I'm going to go back over to this one I guess and what we need is some front matter in here and that's why it's not working front matter is um is this it can go into yaml files I think or maybe not markdown files and this is like yaml stuff you put the top here so just just say secret secret uh secret issue submits a secret um and I think the idea here is you can automatically assign labels so maybe we have like a secret label we'll have to make a label for that because we don't have one uh want to go back to oh let's use that command I'm going to do control K there we go I love this and I'm going to type in um examples just like a fast way to navigate to stuff I got remember to do that more um and we want to make a new label over here I'm going to call this one secret I'm on the wrong repo control K I'm G to try this again example I want mine why is it only showing this one all right well I guess that feature is not as great as I thought it was we'll go over here and I'll go to issues and then I'll go to labels and I'll add a new one called secret and choose something crazy maybe that okay so there's our new secret I don't need any signies we'll leave that blank we'll save that update issue template commit and push we'll go back over here and now we go to issues and we say new issue there we go now what's interesting is that we weren't getting those three default ones which I'm really surprised if we go to edit templates okay they go there but they usually have like a builder I remember them having a builder before and I don't know where it is now so that's really interesting well we can go back to the other one like this works I'm sure this works we fill it in there it is what I'm surprised is we don't have those three default ones there and I know again on the exam they showed that and I could have swore that they would have set you up with that but maybe it only happens if this is a community project which again I'm not even sure how to uh set that up um I kind of forget so place to set community project Community project yeah I'm not sure um insights Community oh here it is to enable discussions uh enable discussions to unlock Community insights okay sure we'll enable that I don't really want to enable that right now but maybe that's what would bring those issues in later we can go check I'm just again I just want to see why I can't see those default ones and we'll go here and we'll go back to this repo uh GitHub examples and well first I just want to open an issue over here no templates fine let's go over to community again issue templates add what if we click it here okay so this is where the Builder is it's weird that um it didn't show another place okay so here's some a couple of the default ones so we can go here and do this and then there's custom template so maybe these are the three ones because I said the other one was like vulnerability one but maybe it's these three because it was trying to ask you like what were the default ones that were there so I think maybe I was wrong in that slide and it's really custom template we'll go ahead and we'll just propose those changes and say continue and now if we go over to issues all right that looks fine I wonder have a little icon there maybe there's some way to do that now we can edit the templates over here not really though I thought we could do a little bit more there but we now have uh those in here secrets in here as well but of course this one doesn't have a front matter that's why it's not working we're going to go back and switch over to our old one here and um what I want to do is I want to try to get that issue form work because I've never gotten one of those working before so I'm going to look up issue form and I want to just give it another go on GitHub here issue form I'm just looking for an example one so here's an example of one I'm going to grab this whole one here I'll copy it I'm going to go back over to here and I'm going to make a new one we'll just call this one extra MD it's actually yaml okay we'll paste this in we'll save it and we'll just say extra bug report at the top so it can distinguish it from the other one and we'll go ahead and Commit This try and add an issue form like I like the idea of issue forms but uh you know again beta feature so why why is it in the exam um and we'll see if we can get this to work this was committed on this one here so I'm going to go back over to uh this one come on let me I have like a my my mouse is sticking that's why I'm getting a double click okay and actually I'm in the count that I want to be I'm just trying to get to that repo again so click over here and we'll go back into ours and now we'll go to issues and I want to see if that other one shows up it does okay finally and now we actually have those fields so that's pretty nice um before I had like the hardest time getting this to work but now it's working no problem so I think that covers it for issue forms and issue templates and I will see you in the next one ciao so for GitHub issues you're able to pin them and you can pin up to three once you pin them they show up the top and it makes it really easy uh to find the most important issues that's pretty much it okay hey this is Angie Brown and we are taking a look at poll requests often abbreviated as PR and you'll see that a lot it's very common uh is a formal process to put forth changes that can be manually or automatically reviewed before it's accepted into your base Branch your main branch here so here are pull requests in GitHub and the benefits of pull requests is collaboration review or collaborative review so enhances code quality through team discussions and peer feedback chck it it tracks changes says change tracking but tracks changes provides a record of code changes and related discussions automated testing enables integration with tools for automated checks and tests controlled integration manages safe and reviewed merging of code changes open source friendly simplifies contributions and collaboration in open source projects I want to point out the poor request is not necessarily A git feature but a a workflow and GitHub has built a bunch of features around pull requests pull requests aren't unique to GitHub um it's just part of the workflow and and whatever they want to build around it they can build around it and that has to do with other tools that do this like Jura and bit bucket or whatever other tools like gitlab and stuff okay so we can create pull requests using the GitHub CLI uh that's one really cool way of doing it the other way is using uh the GitHub website so you go to the pull request Tab and your repo you create a new pull request and there it is I'm sure you know by now how to create a pull request because it's almost impossible not to show you that a 100 times over before we got to P requests here but that's how you create them one thing I want to point out is um uh that we have to set a base this is who we're going to merge into and ahead who uh the changes that we're going to pull into notice it says compare and we'll talk about that in the next slide about base and compare okay so base and compare determines the direction of the merge for a pull request and the idea is we have the base so is who you want to merge into this is usually the main branch or an environment specific Branch doesn't have to be main but usually main is base right um then we have compare this is what will be merg into base uh compare is choosing the head reference so notes before I called it head and if you look very closely it says choose the head reference so that's what compare is is this is usually a bug or feature Branch another thing that I need to point out is that you can compare across Forks uh this is useful if you're trying to contribute to an open source project so you're going to have the option to Cho the base uh repository um and the HUD repository to different uh repos from different owners so there you go so a draft pull request on GitHub is a feature that allows you to open a requests but Mark it as a work in progress uh the use cases for draft pull requests would be indicating work in progress so communicates the pull request is not ready for review or merging preventing premature merging ensures incomplete work is not accidentally merged facilitating early feedback and collaboration so people can talk about it continuous integration testing so maybe you want to just run uh a test code because when you have a pull request it's automatically going to start doing that transitioning to a ready state so easily switch from a draft to a ready for final review and merging organizing work in priorities help in managing and tracking ongoing work in large projects um draft requests draft pull request is a feature only for GitHub organization teams I believe you can use it in the uh free um free organizations that are public so we'll take a look and see if that's even possible uh if if I don't make a video then you know that it wasn't um there are two things you need to remember for this for the exam uh draft P requests cannot be merged code owners are not automatically requested to review draft pull requests okay so remember those two things because they will show up on your exam ciao hey this is Andrew Brown and in this fall along I want to take a look and see if we are able to open up a draft PLL request in our GitHub organization free account that we created so what I'm going to do is make a new repo because we're going to need to need we're going to need to have one in our um our one here and actually you know what I'm going to do no no no I'm just going to uh I don't want to make it too complicated I'm just going to make a new repost so just say uh like fun repo we'll say fun repo okay and this can be public we're going to make it public so just in case we need to have that so we can have that functionality because a lot of times public allows us to have um that paid functionality for free so what I want to do is take a look here and create a new pull request and see if we have the option we don't have any code so we'll need to create ourselves a new Branch I'm going to just do that in here in the UI and we'll just say uh Dev and we'll create that branch and then from here we'll go over and I want to switch over to Dev and then I want to edit the read me here and I'm just going to put in some exclamation marks we're going to commit that change looks good to me and then we're going to make our way over to pull request and we'll make a new pull request and what I want to know is if I can make a draft pull request so we'll say create new pull request and we'll drop this down and there it is okay so that's all it takes to create a draft pull request if there are code owners assigned they can't touch it noce I cannot merge it I'm clicking like a maniac it's not going to happen and that is draft pull requests so there you go let's talking about linking activity within a poll request so you can link issues to a poll request so that the state of the poll request will automatically close the issue we actually already did this before we looked at issues during we looked at issues and we're looking at it again so the idea is that you go up to development on that Cog and you choose um the issue or sorry the PLL request and then they're linked okay so that will close it the other way is via those supported keywords so if you have any of those words you put in the comment of the actual poll request um then that will close it it says the poll request EST must be on the default Branch okay the poll poll request must be on the default Branch for it to work I don't know if that's true I mean it worked for me when we did it but um however we did I guess it was on the default Branch but um uh anyway that's that I don't think there's any point of us showing this again because we've done it so many times but hopefully you know that you can do that and the direction to which it happens you're putting it in the uh body the description of the poll request um so it links to the issue okay ciao let us take a look here at the different statuses a poll request can be surprisingly this isn't an exam question but it's something you should know so let's go through them all the first is open the default status when a pull request is created it's open for discussion review draft indicates the P request is a work in progress and not ready for review close the P request has been closed without being merged this status is used when the proposed changes are no longer needed or the branch has been rejected merged the pull request changes has been merged into the target Branch the status indicates a successful conclusion of the pull request process change is requested this status is used during the review process when a reviewer request changes before the poll request can be merged review required indicates that the poll request requires a review before it can be merged this status is common in repos where reviews are mandatory part of the work flow approved the pull request has been reviewed and approved for merging by the required number of VI of reviewers conflict indicates that there are conflicts between the PLL request branch and the target branch that needs to be res resolved before merging ready for review a poll request initially marked as draft can be changed to this status once it's ready for review so that gives you an idea of the functionality of it and you kind of figure this out as you are working with PO requests but there you go so commenting in pull requests which is basically saying reviewing in pull requests because comments really do link up to reviewing but the idea is that uh you can um make a comment and in particular you can have it so that it is reviewing changes so when you are reviewing changes a review change a review can be a comment it can be an approval it can be request changes which has a comment attached to it so hopefully that is clear um that when you're doing P requests a comment is a review in sense okay it's submits General feedback without explicitly approval okay um another thing I need to note is that you can uh Mark comments on specific lines of code that could require a review to begin so there could be one where you're just saying something about the code or you could literally be saying hey you have to do something about this before we'll accept it okay so the code owners file is a GitHub specific file that defines individuals or teams that are responsible for specific code in a repo and so the idea is that they have the syntax that's similar to get ignore and when a polar request is open that modifies any files matching a pattern in the code owner's file get help automatically re request a review from the specified code owner the code owner files go in either the root project root. GitHub folder or doc directory um and so yeah I think this is something that is a paid feature it probably could be in free if we're talking about um organizations teams or sorry like free organizations that have to take a look but yeah it is a very powerful feature okay so when you're merging a poll request there are a few options so we have this drop down where we can either create a merge this will bring all commits over into the repo we have squash emerge which will have one commit to be added we have rebase emerge which will be added it and then do a rebase the third one is a more complex one so if you're not familiar with rebase you're probably going to be looking towards squash which is a good one uh the use case depends on your team's workflow they may prefer only a single commit uh added and so that's why you would want to have squash or rebase um but you do have a lot of options there for how you want to bring code in uh to your uh your base um your base there required reviewer is a way for you to explicitly say hey these people have to review this code otherwise it won't be accepted um and so you can assign or allow multiple required reviewers before code uh gets into a repo and a lot of times you can say it can't be the same person uh that submitted the code and it's not uncommon to have like four or five people that can be required reviewers and two or three have to um look it over before it gets accepted so here um I would be assigning myself and saying okay Omen King this this user has to um review the code and then from there as that user I would have to approve the changes and then from there it would change it to saying okay Omen king or angre brown approve the changes and so now you'll be able to press that merge button okay so there you go hey this is angrew brown in this video I want to uh do a little bit more with polar requests terms of code reviews and maybe we could try to get that code owners file to work or um you know just things that we didn't get a chance to really get HandsOn with as we have made PLL requests quite a bit but not from a reviewing kind of code proper way so what I want to do is I want to make my way over to our um uh our pretend organization and we're going to go ahead and create ourselves a new repo unless we already have one like the fun repo does that still exist it does so what will we'll do is go ahead and use this one and what I want to do before we do anything else is I want to add um or make sure that the collaborator is added uh to this repo here and so I'm going to go ahead and add Omen King okay and there I am and I'm going to go ahead and say this person can maintain this repo all right and now they're part of this repo so they're there and the reason I was able to add that very quickly was because they were already part of a team so or sorry that they're already part of our organization so I didn't have to send an invite and confirm they're not external from that so that was very easy um the next thing I want to do is I want to go through and uh create a pull request it looks like we already have one here so if we already have one I'm not going to make a new one if you have to you make a new one but here it says this poll request oh this is that draft one right so we can't do anything with this one right now uh so I'm just going to close that poll request I'm going to go over here a poll request I'm going to try to make a new poll request because we still might have yes we do from earlier and I'm going to go ahead and create that pull request okay and so we'll create that one and I want to say that this has to be reviewed by Omen King as soon as I do that notice we cannot proceed forward until that's uh ready there's another thing here that says ready for review so this pull request is still a work in progress so it's suggesting that this is a draft I guess I didn't notice but um it probably was still set to draft and so I ready for review okay so now uh Omen King should know that they need to approve it for this to work okay another thing that we could do is we could uh um require other things for approval so we could go ahead and add a Rule and Rule sets allow us to do that so there might be some things in here that we could set um require status checks to pass so that might be something that we might want to do and right now we don't actually have any status checks and so that's the reason why we can't we can't add that there so if I go back okay it would be nice to get some checks in here because that's the real value of pull request is having some kind of automation thing in here but I suppose we'd have to have like GitHub actions or something else so maybe we'll leave that for when we get to GitHub actions and integrate it there and we'll just continue on with the reviewers here so um I'm going to switch to my other account and I'm in this uh repon and saying oh I need to add a review so I can go here and let's say I don't like this change I'm G to go here and say request changes I don't like it make it better and so if I do this okay now it's saying in red hey you got to do something I you like it's not allowed to go through um and by the way it show it still shows merge pull request and I really don't want this to show up unless I've accepted it so maybe there's a setting that we can do in here I thought it would been that rule set that we could do that maybe there's something else that we can do to protect it always suggest updating the pull request branch no operation options I might not be able to do it because I'm not the admin so I'm going to go back and switch over to this I'll go back to settings and what I'm looking for is the option to say that it requires uh reviewers or otherwise it cannot be merged um and so that's what I'm looking for right now maybe it's under uh rules could be Branch protection as well let's take a look here require a pull request before merging um I really thought that there would have been a rule for this the reason I think that is because I'm used to um I'm used to uh using jira and and bit bucket and and they'll let you do that so maybe I can't set that I'm not sure restrict creation yeah so I'm really surprised I can't find that maybe it's there but I can't find it and that's totally fine let's go ahead and pretend uh you know we're going to go fix this issue so we go here and it says I don't like it make it better so how can we um submit that fix right and the way we're going to do that is we'll actually have to go to this branch and change something so we'll go here and make sure we're in the correct branch and in here I'm just going to go ahead and change it again okay commit the change commit and so now if we go back to the poll request we should be able to up update this poll request so I'm trying to do that here FSE changed normally what happens like and again it's because I'm thinking of jur and ATL scene is that you'd open another pull request and it would be the same one the same spot so I'm not sure if we can do that uh if I go Dev here because it's the same Branch right so if I do this it says view pull request how do I do this um and again it's because I'm expecting it to act like uh another piece of software and it's not doing what I think it's doing review changes I mean I could review my own that makes no sense review in code space so I guess the way it's going to work I really thought there'd be a back and forth there but I guess there's not is I suppose I would just have to go here and then approve it looks great okay so yeah I guess there's less process there than I thought and now that I'm happy with it I can go ahead and merge it so next question is can we make a code owner file and see how that works because I think that would be kind of unique to do sorry and so I believe that file is called code owners and uh what I'm going to do so I'm going to go ahead and create myself a new file here we'll say new file I'm going to say code owners and I'm just going to put an ason here and just say omen King and so the idea is that anytime anything changes it should assign it to Omen king that's what I'm thinking anyway so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and commit to these changes and we'll do this again okay and the idea is that if anything changes from that other person they they send a poll request I'm hoping that it's going to Auto assign now this might not work because it might be only a paid feature I don't know but we're going to try anyway so I'm going to go in the de branch and before I do anything I'm actually going to merge it the other way um I'm going to do that by opening up uh code spaces on dev and I'm just going to merge it back in into the direction because I'm not going to make a p request that goes in the opposite direction I'm not going to do that that doesn't make sense P requests are supposed to go into your main branch right so I'm just giving this a moment here and what I want to do is do get whoops get merge main I'll do get pull I'll do get check out main get pull just in case we'll say get check out main get merge main get push saying it's all up to date I'm not sure if I I'm convinced so I'm going to double check uh it's not showing our tree here so let's say get graph I really wish it would persist changes but hey it's code spaces and I'll go back over to here do I have this now and show it shows that uh Maine is ahead of death so it's totally lying to me they're definitely not in sync I knew this was not the case oh you know what I merged when I was in main so that's probably why uh get check out um Dev get merge main it's always great to have this open so we can see I'm going to go sync those changes okay just in case that didn't I can just get push just in case great that is in good shape I want to stop this environment stop good we're stopping it okay I'll go ahead and close that Tab out so now I have confidence that this code owners is in both I I just had a feeling I need to do that for some reason going to go ahead and just change this and we'll do that I'm going to go ahead and create a new pull request and I want to see whether it auto assigns we go here Dev create a pull request and look it auto assigned it so it says awaiting request a review from Omen Kang Omen Kang is a code owner Omen Kang will be requested when this pull request is created so that means the code owner file is working I don't need to create this pull request to know that and I think that's sufficient um the only last thing I would say is that you know people can comment directly on specific lines just remember that because they might ask you on the exam and that's about it we'll see you in the next one okay ciao hey everyone this is angrew brown and this fall along I want to show you uh some of the more advanced options for poll requests um in terms of the merge options and why you'd use one over the other um so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into our GitHub examples and in this case we do need to open up uh some kind of editor I think we could get away with using it on my keyboard and that's going to open up the editor we're still going to need the repo open so I'm going to go here and wait for this to load and go to repo and so I I'm going to want to go over here for a moment I'm going to get rid of this um pull request so we're not getting mixed up and um I really want to be on development and I actually don't even know if I'm on that so I'm actually going to just close this stuff out I might have mucked this up and we'll close this out because I need to be on the correct Branch for this to work work and I mean we can do this and get up examples I'm going to do this in our other repo sorry I know I'm all over the place but I want to go back to our home and I want to go to our cool repo so I'm going to drop down our whoops our option here and I'm not sure why they don't never show those on the right hand side they really should we'll go here and I'm going to now um open po request and a new tab here and I'm going to go ahead and hit period and the reason why actually you know what we can't use uh GitHub Dev sorry we're going to have to open up code spaces because what I need is that visualization tool so we can see what we're doing so I'm going to go ahead and open up GitHub Cod spaces and we're going to have to wait a little while for this to start up unless it's already running that'd be really nice and I'll be back here in just a second when it loads okay all right so now that is ready um we want to make this a little bit easier to look at so I'm going to switch my theme as per usual we'll go to a darker theme there we go and um the other thing that I want to do here is I want to switch out to the dev Branch so say get check out Dev okay and another thing we're going to need is a tree so I'm going to go ahead and go to extensions here we'll say get graph because we need to make this really clear what's going on uh so I'm going to go here and install this okay and hopefully that installs nice and quick is it here not yet come on get graph install you can do get graph we want you there we go we want you here get graph so the idea is that I want to put a bunch of commits here and then we're going to merge them and see what it looks like when we do that and then we'll try a different merge option and we'll see how much cleaner it is uh doing that another way so what I want to do is I want to go ahead and modify this file save it and go get commit hyphen M change one and we're going to do ma to grab all of them in one go and then I want to get push okay and then we're going to do this again save and I'm going to just do a semicolon so I can just get through this a lot quicker so we'll do that again we'll do that again okay you're getting kind of the idea what's going on here we're kind of crazy people are not going to be happy with all of our commits okay great so now if we go back to our G graph here we got a bunch of changes I guess we should have incremented them it just says 1111 uh we can demend those like there's a way to rename them I don't really want to deal with that but let's just assume we didn't name it all dumb like that we made 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or for the next one we'll we'll just name it two so the idea is that what will happen the question is what Willen happen when we merge this in will we end up with one over here or all of these over here and that's what we're going to find out so we'll create a pull request we'll make a new pull request we will merge Dev to main we'll create that pull request I'm going to switch it back to normal we'll create that pull request we're going to ignore our reviewers we're going to just review it ourself and notice we're on Create and merge commit so we do this and what do we get we go back over to get graph and I'm going to go get fetch because that'll update the graph without pulling anything and now notice that all of these commits um is up here now okay so that is there it didn't squash them all into one we still have all of the history of them okay so just to make this clear I'm going to just go get checkout main get poll get check out Dev get pull because I want to show you that they're all still there okay oh sorry get merge main get poll and refresh okay and I'll just do a get push for our Dev sorry but what I want to show you is that all of this history is still here it's not gone right it's all still here so hopefully that is clear I know it's not the best visual but I'm hoping that makes sense what I want to do now is I want to do a um I want to do a squash okay for the branch so I'm going to just make a new Branch get checkout Dev 2 and actually I'm going to do get checkout hyphen B Dev 2 and then we'll do get uh because we want to push this Branch get push you origin de Dev two and so now it's being remotely check uh tracked and I want to do something really similar to what we were doing before so I'm going to go here and for each one I'm going to remove a line okay we'll save it I'm looking for that one liner there we go and this will just be two this time two and we'll go here save that this will be two and we'll go ahead and save this and this will be two and we'll go ahead and save this and this will be two and we'll go ahead and save this and this will be two all right let's go back to our G graph we have a bunch of this stuff here let's go over here and make a new pull request this time we're going to Dev 2 and we're going to create that pull request and we're going to say create pull request and this time we're going to say merge pull request squash and merge squash and merge it's bringing all those commits in and now if we go back here and we refresh okay um we're going to refresh here again oh I got to go fetch get fetch that's why we don't see anything here get fetch or refresh and so notice now it doesn't show like a merge line coming into here what it's done it's taken all of this stuff and it's squashed it into a new commit and has it over here okay so it really depends on what you want do you want to keep all this history or do you want to kind of have this like over here and this has a completely separated commit here um it's really up to you how you want to do it I think this looks a lot cleaner um but this is totally an option as well it's really what you want to do and I will see you uh in the next one so before I do that I'm just going to stop my workspace all right and see you later ciao poll request templates are similar to issue templates they will populate the poll request text area with the specified markdown template so there it is um I need to point out that uh it's in GitHub requestor template. MD that's what you want to use technically there is a folder called pull request template that you can use but I found that you really couldn't leverage it because there was no UI to select from it and the only way that you could do that was via this URL you gener with a query string so um I would suggest that you use pull request template MD and not use the folder uh and that's where it kind of feels like it's it's like uh where you have issue templates where they have that older version of it P requests still feel like that old kind of version if that makes sense so there you go GitHub discussions is a community communication tool for your public or private GitHub repos and there's a lot lot of features it has it has threaded conversations categorization Community interaction markdown support pin discussions conversation polls discussion voting convers uh conversion to issues notifications searchable uh searchable linkable GitHub integration and I'm certainly sure there is more um you have to turn this on as a feature in your repo a discussion tab will appear in your GitHub repo and you'll have some default categories to begin with so there you go so when someone creates a discussion in GitHub discussions they need to choose a category and there's a bunch that already exists for you by default um but you can create your own and it's a powerful feature to have so the idea is that you have these discussion formats and we have these four so we have open discussion this is just free form conversation you have Q&A where you're basically up voting the best answer think of stack Overflow you have announcements only admins can make these posts anyone can reply you have polls so you can uh pull people to see you know things uh categories can be grouped into sections and it's pretty straightforward from there okay specifically for the Q&A discussion format you can mark an answer that is the recommended answer regardless of the up boots to help direct which question you think is the most credible this is very similar to stack Overflow so the idea is that as a men or maybe a maintainer I can mark it as the answer and then it will show up as the answer the reason I'm calling this out because it could be an exam question so there you go we can pin discussions this is similar to issues um and the idea is uh you can just pin a discussion it shows up at the top of the page and it'll be nice and colorful you can pin for particular categories or for the whole discussions page but it's very straightforward okay for a discussion you can actually convert it into an issue I say convert with quotations because really what you're doing is creating a new issue it's weird they use the language convert in the documentation but clearly when you're adding it right there it's telling you it's just creating an issue it's just going to prepopulate it with the same content and then it's going to have a soft link it's not like Po request to issues or there's any relationship there it's just a simple link um and a convenient way to help you make uh an issue from a discussion okay hey this is Andrew Brown and in this follow along I want to take a look at discussions so we have our fund repo in our uh organization account I'm going to go to settings and let's go ahead and enable discussions so we'll go and do that I'm going to go ahead and set it up based on the default and it has a bunch of cool stuff I'm going to go ahead and hit start discussion and so now if we go over to our discussions we have our first discussion that we've ever posted we have some default categories you can see I can upvote or you know not upvote and then if I want to provide a marked answer I can just hit comment here um oh this one is just uploading it not necessarily has Q&A so let's go ahead and try some of the different discussion formats so I'll say new discussion and we'll say Q&A I'll say uh what is the best movie ever we'll start a discussion what is it and from there I'll just say Roadhouse okay and so people can uh mark it up or I can mark it as the a correct answer and that shows up like that we could turn this into an issue if we wanted to so I could well first I could pin this discussion and put it at the top so that's another thing so now it'll be at the top of our page here okay but the other thing that we can do is create this into an issue and now it's an issue there you go we can go back to our discussions um a few other things that we could do we could make a poll so that might be interesting choose the best movie what is the best movie what is the best movie we'll say Roadhouse or Roadhouse 2 Roadhouse 2 is not a good movie we'll go ahead and start that discussion and now we can vote there we go yeah um if you want to see a little bit more with uh like a full discussion uh GitHub as their own it's called discussion community and so you can see it's a lot more active a lot more fun stuff you can see that I made a post the other day here um about certifications that I was trying to provide provide them feedback they didn't hear me they ignored me but this is all about the certification that you are taking right now as I was trying to describe what I thought was lacking and what could be better um and if you're watching this video and you want to practice using GitHub discussions can you do me a favor and can you upvote this um because I feel like GitHub should really listen and it's a great opportunity for you to test the feature and then we can see how many people have been using this here so you can come over here and leave a comment and give it an up vote um but yeah that's about it for discussions and I'll see you in the next one okay ciao so I just want to quickly point out that you can find your notification options in your profile under notifications and you have some options there about what you are looking at for subscriptions what you're automatically watching or not watching go take a look there again I didn't see the examp am asking any of the stuff but you should really take a look here and see all the options here and we'll probably do that in one of the U uh the follow alongs here okay for notifications we have some filter options and uh we actually have a filter syntax it looks the same as every other filter syntax we've been looking at in GitHub so far there are some predefined save filters where you can see that they already have filter syntaxes underneath and if you want you can I think you can create your own yeah you can create your own new filters uh there is the option to group by repository or date again I don't remember the exam ever asking uh this but it's in the exam guide outline so I just wanted to quickly point this out okay so something you can do is you can mention people in um in comments and so what that will do is that will get their attention um and by that I mean it'll show up in your inbox uh for the f filters you can go to the mention and quickly find where you have been mentioned and yeah that's pretty much it it's just you mention people and it gets their attention and it'll show up in your notifications in box okay so the notifications inbox provides a chronological list of notification threads this allows you to keep on top of all subscribe activities with an Associated GitHub repo and that's located at/ notifications um and I want to point out that there is some other notification views I don't know if these are Legacy views or alternate views but I figured I should cover our bases and look at all of them most of the stuff that I think the exam is going to focus on is probably the inbox but I never got any questions about notifications whatsoever in my exam attempt but if you do um you know let's just make sure we cover our bases here okay hey this is angrew brown and in this video I want to want to take a look at the notifications inbox which is in the top right corner it looks like a little inbox you can also get there by probably going to Notifications somewhere I thought it would be here on the leand side or right hand side It Isn't So I guess you really do have to click that inbox to get there that's going to be up here at notifications um this is showing stuff that we're participating in so you'll notice that uh we have um what looks to be poll requests and I guess we can click into there and get to them right away so you can see that um you know somebody's talking to me here and so I'm getting those uh alerts there and this has to do with all participating stuff so there's not a lot to show here um but we can show mentioning because that's something that I think would be interesting to show so what I'm going to do is go over to my other account and I'm going to go into a repo that we're both in so I'm going to go to Andrew WC Brown um um and there should be a repo here no that's that's not it I'm part of some organization called Cloud journeyers already forgot what it's called so I have to get the URL from this one here and we'll switch over to cloud journe and I want the fun repo and I'm just going to grab that link go back to the other account and then from here I'll just go into an issue and I'm just going to say um I think so I'll say andrewc brown I think that would be Roadhouse okay maybe we can go get an image roadh house for fun movie Roadhouse movie there we go oh yeah that's a good that's a good one so I'm just going to drag that off screen here and bring that in here so we got another reason to use uploads for file images and I'll comment that and there we go so now what I'm going to do is go back to that other account and I'm going to go into my inbox and see if I was mentioned what the heck oh there it is okay we just had to be a little bit patient so there it is um we know we have some other options over here we have what's this I guess approve uh don't get any more alerts for it or save it for later or bookmark it um I guess you should know those options again I didn't see them in the exam in terms of other stuff I'm going to go to my other account to kind of show you a little bit more because it has more information in it but uh of course we can filter stuff so I can say is unread and then we can even click through and do more stuff like repo is exam Pro you know and then I can click there and it should filter for that we could Group by repository instead right so that makes a a little bit more clear pretty straightforward pretty straightforward um and that's about it okay C so you can watch a repo in order to get notified of activities uh your own repos are you're going to be set as watching and so you can change the level of participation that you want if it feels like we're repeating this we did because we covered watching prior we were talking about repos but what we didn't cover was the fact that there's this additional watching page where you can find where everything that you're watching this does not show up on the the notifications inbox so this is a page you're going to want to know in order to keep track of stuff that you're watching so there you go let's take a look at notification subscriptions and this allows you to follow activities for a specific PLL request or issue so if you go into an issue or you go into a PLL request they have that notifications area where you can say I'm subscribing and you can see all your subscriptions on your notifications page but more or less the notification inbox is going to take care of that um but what I want you to remember is that watching is for repos it's for people it's for organizations notification subscriptions are for very specific poll requests or issues okay so there you go hey this is angre brown and this fall along I want to take a look at those other screens the watches and the subscription so we can uh see that alternate View and the easiest way to get there is to go to the Inbox and I can scroll all the way down to the ground and we have the options down below and so if I click into watch repositories I can see all the repos I'm watching and I can see all the subscriptions I belong to and there's not a whole lot to say here this is kind of like an alternate view of um notifications inbox so it's not that super exciting but it is another simplified view we can go take a look at our notification settings and we didn't really look at this in the lecture slide so I should cover it a bit more here and carefully read it so we have the default notification email so if I want to send that to another email I can do that there's custom routing which allows you to send certain things uh to certain emails I've never played around with it before but it sounds cool we can a automatically watch repositories uh or teams so I imagine if we join a team we're match we're watching it if if we uh create a repo or own it we're watching it we can choose between email and GitHub okay um notification for conversations you're participating uh in so whether we get a mention if if we should get alerted uh apparently we can customize our email updates so basically what we're going to get in those emails then we can get a weekly digest or not get any emails whatsoever you can get notified about dependabot alerts um notified about GitHub actions and then a deploy key alert so when you're giving admin permissions and org when a new deploy key is add it so there is your settings and that wraps up notifications so gists provide a simple way to share code Snippets with others and every gist is a get repo which means that it can be forked and cloned you can get this at just. github.com this is a super useful service I use it all the time time and uh here's an example of a public gist gist can be public or secret public gists are searchable public gists show up in uh in Discovery or discover I should say secret gist are not searchable and do not show up in Discovery secret gists are not private they are secret but they're not private you can share yours with friends and because that URL could be given to somebody else they could get access to it secret gist can be changed to uh be Public public gist can not be changed to be private you can pin just to your profile for other others to easily find just allow other users to comment just allow you to navigate revisions with ease you need to remember these factoids because the exams will test you on it I got just questions and one was about like um about knowing how to fork or clone uh and also for the uh the private thing that just secrets are not actually private to create a gist very straightforward uh oh sorry I just want to point out that gists can be also marked down as well they don't necessarily have to be code and that's really nice but to create a gist is very straightforward you name it you provide the file name so knows how to do the syntax highlighting you provide your code you can attach a few files to it and create a gist I'm going to remind you that and maybe I didn't write it in there but gists are full repos okay so even though they're like single files they're full git repost uh and you can clone them and do a lot of fun stuff with them okay I was saying that you can fork and clone gists uh and the way you would do that is if you drop down the embed you'll see clone options I don't know why they kind of hide it on you but basically you just clone it like a regular repo um and for uh just repos other than yours you can just Fork them so those are two things you need to know because they'll probably show up in the exam and I just want to make sure I really call those out to you here okay hey this is Andrew Brown and in this follow along I want to take a look at gists so gists allow you to create simp it's a code that you can share with other folks so I'm going to go ahead and do just. github.com and I'm just going to zoom on out here and before we create anything I just want to show you that there isn't all gist page so we can see a bunch of stuff that's already here and maybe we can go take a test and just clone something at random so or not clone but Fork so if we go uh here we can just Fork this and now we can make changes uh to this here and so I'm going to go hit hit edit and I'm going just make some changes and hit update to this and what's cool is that you have this revisions Tab and it actually shows you what's been changed over time so that's something that I really like is that if you're trying to uh teach somebody something and you need to show that history over time just make for great examples um so I really like that again embed here you can go ahead and clone htps or SSH let's go over here and make a new gist I want to make a private one so I'm going to keep it or sorry not private but secret so I'm going to go ahead and say secret gist okay and we'll try to make this markdown so just say readme.md I'll say secret gist this is Secret okay and maybe what we'll do is we'll attach our file here I wonder if we can just drag it in yes we can and me I think it added okay oh maybe it's it's in there I'm not I'm not 100% sure but I dragged it in and we'll go ahead and create this secret gist contents can't be empty that's totally fine um I'm not exactly sure okay so you do that um I thought like you would drag it in maybe it's very particular in terms of what you can bring in again the exam's not going to test you on that but I'm a bit confused why I can't bring that image in but I'm going to go ahead and create this gist and it is secret if I want to share this with somebody um I would give them the sharable link so there it is new tab there we go right pretty straightforward uh you can pin these to your profiles I think we did that already um so if I go over to our and you can star just as well right so if you go here you can star just you go your star gists right but um if we go back to github.com I think we already have one pinned from before so if we go to our repositories or sorry not repositories our profile we can see we pinned one earlier so yeah there you go that's just a Wiki is a collaborative way to quickly create documentation and multiple nested pages and a Wiki would serve as a knowledge base for your repler or your organization wikis are not unique to GitHub but it's just a functionality that they have uh and so the idea is that you'd have this uh thing that looks like markdown could actually be something else in markdown and you can search it and navigate through pages um to turn on Wiki for a repo you have to check box on Wiki you go to the wiki tab you create your pages GitHub wikis can be used for free on public repos which is how we're going to be able to use them I said that uh it can be other types of markdown or sorry markup and markdown is the default but there's a bunch here because wikis have existed for a long time and so they've uh really had a lot of different kinds of uh templating languages to link other Pages you provide the GitHub Wiki Pages the title as the link um so that's a little bit different for link and that's one thing you need to know for visibility if you create a Wiki in a public repo the wiki is available to the public if you create a Wiki in a private repo only people with access to the repo can access the wiki so there you go hey this is Angie Brown and this follow along we're going to take a look at wikis and so I figured what we can do is go to our um organization and we'll go over into our fun repo and we'll turn that feature on by going to settings and Wiki apparently is already turned on I don't remember turning it on but hey it's on maybe it's on by default and we'll go ahead and create our first new page and this is our homepage so it's as simple as creating it and we want to create another page this one is going to be called about and I want to link this one to our homepage and so it'll be as simple as putting Square braces parentheses and we'll say homepage and I think the other one is called home page so as long as that is correct that should work um it doesn't look like it linked so maybe it's just called homes I'll try that again and we'll edit this page and we'll save it there we go and that links back there and so we can see they're both there there's some way to provide structure underneath I'm not sure if that just uses headings so I'm going to go ahead and try this and just say heading one heading two and you know wikis here are not that great um like I remember wikis all the way back in 2005 and yeah they it's providing that structure and you know they would allow you to basically just start writing links and when you click through they create them so definitely not a New Concept um this one's not that great but it is here and it is free so you can decide whether you want to use it most providers will have some kind of knowledge based thing and that is github's kind of offer but again I don't think a lot of companies like to use this and I've seen a lot of organizations start on here and then abandon it and just take it off of GitHub but uh it is a thing and they want us to cover it so there you go GitHub Pages allows you to directly host a static website via a GitHub repo you need to create your public repo with the repo name so uh this would be Omen king. github.io it has to github.io for this to work you simply add your HTML files however you could use jaal which is a static site generator that allows you to build more complex static sites and it it uses yaml files with front matter and markdown files and it directly integrates with GitHub Pages because it is a GitHub project um and your website will be available at the domain name with your username at GitHub do I wrote com it's supposed to beio so cross that out IO there you go hey this is Andrew Brown and this follow along I want to go ahead and create ourselves a static website so apparently what we can do is use our username and do github.io and that should allow us to turn this into a static website so what I'm going to do is go ahead initialize a read me and we'll make this a repo public and we'll see if it's as simple as they say it is I'm going to go ahead and add a new file here this one is going to be an index HTML file so we'll just go ahead and say index HTML and I need a little bit of code here so I'm just going to get a template for an in index HTML page maybe we get one from free Camp I'm going to go ahead and grab this one here I don't need any JavaScript so I'm just going to take that out there we'll give that a preview looks fine to me we'll go ahead and commit those changes commit those changes and so the question is is this a static website um I don't know let's go ahead and copy this maybe we have to turn it on nope but we can go try to figure it out by going over to here and so I'm carefully looking for that static website hosting I've done it before it's just been a while and yeah uh it's pages over here Pages ah here we go so build and deployment so deploy from a branch that's the classic experience I'm totally fine with that and I'll choose main okay what happened it used to just let you do static Pages let's go take a look here uhuh create the do that's what I did I followed the instructions on this page and if the repository doesn't match the name exactly it won't it won't work okay Okay uhhuh add an index page okay sure push and you're done well I did all that so I'm going to try this again oh okay it just needed some time to propagate but here looks like we can do a little bit more so if we were to integrate um jaal and deploy it and like integrate it we could deploy that Jackal is pretty cool um it's a little bit out of scope for this sort of the other thing that's interesting is you could add a custom domain GitHub doesn't seem to really care about GitHub Pages for the exam so um you know it's on here but I I didn't see any questions so this is why it's so so light that we're covering here but uh that's it okay let's take a look at GitHub actions which is a cicd pipeline directly integrated with GitHub repos and GitHub actions allows you to automate running test Suites building uh IM specifically Docker images compiling static sites deploying code to servers and more and we can access this all through the actions tab in your GitHub repo uh when you first use GitHub actions there are some templates that you can utilize and all these files are stored in your workflow directory in your GitHub folder as you can see there's this kind of yaml file that we're going to utilize it's going to be important that we remember some of the structure so I remember on the exam they wanted you to know that there was jobs on and steps uh you can have multiple workflows in a repo triggered by different events so when you run GitHub actions you'll get a history of workflow runs where it will indicate if it was successful or a failure how long it took to run so this is um for something probably for um some for one of the boot camps that we ran as we used GitHub actions to build the site if you want to find the example repos because there are those little getting started but it's the same repo here at the starter workflows and you can get the yaml files and get started really quickly there are different types of triggers uh that you can use with GitHub actions that's going to go on that on area and GitHub there's about 35 GitHub actions I say plus because in case there are more that I'm not aware of I'm covering my bases there examples of common GitHub actions could be pushes pull requests issues releases schedule events and manual triggers the exam wants you to know that you can trigger based on these things so make sure you remember this short little list here okay hey this is angrew brown and this follow let's take a look at GitHub actions so what I want to do is go over to our organization I'm going to go to our fund repo and here we have a tab called actions where we can set up some GitHub actions now I don't use GitHub actions a whole lot maybe I will if I go ahead and do that GitHub action cert uh certification course but uh we'll just have to kind of work our way through it it shouldn't be too hard so there's a lot of different things that we can utilize here I can set up terraform which is kind of cool uh we have deployment to AWS to Azure to Alibaba Cloud we have some security things that we can do here we have continuous integration automation a whole host of stuff and um you can even do static compilation which is pretty cool as well so we're going to have to make make a decision in terms of something that we want to use um um I don't think it's going to be deployment because that seems like a lot of work um so I'm trying to make a decision here what we could utilize build lint and test a rails application that seems pretty small or easy for me to do but maybe we should try to use one of these things down below um labels pull requests based on files change let's go ahead and see if we can utilize that so I hit the configure button and it's going to bring us into this action and I guess there's the marketplace where we can get uh more stuff I didn't even realize there was a Marketplace for this looks like we got some documentation here so customizing when workflow is run based on trigger so here it says on push Branch so when we push to specific ones we can trigger different stuff okay so that's kind of cool let's take a look here and see if we can expand this and see what we're looking at so we have name labeler on pull request Target jobs and then we have labels so run as Ubuntu so probably start a container as an Ubuntu with permissions of contents to read and it can write pull requests and the step that we're going to have here it's going to use the actions labeler version 4 and with the repo token it's going to bring in that token so it has authorization to do so and we know about GitHub tokens um and I think I think we showed this uh for GitHub actions but not 100% sure so care reading here the whole point of this is to apply labelers and the basically the way it's going to do that is through these steps and so I'm assuming that this is kind of like a builtin step and if we go here and just type it in maybe we'll go find it yeah and so they're talking about actions here hold on here I guess it's just a repo so I'm get documentation and oh okay it's called actions all right and so this whole repo contains actions all right and so it's coming from this one and so I'm just going to go into here and take a look at what this looks like so just zoom out for a second and it kind of explains maybe how it works um automatically labels new pull requests based on the paths of the files being changed on the branch the ability to apply labels based on names of branches and things like that the bug related to the issue so create a GitHub la. yaml file this will list a uh a list of labels and config options to match and apply the label all right the match object allows control over the matching options you can specify the label to be applied based on the files that have been changed and Etc like that and sounds a little bit complicated but at least down here it's like showing us uh the flow it's interesting that this one is showing version four when clearly there is a version five um there might have been warning up here saying that we should use it doesn't say that we have to use version five or four or we're first to use five um but let's see if we can figure this out so I'm going to go ahead and go down below and just look at the workflow a little bit more here and it looks pretty much the same the only difference is that this one's using version five it's not passing the width for the repo token so I'm not 100% sure if we actually really need to do that but I'm going to go ahead and go commit changes and we'll commit that there okay so now we have that here if we go to actions um we can see that we have labeler and it's only going to run what's going to trigger it let's go take a look here um if we want to know how it triggers we should just take a look at the code and whoops go back here and and take a quick look so it says pull pull request Target so we pull request Target what does that mean we'll go search it here um pull request Target so activity types assigned assigned labeled runs your workflow when activity on a poll request in the workflows repository occurs when activity on a pull request in the workflow activity Cur so it's going to check on based on a lot of stuff so that's pretty broad but that seems fine looks like we could even narrow it down to very specific types okay so I mean that's is how we could play with triggers um and so basically when that triggers it's going to go ahead and then start up Ubuntu for some reason maybe that's what it has to use to run this code that we saw from over here okay and this looks like it's JavaScript or something and then we need that labelers file so we need to make sense of what this is so the base match object is defined as this any glob to any file okay the key okay so what does this thing do automatically label new pull request based on the path of the files being changed on uh changed or the branch name okay well I'd rather just do that on the branch name so let's see if we can find that so it says change files give me a moment just to try to make sense of this and then I'll just save you the trouble of me struggling through it okay okay scrolling on down we're getting better examples this is starting to make more sense it says add an any change label to any changes within the entire repository Okay add documentation label to any changes within the docs folder so maybe what we can do is give this one a go and uh we need to create a file what's this file need to be called. GitHub labeler yaml so we'll go here and I'm going to add a new file okay um add a file this will be label l. yaml double check make sure that is correct I've been known to make mistakes often and I'm going to paste that on in here and we're going to commit that change so now we have our labeler yaml I'm going to go take a look here and see if the action got triggered it did um it failed I mean there's nothing for it to check right now so no event triggers defined is on so not exactly sure what it's saying there but that's totally fine for now and what I need to do is I need to create a poll request I mean it shouldn't trigger unless we have a poll request right um but it did just happen now so I'm curious what would happen if I went ahead and just uh made any kind of change because it shouldn't really trigger unless it's a pull request we'll go here and go back to actions and it ran again so I'm really confused why is this running what it should only happen on a pull request Target um we'll open it up again here so no event trigger defined is on okay maybe there's something wrong with our our workflow file let's see what they say you can trigger all branches just by using remove the hyphen your workflow file seems fine have you checked all indentation so I mean we didn't make that file right it was generated for us let's go take a look and see what we can do about that we have label and labeler okay so this was the one that we wrote I mean everything looks fine here I'm G to open this up in codes spaces or not codes spaces we'll open this up in bring this down on this line like this and do that um I don't know if we need this so I'm just going to take that out because the other one didn't have it okay can expand this yeah it still has this here and I'm not sure why this little red line is here maybe it's just superficial it's confused but this seems fine I'm going to go ahead and update this and say update action the other question is do I have this in the right folder because yeah it's an actions but labeler yaml labeler yaml isn't supposed to be in the actions folder so I think what's happening here is that it thinks I think I know what happened here um if we go back to our repo I think it thinks labeler is a an action yeah so I think it's just we put that in the wrong folder so I'm going to go back and open up github.com it and we will let that push and I'm going to go back over to here all right and if we go back over to actions oh uh this is not the repo we'll go back over to our organization into Fun repo it might have triggered one more time I don't know it has not so we are in good shape can we delete this run yep we can let's just delete this up to clean up so we can see what we're doing and uh what I want to do is I want to trigger that uh pull request to get automatically labeled so we're going to need a label called documentation for this to work so we're going to go here to labels and we'll make a new label there actually already is one called documentation I don't know this is case sensitive so I'm just going to change it to Capital D so it just works for us and we're going to go over here to code and I need a new Branch so I'm going to go to Dev and in here I'm going to create myself a um a docs directory so I'm going to make a new folder here and what I'll do is I'll make a new folder we'll call this docs and I'll say readme.md read me okay we'll save that we'll go ahead and Commit This and we're in a branch right yeah we're in a branch so commit we're like new docs Direct and I know I spelled that wrong it's okay nobody's watching here today there's no grading going on if I ever grade you I'll poke you for that but right now it doesn't matter and I think that we made that in the dev Branch so we'll go over here and I want to go ahead and create a new poll request so want to make sure that folder is there PLL requests new pull request we'll drop down Dev we'll compare that over we'll say create pull request and the idea is that when we create this it should label it if this worked as expected um and so what I want to do is go over to actions and see if it triggered and it's running so it's queued it's going to think what to do it has to spin up compute so this is an instantaneous in progress good we're watching it label complete success we'll go to our pull request there we go look at that um and now we have a p a check that passed and we overgo to our checks and it shows that it passes so you know before we talked about like Branch rules we could maybe just tell it that it has to pass that before it could proceed not a really good example for this but we could try it and it's just an opportunity to show off this Branch protection rule stuff so I'm just looking here carefully for where that was uh it was like checks okay and I'm going to drop that down and still doesn't show up here so maybe that doesn't work as expected but I was hoping that maybe I could just choose that from there um because it's not like an upfront check it's like something that happens after you do that but anyway that's get up actions in a nutshell um it is very important that we understand how those files work so before I go I just want to uh pull up a link because there was something that really explain explained the structure of these files really well it was understanding GitHub actions okay so it's this here learn GitHub actions understanding GitHub actions I think it was this one yeah and so this one really helps explain this workflow file so let's go through it really quickly and make sure we understand it so um first thing is the name so we're going to name it that's optional we have run name so the workflow uh runs the generated from the workflow I guess it's going to be like the Run name we have on so specify the trigger of this workflow so on triggers events jobs groups together all the jobs that run then we have steps groups together all the steps that run uh in the check bats version notice we didn't have these before runs on configures the run on the latest version of Ubuntu Linux Runner I imagine you could change this to other things uses uses keyword specifies the step that will run uh here and of course we found out those are remote repos so that makes sense um and that's pretty much it so so steps jobs on remember those three on jobs and steps okay and that's pretty much it so I'll see you in the next one okay ciao GitHub copilot is an AI developer tool that can be used with multiple idees via an extension so here is an example of it autocom completing code for a terminal base uh blackjack game which I asked it to do it can do code completion you can have uh chat conversations in your ID or mobile while you're working on code it is a CLI assistance it does code referencing public code filter and IP Indemnity I don't know what the last one is but it does it and you can get a free trial with um uh for a one day 30day trial do you need a credit card I'm not 100% sure but we're going to find out here shortly as we will go and to set it up it is free to use for verified students teachers and maintainers of popular open source projects all right so let's compare the two versions of uh GitHub copilot we have the individuals and the business version of copilot and the reason I'm doing this is because I'm pretty sure I got an exam question about a specific comparison so pay close attention so for pricing copilot for individuals is $10 a month or1 for the year for copilot business it's 19 uh USD dollars per user per month the types of GitHub accounts would be personal accounts for individuals and then or and Enterprise accounts for copilot business for Telemetry you get it for um individuals which I believe that was the exam question that I got asked for business you do not get it um for Block suggestions matching public code they both get it uh they get both plug uh plug rights into your editor so extensions for both Ides or for both of them for multiline function suggestions they both get them for organization wide policy management copilot business gets that uh excluding specific files copilot business gets that for audit logs copilot business gets that and then for HTTP proxy support via custom certificates copilot business gets that so make sure you know which you can get and which one cannot get those feature sets okay let's take a quick look on how we would set up copilot and some of its functionality so the first thing we will need to do is install the GitHub copile extension in vs code there are extensions for other different browsers but this is the one that we're going to focus on once you install it you want to trust the workspace and install um sign into GitHub for GitHub copilot you're going to authorize GitHub in order to allow access and then you'll have this little copilot icon in the bottom right corner when you want to start using it the first thing I would do is go look at the keyboard shortcuts they do list keyboard shortcuts on their website but I found that um uh the ones that were set for me were completely different I have no idea why so whether you're on Mac or Windows make sure that you know what your settings are at the time I was doing this I was doing this on my Mac and so it's showing Mac like key bindings here uh it's and again it's just a reminder best to check the hot keys because it can be changed to anything and they didn't seem to match for me um once you have copilot installed you can also enable copilot chat feature and this allows you to chat in the le hand side I found this to be extremely useful and I would recommend turning it on if you can but uh yeah there you go so in this fall along we're going to take a look at installing or setting up and using um GitHub copilot um I have a business version in my uh primary account and this one I'm going to try to set up IND ual um so hopefully that will go smoothly here um so the first thing we want to do is start using copilot and maybe a good idea would be to try to use it in um code spaces because I feel like that's going to be a lot easier and there' be direct integration before we do that I just want to show you something kind of funny about uh GitHub and their branding so they have really decided to call themselves an AI powered developer platform which to me is a little bit silly because they're only AI solution is copilot is there any other ey stuff not that I'm aware of um but it's a really weird rebranding because they are still a g hosting repository but hey they can do what they want to do but I'm just not going to buy it but anyway let's go ahead and open up code spaces and we do have some other ones down here below just going to delete them and we'll just start from scratch here um just delete and delete so we don't have to worry about these other ones here and what I'm going to do is go over to uh that repo one more time uh over here and we'll go ahead and create ourselves a new code space so we'll just give it a moment to spin up and we'll configure it as per usual all right so our environment or our code space is now running what I'm going to do is go ahead and change the color theme to dark or something that is easier on my eyes and what I'm looking for here is copilot now is it already preinstalled I have no idea we'll go ahead and take a look so we'll type in GitHub copilot and see if we can find it here and there it is so there's a couple things I'm going to want I'm going to want GitHub copilot and then we have GitHub copilot chat it looks like it grabbed both of them when I did that so I didn't have to do anything extra um so that is going to go ahead and install there and then down below it says extension failed no access to GitHub copilot you're currently logged in as Andrew Brown that's true and it says no access sign up so let's go sign up for GitHub copilot and here we have a few options we have the monthly $10 plan or the $100 plan where's my trial so it says pay frequency after trial so you have to pay for it um confirm your payment details and it looks like we'd actually have to fill in payment information so I'm going to save you money here today so that you don't have to spend anything and I'm just going to show you in my other account what it looks like to use uh GitHub cop pilot so you can pass the exam whether you want to fill the stuff in is up to you um I'm not going to do that I'm already paying for it so I'm not going to pay for it twice and uh you know again my expectation is you don't shouldn't have to pay pay for that either so what I'm going to do is go up to my C command pallet and just go into stop and I want to stop the current code space and I mean we figured that out that that's where we're going to hit that boundary I'm going to switch over to Omen King and I'm in the same repo and I think I'm part of this so I can open this up in code spaces and we'll go ahead and do the same process and I'll be back here in just a moment when this environment is ready to go all right so our environment is up and as per usual let's change our theme to something that is a little bit easier on the eyes so there we go and we'll proceed and do the same thing as we were doing before so I'm going to type in copilot and that's going to give us copilot right here I want the chat to be installed as well but it seems like it knows to pick that up there's also uh copilot copilot voice I've never used it it looks like it's in preview so that's kind of interesting but uh not something here for today that we'll be playing around with um and I'm waiting for this to finish its install and it should you know come up and pop up here if it doesn't I can click down here below and it looks like it's ready to go so I'm not having to do any additional configurations again this other account already has copilot activated but while I'm here what I want to do is show you in my settings the copilot options so if I go down here below you'll notice here that we have um this feature enabled so because it is a business organization I had to go into that one and turn it on but if it's enabled and I did enable it then I I think that's the reason why I picked it up because the first time I did this it didn't install that chat and then I had to go into the settings and say turn and enable chat and then now it seems to automatically install so um I think the chat's right over here so that's really good and then down below is we can click this to bring it open let's go take a look at what our keyboard shortcuts are because that's going to really tell us how to use this and so we have control forward slash so accept panel suggestion alt uh Square brace next or previous open completion panels contrl X suggest terminal commands uh inline trigger so we'll try our best to try to figure this stuff out there's clearly a lot more stuff going on here like explain this and other things like that so I mean explain this might be a really useful one to have or generate docs that seems pretty cool but what we'll do is go ahead and make ourselves a new file and pretend that we are programmers I a programmer but you know we're all pretending we're uh that's fine anyway I don't know where I'm going with that let's go ahead and make a game so I'm going to go ahead and type in game RB and here it says press to ask GitHub copilot to do something so let's go ahead and click that and ask it to generate some code I'll say um create a game Loop for a terminal uh tick tac toe game okay so I'll hit enter and there's a lot of different ways you can interact with it this is like one way you can do it in the chat copy and paste and do other things but it's starting to get this stuff set up uh and the thing is that this is actually pulling from real repos so it's not like magic it's actually going out and leveraging a lot of public repos which I'm not really happy about but um it does get the job done and so we already have a game generated out here does it start the game for us it looks like it does and so let's go ahead and see if we can play it so I'm going to go ahead and type in Ruby and type in game. RB and hit enter and boom we got a game so enter your move row and column so I'm going to say it doesn't tell me like whatever I'm going to say one and one so I guess that's Center and is this the second player now so zero and zero and then we have one and uh so one and one what happens there invalid move okay so zero and one and then I'm just trying to purposely lose here so two and two and then zero and three zero and two so there's a few things about this game that's not really good it doesn't tell us the grid numbers it doesn't have an AI to play against a simple AI um it doesn't tell us um few things there so maybe we can make some improvements uh we can go to the chat and and I think the chat is like aware of our code so it should be able to make some modifications but I really like the fact that we had that little box in place um so looking through this I want to look where the board is being rendered I know Ruby really well so this is really easy for me to read and I'm looking for puts where does it render the board where are you rendering up here display the board and so method to display the board game the board should show the coordinates on the uh uh of each cell sure why not and I'm not sure how we would tell it to do that if I select that say modify this code to code to show the coordinates for each cell all right and see what we can do all right and so we'll copy this function we'll paste it on back in here say allow and we'll try this again we'll see what we get and it's not exactly what I want uh no so say no I want the coordinates on the outside of the board that's board border I me say board there we go that looks like a little bit more of what I want so we'll go ahead and try that okay we'll stop this and so now that makes a lot more sense okay so now I can go 0 0 and I'm I'm less uh confused about which one it is um so that's really good the next thing is I don't want to be playing against myself I want to have some AI um you know how can I uh can you write a simple Tick Tac to AI for my game code and it's going to do that so it's making a separate function which actually is a good idea and so that's actually what I wanted I wanted an inputed an output this code assumes that you have a game over function um do we have that yeah we do let's go ahead and see if that works but where do we use this function this this code assumes that you have a game over method that checks if a player has won the game the AI move method first checks if the AI can win the next move if it can it makes the move if it can't it checks the player if there's no winning um so the question is where you know where do I call this function in my code I'm checking to see if it understands the context of it it's loading in game. RB so clearly he's using that file to figure it out so it's saying here you should call the AI move function in your game Loop um so here it's updated our game Loop um the loop starts up there's a loop here and then this here is all I move so this is our main game Loop I'm just going to bring this on down here so it's less confusing okay and it looks like it's Rewritten it so we have update board I don't have display board in here this code will make the AI play its turn whenever the AI is turned the AI move function will decide the best move and update the board where is the display board in this Loop is this Loop incomplete could we also put the loop I was complete incomplete because it doesn't look complete to me all right so now it's actually completed it kind of lied but that's fine and so we'll go ahead and just copy this I mean I knew what to do there but that's fine and look it took out the uh while loop so it clearly changed its code let's go ahead and see if that works now um so I'm going to go ahead and do that and another thing that I would like to know is could it indicate can you indicate who's turn well we'll just play the game and see what happens first so I'm going to say 0 0 it says wrong number of arguments for game over let's go take a look at that I think it was suggesting that game over might be a little bit different so this says board and player and so I'm going to put player in here for a second and I don't see player getting called here um what about the new game over function yeah so it's going to try to update that you passed player and there's ways of doing uh like co completion in line I just kind of forget but this is the way I kind of use it so every tools a little bit different I'm sure if I did a uh course on how to use these tools i' would be a lot more thorough about it but I think this is sufficient enough let's see if it takes that okay and we'll say Z 0 wrong number of arguments so you can see like how this can be a little bit finicky to get something working um you really do need to know what you're looking at it is definitely a very powerful tool um but as you can see you got to keep working through it uh here maybe we'll just do current player I think it's because we still still have one more check here okay 0 0 there we go now it's moving um we'll say one one okay blocked me 02 there we go we'll say one Zer and then one two or 21 sorry 21 and it messes up here at the end I'm not sure why but for the most part it almost worked this is line 121 so I can go to line 121 and it has an issue updating the board for some reason so and it's on 114 so I could jump to line 114 here and yeah so maybe it just doesn't really have a way of ending the game gracefully but hey it did code it so that's pretty impressive we didn't really use those hotkeys but again it depends if you're going to be chat driven or if you're going to use the console here we could take a look at some of those hot keys and just quickly try to use them okay so we'll go back into whoops into our edit settings and whoops hot Keys here there we go control for slash accept a panel suggestion suggest terminal command trigger inline suggestion alt back slash so we'll do alt backlash and see what it does nope it clearly is trying to do something down below I think it did something yeah so I think maybe it's like um code and see it is also trying to autocomplete things but function for scoreboard go here and it's thinking down below so if it didn't do that we could have probably hit the hot key but it's apparently doing it I'm going to hit tab to grab that so you can see it kind of helps as you're coding but you learn how to use it as you use it we're not building something big here and I think this is sufficient so we'll call this one done I'm going to go ahead and stop this workspace so open up the command pallet stop and I will see you in the next one okay ciao hey this is Angie Brown and we are taking a look at GitHub codespaces this is a cloud developer environment or also known as a CDE Integrated with your GitHub repo and the idea is that you have this thing called a codespace that's what they call their developer environment and a codespace runs Ubuntu Linux socer container on a virtual machine hosted and managed by GitHub so this is kind of a representation of how it works um I don't write it here but the idea is that when you launch up GitHub codes spaces it's actually cloning your GitHub um repository so you can start working with it right away uh and most Cloud developer environments do that so that's a pretty common pattern and it's going to clone that repo into a workspaces folder so you can interact with codespaces via multiple ways we have the SSH via SSH via the GitHub CLI you have code editors such as vs code browser the desk to Jet brains IDE um for the desktop you can just open that up in the browser mode by going to open and vs code desktop and it does give you a bit more flexibility than the browser because there could be extensions that only work uh locally and you know it's just you get a better experience there but I usually use everything in the browser because I don't like to do local development anymore I'm totally moved over to the cloud but uh for the get upsi commands we do have a lot there so that's a great way to programmatically work with your GitHub codes spaces uh when you create a new codes space you'll have to choose the repo the branch the region the machine type and that shows that all there that gives you a good idea of how you can configure uh your code space uh the regions you can choose from Is Us East US West Europe West uh southeast Asia and the australas and you know what I think when I first launched I don't know if it always shows me this options but if you need to choose these options you can make sure you get that stuff uh there is a capacity of your environment based on the virtual machine type so the more uh the larger it is the more expensive it is and they they go based on cores so you can see the larger the cores the more RAM and the more storage you're going to get that second value being the storage you can see all your code spaces across all your repos at github.com codespaces and the way you're going to start a codespace is if you drop down that code under the codes spaces tab you can go ahead and create it on a particular Branch that's usually what you want to do is say I want to launch this on Main Branch or Dev Branch you can obviously use the GitHub CLI to open up code spaces there is a limit of concurrent code spaces allowed to run if you hit that limit you may need to stop other code spaces first I don't know if this is the case but there might also be a hotkey within GitHub repo but we if I'll have to go double check that uh before we talk about it okay hey this is Andrew Brown and this fall along I want to take a look at some of the configuration options when we launch up our code spaces so I'm going to switch back to my um other account here and we'll go into the fun repo and what I want to do is open up this code Tab and normally what we would do is we'd launch a code space here but I really want to choose the options that I use to configure it with and so you can see we have some other things here we'll go config with options and this is where we're going to get the choice of choosing our Branch choosing our region choosing our machine type and so that is the way that we can do it notice that we're limited to two and four cores this is probably because we don't have a credit card attached and so it is very limited I'm curious to see what it is in my other account which could have some paid capabilities so I'm just going to quickly switch over to that and take a look there so let's say we went into the exam Pro repo because definitely we're paying on exam Pro for sure and let's just say I'm doing terraform beginner I'm going to go here and go to Cod spaces and say with options and see if we get more options and yeah look we do get more options so that definitely is a factor for the things that you're going to be able to see so that is pretty clear let's go back over uh to here and I want to again go back to this repo and and I mean we definitely do want to open one for code spaces but we're going to go ahead and delete this one I really just want to get to the repo itself and let's go take a look uh yeah here again and I mean I never looked at this before so I'm really curious uh what's under here for configure Dev container oh it just opens it up in Json so nothing super interesting but it's nice to see they have some documentation here as you're working on that file to help you configure it I could have probably used that later on so um I guess we'll take a look at that but really it's simple we'll just go ahead and say with options and we'll be very explicit about how we launch it main now pretty straightforward we'll go ahead and launch a code space and so all I really want to do is just show you the command pallet in here for code spaces as we've already used codes spaces a lot in this course but um you know just go here and show you some of the command poet options so if we go to the command pallet which was down below here we type in code spaces this is where we're going to get a lot of the actions actually I'm surprised I didn't make a slide on this but um you can see that we have a few different things so uh we can change our Mach machine type here we can manage our secrets from here we can rebuild our container if we change our Dev container file um you know we can stop our workspace so a lot of stuff here but I'm going to go ahead and stop our current workspace okay CU that's good enough for me for now and we'll go back over to GitHub let's take a look at what we have in our settings so we go here we go down to code spaces and so we can have our secrets here we can have settings sys which just turned on and it doesn't seem to ever work and we have some additional options so we have access and security this might be oh I guess it's no longer here we can choose the default Editor to launch in uh the idle time the host image whether we want to use beta or stable or manually set our region but it seems like it autod detects but yeah it's pretty straightforward but we'll look at these features as we uh go through this codes spaces section so there you go let's take a look at the GitHub codespaces life cycle there was no diagram so I'm the first one to make one uh if that's even that exciting but usually the first thing that's going to happen is you want to create your Cod space and technically reopening is kind of similar so we could say create or reopen and from there we want to get our codes space running once our codes space is running uh we can stop it and of course stopping it freezes the state of your workpace so you can use it again later and the idea is that if we wanted to reuse it we just reopen it and it'll run again if let's say our um code our environment timed out for any reason maybe we walked away from our computer computer maybe we just forgot that we forgot to turn it off maybe we had some kind of interruption uh code spaces is going to turn off by default after 30 minutes of activity um it's basically the same thing as doing a a stop and it's the equivalent um yeah it's the equivalent of doing a stop there so this is just to keep cost low for you um you know if you want to make changes to your Dev container file which is going to say what your base images and stuff that's installed you have to do a rebuild in the current environment that's the only way it's going to do do that if you're launching up a codes space for the first time it's going to build it from that Dev container but sometimes you have to do rebuilds uh the environment gets saved periodically so generally you not losing data so when you abruptly close and then it stops it's persisting data to the virtual machine as long as it's not deleted but still assume that that environment is uh possible to be lost I think after a certain amount of time it will actually delete um a repo after a certain amount of days so just understand that you know if it's something really important make sure to commit it and put it in a temporary Branch or working Branch um it does Autos saving so with the VSS code browser it will autosave on by default for vsod desktop Autos saave needs to be turned on apparently but when I was using it I never ran into any issues it just seem to work uh when you're deleting when you're done with your uh your environment you can delete it uh you don't have to delete it if you think you're going to start it up again because you're not uh having any spend while it's deleted but there could be some limit in terms of how many workspaces you have or code spaces so you might need to delete some but there you go so when you create a code space it's going to be assigned an autogenerated display name and so in this case it made shiny space chainsaw and sometimes when you have a lot of um code spaces it gets confusing what is the contents of those codes spaces so it's totally possible for you to rename uh your codes space and that's just going to make things a lot easier you can see all of those codes spaces at/ codespaces and it'll just make it a lot clearer okay hey this is Andrew Brown and this fall along we're going to take a look at how to rename a GitHub codespace so let's hope that we already have one here so that we can rename it if you don't you'll have to make a new one this one's called shiny Cod not a great name not a great a great name whatsoever but let's go ahead and rename it and I'm going to call this one uh just Dev okay and we'll keep it right nice and simple here and so now it's been renamed Dev and so let's go take a look at our code spaces so we can see the renaming of that so it's not here I got to go back a little bit and so now we can see all of our code spaces and there it is so we have our um our repo here and it's called Dev and that is a lot better than before so that's all I wanted to show you let's take a look at some vs code um configurations in the context of GitHub codes spaces so the idea is that GitHub codes spaces should persist your vs code settings so you get a similar environment across code spaces so far I haven't had that experience I have no way of figuring out how to configure that but it seems like it's supposed to to work so if you figure it out please tell me but I'll just pretend that it does work somehow um if you've never used vs code before there's this thing called settings and it's a little bit more complicated than that because all this stuff that you're editing in the UI is actually updating a settings. Json file um it gets synced and backed up I'm assuming on uh GitHub maybe it goes somewhere else you can see there's a backup and sync settings you can override settings Json options in your Dev container json. file let's take a look at vs code extensions so GitHub codes spaces should persist I use the word should because again I'm not getting it to work for me the idea is that you can install your extensions um most vs code Marketplace extensions are available to install in the vs code browser for GitHub code spaces you can ensure your extensions reliable load every time by setting them in the dev container. Json we have vs code theme this allows you to change the look of your vs code um and you know this is a personal choice of what you want to choose but those kind of choices you're not supposed to put in your Dev container. Json fall for some reason um but yeah there you go there are two options or configuration options you should know for GitHub code spaces and that's timeout and retention period um so timeout is how long code spaces should wait to stop a code space when there has been no activity you can set this to be as low as 5 minutes up to a maximum of 4 hours and the default is 30 minutes for default retention this is saying when should we start deleting your codes space if they are inactive you could set it to a minimum of zero days uh to a maximum of 30 days and the default is 30 so play around these values and figure out what works best for you so there is an option called sync settings for code spaces which will pull your sync settings and the idea is it's supposed to uh continually reset it so vs code sync settings lets you share your Visual Studio code configuration so such as settings key uh key bindings and assult extensions across your machines so you are always working with your favorite setup this has not worked so far for me I don't know what I'm doing wrong but um you know it is an option I have it turned on in my account but uh supposedly this is an offering uh that is available for code spaces you can configure GitHub code spaces to use dot files from a specific repo that will be used for all feature code spaces that you start so the idea is you checkbox this on you specify the repo it's going to pull the dot files from this repo into all future code spaces that you start up um GitHub clones your selected do file repos to the code space environment looks for one of the following files to set up your environment so we have install sh bootstrap setup sh and a bunch of others um so you can see that you could probably offset some of the configuration that would be in Dev container into this as post boot scripts um but yeah there you go codespace is deep link is just a way for you to generate out a URL that will launch a codespace for a specific repo so here is a look at the actual URL it says codesp spaces. new SL and then the repo name but you can get this deep link through dropping down the code Tab and then you can get either the URL or HTML or Mark up to make it really easy to launch it and when you do launch it it's going to bring you to the create a new codespace uh workspace you can checkbox the quick start if you want to skip that but that's all it really is it's just a sharable link so when you're using codes spaces you might have uh environment variables or uh passwords or Secrets or access tokens that you don't want to hardcode into your code because that's just a bad habit uh it's just going to lead into uh serious issues so you need to inject them some way in environment when they launch up from a secure location that is what Cod spaces Secrets does so you can see in this example we have eight of those credentials and the idea it will get get is that we'll get loaded in the environment so we'll go take a look at that okay hey this is angrew brown in this video I want to take a look at how to set secrets for code spaces so we'll go to the repo there might be a few different ways that we can set it what I want to do is go first check if we can do it this this way no but uh we can go over to our settings and we'll check out code spaces here on the left hand side and from here if we scroll well it's actually right up here we can create a new secret and so let's just pretend that we have a super secret we'll just make up something here and we'll just say Roadhouse uh a bunch of numbers and then a dollar sign and a net sign okay and we can even say what repo it's for so it's for the fun repo we're going to go ahead and add that secret now let's go launch up uh a code spaces and see if it's available so I'm going to go back to that repo and yeah we'll go back over here we might already have one from before I'm going to go ahead and delete that and I'm just going to launch a new one so that we are squeaky clean and I'm not sure why it's giving me all these options I just want to launch one we'll go back over here we'll try this again we'll say create one on Main and we'll hope that that gets loaded in so I'll be back here when this is fully loaded okay all right so now that our environment's up I'm going to assume that those secets were loaded via the environment variables so I'm just going to bump up the font here for a moment we're not going to spend too much time in here and I'm going to type in andv and actually we'll just hit enter and see what we get so we have a bunch environment variables that doesn't help so much so I'm going to go back and type in GP and we'll type in super and there it is so we can now access that as an environment variable I could code out if I want super secret and there we go so that's all I really wanted to show you uh and I'll see you in the next one okay so before I do that I'll just stop this environment and yeah we'll see you now ciao so visual studio code Dev containers allows you to configure your Docker containers via Json file so you can use this in code spaces you can use this with vs code in general so the dev container Json file is expected in the root of your project and there's an example of a very simple one let's go look at some common configuration so you can quickly understand how this file Works um usually you want to provide a remote image so this is the one um that is I think being used for a base image for Microsoft and a lot of the um features that you can add to it uh you can build your own images by supplying the docker file in your project and Supply it some arguments uh there are features that allow you to quickly install certain programs we did this earlier um I think in our uh quick and dirty um git crash course but the idea is that we can install these features so we can get quickly moving uh and this is specifically for the common base image if you want to create your own features you totally could but it has to be for your uh image you can also uh configure custom programs you usually put that in your Docker file um you could also use the post crate command to run a um shell script so there's a lot of ways to um do Post configuration or try to do something very similar and as I said you can create your own features to quickly install on top of your own base images it is a lot of work to make features though um setting settings allow you to configure the settings of vs code so that is a block that you can put in there and you can see we also have one for extension so it knows what to install next time we can tell what ports to always forward which is really useful if you're running web servers we have command Flags uh uh at or we can pass command Flags to R uh Docker run with the run args so that's something that might be useful for you if you need to pass environment variables you set that in the container EnV uh you can mount uh a bunch of locations and then map the the files and folders so we'll take a quick look here at some of the options so we bind mount a local directory Mount a Docker volume for persistent storage Mount the docker socket mount a specific file mount a host directory as a read only okay um the command that runs after creation is the post create command you can set the default username that a vs code should use when connecting to the container you can uh you could use the post create command to install a bunch of programs on top of your base uh container and that's pretty much it so there is obviously a lot that goes in with these Dev containers I find them really hard to configure I don't want to spend too much time doing them uh and the exam's not going to ask you about um uh this stuff but for practic practicality we should know it because if we're working with code spaces or vs code it's definitely something you're going to come across but there you go let's take a look at how you would change the shell for um GitHub codes spaces so the idea is that uh vs the vs code browser comes with bash fish zsh so you do have a few options in order to change your shells I usually just use bash but um you know maybe you like something else is there some way to get power shell on there probably but I didn't look into it and the way you configure that is in your Dev container so the idea is that uh let's say you wanted to bring in one called uh cssh and so you would specify the path of where it is so this is CS CSH but you know you might have to be very specific where it is and then that way you can uh uh have it in your profile profiles as a drop down um notice that if you are using um vs code for very specific OS distributions then you can set the default uh there um but yeah that's about it the github.com in github.io page the other way is by assembling the URL so you have github.io followed by it github.com so it's very limited in what it can do so there's two things that look like editors in GitHub and it's important important that we distinguish between the two because on the exam they'll definitely ask you the differences between them so for GitHub it is totally free for code spaces you have a free monthly quota but uh it can charge based on storage or core hours per month and this is usually based on that machine type it'll increase the cost for availability they're available to both on github.com uh for startup it instantly launches there's no Dev container Json configuration for code spaces it takes a few minutes and it does load a Dev container Json on for compute there is no attached compute you can't run code or apps for code spaces you have a dedicated attach VM you run and debug your code and your apps uh there's no terminal access for G github.com source is source code made freely available for possible modification and redistribution and you might have heard of some of these open source projects like Linux or git or Docker or spark um a lot of times these companies are really well utilized by a very specific company that will have a paid solution and it really does help keep um the project going or help with its mass adoption in the case of git uh git is actually um managed by the Linux foundation so it's not necessarily a project that GitHub manages but GitHub clearly makes a large um makes good use of git so open source uh benefits include things as encouraging Global collaboration speeds up Innovation offers adaptability and customization reduces software costs enhances learning for developers typically high quality and uh things that are typically high quality and reliable provides transparency for trust and security and open source software has often have free community versions which make make it easy for personal developers or small organizations to quickly adopt technology uh if you're looking at that logo that's from The OSI or the open source initiative which is a nonprofit organization they are the steward of the open source definition this is a set of rules that help Define open source software and uh one cool project that they have is they maintain a list of Open Source licensing documents and that way you're able to take these documents and quickly apply them to your projects the top five most popular open source licenses are MIT uh the new Public public or the the new general public license so GPL Apache 2.0 uh lesser general public license so lgpl and the BSD license depending on the license it determines whether someone can re redistribute your code uh as a commercial product or do they have to alert you of how they're utilizing the product or reference you there's all different kinds of licenses and you can pick one which works for your codebase if you choose to make it open source GitHub sponsors allows GitHub users to collect donations from their GitHub hosted open source projects so here you can see someone can sponsor the octocat so I say projects but of course you can directly do user accounts if it's through patreon um sponsorship payments um are facilitated two way payments through GitHub on github.com payments through patreon on github.com and so you can set it up for a specific repo to get your sponsor button um you can connect your patreon via your account settings I think to get that Global one there uh to receive sponsorship through GitHub on github.com you need to be accepted into the GitHub sponsors program I think this is specifically for if you want GitHub to collect the money on your behalf um you have to apply for it and go onto a waiting list you can do it for personal accounts and organization and you might have to provide uh well you will have to provide banking information in order to get paid GitHub makes it easy to locate people who maintain your dependency so you can support open source contributions you can go to fors sponsors exlore and it'll tell you about uh the like the repos that or sorry the dependencies that you're using your project to suggest um who you could sponsor uh that are helping you out uh in that sense but there you go let's talk about GitHub and open source projects um there is some kind of statement that GitHub makes about open source but I really couldn't figure out what it is that they wanted me to put in this course uh when I took the exam they definitely had some kind of um uh PR kind of language and saying what do you think that uh is github's relationship with open source so just do your best to Guess that I really couldn't assemble it here here so it's hidden in some kind of PR content but let's talk about the practicalities of how GI GitHub works with open source uh one thing is that when you create a repo you can choose a license very easily I imagine that it's from that OSI approved list and then when you go to repo you can see the license clearly displayed um and that will be stored in that license.md that could be license.md license or license.md with all caps they'll all work if you're looking to find open source projects you can use the search to search based on license um there are many open source GitHub repos that are hosted on GitHub um because GitHub offers a lot of stuff for free to uh good open source projects some people will mirror their project so maybe they don't host it primarily on GitHub it they'll make a copy and they'll sync it so that it has redundancy of where it could be you can use um uh you can explore under GitHub topics and GitHub trending in the community Pages uh to try to find open source uh projects based on whether they're popular or for specific categories you can follow organizations and um you can sponsor organizations and so that might be one way of doing that if you're utilizing the GitHub Marketplace they have a bunch of apps in here and a lot of these are open source projects and you'll have uh you'll be able to install them for free so that is uh something else that is really interesting um but yeah there you go hey this is Andrew Brown let's go take a look and figure out what kind of Open Source stuff we can find out on github.com and one thing I think that would be really important to check out is the Community page um so I think it's just here on the Explorer so on the left hand side we'll go to explore we might as well open up the marketplace as well I mean the marketplace is good also for apps um not just for open source but there definitely is open store uh stuff here so like if I go into here I'm not sure if they have an open source license but sometimes you go to plans and they might tell you this one says free not necessarily open source but there are ones that are open source that we can uh find but you do have to do a bit of digging to find them I suppose anyway um if we go to explore this is where we get a kind of a community of information uh you can see what's trending in terms of repos and developers uh we have topics over here where you can drill down into specific things so if you like AWS you can see all of uh these here okay so that makes it pretty clear in terms of discoverability for trending we could look for trending stuff as well over here all right but you know primarily if you're going to find open source stuff I guess you'd have to search for it and look based on the license so we can go here and trying to expand our search but maybe we say license license I have a hard time spelling that and so we can just choose one here say MIT and just hit enter ENT and it'll show us everything that is uh under MIT license so that could be one way that you could explore and try to find things um but yeah hopefully that gives you kind of an idea uh of you know open source maybe we should take a look and see what GitHub thinks they they they want to say about open source GitHub open source they probably have some kind of statement where open source Community lives a PR person definitely wrote this um open source software is free for you to use an explore all right read our open source guides and yeah maybe there's something in here that they would want us to know in the course but it's just a lot of stuff you know what I mean it's nobody wants to read through all this but um yeah I mean there's stuff in here so that's cool I guess but yeah that's open source and GitHub okay inner source is organization and development best practices for nonopen Source or proprietary software the term was coined by Tim orali back in 2000 an inner source is not a strict guideline but a loose strategy to establish an open source like culture within organizations it was really really hard really hard to figure out what this was because they they when they say loose they mean it's really loose um but uh what I found to help make more sense was to look at the free resources provided by the inner Source commons. org where they have a bunch of patterns that you can use um to apply to your organization to start to apply inner Source um and yeah it's just to make sure you adopt open source in a way that is great for the community and your company all right let's make sure we understand the difference between inner Source versus open source so the scope is a bit different inner sources is within an organ organization remember that word inner so if it's pointing inwards we're talking about the org if it's open source this is public and a global Community um in terms of accessibility in source is limited to company employees where open source is open to everybody for um purpose intersource improves collaboration efficiency internally whereas open source shares and collaborates on projects globally for contributions employees of the organization is for inner source and for open source it's about anybody such as developers or users for visibility in sources code discussions often private to the organization and open source publicly available and visible for governance in sources is based on the internal policies and culture of the organization and for open source it's usly governed by open source licenses and Community rules so there you go so forking a repo allows you to create a copy of a repo and uh for working allows you to take an open source or Source available repo and Go Your Own Way quickly apply bugs and patch fixes a separate repo to work on for Community contributions you can also uh create cross repo repo poll requests to get accepted into the original repo when you Fork a repo you'll be able to tell because it will say forked from the location underneath if you need to explore other Fork repos you can use the network graph to find uh specific commits to see the difference between your repo and another one is at a glance you may prefer using a forked repo over the original you may find uh the original project abandoned and a fork becoming the goto repo for a project Forks help keep public projects alive uh on the edge and collaborative so there you go geta repos can be set as public making repos easily searchable on GitHub via search engines public repos serve a community purpose for knowledge sharing educational resources and open source projects besides just search GitHub curates content via community Pages such as the explore page and the trending page um GitHub provides a robust search not uh that lets us not only search the repo's name but the contents of the repo as you can see in the advanced search we have a lot of options for search uh there is a search syntax where we can utilize a lot of different um of these little filters to find things very quickly the search syntax also supports regular Expressions wild cards not or and multiple terms and more so there you go hey this is Andrew Brown and this follow along I want to take a look at repository search as it probably will appear on your exam to know how to utilize this so what we'll do is just type in rails and um I'm looking for all results I'm going to click the one up here because I want to get to this more advanced search where we have a bunch of options and where the exam might ask is understanding how to compose a query so you can see we have a lot of options uh here and notice as soon as I click it starts filling them in so um if we just go here for a moment we can just take out rails completely and we could try to do something so we have public oh sorry we'll go down here and try it down here so we say public so is public is something that we could do um we could also specify based on topic I'm not sure what we would put in for topic let's go take a look and and see what is there so I'm not really seeing anything for topic but what we could do we're not exactly sure on all these parameters if we go to advance search down below this kind of basically gives us the same stuff so if I was to search topic here I'm really surprised I can't find what topic is but let's go take a look and see if that actually is something because I'm really curious GitHub repo topic um with topics you can explore repos okay so it looks like we can actually categorize them in certain ways I don't even know that let's go over here ah yes topics here okay so I guess the idea is that we can classify our project based on a topic and so maybe one could be Azure so we could go back over to our search I was kind of curious about that and we say something like topic colon and then Azure and then hit enter and so this could narrow it down to Azure projects maybe we can take out the rails term in the front so we can kind of narrow down exactly what it is we're looking for so now we're getting kind of azure projects we can put like loose search on the end here so let's say we wanted to use bicep which is something that Azure has we could search it that way I'm kind of curious about this topic option because I didn't realize we could set topics so let's go over to our repo and see if we can set that so I'm going to go into our fund repo we'll go into settings and I'm looking for topics so let's find that and the reason I'm interested is because on my exam actually topics came up and I wasn't really aware of being able to set them so yeah let's go see if there's some way we can do that um searching topics on the about page it seems like we can set that so I'm going to go back to my repo here and we'll go here oh we have topics so I could say fun which is not a real topic but we could do that we could say uh beginner and so that's going to provide U topics that are uh really well known and allow people to search for that so I think that's pretty useful so you know get some experience with the discoverable uh or the the search functionality and add some topics and I think that'll be good enough okay GitHub labels are used to categorize issues pull requests and discussions and the way it works is you can just apply multiple labels to your targeted item and then it should show up beside the item somewhere uh you can manage your labels or create new labels on the labels page for your repo and creating a label is pretty simple it just needs a name a description and a color the GitHub CI provides commands for labels so it is very easy to create labels Milestones allow you to group multiple issues into an end goal which shows completion towards that goal for each closed issue so the idea is you can make a new milestone you can assign Milestones to it I'm just going to my pen tool out here so you can see but the idea is that as we uh close we get to a completion so if we have one open one Clos we're at 50% and when we're done it's at 100% you can set a date um and there you go hey it's Andrew Brown and this fall along we want to create some custom labels it's pretty straightforward but uh I figured we should take a look at a more popular repo and see what kind of labels they're using if they've even modified them at all so we're over here on the rbon rails um uh site and you can see we have lots of labels and they're breaking it Down based on uh sub packages and things like that and I'm not sure what this is it looks like maybe open issues you can go here and filter out to that um there's a lot of automation that you can apply with labels um so when you create issues you can have labels being preassigned you could have uh pull requests act a certain way based on the labels it has so there's a lot you can do with labels we're not going to show you all those automation features but we will show you how to create your own labels which is pretty straightforward so we'll go into our fund repo and we'll go over to issues and we will create some labels we'll make a new one here called um secret if we haven't already made one before and I'll go ahead and just choose a random color and boom we have our secret label if we go over to our issues we can then go ahead and ass sign all sorts of labels super easy so y there you go that's all you need to know ciao hey everyone it's angrew brown and this fall along we're going to take a look at Milestones so what we'll do is go to our fun repo and we'll have to create a couple of issues I have one here called what is the best movie ever but then we can say what is the best food ever as our other ticket and then we can figure out what that is later on but the idea is that we want to put this into a new Milestone so what we'll do is go back to issues and we'll create ourselves a new Milestone and we'll call this um liveing life I don't I don't know what to call this but we're going to go ahead and call that um oh that was another issue that wasn't a milestone but that's fine we could always use more Milestones here and we'll create a new Milestone we'll say true living okay and we could set a date in the future and date that we want to complete this and I'm going to go back over to my issues and I'm going to checkbox well first all go into one and we can assign the Milestone this way we can also Mass assign probably this way as well if we go here by the way there's Mass assignment for all these things for issues probably good to know that and now if we go over to our Milestone we have a percentage of how complete it is so if we go back over here we can close a couple of these okay and if we go back over to our Milestone we can see that we've made some progress It's 66% complete I want to show you maybe rails because I have a feeling that they probably have Milestones a lot of Open Source projects will have Milestones to help you know when the next version's coming out so if we go over to issues here and go to Milestones you can get an idea like when the next version is and that's a really great use case for Milestone so we can go in here and see that they only have one more ticket to get version 7.13 out um then we have 8.00 and they have a bunch of other stuff so it is quite interesting how Milestones can be organized but usually this is the use case uh that I see but anyway we'll see you in the next one okay ciao G up projects is a planning and tracking tool when working on G UB repos and a project has an adaptable view that can be changed at any time between a spreadsheet a taskboard and a road map um so that's kind of the screen where you choose what kind of view you want projects directly integrate with issues and poll requests projects have built in workflows to automate common actions so uh the idea is that a GitHub project is composed of multiple views and you can add more views to your project each views layout can be changed at any time to accommodate the project use case so if you set set up a view you can change it whenever you want uh so let's take a look at what the table looks like so this is a great uh layout if you want a traditional uh ticket tracking system or you have a large amount of tasks then we have the board this is a great layout for agile task and if you need to understand clue the state of your issues it's your basically can band board and then we have road map this is great if you're trying to plan for uh uh tasks based on a timeline we call these normally um Gant charts so that's kind of what that is there for your layout you can configure your data based on multiple options so we got Fields columns Group by sort by field sum slice by zoom level and dates I'm not reading through all this because I didn't see it on the exam so uh you know these are pretty straightforward and you can read these if you want but um yeah so your GitHub project items have custom Fields you can create new fields and add uh and provide options to easily fill in those those fields and I mean that's pretty much the start of it but there we go let's talk about GitHub projects versus GitHub project classic as this might end up as an exam question and to avoid any confusion if you somehow end up creating a classic project so GitHub projects are new more Dynamic interfaces with tables board and Views uh classic just has a can band board style thing like Trello um GitHub projects are highly customizable different views and Fields the classic is limited customization options uh there is apparently more automation support in the new projects whereas the old one was simpler the new projects has enhanced reporting features and insights whereas classic has basic reporting and tracking uh GitHub projects has deeper integration with GitHub issues and poll requests whereas Classics has basic integration with GitHub repos GitHub projects offers more advanced and flexible project management tools compared to GitHub classic projects which is simpler and more straightforward there's no reason to ever use class unless it's for legacy reason but yeah there you go GitHub has builtin project workflows that allows you to automate what happens based on specific events in your projects so you have this workflows um area like I think you do the ellipses and you get to workflows and from there you can uh basically change some Behavior so when here it says when a pull request is merg you could say set the value or the status as being being done for this particular field there are the following builtin workflows item added to project item reopened item closed code changes requested code review approved pull request merged Auto archived items Auto add to project and for the exam they will definitely definitely ask you which are some builtin workflows I do not like that question but it's in the exam so make sure you remember the so that you can get an extra point on your exam uh for more advanced automation of GitHub projects you can use GitHub actions and there you go project insights lets you create charts about your GitHub projects and there are two charts that they want you to know the first is current charts and the second one is historical charts so current charts is basically you take a value and you can plot it as a chart the historical charts is you take values and you plot them over time the exam will definitely ask you about what are the two types of um charts so make sure remember that it's current charts and historical charts there you go hey this is Andrew Brown and in this follow I want to take a look at uh GitHub projects and by the way I'm not sure if it's picking up but I'm in my snowsuit because it's so darn cold in my office because it's winter and my furnace isn't working so if you hear like scratchy sounds it's because I'm wearing a fullblown uh heavyduty snowsuit okay and you might hear them in other videos but I just wanted to point that out if that you know if you're wondering what that sound is but anyway let's go take a look at our fun repo and from here I want to make our way over to projects and we'll create ourselves a new project I would like this to get out of the way and um I'm going to go ahead and create a new project I should note that um a project can um contain uh tasks and issues from other projects but for the most part I I'd rather make a new one here and so it's just keeps giving me this darn pop get out of the way and so we can choose from a bunch of different templates um I'm going to choose Team Planning because that sounds really good and right away we're going to get a bunch of views across the top so we got our backlog we can go ahead and add an item I'll just say uh watch Roadhouse and write a a review okay and so we'll go ahead and do that and this is a draft so it's not really an issue yet it's kind of like in limbo but you can convert this to an issue and put it in the repo and now I can drag it around and move into other states which is really nice we can go up here to backlog if we don't like the board we can change it to a table this allows us to drop things down in a very nice and easy way it gives us some uh default parameters that came with this project we can go to road map if we want to and we could say need to do it between this time and that time for the scope of our project not super complicated I don't know how this stuff works I fiddled with it it wasn't doing what I thought it was going to do but I'll change this back to a board um we could go and generate at a chart which is going to be in Project insights understand there's two types of charts current charts and historical charts and this one looks like it's a current one so it's not over time and how you would have it in time I have no idea um oh up here so I guess these are the types of layouts we can have so that's pretty cool um so we change that to line or bar or sacked bar uh we can go ahead and hit new chart and I'm trying to figure out how do we get historical charts because I thought it'd be like you choose one or the other but doesn't seem like it's that way it seems like you probably have to group it by something or you'd have to have it based on the timeline like iter or something so yeah I'm not exactly sure how you create the historical chart I don't think it really matters um again this is GitHub foundations we just need to get some familiarity with projects if we go up here in the top right corner um we can get this drop down to get over to our workflows and again I'm going to go through these with you so we have item added to project item reopened item closed you can see there's a couple already sets so when we have an item closed it's going to set the value as done okay so if I go back over to this issue okay and we close it it should get moved to done there we go so see how that automatically moved to done and that's because of that workflow here and so we have some other ones that we could set up if we want we could edit them but these are very very simple as you can see they're very straightforward uh we can go to settings and in settings you can see we have our custom Fields you can add them change the field type to a very specific comp so if you want to say I want to collect the date you could have that there and we call this Roadhouse date which makes no sense but we can do that we go back to our settings we can go to our ticket okay and click it and we can now set our Roadhouse date so yeah hopefully that makes sense but it's pretty darn straightforward and that is GitHub projects when commenting on issues or pull requests you can add a save reply that you already have set up previously and so if you go to the save replies icon uh you can then go choose run and this is a great way to have like canned responses um I'm sure there are benefits for this it's pretty obvious it saves your time but uh yeah that is a functionality that you can do uh there for uh replying to comments okay I just want to explicitly point out that you can assign issues and poll requests to specific users right uh you can filter issues and PRS based on assignes and I just wanted to make that call out because in the exam guide they wanted to call it out and I figured I should make a simple slide there so there you go so securing your account using 2fa uh normally it's called MFA but for whatever reason they're just calling it 2fa cuz it is really only two Factor authentication this is where you use a secondary device such as a phone to enter a code in as a extra security precaution when sign in or performing sensitive actions and so you can choose your preferred UFA method on GitHub which could be between GitHub Mobile SMS text message or the authenticator app um we have all these options for twofactor authentication so you can use authenticator app like aie which we did use in uh when setting up our account a lot earlier you have Google Authenticator Microsoft authenticator I'm sure there's other ones we could use text messaging we could use a security key like a UB key which is a physical piece of Hardware we can use GitHub mobile which we absolutely do we can have recovery codes which is something that is just a backup in case you get totally locked out of your account and you need to enter those codes in but there you go personal accounts has two permission levels the first is the reposit to owner owner repository owner I can say it the person who owns the account that would be you and the repositories owned by personal accounts have one owner the ownership can uh permissions cannot be shared with another personal account for collaborators these are people you add as collaborators I cannot tell you how many times I did this slide that's the best I can do it so we'll just live with the way I said that um so let's go through the type of permission that repository actions have they can invite collaborators they can change the visibility of repos limit interactions with repos rename the branch including the default Branch they can merge a pull request on a protected Branch even if there are no approving reviews they can delete the repo they can manage the repo topics they can manage security and Analysis settings for the repo they uh they can enable the dependency graph for a private repo delete and restore packages customize the repo social media preview create a template from the repo control access to dependabot alerts dismiss dependent bot alerts in the repo manage data use for a private repo Define code owners for the repo archive the repo create security advisories display a sponsor button allow or disallow Auto merge for poll requests yes there's a lot of things here I realize this is tiring manage deploy Keys manage web hooks let's take a look at what collaborators can do Fork the repo rename a branch other than the default Branch create and edit delete on commits pull request issues in the repo create assign close and reopen issues in the repo manage labels for issues and pull requests in the repo manage milestones for issues and pull requests in the repo mark an issue or pull request in the repo as a duplicate create and merge close pull requests in the repo enable disable auto merge for a pull request apply suggested changes to pull requests in the repo create a poll request from a fork of the repo submit a review of a poll request that affects the merab ility of the poll request create an edit a Wiki for the repo create an edit releases for the repo ask as a code owner for the repo publish view or installs packages removes themselves as collaborators on the repo okay so that's a lot to remember so just remember this repo owners have full control of the repo collaborators can pull such as read the contents of the repo and push right changes of the repo there you go ciao Enterprise managed users also known as emus allow you to manage the life cycle and authentication of users on github.com from an external identity management system or IDP GitHub partners with some Developers of identity management systems to provide a pay path integration with emus U the idps yeah idps mostly provide authentication using saml they can use Microsoft entra ID previously known as azuread and also offers oidc for authentication the IDP applications Provisions users with systems for cross doain identity management s cim and I'm going to just tell you on my exam I got so many darn questions about this and I have no idea why but anyway for partner idps you can use Microsoft entra ID formally known as azuread okta and pig Federate they all support samle uh only oid is supported by Microsoft entra ID and then you have SIM now when I say I got questions of the exam it wasn't specifically which partner provided what IDP but it was more just understanding that enterprises have this functionality of of having SCM and O oidc and was it between Enterprise uh server and Enterprise Cloud okay um there we go hey this is Andrew Brown and this fall along I want to focus a little bit on security as I feel that uh the security section here is a little bit light and maybe by looking at some of the security stuff it might help us on the exam because they do asking about like these scanning things and so I'm hoping that if we look at them you'll remember them so we have dependabot code scanning and secret scanning this is a public repo so we have these options here and uh we have private vulnerability reporting let's see if we can turn that on what happens it's a beta feature let's turn it on can we turn it on it's on there we go can we turn on dependabot alerts let's do it it is on and then we have code scanning so code scanning is a little bit more work it has code ql anal analysis is it easy to set up let's do the default and it says we're using Ruby and we'll enable code ql so all those scans are now set up it was as simple as that I don't think it's going to cost me anything additional because it's a public repo okay and so now those are enabled I thought this one was enabled because we turned it on but maybe not secret scanning would be something that would be really good so let's go ahead and try that out secret scanning let's enable that as well and boom there you go you got all that stuff in place it's no more complicated than that we do also see secrets and uh variables here so it looks like it kind of uh bring brings them all into one place so we sought for code spaces but I guess GitHub actions can have secrets as well dependabot can have secrets as well looks like the same kind of functionality across the board for all of these we were basically just looking at code security analysis so you know that's that we can go over to our settings over here maybe they have a security tab over here uh um yeah they got this it looks like the same thing more or less maybe from a Global Perspective it says push protection for yourself block commits that contains uh supported Secrets across all repos that sounds really good I'm going to turn that on but uh yeah just remember those three things the secret scanning uh did I say three things let's go back and make sure it's just those three whatever they were we'll go back here dependabot code scanning and secret scanning remember those three scanners okay hey this is Andrew Brown and this follow I want to take a look at what kind of permissions we have for organizational accounts I was trying to make a slide on this but I was getting um M mix match information maybe because there used to be an old way of doing it now there's a new way and so it was really confusing so this doesn't really work but I figured what we could do is just look at the organization and see what we have for options it didn't mess me up on the exam but I still think that we should take a look and see how um those kind of permissions work uh for uh organizations so here I'm in an organization we have collaborators and teams and notice that we can set different roles so we have admin maintain write triage and read and if we want to have custom roles we would have to have GitHub Enterprise that's the only way that we're going to get it so hopefully that is pretty darn clear I don't know what else to say about it it's pretty darn straightforward um but uh there could be a bit more but I don't know so I just wanted to show you that very quickly okay so within a GitHub repo we can manage multiple features by enabling or disabling them such as wikis issues sponsorships preserve uh the repo which goes into the GitHub Arctic code Vault discussions projects and possibly more I just got to point this out because it's in uh the section for GitHub and administrator and so uh for the GitHub foundations course and so I had to explicitly call out these particular features and there we go let's take a look at repo permission levels and so when you're a collaborator and they accept an invite you can choose from predefined roles with different levels of access the first is read which allows you to view and clone the repo open and comment on issues and pull requests and download releases we have triage which manages issues pull requests without WR access label and assign issues and P requests close and reopen issues emplo requests we have maintain this allows you to push the repo manage issues pull request labels and project boards create and publish re releases configure repo settings for nonsensitive fields we have admins which basically have full control and Enterprises allow for custom rules okay Branch protection rules are used to enforce certain workflows or requirements before changes can be merged into a branch you can find that under the uh Branch tab in your GitHub repo and so here we could apply a banch uh Branch protection rules there's a lot of stuff that we can do here we can require a poll request before merging require status checks to pass before merging require conversation uh resolution before merging require sign commits required linear history required deployment to succeed before merging lock branch do not allow bypassing the above settings and for admins we can allow Force push allow deletions on the exam they might ask you what kind of uh Branch protection rule you can do I don't think it's a very fair question because I can never remember all of these but unfortunately it might show up in your exam and if you don't want to lose a point make sure you remember generally what things you can do with Branch protection rules okay so there is a security Tab and this is for your repo and it basically acts as a security check list if you are um not the owner you're going to see something else like the actual security policy and some information about vulnerabilities in the repo but security policy is one thing that it will suggest uh for you to create which is a markdown fall on how security vulnerability should be reported we have security advisories which privately discusses fix and publishes information I think they're deprecating this feature um except for open source public repo so it might not be something that uh is used uh much in the future uh we have private vulnerability reporting allow your community to privately report potential security vulnerabilities to maintainers and repos basically a form to tell you about vulnerabilities I think this is in beta right now uh we have dependabot alerts so a bot that alerts you of vulnerabilities due to outofdate dependencies dependabot can automatically create PRS to update dependencies for you to approve we have code scanning alerts automatically detect common vulnerabilities and coding errors via code ql and third party tools and then we have secret scanning Alerts get notified when a a secret is pushed to a repo collaborators allow uh you to let other GitHub users have access to your repo based on the permission levels you provide so you can search based on username across everybody it'll tell you whether they I actually I don't know if it'll tell you if they're external but the point is you can search for them and then you can add them the idea is that you'll get an invitation you have to accept the invitation um at the invitation address I strong recommend that you tell people um to go accept it because it's not the best at alerting uh other people and then sometimes it just times out or expires so that's kind of a pain so just make sure you keep on top of your invitations okay an organization can group uh organization members into teams and so that's an example of having a core team um you can set the VIS visibility between uh secret and visible that will definitely be an exam question that I got so make sure you remember that teams can be assigned to projects and issues uh uh request reviews from teams or request reviews from teams yep teams can be mentioned in discussions issues and pull requests control team access to repos and new members can be added to teams instantly giving them access to all relevant repos and discussions so the idea is that if you add people to a team you have uh ways of delegating out a bunch of um responsibilities and things like that so there you go GitHub connect enhances GitHub Enterprise servers by allowing your ghes instance to access some of the github.com cloudon offerings so the idea is that because you are selfhosting there's just functionality that lives in the cloud and so this is their way of bringing some of it to you what kind of functionality are we talking about well that is the automatic user license sync dependabot github.com actions which I'm not sure what that means but oh probably GitHub actions it's cuz the Dooms in there it's confusing server statistics unified search and unified contribution so the key thing I want to remember is that GitHub connect is specifically for the Enterprise server Edition and it's to uh bring certain features uh to your selfhosted version from the cloud okay so GitHub Enterprise Cloud accounts have a third special GitHub repo which is called internal and so what this internal GitHub repo does it allows all Enterprise members to have read permissions in the internal repo internal repositories are not visible to people outside of the Enterprise including outside collaborators on organization repos unless uh your Enterprise uses emus members of the Enterprise can Fork any internal repos owned by an organization in the Enterprise and internal repos are the default setting for all new repositories created in an organiz organization owned by an Enterprise account so all I want you to know is that there is these things called internal repos they're only for Enterprise Cloud are they on the server one I don't think so but in the docs they said it was for cloud and then when I looked up a different feature in Enterprise it said it was only for cloud but was for both so um yeah I would just say remember that there's just third option for Enterprise or Enterprise cloud and you'll be in good shape and get another point on your exam okay so GitHub makes extra security features available to customers under a GitHub Advanced security license and these GitHub Advanced security is available for Enterprise accounts on GitHub Enterprise Cloud GI GitHub Enterprise servers and some of the features are available for public repositories on GitHub I'm not sure I have of four in there I guess it's just a little muck up there so that doesn't make a whole lot of sense I can barely get to my pen tool um but anyway uh the features that they're talking about is code scanning secret scanning dependency review and So based on uh whether you're a public repo or you're a private repo without advanced security you're going to have different access so for public repos you get full access for private repos without the advanced security license you get nothing and if you have the advanced security you get them all what's confusing about uh this one in particular is um it says some of the features for public repost so it makes me think there's more than three features I could not find more other than the three listed uh maybe if I made an Enterprise account and contacted support that I could figure that out but um that is a lot of work especially for a foundation's course so just know that there is a GitHub GitHub Advance security license and remember those three components and those are the same things that we basically kind of saw in the um in the uh uh the security tab right with all the scans and dependency review I'm going to assume is dependabot okay uh but there you go let's quickly talk about saml and Sim these are both available for GitHub Enterprise cloud and GitHub Enterprise server um just remember that these are features specifically to Enterprise and just have a general understanding the difference between the to so saml stands for security assertion marketable language it is an open standard for exchanging authentication authorization between an identity provider and a service provider it's an important use case for saml is single sign on Via the browser if you don't know what single sign on is it's where you use one account to log in and then you're logged in everywhere else and so if you want to have single sign on the mechanism they're using here is saml then you have SIM so this is stands for system of cross domain identity management it's an open standard for automating the exchange of user identity information across different identity management systems a key use for SCM is to enable scalable and automated user provisioning and deprovisioning often integrated with Enterprise identity Services I know that's a mouthful but I got a simpler summary for you here samle is about securely transmitting user authentication and authorization data for single signon purposes and Sim is about managing user identities across different systems to simplify account maintenance provisioning so if you remember those two at the bottom you'll know what they are um they didn't really ask at least I didn't get any questions that had to distinguish between the two it was more so you know where are these features available and it was for both the Enterprise cloud and Enterprise server um and one other thing I want to just note is that these two uh these two things can complement each other in the same ecosystem because they're doing two different things um serving two different purposes so just understand that they Co comingle um and this is for Enterprises okay hey this is Angie Brown and this follow along I want to show you how to register um or book your uh GitHub certification exam so what you're going to want to do is go to the GitHub certifications page and you can do that by typing in G.I certifications and it should bring you uh generally here I've never done this booking before so we're going to learn together but it should wouldn't be too hard and the first thing we'll want to do is register I want to point out that if we go down below we can see our certifications and get additional information but I'm going to go ahead and register here and I actually already have registered and the process is connecting your GitHub account um to here so my steps might be slightly different but more or less it's the same so you might have a page where it's going to pop up it's going to show you that you have to confirm um a connection and go ahead and do that and you should end up in here and so so here is where we're going to see um uh our exams and so we have GitHub actions GitHub administrator advaned security and Foundations I'm interested in the foundations one so I'm going to go ahead and click into that and just understand that this price may change based on um you know based on uh if they change the price down the road but right now it's price is 99 USD because there this exam is so new at the time I'm shooting this video it actually has a discount of $49 so you might not get that um it might just be $999 USD which is still very affordable but just understand that uh you know different times means different results let's go ahead and schedule this exam it's through PSI so if you've ever done the PSI exam that'll be pretty straightforward so we'll go ahead and schedule and take our exam and we have information to fill out so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through all of this and fill up my information and click this button and then I'll show you the next steps I just don't want to expose of the information so I'll see you back here in just a moment okay all right so I click through there and and now it's going to want me to um accept the uh PSI test taker site to my GitHub account I'm going to go ahead and authorize this I'm just going to stop and start again just because I'm not sure if it's going to show personal information I don't really feel like uh um admitting it so I'm just trying to do that so I'll be back here in just a moment I'm going to head go ahead and click that green button there we go and it's brought us over to the PSI online store so this is a familiar experience at least for me let's go take a look at and see the uh available tests um you know sometimes there are tests that are online or are on site these days everything is both uh right right now I cannot take these ones I'm not exactly sure as to why as I'm pretty sure the other ones did not have prerequisites but maybe GitHub changed it and you need to have the foundations before you take these ones that's totally fine I'm just click into this and see why that is the test requires author from the test sponsor so maybe since it's so new at this time it's not going to allow me to do this or it could be that it is a prerequisite there but what we'll do is go back here and click on the foundations and notice that we have 99 USD I'm going to go ahead and continue booking actually going to click back there because I think there was a deal you're preapproved uh you're eligible for this exam until 31224 not exactly sure why I chose that message that's totally fine so we have online proctored and on site I'm going to go ahead and go to continue booking um we have some information here uh please don't call me it doesn't go to me uh just annoying okay so do not call my phone number we'll go ahead and hit continue I might even go WR that out so it's less of an issue for me I'm going to go ahead and type in Canada I am in Toronto time so going go ahead and type in Toronto that's uh Us East uh standard um and we'll go ahead and hit find and so now I'm looking for an available time that I wish to book um so I mean I could book it today that seems a bit crazy um do I want to do that am I crazy enough to do that today um maybe yeah you know what I think I'm going to do it I'm going to book my um uh mine tonight for 900 p.m. I know that sounds really crazy but I'm going to do it we'll go ahead and choose 900 p.m. make sure your time is correct you're going to have an issue there I'm going to book this time slot and now I need to fill in my additional information I just happen to have a velure code here I'm just understand that you know you may or may not have it but I just happen to have it because I'm lucky we're going to go ahead and fill in the arrest of information continue on if the review information has personal information I might not show it um but uh we're almost there so I'll be back in just a moment I just want to quickly show that you have two options credit card and PayPal so I'm going to go ahead and enter my credit card in I'm just going to go ahead and do that I'll see you back in a moment all right so yeah here is my confirmation I'm going to go ahead and purchase this so it looks to be good make sure you confirm the time and make note of the time that you have to complete it as that is very important um again to today is February 1st where I am so that is the correct date I'm going to go ahead and click purchase and now my uh booking is confirmed it's probably a great idea to print your confirmation a lot of times you have to prep your environment so make sure you uh set up your remote online Proctor uh system and do your checks prior to this so if you click that it should install an app on your computer um really make sure you do that ahead of time with these exams you should always have two pieces of government IDs so think passport and driver's license the reason I just tell you to have both of them is in case one is giving you a problem um so just make sure you have both on hand you really only need one but if you go to an inperson uh place they might want to have two pieces of government ID maybe one that's uh you know sometimes it can be health card but mostly it's driver's license passport um it's going to vary per country but uh yeah uh give me good luck on my exam and I'll talk to you soon out
