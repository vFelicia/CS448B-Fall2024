00:08 - hello everyone and welcome to this
00:10 - tutorial on tableau for data science
00:13 - we're going to cover a few basic
00:16 - features of tableau and how
00:18 - i use it for data science and how it can
00:20 - kind of fit into your workflow
00:23 - here's an example of a data science
00:25 - workflow
00:26 - we have
00:28 - in this example six different components
00:30 - and this is going to be different you
00:31 - know depending on what type of
00:32 - environment you're working in but
00:34 - generally you're going to have
00:35 - the data collection data exploration
00:39 - through the data wrangling
00:41 - data munching stage where you have to
00:42 - pull everything together and clean it
00:44 - for modeling
00:45 - and then the next step would be
00:47 - modeling
00:48 - validation and then reporting
00:51 - so
00:52 - the way i use tableau primarily is
00:57 - in the exploration phase and then in the
00:59 - reporting phase so expiration i want to
01:02 - basically be able to look at the data
01:04 - once i collect it i want to be able to
01:06 - look
01:07 - at the different variables that exist i
01:09 - want to see
01:10 - you know how the data is
01:13 - um
01:15 - distributed for example for each
01:16 - variable i want to see if there's any
01:18 - outliers or anything like that that i
01:20 - want to kick out
01:21 - from
01:23 - the uh the modeling because you know if
01:25 - you feed bad data into this model
01:27 - you're going to get some
01:29 - you know your garbage in garbage out so
01:32 - being able to explore the data
01:34 - i find is is really helpful
01:37 - and sometimes that's really all you need
01:39 - to know if you should move forward or
01:40 - not you know if
01:42 - you're trying to look to see if there's
01:44 - some kind of a relationship between
01:47 - variables
01:48 - sometimes a quick exploration and
01:50 - tableau a nice visual will help give you
01:52 - that and then also in the reporting side
01:56 - so once you've built your model
01:58 - you validated it and you want to be able
01:59 - to share your results with others
02:02 - tableau is also you know ideal for that
02:04 - they have great reporting tools
02:07 - it doesn't matter really what kind of
02:09 - organization you're in you you can pass
02:11 - you know if you have tableau server or
02:14 - or not you can you can pass your
02:16 - workbooks on to others so that they can
02:18 - view them as
02:20 - well so what is tableau
02:24 - so we kind of covered it briefly in the
02:25 - last slide but it's just a business
02:27 - intelligence slash data visualization
02:30 - tool that allows you to make sense of
02:31 - your data
02:32 - really by by looking at it
02:34 - right i mean
02:36 - sometimes we're we're looking at
02:37 - millions of rows of data you could check
02:39 - maybe the first hundred or
02:41 - you know first few thousand and look at
02:43 - the data but that's really not efficient
02:45 - and it's really not
02:47 - it's really not feasible these days to
02:50 - be able to
02:51 - just look at the data and figure out
02:53 - what's going on with big data and
02:54 - there's millions tens of millions of
02:56 - rows billions of rows potentially
02:59 - and being able to throw this stuff
03:00 - quickly into
03:02 - a tool like tableau and look at it
03:04 - really really helps a lot
03:06 - so here you have tableau desktop and
03:08 - then the server version so that we're
03:10 - going to be using the desktop version
03:11 - today specifically
03:13 - tableau public which is free you can
03:15 - download it for free from their website
03:18 - and that's just the software that you
03:19 - download to your computer and then the
03:21 - server version actually
03:23 - is within the browser you can create
03:26 - charts and dashboards and then upload
03:28 - that to the server for consumption
03:31 - throughout your organization
03:36 - so
03:37 - the interface here for tableau desktop
03:38 - is is really just drag and drop it
03:40 - reminds me of a pivot table in excel so
03:44 - you drag you know the columns and rows
03:45 - around to get what you want
03:47 - and and the way that this works is these
03:49 - are the fields here
03:51 - um and it's broken down into dimensions
03:54 - and measures so a dimension i think of a
03:56 - dimension as basically a category or a
03:59 - categorical variable
04:01 - and then a measure is a numerical value
04:04 - so it could be the number of records it
04:06 - could be any number of things
04:10 - and then here you have
04:12 - a filter you can apply a filter here
04:14 - and i'll show you how to use this
04:15 - section later the filter in the mark
04:17 - section
04:18 - but moving over here here's where you
04:20 - placed your columns and rows
04:22 - so if i want to basically
04:25 - show in column form i want to be able to
04:27 - let's just say pull in current status
04:29 - here
04:30 - to the columns and then number of
04:31 - records to the row then it would give me
04:33 - the current status categories along the
04:36 - x-axis and then the volumes
04:40 - for that category along the y-axis here
04:44 - so we're going to go over this
04:46 - with the live demo here but just want to
04:48 - give you a brief introduction to the
04:49 - interface
04:51 - and and how it's set up
04:54 - and this is the end result you know once
04:57 - you're able to make a few charts you
04:59 - could pull it together and make a
05:00 - dashboard like this for example
05:05 - so now we're going to go ahead and
05:07 - download tableau public i've just
05:09 - googled tableau public here
05:14 - and you're gonna have to put in your
05:15 - your email address here to
05:18 - download the app
05:27 - go ahead and put mine in there
05:30 - and download it
05:37 - may take a while
05:41 - depending on your internet speed
05:43 - but it's generally pretty quick
05:54 - so go ahead and install that on your
05:55 - computer
06:11 - i'm going to fast forward the video here
06:12 - so that
06:14 - you don't have to watch this entire
06:15 - install but feel free to
06:18 - pause the video and
06:20 - hit play again when you're
06:22 - ready to go
06:28 - okay so now i've downloaded tableau
06:30 - public
06:31 - i have
06:32 - the shortcut here was installed on my
06:34 - desktop
06:38 - and here we needed to connect to a file
06:40 - so it gives you several options here
06:42 - excel text json access pdf spatial or
06:45 - statistical file
06:48 - and the difference between the tableau
06:50 - public version and the tableau desktop
06:51 - which is the paid version it's about 850
06:53 - dollars is that you're you're limited to
06:57 - just a handful of inputs here
06:59 - hand just a handful of file types um the
07:02 - desktop version really has has more
07:04 - options here and you can you know you
07:06 - can connect to a server like
07:08 - um
07:09 - azure or
07:11 - any sort of cloud environment so aws
07:13 - azure or google cloud and pull your data
07:16 - in directly from there here
07:19 - so we need to go ahead and get our data
07:20 - set and the data set i'm going to use
07:23 - for this tutorial
07:27 - is the titanic data set from kaggle
07:32 - and i'll include links to tableau public
07:34 - and this data set
07:36 - in the
07:37 - video description you'll just click on
07:39 - that
07:40 - and you'll probably have to
07:42 - sign up if you don't have a kaggle
07:44 - account
07:45 - already and basically what this is is
07:48 - kaggle is is essentially just
07:50 - sort of the online olympics for data
07:52 - nerds
07:53 - you you have competitions for machine
07:55 - learning deep learning models
07:58 - companies can actually
07:59 - post their
08:01 - their data sets on
08:02 - kaggle and have
08:05 - basically the best data scientists in
08:07 - the world compete
08:09 - to build the best model and the winner
08:11 - can actually earn money so it's pretty
08:13 - cool
08:13 - so we're gonna go ahead and i've already
08:15 - got an account so i'm gonna sign in here
08:19 - and once you're logged in you can go to
08:21 - the data tab here and then we're gonna
08:23 - actually use train dot csv
08:27 - let's go ahead and download that
08:31 - i'm just going to go ahead and move that
08:32 - to
08:34 - my desktop
08:42 - and now we're going to connect to that
08:44 - csv file so it looks like an excel file
08:46 - but it's really a flat csv file
08:49 - test one
08:51 - so we're going to use text file input
08:52 - here navigate to the desktop pull that
08:56 - in
09:00 - and
09:01 - once you open tableau public and import
09:03 - your data set it's basically just going
09:05 - to show you
09:06 - all of the data fields that exist
09:10 - and you may not know what those what
09:12 - those are so passenger id survived
09:15 - passenger class name example for example
09:19 - so kaggle actually has a data dictionary
09:22 - here
09:23 - on the data set page
09:26 - so survival is a categorical variable
09:29 - one standing for yes two meaning know
09:31 - that they didn't survive
09:33 - passenger class is the ticket class so
09:35 - first second third class
09:37 - sex is the gender male or female age in
09:40 - years number of siblings
09:42 - parents children above the titanic for
09:45 - the following variables and then ticket
09:47 - picket number
09:48 - fair cabin number so the cabin number
09:51 - could be
09:52 - indicative of where they were located on
09:54 - the ship
09:55 - and then embarked as their report of
09:57 - embarkation
09:59 - so just just looking at this data
10:00 - dictionary you can kind of get a feel
10:02 - for
10:03 - which variables might be useful and
10:05 - which variables may not be useful at all
10:07 - so survival obviously is is very
10:09 - important we want to look at the
10:11 - correlation between these variables
10:13 - these other variables and whether or not
10:16 - the passenger survived
10:19 - so now we're going to go back to tableau
10:22 - passenger id that's going to be probably
10:25 - not very useful survive that's going to
10:26 - be very important
10:28 - passenger class
10:30 - passenger name is not going to be very
10:31 - important
10:35 - the ticket number is unlikely to be
10:37 - significant
10:39 - fair that's how much they paid cabin
10:41 - number
10:42 - and embarked so you can see we have all
10:44 - these columns here and you can always
10:45 - reference the data dictionary
10:47 - so we're going to go ahead and click on
10:49 - sheet 1 at the bottom
10:54 - and you can look how tableau
10:56 - automatically pulls in these different
11:01 - variables so they
11:03 - it makes a determination based on
11:05 - the type of data being pulled in whether
11:07 - it should be a dimension or a measure
11:09 - so in this class i'm sorry in this
11:11 - example we're going to
11:13 - really just want to look at
11:15 - the number of records
11:17 - and
11:19 - how the number of records relate to
11:21 - these different categories and whether
11:22 - the passenger survives we're going to
11:24 - actually go ahead and make all of these
11:25 - a dimension
11:28 - so for age to become a dimension
11:31 - we may put that into different bins
11:35 - so if i want to do that automatically
11:36 - for example if i want to choose an age
11:41 - let me range ahead and give an example
11:42 - here
11:46 - if i want to show this going down
11:50 - you can see here that it's it's just a
11:52 - measure here so it's adding up all the
11:54 - ages but what i really want to see is
11:56 - you know is there sort of
11:58 - a correlation between the age and
12:00 - whether or not the person survives so we
12:02 - actually want to create a measure
12:04 - based on this age measure
12:08 - create a dimension i'm sorry based on
12:09 - this age measure
12:12 - and we can do that automatically by
12:13 - creating bins so we can call it age bin
12:16 - and the size of the bin is basically the
12:18 - number of years between
12:20 - each bucket
12:22 - we'll just do 10 years
12:27 - and if we pull that in there
12:30 - you see we have a null value we'll go
12:32 - ahead and
12:33 - pull in the number of records and then
12:34 - circle back to that null
12:36 - so here we go now we have a distribution
12:38 - of all passengers
12:41 - on the
12:42 - titanic we're going to go ahead and pull
12:44 - out the null here it's very important to
12:46 - note that when i pull this over
12:48 - i'm not just clicking on it and pulling
12:50 - it over i'm hitting on a pc control on a
12:54 - mac you would use the command button and
12:56 - then left click at the same time
12:59 - and pulling this field over to the
13:01 - filters bar
13:03 - and if i uncheck the null value there
13:06 - apply and then okay
13:09 - that gives me the distribution without
13:11 - the null values
13:13 - so this is great but
13:15 - you know i want to have some context
13:17 - here by adding percentages
13:21 - so if i take number of records here
13:23 - again and pull it up to the rows bar
13:27 - and then
13:28 - hit this down arrow here and
13:32 - you basically have this drop down and
13:33 - then quick table calculation
13:35 - and then percent of total
13:38 - okay
13:39 - so now what that did is add we have the
13:41 - volumes here above and then the percent
13:43 - of total below
13:45 - but i really don't have any labels so i
13:46 - need to add the labels here so this
13:48 - makes sense
13:50 - in the marks bar
13:52 - this basically allows you to change the
13:54 - coloring the labels the size of your
13:56 - chart
13:57 - and you have three
13:59 - in this example you have three sections
14:01 - you have
14:02 - all
14:06 - the section which is the summation of
14:09 - all the records
14:11 - and then this bottom one represents the
14:13 - basically the percent of total
14:16 - so for the second one we want to go
14:18 - ahead and pull in the labels
14:21 - here
14:22 - to add the labels the column labels to
14:24 - each each bar
14:26 - so i'm going to hit control on my pc
14:28 - command on a mac and then left click
14:31 - hold those together and then drag it
14:33 - over to the labels
14:35 - box
14:36 - and you can see that it adds the labels
14:38 - there
14:39 - we're going to do the same thing now but
14:41 - for the bottom section
14:44 - and the percent of total
14:46 - control left click hold and then move it
14:49 - down to the label section you can see
14:52 - now on top we have the volumes and then
14:54 - the percentage of the total number of
14:56 - records below
14:59 - so this is great but what it really
15:00 - doesn't give us is whether
15:04 - you know we want to know if age was an
15:06 - influencing
15:08 - variable on whether or not the passenger
15:10 - survived so
15:13 - we're going to use the survived variable
15:15 - here and it's a measure
15:18 - tabloid treated that as a measure when
15:20 - it pulled it in
15:22 - to the data set but
15:24 - we really want to treat that as a
15:25 - categorical variable so we want to
15:26 - convert it from a measure to a dimension
15:29 - and the way you do that is you hover
15:30 - over the
15:31 - the variable
15:33 - and click down here and then convert to
15:35 - dimension
15:36 - so now that's a dimension it moves up to
15:38 - from measures up to the to the dimension
15:41 - section
15:43 - and we want to color
15:45 - these bars based on
15:48 - whether the passenger survives or not
15:50 - so i'm going to hold down control
15:53 - and then left click on my pc command
15:56 - left click on the mac
15:59 - in order to drag this field over
16:01 - but i want to do i want to apply that
16:03 - color to both sections so i'm going to
16:05 - click on the all marks box here and then
16:09 - click on it
16:10 - control left click hold and then
16:14 - drag that over to color
16:17 - and then you can see this legend pops up
16:19 - over here on the right
16:20 - and what that represents is if it's
16:22 - orange then
16:24 - that represents a survivor
16:27 - the survivor portion of the population
16:29 - and blue is the non-survivor population
16:33 - so you can see what the distribution
16:34 - looks like here in terms of
16:37 - the total number of records by age bin
16:39 - and then you can compare
16:41 - you know each
16:43 - ratio the percentage
16:46 - each age bucket to see if that age
16:48 - grouping had a disproportionate survival
16:50 - rate relative to
16:52 - all the passengers
16:56 - so this is great we're going to call
16:57 - this
16:58 - i'm going to rename this tab so i just
17:00 - double clicked here on the sheet and
17:02 - we'll call it age
17:04 - okay
17:06 - and now the good part is that we've
17:07 - already built this out so we don't have
17:09 - to redo this for every variable so i'm
17:11 - going to right click here
17:13 - and then duplicate
17:16 - and so what i'm going to do now is just
17:18 - swap out age for another variable
17:23 - so in this case we're going to use
17:24 - passenger class
17:27 - so i want to get rid of age bin
17:30 - so what i did to get rid of that is i
17:32 - just clicked on it left clicked no
17:34 - control or command button just
17:36 - and then just
17:38 - dragged it below and that got
17:40 - you know that removed it from the filter
17:42 - and i can do the same thing here just
17:43 - drag it away
17:45 - and here we're just stuck with you know
17:47 - left with
17:48 - these
17:49 - the summations of each
17:53 - each category here
17:55 - so now i want to add passenger class
17:58 - this
17:58 - also was treated as a measure so we want
18:00 - to convert that to a dimension
18:06 - drag that over
18:10 - we only have three classes here i can
18:12 - drag
18:13 - this over this chart to expand it
18:16 - so that it makes more sense
18:20 - we do not have any null values here
18:21 - which is great
18:23 - and you can see that it automatically
18:24 - populates
18:26 - everything so that's that's great we can
18:28 - change the name here to
18:32 - p class to represent passenger class
18:40 - duplicate that
18:48 - and
18:51 - appearance of children let's look at
18:52 - that
18:55 - number of parents children aboard the
18:57 - titanic
18:59 - number of sibling spouses aboard the
19:00 - titanic
19:06 - we're going to look at sibling spouses
19:08 - we'll convert that to a dimension
19:12 - swap that
19:14 - out
19:17 - there we go
19:20 - rename this sibling
19:23 - spouse
19:27 - and i'm going to create one more
19:29 - chart one more sheet
19:31 - and it's basically going to be whether
19:32 - or not they survive just to get a feel
19:34 - for you know out of all the passengers
19:37 - how many survived
19:39 - so i'm going to pull over the survived
19:43 - variable here and then number of records
19:47 - and
19:48 - this does not look very nice right so we
19:50 - can actually change the chart type over
19:52 - here if you click on
19:54 - show me
19:55 - over here in the top right corner i'm
19:57 - going to actually just create a pie
19:58 - chart i feel like that
20:00 - makes a lot of sense for
20:02 - this
20:05 - type of information
20:06 - you know it's going to be one or the
20:07 - other they survived or they didn't
20:08 - survive and i can drag that out to make
20:10 - a little bit bigger
20:12 - and when you click on the pie chart
20:15 - option here
20:16 - it automatically
20:18 - adds these labels and what i can do in
20:20 - order to add the labels to the
20:23 - visual itself is control
20:26 - left click
20:27 - and drag that up to the label
20:29 - command left click if you're on a mac
20:33 - and then
20:34 - i can add
20:39 - okay so that worked now i want to add
20:40 - survived
20:42 - the one and the zero so one represents
20:46 - a survivor zero represents a
20:48 - non-survivor
20:51 - we'll name that sheet survived
21:02 - okay so now we have four sheets we have
21:05 - age passenger class sibling spouse and
21:07 - survived
21:10 - and that's great we can actually use
21:12 - this information to create a dashboard
21:14 - in tableau and i'm going to get that to
21:16 - that in a second but what i want to
21:17 - cover
21:18 - very quickly
21:20 - is how to create your own measure okay
21:23 - so i'm going to use age for this i'm
21:25 - going to instead of using the bins
21:27 - create a calculated field
21:32 - we'll call it custom age
21:34 - bins
21:37 - we're going to say if age
21:45 - is less than or equal to
21:48 - 10
21:51 - then
21:54 - 0 to 10.
21:58 - else
22:00 - if
22:02 - age
22:07 - greater than 10.
22:12 - and age
22:15 - less than or equal to
22:19 - let's just say 20
22:24 - then 11 to 20.
22:32 - else if
22:34 - you get the idea i'm not going to do
22:35 - this for every age bucket um
22:38 - we'll just lump everybody else in
22:42 - over over 20.
22:45 - um
22:46 - we'll just put them in 20 plus so
22:47 - they're 20 years plus
22:50 - and then if i add the end
22:54 - there
22:56 - i've got lsif and an else so i'm going
22:59 - to go ahead and remove
23:01 - elsif and then i have an else which will
23:02 - be the catch-all at the end if it
23:04 - doesn't fall within one of these buckets
23:05 - and then the end of the statement
23:08 - apply
23:12 - and now i'm going to duplicate the age
23:13 - tab
23:16 - for this example and swap out age bin
23:19 - for my custom age group
23:23 - custom age bin
23:25 - so now you can see it's 0 through 10 11
23:27 - through 20 20 plus and
23:29 - you know we can use the bin function to
23:31 - do that really quickly i think the point
23:33 - of that exercise was to show you how to
23:35 - create a calculated field
23:37 - so i really don't need that anymore so
23:38 - i'm going to delete it
23:40 - so now we want to take these sheets
23:43 - that we've created and we want to make a
23:45 - dashboard okay
23:48 - so to do that you can see these three
23:50 - tabs here
23:51 - below with the
23:53 - little chart there and then the four
23:55 - boxes and then what's called a story
23:57 - we want to click on the
23:59 - the dashboard by the new dashboard
24:01 - button
24:03 - okay so what this does is creates a
24:04 - blank canvas for us to create a
24:06 - dashboard and this thing always for
24:08 - whatever reason the size is always
24:11 - wrong so i just change it click on this
24:13 - little down
24:15 - arrow here and then the other one
24:17 - right below it and choose automatic and
24:19 - it expands it
24:21 - to fit your screen and then we just
24:22 - double click each of these sheets
24:24 - so age class sibling survived
24:27 - okay
24:30 - that was really fast really easy
24:32 - to kind of pull this stuff together
24:35 - and add it to a dashboard
24:38 - and i don't like this number of records
24:40 - thing every i can click on it and check
24:42 - you know hit the x and it will remove it
24:45 - and let's say i want to have survived up
24:46 - here in the top section i can move
24:49 - i can move that around
24:51 - you can drag and drop these
24:55 - sections
24:56 - to fit your needs
24:59 - there we go
25:00 - let's say i want to expand this some you
25:02 - can actually just hover your mouse out a
25:05 - little ways
25:06 - and
25:10 - drag that so that it stands out a little
25:12 - bit more
25:13 - and you can change the colors here
25:17 - so i can change the survived or
25:19 - non-survived
25:20 - i'm going to change that to green to
25:22 - record you know
25:23 - i'm sorry change the one to green to
25:25 - represent that they survived and then
25:26 - the zeroed to red
25:29 - i could do that here and it will change
25:30 - all of them
25:33 - there you go
25:35 - some nice christmas colors
25:37 - but
25:39 - we can drag this over as well
25:41 - to make it fit
25:43 - more symmetrical and then
25:45 - increase the size of this
25:48 - as well
25:49 - and reposition it
25:51 - so
25:52 - we just in a matter of minutes we're
25:53 - able to create sheets
25:56 - and then a dashboard and yeah that's
25:58 - really fantastic i don't
26:01 - all these other tools that you could use
26:02 - like click or d3
26:05 - or i
26:07 - i don't know it takes a while it's it
26:09 - you got to know how to code in those
26:12 - software programs in order to make the
26:13 - visualizations
26:15 - and it
26:17 - you know it's just a pain so the thing i
26:19 - like about tableau is it's it's really
26:21 - easy i compare it to to like an iphone
26:24 - where p someone a child can basically
26:26 - pick up an iphone
26:27 - and immediately start using it it's that
26:29 - intuitive
26:31 - you know tableau is that way for
26:32 - visualization it's really that simple
26:35 - you just literally drag and drop
26:37 - until you get what you want
26:39 - so i really actually don't like these
26:40 - colors especially the red
26:43 - maybe we'll just add
26:45 - the blue back
26:50 - okay that's a little bit better
26:53 - but anyway we only dealt with a few of
26:54 - these variables here
26:56 - you can get a feel for you know how many
26:57 - people survived
26:59 - you know it looks like and we we could
27:01 - actually add the percentages here as
27:03 - well um
27:05 - but it looks like
27:06 - you know most people did not survive
27:08 - so it's really sad
27:10 - um and you can look at
27:12 - at this chart here and say
27:14 - you know out of the people that did
27:15 - survive it looks like you know if they
27:17 - were between the ages of 20 and 30 you
27:18 - had a better success rate there
27:20 - and for the passenger classes it looks
27:22 - like if you were
27:24 - you know in the first class you had a
27:25 - better shot
27:26 - you know 15
27:27 - percent versus
27:30 - you know less than 10 percent here and
27:32 - then 13 here
27:35 - and siblings and spouses those that had
27:38 - um i guess fewer siblings and spouses
27:41 - they they survived at a higher rate
27:43 - which is
27:44 - um
27:45 - obviously pretty sad
27:47 - but
27:48 - this this really kind of brings to life
27:50 - the data
27:51 - we we all know what happened with the
27:53 - titanic
27:54 - and if we were to just look at this data
27:56 - here in the data source
27:58 - you know just looking at this
28:01 - you know there's only 891 rows you might
28:04 - be able to even look at this and sort of
28:05 - pick up some trends but what if that
28:07 - number was 8 million rows right there's
28:10 - no way you could could go through that
28:12 - data and honestly there's no way you
28:14 - could get this data into excel
28:16 - i know they have excel's gotten better
28:21 - but just the
28:22 - expedience with which you can pull data
28:25 - in and look at it i i'm not sure that
28:28 - you could do that with any other
28:29 - software that's available
28:31 - and then quickly create these sheets and
28:33 - dashboards so
28:35 - and thanks for watching
28:39 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone and welcome to this tutorial on tableau for data science we're going to cover a few basic features of tableau and how i use it for data science and how it can kind of fit into your workflow here's an example of a data science workflow we have in this example six different components and this is going to be different you know depending on what type of environment you're working in but generally you're going to have the data collection data exploration through the data wrangling data munching stage where you have to pull everything together and clean it for modeling and then the next step would be modeling validation and then reporting so the way i use tableau primarily is in the exploration phase and then in the reporting phase so expiration i want to basically be able to look at the data once i collect it i want to be able to look at the different variables that exist i want to see you know how the data is um distributed for example for each variable i want to see if there's any outliers or anything like that that i want to kick out from the uh the modeling because you know if you feed bad data into this model you're going to get some you know your garbage in garbage out so being able to explore the data i find is is really helpful and sometimes that's really all you need to know if you should move forward or not you know if you're trying to look to see if there's some kind of a relationship between variables sometimes a quick exploration and tableau a nice visual will help give you that and then also in the reporting side so once you've built your model you validated it and you want to be able to share your results with others tableau is also you know ideal for that they have great reporting tools it doesn't matter really what kind of organization you're in you you can pass you know if you have tableau server or or not you can you can pass your workbooks on to others so that they can view them as well so what is tableau so we kind of covered it briefly in the last slide but it's just a business intelligence slash data visualization tool that allows you to make sense of your data really by by looking at it right i mean sometimes we're we're looking at millions of rows of data you could check maybe the first hundred or you know first few thousand and look at the data but that's really not efficient and it's really not it's really not feasible these days to be able to just look at the data and figure out what's going on with big data and there's millions tens of millions of rows billions of rows potentially and being able to throw this stuff quickly into a tool like tableau and look at it really really helps a lot so here you have tableau desktop and then the server version so that we're going to be using the desktop version today specifically tableau public which is free you can download it for free from their website and that's just the software that you download to your computer and then the server version actually is within the browser you can create charts and dashboards and then upload that to the server for consumption throughout your organization so the interface here for tableau desktop is is really just drag and drop it reminds me of a pivot table in excel so you drag you know the columns and rows around to get what you want and and the way that this works is these are the fields here um and it's broken down into dimensions and measures so a dimension i think of a dimension as basically a category or a categorical variable and then a measure is a numerical value so it could be the number of records it could be any number of things and then here you have a filter you can apply a filter here and i'll show you how to use this section later the filter in the mark section but moving over here here's where you placed your columns and rows so if i want to basically show in column form i want to be able to let's just say pull in current status here to the columns and then number of records to the row then it would give me the current status categories along the xaxis and then the volumes for that category along the yaxis here so we're going to go over this with the live demo here but just want to give you a brief introduction to the interface and and how it's set up and this is the end result you know once you're able to make a few charts you could pull it together and make a dashboard like this for example so now we're going to go ahead and download tableau public i've just googled tableau public here and you're gonna have to put in your your email address here to download the app go ahead and put mine in there and download it may take a while depending on your internet speed but it's generally pretty quick so go ahead and install that on your computer i'm going to fast forward the video here so that you don't have to watch this entire install but feel free to pause the video and hit play again when you're ready to go okay so now i've downloaded tableau public i have the shortcut here was installed on my desktop and here we needed to connect to a file so it gives you several options here excel text json access pdf spatial or statistical file and the difference between the tableau public version and the tableau desktop which is the paid version it's about 850 dollars is that you're you're limited to just a handful of inputs here hand just a handful of file types um the desktop version really has has more options here and you can you know you can connect to a server like um azure or any sort of cloud environment so aws azure or google cloud and pull your data in directly from there here so we need to go ahead and get our data set and the data set i'm going to use for this tutorial is the titanic data set from kaggle and i'll include links to tableau public and this data set in the video description you'll just click on that and you'll probably have to sign up if you don't have a kaggle account already and basically what this is is kaggle is is essentially just sort of the online olympics for data nerds you you have competitions for machine learning deep learning models companies can actually post their their data sets on kaggle and have basically the best data scientists in the world compete to build the best model and the winner can actually earn money so it's pretty cool so we're gonna go ahead and i've already got an account so i'm gonna sign in here and once you're logged in you can go to the data tab here and then we're gonna actually use train dot csv let's go ahead and download that i'm just going to go ahead and move that to my desktop and now we're going to connect to that csv file so it looks like an excel file but it's really a flat csv file test one so we're going to use text file input here navigate to the desktop pull that in and once you open tableau public and import your data set it's basically just going to show you all of the data fields that exist and you may not know what those what those are so passenger id survived passenger class name example for example so kaggle actually has a data dictionary here on the data set page so survival is a categorical variable one standing for yes two meaning know that they didn't survive passenger class is the ticket class so first second third class sex is the gender male or female age in years number of siblings parents children above the titanic for the following variables and then ticket picket number fair cabin number so the cabin number could be indicative of where they were located on the ship and then embarked as their report of embarkation so just just looking at this data dictionary you can kind of get a feel for which variables might be useful and which variables may not be useful at all so survival obviously is is very important we want to look at the correlation between these variables these other variables and whether or not the passenger survived so now we're going to go back to tableau passenger id that's going to be probably not very useful survive that's going to be very important passenger class passenger name is not going to be very important the ticket number is unlikely to be significant fair that's how much they paid cabin number and embarked so you can see we have all these columns here and you can always reference the data dictionary so we're going to go ahead and click on sheet 1 at the bottom and you can look how tableau automatically pulls in these different variables so they it makes a determination based on the type of data being pulled in whether it should be a dimension or a measure so in this class i'm sorry in this example we're going to really just want to look at the number of records and how the number of records relate to these different categories and whether the passenger survives we're going to actually go ahead and make all of these a dimension so for age to become a dimension we may put that into different bins so if i want to do that automatically for example if i want to choose an age let me range ahead and give an example here if i want to show this going down you can see here that it's it's just a measure here so it's adding up all the ages but what i really want to see is you know is there sort of a correlation between the age and whether or not the person survives so we actually want to create a measure based on this age measure create a dimension i'm sorry based on this age measure and we can do that automatically by creating bins so we can call it age bin and the size of the bin is basically the number of years between each bucket we'll just do 10 years and if we pull that in there you see we have a null value we'll go ahead and pull in the number of records and then circle back to that null so here we go now we have a distribution of all passengers on the titanic we're going to go ahead and pull out the null here it's very important to note that when i pull this over i'm not just clicking on it and pulling it over i'm hitting on a pc control on a mac you would use the command button and then left click at the same time and pulling this field over to the filters bar and if i uncheck the null value there apply and then okay that gives me the distribution without the null values so this is great but you know i want to have some context here by adding percentages so if i take number of records here again and pull it up to the rows bar and then hit this down arrow here and you basically have this drop down and then quick table calculation and then percent of total okay so now what that did is add we have the volumes here above and then the percent of total below but i really don't have any labels so i need to add the labels here so this makes sense in the marks bar this basically allows you to change the coloring the labels the size of your chart and you have three in this example you have three sections you have all the section which is the summation of all the records and then this bottom one represents the basically the percent of total so for the second one we want to go ahead and pull in the labels here to add the labels the column labels to each each bar so i'm going to hit control on my pc command on a mac and then left click hold those together and then drag it over to the labels box and you can see that it adds the labels there we're going to do the same thing now but for the bottom section and the percent of total control left click hold and then move it down to the label section you can see now on top we have the volumes and then the percentage of the total number of records below so this is great but what it really doesn't give us is whether you know we want to know if age was an influencing variable on whether or not the passenger survived so we're going to use the survived variable here and it's a measure tabloid treated that as a measure when it pulled it in to the data set but we really want to treat that as a categorical variable so we want to convert it from a measure to a dimension and the way you do that is you hover over the the variable and click down here and then convert to dimension so now that's a dimension it moves up to from measures up to the to the dimension section and we want to color these bars based on whether the passenger survives or not so i'm going to hold down control and then left click on my pc command left click on the mac in order to drag this field over but i want to do i want to apply that color to both sections so i'm going to click on the all marks box here and then click on it control left click hold and then drag that over to color and then you can see this legend pops up over here on the right and what that represents is if it's orange then that represents a survivor the survivor portion of the population and blue is the nonsurvivor population so you can see what the distribution looks like here in terms of the total number of records by age bin and then you can compare you know each ratio the percentage each age bucket to see if that age grouping had a disproportionate survival rate relative to all the passengers so this is great we're going to call this i'm going to rename this tab so i just double clicked here on the sheet and we'll call it age okay and now the good part is that we've already built this out so we don't have to redo this for every variable so i'm going to right click here and then duplicate and so what i'm going to do now is just swap out age for another variable so in this case we're going to use passenger class so i want to get rid of age bin so what i did to get rid of that is i just clicked on it left clicked no control or command button just and then just dragged it below and that got you know that removed it from the filter and i can do the same thing here just drag it away and here we're just stuck with you know left with these the summations of each each category here so now i want to add passenger class this also was treated as a measure so we want to convert that to a dimension drag that over we only have three classes here i can drag this over this chart to expand it so that it makes more sense we do not have any null values here which is great and you can see that it automatically populates everything so that's that's great we can change the name here to p class to represent passenger class duplicate that and appearance of children let's look at that number of parents children aboard the titanic number of sibling spouses aboard the titanic we're going to look at sibling spouses we'll convert that to a dimension swap that out there we go rename this sibling spouse and i'm going to create one more chart one more sheet and it's basically going to be whether or not they survive just to get a feel for you know out of all the passengers how many survived so i'm going to pull over the survived variable here and then number of records and this does not look very nice right so we can actually change the chart type over here if you click on show me over here in the top right corner i'm going to actually just create a pie chart i feel like that makes a lot of sense for this type of information you know it's going to be one or the other they survived or they didn't survive and i can drag that out to make a little bit bigger and when you click on the pie chart option here it automatically adds these labels and what i can do in order to add the labels to the visual itself is control left click and drag that up to the label command left click if you're on a mac and then i can add okay so that worked now i want to add survived the one and the zero so one represents a survivor zero represents a nonsurvivor we'll name that sheet survived okay so now we have four sheets we have age passenger class sibling spouse and survived and that's great we can actually use this information to create a dashboard in tableau and i'm going to get that to that in a second but what i want to cover very quickly is how to create your own measure okay so i'm going to use age for this i'm going to instead of using the bins create a calculated field we'll call it custom age bins we're going to say if age is less than or equal to 10 then 0 to 10. else if age greater than 10. and age less than or equal to let's just say 20 then 11 to 20. else if you get the idea i'm not going to do this for every age bucket um we'll just lump everybody else in over over 20. um we'll just put them in 20 plus so they're 20 years plus and then if i add the end there i've got lsif and an else so i'm going to go ahead and remove elsif and then i have an else which will be the catchall at the end if it doesn't fall within one of these buckets and then the end of the statement apply and now i'm going to duplicate the age tab for this example and swap out age bin for my custom age group custom age bin so now you can see it's 0 through 10 11 through 20 20 plus and you know we can use the bin function to do that really quickly i think the point of that exercise was to show you how to create a calculated field so i really don't need that anymore so i'm going to delete it so now we want to take these sheets that we've created and we want to make a dashboard okay so to do that you can see these three tabs here below with the little chart there and then the four boxes and then what's called a story we want to click on the the dashboard by the new dashboard button okay so what this does is creates a blank canvas for us to create a dashboard and this thing always for whatever reason the size is always wrong so i just change it click on this little down arrow here and then the other one right below it and choose automatic and it expands it to fit your screen and then we just double click each of these sheets so age class sibling survived okay that was really fast really easy to kind of pull this stuff together and add it to a dashboard and i don't like this number of records thing every i can click on it and check you know hit the x and it will remove it and let's say i want to have survived up here in the top section i can move i can move that around you can drag and drop these sections to fit your needs there we go let's say i want to expand this some you can actually just hover your mouse out a little ways and drag that so that it stands out a little bit more and you can change the colors here so i can change the survived or nonsurvived i'm going to change that to green to record you know i'm sorry change the one to green to represent that they survived and then the zeroed to red i could do that here and it will change all of them there you go some nice christmas colors but we can drag this over as well to make it fit more symmetrical and then increase the size of this as well and reposition it so we just in a matter of minutes we're able to create sheets and then a dashboard and yeah that's really fantastic i don't all these other tools that you could use like click or d3 or i i don't know it takes a while it's it you got to know how to code in those software programs in order to make the visualizations and it you know it's just a pain so the thing i like about tableau is it's it's really easy i compare it to to like an iphone where p someone a child can basically pick up an iphone and immediately start using it it's that intuitive you know tableau is that way for visualization it's really that simple you just literally drag and drop until you get what you want so i really actually don't like these colors especially the red maybe we'll just add the blue back okay that's a little bit better but anyway we only dealt with a few of these variables here you can get a feel for you know how many people survived you know it looks like and we we could actually add the percentages here as well um but it looks like you know most people did not survive so it's really sad um and you can look at at this chart here and say you know out of the people that did survive it looks like you know if they were between the ages of 20 and 30 you had a better success rate there and for the passenger classes it looks like if you were you know in the first class you had a better shot you know 15 percent versus you know less than 10 percent here and then 13 here and siblings and spouses those that had um i guess fewer siblings and spouses they they survived at a higher rate which is um obviously pretty sad but this this really kind of brings to life the data we we all know what happened with the titanic and if we were to just look at this data here in the data source you know just looking at this you know there's only 891 rows you might be able to even look at this and sort of pick up some trends but what if that number was 8 million rows right there's no way you could could go through that data and honestly there's no way you could get this data into excel i know they have excel's gotten better but just the expedience with which you can pull data in and look at it i i'm not sure that you could do that with any other software that's available and then quickly create these sheets and dashboards so and thanks for watching
