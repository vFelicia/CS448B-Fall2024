00:00 - template literals template literals are
00:02 - string literals allowing embedded
00:04 - expressions you can use multi-line
00:07 - strings and string interpolation
00:08 - features with them template literals are
00:11 - enclosed by this bag the backtick with
00:13 - the back that key is right next to the
00:16 - one on the keyboard first I want to show
00:18 - you multi-line strings now you can see
00:26 - these this is on two different lines in
00:28 - the console normally it you can't just
00:32 - put extra lines and have it make a new
00:34 - line in the console that put a few more
00:36 - lines like as you can see it's gonna put
00:38 - a lot of lines in between these two
00:40 - lines another thing you can do with
00:42 - template literals are is expression
00:44 - interpolation let me give you an example
00:46 - of that so if I run this you can see
00:57 - it's the expression interpolation
00:59 - happens with these symbols there's a
01:01 - dollar sign and then these squiggly
01:04 - brackets and and anything inside the
01:06 - dollar sign the squiggly brackets is
01:08 - going to evaluate and put the answer
01:10 - right into your string same with right
01:14 - over here and you can see that it adds a
01:17 - plus B Phi plus Inc we get the 15 over
01:19 - here and that does also two times a plus
01:21 - B over here to get the 20 you can still
01:24 - use the the newline just like you would
01:28 - do in a regular string you don't have to
01:30 - give it a newline but that would work if
01:32 - I just put new a new line just like that
01:34 - you can see it's gonna be exactly the
01:36 - same the next thing I want to talk to
01:38 - you about is tagged template literals
01:40 - this is basically passing a template
01:43 - literal into a function let me show you
01:52 - so I have my function written and now
01:55 - I'm going to pass a template literal
01:58 - into that function this function is
01:59 - called tag but it doesn't matter what
02:01 - the function is called and let me run
02:08 - that so you can see the last two lines
02:11 - here is what happens from the this tag
02:13 - template literal example it's going to
02:15 - run the function tag and it's going to
02:17 - input input this tip template literal
02:19 - all the strings go into this strings
02:23 - array and the values go into the value
02:26 - array if you have dot that dot that just
02:27 - means a a an array here so the strings
02:31 - you can see our hello there's also so
02:35 - you can see the hello here and then
02:37 - world right there is right here in the
02:41 - in the console and then there's nothing
02:44 - right between this last expression and
02:48 - the back tick there's nothing there so
02:50 - that's shown in the console with an
02:53 - empty string now you can see the values
02:56 - in the console 15 and 50 well it passes
02:59 - in the expressions as the values so this
03:03 - skips passed in as 15 because 5 plus 10
03:07 - is 15 and then this gets passed in as 50
03:10 - so it it goes through the whole template
03:13 - literal first it takes out the strings
03:16 - and then it takes out the the values as
03:19 - as the expressions in this function I
03:22 - had returned GS nuggets but it's not
03:24 - we're not doing anything with that so we
03:26 - can do this if we consult log this and
03:29 - then we run this you can see that it's
03:32 - gonna print print J's nuggets at the end
03:35 - now I want to show you a more
03:37 - complicated way of using tag template
03:41 - literals ok this code I copied right
03:43 - from the Mozilla developer Network page
03:46 - on template literals and this code right
03:49 - here and I just want to walk you through
03:50 - it this is the function and we're gonna
03:56 - have this we're going to assign this
03:58 - variable down here t1 closure to
04:02 - this the function template and we're
04:05 - gonna pass in this template literal here
04:08 - I'm going to uncomment out this console
04:11 - dot log and we're gonna run this we're
04:14 - gonna look at the very bottom where it
04:15 - says yay so when we passed in we called
04:21 - the t1 variable and we passed in the
04:24 - letters wine a it print printed yay
04:27 - let's walk through why that actually
04:30 - happened in our previous example of the
04:35 - tag template literals we returned a
04:37 - string but you don't have to return a
04:39 - string because in this function we
04:42 - actually return a function the strings
04:46 - and the keys from the that we pass into
04:49 - the original function are right here so
04:53 - we're passing in this template literal
04:56 - that becomes they gets broken into the
04:58 - strings and the keys then we are down
05:02 - here we're calling the t1 closure
05:05 - variable and we're passing the Y in the
05:08 - a into the function that's being
05:11 - returned by the template one way to help
05:15 - you understand this better is we're
05:16 - going to console dot log the strings
05:19 - here and the keys and then comment out
05:28 - this and I'm going to run it and you can
05:31 - see at the bottom the strings here where
05:34 - you console that lock the strings that's
05:35 - blank blank string blank string
05:38 - exclamation Park exclamation point
05:41 - because there's it gives you a blank
05:44 - string because there's nothing between
05:46 - these these expressions in the template
05:50 - literal and then we have the exclamation
05:51 - point at the end and then it's 0 1 0
05:55 - this what we get when we pass in these
05:57 - expressions 0 1 0 that's the keys from
06:01 - here so now we're going to return this
06:04 - this function and the values from this
06:07 - function come from the Y and the a so
06:10 - let's go through this VAR dick equals
06:13 - values so we're going
06:15 - to the values array and we're finding
06:18 - this index values dot length minus 1 so
06:23 - that's gonna be the last item in the
06:25 - values array so remember the values
06:28 - array is why a and the last value is a
06:31 - so we now have our result equals an
06:35 - array C it's surrounded by these
06:37 - brackets and inside the array array
06:39 - we're gonna access this other array the
06:40 - strings array which is right over here
06:43 - if you look in the console dot log the
06:45 - array at index 0 is nothing so the
06:47 - result is going to currently equal
06:50 - nothing now Keys dot for each so we're
06:54 - going to loop through each of the keys
06:55 - now remember the keys if you look at the
06:58 - console the keys arrayed are 0 1 0 for
07:02 - each key we're on the the first key 0
07:05 - VAR value equals number that is integer
07:08 - key so it's 0 number yes it is a number
07:11 - and in fact 0 1 0 those are all numbers
07:14 - so this is a ternary operator if the it
07:18 - is a number and all these are numbers
07:19 - we're gonna do the first thing before
07:21 - the colon if they weren't a number we do
07:24 - the second thing if you look at down at
07:27 - line 43 at one of these examples we have
07:31 - something that's not a number but for
07:35 - this example all of our numbers so we
07:39 - are going to go to the values array and
07:41 - go to the index of the key remember the
07:44 - values array is right here Y a and we
07:47 - have the index the first the first key
07:51 - is 0 so that would be Y and this is
07:55 - result that pushed the value and that
07:57 - values of Y or Y and we're also going to
08:00 - push the strings array I plus 1 so I is
08:04 - 0 so that b1 the strings array is red it
08:07 - is here 0 plus 1 is going to be it still
08:11 - an empty string so it's not going to
08:13 - push anything so this is going to just
08:14 - push Y now I'm going to go through it
08:17 - again and we're going to use the next
08:19 - key which is 1 so the next key 1 is
08:23 - going to bring up the a here and when it
08:28 - does result that puts out
08:29 - it's gonna push the a in here and that's
08:32 - going to go through a third time we have
08:35 - the key zero which is going to go back
08:38 - to the Y and this time we're gonna push
08:40 - the Y and when we go to strings I plus
08:44 - one
08:44 - well I plus one is going to be two plus
08:46 - one which is going to be three so this
08:49 - is the strings array this time it's not
08:51 - going to push on an empty string it's
08:53 - going to push on the exclamation point
08:55 - at the very end and then return results
08:58 - dot join so we have an array which is
09:01 - just Y a Y estimation points and when we
09:04 - join each item in the array it's going
09:07 - to put on to one string and that's how
09:10 - we get Y a for this string at the end
09:14 - now if i uncomment out these and run
09:19 - this you can see that this is going to
09:23 - do that it's gonna go through the same
09:24 - thing but it's gonna eventually get to
09:28 - this hello world and if you want to go
09:31 - through individually and see how that
09:32 - all works out you can thanks for

Cleaned transcript:

template literals template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions you can use multiline strings and string interpolation features with them template literals are enclosed by this bag the backtick with the back that key is right next to the one on the keyboard first I want to show you multiline strings now you can see these this is on two different lines in the console normally it you can't just put extra lines and have it make a new line in the console that put a few more lines like as you can see it's gonna put a lot of lines in between these two lines another thing you can do with template literals are is expression interpolation let me give you an example of that so if I run this you can see it's the expression interpolation happens with these symbols there's a dollar sign and then these squiggly brackets and and anything inside the dollar sign the squiggly brackets is going to evaluate and put the answer right into your string same with right over here and you can see that it adds a plus B Phi plus Inc we get the 15 over here and that does also two times a plus B over here to get the 20 you can still use the the newline just like you would do in a regular string you don't have to give it a newline but that would work if I just put new a new line just like that you can see it's gonna be exactly the same the next thing I want to talk to you about is tagged template literals this is basically passing a template literal into a function let me show you so I have my function written and now I'm going to pass a template literal into that function this function is called tag but it doesn't matter what the function is called and let me run that so you can see the last two lines here is what happens from the this tag template literal example it's going to run the function tag and it's going to input input this tip template literal all the strings go into this strings array and the values go into the value array if you have dot that dot that just means a a an array here so the strings you can see our hello there's also so you can see the hello here and then world right there is right here in the in the console and then there's nothing right between this last expression and the back tick there's nothing there so that's shown in the console with an empty string now you can see the values in the console 15 and 50 well it passes in the expressions as the values so this skips passed in as 15 because 5 plus 10 is 15 and then this gets passed in as 50 so it it goes through the whole template literal first it takes out the strings and then it takes out the the values as as the expressions in this function I had returned GS nuggets but it's not we're not doing anything with that so we can do this if we consult log this and then we run this you can see that it's gonna print print J's nuggets at the end now I want to show you a more complicated way of using tag template literals ok this code I copied right from the Mozilla

t1 closure to this the function template and we're gonna pass in this template literal here I'm going to uncomment out this console dot log and we're gonna run this we're gonna look at the very bottom where it says yay so when we passed in we called the t1 variable and we passed in the letters wine a it print printed yay let's walk through why that actually happened in our previous example of the tag template literals we returned a string but you don't have to return a string because in this function we actually return a function the strings and the keys from the that we pass into the original function are right here so we're passing in this template literal that becomes they gets broken into the strings and the keys then we are down here we're calling the t1 closure variable and we're passing the Y in the a into the function that's being returned by the template one way to help you understand this better is we're going to console dot log the strings here and the keys and then comment out this and I'm going to run it and you can see at the bottom the strings here where you console that lock the strings that's blank blank string blank string exclamation Park exclamation point because there's it gives you a blank string because there's nothing between these these expressions in the template literal and then we have the exclamation point at the end and then it's 0 1 0 this what we get when we pass in these expressions 0 1 0 that's the keys from here so now we're going to return this this function and the values from this function come from the Y and the a so let's go through this VAR dick equals values so we're going to the values array and we're finding this index values dot length minus 1 so that's gonna be the last item in the values array so remember the values array is why a and the last value is a so we now have our result equals an array C it's surrounded by these brackets and inside the array array we're gonna access this other array the strings

each of the keys now remember the keys if you look at the console the keys arrayed are 0 1 0 for each key we're on the the first key 0 VAR value equals number that is integer key so it's 0 number yes it is a number and in fact 0 1 0 those are all numbers so this is a ternary operator if the it is a number and all these are numbers we're gonna do the first thing before the colon if they weren't a number we do the second thing if you look at down at line 43 at one of these examples we have something that's not a number but for this example all of our numbers so we are going to go to the values array and go to the index of the key remember the values array is right here Y a and we have the index the first the first key is 0 so that would be Y and this is result that pushed the value and that values of Y or Y and we're also going to push the strings array I plus 1 so I is 0 so that b1 the strings array is red it is here 0 plus 1 is going to be it still an empty string so it's not going to push anything so this is going to just push Y now I'm going to go through it again and we're going to use the next key which is 1 so the next key 1 is going to bring up the a here and when it does result that puts out it's gonna push the a in here and that's going to go through a third time we have the key zero which is going to go back to the Y and this time we're gonna push the Y and when we

eventually get to this hello world and if you want to go through individually and see how that all works out you can thanks for watching my name is beau Carnes check the description for links to more
