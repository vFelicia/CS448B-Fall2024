00:00 - good day everybody welcome back to css3
00:02 - in 30 days today is day number 28 and
00:04 - instead of coding in this lesson we're
00:06 - going to spend a little bit of time
00:08 - talking about optimizing your css3 good
00:12 - clean code is always a great idea here
00:14 - are some hot tips on optimizing your
00:17 - css3 first of all code better you got to
00:20 - do the work right the first time don't
00:22 - rely on optimization tools to make you a
00:25 - good css3 coder as i always like to say
00:29 - crap in crap out that simply means if
00:32 - you are putting something terrible into
00:34 - the machine something terrible will come
00:36 - out no matter how much you prettify or
00:39 - optimize or compress
00:40 - the darn thing if you're doing a bad job
00:43 - in it's going to be a bad job coming out
00:45 - so remember crap in crap out when coding
00:48 - your css use shallow selectors instead
00:51 - of really long and messy redundant
00:53 - selectors and that simply means if you
00:55 - can select simply the id of awesome
00:58 - don't select div
01:00 - paragraph tag span m id of awesome
01:05 - just simply using the id of awesome is
01:08 - good enough that in and of itself is
01:10 - smart css3 coding utilize good code
01:14 - organization so instead of when you have
01:16 - an idea for a style just throwing it at
01:18 - the bottom of your css style sheet
01:21 - find out where a good place for that
01:23 - piece of code is and a nice little tip
01:27 - is put a table of contents in a comment
01:30 - up at the very top of your style sheet
01:32 - if you have a really big and heavy css
01:34 - style sheet have some organization and
01:37 - have a way that you in the future can
01:39 - revisit your code or if you're handing
01:41 - off the project to somebody else they
01:43 - can see what the heck you were doing use
01:46 - shorthand where possible so instead of
01:48 - margin top 20 pixels margin right 20
01:51 - pixels margin bottom 20 pixels margin
01:54 - left 20 pixels just say margin 20 pixels
01:58 - and treat your css 3 like it is art
02:02 - it's not just letters in a code editor
02:06 - it's your art it's your craft it's what
02:08 - makes the web run or at least it what
02:11 - it's what makes the web look good so
02:14 - treat it like it is art because
02:16 - arguably it is
02:18 - hot tip number two validate your code
02:21 - sometimes the smallest error in your
02:23 - code can cause the biggest headache so
02:25 - be smart and use one of those free and
02:27 - awesome tools out there like this one
02:29 - it's just cssportal.com css dash
02:32 - optimize all you got to do is google css
02:35 - optimizer or optimize your css there's a
02:37 - lot of tools out there this is one that
02:39 - i found and i'll just show you real
02:40 - quick how it works so i have some css
02:43 - here queued up i'm just going to hit
02:44 - paste
02:46 - relatively short css file but what i'm
02:49 - going to do is i'm going to optimize it
02:51 - by compressing it
02:53 - and choosing different settings here in
02:55 - the tool so standard let's see let's
02:57 - make it
02:58 - let's start here highest no readability
03:00 - smallest size if you have a production
03:03 - ready style sheet that you want to have
03:06 - ready to go then you can have it at its
03:08 - highest compression because you don't
03:09 - need to be able to read it and modify it
03:11 - that's for developers only when you want
03:12 - to be able to
03:14 - see all your code easily see the
03:16 - organization the table of contents the
03:17 - comments everything like that
03:19 - production ready live sites you don't
03:22 - really need to have it be that readable
03:24 - so i'm going to say highest this option
03:27 - preserve css you can save the comments
03:29 - hacks and so on and so forth by default
03:30 - they have it turned off i would keep it
03:32 - off for now if you're having it be
03:33 - highly compressed you can sort the
03:35 - selectors it says use this with caution
03:37 - it may change the behavior of your css
03:38 - code because it's not a perfect tool
03:41 - sorting properties you can even sort the
03:43 - properties by i don't know what method
03:45 - they're sorting them but you can test it
03:47 - out and see what it does or you can
03:49 - leave it off
03:50 - you can also regroup selectors
03:53 - optimize shorthands all of these sorts
03:55 - of things are things that you can do
03:56 - better by
03:58 - coding better in the first place so my
04:00 - first tip was code better
04:02 - that saves you from having to sort your
04:04 - selectors and sort your properties just
04:07 - code properly so that you're not putting
04:08 - crap into the machine so it's gonna spit
04:10 - crap out that's why it has cautions
04:13 - optimize shorthands you can do safe
04:15 - optimizations or all optimizations some
04:17 - shorthands may be a little bit buggy so
04:19 - that's why you can use safe
04:20 - optimizations
04:22 - compress colors uh if you're using the
04:25 - the color pound three three three three
04:27 - three three you could simply say pound
04:29 - three three three and that's what this
04:31 - is going to do compressing font weights
04:33 - that will help you save some keystrokes
04:35 - or at least some kilobytes in your css
04:38 - file
04:39 - lowercase selectors this says it's
04:42 - lowercasing the element names for html
04:44 - xhtml but nobody cares about xhtml
04:46 - anymore so don't worry about that and
04:48 - any other elements here like remove
04:50 - unnecessary backslashes or remove the
04:52 - last semicolon little tip is in your
04:55 - code you don't actually have to have
04:58 - a semicolon on your last style so for
05:01 - example here
05:03 - in this entire selector final shadow
05:05 - typo right here this one doesn't
05:07 - actually need a semicolon but i always
05:10 - do it by default because i don't want to
05:11 - get into the habit when i'm writing
05:13 - vanilla css
05:14 - to forget the semicolon but in your
05:17 - production ready site
05:19 - and you're compressing your code you can
05:22 - have at it
05:23 - you can discard invalid properties and
05:24 - add a time stamp for when it was
05:26 - optimized up to you process that css
05:28 - lets you know what when what went on so
05:30 - it's saying uh if you're because i'm
05:33 - using css3 it's not it doesn't know
05:35 - what's going on so what i can do down
05:36 - here if i didn't want
05:39 - invalid properties i can discard them
05:40 - but i actually want them because i'm
05:41 - using css3 so here is the output right
05:44 - here this is one line so i'm going to
05:46 - copy that
05:49 - and show you what that looks like so
05:50 - this is the the the original file and
05:53 - this is what it would look like
05:56 - compressed
05:57 - that's it
05:59 - crazy
06:01 - it almost seems too short but that's
06:02 - that's what it is so right here i have
06:04 - about 39 lines of css right here i've
06:06 - got technically one line it's just one
06:08 - really long line so and that's all the
06:11 - browser will load so that's both
06:13 - validating and compressing it's letting
06:14 - you know any sort of messages here that
06:16 - you might need to know so that is a neat
06:18 - little tool the other thing which we
06:20 - just did was compress your css so when
06:22 - you're developing you want that css to
06:24 - be highly readable and easy to navigate
06:26 - with your comments the spacing the
06:28 - organization your table of contents the
06:30 - hacks and everything like that
06:31 - instructions for developers or
06:33 - co-developers but in like i said those
06:35 - production ready sites like a live
06:37 - client site or a live application web
06:39 - application you don't need all of that
06:41 - stuff because
06:42 - who's going to be reading that other
06:44 - developers who click developer inspect
06:45 - tools and read your css that's really it
06:48 - so in those live sites you don't need
06:51 - all of the all the organization all the
06:54 - comments and everything like that
06:56 - so
06:57 - what you can do a little tip is have a
07:00 - developer
07:01 - css file that is your let's call it
07:04 - app.css
07:06 - and then you have a folder called
07:07 - production and then in there you have
07:10 - another app.css the productionapp.css
07:13 - is the file that you would use to
07:17 - load that
07:18 - when you're doing the live site but when
07:20 - you're developing on the server you just
07:22 - simply use your developer version now to
07:24 - show you how you can kind of do that
07:27 - let's uh let's do an example here so
07:29 - codekit is one of my favorite developer
07:31 - tools codekit is a paid application
07:33 - there's a free trial uh it's
07:35 - codekitapp.com i highly suggest you
07:38 - support this guy it's just a single dude
07:40 - i don't know if he's single or not he is
07:42 - just a developer who builds an awesome
07:46 - tool called codekit i truly love it it's
07:49 - only like 30 bucks you can actually pay
07:51 - what you want anywhere between you know
07:53 - 25 and 35 bucks or whatever it is
07:56 - so i would recommend supporting him
07:58 - codekitapp.com
08:00 - basically this is like an all-in-one
08:02 - compression
08:03 - output developer tool
08:05 - you can you can do a ton with it but in
08:07 - a very basic way you can optimize your
08:10 - css
08:11 - and even compress images and do
08:13 - everything like that and have it
08:14 - automatically output into a folder that
08:17 - you want so for example i have a
08:20 - folder here called theme styles
08:23 - and then a couple
08:25 - css files here i can actually say output
08:27 - style compressed i can choose how i want
08:29 - it to be compressed
08:30 - and
08:31 - i can change the path so
08:34 - let me say i'm going to create a new
08:36 - folder called
08:37 - production like we just talked about and
08:40 - it's going to say
08:43 - the min
08:45 - production.css you can call whatever you
08:46 - want but i'm going to say
08:48 - this it's going to take that file and
08:50 - it's going to
08:51 - you know turn it into
08:53 - something when i hit process boom
08:56 - it's going to do that it compiled so in
08:58 - here now we have a production file
09:01 - called thememin production.css let's
09:02 - check it out
09:04 - so it's got all of the css
09:06 - that was in the original
09:08 - theme css
09:10 - so all of this
09:11 - is now compressed but i'm not
09:13 - overwriting this it's just got another
09:15 - file now the magic of this is i can have
09:18 - it run automatically
09:20 - when this file changes or builds so it's
09:22 - checking this file when it changes
09:24 - re-output so as a little example if i
09:26 - just delete everything and just say body
09:29 - font size 12 pixels and leave it at that
09:31 - and save
09:33 - it's going to re-output
09:35 - it just processed it and now that file
09:38 - is that
09:39 - so it automatically happens so you don't
09:41 - need to resave copy and paste take it
09:42 - down do this that and all the other
09:44 - things and i'm just going to change that
09:45 - back because that was a very important
09:47 - file so i'm going to go back hit save
09:49 - it's going to compile bam everything is
09:51 - back
09:52 - there we go so i would highly suggest
09:54 - using codekit for those production uh
09:56 - for deving and then needing production
09:58 - ready files you can optimize
10:00 - a ton of stuff
10:02 - but because this is css we're just going
10:03 - to talk about that the other thing that
10:05 - you can do is preload your css in the
10:08 - browser so
10:09 - uh you can improve the performance and
10:12 - the loading time of your styles on your
10:14 - websites by simply adding the following
10:17 - code link preload href and whatever your
10:20 - css is as styles so you're basically
10:22 - using the rel attribute to tell the
10:24 - browser to preload this file as a style
10:27 - and it will just check a little bit
10:29 - earlier and load that style up so
10:30 - there's less waiting time other thing
10:32 - you can do is lighten up those
10:34 - frameworks so bootstrap and other
10:37 - similar frameworks are notoriously heavy
10:39 - meaning that there are a lot of files
10:41 - functions assets and code that you
10:43 - simply do not need in the website maybe
10:46 - you're just using the framework for like
10:48 - the grid or button styles or base styles
10:51 - if that's the case for you then when you
10:54 - download the framework either remove
10:56 - everything except what you plan on using
10:59 - or just download specific files from the
11:02 - framework that you need
11:03 - load it up into your website your
11:05 - application and make that will make the
11:07 - resources quicker to load instead of
11:09 - using all of bootstrap you can just use
11:11 - this part of bootstrap that you actually
11:13 - need one last thing that i want to leave
11:15 - you with is learn a pre-processor
11:17 - language now i do have a course on sas
11:19 - you can check that out afterwards but
11:22 - you need to take advantage of a css
11:23 - preprocessor like sas or less and
11:26 - they'll not only save you coding time
11:28 - but they'll give you more flexibility
11:30 - when it comes to styling and you can
11:31 - export highly optimized images and
11:33 - create production-ready sites and
11:35 - applications uh but it's a really nice
11:37 - tool to know
11:39 - when coding i'm here coding vanilla css3
11:42 - and while it's great i'm
11:44 - spending a lot of time typing things
11:46 - that i don't need to type if i'm using a
11:48 - preprocessor i won't talk too much about
11:50 - that but i'd highly suggest checking out
11:53 - my course learn sas so those are my tips
11:56 - for optimizing that css code better
11:59 - validate compress
12:01 - preload lighten up those frameworks
12:04 - learn a preprocessor language and check
12:06 - out tools like codekit css optimize
12:10 - and i put a resource in the
12:13 - in the file in day number 28 called
12:15 - shorthand properties teaches you a
12:16 - little bit about using shorthands and a
12:19 - little bit of
12:20 - of how to improve your
12:22 - css coding so thanks for spending a
12:26 - little
12:27 - 15 minutes or so learning a little bit
12:29 - of theory and why you should optimize
12:31 - your css see you tomorrow in day number
12:33 - 29.

Cleaned transcript:

good day everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day number 28 and instead of coding in this lesson we're going to spend a little bit of time talking about optimizing your css3 good clean code is always a great idea here are some hot tips on optimizing your css3 first of all code better you got to do the work right the first time don't rely on optimization tools to make you a good css3 coder as i always like to say crap in crap out that simply means if you are putting something terrible into the machine something terrible will come out no matter how much you prettify or optimize or compress the darn thing if you're doing a bad job in it's going to be a bad job coming out so remember crap in crap out when coding your css use shallow selectors instead of really long and messy redundant selectors and that simply means if you can select simply the id of awesome don't select div paragraph tag span m id of awesome just simply using the id of awesome is good enough that in and of itself is smart css3 coding utilize good code organization so instead of when you have an idea for a style just throwing it at the bottom of your css style sheet find out where a good place for that piece of code is and a nice little tip is put a table of contents in a comment up at the very top of your style sheet if you have a really big and heavy css style sheet have some organization and have a way that you in the future can revisit your code or if you're handing off the project to somebody else they can see what the heck you were doing use shorthand where possible so instead of margin top 20 pixels margin right 20 pixels margin bottom 20 pixels margin left 20 pixels just say margin 20 pixels and treat your css 3 like it is art it's not just letters in a code editor it's your art it's your craft it's what makes the web run or at least it what it's what makes the web look good so treat it like it is art because arguably it is hot tip number two validate your code sometimes the smallest error in your code can cause the biggest headache so be smart and use one of those free and awesome tools out there like this one it's just cssportal.com css dash optimize all you got to do is google css optimizer or optimize your css there's a lot of tools out there this is one that i found and i'll just show you real quick how it works so i have some css here queued up i'm just going to hit paste relatively short css file but what i'm going to do is i'm going to optimize it by compressing it and choosing different settings here in the tool so standard let's see let's make it let's start here highest no readability smallest size if you have a production ready style sheet that you want to have ready to go then you can have it at its highest compression because you don't need to be able to read it and modify it that's for developers only when you want to be able to see all your code easily see the organization the table of contents the comments everything like that production ready live sites you don't really need to have it be that readable so i'm going to say highest this option preserve css you can save the comments hacks and so on and so forth by default they have it turned off i would keep it off for now if you're having it be highly compressed you can sort the selectors it says use this with caution it may change the behavior of your css code because it's not a perfect tool sorting properties you can even sort the properties by i don't know what method they're sorting them but you can test it out and see what it does or you can leave it off you can also regroup selectors optimize shorthands all of these sorts of things are things that you can do better by coding better in the first place so my first tip was code better that saves you from having to sort your selectors and sort your properties just code properly so that you're not putting crap into the machine so it's gonna spit crap out that's why it has cautions optimize shorthands you can do safe optimizations or all optimizations some shorthands may be a little bit buggy so that's why you can use safe optimizations compress colors uh if you're using the the color pound three three three three three three you could simply say pound three three three and that's what this is going to do compressing font weights that will help you save some keystrokes or at least some kilobytes in your css file lowercase selectors this says it's lowercasing the element names for html xhtml but nobody cares about xhtml anymore so don't worry about that and any other elements here like remove unnecessary backslashes or remove the last semicolon little tip is in your code you don't actually have to have a semicolon on your last style so for example here in this entire selector final shadow typo right here this one doesn't actually need a semicolon but i always do it by default because i don't want to get into the habit when i'm writing vanilla css to forget the semicolon but in your production ready site and you're compressing your code you can have at it you can discard invalid properties and add a time stamp for when it was optimized up to you process that

can discard them but i actually want them because i'm using css3 so here is the output right here this is one line so i'm going to copy that and show you what that looks like so this is the the the original file and this is what it would look like compressed that's it crazy it almost seems too short but that's that's what it is so right here i have about 39 lines of css right here i've got

but you need to take advantage of a css preprocessor like sas or less and they'll not only save you coding time but they'll give you more flexibility when it comes to styling and you can export highly optimized images and create productionready sites and applications uh but it's a really nice tool to know when coding i'm here coding vanilla css3 and while it's great i'm spending a lot of time typing things that i don't need to type if i'm using a preprocessor i won't talk too much about that but i'd highly suggest checking out my course learn sas so those are my tips for optimizing that css code better validate compress preload lighten up those frameworks learn a preprocessor language and check out tools like codekit css optimize and i put a resource in the in the file in day number 28 called shorthand properties teaches you a little bit about using shorthands and a little bit of of how to improve your css coding so thanks for spending a little 15 minutes or so learning a little bit of theory and why you should optimize your css see you tomorrow in day number 29.
