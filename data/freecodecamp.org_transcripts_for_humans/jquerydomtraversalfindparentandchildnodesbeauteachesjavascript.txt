00:00 - hello
00:01 - this video is all about traversing the
00:03 - dom using jquery it's all about trying
00:06 - to find specific html elements based on
00:09 - the relation to other elements you can
00:12 - find parent elements child elements i
00:15 - have this html set up in here to show a
00:18 - lot of different
00:19 - parent elements and child elements you
00:21 - can see how one element is related to
00:23 - another because these green boxes
00:26 - basically show what elements contain
00:28 - other elements i just have css that
00:31 - applies to everything to make this all
00:33 - work here so you can see this div is the
00:36 - parent of this unordered list here
00:39 - and you can see
00:40 - this unordered list is the child of the
00:44 - div here we have a bunch of children of
00:48 - this span also all these elements here
00:52 - in the middle are siblings of each other
00:55 - they're all on the same level you can
00:57 - see that same thing in the html that's
00:59 - how you can tell parents and children
01:01 - okay i'm gonna bring up the javascript
01:03 - here so we can just focus on the jquery
01:05 - we're gonna use i've already added
01:07 - jquery to the project you can check my
01:09 - first video in the series to learn how
01:11 - to do that okay i just pasted in some
01:14 - code here we have the jquery selector to
01:16 - select the the li element and here's
01:19 - here's the new thing we're learning dot
01:21 - parent now we're going to get the parent
01:24 - of the li element and then we're just
01:26 - going to change the css we're going to
01:29 - change the color chocolate and
01:31 - the border is also going to be changed
01:33 - to chocolate i decided to use a tasty
01:35 - color this time so let's run that
01:39 - and you can see the parent of the li
01:41 - element has turned to chocolate so
01:44 - here's the li element and here's the
01:46 - parent the ul element now if i change
01:49 - this to span here
01:51 - i run that
01:52 - the interesting thing about that is
01:54 - there are two spans we have the span
01:56 - here and we have the span here the
01:58 - parent of this man is the li the parent
02:00 - of this span is the other span another
02:03 - thing we can do is instead of using
02:04 - parent do parents plural with an s at
02:07 - the end that's going to get all the
02:09 - parents all the way up to the root
02:11 - element so if i run that
02:14 - you can see now there's a bunch of
02:15 - things even things that we didn't even
02:17 - know about including this other div here
02:20 - have turned to chocolate border
02:22 - now another one we can do to find
02:24 - parents let's find the parent of the li
02:26 - element so instead of parents here we're
02:28 - gonna do parents until
02:30 - so this is going to find all the
02:32 - elements between two so starting at the
02:35 - li element and going to let's do the div
02:39 - element so let's see what happens there
02:41 - okay so it started at the li element
02:44 - it ended at the div element every
02:46 - element in between is just this ul
02:48 - element okay the the children method
02:51 - goes in the opposite direction so
02:53 - instead of the parents until i'm gonna
02:54 - change this to children
02:56 - and we're not gonna put anything in the
02:58 - parentheses here and let's run that and
03:00 - see what happens
03:02 - and as you can see this only is going to
03:04 - traverse a single level down in the dom
03:06 - tree so we're just going to get the span
03:08 - element if there were multiple li
03:10 - elements we would get the children of
03:12 - each of those elements now i'm going to
03:14 - change this to span
03:16 - so now we're going to get the children
03:17 - of the span elements
03:20 - and you can see all of these are the
03:21 - children of the span elements there's a
03:23 - bunch of children this of the span
03:24 - elements so inside the parentheses here
03:27 - we can put specifically which child we
03:29 - want so i'm going to put
03:31 - h2
03:33 - and then run that
03:35 - and now it's only selecting the child of
03:38 - a span element that's an h2 element
03:41 - i'm also going to show you about find
03:43 - so i'm going to start this at ul and
03:46 - we're going to find all children
03:49 - after the ul element that are specific
03:52 - elements in this case i'm going to do
03:55 - span
03:56 - so we're going to start the ul element
03:58 - and then we're going to find all
04:00 - children that are span elements all the
04:02 - way down so let's run that
04:05 - so we found this span and this span and
04:08 - if you want to find all children
04:10 - not just the span elements you can put
04:14 - an asterisk here
04:16 - so it starts with the ul element then it
04:18 - finds all children that are any type of
04:21 - element and make some chocolate
04:23 - okay now we're going to talk about
04:24 - siblings i was telling you earlier that
04:27 - all these ones in the middle are
04:28 - siblings of each other i'm going to put
04:31 - h2 here and i'm going to use the method
04:34 - siblings
04:35 - nothing will be in the parentheses this
04:37 - time
04:38 - and we get all the siblings of the h2
04:40 - element not the h2 element but all the
04:43 - siblings are now chocolate and you may
04:45 - want to just get specific siblings so
04:49 - i'm going to put p
04:51 - for the paragraph tag now we're just
04:53 - getting the siblings of an h2 element
04:55 - that are paragraphs
04:57 - i'm going to delete this here we're
04:59 - going to keep selecting the h2 element
05:01 - but now i'm going to show you the next
05:03 - method
05:04 - so the next just gets the next sibling
05:08 - so we were started on the h2 element and
05:10 - the next sibling is the h3 element
05:13 - and there's also
05:15 - next all
05:18 - so we started the h2 element and then we
05:20 - get all the rest of the elements
05:22 - afterwards that are siblings
05:24 - and then we have next until
05:27 - this time i'm going to start the span
05:29 - element
05:31 - and if i go back into the html you'll
05:34 - see that this first span element has the
05:37 - class child
05:39 - so i'm gonna do span dot child to select
05:43 - just this span element just the child
05:45 - span element and not the parent span
05:48 - element and we're using the next until
05:51 - method next until
05:53 - h3
05:56 - so we start this this span here and we
05:58 - select all the elements between the span
06:00 - and h3 which is just h2
06:03 - if we put a paragraph tag in here
06:07 - then we'll also select the h3 afterwards
06:10 - so i showed you next next all and next
06:12 - until the same things work with prev
06:15 - preval and prev until that just gets the
06:18 - previous element or all the previous
06:21 - elements or a previous until an element
06:24 - so i'll just give you one example of
06:26 - that
06:27 - just the prev if we run that we start
06:29 - this span and the previous element is
06:31 - the paragraph again you can also do prep
06:34 - all preventive okay those are all the
06:36 - main methods for traversing the dom
06:38 - finding parent and child elements check
06:40 - the description for a list of all the
06:43 - the methods we went through thanks for
06:44 - watching my name is beau carnes don't

you can see now there's a bunch of things even things that we didn't even know about including this other div here have turned to chocolate border now another one we can do to find parents let's find the parent of the li element so instead of parents here we're gonna do parents until so this is going to find all the elements between two so starting at the li element and going to let's do the div element so let's see what happens there okay so it started at the li element it ended at the div element every element in between is just this ul element okay the the children method goes in the opposite direction so instead of the parents until i'm gonna change this to children and we're not gonna put anything in the parentheses here and let's run that and see what happens and as you can see this only is going to traverse a single level down in the dom tree so we're just going to get the span element if there were multiple li elements we would get the children of each of those elements

so we're going to start the ul element and then we're going to find all children that are span elements all the way down so let's run that so we found this span and this span and if you want to find all children not just the span elements you can put an asterisk here so it starts with the ul element then it finds all children that are any type of element and make some chocolate okay now we're going to talk about siblings i was telling you earlier that all these ones in the middle are siblings of each other i'm going to put h2 here and i'm going to use the method siblings nothing will be in the parentheses this time and we get all the siblings of the h2 element not the h2 element but all the siblings are now chocolate and you may want to just get specific siblings so i'm going to put p for the paragraph tag now we're just getting the siblings of an h2 element that are paragraphs i'm going to delete this here we're going to keep selecting the h2 element but now i'm going to show you the next method so the next just gets the next sibling so we were started on the h2 element and the next sibling is the h3 element and there's also next all so we started the h2 element and then we get all the rest of the elements afterwards that are siblings and then we have next until this time i'm going to start the span element and if i go back into the html you'll see that this first span element has the class child so i'm gonna do span dot child to select just this span element just the child span element and not the parent span element and we're using the next until method next until h3 so we start this this span here and we select all the elements between the span and h3 which is just h2 if we put a paragraph tag in here then we'll also select the h3 afterwards so i showed you next next all and next until the same things work with prev preval and prev until that just gets the previous element or all the previous elements or a previous until an element so i'll just give you one example of that just the prev if we run that we start this span and the previous element is the paragraph again you can also do prep all preventive okay those are all the main methods for traversing the dom finding parent and child elements check the description for a list of all the the methods we went through thanks for watching my name is beau carnes don't forget to subscribe and
