00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to css3 in
00:02 - 30 days today is day 18 and we're going
00:05 - to be coding up some css3 tooltips let
00:08 - me show you what that looks like right
00:09 - here in the browser we have the final
00:11 - result down here and the tooltip is
00:13 - essentially a little element that just
00:14 - appears in some position around the
00:18 - element to let you know a little bit
00:21 - more information the purpose of a
00:23 - tooltip is not to look fancy but
00:25 - specifically to help the user understand
00:29 - something about what they are
00:30 - interacting with so from a usability
00:32 - standpoint let's say this little pink
00:35 - box i have here
00:37 - is an acronym
00:39 - and you want to be able to let them know
00:41 - what that acronym stands for when you
00:43 - hover over it maybe the tooltip lets
00:45 - them know what it stands for or maybe
00:47 - there is an element a call to action
00:50 - where if you hover over it it lets them
00:51 - know additional information to help them
00:54 - understand how to interact with that
00:56 - element a little bit better there's an
00:57 - endless amount of reasons why you might
00:59 - want a tooltip but the purpose of this
01:01 - lesson is not necessarily to show you
01:03 - the why of the tooltip rather the how to
01:07 - make a tooltip so let's jump in and
01:09 - start making tool tips so in this final
01:11 - result i'm just going to show you what
01:13 - we're going to make we've got this top
01:14 - tool tip this right tool tip bottom tool
01:16 - tip and left tool tip
01:18 - all we're going to do is we're going to
01:19 - coat up these these little elements
01:22 - it's just something to hover over and
01:24 - then we're going to make a global
01:25 - tooltip style and then we're going to
01:27 - start positioning them depending on
01:28 - where you hover all in css that's the
01:30 - exciting part about this a lot of the
01:32 - times tool tips are made using
01:34 - javascript or jquery but in this case
01:36 - just css3 because that's how we roll in
01:39 - css3 in 30 days over here in the code
01:41 - editor we have our 18 tool tips take a
01:44 - moment to go and download that and open
01:47 - up your index and sandbox final.css is
01:50 - always there for your reference as you
01:52 - go along if you mess something up or if
01:54 - you're confused about something that
01:55 - should help you out otherwise let's get
01:58 - started here in the index i'm going to
01:59 - show you what the markup looks like
02:01 - because it is a little bit important
02:03 - because we're going to be styling it so
02:05 - in the sandbox here we have just some
02:07 - divs and the div they all have the class
02:09 - of tool tip and then the position of
02:12 - where it will be so the class is simply
02:14 - top right bottom and left they all have
02:17 - the class of tool tip
02:19 - the other thing is there is a title
02:20 - attribute with some text i've just said
02:22 - to tooltip on top right and so on and so
02:24 - forth and that is really it for the
02:27 - markup
02:28 - in the sandbox we're going to get
02:29 - started and we're going to style
02:31 - our tool tip element itself so the the
02:35 - the target that we want to hover over so
02:37 - we're going to
02:39 - select tool tip and then we're just
02:40 - going to say position relative this is
02:42 - important because we're going to be
02:44 - positioning that tool tip itself so
02:46 - right now we're positioning the parent
02:48 - element that we call tooltip but it has
02:51 - to have a position of relative or
02:53 - absolute whichever one you choose in
02:54 - this case we're going to use relative so
02:56 - it doesn't move around in weird places
02:59 - and
03:00 - that's simply so that when we position
03:02 - the tooltip itself using the before and
03:06 - after
03:08 - virtual elements we need to have it stay
03:10 - contained within its parent so position
03:13 - relative is very important in this case
03:15 - height 60 pixels again this is just the
03:18 - target we're going to hover over i'm
03:19 - just jamming here 250 pixels background
03:22 - we're going to use that
03:23 - the pink color that branded pink that's
03:27 - f2395a whatever color you want it really
03:29 - doesn't matter this isn't functionality
03:31 - this is just some
03:33 - this is just vanity styles here text
03:35 - align center we're going to line height
03:37 - the text in the center of it
03:39 - to 60 pixels which is going to be the
03:41 - same as the height so it's vertically
03:42 - aligned as well as center aligned
03:44 - because of text align center font size
03:46 - something large and readable 18 pixels
03:49 - margin zero auto and that's how you
03:51 - style a target element boom just like
03:53 - that
03:55 - nice okay let's go back to the
03:58 - uh
04:00 - the sandbox here
04:02 - and let's get coding up the tool tip
04:04 - itself so we're going to just say tool
04:06 - tip but we're going to actually select
04:07 - the before pseudo element this whole
04:10 - time i've been calling them virtual
04:11 - elements
04:13 - i think i made that up
04:14 - maybe i didn't
04:16 - but the idea is that it is a
04:19 - pseudo element it's not a real element
04:21 - it's kind of an element that doesn't
04:23 - really appear unless you make it do
04:24 - something so it's just a funky little uh
04:26 - css trick again i've been calling them
04:29 - virtual elements this this whole time
04:31 - and i think i made that up but we still
04:33 - got the job done right brad
04:35 - right brad
04:37 - position we're going to position
04:38 - absolute because we want to move that
04:40 - around freely outside of the flow we
04:43 - don't really want position relative to
04:45 - be messing with it so position
04:46 - absolute's going to give us more
04:47 - flexibility
04:49 - z index 2 just a little bit above the
04:52 - default which tool tip will be at zero
04:54 - and then this one will bring it up just
04:56 - a little bit
04:57 - we don't want it to be behind its parent
04:58 - element display
05:00 - none by default width 200 pixels padding
05:04 - 10 pixels
05:05 - so something nice and simple font size
05:07 - i'm going to go 0.8 that's eighty
05:09 - percent of the
05:10 - parent elements font size which is
05:12 - eighteen pixels so eighty percent of the
05:13 - uh eighty percent of that whatever
05:16 - whatever that number is
05:18 - line height one point four m
05:20 - let's try that and border radius
05:24 - we're going to say 5 pixels slightly
05:26 - rounded
05:28 - background color we're going to go with
05:30 - an rgba something you could see through
05:32 - simply a 0 0 0 and 0.8
05:36 - so it's black but 80 alpha channel so a
05:39 - little bit transparent
05:41 - color white that's the text the content
05:44 - this is cool content used with the
05:46 - before and after pseudo elements to
05:47 - generate content specific text within an
05:51 - element so we've been using this a lot
05:53 - uh in this way but they're actually
05:55 - gonna this means you can actually put
05:57 - text within the element we're just
05:59 - putting an empty string because uh it
06:02 - allows that after element to appear so
06:03 - we still need to have content within the
06:05 - pseudo-element but we're actually going
06:06 - to have it display real content this
06:08 - time not just an empty string so we're
06:11 - just going to do something fun here so
06:12 - instead of an empty string we're
06:14 - actually going to use
06:15 - attribute value
06:17 - that says attribute value for the
06:18 - content property so this is specific a
06:21 - specific value for this property which
06:24 - means we have access to
06:27 - within this parentheses
06:29 - a specific attribute within the html so
06:31 - we want to grab the title that title we
06:34 - specifically put in the html will say
06:36 - tooltip on the right tooltip on the
06:38 - bottom so on and so forth so that is
06:39 - cool dynamic it's not just hard-coded so
06:42 - this will depend on whatever the title
06:44 - is of that element really exciting stuff
06:47 - i'm so pumped okay
06:50 - we're gonna now select tool tip
06:52 - after pseudo element
06:56 - and now before we get move forward let's
06:59 - actually just see if this did anything
07:01 - so i'm going to move over to the browser
07:03 - and it doesn't do anything because we
07:05 - haven't
07:06 - done any styles upon hover so we're
07:08 - going to work on that
07:10 - let me actually let's just do that now
07:12 - so we can
07:13 - so we can make it appear so tool tip
07:16 - hover
07:17 - and then the before so how that works is
07:20 - the tool tip
07:21 - uh the tooltip element when we hover
07:23 - over the tooltip element
07:24 - do something with the before
07:26 - pseudo element so it's a kind of an
07:28 - interesting little selector so display
07:31 - inline block
07:33 - watch this
07:34 - save that
07:35 - now when i hover
07:37 - nothing happens exactly what i wanted
07:40 - now you might be wondering why that
07:41 - little thing pops up when you say that's
07:43 - just the title attribute appearing by
07:45 - default the browser's native uh
07:47 - functionality it shows uh the title just
07:50 - for accessibility but we actually want
07:51 - to make our own so back to the original
07:53 - problem we don't see it i'm thinking
07:55 - that's because
07:57 - okay super silly just realized this i
07:59 - was uh styling here's the problem maybe
08:02 - you noticed this and you were just
08:04 - shaking your head wondering when i was
08:05 - gonna catch it i styled tool tip after
08:07 - pseudo element i meant to style these
08:09 - tool tip before pseudo element and then
08:12 - down here i set on hover show the before
08:14 - element which we haven't done anything
08:16 - with so let's change that to before
08:20 - and top i'm going to take that out
08:22 - because i'm actually going to use that
08:24 - save that and then on hover that should
08:26 - work let's see what happens here
08:28 - there it is okay so the tooltip on top
08:32 - appears there it's at the very it's
08:34 - somewhere in the top right i don't
08:36 - really know what's going on with its
08:37 - position
08:38 - so we need to fix that plus we need to
08:40 - do one little thing i want to show a
08:42 - little arrow pointing towards
08:45 - the element itself so down here in the
08:47 - final example i want it to look like
08:49 - that it has a little arrow so i'm going
08:51 - to create that little arrow
08:53 - with the after pseudo element which i
08:56 - was accidentally styling this whole time
08:59 - so that's going to be like this position
09:02 - absolute z index we're going to say 1
09:04 - it's going to be above the parent but
09:06 - behind the
09:09 - little tool tip itself
09:10 - and then i'm going to say display none
09:12 - again by default we don't want to see it
09:14 - width 0
09:15 - height 0 and this is because we're going
09:17 - to make it we're going to make a
09:18 - triangle out of a border like we did
09:20 - with pac-man just recently here so we're
09:23 - going to say border 5 pixels solid
09:25 - transparent so we don't see any of the
09:27 - border
09:28 - and then a little bit later here i'm
09:29 - going to create and display one side of
09:32 - it so let's just leave it at that and
09:34 - then we're gonna say content empty
09:36 - string so that
09:37 - will create an element that we still
09:40 - won't see and we're gonna do something
09:41 - with in a sec so let's position that
09:45 - let's um
09:46 - let's say
09:49 - we're gonna go bottom
09:51 - zero no one hundred percent so the very
09:53 - bottom of the element
09:56 - left
09:57 - fifty percent
09:59 - border
10:01 - top color
10:02 - let's do the same color as the tooltip 0
10:05 - 0 0 0.5 0.8
10:10 - rgba let's say that and see what just
10:12 - happened
10:14 - okay so i don't see it
10:16 - and that is because
10:18 - we're actually on hover up here where
10:21 - are we right here
10:23 - we need to make the after pseudo element
10:26 - appear on hover as well tool tip hover
10:28 - after
10:30 - so save that but i'm going to put this
10:33 - style
10:37 - after
10:39 - that hover
10:41 - simply because it's cascading i don't
10:42 - want the this style to be before this
10:45 - just in case there's some sort of
10:46 - problem okay so something is happening
10:48 - here so when i hover now you can see the
10:50 - arrow it's the right shape shape and
10:52 - size but it's in the wrong
10:54 - spot so we need to move that in the
10:56 - right spot so what do we got to do to do
11:00 - that
11:01 - it has to be in the center of this
11:03 - element
11:04 - let's start by centering the tool tip
11:06 - itself because it's obviously in the
11:08 - wrong spot it needs to be
11:09 - centered and then above the element so
11:12 - let's go ahead and do that let's go back
11:14 - to the tool tip
11:17 - top before
11:20 - and what we're going to do
11:22 - is we're going to position it now and so
11:25 - we're going to say bottom
11:27 - now if i just said bottom 100
11:29 - what's going to happen it's going to
11:30 - move it up but i want to add another 5
11:33 - pixels to that so because the
11:36 - the
11:38 - the size of that arrow is 5 pixels
11:40 - because we said in our border 5 pixels
11:44 - so we want it to be 100 from the bottom
11:48 - but then another 5 pixels now we can't
11:51 - find out that we can't create that with
11:53 - a percentage
11:55 - but i also want to have a dynamic
11:57 - tool tip position from the bottom
11:59 - because that element could be any size
12:01 - if i want to add a tooltip to any
12:03 - element not just a specific
12:05 - hard-coded height so it needs to be 100
12:07 - from the bottom but it needs to have an
12:09 - additional five pixels and the way we
12:11 - can
12:12 - combine
12:13 - a percentage and a pixel
12:15 - value is through the calc css function
12:18 - so check this out
12:21 - let's go back to our css
12:23 - i'm going to wrap this in the calc
12:25 - function
12:27 - like this
12:28 - but i'm going to say plus
12:31 - 5 pixels that allows us to combine
12:34 - different values different measurements
12:36 - now watch this
12:38 - 100 plus 5 pixels that's amazing how
12:42 - cool is that so now we need to fix that
12:45 - needs to move it over so let me let me
12:47 - do another thing here we're going to
12:50 - we got to move it left let's say
12:55 - left 50
12:57 - save that let's see what happens okay so
12:58 - now we're 50 over now we're starting to
13:00 - look good 50 over from the left side of
13:02 - the parent element as you can see as
13:05 - well as the little arrow is it's in the
13:07 - bottom left-hand corner of the tooltip
13:09 - but we need to fix that we need to move
13:11 - it back over so
13:13 - how we do that is through a we could
13:16 - just simply say margin left you know
13:19 - you know
13:20 - negative whatever the width is
13:22 - of the element
13:24 - but i want to use
13:26 - transform
13:28 - the reason why is because
13:30 - this is kind of an animated element it's
13:34 - kind of appearing uh you know through a
13:36 - fade and i just want to wanted to use
13:38 - this as an example i could just use the
13:40 - margin left or positioning but here's
13:43 - the deal there i found a really cool
13:44 - article about the
13:47 - specifically what i'm going to do is
13:48 - this and i'll tell you exactly why so
13:50 - translate
13:51 - x
13:52 - so translate the value for the transform
13:54 - property on the x axis
13:57 - which means
13:59 - horizontally so i'm going to say
14:01 - negative 50 now let me show you what it
14:04 - happens and then we're going to go from
14:06 - there so now we're perfectly in the
14:08 - center
14:09 - so i moved it negative 50 of its width
14:12 - over so that it is perfectly in the
14:14 - center the reason why i used transform
14:17 - translate is because this article
14:20 - is a great article
14:22 - i have a link in the final code in the
14:24 - in this in line 58 of the final css with
14:27 - the link to this article it's basically
14:29 - i wanted to know okay why would you want
14:31 - to use translate
14:34 - versus an absolute position or
14:36 - you know using a margin where you can
14:38 - you know negative
14:40 - the amount so it's centered which we've
14:42 - done before
14:44 - well he basically says
14:46 - don't confuse positioning with design
14:48 - emotion so
14:50 - here's an example when you use an
14:52 - element that has an absolute position or
14:53 - a margin you know
14:56 - negative pixel position it's going the
14:58 - browser is going to render that
14:59 - animation if you're moving it at all
15:01 - pixel by pixel so this is cool so in the
15:04 - animation if you were to view the source
15:06 - code and you animated it into that
15:08 - position
15:09 - it's going to go
15:11 - pixel it's going to 2 pixels 3 pixels 4
15:13 - pixels until it goes from whatever
15:15 - whatever starting pixel to the end pixel
15:18 - pixel by pixel so technically that's
15:20 - pretty choppy especially if you had a
15:21 - really good um
15:24 - retina screen where you can see
15:27 - the little fine details but
15:30 - that's not the best practice how do you
15:32 - do it so it's more smooth so it renders
15:34 - a bit more smooth well you use translate
15:38 - the transform translate where the
15:40 - browser does something like this it
15:41 - renders that animation way smoother so
15:43 - it goes
15:44 - in increments so you can see it goes
15:46 - from the starting of zero let's say and
15:48 - the final the final pixel that you end
15:51 - on is one pixel it doesn't just go zero
15:53 - to one it goes
15:55 - 0.1.2.3.4.5 all the way up to your final
15:57 - position
15:58 - so that it's a really smooth animation
16:01 - so
16:02 - the way arthur i believe is the author
16:04 - here he says don't confuse positioning
16:07 - so i'm moving an element in a specific
16:09 - and static and hard-coded place
16:12 - with design emotion
16:14 - so possibly i'm thinking here maybe our
16:17 - pac-man instead of using uh you know the
16:20 - moving the pixels across the screen
16:22 - maybe i would have used transform
16:24 - translate x
16:26 - to move him across the screen that might
16:28 - be something that you might want to
16:29 - revisit to see if we can improve that
16:31 - instead of using
16:32 - absolute positioning
16:34 - using transform translate
16:36 - so my little rant on
16:38 - why
16:39 - you would use transform translate i'm
16:42 - simply positioning it in an area but
16:44 - because
16:45 - it's gonna be fading in and because you
16:47 - could have it slide up or slide down
16:50 - into position using the transform
16:52 - property is a nicer way of handling its
16:56 - position because it's a bit more dynamic
16:58 - hopefully that makes sense and i didn't
17:00 - go off on a tangent for no reason
17:01 - whatsoever okay so
17:05 - now we've got our tool tip in the right
17:07 - position we want that
17:10 - little arrow to be in the right position
17:12 - so
17:12 - let's find the tooltip after
17:17 - uh and just for consistency i'm gonna
17:19 - move this hover
17:21 - above these styles
17:26 - like so
17:27 - and then down here we're gonna start
17:29 - styling the after so what happens
17:32 - uh let me see i'm going to move down a
17:34 - couple
17:34 - and we said bottom 100 percent and left
17:38 - 50
17:39 - so that's good but what we actually need
17:41 - to do now is
17:42 - if you can see it needs to be centered
17:45 - properly it's not actually in the center
17:46 - of the tooltip so let's try that
17:49 - transform
17:52 - translate x again and then say negative
17:54 - 50 and i'll see what it does to it
17:57 - so now it is actually perfectly centered
17:59 - this is the same width on the left as it
18:01 - is on the right
18:02 - perfect but it's not below
18:05 - the tooltip we want to be able to see
18:06 - that and that's because
18:08 - let's see if i can do this this is the
18:10 - top border of an element
18:12 - of a five pixel border
18:15 - and so there are three other sides that
18:17 - you can't see so we just need to make
18:18 - the border bottom with zero
18:22 - so that should jump that whole element
18:24 - down so let's try that so we're going to
18:26 - say border bottom width
18:29 - 0. now i could have just used position
18:31 - bottom 100 calc and then extra 5 pixels
18:35 - but i just want to make it easy instead
18:36 - of doing anything else and just say
18:38 - border bottom with 0. so now the border
18:40 - top width is 5 pixels the border bottom
18:42 - width is nothing so that should collapse
18:44 - it down below the tool tip let's see
18:50 - just like i said it would do so that now
18:52 - means that the border bottom of that
18:54 - element is zero you can't it's nothing
18:56 - there taking up space and it jumps that
18:58 - arrow down so that it's just
19:01 - touching the tooltip on the top so there
19:03 - is our top
19:04 - tool tip
19:05 - that's
19:06 - it for that that style right there so
19:08 - now all of them have these styles
19:13 - so that's a little bit of a problem
19:15 - because
19:16 - they need to be a bit more specific so
19:18 - the styles i just styled were for all
19:20 - the tool tips so maybe we'll go back
19:21 - into our css here
19:25 - and what we're going to do is revisit
19:27 - here so the tooltip hover it's going to
19:29 - display all the tool tips on hover we
19:31 - want that but now what we want
19:36 - for
19:38 - for the tool tip top so we want all the
19:41 - tool tips to have these styles
19:43 - but this style is specific to the tool
19:45 - tip top so i'm gonna i'm gonna
19:48 - cut that out
19:49 - and what i'm gonna do
19:52 - is this so i'm going to actually go
19:54 - down to the bottom
19:56 - and i'm going to say
19:57 - tool tip and then i'm going to combine
19:59 - that with the class of top
20:01 - and then
20:03 - the after
20:04 - pseudo element
20:06 - i believe it was before actually was the
20:10 - style we were going for yes so that is
20:12 - the tooltip itself the position of the
20:14 - top tool tip save that
20:16 - okay perfect so now these ones are
20:18 - broken because i'm not selecting them
20:20 - anymore that is more of what we wanted
20:22 - but we also did the after the position
20:25 - of that arrow is wrong so we need to
20:27 - specifically take yes so we're going to
20:29 - take all these styles because that's
20:31 - specific to where it's going to be
20:33 - positioned so now this is just styling
20:35 - all the all of those elements
20:37 - as a as in terms of its look and feel
20:39 - but the position of it we want to be
20:41 - very specific so now down here
20:44 - i'm going to say
20:45 - tool tip
20:47 - top and then the after pseudo element i
20:49 - add these styles so now let's try that
20:53 - tooltip top works great these ones are
20:55 - broken beautiful okay so a quick review
20:59 - we have the tooltip
21:01 - global style just for that pink uh
21:03 - element
21:04 - we have the
21:06 - when you hover the before and after
21:08 - elements will appear
21:10 - um we'll get a display of inline block
21:13 - the default tool tip before styles in
21:15 - fact why don't we just move these up
21:19 - reorganizing my code a little bit here
21:21 - so tool tip and then toolpit tooltip
21:24 - after
21:25 - and tilt it before okay so we've got
21:27 - those three things
21:29 - and then we have tool tip hover before
21:31 - and after then we have tool tip top
21:34 - before
21:35 - that's position to get that
21:37 - in the top center position above the the
21:41 - pink element and then tool to top after
21:42 - which is the little arrow in the bottom
21:44 - in the center that is good so moving on
21:47 - that was the
21:48 - was the bulk of the work i think
21:50 - because now what we're going to be doing
21:52 - is just positioning
21:54 - the
21:56 - we already styled up the tool tip now we
21:58 - just need to position them so that
21:59 - whoops so that the tooltip is on the
22:02 - other right bottom or left and the
22:04 - arrows are in the
22:05 - their respective positions
22:08 - so rolling up our sleeves here we're
22:10 - going to get started
22:12 - let's go down here below tooltip top
22:13 - after give a little bit of space and now
22:16 - what we're going to do is we're going to
22:16 - be styling the tool tip
22:19 - let's do the one on the
22:22 - the right that's the next one
22:25 - tool tip
22:26 - right so those are connected that's a
22:28 - very specific selector i'm selecting the
22:30 - classic tool tip that also has the class
22:32 - of right
22:33 - and
22:34 - before pseudo element now we're going to
22:37 - do is we're going to say top
22:39 - 50
22:40 - because it needs to be in the center
22:43 - of the element so if we look over here
22:45 - we need that to be
22:46 - centered in
22:47 - vertically
22:49 - so let's go back here and we're going to
22:50 - say
22:52 - left
22:53 - here's what we're going to do so we're
22:54 - going to say left we're going to go calc
22:56 - again the calc function 100 from the
22:59 - left now let's see what's going on here
23:02 - if i save that check it out it's going
23:04 - to be all the way over there
23:06 - the problem here is a couple things
23:09 - it's um we need to have some space
23:12 - for the arrow
23:13 - on that
23:14 - in between the two elements so we're
23:16 - gonna do the calc 100
23:18 - plus five pixels that will give us that
23:20 - space
23:21 - perfect and the other problem is
23:24 - the
23:25 - the
23:26 - vertical on the y axis
23:29 - the that tool tip on the right is just
23:31 - centered from the top we need to be
23:33 - centered from the
23:35 - the middle of the element that makes
23:36 - sense so we're also going to go
23:39 - transform
23:41 - translate y so it's on the y axis
23:44 - negative fifty percent save that check
23:46 - it out so now we're in the right spot
23:49 - now we need to get that arrow
23:51 - and we need to make that appear properly
23:53 - so now we're going to style tooltip
23:56 - with the class of right and the after
23:59 - pseudo element
24:02 - we're going to say border
24:04 - right
24:05 - color
24:07 - whoops
24:09 - is
24:10 - rgba
24:12 - i don't want to type all this out so i'm
24:13 - going to copy that the rgb
24:16 - zero point ba000.8
24:18 - and then the border
24:21 - uh we're gonna say top
24:23 - fifty percent so we want it to be down
24:25 - fifty percent and then left one hundred
24:27 - percent so
24:29 - uh let's let's see what that does okay
24:31 - so from the left it's 100
24:33 - because the parent element is here
24:35 - so left 100 i believe that's the case
24:38 - yep
24:39 - well let's see if i just left zero we'll
24:41 - see what happens
24:43 - yeah so see how it's over here
24:45 - now what the other thing is do you see
24:47 - how there's a little bit of space how
24:48 - it's not actually connected to the left
24:49 - side of the element that's because the
24:51 - other three sides of the border one
24:53 - two
24:54 - and three are invisible they're
24:56 - transparent but the width is still there
24:58 - so i want the left width of the border
25:00 - to be zero
25:02 - so let's do that right now we're going
25:03 - to say
25:04 - border left
25:06 - width
25:08 - zero
25:09 - now check it out now we're right at this
25:12 - the left side now we need to position
25:14 - that to be left 100 like we're
25:16 - originally doing
25:18 - but the problem here is it's not
25:20 - actually aligned in the center of that
25:22 - tool tip and we're going to fix that
25:25 - with the transform property transform
25:29 - and we're going to say translate
25:31 - y and you guessed it negative 50
25:35 - and that is going to
25:37 - do the trick i believe
25:39 - there it is so the tooltip on the right
25:41 - is done so now we should be able to zip
25:43 - through that was only about three
25:44 - minutes to code that up now our bottom
25:46 - and left should be super
25:48 - easy
25:49 - so let's uh jump down to our bottom so
25:52 - now
25:53 - a little bit of space i'm just gonna
25:54 - space these out a little bit
25:56 - so it's easier to find them
25:58 - good organization so now we're going to
25:59 - style up that bottom so we're going to
26:00 - go tool tip that also has the class of
26:03 - bottom
26:04 - and the before pseudo element the top
26:08 - we're going to need to let's see look at
26:10 - here so in the bottom it needs to be 100
26:12 - down from the top
26:14 - so top will be
26:16 - calc we're going to do calc again 100
26:19 - plus the 5 pixels for that little arrow
26:25 - now we're going to do is we're going to
26:26 - go left 50 because we want to be to be
26:29 - centered
26:30 - but that's going to create a problem
26:31 - again check it out it's going to be left
26:33 - from the left side we need to to take
26:35 - off half of the of the width so it's
26:37 - center so we're going to use that
26:39 - transform
26:41 - and we're going to use uh
26:43 - translate on the x-axis translate x and
26:46 - then that's going to be negative 50
26:49 - percent save that that should get us in
26:52 - the center looking very nice now we just
26:55 - need to position
26:56 - that
26:57 - after
26:58 - pseudo-element tooltip bottom after okay
27:02 - top 100
27:04 - left fifty percent we're gonna go border
27:08 - bottom color because we want it to
27:10 - appear now rgba zero zero zero zero
27:12 - point eight
27:14 - save that let's see what we got
27:16 - so i can see it there it's right there
27:19 - but it's not centered in the middle of
27:21 - the tooltip and it needs to be up 5
27:22 - pixels so maybe you guessed it border
27:26 - top
27:26 - width 0
27:28 - and transform
27:30 - translate x negative 50 percent save
27:35 - that refresh
27:37 - tooltip on the bottom that's looking
27:38 - nice and last but not least tool tip
27:42 - on the left so we're going to give a
27:43 - little bit of space in between here
27:45 - we're going to say tooltip
27:47 - also with the class of left and the
27:49 - before pseudo-element this is kind of
27:51 - like
27:51 - repetition now at this point you might
27:53 - even be able to do this by yourself i
27:55 - challenge you in fact to pause the video
27:58 - what keep me in this frame right here
28:02 - that one and code this one up yourself
28:05 - and then hit play see if you got it
28:07 - right so here we are you've paused the
28:10 - video
28:11 - and
28:12 - uh you've coded it up and you're gonna
28:13 - see if you got this right now keep in
28:16 - mind there's multiple ways of doing
28:18 - getting to the same end result but
28:21 - here's how i'm going to code it up and
28:22 - let's see how close you were i'm going
28:24 - to say top 50
28:26 - right it needs to be 100 but i need to
28:28 - calculate that with a pixel width so 100
28:32 - from the right plus
28:34 - five pixels to account for that little
28:36 - arrow
28:37 - transform we're going to trans translate
28:39 - that on the y-axis
28:42 - and we're gonna go negative fifty
28:44 - percent let's check it out
28:46 - that's looking nice and now here we go
28:49 - we're just gonna simply say
28:50 - tooltip
28:53 - uh with the class of left and after
28:55 - we're gonna say top 50
28:58 - left nope that's not right right 100 now
29:01 - we're gonna go border left color because
29:03 - we want the left arrow to appear
29:06 - and we're gonna say border
29:09 - right
29:10 - width zero so there's no
29:12 - conflict with the size there transform
29:15 - translate on the
29:18 - y-axis it's gonna be negative fifty
29:20 - percent save that boom i think we just
29:23 - nailed it so if that's what your code
29:25 - looks like or something like that
29:27 - good job you got the hang of it that's
29:29 - it for tool tips we got tool tip on the
29:31 - top right bottom and left
29:34 - purely css3
29:36 - that's awesome it's really lightweight
29:38 - when you do that in css3 we did a couple
29:40 - new things we played around with the
29:41 - transform property which we learned a
29:42 - little bit about why you might want to
29:44 - do that particularly with animations a
29:46 - little challenge for you here if you
29:48 - want because right now these tooltips
29:49 - are just appearing on hover
29:53 - now we've played around with some
29:54 - animations thus far in this css3 in 30
29:57 - days and we
29:59 - uh you should know or maybe you should
30:01 - be able to figure out how to when you
30:03 - hover make the tooltips
30:05 - fade in or maybe
30:07 - you know
30:08 - slide in slide down or slide over play
30:10 - around with it and see what you come up
30:12 - with i challenge you to make these
30:14 - tooltips a little bit more animated and
30:16 - keep in mind the transform and translate
30:19 - style that we learned about positioning
30:21 - and moving things using that where it
30:23 - incrementally moves into the position
30:25 - rather than uses a hard-coded position
30:28 - absolutely positioned property where
30:31 - it's only
30:32 - clunking over pixel by pixel
30:34 - keep that in mind but a simple challenge
30:36 - for you is to make these
30:38 - tooltips fade in on hover and play with
30:41 - it from there i hope you enjoyed today's
30:43 - lesson hope it gave you a few ideas for
30:44 - your own website's applications and all
30:47 - of that have a good day i'll see you
30:49 - tomorrow and day number
30:51 - 19. diese nueve adios

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day 18 and we're going to be coding up some css3 tooltips let me show you what that looks like right here in the browser we have the final result down here and the tooltip is essentially a little element that just appears in some position around the element to let you know a little bit more information the purpose of a tooltip is not to look fancy but specifically to help the user understand something about what they are interacting with so from a usability standpoint let's say this little pink box i have here is an acronym and you want to be able to let them know what that acronym stands for when you hover over it maybe the tooltip lets them know what it stands for or maybe there is an element a call to action where if you hover over it it lets them know additional information to help them understand how to interact with that element a little bit better there's an endless amount of reasons why you might want a tooltip but the purpose of this lesson is not necessarily to show you the why of the tooltip rather the how to make a tooltip so let's jump in and start making tool tips so in this final result i'm just going to show you what we're going to make we've got this top tool tip this right tool tip bottom tool tip and left tool tip all we're going to do is we're going to coat up these these little elements it's just something to hover over and then we're going to make a global tooltip style and then we're going to start positioning them depending on where you hover all in css that's the exciting part about this a lot of the times tool tips are made using javascript or jquery but in this case just css3 because that's how we roll in css3 in 30 days over here in the code editor we have our 18 tool tips take a moment to go and download that and open up your index and sandbox final.css is always there for your reference as you go along if you mess something up or if you're confused about something that should help you out otherwise let's get started here in the index i'm going to show you what the markup looks like because it is a little bit important because we're going to be styling it so in the sandbox here we have just some divs and the div they all have the class of tool tip and then the position of where it will be so the class is simply top right bottom and left they all have the class of tool tip the other thing is there is a title attribute with some text i've just said to tooltip on top right and so on and so forth and that is really it for the markup in the sandbox we're going to get started and we're going to style our tool tip element itself so the the the target that we want to hover over so we're going to select tool tip and then we're just going to say position relative this is important because we're going to be positioning that tool tip itself so right now we're positioning the parent element that we call tooltip but it has to have a position of relative or absolute whichever one you choose in this case we're going to use relative so it doesn't move around in weird places and that's simply so that when we position the tooltip itself using the before and after virtual elements we need to have it stay contained within its parent so position relative is very important in this case height 60 pixels again this is just the target we're going to hover over i'm just jamming here 250 pixels background we're going to use that the pink color that branded pink that's f2395a whatever color you want it really doesn't matter this isn't functionality this is just some this is just vanity styles here text align center we're going to line height the text in the center of it to 60 pixels which is going to be the same as the height so it's vertically aligned as well as center aligned because of text align center font size something large and readable 18 pixels margin zero auto and that's how you style a target element boom just like that nice okay let's go back to the uh the sandbox here and let's get coding up the tool tip itself so we're going to just say tool tip but we're going to actually select the before pseudo element this whole time i've been calling them virtual elements i think i made that up maybe i didn't but the idea is that it is a pseudo element it's not a real element it's kind of an element that doesn't really appear unless you make it do something so it's just a funky little uh css trick again i've been calling them virtual elements this this whole time and i think i made that up but we still got the job done right brad right brad position we're going to position absolute because we want to move that around freely outside of the flow we don't really want position relative to be messing with it so position absolute's going to give us more flexibility z index 2 just a little bit above the default which tool tip will be at zero and then this one will bring it up just a little bit we don't want it to be behind its parent element display none by default width 200 pixels padding 10 pixels so something nice and simple font size i'm going to go 0.8 that's eighty percent of the parent elements font size which is eighteen pixels so eighty percent of the uh eighty percent of that whatever whatever that number is line height one point four m let's try that and border radius we're going to say 5 pixels slightly rounded background color we're going to go with an rgba something you could see through simply a 0 0 0 and 0.8 so it's black but 80 alpha channel so a little bit transparent color white that's the text the content this is cool content used with the before and after pseudo elements to generate content specific text within an element so we've been using this a lot uh in this way but they're actually gonna this means you can actually put text within the element we're just putting an empty string because uh it allows that after element to appear so we still need to have content within the pseudoelement but we're actually going to have it display real content this time not just an empty string so we're just going to do something fun here so instead of an empty string we're actually going to use attribute value that says attribute value for the content property so this is specific a specific value for this property which means we have access to within this parentheses a specific attribute within the html so we want to grab the title that title we specifically put in the html will say tooltip on the right tooltip on the bottom so on and so forth so that is cool dynamic it's not just hardcoded so this will depend on whatever the title is of that element really exciting stuff i'm so pumped okay we're gonna now select tool tip after pseudo element and now before we get move forward let's actually just see if this did anything so i'm going to move over to the browser and it doesn't do anything because we haven't done any styles upon hover so we're going to work on that let me actually let's just do that now so we can so we can make it appear so tool tip hover and then the before so how that works is the tool tip uh the tooltip element when we hover over the tooltip element do something with the before pseudo element so it's a kind of an interesting little selector so display inline block watch this save that now when i hover nothing happens exactly what i wanted now you might be wondering why that little thing pops up when you say that's just the title attribute appearing by default the browser's native uh functionality it shows uh the title just for accessibility but we actually want to make our own so back to the original problem we don't see it i'm thinking that's because okay super silly just realized this i was uh styling here's the problem maybe you noticed this and you were just shaking your head wondering when i was gonna catch it i styled tool tip after pseudo element i meant to style these tool tip before pseudo element and then down here i set on hover show the before element which we haven't done anything with so let's change that to before and top i'm going to take that out because i'm actually going to use that save that and then on hover that should work let's see what happens here there it is okay so the tooltip on top appears there it's at the very it's somewhere in the top right i don't really know what's going on with its position so we need to fix that plus we need to do one little thing i want to show a little arrow pointing towards the element itself so down here in the final example i want it to look like that it has a little arrow so i'm going to create that little arrow with the after pseudo element which i was accidentally styling this whole time so that's going to be like this position absolute z index we're going to say 1 it's going to be above the parent but behind the little tool tip itself and then i'm going to say display none again by default we don't want to see it width 0 height 0 and this is because we're going to make it we're going to make a triangle out of a border like we did with pacman just recently here so we're going to say border 5 pixels solid transparent so we don't see any of the border and then a little bit later here i'm going to create and display one side of it so let's just leave it at that and then we're gonna say content empty string so that will create an element that we still won't see and we're gonna do something with in a sec so let's position that let's um let's say we're gonna go bottom zero no one hundred percent so the very bottom of the element left fifty percent border top color let's do the same color as the tooltip 0 0 0 0.5 0.8 rgba let's say that and see what just happened okay so i don't see it and that is because we're actually on hover up here where are we right here we need to make the after pseudo element appear on hover as well tool tip hover after so save that but i'm going to put this style after that hover simply because it's cascading i don't want the this style to be before this just in case there's some sort of problem okay so something is happening here so when i hover now you can see the arrow it's the right shape shape and size but it's in the wrong spot so we need to move that in the right spot so what do we got to do to do that it has to be in the center of this element let's start by centering the tool tip itself because it's obviously in the wrong spot it needs to be centered and then above the element so let's go ahead and do that let's go back to the tool tip top before and what we're going to do is we're going to position it now and so we're going to say bottom now if i just said bottom 100 what's going to happen it's going to move it up but i want to add another 5 pixels to that so because the the the size of that arrow is 5 pixels because we said in our border 5 pixels so we want it to be 100 from the bottom but then another 5 pixels now we can't find out that we can't create that with a percentage but i also want to have a dynamic tool tip position from the bottom because that element could be any size if i want to add a tooltip to any element not just a specific hardcoded height so it needs to be 100 from the bottom but it needs to have an additional five pixels and the way we can combine a percentage and a pixel value is through the calc css function so check this out let's go back to our css i'm going to wrap this in the calc function like this but i'm going to say plus 5 pixels that allows us to combine different values different measurements now watch this 100 plus 5 pixels that's amazing how cool is that so now we need to fix that needs to move it over so let me let me do another thing here we're going to we got to move it left let's say left 50 save that let's see what happens okay so now we're 50 over now we're starting to look good 50 over from the left side of the parent element as you can see as well as the little arrow is it's in the bottom lefthand corner of the tooltip but we need to fix that we need to move it back over so how we do that is through a we could just simply say margin left you know you know negative whatever the width is of the element but i want to use transform the reason why is because this is kind of an animated element it's kind of appearing uh you know through a fade and i just want to wanted to use this as an example i could just use the margin left or positioning but here's the deal there i found a really cool article about the specifically what i'm going to do is this and i'll tell you exactly why so translate x so translate the value for the transform property on the x axis which means horizontally so i'm going to say negative 50 now let me show you what it happens and then we're going to go from there so now we're perfectly in the center so i moved it negative 50 of its width over so that it is perfectly in the center the reason why i used transform translate is because this article is a great article i have a link in the final code in the in this in line 58 of the final css with the link to this article it's basically i wanted to know okay why would you want to use translate versus an absolute position or you know using a margin where you can you know negative the amount so it's centered which we've done before well he basically says don't confuse positioning with design emotion so here's an example when you use an element that has an absolute position or a margin you know negative pixel position it's going the browser is going to render that animation if you're moving it at all pixel by pixel so this is cool so in the animation if you were to view the source code and you animated it into that position it's going to go pixel it's going to 2 pixels 3 pixels 4 pixels until it goes from whatever whatever starting pixel to the end pixel pixel by pixel so technically that's pretty choppy especially if you had a really good um retina screen where you can see the little fine details but that's not the best practice how do you do it so it's more smooth so it renders a bit more smooth well you use translate the transform translate where the browser does something like this it renders that animation way smoother so it goes in increments so you can see it goes from the starting of zero let's say and the final the final pixel that you end on is one pixel it doesn't just go zero to one it goes 0.1.2.3.4.5 all the way up to your final position so that it's a really smooth animation so the way arthur i believe is the author here he says don't confuse positioning so i'm moving an element in a specific and static and hardcoded place with design emotion so possibly i'm thinking here maybe our pacman instead of using uh you know the moving the pixels across the screen maybe i would have used transform translate x to move him across the screen that might be something that you might want to revisit to see if we can improve that instead of using absolute positioning using transform translate so my little rant on why you would use transform translate i'm simply positioning it in an area but because it's gonna be fading in and because you could have it slide up or slide down into position using the transform property is a nicer way of handling its position because it's a bit more dynamic hopefully that makes sense and i didn't go off on a tangent for no reason whatsoever okay so now we've got our tool tip in the right position we want that little arrow to be in the right position so let's find the tooltip after uh and just for consistency i'm gonna move this hover above these styles like so and then down here we're gonna start styling the after so what happens uh let me see i'm going to move down a couple and we said bottom 100 percent and left 50 so that's good but what we actually need to do now is if you can see it needs to be centered properly it's not actually in the center of the tooltip so let's try that transform translate x again and then say negative 50 and i'll see what it does to it so now it is actually perfectly centered this is the same width on the left as it is on the right perfect but it's not below the tooltip we want to be able to see that and that's because let's see if i can do this this is the top border of an element of a five pixel border and so there are three other sides that you can't see so we just need to make the border bottom with zero so that should jump that whole element down so let's try that so we're going to say border bottom width 0. now i could have just used position bottom 100 calc and then extra 5 pixels but i just want to make it easy instead of doing anything else and just say border bottom with 0. so now the border top width is 5 pixels the border bottom width is nothing so that should collapse it down below the tool tip let's see just like i said it would do so that now means that the border bottom of that element is zero you can't it's nothing there taking up space and it jumps that arrow down so that it's just touching the tooltip on the top so there is our top tool tip that's it for that that style right there so now all of them have these styles so that's a little bit of a problem because they need to be a bit more specific so the styles i just styled were for all the tool tips so maybe we'll go back into our css here and what we're going to do is revisit here so the tooltip hover it's going to display all the tool tips on hover we want that but now what we want for for the tool tip top so we want all the tool tips to have these styles but this style is specific to the tool tip top so i'm gonna i'm gonna cut that out and what i'm gonna do is this so i'm going to actually go down to the bottom and i'm going to say tool tip and then i'm going to combine that with the class of top and then the after pseudo element i believe it was before actually was the style we were going for yes so that is the tooltip itself the position of the top tool tip save that okay perfect so now these ones are broken because i'm not selecting them anymore that is more of what we wanted but we also did the after the position of that arrow is wrong so we need to specifically take yes so we're going to take all these styles because that's specific to where it's going to be positioned so now this is just styling all the all of those elements as a as in terms of its look and feel but the position of it we want to be very specific so now down here i'm going to say tool tip top and then the after pseudo element i add these styles so now let's try that tooltip top works great these ones are broken beautiful okay so a quick review we have the tooltip global style just for that pink uh element we have the when you hover the before and after elements will appear um we'll get a display of inline block the default tool tip before styles in fact why don't we just move these up reorganizing my code a little bit here so tool tip and then toolpit tooltip after and tilt it before okay so we've got those three things and then we have tool tip hover before and after then we have tool tip top before that's position to get that in the top center position above the the pink element and then tool to top after which is the little arrow in the bottom in the center that is good so moving on that was the was the bulk of the work i think because now what we're going to be doing is just positioning the we already styled up the tool tip now we just need to position them so that whoops so that the tooltip is on the other right bottom or left and the arrows are in the their respective positions so rolling up our sleeves here we're going to get started let's go down here below tooltip top after give a little bit of space and now what we're going to do is we're going to be styling the tool tip let's do the one on the the right that's the next one tool tip right so those are connected that's a very specific selector i'm selecting the classic tool tip that also has the class of right and before pseudo element now we're going to do is we're going to say top 50 because it needs to be in the center of the element so if we look over here we need that to be centered in vertically so let's go back here and we're going to say left here's what we're going to do so we're going to say left we're going to go calc again the calc function 100 from the left now let's see what's going on here if i save that check it out it's going to be all the way over there the problem here is a couple things it's um we need to have some space for the arrow on that in between the two elements so we're gonna do the calc 100 plus five pixels that will give us that space perfect and the other problem is the the vertical on the y axis the that tool tip on the right is just centered from the top we need to be centered from the the middle of the element that makes sense so we're also going to go transform translate y so it's on the y axis negative fifty percent save that check it out so now we're in the right spot now we need to get that arrow and we need to make that appear properly so now we're going to style tooltip with the class of right and the after pseudo element we're going to say border right color whoops is rgba i don't want to type all this out so i'm going to copy that the rgb zero point ba000.8 and then the border uh we're gonna say top fifty percent so we want it to be down fifty percent and then left one hundred percent so uh let's let's see what that does okay so from the left it's 100 because the parent element is here so left 100 i believe that's the case yep well let's see if i just left zero we'll see what happens yeah so see how it's over here now what the other thing is do you see how there's a little bit of space how it's not actually connected to the left side of the element that's because the other three sides of the border one two and three are invisible they're transparent but the width is still there so i want the left width of the border to be zero so let's do that right now we're going to say border left width zero now check it out now we're right at this the left side now we need to position that to be left 100 like we're originally doing but the problem here is it's not actually aligned in the center of that tool tip and we're going to fix that with the transform property transform and we're going to say translate y and you guessed it negative 50 and that is going to do the trick i believe there it is so the tooltip on the right is done so now we should be able to zip through that was only about three minutes to code that up now our bottom and left should be super easy so let's uh jump down to our bottom so now a little bit of space i'm just gonna space these out a little bit so it's easier to find them good organization so now we're going to style up that bottom so we're going to go tool tip that also has the class of bottom and the before pseudo element the top we're going to need to let's see look at here so in the bottom it needs to be 100 down from the top so top will be calc we're going to do calc again 100 plus the 5 pixels for that little arrow now we're going to do is we're going to go left 50 because we want to be to be centered but that's going to create a problem again check it out it's going to be left from the left side we need to to take off half of the of the width so it's center so we're going to use that transform and we're going to use uh translate on the xaxis translate x and then that's going to be negative 50 percent save that that should get us in the center looking very nice now we just need to position that after pseudoelement tooltip bottom after okay top 100 left fifty percent we're gonna go border bottom color because we want it to appear now rgba zero zero zero zero point eight save that let's see what we got so i can see it there it's right there but it's not centered in the middle of the tooltip and it needs to be up 5 pixels so maybe you guessed it border top width 0 and transform translate x negative 50 percent save that refresh tooltip on the bottom that's looking nice and last but not least tool tip on the left so we're going to give a little bit of space in between here we're going to say tooltip also with the class of left and the before pseudoelement this is kind of like repetition now at this point you might even be able to do this by yourself i challenge you in fact to pause the video what keep me in this frame right here that one and code this one up yourself and then hit play see if you got it right so here we are you've paused the video and uh you've coded it up and you're gonna see if you got this right now keep in mind there's multiple ways of doing getting to the same end result but here's how i'm going to code it up and let's see how close you were i'm going to say top 50 right it needs to be 100 but i need to calculate that with a pixel width so 100 from the right plus five pixels to account for that little arrow transform we're going to trans translate that on the yaxis and we're gonna go negative fifty percent let's check it out that's looking nice and now here we go we're just gonna simply say tooltip uh with the class of left and after we're gonna say top 50 left nope that's not right right 100 now we're gonna go border left color because we want the left arrow to appear and we're gonna say border right width zero so there's no conflict with the size there transform translate on the yaxis it's gonna be negative fifty percent save that boom i think we just nailed it so if that's what your code looks like or something like that good job you got the hang of it that's it for tool tips we got tool tip on the top right bottom and left purely css3 that's awesome it's really lightweight when you do that in css3 we did a couple new things we played around with the transform property which we learned a little bit about why you might want to do that particularly with animations a little challenge for you here if you want because right now these tooltips are just appearing on hover now we've played around with some animations thus far in this css3 in 30 days and we uh you should know or maybe you should be able to figure out how to when you hover make the tooltips fade in or maybe you know slide in slide down or slide over play around with it and see what you come up with i challenge you to make these tooltips a little bit more animated and keep in mind the transform and translate style that we learned about positioning and moving things using that where it incrementally moves into the position rather than uses a hardcoded position absolutely positioned property where it's only clunking over pixel by pixel keep that in mind but a simple challenge for you is to make these tooltips fade in on hover and play with it from there i hope you enjoyed today's lesson hope it gave you a few ideas for your own website's applications and all of that have a good day i'll see you tomorrow and day number 19. diese nueve adios
