00:00 - this episode will be quite short because
00:02 - this week i focused mostly on reading
00:05 - about javascript
00:06 - and finishing and testing recipe box app
00:10 - [Music]
00:27 - so
00:34 - [Music]
00:45 - the two books that i've been reading
00:47 - this week uh the first one is eloquent
00:50 - javascript uh this is available at
00:53 - unlock when javascript.net
00:57 - and it's available there for free when
00:59 - you look in the contents um you can
01:01 - notice that there are some basic parts
01:04 - uh like
01:06 - you know functions values types
01:10 - or um how to
01:12 - deal with bugs and error handling
01:16 - however um
01:18 - revising them
01:20 - after writing some time in javascript
01:24 - it
01:24 - is helpful because uh
01:27 - you
01:28 - see the things
01:30 - a bit differently than you said for the
01:32 - first time when you um when you read
01:35 - about functions
01:37 - or about
01:38 - objects for the first time
01:41 - so
01:42 - it's worth doing really
01:44 - the book has also exercises so at the
01:46 - end of the chapters you will find small
01:49 - exercises um with the console
01:52 - to practice what you've read to practice
01:55 - the theory
01:56 - the second book that i started
01:58 - reading uh this week
02:01 - and
02:02 - i chose parts of it
02:04 - is speaking javascript
02:07 - speaking javascript is available at
02:10 - speakingjs.com i will put the link to
02:13 - this book in the video description below
02:15 - and when you look at the table of
02:17 - contents again
02:19 - you have a quick start with javascript
02:21 - where you have
02:22 - basic javascript issues like
02:25 - syntax uh where to put semicolons where
02:29 - how to put the comments there's
02:30 - something really basic really but
02:33 - later you go to
02:35 - to more
02:37 - complex chapters
02:39 - like javascript in-depth
02:42 - right now i'm choosing the chapters from
02:43 - it that i'm reading on my reading list
02:46 - there's also you download js so you
02:48 - don't know javascript and this is a
02:50 - series that's also for free on github
02:53 - i got interested in this series uh
02:56 - listening to
02:58 - freecode.com new year's
03:01 - eve um
03:02 - livestream javascript 30 with westboss
03:04 - it's also for free and it consists of 30
03:08 - challenges
03:10 - that should be implemented in vanilla
03:13 - javascript i will
03:15 - look into them and choose some to
03:19 - implement
03:20 - so next week i'm going to connect this
03:23 - javascript 30
03:25 - with
03:26 - reading the books
03:28 - this is how the recipe box has changed
03:31 - this week
03:32 - finally i pushed it to the live server
03:35 - it's at the one who does
03:38 - slash recipe box during testing it
03:40 - turned out that i have to change a bit
03:44 - the storage logic the reason for this
03:46 - change was that um
03:48 - my
03:50 - previous storage logic
03:52 - took everything while the user had
03:54 - installed so for example on chrome and
03:57 - there was no problem but on safari and
04:00 - some other browsers
04:02 - well
04:03 - there were things in the storage that
04:05 - were from previous apps from previous
04:08 - actions the user took so i had to change
04:11 - up the storage logic it works right now
04:14 - correctly
04:15 - and it remembers just only the issues
04:18 - connected with recipe box
04:24 - i also added the formatting and
04:27 - ingredients and instructions
04:29 - so
04:30 - in ingredients each enter causes a new
04:33 - line to create um
04:35 - an impression of
04:37 - the list that's unordered of course
04:40 - in the instructions
04:42 - uh each new enter
04:45 - gives a new paragraph and so it's also
04:49 - formatted
04:50 - in my opinion it looks better right now
04:52 - because it's more natural the way a user
04:54 - introduces ingredients it's usually one
04:57 - below the other and also when a user
05:00 - hits enter in such a long text as
05:04 - instructions they get the new paragraph
05:07 - the new thing from this week is also the
05:09 - favicon it's quite simple but still
05:12 - better down on the default
05:14 - that was before here one more thing that
05:17 - was also corrected this week is that
05:19 - during the
05:20 - addition mode
05:22 - these labels and
05:24 - these things were overlapping
05:27 - right now they are not so it's fixed
05:30 - and i'm happy because of that
05:33 - generally this week in this app was a
05:35 - lot about testing introducing some small
05:37 - style changes fixing some small bug
05:40 - issues
05:42 - and this is how it looks when you have
05:45 - more recipes on mobile it looks like
05:47 - that there's one below the other
05:50 - and
05:51 - this is the look on tablet size
05:58 - of course as always there could be more
06:00 - improvements in it and
06:02 - the iterations
06:05 - however version one is finished
06:07 - unfortunately in version one i didn't
06:10 - introduce uh the image resizing
06:13 - uh to prevent the situation when there
06:15 - is not enough storage for
06:18 - uh for the
06:20 - images i wasn't able to do it right now
06:23 - maybe in the next version um it would be
06:27 - better to connect it to the database and
06:30 - to make this image
06:32 - resizing on the server side
06:38 - not sure right now i'm not able to do it
06:41 - this project turns out to be quite
06:42 - complex i'm happy that it's done that
06:46 - the first version is ready to go
06:48 - this is the last episode in this series
06:51 - thank you for all the comments thank you
06:53 - for being with me and thank you for all
06:54 - the feedback i got from you it was a
06:56 - great experience and i leave you with
06:59 - the rest of playlist in free code camp
07:01 - remember to keep on doing and stay
07:04 - motivated
