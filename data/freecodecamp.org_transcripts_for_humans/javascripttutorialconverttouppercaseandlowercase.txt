With timestamps:

00:00 - did you know that in JavaScript you can
00:02 - convert all the characters of a string
00:04 - to uppercase or lowercase you just need
00:06 - to call the two uppercase method to
00:08 - convert them to uppercase and the two
00:11 - lowercase method to convert them to
00:13 - lowercase but you're probably thinking
00:15 - right now aren't strings immutable why
00:18 - can I change them just like that without
00:20 - any errors or bugs well you're not
00:23 - really changing them directly you're
00:25 - creating copies that you can work with
00:27 - and assign to variables so you can use
00:29 - them in program later on
