00:06 - hey everybody its Jesse and the problem
00:13 - that we had yesterday we were working on
00:16 - trying to send data to Reich which is a
00:20 - project management system through the
00:22 - Reich API from our react forum we
00:28 - couldn't get it to work well now it
00:29 - works thanks to Kevin who had a pull
00:33 - request and I didn't check the times
00:36 - exactly but I'm pretty sure that Kevin
00:39 - was able to get it working in less than
00:45 - three hours which i think is pretty
00:47 - amazing so just to put it in context as
00:53 - maybe it will help you see why I think
00:56 - this is so amazing so when I was trying
01:00 - to get this to work months ago using on
01:09 - the client-side in the browser using
01:12 - jQuery I probably worked on it for at
01:17 - least a week maybe more before I got it
01:21 - to work and I had already been using
01:24 - rike sosa miliar with it a little bit
01:27 - not necessarily using their API but
01:32 - Kevin was able from the time I think
01:38 - from the time I ended the stream
01:39 - yesterday to the time of the pull
01:40 - request was about three hours so he was
01:42 - actually able to set up an account with
01:46 - write a free account get the API key
01:49 - learn enough about the API to actually
01:53 - get it working all within a few hours so
01:58 - anyway just amazing so if anybody out
02:03 - there is looking to hire a good
02:05 - developer definitely recommend Kevin
02:09 - because that was just super impressive
02:12 - I mean he's been really helpful
02:14 - throughout the entire project but I was
02:17 - I was very impressed with with that
02:21 - especially since like I said I had so
02:25 - much trouble with it when I first
02:26 - started working with it so I've only
02:30 - added on just a bit to what he had had
02:33 - done today was actually I had a meeting
02:35 - like literally as soon as I got here I
02:37 - didn't even get into my office I still
02:39 - had my laptop in my backpack and
02:41 - everything and I just went straight to
02:42 - my meeting and so I haven't and then
02:47 - after that I was never really added a
02:51 - lot of time a straight stretch of time
02:53 - to work on anything so I haven't really
02:56 - gotten that much done
02:59 - I was I was able to do a little bit so
03:04 - I'll show you we're starting to get a
03:08 - lot in the server.js file which I think
03:11 - I had said that that that was going to
03:13 - happen so it's starting starting to get
03:15 - a little bit hard to find everything but
03:18 - let me let me see okay here's this stuff
03:26 - where we're doing some things with rike
03:29 - and I don't know what is going on and
03:33 - sorry sorry for that just to my train of
03:36 - thought it's just derailed but it smells
03:38 - like I don't know like gasoline or
03:41 - exhaust from heavy machinery in my
03:43 - office right now like really strongly so
03:46 - there's construction going on in the
03:48 - parking lot they're repaving everything
03:49 - so there's a lot of equipment there so
03:52 - maybe that's it but it's really weird
03:54 - like my I'm on the interior of the
03:57 - building so it's not like I'm near a
03:58 - window or anything so I don't know if I
04:04 - if I pass out during this dream then
04:06 - somebody called Franciscan University
04:09 - and tell them to come get me out of my
04:11 - office um Wow it's just really strong
04:15 - I'm gonna keep going because I just
04:16 - started this dream but we'll see
04:21 - hopefully it's not hopefully it goes
04:24 - away I'm gonna
04:25 - turn a fan on just the lowest setting so
04:30 - hopefully that's not too noisy for you
04:32 - all I also do have the Instagram stream
04:38 - going so I had some people stopped in
04:40 - there if you're watching on Instagram
04:43 - and you'd like to see the code on my
04:45 - screen that we're working on please
04:47 - check it out on the free code camp
04:49 - YouTube channel okay so here's what
04:53 - we're working with here see I mean
04:55 - obviously you can see what's been done
04:59 - you can also check it out on github
05:01 - I've already merged in Kevin's pool
05:05 - request if you check out the pull
05:06 - request it was pull requests 31 yeah it
05:10 - was 31 so he provides an explanation of
05:13 - what the issue was and how he fixed that
05:15 - let's see Patrick also helped out as
05:18 - well so he had commented on the pool
05:20 - request and so it was great work there's
05:24 - also an issue going on right now that
05:26 - Sebastian had had raised yesterday
05:28 - during the livestream and then he
05:29 - actually opened up a detailed issue on
05:32 - the github repo about the tests failing
05:36 - so there's a pool request open right now
05:40 - pull request 33 that is being worked on
05:45 - so Sebastian and Kevin and Patrick are
05:50 - all trying to figure out what the issue
05:53 - is so I haven't pulled it in yet because
05:56 - it's not if we get it to a point where I
06:00 - think the problem is solved then I'll
06:02 - pull it in but for now just know if you
06:04 - were getting some errors like some
06:06 - timeout errors on the tests that it's we
06:10 - might have a fix and when I say we I
06:12 - mean they because they're really doing a
06:14 - great job on it and I've I've been
06:17 - working a little bit on some other stuff
06:19 - on here
06:20 - okay so let me let me just go through
06:27 - this quickly basically this is pretty
06:30 - much what fix things so if you remember
06:33 - we were we were trying to put this data
06:35 - in you know same day that pretty much
06:38 - this these things I added and I'll
06:41 - explain this in a second so with the
06:43 - exception of these two lines all of this
06:46 - is from Kevin so some things that he did
06:49 - have to change he had to add this
06:51 - content type header and then also had to
06:57 - encode these key value pairs so if you
07:03 - want to see more of an explanation of
07:05 - this like I said check out the pull
07:06 - request but that's where we're at now so
07:09 - that's pretty much all that changed and
07:14 - as far as what I did so basically
07:17 - without these two lines this makes a new
07:21 - folder and Reich but I needed to make a
07:25 - new project which I don't even know if I
07:27 - said that yet but Reich has folders
07:33 - projects and tasks so the highest level
07:37 - in the hierarchy is the the project and
07:40 - then within the project you can have
07:41 - multiple folders and multiple tasks and
07:44 - things so I'm actually I'm not sure how
07:48 - it all works so we use it as a
07:51 - department as a whole we write to
07:53 - coordinate things like a high level for
07:56 - my projects I use Trello it seems like
08:00 - right can do a lot more than Trello can
08:04 - but I don't need that more so it's
08:08 - easier for me to just do things really
08:11 - simply in Trello since it's usually just
08:13 - me and you all working on the project so
08:18 - anyway to make a folder I actually
08:22 - needed to add I'm sorry to make a
08:24 - project instead of a folder all you need
08:27 - to do is add project and then assign it
08:31 - an owner ID and let me I'm not going to
08:37 - show you the the actual variables but
08:45 - I'm going to change them just a bit
08:54 - and then show you what because I had to
08:57 - do a little bit of a strange thing to
09:00 - get it to work so let me bring this over
09:06 - so that y'all can see okay so this is
09:13 - from my dot n file it's not my entire
09:16 - file obviously but these are what I
09:19 - added here this share ID and owner ID so
09:24 - you can see how I had to put it put it
09:26 - in I actually needed to make this an
09:33 - array in quotes otherwise it kept saying
09:40 - that it was invalid and for this one I
09:43 - had to make an object with owner IDs and
09:48 - then an array with the ID that's the
09:52 - only way would accept it I actually
09:53 - attempted to put all this stuff in here
09:57 - and then just you know had the idea
09:59 - within it didn't work so probably tried
10:02 - I don't know maybe five different
10:04 - combinations of ways to do this and this
10:07 - was what ended up working so if you are
10:09 - working with the right API and you're
10:12 - having issues with this this is how you
10:14 - have to do it
10:15 - I do remember having similar issues when
10:17 - I tried to get this to work with with
10:20 - Ajax on the client side and so I just
10:25 - for that I think I had to do like some
10:28 - escaping of quotes and things like that
10:30 - but basically this is the format that
10:34 - Reich is looking for so not sure if any
10:38 - of you are actually using light right
10:40 - you need to do this but okay so I just
10:47 - got some messages on my Instagram feed
10:49 - that they actually evacuated my building
10:55 - but it looks like
10:58 - I see some people on the hall I think
11:00 - we're good so evidently there was gas in
11:03 - the building they did evacuate nobody
11:07 - seems in a hurry I'm just gonna keep
11:09 - going
11:09 - I'm sure if it's that big of a deal
11:11 - somebody will knock on my door and maybe
11:15 - we'll see actually I'm gonna check the
11:19 - live chat now because I have and I
11:20 - completely forgot to check the live chat
11:27 - let's see okay I still had a lot chat
11:30 - open from yesterday so I was looking at
11:32 - the wrong one for a second let me close
11:34 - that okay so hey everybody
11:38 - oh cool Gavin says hey checking in from
11:42 - Jamaica awesome
11:43 - and I also says he said day five in the
11:47 - series
11:48 - alright cool you you've remembered you
11:50 - said you're gonna start at the beginning
11:52 - of the series so you've caught up with a
11:55 - 5 to 5 days already so that's great
12:04 - shyam says total newbie when it comes to
12:07 - react that's cool that's cool I'm still
12:12 - I think I'm still somewhat of the new
12:15 - bit myself this is a good place I'll try
12:19 - to explain as much as I can
12:21 - thanks I am says that he'll call if I do
12:25 - pass out so thanks
12:32 - okay so Gavin says his tests are also
12:36 - failing locally okay so it's I mean I'm
12:39 - not happy to hear that other people are
12:41 - having problems but it's good to know
12:43 - that at least like it can be replicated
12:45 - which is good because then we could
12:48 - probably narrow it down
12:59 - it looks like some people were coming
13:00 - back into the building so maybe it'll be
13:04 - alright actually hold on one second I'm
13:09 - gonna ask what's going on I turn on the
13:25 - fan and I told the people watching me if
13:26 - I passed out the conference okay so the
13:44 - evacuation is not mandatory I think um
13:48 - I'm good I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna
13:49 - keep streaming and they said the the I
13:55 - guess it's from gasoline oh I'm not sure
13:58 - what's going on but they said it should
14:00 - dissipate soon so I'm slightly
14:05 - lightheaded right now but also I've been
14:10 - feeling a little weird all day like
14:14 - tired and stuff so if you if you see me
14:18 - on the Instagram feed I have like my
14:20 - eyes definitely look like I'm really
14:23 - tired so anyway yeah I was up kind of
14:31 - late last night working on the react
14:33 - course that I'm taking that Udacity
14:36 - course you can actually do a lot of it
14:39 - on your phone which is cool so I was
14:42 - putting the kids to sleep and on my
14:43 - phone doing it and then signed up just
14:45 - staying up and doing it which is cool I
14:48 - guess I'm learning Redux which is
14:50 - awesome but I had dreams about coding
14:56 - all night and I actually had a coding
14:58 - nightmare so I'll get I'll get to the
15:01 - coding it I'll tell the story this will
15:03 - be the last thing before I get actually
15:04 - get to the coding so I know I know some
15:08 - people are a little bit
15:09 - annoyed by the amount of talking I do so
15:11 - I I'll be done in a minute
15:13 - uh-huh but anyway I had a coding
15:17 - nightmare that that last site we worked
15:18 - on the cata catechol institute site that
15:22 - I looked at the site and somehow they
15:25 - had managed to change it all and do the
15:28 - layout with tables and they had like
15:31 - this weird inset border thing that just
15:34 - looked like it was straight out of like
15:36 - the 90s and totally changed the colors
15:40 - everything the images were like all
15:42 - stretched and like not the right
15:44 - dimensions and I was like I was freaking
15:49 - out so actually my wife like was trying
15:52 - to get me to wake up anyways she like
15:55 - touched me I just like jumped up I'm
15:56 - just like wow that was it was terrible
15:59 - so I guess normal people have nightmares
16:02 - about like I don't know like scary
16:05 - things like what but I have nightmares
16:10 - about people changing my layout to using
16:12 - HTML tables so anyway it looks like cool
16:19 - there's some discussion going on in the
16:21 - live chat about those errors with the
16:23 - test so that's awesome so thanks for
16:26 - like I said um I'll pull it in I mean uh
16:31 - if I I haven't been that involved with
16:35 - it one because I had never gotten any
16:37 - errors so if I can't replicate the issue
16:39 - I probably not really gonna be able to
16:42 - contribute that much to fixing it so
16:44 - also it seems like Kevin and Patrick and
16:51 - Sebastian are getting to the bottom of
16:53 - it and seems like you all are close so
16:57 - hey not bad I have a few people in the
17:00 - Instagram stream that's cool they're
17:03 - given some given some love and Instagram
17:06 - so thank you alright so
17:13 - let's do this let me tell you what we're
17:16 - gonna try to do and then then we'll do
17:18 - it so right now where we are is that
17:21 - when I hit the submit button this does
17:23 - make a full project in Reich and I would
17:27 - show you what's going on but I don't
17:29 - want to show you all the stuff that's
17:31 - that my department is working on just
17:34 - there's probably nothing secret in there
17:36 - but just in case somebody would get
17:39 - upset about me showing it I don't want
17:40 - to do it but basically it is working I
17:44 - was able to get a project made what
17:48 - happens when the project gets made is
17:50 - that we get data back and we get a bunch
17:54 - of data back you can actually see what
17:57 - what comes back here so I can I can
18:02 - atleast show you an example of what we
18:03 - get back so this is the response that we
18:06 - get when we create a new folder or
18:11 - project in this case we've we were
18:14 - actually creating a project but they
18:16 - send back pretty much the same thing
18:17 - either way and what we really need is
18:21 - this ID so this is the ID of the project
18:24 - if we have this ID then we can attach
18:28 - files to that project so unfortunately
18:32 - you can't attach the files at the same
18:35 - time that you send the initial data so
18:37 - like all our form data we actually can
18:39 - send initially but we have to wait until
18:43 - we get this ID back so we're gonna get
18:45 - the ID back we're gonna get this value
18:48 - and then we're gonna use that to attach
18:52 - our file so we're gonna check out
18:56 - attachments
18:58 - we want to create attachments yes
19:04 - okay so we'll be using this folder so
19:10 - there's not a separate URL for projects
19:15 - there I guess considered the same loves
19:18 - folders like I said I'm not exactly sure
19:21 - what what the difference is really and
19:26 - Reich but I just know that the people
19:30 - that use Reich a lot said that they
19:32 - would much rather have them be projects
19:34 - and not folders so I made them project
19:40 - so we're going to do
19:49 - basically this obviously this is not in
19:52 - the format that we need to put it in
19:53 - right this is curl but this is what
19:58 - we're gonna do
19:59 - let's see mm-hmm usually they give they
20:07 - say like what everything is that you
20:09 - need to put in the in the call no
20:14 - they're not doing at the Sun okay well
20:18 - basically we'll need the same thing so
20:20 - we need our access token like we're like
20:22 - we're already the language yeah no big
20:24 - deal we're gonna give a file name
20:29 - Content ID oh here we go
20:39 - and then here's our attachment content
20:42 - so I've already done this with with Ajax
20:51 - so I'm going to I'm gonna show you all
20:55 - how I did it with Ajax cuz that'll
20:58 - probably be way easier to read than this
21:00 - curl I don't know about you but like
21:02 - that's not really a format for me if
21:05 - you're using postman you can actually
21:06 - copy and paste this and then convert it
21:08 - to whatever format you like so that's I
21:15 - mean you could do that if you want but
21:17 - since I've already done that before and
21:19 - converted it to be able to use it with
21:22 - Ajax I'll just copy that over
21:30 - so I do need to remove my API key from
21:34 - this so just a second and I will I will
21:38 - do that
21:45 - okay
21:55 - okay so this with Ajax accomplished what
22:00 - we needed so the only thing okay so
22:07 - here's what that project ID goes so in
22:12 - our our URL we just need to add to the
22:16 - to the end actually not to the end
22:19 - because then we still have this
22:20 - attachments here so be folders then the
22:25 - project ID slash attachments okay so we
22:30 - need to okay in our headers are bearer
22:35 - obviously after bear this is where our
22:37 - API key goes okay so I've removed that
22:40 - but there needs to be an API key there
22:43 - and then we just need to add these
22:45 - headers and then our data is going to be
22:51 - so I mean obviously this is a variable
22:54 - from what I'm doing on the current site
23:00 - so let me see
23:07 - I just I'm looking at the code on the
23:10 - other screen and like I said there's API
23:11 - keys in it so I can't show you as well
23:13 - but I'll try to bring over what I can
23:29 - okay I don't I don't think I'm gonna be
23:32 - able to do this in exactly the same way
23:34 - as I did so let me just show you how it
23:41 - was getting that all right so wow this
23:45 - pace over so so weird let me change this
23:50 - to there we go
23:54 - at least we get some syntax highlighting
23:56 - so what I was doing to get the files
24:00 - since this was all client-side
24:02 - I direct Lee had access to the Dom
24:06 - elements so I was getting the upload the
24:12 - actual upload input and then grabbing
24:16 - the files from that to make file lists
24:22 - so not really going to be able to do
24:27 - that
24:33 - so I can't exactly do what I did before
24:35 - but you get the idea of what we're what
24:38 - we're gonna try to do so the first
24:41 - things first is we need to be able to
24:43 - get this ID from the response okay so
24:47 - let's see we already have an example of
24:51 - the response which let me go back to
24:54 - that
25:14 - create folder there we go
25:19 - okay so this is what we need to grab
25:22 - inside data we need to grab ID so let's
25:25 - try to get that and I've forgotten my
25:34 - timer so let's see that as well all
25:40 - right so right now we are getting
25:46 - actually let me see
25:49 - I'm gonna check I'm gonna check the live
25:52 - check because it looks like there's
25:53 - something in here that's definitely
25:55 - relevant
26:01 - okay Kevin says it makes more sense in
26:04 - this case to put the get the attachment
26:07 - from the server yeah well I mean we're
26:09 - already you know we already have it in
26:12 - the server we're saving it so I agree
26:20 - all right so let me does I think that I
26:26 - I will be able to show you the response
26:28 - let me check it really quick to make
26:30 - sure that my API key is not in there
26:48 - okay yeah oh I will be able to bring
26:51 - this over then
26:59 - oops
27:02 - accidentally it's smaller instead of
27:04 - bigger so then make this bigger so y'all
27:08 - can see so this is currently what we're
27:11 - getting back and that it would be
27:29 - so we're we logging this early down here
27:35 - okay so here's where we do the Reich
27:37 - folder you're passing in the what ends
27:43 - up being the name of the folder project
27:55 - okay so we're longing it here
28:15 - nice let me I think this is what this is
28:22 - right that's why we're we're logging not
28:25 - this but this part right our status that
28:32 - we're getting back
28:40 - okay Sebastian says oh so you might want
28:42 - to limit the file types that people can
28:44 - upload yes I'm definitely going to do
28:46 - that so I'm gonna keep saying that for
28:50 - for myself so that I don't forget and
28:53 - thank you for reminding me so yeah
28:56 - before any of this goes live definitely
29:01 - need to make sure we do some some things
29:05 - to limit what can be uploaded or you
29:08 - know whatever at the very least we're
29:10 - gonna limit what can be uploaded
29:12 - I'd like to whatever reasonable steps
29:16 - should be taken when you handle file
29:17 - uploads with node I would like to take
29:20 - those steps so I may need to maybe maybe
29:32 - I'll just do some research
29:34 - I'm sure there's there's some stuff out
29:36 - there about it
29:44 - but let's see for now
29:52 - so I just want to say just can I grab it
29:57 - like that I don't know if that's gonna
30:00 - work let's see let's see what we get no
30:08 - not gonna be able to do it like that
30:18 - is that actually we're kidding
30:34 - that's weird how did that crash
31:19 - oh sorry I was still like I talked about
31:24 - yesterday I still have not done anything
31:27 - to to fix the Corsair so that I was
31:36 - getting and now what did I do
31:56 - oh that's the one right check let me
31:59 - close that cuz we're definitely not
32:00 - gonna use that I'm not gonna use this
32:02 - are they
32:10 - let me just use
32:18 - what I'm gonna do I can't decided I was
32:21 - just gonna use Firefox
32:40 - in Harris the
33:02 - it's not telling me what what the air is
33:04 - Oh
33:14 - all right what did I do
33:33 - okay it should have started
33:52 - yeah she just started it let me
34:10 - okay
34:13 - Oh syntaxerror what did I do
34:30 - oh it's because I tried to console and I
34:37 - forgot to put a plus
34:44 - all that because I forget to put a plus
34:46 - sign oh well template literals have
34:52 - spoiled me Oh
34:55 - remember to put the plus sign in
35:01 - okay
35:04 - now let's see what happens
35:09 - okay so that that in fact is exactly
35:12 - what we want
35:31 - all right let me check
35:32 - [Music]
35:38 - I'm gonna check the live Chad
35:53 - okay thanks Kevin I should have checked
35:57 - the live chat about six minutes ago to
36:00 - avoid in some of this okay so the status
36:04 - status right now is coming in as a
36:05 - string that's that's why
36:13 - so basically we're right here see it
36:22 - says text so it just wasn't thinking so
36:27 - I need to change it
36:32 - it's a JSON and
36:43 - now let's see what we're getting
36:47 - so yeah let's try this data let's see
37:02 - what we get
37:07 - there we go here's what we need all
37:11 - right great
37:12 - so look I can't believe it took what
37:18 - like ten minutes to get to that point
37:20 - about most of that was spent trying to
37:24 - figure out why how I messed up the
37:26 - server but anyway this is what we needed
37:32 - all right so we have the ID that we need
37:34 - I can get rid of this trying to think if
37:44 - there's value in keeping the rest of the
37:50 - status I really have no need of anything
37:53 - else in that status right now so I guess
37:58 - I'm okay with just pulling out this this
38:00 - ID okay there were a few other things
38:05 - about the server in the live chat so let
38:07 - me scan through that quickly
38:18 - okay Patrick says you can set the
38:22 - accepts property input on the front end
38:26 - so I can in the browser client side but
38:30 - you should also check on the back end to
38:32 - prevent people from getting around it
38:33 - yeah for sure
38:35 - so actually if you've never worked with
38:38 - file upload inputs before that's a
38:41 - really good point so basically you can
38:45 - set on the input itself what you want it
38:48 - to be able to accept but people can get
38:51 - around that so I guess like really
38:55 - easily and I don't know maybe you've
38:58 - done this before like you can just
39:00 - inspect something in dev tools and then
39:03 - change it change the HTML and then it
39:06 - will change the way that that field
39:08 - functions so a good example of this is
39:11 - like a password field
39:13 - so if you have a password and password
39:16 - field let's say like you you don't
39:18 - remember what the password was you can
39:20 - just go into dev tools take out password
39:23 - as the type of input and then all of a
39:26 - sudden you'll be able to see the string
39:28 - instead of those little dots so a
39:32 - similar thing could happen so basically
39:34 - doing client-side checking of what the
39:37 - files are and restricting the files is
39:40 - not enough because you can get around it
39:41 - easily so you want to do something on
39:43 - the server side as well so ideally you
39:46 - do both because you do it on the client
39:48 - side so that immediately the user gets
39:51 - feedback that hey you can't you can't
39:53 - upload that otherwise they try to upload
39:56 - it and depending on how you set it up
39:57 - potentially they might not even have any
39:59 - idea that there that file type is wrong
40:03 - so you do it on the client side
40:05 - basically I mean it's pretty much for
40:07 - user experience because people can get
40:10 - around it if they really want to and
40:12 - then on the server side that's where
40:14 - you're checking things and that's more
40:15 - for security the user never sees that
40:18 - they don't even have to know about it
40:20 - but that's where you really want to make
40:23 - sure that you're not gonna like execute
40:27 - a file
40:30 - it's gonna mess up your server today
40:37 - that's my lesson on security today
40:59 - okay so Patrick is giving me some advice
41:03 - here about how I can make the server
41:06 - work
41:27 - all right so let me share this so
41:37 - what
41:49 - how's my permission denied indicating me
41:56 - oh well whatever
41:58 - [Music]
42:14 - okay so let's Oh I'll worry about the
42:19 - the server later I guess not really big
42:22 - deal like right now it's knowing what I
42:25 - needed to do for what we're working on
42:27 - right now
42:37 - okay so just try to remember where we
42:40 - were all right so we have our ID next up
42:42 - is send the files based on that ID so we
42:48 - need to basically we're gonna add
42:52 - another another one of these and so I'm
42:59 - like I'm gonna copy this because a lot
43:02 - of its going to be the same
43:28 - so we're going to take in actually read
43:35 - it we're not taking two things right
43:39 - yeah so we need let me think
43:46 - we need the ID obviously but then we
43:50 - also need the files
44:13 - and let me see how are we getting this
44:18 - file objects
44:48 - okay
45:13 - all right we'll just give it to file
45:16 - [Music]
45:24 - so you don't need to we don't need so in
45:28 - our body basically we don't need any of
45:33 - this stuff we need just the just the
45:47 - files and okay post is fine this is the
45:54 - same content type it's gonna be how do
46:02 - we have to loop through this I
46:10 - I mean shake it just occurred to me that
46:13 - it I may only be able to send one file
46:16 - at a time so I'll have to loop through
46:18 - the files and keep sending the request
46:23 - so I mean that only changed slightly how
46:26 - we do it yeah that actually won't be a
46:35 - huge deal so with I guess then within
47:02 - actually within here might not be a bad
47:04 - place I mean right now all we're doing
47:06 - is just console logging whatever the
47:08 - files are so that will still console.log
47:13 - just to make sure that it's working but
47:17 - within here we could probably call like
47:22 - add attachments and we're gonna need
47:28 - actually we are we're gonna need that ID
47:49 - I had to be careful the order here so
47:54 - we're not actually so within the on end
48:05 - we're making that first call to Reich
48:09 - and then we're getting the data back and
48:11 - then after that is when we want to send
48:18 - the file otherwise we're not gonna have
48:19 - the right ID so this is not the place to
48:23 - do it then
48:25 - here yeah not the place to do it but I
48:32 - still need
48:39 - I wonder
48:51 - all right I have a few ideas I don't
48:54 - think the first one will work let me
48:57 - tell you well a few my ideas are and
48:59 - then I'll give everyone a minute if let
49:02 - me know if you think they'll work and
49:03 - Hut so the first idea is I just do this
49:06 - form on file function and I put that
49:09 - down here so after we get the status
49:13 - back just run that down here I'm
49:17 - thinking hey if that works that's great
49:19 - I'm just not sure if it'll work if I put
49:23 - it in here but we'll see that's probably
49:25 - the simplest thing the alternative would
49:29 - be inside of this right here where it
49:31 - currently is I save the files yeah so
49:42 - I'll save the files to a variable here
49:46 - and then just use that down here and
49:48 - pass that along with the ID I mean
49:55 - obviously like with within a loop like
49:57 - I'm I'm gonna have to call that multiple
49:59 - times
50:05 - yeah okay so those are my two ideas I
50:09 - guess I'll give you a minute to respond
50:13 - to that but the first one would be so
50:16 - easy to test I'm just gonna do that so
50:20 - I'm gonna copy and paste this and
50:23 - [Music]
51:02 - I'm just gonna put two their side don't
51:05 - mix it up alright so basically all I'm
51:10 - gonna see oh I'm looking to see is do I
51:12 - get anything there let's see will you
51:16 - need to upload a few things let's upload
51:18 - three files so we should have that
51:20 - shouldn't be called three times
51:37 - and that doesn't know so from right here
51:40 - so we had it it ran the first time and
51:42 - it did not run the second time okay so
51:46 - for whatever reason that does not run in
51:51 - here so I mean we could try to make that
51:56 - work or move on to the second one my
51:58 - time is up for the Pomodoro session so I
52:01 - am going to take five minutes and go
52:03 - back to the live chat
52:24 - all right so for now I'm looking away at
52:26 - the bottom just to see what would you
52:28 - all have to say about what I was just
52:30 - doing and then if I have time I'll
52:33 - scroll up and see if there's any
52:34 - questions
52:52 - okay Kevin says loop inside the then of
53:03 - the right night folder okay she's saying
53:08 - loop inside
53:15 - this then correct which is what we're
53:20 - gonna try to do
53:43 - okay kevin says it didn't work because
53:47 - we're we would be listening for files
53:49 - after the request was already parsed so
53:52 - since we're we were trying to do this
53:53 - and listen for files inside this on end
53:58 - right it's it's already and it's already
54:01 - been parsed so enough nothing's
54:03 - happening at this point so of course
54:05 - it's not gonna pick up on that so this
54:07 - then is definitely not gonna work so let
54:10 - me just remove that and move to move on
54:14 - to plan B
54:31 - all right Rohan's here hey everyone
54:34 - how's it going
54:36 - Rohan asks what did I miss basically we
54:39 - are we're able to go from our server Jay
54:47 - s file and then on Form submit make a
54:51 - new project in Reich and then we get
54:54 - back the ID of that project and we can
54:57 - take the ID now and we're going to
55:00 - attempt to use that ID to send files and
55:05 - attach them one by one to that that
55:11 - particular project
55:32 - okay I'm scanning really quickly to see
55:35 - if there any questions that I missed
55:49 - trick ISS asks can you tell me how to
55:54 - group content in HTML with div and span
55:56 - properly so not sure if you're still
55:59 - watching because that was asked quite a
56:02 - while ago but if you are I mean I would
56:07 - say properly I don't know that there's a
56:11 - proper way to do it it depends on what
56:13 - framework you're using and what you're
56:14 - trying to accomplish in terms of what
56:17 - divs and spans you use generally most of
56:21 - what you do is going to be in divs you
56:24 - know your spans are more like shorter
56:26 - blocks of content like within like if
56:28 - you if you had a paragraph for instance
56:30 - and one line of that paragraph or even a
56:33 - few words you want to add some special
56:34 - styling to that would be a good place to
56:36 - use a span but the if you had larger
56:41 - chunks of content then you might want to
56:44 - use a div generally that's how how
56:47 - they're used if you're using a framework
56:49 - like an by framework I mean like
56:51 - bootstrap foundation materialise they're
56:58 - gonna have set out how they manage the
57:01 - layout of the page and they're usually
57:03 - with a div structure so a lot of how you
57:06 - do your your divs is gonna be based on
57:09 - what that framework is already laid out
57:12 - so if you're doing it from scratch and
57:14 - you're doing everything I mean you can
57:16 - lay out your dues however you'd like but
57:19 - like I said in general if it's in line
57:23 - like with within you know paragraph
57:25 - spans work well you know a small piece
57:30 - of content otherwise divs are usually
57:32 - used you know for major layout things if
57:36 - you're trying to make like some cards on
57:38 - the page those would be divs hopefully I
57:43 - answer the question I said not sure here
57:45 - you know watching still but maybe it'll
57:47 - be helpful to someone but anymore I
57:50 - always use some sort of CSS framework so
57:53 - the structure of the divs is basically
57:57 - already decided
58:05 - hi Gavin I just saw the comment he said
58:09 - it sounds weird hearing my voice at
58:12 - normal speed because you've been
58:13 - catching up it always sounds weird when
58:18 - I hear my own voice on these things
58:21 - probably it doesn't matter what speed it
58:24 - is it's always weird
58:42 - okay so my timers up I did get about
58:46 - halfway through checking the questions
58:49 - so all of them go back up we'll do
58:53 - another Pomodoro session here and then
58:57 - I'll answer some questions so hey Mark's
59:04 - here hey how's it going you you still
59:09 - still looked in the new job is it going
59:12 - well
59:13 - let me know I haven't I haven't heard
59:16 - about it in a while alright so it looks
59:19 - like cool Kevin has put some some code
59:24 - in the live chat that will most likely
59:28 - do what we're trying to try to do here
59:33 - let's see Kevin always has good code so
59:36 - I'm confident that assuming that I can
59:39 - paste this in the right spot it will
59:41 - work
59:47 - so let me just paste this it's really
59:54 - hard to like read out code so let me
59:58 - paste this in here so y'all can see what
60:02 - I'm saying
60:11 - so basically okay so pretty much what we
60:17 - were basically this is the club code to
60:21 - make like plan B work so we have a files
60:24 - where files and we're going to save the
60:30 - files to this so then we can access it
60:32 - later on even within this form on end
60:36 - and yeah and then we leave this leave
60:45 - this where it is right because it won't
60:47 - work otherwise
60:54 - all right so it's I'll put it up here at
61:00 - some point I'll probably remove this
61:02 - because I won't need the console.log the
61:05 - files but I it would be good for
61:07 - troubleshooting to leave it in at least
61:08 - for now okay
61:48 - probably actually don't need the name in
61:50 - there but I was even in for now okay so
61:55 - same thing that's going on here except
61:58 - instead of console logging we are adding
62:01 - the files to this array so files push
62:07 - file right
62:09 - okay then and since we'll have all the
62:12 - files in this array when we get down to
62:14 - here we can oh yeah
62:25 - okay yeah down to here so we get down to
62:28 - here we will have gotten the ID back
62:31 - right so we can get the ID from here and
62:34 - then we can call our function that's
62:38 - going to attach the file but we will
62:43 - want to loop over that
62:52 - all right yes okay
62:58 - files use coded files right can we do
63:02 - map on this I know it was confused a
63:05 - couple days ago about trying to use a
63:07 - map on things that you shouldn't use map
63:09 - on but it's an array right so we can use
63:12 - map so file add attachments and it's
63:25 - gonna be ID
63:37 - all right so now up here
63:46 - all right here we go
63:58 - yeah okay yeah that's the right order
64:00 - for now let me get rid of this and I
64:06 - just want to
64:18 - so I should be able to get the file name
64:20 - out of that so let's make sure that this
64:22 - works
64:33 - ideas not defined
64:37 - oh I'm sure you've already seen the
64:43 - mistake that I made but what I I just
64:46 - use ID and instead of actually getting
64:51 - the ID here so what I need is this
65:08 - there we go
65:10 - now let's give it a shot whoops file was
65:16 - not defined
65:43 - oh because I was saying files and we're
65:46 - not sending files were only sending one
65:47 - file at a time so better to name it file
65:51 - anyway okay there we go okay awesome so
66:01 - it's working in the sense that it is
66:05 - calling it the correct number of times
66:06 - for each file and we're getting data on
66:09 - a different file each time so in this
66:10 - case we just console.log the name but we
66:13 - have you know the whole object there it
66:17 - is correctly giving us the ID as well
66:19 - great so that's what we need to work
66:22 - with now we just need to use the right
66:25 - format to send this I forgot to start
66:27 - that again
66:29 - awesome so I commented out this bit here
66:40 - also we'll probably I mean we're not
66:44 - gonna want to run this like if there's
66:46 - no if there are no files so we'll
66:53 - probably want to check first to see if
66:55 - there's file but for now I'm not worried
66:57 - about that I just want to get it to work
66:58 - and then I can check
67:07 - okay so I had started to put in what I
67:10 - needed here and then I I don't know what
67:14 - got me sidetracked but I dropped down
67:15 - and started doing some things down below
67:17 - there so now we need to okay so we're
67:22 - sending we're not gonna send files
67:27 - anymore we just want the one file
67:41 - so in the background my music today is
67:44 - some really like mellow jazz it's the
67:47 - coffee table jazz station on Spotify so
67:51 - you have to let me know do I seem like
67:54 - more relaxed and mellow am i coating
67:56 - better than normal or not usually I
67:58 - listen to way more upbeat music like
68:02 - electronic music and stuff so I'm kind
68:05 - of interested to see what would affect
68:07 - different types of music have on my
68:09 - coding not really very scientific can't
68:18 - really keep all the factors the same
68:20 - from you know each time I code but
68:24 - you'll see
68:31 - okay so Kevin said it's it's fine to not
68:36 - check for their files because if there
68:38 - are no files the loop would just run
68:40 - zero times yeah that makes sense this
68:42 - cool all right well we have actually a
68:47 - really low viewer count today not sure
68:49 - what's going on maybe maybe I am really
68:55 - really boring today because I'm I'm too
68:57 - mellow because I'm listening to the Jess
68:59 - anyway I'm not really sure what if it
69:04 - causes people to view or not view some
69:06 - days there's a lot of people in some
69:07 - days there's not and I'm doing the same
69:10 - thing pretty much every day alright so
69:17 - we need here on the other side this is
69:22 - what we need so let's add in headers
69:26 - content
69:47 - yeah
69:52 - oops
69:57 - and we can get filed me
70:08 - content-type oh now I remember why I
70:12 - went down cuz when I looked at this and
70:15 - these two I realized oh we're only
70:18 - sending one file at a time and that's
70:19 - when I started thinking about how we can
70:23 - get one file at a time okay
70:40 - oops
70:52 - I think that's what it is we'll find out
71:08 - awesome and okay so instead of data we
71:13 - have body okay and file will work all
71:20 - right so this looks oh we need the URL
71:25 - to be different so I need the ID in
71:32 - there so I'm gonna I'm not gonna use an
71:35 - environment variable
71:43 - I'm going to use a template literal and
71:52 - with the ID and then attachments
72:03 - great
72:17 - all right that should be enough actually
72:20 - I don't know I'm not really sure if I
72:25 - need these we'll try it without it but I
72:27 - guess we'll see we'll see how it goes
72:32 - okay so let's see
72:39 - okay so when we hit submit this time it
72:42 - should create a project in Reich with
72:45 - the title of tests it's not gonna have
72:47 - any data in there because I'm not we're
72:49 - not actually putting any data in there
72:51 - right now
72:52 - it might have actually we will it'll
72:55 - just say folder description as the the
72:58 - body of you know the project will get
73:05 - the ID back and then it will add
73:08 - probably we'll just do the same three
73:12 - image files will get added to that and I
73:17 - will verify that on my other screen
73:18 - where I have reich open so I'll be able
73:24 - oh man
73:25 - well yeah we actually just made a ton of
73:27 - test folders so I bet our project
73:33 - manager is wondering what's going on
73:35 - so anyway whoa let me delete quickly all
73:39 - the tests folders we have now so I don't
73:41 - have to search through them to find
73:42 - which one is the one we want to look at
73:48 - there's no batch delete option and
73:55 - that's unfortunate because I have a lot
73:58 - of testing
74:08 - so I guess Reich recently came out with
74:11 - a desktop app which is kind of cool but
74:15 - also not not really great because I had
74:20 - thought that one of the first desktop
74:23 - apps that I would try to make once I
74:26 - finally learned how to make desktop apps
74:27 - with react would be a Reich desktop
74:31 - client for my my department but they
74:35 - already beat me to it so I guess it's
74:39 - cool either way we have it I just
74:41 - thought it would be cool to do but
74:43 - anyway let's give this a try now
74:47 - so I've deleted out all the other tests
74:50 - that we made whoa crash what'd I do
74:55 - oops I put at least I remember just to
75:01 - check this
75:12 - I D is not defined where
75:21 - Oh
75:24 - why is ID not defined we're getting an
75:28 - ID
75:47 - okay that's why
75:50 - all right let's give it a shot
75:58 - all right so I've seen the project has
76:00 - been created and awesome let me see
76:15 - did the file go through Oh No okay so
76:22 - the project was created the file the
76:26 - correct file names came through but when
76:30 - I try to click on them it says the file
76:34 - appears to be invalid or broken sorry we
76:37 - can't load it so I did something wrong
76:40 - but so here's what we know is working
76:42 - which the good news is we know that it
76:46 - is actually getting the ID back and it's
76:49 - sending in this case three requests so
76:52 - it's sending a request for each file
76:54 - that we've we've uploaded which is great
76:58 - the correct file name is getting there
77:00 - the only thing is the file itself is not
77:05 - working which I didn't really check what
77:10 - let's see so I'm sending
77:21 - this
77:39 - okay I'm not sure why that happened
77:43 - let's take a look so we're getting the
77:45 - file scroll down here okay so here's
78:00 - your eating the files from on file okay
78:05 - so the files here
78:13 - all right let me let me check the live
78:15 - chat to see what y'all think okay
78:20 - Patrick says for each would be more
78:22 - appropriate okay cool I'll change that
78:24 - to four each
78:34 - Rohan says I need upbeat slash EDM or
78:37 - something similar for me to get to do
78:39 - anything yeah this morning I don't know
78:42 - what it was I was listening to some like
78:45 - really upbeat electronic music and I
78:49 - don't know I was just feeling weird and
78:52 - was feeling like I don't know like a
78:57 - little bit like I was getting a headache
78:59 - and I couldn't focus and I thought like
79:02 - I don't know like maybe I just need to
79:05 - chill a little bit
79:06 - so I so I did so I relaxed a little bit
79:09 - I put my feet up on my desk and just
79:12 - listen to some jazz for a bit and I
79:14 - started feeling better so that's why I
79:15 - went with it but like 90 probably 95% of
79:19 - the time I do this in the upbeat music
79:30 - Oh
79:33 - okay Kevin I just saw your message about
79:35 - the content-type is that's what what's
79:38 - messing this up actually that makes
79:45 - sense maybe the content-type is doing
79:48 - that so what maybe this isn't where I
79:52 - need to get let's see file type
80:08 - now actually that it that is it it is
80:11 - tight that's what I need
80:29 - it's twice oh okay that that makes sense
80:37 - good good either
80:41 - okay cool I'm I'm actually really happy
80:43 - about that because that that was
80:45 - probably our a problem and otherwise I
80:48 - was a little bit at a loss as to what
80:50 - could the issue could be all right is
80:52 - even another shot okay no errors let's
80:59 - check it out
81:12 - hmm actually I got the same problem as I
81:17 - did the last time this do the order does
81:23 - the order matter here I'm not sure if
81:29 - the order matters but I guess when I did
81:36 - it over here where did I have it at no I
81:39 - had it here so it shouldn't matter
81:55 - I think what's going on
82:35 - I just want to see what we're actually
82:38 - getting and we do this okay
82:45 - that that seems like the right type
82:49 - right
82:53 - try content type application okay let's
83:00 - try
83:12 - okay so let's check out so in the
83:17 - example reusing oops this is not it
83:29 - in the example it's using this is the
83:34 - content type so let's give that a shot
84:10 - same thing same issue
84:39 - okay so I actually downloaded the file
84:41 - from Reich just to see what would happen
84:44 - so yeah it won't be damn it she's a file
84:49 - format preview doesn't recognize okay
85:13 - see
85:31 - okay right now I'm just kind of looking
85:33 - over the code and seeing if I can see
85:36 - something and think of something that
85:38 - that we're missing here
86:15 - I wonder if they're looking for
86:16 - something like we had had done before so
86:36 - actually no we didn't end up doing that
86:38 - I'm sorry I was thinking about one of
86:40 - the possible solutions to this and I
86:42 - think what I was thinking I've ended up
86:44 - not working anyway
87:39 - well we we got pretty far without
87:42 - hitting a really serious issue so it's
87:44 - not bad I do want to see the times yeah
87:49 - I want to give this working so this
87:52 - stream may end up being a bit long but I
87:56 - have an appointment at 5:00 p.m. which
87:58 - is its Eastern time so I can definitely
88:03 - go for Fri another hour so let's say
88:06 - let's give this issue like a half hour
88:09 - and that would leave a half hour for
88:11 - questions probably won't need that long
88:12 - but you never know maybe we'll need it
88:14 - and I say that just because there's not
88:16 - a whole lot of viewers right now so
88:24 - let's let's try anyway so we got about a
88:29 - half hour about another we'll do one
88:32 - more Pomodoro session to work on this
88:34 - problem we'll take our five minutes to
88:38 - do a little some some questions and
88:40 - catch up in the kinda live chat
89:05 - I'm just right now I'm just going
89:06 - through right now making sure I didn't
89:09 - misspell anything
90:01 - okay just checking to see like the files
90:04 - that we are getting are being uploaded
90:06 - and they work so something something's
90:18 - happening and we really transfer the
90:19 - files then
91:19 - all right well yeah I figured that
91:25 - Sophia
91:25 - all right so now's a good time to take a
91:27 - break usually when I get stuck like this
91:28 - if I do take a little break it's usually
91:32 - I'll get some idea at least something
91:34 - new to try so I'm gonna go back to the
91:39 - live chat I'm gonna scroll up to where I
91:41 - left off at before and try to get to any
91:43 - questions or see if I missed anything
91:47 - and then in five minutes we'll go back
91:52 - to this problem at this point honestly I
91:57 - don't have any ideas for what to try
92:01 - next so hopefully I think of something
92:08 - now we got a few more viewers it was
92:11 - actually we're down to sixteen viewers I
92:13 - saw at one point which is crazy we're
92:17 - never that low so I don't know what's
92:21 - going on the only times we've been this
92:23 - little before is once the YouTube
92:27 - notifications weren't it just people
92:30 - didn't get them a lot of people didn't
92:32 - get them and then the other time I was
92:34 - trying to stream during some big tech
92:36 - conference and the tech conference was
92:37 - live-streaming and I didn't realize it
92:39 - so other than that we usually have more
92:43 - people than this all right where'd I
92:48 - leave love okay
93:08 - alright see there's still a lot of
93:10 - discussion about this
93:12 - there's Aires
93:33 - okay cool so it looks like Gavin was
93:37 - able to get the test to pass so that's
93:44 - that's cool good to hear that
94:04 - okay Patrick and Rohan I see I see
94:08 - everything you're saying about trying to
94:10 - get the the localhost 3000 to work so oh
94:15 - they said I'll try that out later on
94:18 - today or maybe early tomorrow
94:59 - haha now I said I see how many times you
95:02 - all were trying to tell me that I had
95:05 - content-type in there twice sorry I
95:07 - didn't I didn't look over and see that
95:10 - thanks for continuing to try to try to
95:14 - remind me about that
95:29 - okay Joseph said that that that actually
95:34 - works so basically the way that we're
95:36 - doing it up here worked for you and
95:40 - postman so I wonder what's going on no
95:49 - page John Hanson said finally I caved
95:55 - and installed create react app so over
96:00 - the last oh I don't I don't even know
96:02 - how long John's been working with react
96:05 - but trying to set up react and web pack
96:07 - and everything from scratch so he
96:12 - finally went with create react app which
96:14 - if you're not familiar with that that
96:16 - lets you kind of bootstrap react project
96:18 - and get started without having to know
96:20 - anything about web pack so alright cool
96:25 - let me know how it goes then at least
96:28 - you can get started and start doing
96:29 - react stuff and not worrying about your
96:31 - build
96:56 - okay John John Hanson said that he got
97:00 - his YouTube notification exactly on time
97:03 - so maybe it's not the YouTube stuff who
97:09 - knows what it is
97:24 - oh wow okay so Patrick's and YouTube
97:27 - notifications haven't been on time in a
97:30 - month sometimes he gets notified the
97:32 - next day wow that's crazy
97:46 - kayvon I'm not I'm not sure how you how
97:50 - to pronounce that exactly that what
97:52 - syllable to put the emphasis on but I'm
97:54 - gonna say
97:56 - kayvon and then because we have a
97:59 - Kevin's I'm gonna try to differentiate
98:03 - that but is asking if I use Redux so I
98:07 - did not use Redux for this project but
98:10 - probably be using Redux in a future
98:13 - project because I'm learning it right
98:15 - now so I'm taking a course from Udacity
98:17 - on redux
98:19 - so I was working on it earlier today on
98:22 - my lunch break
98:22 - so Redux will be coming most likely as
98:27 - soon as I get done with this course and
98:29 - I get a project where it would make
98:31 - sense to use redux okay so that was I've
98:37 - gotten to the to the end of the live
98:39 - chat and I've also gotten to the end of
98:41 - that break so let's give it one more
98:43 - Pomodoro cycle and give it a shot try to
98:45 - get this to work and we'll see so
98:51 - basically like everything is working
98:53 - just how we want it I mean we obviously
98:57 - we need to fine-tune things before this
98:59 - would be ready to go you know in a live
99:01 - situation but basically everything's
99:04 - working except the files won't go
99:08 - through properly it's in terms of like
99:12 - it won't open we get the file name it
99:14 - shows up as if it's a file but when you
99:16 - click on it it says the file appears to
99:19 - be invalid or broken so let's try I'd
99:26 - like to try maybe this is try a
99:32 - different file type so I have this xcf
99:36 - file
99:41 - and see if that works
99:54 - mmm
100:01 - and actually that's weird
100:11 - that did not get through at all
100:24 - I mean let me show you again let's
100:27 - refresh show it one more time
100:45 - that's odd it's actually it is creating
100:49 - when I do that it's creating new
100:50 - projects but it's trying to add those
100:58 - three there we go finally for for some
101:04 - reason when I try that the first two
101:06 - times it was trying to add the same
101:07 - three files again really weird all right
101:14 - so let's see it looks like it did the
101:16 - same thing for this as well I'm gonna
101:22 - download it and open it up just just to
101:25 - be sure
101:35 - well there we go and it said it cannot
101:40 - open the image all right
101:42 - so definitely doesn't matter what type
101:45 - it is
101:52 - all right so I guess now it's time to do
101:55 - a little bit of research then and maybe
102:04 - I can try
102:12 - I'm sure either either stackoverflow or
102:16 - we're gonna go to NBN's documentation on
102:20 - file files let's see
102:49 - okay got some stuff
103:00 - so that's a good sign let's see I'll
103:03 - pull this over and
103:13 - let's see this so nothing obviously with
103:17 - Reiki API alright so I got a few up here
103:23 - let's see what's going on
104:01 - okay a lot of less ones for this let's
104:05 - see doesn't seem to be fixed
104:13 - all right let's try another one let's
104:15 - see if that won't ever get fixed
104:28 - okay so this is we are using SendGrid
104:31 - and our files actually might not maybe
104:37 - we can try I don't want to try it right
104:40 - now but if we can't figure anything else
104:41 - else out maybe we could try to send the
104:44 - file as an attachment to our emails that
104:48 - we're sending through SendGrid and see
104:51 - if we can get it to work through there
104:54 - maybe that I mean at least maybe we
104:58 - could rule rule some things out maybe
105:01 - but let's see what's the
105:23 - all right that's not going to be helpful
105:54 - all right I'm not sure okay so it was
106:01 - false broken
106:29 - okay not really anything there that's
106:32 - useful
106:53 - okay no answers for that one all right
107:00 - let me check and the live chat here
107:05 - looks like there's a few things
107:18 - okay so Kevin I see your comments let's
107:22 - try them out I'm going to try to do some
107:25 - debugging
107:40 - okay
108:31 - all right let's see what we're getting
108:32 - there
109:06 - that's odd which should it be
109:09 - [Music]
109:27 - I guess that's it's close enough I was
109:32 - thrown off by the type right but I guess
109:34 - that's what is supposed to be
109:58 - okay so kevin says formidable files
110:01 - don't appear to be noted buffers which
110:04 - note fetch handles well so maybe reading
110:07 - the file directly from the path with FS
110:10 - read file to get an actual buffer okay
110:23 - so let's see I'm gonna need some help so
110:26 - see where so where am I gonna do
110:32 - where am I gonna put FS da tree file
110:45 - are we talking like where we somewhere
110:54 - in here where we're grabbing the files
111:06 - the project managers sent me a message
111:09 - on slack and said dude I'm getting like
111:12 - a test email every minute from you yes
111:17 - this is happening
111:33 - okay so let's try to put
112:09 - okay so can I do something like this on
112:13 - this this file before we send it over or
112:16 - do I need to put it higher up
112:26 - guys this we're talking this is we're
112:31 - talking about here
112:44 - okay not there
112:59 - that's so Patrick had a good idea that I
113:04 - could just set up a free bike account to
113:06 - use for testing then I can show you all
113:08 - what's going on and I won't spam
113:10 - everyone else with this stuff that's a
113:13 - great idea she was excited that when I
113:16 - told her I'm working on the new version
113:18 - of the Resource Center so don't think
113:23 - it's that it's that big of a deal but it
113:25 - would be cool to be able to show you
113:26 - what it looks like
113:38 - okay let's see
114:01 - I suppose you said path to an upload
114:04 - directory file where
114:31 - all right so I see Kevin and Patrick are
114:34 - putting some code in the live chat for
114:38 - me but all right so I'm a little bit
114:44 - confused all let me paste this up here
114:53 - so everyone can see I'll get rid of this
114:56 - stuff
114:57 - all right so kevin has posted this and
115:03 - Patrick this
115:16 - and I'll have to wait a minute there's a
115:18 - look there's a delay on the video so
115:21 - I'll have to wait a second to get a
115:24 - response here so
115:41 - so I could put this
116:27 - okay John Hanson said I'm confused too
116:29 - thanks for saying that Jonah it makes me
116:31 - feel better I'm not the only one that's
116:34 - that's confused yeah Kevin and Patrick
116:38 - you guys are awesome and so I don't
116:45 - you're just like both of you are so
116:49 - knowledgeable and I think you're just
116:53 - like steps ahead of me all the time so
116:57 - it takes me a minute or two to catch up
116:59 - and figure out where you all are at okay
117:08 - so we it looks like we have a better way
117:10 - than to do this so let me show you the
117:16 - latest okay so if it's rifo
117:30 - so this is going to go then we're in in
117:37 - here
117:47 - or do I need to put this inside here
117:53 - instead of
118:07 - okay patched it inside the files thought
118:10 - map which should be files thought for
118:12 - each okay yeah I never changed the
118:14 - Fourier so each is it file of files or
118:34 - file in files I can't remember which one
118:36 - it is
118:37 - we'll see see if it works
119:07 - okay this in all right thanks Ron
119:11 - [Music]
119:20 - I don't know I don't smell the gas
119:22 - anymore here but I'm definitely feeling
119:24 - lightheaded
119:27 - maybe I'm just used to it I can't even
119:29 - smell it anywhere
119:40 - oh okay cool Patrick says I can just do
119:43 - files that or yeah where my follows up
119:47 - for each and then
119:56 - well
120:00 - let's cool
120:12 - all right so
120:15 - now I'm going to put that in here and
120:17 - then get rid of this portion of it and
120:22 - this portion yeah okay
120:31 - that's great okay so we have files for
120:35 - each ferry foul
120:51 - I think this is what you're trying to
120:55 - tell me so I mean just check this out
121:25 - okay so instead of the file we're
121:28 - sending this buffer all right
121:54 - okay so we need the file name header
121:58 - which so okay so that's not I can't get
122:05 - the name anymore from that so maybe I
122:09 - should just pass in I mean I know I can
122:16 - get it on the of ik so I guess I could
122:18 - pass in a name and tight
123:13 - oh this is a good sign look at that file
123:16 - size I'm feeling good about this one
123:20 - let's check it out I'm trying to find
123:31 - which one is the the right one cuz
123:33 - they're all just named test there we go
123:38 - all right
123:39 - it works yay let me see I can show you
124:01 - I'll show you a little bit of it
124:06 - basically I'll just zoom in and hide all
124:08 - the stuff that I'm not sure whether or
124:10 - not I should show just because it's
124:14 - exciting that it finally works so here
124:23 - we go check it out so anyway Liz sorry
124:27 - I'm putting your name out on YouTube but
124:34 - [Music]
124:35 - there we go there's our files and
124:40 - there's our our project tests folder
124:45 - description here and our files
124:47 - so just in time this just went off right
124:54 - after we get it to work so that's
124:58 - awesome I'm excited I'm happy let's just
125:02 - really quick kind of go over what we did
125:05 - that made it work and definitely thanks
125:10 - to Patrick and Kevin for figuring this
125:14 - one out because I was I had obviously
125:17 - tried everything that I could think of
125:18 - at the moment so let's go so basically
125:23 - the the what we did different then was
125:28 - instead of sending you know whatever
125:32 - this file was that we were sending and
125:37 - we used FS read file and
125:48 - we were able to get the buffer and put
125:53 - that in there so I'm not familiar with
126:01 - with this FS rifo I'm not familiar
126:03 - enough to explain in any more depth than
126:05 - that why it worked but just hang if
126:10 - you're trying to use a similar setup
126:12 - which sometimes people are sometimes I
126:14 - get messages from people that say like
126:17 - that they've cloned my repo and then
126:19 - they're modifying and using it for their
126:20 - project so if you're trying to do
126:23 - something similar this is the fix
126:26 - probably want to read up more on exactly
126:29 - what's going on here
126:31 - so I'm lazy I'm not gonna attempt to
126:33 - explain it because I don't I don't know
126:35 - enough to feel comfortable explaining
126:37 - how this works I've never used it but
126:42 - that was the solution and awesome yes
126:47 - I'm celebrating going on there in the in
126:51 - the live chat so yeah really awesome
126:55 - it's it's great whenever we can get
126:58 - things working figure it out so alright
127:03 - so I'm gonna go now and do some question
127:06 - and an answer here in a minute so if
127:08 - you're just here for the code that
127:11 - portion is done otherwise you're going
127:14 - to stick around for question answers put
127:15 - your questions and the live chat now and
127:18 - I'll try to answer them you could also
127:22 - ask me questions on any social media
127:24 - channels and I will try to get back to
127:27 - you as soon as I can I will say this I
127:29 - have I'm a little bit behind on the
127:31 - YouTube comments on getting to them all
127:33 - so I've just been obviously really busy
127:36 - between work and then some side project
127:40 - work that I have for clients and the
127:42 - Udacity course and then my wife and four
127:44 - kids it's it's pretty busy so I do I try
127:50 - to get to the comments I've seen some of
127:52 - them and just not really had time to
127:53 - give you a good answer so I I'm not
127:57 - ignoring you so if you're waiting on me
127:59 - to reply
128:00 - comment I'll try to get to it whenever I
128:02 - can so anyway before I get to the
128:08 - questions just quick recap of where we
128:10 - are and where we need to go so from this
128:12 - point we can get data from our form that
128:18 - data can then get emailed it can get
128:22 - sent to a project management system
128:23 - along with the file uploads our file
128:26 - uploads are also getting saved to our
128:28 - uploads folder so what we need to do
128:31 - then is actually send the data that a
128:35 - user uploads through the form okay so
128:37 - from all those text inputs and check
128:39 - boxes okay so we need to send that
128:42 - format it in a way that's somewhat
128:45 - decent so that it shows up in a readable
128:48 - way in our project management system in
128:51 - our and in our emails and then we need
128:56 - to put some sort of security measures in
128:58 - place to limit what gets uploaded what
129:02 - type of files get uploaded probably want
129:06 - to limit the size of the uploads as well
129:08 - I I suppose could get crazy if you know
129:12 - we get a really huge people trying to
129:14 - upload a lot of really huge files so
129:16 - probably want to do a limit on the
129:18 - number of files that can be uploaded at
129:20 - any one time and also the size that any
129:25 - one file can be let me think and I guess
129:31 - that's it for the forum the only other
129:33 - thing we had talked about doing that I'm
129:34 - still not sure about is having some sort
129:36 - of database to store this data or
129:39 - possibly sending the at least the data
129:43 - from the text fields and checkboxes to a
129:45 - Google sheet just to have a backup
129:46 - somewhere so still not sure about those
129:51 - may or may not happen we'll see and then
129:55 - other than that we do have one other
129:57 - forum that's going to be a very simple
129:59 - form to deal with no file uploads just a
130:01 - few text fields and we just have some UI
130:05 - stuff you know some basic things
130:07 - probably the only difficult I won't even
130:09 - say difficult the the most difficult
130:11 - thing
130:12 - that will have to deal with after this
130:13 - is our images because we're gonna want
130:16 - you'll see I'll show you in an upcoming
130:19 - stream but our images are using isotope
130:27 - so I don't if you ever worked with
130:29 - isotope before but a JavaScript library
130:31 - that's called isotope and I can't
130:35 - remember if it depends on jQuery or not
130:38 - so we'll see but we'll try to do
130:40 - something similar with react and see
130:45 - what we can get all right so now I'm
130:49 - gonna go to the live chat and let's see
130:57 - yang Jian Xiao says I'm new here it
131:01 - seems like I'm at the end hi yeah you
131:03 - are you are at the end so yeah sorry
131:05 - about that but you will yeah as I'm

131:10 - recording so you thanks for for joining
131:14 - in though and thanks for for saying hi
131:16 - in the live chat hopefully you can make
131:19 - a live stream in the future at some

132:16 - up a bit I did get through most of the
132:17 - live shot already so I won't have to
132:19 - scroll up too much but I want to just
132:21 - double check make sure I didn't miss any
132:23 - questions
132:31 - okay I'm Blair tail has some some
132:33 - helpful tip here it says one small
132:36 - editor thing that I use a lot in Visual
132:38 - Studio that works in Adam - just
132:40 - different keystroke if you want to move
132:42 - blocks of code up or down select the
132:45 - lines and push control arrow keys
132:47 - instead of cut paste okay cool I see I'm
132:56 - gonna try that
133:01 - so I don't know if I don't know if you
133:06 - gave me the keystrokes to do it in
133:08 - Visual Studio or an atom but I'm gonna
133:10 - try it so ctrl arrow keys alright that
133:17 - didn't work this rectum I know
133:20 - okay so different yeah different in atom
133:25 - so I'll have to see what it is an atom
133:27 - but that yeah that actually will be
133:30 - helpful to me so thank you for that
134:00 - now billion says you sound like Remi
134:03 - Malik that's cool I've never had anybody
134:10 - say that before but I'll take it I'll
134:12 - take it I like I like him Umberto's says
134:18 - I love mr. robot yeah so Remi Malick is
134:21 - the the guy the actor that plays the
134:23 - lead character on the show mr. robot so
134:26 - actually I watch season 1 and then a few
134:28 - episodes into season 2 so yeah it was it
134:33 - was pretty cool it was really
134:36 - interesting just just I don't know to
134:41 - hear about all like the different like
134:42 - hacker stuff and how they do things
134:44 - it was pretty interesting although I
134:47 - haven't seen anybody that's watched
134:49 - after like season basically from the end
134:52 - of season 1 on is it still good like is
134:55 - it should I try to watch the second
134:58 - season then I mean season 1 was pretty
135:00 - good
135:18 - okay so maybe it's different on a Mac to
135:22 - do let's see let me try it again yeah
135:30 - and then I tried command
135:31 - I tried control yeah while controls
135:36 - doing crazy stuff on my other screens
135:41 - let's try option no not option no yeah
135:47 - not really sure it's probably some
135:49 - combination command command control oh
135:57 - cool
135:58 - Joseph awesome thank you so Joseph came
136:03 - through with the correct so if you want
136:06 - to do this which actually looks really
136:09 - cool now that I'm doing it on a Mac on
136:13 - Adam on a Mac you use command control
136:18 - and then your up and down arrow keys
136:22 - that's really cool I like that and for a
136:29 - single line you don't need to select
136:30 - anything yeah let's try that oh nice
136:33 - check that out don't even a select so
136:36 - that was that came from Kevin thanks
136:37 - Kevin
136:38 - that's really cool alright rohan says
136:42 - season two of mr. robot is good alright
136:45 - awesome so it is just season two season
136:52 - three have they had a season three yet
137:10 - all right
137:12 - well I've gotten to the end of the live
137:14 - chat this has been over to our streams
137:19 - so I'd say now is the decent place to to
137:22 - stop okay cool it's I guess season 3 mr.
137:28 - robots coming out in October
137:30 - alright cool good to know off to check
137:34 - it out and see the last time I checked
137:36 - on Amazon Prime video they only had
137:40 - season 1 but maybe though maybe they'll
137:42 - have season tution since season 3 is
137:44 - coming up but I think that's that's
137:50 - about it for today
137:51 - I'm actually pretty exhausted I don't
137:53 - know if it's all the gas streams that
137:55 - I've breathed in today if you're
137:58 - confused by that watch the beginning so
138:01 - or just in general being tired or you
138:05 - know exhausted from all the code but it
138:08 - was pretty cool we definitely
138:09 - accomplished what we wanted to
138:11 - accomplish today thanks to to your help
138:15 - and so tomorrow I'm not exactly sure
138:20 - we'll be doing tomorrow whether we'll
138:22 - try to polish this a little bit more or
138:25 - move on to something different
138:26 - we'll see but thank you so much for
138:31 - watching and for for all the help and
138:34 - the live chat I really appreciate that I
138:37 - will be back tomorrow and probably same
138:41 - time I haven't checked my schedule yet
138:43 - but probably at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time
138:46 - and we'll work on this a little bit more
138:50 - so until then have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and the problem that we had yesterday we were working on trying to send data to Reich which is a project management system through the Reich API from our react forum we couldn't get it to work well now it works thanks to Kevin who had a pull request and I didn't check the times exactly but I'm pretty sure that Kevin was able to get it working in less than three hours which i think is pretty amazing so just to put it in context as maybe it will help you see why I think this is so amazing so when I was trying to get this to work months ago using on the clientside in the browser using jQuery I probably worked on it for at least a week maybe more before I got it to work and I had already been using rike sosa miliar with it a little bit not necessarily using their API but Kevin was able from the time I think from the time I ended the stream yesterday to the time of the pull request was about three hours so he was actually able to set up an account with write a free account get the API key learn enough about the API to actually get it working all within a few hours so anyway just amazing so if anybody out there is looking to hire a good developer definitely recommend Kevin because that was just super impressive I mean he's been really helpful throughout the entire project but I was I was very impressed with with that especially since like I said I had so much trouble with it when I first started working with it so I've only added on just a bit to what he had had done today was actually I had a meeting like literally as soon as I got here I didn't even get into my office I still had my laptop in my backpack and everything and I just went straight to my meeting and so I haven't and then after that I was never really added a lot of time a straight stretch of time to work on anything so I haven't really gotten that much done I was I was able to do a little bit so I'll show you we're starting to get a lot in the server.js file which I think I had said that that that was going to happen so it's starting starting to get a little bit hard to find everything but let me let me see okay here's this stuff where we're doing some things with rike and I don't know what is going on and sorry sorry for that just to my train of thought it's just derailed but it smells like I don't know like gasoline or exhaust from heavy machinery in my office right now like really strongly so there's construction going on in the parking lot they're repaving everything so there's a lot of equipment there so maybe that's it but it's really weird like my I'm on the interior of the building so it's not like I'm near a window or anything so I don't know if I if I pass out during this dream then somebody called Franciscan University and tell them to come get me out of my office um Wow it's just really strong I'm gonna keep going because I just started this dream but we'll see hopefully it's not hopefully it goes away I'm gonna turn a fan on just the lowest setting so hopefully that's not too noisy for you all I also do have the Instagram stream going so I had some people stopped in there if you're watching on Instagram and you'd like to see the code on my screen that we're working on please check it out on the free code camp YouTube channel okay so here's what we're working with here see I mean obviously you can see what's been done you can also check it out on github I've already merged in Kevin's pool request if you check out the pull request it was pull requests 31 yeah it was 31 so he provides an explanation of what the issue was and how he fixed that let's see Patrick also helped out as well so he had commented on the pool request and so it was great work there's also an issue going on right now that Sebastian had had raised yesterday during the livestream and then he actually opened up a detailed issue on the github repo about the tests failing so there's a pool request open right now pull request 33 that is being worked on so Sebastian and Kevin and Patrick are all trying to figure out what the issue is so I haven't pulled it in yet because it's not if we get it to a point where I think the problem is solved then I'll pull it in but for now just know if you were getting some errors like some timeout errors on the tests that it's we might have a fix and when I say we I mean they because they're really doing a great job on it and I've I've been working a little bit on some other stuff on here okay so let me let me just go through this quickly basically this is pretty much what fix things so if you remember we were we were trying to put this data in you know same day that pretty much this these things I added and I'll explain this in a second so with the exception of these two lines all of this is from Kevin so some things that he did have to change he had to add this content type header and then also had to encode these key value pairs so if you want to see more of an explanation of this like I said check out the pull request but that's where we're at now so that's pretty much all that changed and as far as what I did so basically without these two lines this makes a new folder and Reich but I needed to make a new project which I don't even know if I said that yet but Reich has folders projects and tasks so the highest level in the hierarchy is the the project and then within the project you can have multiple folders and multiple tasks and things so I'm actually I'm not sure how it all works so we use it as a department as a whole we write to coordinate things like a high level for my projects I use Trello it seems like right can do a lot more than Trello can but I don't need that more so it's easier for me to just do things really simply in Trello since it's usually just me and you all working on the project so anyway to make a folder I actually needed to add I'm sorry to make a project instead of a folder all you need to do is add project and then assign it an owner ID and let me I'm not going to show you the the actual variables but I'm going to change them just a bit and then show you what because I had to do a little bit of a strange thing to get it to work so let me bring this over so that y'all can see okay so this is from my dot n file it's not my entire file obviously but these are what I added here this share ID and owner ID so you can see how I had to put it put it in I actually needed to make this an array in quotes otherwise it kept saying that it was invalid and for this one I had to make an object with owner IDs and then an array with the ID that's the only way would accept it I actually attempted to put all this stuff in here and then just you know had the idea within it didn't work so probably tried I don't know maybe five different combinations of ways to do this and this was what ended up working so if you are working with the right API and you're having issues with this this is how you have to do it I do remember having similar issues when I tried to get this to work with with Ajax on the client side and so I just for that I think I had to do like some escaping of quotes and things like that but basically this is the format that Reich is looking for so not sure if any of you are actually using light right you need to do this but okay so I just got some messages on my Instagram feed that they actually evacuated my building but it looks like I see some people on the hall I think we're good so evidently there was gas in the building they did evacuate nobody seems in a hurry I'm just gonna keep going I'm sure if it's that big of a deal somebody will knock on my door and maybe we'll see actually I'm gonna check the live chat now because I have and I completely forgot to check the live chat let's see okay I still had a lot chat open from yesterday so I was looking at the wrong one for a second let me close that okay so hey everybody oh cool Gavin says hey checking in from Jamaica awesome and I also says he said day five in the series alright cool you you've remembered you said you're gonna start at the beginning of the series so you've caught up with a 5 to 5 days already so that's great shyam says total newbie when it comes to react that's cool that's cool I'm still I think I'm still somewhat of the new bit myself this is a good place I'll try to explain as much as I can thanks I am says that he'll call if I do pass out so thanks okay so Gavin says his tests are also failing locally okay so it's I mean I'm not happy to hear that other people are having problems but it's good to know that at least like it can be replicated which is good because then we could probably narrow it down it looks like some people were coming back into the building so maybe it'll be alright actually hold on one second I'm gonna ask what's going on I turn on the fan and I told the people watching me if I passed out the conference okay so the evacuation is not mandatory I think um I'm good I'm gonna stay and I'm gonna keep streaming and they said the the I guess it's from gasoline oh I'm not sure what's going on but they said it should dissipate soon so I'm slightly lightheaded right now but also I've been feeling a little weird all day like tired and stuff so if you if you see me on the Instagram feed I have like my eyes definitely look like I'm really tired so anyway yeah I was up kind of late last night working on the react course that I'm taking that Udacity course you can actually do a lot of it on your phone which is cool so I was putting the kids to sleep and on my phone doing it and then signed up just staying up and doing it which is cool I guess I'm learning Redux which is awesome but I had dreams about coding all night and I actually had a coding nightmare so I'll get I'll get to the coding it I'll tell the story this will be the last thing before I get actually get to the coding so I know I know some people are a little bit annoyed by the amount of talking I do so I I'll be done in a minute uhhuh but anyway I had a coding nightmare that that last site we worked on the cata catechol institute site that I looked at the site and somehow they had managed to change it all and do the layout with tables and they had like this weird inset border thing that just looked like it was straight out of like the 90s and totally changed the colors everything the images were like all stretched and like not the right dimensions and I was like I was freaking out so actually my wife like was trying to get me to wake up anyways she like touched me I just like jumped up I'm just like wow that was it was terrible so I guess normal people have nightmares about like I don't know like scary things like what but I have nightmares about people changing my layout to using HTML tables so anyway it looks like cool there's some discussion going on in the live chat about those errors with the test so that's awesome so thanks for like I said um I'll pull it in I mean uh if I I haven't been that involved with it one because I had never gotten any errors so if I can't replicate the issue I probably not really gonna be able to contribute that much to fixing it so also it seems like Kevin and Patrick and Sebastian are getting to the bottom of it and seems like you all are close so hey not bad I have a few people in the Instagram stream that's cool they're given some given some love and Instagram so thank you alright so let's do this let me tell you what we're gonna try to do and then then we'll do it so right now where we are is that when I hit the submit button this does make a full project in Reich and I would show you what's going on but I don't want to show you all the stuff that's that my department is working on just there's probably nothing secret in there but just in case somebody would get upset about me showing it I don't want to do it but basically it is working I was able to get a project made what happens when the project gets made is that we get data back and we get a bunch of data back you can actually see what what comes back here so I can I can atleast show you an example of what we get back so this is the response that we get when we create a new folder or project in this case we've we were actually creating a project but they send back pretty much the same thing either way and what we really need is this ID so this is the ID of the project if we have this ID then we can attach files to that project so unfortunately you can't attach the files at the same time that you send the initial data so like all our form data we actually can send initially but we have to wait until we get this ID back so we're gonna get the ID back we're gonna get this value and then we're gonna use that to attach our file so we're gonna check out attachments we want to create attachments yes okay so we'll be using this folder so there's not a separate URL for projects there I guess considered the same loves folders like I said I'm not exactly sure what what the difference is really and Reich but I just know that the people that use Reich a lot said that they would much rather have them be projects and not folders so I made them project so we're going to do basically this obviously this is not in the format that we need to put it in right this is curl but this is what we're gonna do let's see mmhmm usually they give they say like what everything is that you need to put in the in the call no they're not doing at the Sun okay well basically we'll need the same thing so we need our access token like we're like we're already the language yeah no big deal we're gonna give a file name Content ID oh here we go and then here's our attachment content so I've already done this with with Ajax so I'm going to I'm gonna show you all how I did it with Ajax cuz that'll probably be way easier to read than this curl I don't know about you but like that's not really a format for me if you're using postman you can actually copy and paste this and then convert it to whatever format you like so that's I mean you could do that if you want but since I've already done that before and converted it to be able to use it with Ajax I'll just copy that over so I do need to remove my API key from this so just a second and I will I will do that okay okay so this with Ajax accomplished what we needed so the only thing okay so here's what that project ID goes so in our our URL we just need to add to the to the end actually not to the end because then we still have this attachments here so be folders then the project ID slash attachments okay so we need to okay in our headers are bearer obviously after bear this is where our API key goes okay so I've removed that but there needs to be an API key there and then we just need to add these headers and then our data is going to be so I mean obviously this is a variable from what I'm doing on the current site so let me see I just I'm looking at the code on the other screen and like I said there's API keys in it so I can't show you as well but I'll try to bring over what I can okay I don't I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this in exactly the same way as I did so let me just show you how it was getting that all right so wow this pace over so so weird let me change this to there we go at least we get some syntax highlighting so what I was doing to get the files since this was all clientside I direct Lee had access to the Dom elements so I was getting the upload the actual upload input and then grabbing the files from that to make file lists so not really going to be able to do that so I can't exactly do what I did before but you get the idea of what we're what we're gonna try to do so the first things first is we need to be able to get this ID from the response okay so let's see we already have an example of the response which let me go back to that create folder there we go okay so this is what we need to grab inside data we need to grab ID so let's try to get that and I've forgotten my timer so let's see that as well all right so right now we are getting actually let me see I'm gonna check I'm gonna check the live check because it looks like there's something in here that's definitely relevant okay Kevin says it makes more sense in this case to put the get the attachment from the server yeah well I mean we're already you know we already have it in the server we're saving it so I agree all right so let me does I think that I I will be able to show you the response let me check it really quick to make sure that my API key is not in there okay yeah oh I will be able to bring this over then oops accidentally it's smaller instead of bigger so then make this bigger so y'all can see so this is currently what we're getting back and that it would be so we're we logging this early down here okay so here's where we do the Reich folder you're passing in the what ends up being the name of the folder project okay so we're longing it here nice let me I think this is what this is right that's why we're we're logging not this but this part right our status that we're getting back okay Sebastian says oh so you might want to limit the file types that people can upload yes I'm definitely going to do that so I'm gonna keep saying that for for myself so that I don't forget and thank you for reminding me so yeah before any of this goes live definitely need to make sure we do some some things to limit what can be uploaded or you know whatever at the very least we're gonna limit what can be uploaded I'd like to whatever reasonable steps should be taken when you handle file uploads with node I would like to take those steps so I may need to maybe maybe I'll just do some research I'm sure there's there's some stuff out there about it but let's see for now so I just want to say just can I grab it like that I don't know if that's gonna work let's see let's see what we get no not gonna be able to do it like that is that actually we're kidding that's weird how did that crash oh sorry I was still like I talked about yesterday I still have not done anything to to fix the Corsair so that I was getting and now what did I do oh that's the one right check let me close that cuz we're definitely not gonna use that I'm not gonna use this are they let me just use what I'm gonna do I can't decided I was just gonna use Firefox in Harris the it's not telling me what what the air is Oh all right what did I do okay it should have started yeah she just started it let me okay Oh syntaxerror what did I do oh it's because I tried to console and I forgot to put a plus all that because I forget to put a plus sign oh well template literals have spoiled me Oh remember to put the plus sign in okay now let's see what happens okay so that that in fact is exactly what we want all right let me check I'm gonna check the live Chad okay thanks Kevin I should have checked the live chat about six minutes ago to avoid in some of this okay so the status status right now is coming in as a string that's that's why so basically we're right here see it says text so it just wasn't thinking so I need to change it it's a JSON and now let's see what we're getting so yeah let's try this data let's see what we get there we go here's what we need all right great so look I can't believe it took what like ten minutes to get to that point about most of that was spent trying to figure out why how I messed up the server but anyway this is what we needed all right so we have the ID that we need I can get rid of this trying to think if there's value in keeping the rest of the status I really have no need of anything else in that status right now so I guess I'm okay with just pulling out this this ID okay there were a few other things about the server in the live chat so let me scan through that quickly okay Patrick says you can set the accepts property input on the front end so I can in the browser client side but you should also check on the back end to prevent people from getting around it yeah for sure so actually if you've never worked with file upload inputs before that's a really good point so basically you can set on the input itself what you want it to be able to accept but people can get around that so I guess like really easily and I don't know maybe you've done this before like you can just inspect something in dev tools and then change it change the HTML and then it will change the way that that field functions so a good example of this is like a password field so if you have a password and password field let's say like you you don't remember what the password was you can just go into dev tools take out password as the type of input and then all of a sudden you'll be able to see the string instead of those little dots so a similar thing could happen so basically doing clientside checking of what the files are and restricting the files is not enough because you can get around it easily so you want to do something on the server side as well so ideally you do both because you do it on the client side so that immediately the user gets feedback that hey you can't you can't upload that otherwise they try to upload it and depending on how you set it up potentially they might not even have any idea that there that file type is wrong so you do it on the client side basically I mean it's pretty much for user experience because people can get around it if they really want to and then on the server side that's where you're checking things and that's more for security the user never sees that they don't even have to know about it but that's where you really want to make sure that you're not gonna like execute a file it's gonna mess up your server today that's my lesson on security today okay so Patrick is giving me some advice here about how I can make the server work all right so let me share this so what how's my permission denied indicating me oh well whatever okay so let's Oh I'll worry about the the server later I guess not really big deal like right now it's knowing what I needed to do for what we're working on right now okay so just try to remember where we were all right so we have our ID next up is send the files based on that ID so we need to basically we're gonna add another another one of these and so I'm like I'm gonna copy this because a lot of its going to be the same so we're going to take in actually read it we're not taking two things right yeah so we need let me think we need the ID obviously but then we also need the files and let me see how are we getting this file objects okay all right we'll just give it to file so you don't need to we don't need so in our body basically we don't need any of this stuff we need just the just the files and okay post is fine this is the same content type it's gonna be how do we have to loop through this I I mean shake it just occurred to me that it I may only be able to send one file at a time so I'll have to loop through the files and keep sending the request so I mean that only changed slightly how we do it yeah that actually won't be a huge deal so with I guess then within actually within here might not be a bad place I mean right now all we're doing is just console logging whatever the files are so that will still console.log just to make sure that it's working but within here we could probably call like add attachments and we're gonna need actually we are we're gonna need that ID I had to be careful the order here so we're not actually so within the on end we're making that first call to Reich and then we're getting the data back and then after that is when we want to send the file otherwise we're not gonna have the right ID so this is not the place to do it then here yeah not the place to do it but I still need I wonder all right I have a few ideas I don't think the first one will work let me tell you well a few my ideas are and then I'll give everyone a minute if let me know if you think they'll work and Hut so the first idea is I just do this form on file function and I put that down here so after we get the status back just run that down here I'm thinking hey if that works that's great I'm just not sure if it'll work if I put it in here but we'll see that's probably the simplest thing the alternative would be inside of this right here where it currently is I save the files yeah so I'll save the files to a variable here and then just use that down here and pass that along with the ID I mean obviously like with within a loop like I'm I'm gonna have to call that multiple times yeah okay so those are my two ideas I guess I'll give you a minute to respond to that but the first one would be so easy to test I'm just gonna do that so I'm gonna copy and paste this and I'm just gonna put two their side don't mix it up alright so basically all I'm gonna see oh I'm looking to see is do I get anything there let's see will you need to upload a few things let's upload three files so we should have that shouldn't be called three times and that doesn't know so from right here so we had it it ran the first time and it did not run the second time okay so for whatever reason that does not run in here so I mean we could try to make that work or move on to the second one my time is up for the Pomodoro session so I am going to take five minutes and go back to the live chat all right so for now I'm looking away at the bottom just to see what would you all have to say about what I was just doing and then if I have time I'll scroll up and see if there's any questions okay Kevin says loop inside the then of the right night folder okay she's saying loop inside this then correct which is what we're gonna try to do okay kevin says it didn't work because we're we would be listening for files after the request was already parsed so since we're we were trying to do this and listen for files inside this on end right it's it's already and it's already been parsed so enough nothing's happening at this point so of course it's not gonna pick up on that so this then is definitely not gonna work so let me just remove that and move to move on to plan B all right Rohan's here hey everyone how's it going Rohan asks what did I miss basically we are we're able to go from our server Jay s file and then on Form submit make a new project in Reich and then we get back the ID of that project and we can take the ID now and we're going to attempt to use that ID to send files and attach them one by one to that that particular project okay I'm scanning really quickly to see if there any questions that I missed trick ISS asks can you tell me how to group content in HTML with div and span properly so not sure if you're still watching because that was asked quite a while ago but if you are I mean I would say properly I don't know that there's a proper way to do it it depends on what framework you're using and what you're trying to accomplish in terms of what divs and spans you use generally most of what you do is going to be in divs you know your spans are more like shorter blocks of content like within like if you if you had a paragraph for instance and one line of that paragraph or even a few words you want to add some special styling to that would be a good place to use a span but the if you had larger chunks of content then you might want to use a div generally that's how how they're used if you're using a framework like an by framework I mean like bootstrap foundation materialise they're gonna have set out how they manage the layout of the page and they're usually with a div structure so a lot of how you do your your divs is gonna be based on what that framework is already laid out so if you're doing it from scratch and you're doing everything I mean you can lay out your dues however you'd like but like I said in general if it's in line like with within you know paragraph spans work well you know a small piece of content otherwise divs are usually used you know for major layout things if you're trying to make like some cards on the page those would be divs hopefully I answer the question I said not sure here you know watching still but maybe it'll be helpful to someone but anymore I always use some sort of CSS framework so the structure of the divs is basically already decided hi Gavin I just saw the comment he said it sounds weird hearing my voice at normal speed because you've been catching up it always sounds weird when I hear my own voice on these things probably it doesn't matter what speed it is it's always weird okay so my timers up I did get about halfway through checking the questions so all of them go back up we'll do another Pomodoro session here and then I'll answer some questions so hey Mark's here hey how's it going you you still still looked in the new job is it going well let me know I haven't I haven't heard about it in a while alright so it looks like cool Kevin has put some some code in the live chat that will most likely do what we're trying to try to do here let's see Kevin always has good code so I'm confident that assuming that I can paste this in the right spot it will work so let me just paste this it's really hard to like read out code so let me paste this in here so y'all can see what I'm saying so basically okay so pretty much what we were basically this is the club code to make like plan B work so we have a files where files and we're going to save the files to this so then we can access it later on even within this form on end and yeah and then we leave this leave this where it is right because it won't work otherwise all right so it's I'll put it up here at some point I'll probably remove this because I won't need the console.log the files but I it would be good for troubleshooting to leave it in at least for now okay probably actually don't need the name in there but I was even in for now okay so same thing that's going on here except instead of console logging we are adding the files to this array so files push file right okay then and since we'll have all the files in this array when we get down to here we can oh yeah okay yeah down to here so we get down to here we will have gotten the ID back right so we can get the ID from here and then we can call our function that's going to attach the file but we will want to loop over that all right yes okay files use coded files right can we do map on this I know it was confused a couple days ago about trying to use a map on things that you shouldn't use map on but it's an array right so we can use map so file add attachments and it's gonna be ID all right so now up here all right here we go yeah okay yeah that's the right order for now let me get rid of this and I just want to so I should be able to get the file name out of that so let's make sure that this works ideas not defined oh I'm sure you've already seen the mistake that I made but what I I just use ID and instead of actually getting the ID here so what I need is this there we go now let's give it a shot whoops file was not defined oh because I was saying files and we're not sending files were only sending one file at a time so better to name it file anyway okay there we go okay awesome so it's working in the sense that it is calling it the correct number of times for each file and we're getting data on a different file each time so in this case we just console.log the name but we have you know the whole object there it is correctly giving us the ID as well great so that's what we need to work with now we just need to use the right format to send this I forgot to start that again awesome so I commented out this bit here also we'll probably I mean we're not gonna want to run this like if there's no if there are no files so we'll probably want to check first to see if there's file but for now I'm not worried about that I just want to get it to work and then I can check okay so I had started to put in what I needed here and then I I don't know what got me sidetracked but I dropped down and started doing some things down below there so now we need to okay so we're sending we're not gonna send files anymore we just want the one file so in the background my music today is some really like mellow jazz it's the coffee table jazz station on Spotify so you have to let me know do I seem like more relaxed and mellow am i coating better than normal or not usually I listen to way more upbeat music like electronic music and stuff so I'm kind of interested to see what would affect different types of music have on my coding not really very scientific can't really keep all the factors the same from you know each time I code but you'll see okay so Kevin said it's it's fine to not check for their files because if there are no files the loop would just run zero times yeah that makes sense this cool all right well we have actually a really low viewer count today not sure what's going on maybe maybe I am really really boring today because I'm I'm too mellow because I'm listening to the Jess anyway I'm not really sure what if it causes people to view or not view some days there's a lot of people in some days there's not and I'm doing the same thing pretty much every day alright so we need here on the other side this is what we need so let's add in headers content yeah oops and we can get filed me contenttype oh now I remember why I went down cuz when I looked at this and these two I realized oh we're only sending one file at a time and that's when I started thinking about how we can get one file at a time okay oops I think that's what it is we'll find out awesome and okay so instead of data we have body okay and file will work all right so this looks oh we need the URL to be different so I need the ID in there so I'm gonna I'm not gonna use an environment variable I'm going to use a template literal and with the ID and then attachments great all right that should be enough actually I don't know I'm not really sure if I need these we'll try it without it but I guess we'll see we'll see how it goes okay so let's see okay so when we hit submit this time it should create a project in Reich with the title of tests it's not gonna have any data in there because I'm not we're not actually putting any data in there right now it might have actually we will it'll just say folder description as the the body of you know the project will get the ID back and then it will add probably we'll just do the same three image files will get added to that and I will verify that on my other screen where I have reich open so I'll be able oh man well yeah we actually just made a ton of test folders so I bet our project manager is wondering what's going on so anyway whoa let me delete quickly all the tests folders we have now so I don't have to search through them to find which one is the one we want to look at there's no batch delete option and that's unfortunate because I have a lot of testing so I guess Reich recently came out with a desktop app which is kind of cool but also not not really great because I had thought that one of the first desktop apps that I would try to make once I finally learned how to make desktop apps with react would be a Reich desktop client for my my department but they already beat me to it so I guess it's cool either way we have it I just thought it would be cool to do but anyway let's give this a try now so I've deleted out all the other tests that we made whoa crash what'd I do oops I put at least I remember just to check this I D is not defined where Oh why is ID not defined we're getting an ID okay that's why all right let's give it a shot all right so I've seen the project has been created and awesome let me see did the file go through Oh No okay so the project was created the file the correct file names came through but when I try to click on them it says the file appears to be invalid or broken sorry we can't load it so I did something wrong but so here's what we know is working which the good news is we know that it is actually getting the ID back and it's sending in this case three requests so it's sending a request for each file that we've we've uploaded which is great the correct file name is getting there the only thing is the file itself is not working which I didn't really check what let's see so I'm sending this okay I'm not sure why that happened let's take a look so we're getting the file scroll down here okay so here's your eating the files from on file okay so the files here all right let me let me check the live chat to see what y'all think okay Patrick says for each would be more appropriate okay cool I'll change that to four each Rohan says I need upbeat slash EDM or something similar for me to get to do anything yeah this morning I don't know what it was I was listening to some like really upbeat electronic music and I don't know I was just feeling weird and was feeling like I don't know like a little bit like I was getting a headache and I couldn't focus and I thought like I don't know like maybe I just need to chill a little bit so I so I did so I relaxed a little bit I put my feet up on my desk and just listen to some jazz for a bit and I started feeling better so that's why I went with it but like 90 probably 95% of the time I do this in the upbeat music Oh okay Kevin I just saw your message about the contenttype is that's what what's messing this up actually that makes sense maybe the contenttype is doing that so what maybe this isn't where I need to get let's see file type now actually that it that is it it is tight that's what I need it's twice oh okay that that makes sense good good either okay cool I'm I'm actually really happy about that because that that was probably our a problem and otherwise I was a little bit at a loss as to what could the issue could be all right is even another shot okay no errors let's check it out hmm actually I got the same problem as I did the last time this do the order does the order matter here I'm not sure if the order matters but I guess when I did it over here where did I have it at no I had it here so it shouldn't matter I think what's going on I just want to see what we're actually getting and we do this okay that that seems like the right type right try content type application okay let's try okay so let's check out so in the example reusing oops this is not it in the example it's using this is the content type so let's give that a shot same thing same issue okay so I actually downloaded the file from Reich just to see what would happen so yeah it won't be damn it she's a file format preview doesn't recognize okay see okay right now I'm just kind of looking over the code and seeing if I can see something and think of something that that we're missing here I wonder if they're looking for something like we had had done before so actually no we didn't end up doing that I'm sorry I was thinking about one of the possible solutions to this and I think what I was thinking I've ended up not working anyway well we we got pretty far without hitting a really serious issue so it's not bad I do want to see the times yeah I want to give this working so this stream may end up being a bit long but I have an appointment at 500 p.m. which is its Eastern time so I can definitely go for Fri another hour so let's say let's give this issue like a half hour and that would leave a half hour for questions probably won't need that long but you never know maybe we'll need it and I say that just because there's not a whole lot of viewers right now so let's let's try anyway so we got about a half hour about another we'll do one more Pomodoro session to work on this problem we'll take our five minutes to do a little some some questions and catch up in the kinda live chat I'm just right now I'm just going through right now making sure I didn't misspell anything okay just checking to see like the files that we are getting are being uploaded and they work so something something's happening and we really transfer the files then all right well yeah I figured that Sophia all right so now's a good time to take a break usually when I get stuck like this if I do take a little break it's usually I'll get some idea at least something new to try so I'm gonna go back to the live chat I'm gonna scroll up to where I left off at before and try to get to any questions or see if I missed anything and then in five minutes we'll go back to this problem at this point honestly I don't have any ideas for what to try next so hopefully I think of something now we got a few more viewers it was actually we're down to sixteen viewers I saw at one point which is crazy we're never that low so I don't know what's going on the only times we've been this little before is once the YouTube notifications weren't it just people didn't get them a lot of people didn't get them and then the other time I was trying to stream during some big tech conference and the tech conference was livestreaming and I didn't realize it so other than that we usually have more people than this all right where'd I leave love okay alright see there's still a lot of discussion about this there's Aires okay cool so it looks like Gavin was able to get the test to pass so that's that's cool good to hear that okay Patrick and Rohan I see I see everything you're saying about trying to get the the localhost 3000 to work so oh they said I'll try that out later on today or maybe early tomorrow haha now I said I see how many times you all were trying to tell me that I had contenttype in there twice sorry I didn't I didn't look over and see that thanks for continuing to try to try to remind me about that okay Joseph said that that that actually works so basically the way that we're doing it up here worked for you and postman so I wonder what's going on no page John Hanson said finally I caved and installed create react app so over the last oh I don't I don't even know how long John's been working with react but trying to set up react and web pack and everything from scratch so he finally went with create react app which if you're not familiar with that that lets you kind of bootstrap react project and get started without having to know anything about web pack so alright cool let me know how it goes then at least you can get started and start doing react stuff and not worrying about your build okay John John Hanson said that he got his YouTube notification exactly on time so maybe it's not the YouTube stuff who knows what it is oh wow okay so Patrick's and YouTube notifications haven't been on time in a month sometimes he gets notified the next day wow that's crazy kayvon I'm not I'm not sure how you how to pronounce that exactly that what syllable to put the emphasis on but I'm gonna say kayvon and then because we have a Kevin's I'm gonna try to differentiate that but is asking if I use Redux so I did not use Redux for this project but probably be using Redux in a future project because I'm learning it right now so I'm taking a course from Udacity on redux so I was working on it earlier today on my lunch break so Redux will be coming most likely as soon as I get done with this course and I get a project where it would make sense to use redux okay so that was I've gotten to the to the end of the live chat and I've also gotten to the end of that break so let's give it one more Pomodoro cycle and give it a shot try to get this to work and we'll see so basically like everything is working just how we want it I mean we obviously we need to finetune things before this would be ready to go you know in a live situation but basically everything's working except the files won't go through properly it's in terms of like it won't open we get the file name it shows up as if it's a file but when you click on it it says the file appears to be invalid or broken so let's try I'd like to try maybe this is try a different file type so I have this xcf file and see if that works mmm and actually that's weird that did not get through at all I mean let me show you again let's refresh show it one more time that's odd it's actually it is creating when I do that it's creating new projects but it's trying to add those three there we go finally for for some reason when I try that the first two times it was trying to add the same three files again really weird all right so let's see it looks like it did the same thing for this as well I'm gonna download it and open it up just just to be sure well there we go and it said it cannot open the image all right so definitely doesn't matter what type it is all right so I guess now it's time to do a little bit of research then and maybe I can try I'm sure either either stackoverflow or we're gonna go to NBN's documentation on file files let's see okay got some stuff so that's a good sign let's see I'll pull this over and let's see this so nothing obviously with Reiki API alright so I got a few up here let's see what's going on okay a lot of less ones for this let's see doesn't seem to be fixed all right let's try another one let's see if that won't ever get fixed okay so this is we are using SendGrid and our files actually might not maybe we can try I don't want to try it right now but if we can't figure anything else else out maybe we could try to send the file as an attachment to our emails that we're sending through SendGrid and see if we can get it to work through there maybe that I mean at least maybe we could rule rule some things out maybe but let's see what's the all right that's not going to be helpful all right I'm not sure okay so it was false broken okay not really anything there that's useful okay no answers for that one all right let me check and the live chat here looks like there's a few things okay so Kevin I see your comments let's try them out I'm going to try to do some debugging okay all right let's see what we're getting there that's odd which should it be I guess that's it's close enough I was thrown off by the type right but I guess that's what is supposed to be okay so kevin says formidable files don't appear to be noted buffers which note fetch handles well so maybe reading the file directly from the path with FS read file to get an actual buffer okay so let's see I'm gonna need some help so see where so where am I gonna do where am I gonna put FS da tree file are we talking like where we somewhere in here where we're grabbing the files the project managers sent me a message on slack and said dude I'm getting like a test email every minute from you yes this is happening okay so let's try to put okay so can I do something like this on this this file before we send it over or do I need to put it higher up guys this we're talking this is we're talking about here okay not there that's so Patrick had a good idea that I could just set up a free bike account to use for testing then I can show you all what's going on and I won't spam everyone else with this stuff that's a great idea she was excited that when I told her I'm working on the new version of the Resource Center so don't think it's that it's that big of a deal but it would be cool to be able to show you what it looks like okay let's see I suppose you said path to an upload directory file where all right so I see Kevin and Patrick are putting some code in the live chat for me but all right so I'm a little bit confused all let me paste this up here so everyone can see I'll get rid of this stuff all right so kevin has posted this and Patrick this and I'll have to wait a minute there's a look there's a delay on the video so I'll have to wait a second to get a response here so so I could put this okay John Hanson said I'm confused too thanks for saying that Jonah it makes me feel better I'm not the only one that's that's confused yeah Kevin and Patrick you guys are awesome and so I don't you're just like both of you are so knowledgeable and I think you're just like steps ahead of me all the time so it takes me a minute or two to catch up and figure out where you all are at okay so we it looks like we have a better way than to do this so let me show you the latest okay so if it's rifo so this is going to go then we're in in here or do I need to put this inside here instead of okay patched it inside the files thought map which should be files thought for each okay yeah I never changed the Fourier so each is it file of files or file in files I can't remember which one it is we'll see see if it works okay this in all right thanks Ron I don't know I don't smell the gas anymore here but I'm definitely feeling lightheaded maybe I'm just used to it I can't even smell it anywhere oh okay cool Patrick says I can just do files that or yeah where my follows up for each and then well let's cool all right so now I'm going to put that in here and then get rid of this portion of it and this portion yeah okay that's great okay so we have files for each ferry foul I think this is what you're trying to tell me so I mean just check this out okay so instead of the file we're sending this buffer all right okay so we need the file name header which so okay so that's not I can't get the name anymore from that so maybe I should just pass in I mean I know I can get it on the of ik so I guess I could pass in a name and tight oh this is a good sign look at that file size I'm feeling good about this one let's check it out I'm trying to find which one is the the right one cuz they're all just named test there we go all right it works yay let me see I can show you I'll show you a little bit of it basically I'll just zoom in and hide all the stuff that I'm not sure whether or not I should show just because it's exciting that it finally works so here we go check it out so anyway Liz sorry I'm putting your name out on YouTube but there we go there's our files and there's our our project tests folder description here and our files so just in time this just went off right after we get it to work so that's awesome I'm excited I'm happy let's just really quick kind of go over what we did that made it work and definitely thanks to Patrick and Kevin for figuring this one out because I was I had obviously tried everything that I could think of at the moment so let's go so basically the the what we did different then was instead of sending you know whatever this file was that we were sending and we used FS read file and we were able to get the buffer and put that in there so I'm not familiar with with this FS rifo I'm not familiar enough to explain in any more depth than that why it worked but just hang if you're trying to use a similar setup which sometimes people are sometimes I get messages from people that say like that they've cloned my repo and then they're modifying and using it for their project so if you're trying to do something similar this is the fix probably want to read up more on exactly what's going on here so I'm lazy I'm not gonna attempt to explain it because I don't I don't know enough to feel comfortable explaining how this works I've never used it but that was the solution and awesome yes I'm celebrating going on there in the in the live chat so yeah really awesome it's it's great whenever we can get things working figure it out so alright so I'm gonna go now and do some question and an answer here in a minute so if you're just here for the code that portion is done otherwise you're going to stick around for question answers put your questions and the live chat now and I'll try to answer them you could also ask me questions on any social media channels and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can I will say this I have I'm a little bit behind on the YouTube comments on getting to them all so I've just been obviously really busy between work and then some side project work that I have for clients and the Udacity course and then my wife and four kids it's it's pretty busy so I do I try to get to the comments I've seen some of them and just not really had time to give you a good answer so I I'm not ignoring you so if you're waiting on me to reply comment I'll try to get to it whenever I can so anyway before I get to the questions just quick recap of where we are and where we need to go so from this point we can get data from our form that data can then get emailed it can get sent to a project management system along with the file uploads our file uploads are also getting saved to our uploads folder so what we need to do then is actually send the data that a user uploads through the form okay so from all those text inputs and check boxes okay so we need to send that format it in a way that's somewhat decent so that it shows up in a readable way in our project management system in our and in our emails and then we need to put some sort of security measures in place to limit what gets uploaded what type of files get uploaded probably want to limit the size of the uploads as well I I suppose could get crazy if you know we get a really huge people trying to upload a lot of really huge files so probably want to do a limit on the number of files that can be uploaded at any one time and also the size that any one file can be let me think and I guess that's it for the forum the only other thing we had talked about doing that I'm still not sure about is having some sort of database to store this data or possibly sending the at least the data from the text fields and checkboxes to a Google sheet just to have a backup somewhere so still not sure about those may or may not happen we'll see and then other than that we do have one other forum that's going to be a very simple form to deal with no file uploads just a few text fields and we just have some UI stuff you know some basic things probably the only difficult I won't even say difficult the the most difficult thing that will have to deal with after this is our images because we're gonna want you'll see I'll show you in an upcoming stream but our images are using isotope so I don't if you ever worked with isotope before but a JavaScript library that's called isotope and I can't remember if it depends on jQuery or not so we'll see but we'll try to do something similar with react and see what we can get all right so now I'm gonna go to the live chat and let's see yang Jian Xiao says I'm new here it seems like I'm at the end hi yeah you are you are at the end so yeah sorry about that but you will yeah as I'm Berto says you'll be able to see the recording so you thanks for for joining in though and thanks for for saying hi in the live chat hopefully you can make a live stream in the future at some point okay so I have okay so okay Danny see Danny says thanks for answering my questions on Instagram awesome yeah you're welcome no problem so yeah as I say I'm on lots of different social media things and I'm I'm happy to answer whatever you know questions and things that you that you have let's see she she Jun says hi hey how's it going thanks for for joining in so I'm gonna scroll up a bit I did get through most of the live shot already so I won't have to scroll up too much but I want to just double check make sure I didn't miss any questions okay I'm Blair tail has some some helpful tip here it says one small editor thing that I use a lot in Visual Studio that works in Adam just different keystroke if you want to move blocks of code up or down select the lines and push control arrow keys instead of cut paste okay cool I see I'm gonna try that so I don't know if I don't know if you gave me the keystrokes to do it in Visual Studio or an atom but I'm gonna try it so ctrl arrow keys alright that didn't work this rectum I know okay so different yeah different in atom so I'll have to see what it is an atom but that yeah that actually will be helpful to me so thank you for that now billion says you sound like Remi Malik that's cool I've never had anybody say that before but I'll take it I'll take it I like I like him Umberto's says I love mr. robot yeah so Remi Malick is the the guy the actor that plays the lead character on the show mr. robot so actually I watch season 1 and then a few episodes into season 2 so yeah it was it was pretty cool it was really interesting just just I don't know to hear about all like the different like hacker stuff and how they do things it was pretty interesting although I haven't seen anybody that's watched after like season basically from the end of season 1 on is it still good like is it should I try to watch the second season then I mean season 1 was pretty good okay so maybe it's different on a Mac to do let's see let me try it again yeah and then I tried command I tried control yeah while controls doing crazy stuff on my other screens let's try option no not option no yeah not really sure it's probably some combination command command control oh cool Joseph awesome thank you so Joseph came through with the correct so if you want to do this which actually looks really cool now that I'm doing it on a Mac on Adam on a Mac you use command control and then your up and down arrow keys that's really cool I like that and for a single line you don't need to select anything yeah let's try that oh nice check that out don't even a select so that was that came from Kevin thanks Kevin that's really cool alright rohan says season two of mr. robot is good alright awesome so it is just season two season three have they had a season three yet all right well I've gotten to the end of the live chat this has been over to our streams so I'd say now is the decent place to to stop okay cool it's I guess season 3 mr. robots coming out in October alright cool good to know off to check it out and see the last time I checked on Amazon Prime video they only had season 1 but maybe though maybe they'll have season tution since season 3 is coming up but I think that's that's about it for today I'm actually pretty exhausted I don't know if it's all the gas streams that I've breathed in today if you're confused by that watch the beginning so or just in general being tired or you know exhausted from all the code but it was pretty cool we definitely accomplished what we wanted to accomplish today thanks to to your help and so tomorrow I'm not exactly sure we'll be doing tomorrow whether we'll try to polish this a little bit more or move on to something different we'll see but thank you so much for watching and for for all the help and the live chat I really appreciate that I will be back tomorrow and probably same time I haven't checked my schedule yet but probably at 200 p.m. Eastern Time and we'll work on this a little bit more so until then have a great day
