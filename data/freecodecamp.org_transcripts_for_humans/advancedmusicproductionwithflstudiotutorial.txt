00:00 - learn advanced music production with FL
00:03 - Studio in this course from Tristan
00:05 - Wilcox Tristan is a professional music
00:07 - producer with over 10,000 hours in music
00:10 - production in this course you'll learn
00:12 - complex techniques that will transform
00:14 - your approach to cing music Tristan
00:16 - covers everything from mastering plugins
00:17 - and sound design to understanding the
00:20 - subtle differences between being a music
00:22 - artist and a music producer in my first
00:25 - FL Studio beginner tutorial I taught you
00:27 - guys how to make your very first
00:28 - beginner track and I didn't assume that
00:30 - you knew anything I basically did the
00:32 - tutorial as if you had never heard of
00:34 - anything music production related and
00:35 - that you've never seen the software
00:36 - before in this tutorial I'm going to be
00:38 - assuming that you have made your own
00:40 - songs before you have been using FL
00:41 - Studio and if you're coming here for the
00:43 - first time and you do want to learn
00:44 - music production but you don't know
00:46 - anything about it yet I would highly
00:48 - suggest that you go watch some uh good
00:50 - beginnner tutorials and I have made a
00:52 - very in-depth one that is also on this
00:53 - channel so if you watch that one first
00:55 - You' be uh greatly prepped for uh this
00:57 - one once you want a more advanced
00:59 - in-depth look with this tutorial what
01:00 - I'm going to be doing is it's going to
01:02 - go a little bit differently um and
01:04 - rather than make a track uh because
01:07 - tracks that are in my estimation like
01:09 - Advanced I put in 40 to 50 hours into
01:12 - any given track and obviously that would
01:13 - be just a little bit too long for a full
01:15 - length YouTube production and while I
01:18 - hope I could record that one day I think
01:19 - the editing would be extremely tedious
01:22 - so uh for now what I'm going to do is
01:23 - I'm actually just going to go over some
01:25 - categories of Advanced Techniques that I
01:27 - think I could cover in a more realistic
01:29 - time frame so you guys can still get the
01:31 - benefits of having an advanced knowledge
01:32 - of music production without uh the price
01:35 - tag of having to watch something that
01:36 - would actually take that that
01:39 - [Music]
01:42 - length um something to know and this is
01:44 - going to be the very first thing so even
01:46 - if you don't watch the rest of this
01:47 - tutorial you at least get one of
01:48 - probably the most valuable tip you'll
01:50 - get um or you know what I'll give you
01:52 - two you're lucky today um the first one
01:54 - is that uh you have to love the process
01:56 - of music production if you don't like it
01:58 - you're never going to be a a truly
02:00 - Advanced producer or an artist in my
02:02 - estimation um my definition of an artist
02:05 - um I don't know what the actual
02:06 - definition is I should probably look it
02:07 - up but the one that I have written down
02:09 - here is that an artist is someone who
02:11 - can take a story idea or emotion and
02:13 - express it through sound um and I know
02:15 - it sounds extremely basic but the idea
02:16 - is that I have some idea or some pattern
02:19 - in my mind and I can like I have it
02:21 - there and I want to get it from here to
02:23 - onto the screen like that's that's what
02:24 - I want to do or I guess into the
02:26 - headphones not on the screen but you get
02:28 - the point and the software is just
02:29 - helping me accomplish that task so that
02:31 - is what I think an artist is a music
02:33 - producer the difference between music
02:35 - producer and artist a music producer
02:36 - just knows how to use the software okay
02:37 - and that's not anything too remarkable
02:39 - like anybody can learn anything with
02:40 - enough time and effort making music is a
02:42 - completely different thing and I think
02:44 - that that's why I'm really happy the
02:45 - first beginner tutorial I decided to
02:47 - teach you guys how to make music because
02:48 - that's different than learning music
02:49 - production you see what I'm saying so
02:51 - that's one tip is that if you don't know
02:53 - the differences between music production
02:55 - and actually being a music artist you
02:57 - might be trying to develop the wrong
02:58 - things uh so for for instance like if
03:00 - you just think oh I just need to learn
03:02 - more of about music production and then
03:03 - I'll be a better artist I mean you could
03:05 - be sending yourself on an infinite
03:07 - Journey that you'll never finish because
03:08 - being a better artist is a completely
03:10 - different skill set than being a music
03:11 - producer um it's about what the what can
03:14 - make you better at getting the ideas
03:16 - from your head on into the program
03:17 - rather than learning more about the
03:19 - program so yeah that's that's one thing
03:22 - the second thing and it does have to do
03:24 - with uh loving the process is that you
03:26 - want to constantly be asking yourself
03:28 - questions in life the like the what is
03:31 - it called um just adding things you're
03:33 - like oh this would sound cool if I did
03:35 - it like this or what if I use this like
03:37 - this or what if I use this in a way
03:38 - that's not supposed to be used or just
03:40 - you're trying new things you're trying
03:41 - to like uh you're always constant
03:44 - basically you're having fun that's
03:45 - that's basically what I'm trying to say
03:46 - you're having fun while making music if
03:47 - you're not having fun while you're
03:48 - making music then if it's not enjoyable
03:52 - I it's going to be really hard to make
03:53 - something good out of it and if even if
03:54 - you do make something that's a good
03:56 - production it may not really have an
03:58 - emotional connection with the listeners
04:00 - so those are two things that I think
04:01 - that already will help you just speed up
04:03 - the process of you becoming Advanced
04:04 - producer because if you spend time
04:06 - working developing skills that you don't
04:07 - need obviously that's going to waste
04:09 - your time so you want to be focused on
04:11 - exactly what you want if you want to
04:12 - just do music production you don't care
04:13 - too much about making your own music
04:15 - then sure learn the software as much as
04:17 - you possibly can but if you're looking
04:18 - to become an artist that's more the
04:19 - people I'm talking to because that's the
04:21 - Practical use for why you'd want to
04:23 - learn to make music in the first place
04:24 - so with that being said uh let's get
04:27 - into some more um advanced music
04:29 - production techniques that can help you
04:30 - as an
04:33 - artist so uh first things first I'm just
04:35 - going to show you guys um something
04:38 - pretty cool if I open up basically any
04:40 - plugin here um and by the way I'm using
04:42 - all free plugins so you guys can
04:43 - completely follow along with me if I
04:45 - just open up fidal for instance this is
04:47 - a great synthesizer if you guys are
04:48 - familiar with serum this is a very
04:50 - similar synth and it's completely free
04:51 - and I think it's I think it's amazing so
04:53 - if I just click on the plugin here and
04:55 - then just contr L this is a I'd say this
04:57 - is an intermediate technique but uh if
04:59 - you click control L it automatically
05:01 - puts it on the mixer as you can see it
05:02 - names it for you and it colors it and
05:04 - puts it on the nearest mixer that isn't
05:07 - already taken
05:08 - so and obviously the reason of why this
05:11 - is useful is is immediately evident if
05:13 - you've ever used F studio for organizing
05:15 - because what happens is you're like okay
05:19 - well I have to go here and then I have
05:21 - to go to my channel rack and I have to
05:22 - put it on a mixer and then once I get it
05:24 - on that mixer I have to rename the mixer
05:26 - and you have to do all this stuff but
05:27 - just doing control L it does it all for
05:29 - you so I mean obviously that's going to
05:30 - be faster a lot more efficient so right
05:32 - there that's just going to help you keep
05:34 - track of where your instruments are and
05:35 - where they are in your mix so just an
05:37 - organizational tip right there um the
05:40 - second thing is is that um and this is
05:42 - just uh for all those people who wanted
05:43 - a sound design course you're welcome I'm
05:45 - going to go over the basics of sound
05:46 - design uh because I didn't do that in my
05:48 - beginner course and I think that a lot
05:49 - of you were interested in that so uh
05:51 - let's focus on the basic principles that
05:53 - will underly basically all music
05:55 - production uh sound design your attack
05:58 - delay sustain and release okay now
06:02 - attack uh basically this is think of
06:04 - this as a volume over time okay so what
06:06 - does that mean well for example why
06:08 - don't we just play the note and see what
06:11 - happens you can see that we can follow
06:13 - this line and see what's going on so the
06:15 - it's almost like a graph so the higher
06:17 - on the graph the more volume the lower
06:19 - on the graph the less volume further to
06:21 - the left is closest to us in time and
06:23 - then further to the right would be in
06:25 - the future so you can see what what's
06:28 - happening over time to the the volume of
06:30 - the sound so what attack is going to do
06:32 - you can almost visualize it in your head
06:34 - but also explain it can help uh you can
06:36 - see that it's going to start off lower
06:37 - volume go up in high volume and then
06:38 - come back
06:39 - down okay so that's what attack does
06:42 - Decay you can see how it affects the
06:44 - tail of the
06:46 - sound you can see the sustain is going
06:49 - to you might be like what what does this
06:51 - do let's
06:55 - see okay so if you hold the note the
06:57 - sustain actually will hold it at this
06:59 - volume it will never go lower than the
07:01 - than the what whatever this is saying is
07:03 - at it'll hold it at that volume until
07:04 - you let go of the note when you let go
07:06 - of the note the tail at the end this
07:08 - little
07:10 - release that's what happens after I let
07:12 - go of the note the rest of it that plays
07:13 - is your release so what this is
07:15 - typically called is your adsr attack
07:18 - Decay sustain and release and sometimes
07:20 - you have some extra ones like hold hold
07:22 - is an extra one that's not on all
07:23 - synthesizers but it is on some and then
07:25 - delay which is uh your more fancy
07:26 - synthesizers will have this not all of
07:28 - them do um and obviously you can see
07:30 - kind of based off of what it did to the
07:31 - visual you can tell what it would do
07:33 - like soundwise but if you can just know
07:36 - this you can make all kinds of sounds so
07:37 - first of all I can make
07:39 - pluck or I guess chords uh if I want to
07:42 - move the attack down I can make more
07:44 - [Music]
07:46 - pluck if I wanted more of a chord I
07:48 - could add a little bit of attack and
07:50 - then maybe a little bit more
07:51 - Decay if I wanted to add a more Super
07:55 - thing you could have it have high
07:58 - sustain so so there's lots of options
08:00 - here um and depending on which genre
08:02 - you're making it's going to affect the
08:03 - adsr of the sounds that you're actually
08:04 - using so for instance synth wave they
08:06 - have like very long release a very long
08:08 - Su or very high sustain and kind of hard
08:11 - attack so it's like a very lengthy drawn
08:13 - out
08:16 - stuff also I don't know music theory so
08:19 - don't judge my piano playing skills um
08:21 - so basically that's that's the
08:22 - fundamental that's the most fundamental
08:25 - sound production I can give you the
08:26 - second part is we have our uh oscillator
08:29 - so oscillator is going to be What wave
08:32 - table it's playing over and over and
08:33 - over again so um if you click the 2D and
08:35 - 3D you can see the different views of
08:37 - the oscillator so I have this let's go
08:39 - to a different one so I can show you
08:40 - guys really what's going on here so
08:42 - that's the 3D view I mean that's the 2D
08:45 - this is the 3D view it's scrolling
08:46 - through the through the thing and then
08:49 - this is the uh side view it's pretty
08:52 - cool it it kind of shows you what is
08:54 - happening to the wave table as you
08:55 - scroll through it and just scrolling
08:56 - through it I just left click and drag up
08:58 - down or you can drag this not so uh
09:01 - let's just do some basic sound design
09:02 - things so this let's make
09:05 - a more of a synth wav is excuse me let's
09:10 - make more of a synth wav is uh type
09:12 - thing so let's use this wave table
09:13 - because it looks pretty cool and I'm
09:16 - going to start here I'm going to drag
09:17 - this envelope you see this is envelope
09:19 - one the one that we're working on if I
09:21 - go to a different tab it's going to
09:22 - change so it's like envelope one drag it
09:26 - onto this uh the thing that was changing
09:28 - the wave tape
09:29 - okay so now what
09:35 - happens it's pretty interesting so it's
09:37 - actually taking the input of this and
09:40 - applying it to this um what's it called
09:42 - this um knob so you can do this All and
09:45 - by changing this knob right here it
09:47 - changes the
09:54 - way you can see how I'm using the the
09:58 - attack uh okay hold on let me say this
10:00 - correctly the envelope of this is sh is
10:03 - working on this knob in the exact same
10:05 - pattern okay and it's basically changing
10:08 - the the wave table so it's it's one of
10:10 - those things that like more of like
10:12 - after you do things a lot you kind of
10:14 - know what they do and what you're trying
10:15 - to accomplish but it's harder to explain
10:17 - like in words what's going on and
10:18 - honestly I think that the wordy
10:20 - definitions aren't the most useful
10:21 - things in mustion anyways it's just like
10:23 - hey here's this technique you can use
10:24 - this and learn it so uh without overe
10:26 - explaining everything uh another thing
10:28 - you can do is if you turn this knob the
10:30 - opposite direction and this works in a
10:32 - lot of these type of plugins uh is it'll
10:34 - actually go the opposite way
10:46 - so okay so we have some cool there I'm
10:48 - going to turn up the Unison so what this
10:50 - is going to do is it's going to play the
10:51 - same uh the same wave table multiple
10:54 - times at different uh slightly different
10:56 - painting and slightly different uh
10:58 - pitches
11:02 - and by dragging down the dtune it's
11:03 - dragging down the panning and the uh the
11:05 - tuning of the separate wave tables to be
11:08 - closer together uh less detuned and less
11:11 - further right and
11:14 - left so we have something like that so
11:17 - right off the bat we just have one one
11:20 - uh what is it called wave table playing
11:22 - with just a little just one envelope
11:24 - okay now you could see how you get so
11:26 - complicated with music production
11:27 - because you could add another uh another
11:30 - wave table here you could add another
11:31 - oscillator playing a different wave
11:33 - table and that could have its own
11:34 - envelope so I could have this have a
11:36 - completely different envelope put that
11:38 - on maybe the the
11:40 - [Music]
11:57 - volume
12:01 - you can see just by using different
12:03 - envelopes and different things you can
12:04 - come up with completely uh really
12:06 - interesting uh like sounds just by
12:09 - adding multiple oscillators and multiple
12:11 - uh envelopes and you don't need to get
12:13 - that complicated uh you can make really
12:14 - good sounds just with one just like I
12:15 - was showing you before so even just with
12:17 - this uh we're just in the oscillator
12:19 - section right here of vital and there's
12:21 - lots of things you can work with this
12:22 - there's
12:24 - filters and these filters you can also
12:26 - automate with the envelope so like
12:28 - basically just think of this you can
12:29 - drag this envelope anywhere you can drag
12:31 - a lot of these knobs like all over the
12:33 - place and just be automating and
12:35 - changing everything over time and do
12:36 - some crazy stuff and you might be
12:38 - extremely overwhelmed but the fun part
12:40 - is it's all just experimenting and
12:42 - seeing what stuff does and what sounds
12:43 - good and then over time just by messing
12:45 - around and having that Spirit of I want
12:47 - to see what this does and it might break
12:49 - my project over and over again you'll
12:50 - start to very slowly see the connections
12:53 - between different plugins and see the
12:55 - see the patterns in them so I don't
12:57 - think it's really helpful for me to go
12:58 - through every what every single thing in
13:00 - this plugin does but rather give you the
13:01 - principles that allow you to go through
13:02 - many different plugins and understand
13:04 - the basics of each of them so the first
13:06 - uh principle that we went over was
13:07 - attack Decay sustain and release uh the
13:09 - second that we went through was the idea
13:11 - of wave tables that change over time um
13:14 - obviously our basic Unison and uh Dune
13:17 - and then we have pitch which is pretty
13:18 - self-explanatory he's just going to
13:19 - change the p uh pitch up a note and then
13:22 - this is like the fine tuning of pitch
13:24 - and then uh our level which is just
13:25 - going to be the amplitude of the of the
13:27 - signal uh I showed you that we can add
13:29 - in different uh oscillators and wave
13:31 - tables that you can even apply filters
13:33 - before it goes to the effects and last
13:35 - but not least I guess I'll show you the
13:36 - voices over here so in the bottom right
13:37 - hand corner uh as you can see you can
13:39 - change the amount of voices that are
13:40 - playing so if I or I mean that are
13:42 - allowed to play so if I just play one
13:44 - and I try playing another note it's
13:46 - going to switch to that note and it
13:47 - won't let me play chords anymore because
13:49 - the max amount of voices I'm allowing is
13:51 - one which means that it's going to be
13:52 - just a lead instrument you might say
13:54 - Tristan why would you want to do this
13:55 - well suppose I want to have my notes
13:57 - slide between each other I could turn up
13:59 - the Glide and I could turn up the slope
14:01 - a little bit just to affect the way it
14:02 - Glides I can maybe hit Legato and now
14:04 - when I have just my one note and I play
14:06 - them uh play another
14:08 - [Music]
14:10 - note I could have a completely different
14:13 - style of sound just because I'm limiting
14:14 - it to one voice so it has to slide
14:16 - between the notes uh like and that's
14:19 - just an interesting thing that you could
14:20 - do and maybe you want to turn this off
14:22 - and then you don't want to Glide and you
14:23 - want to turn up the voices I have
14:25 - chords so just different ways of working
14:27 - so or it depends on what you want
14:29 - um macros uh this is important so a
14:31 - macro you can control a bunch of
14:33 - different things and then have it all
14:34 - one knob controlling all of this so this
14:36 - knob doesn't do anything on its own but
14:38 - it allows you to control many effects at
14:39 - the same time so let's say if I want to
14:41 - change uh a bunch like if I have one
14:44 - type of sound but then if I turn this
14:46 - macro up it affects a bunch of these
14:48 - knobs you could create a second version
14:49 - of that sound just uh based of How High
14:52 - this is up or down um next Advanced
14:55 - thing that you you can know is you any
14:57 - knob that you turn in almost any plugin
14:59 - in FL Studio even third party plugins
15:01 - can be automated so if I turn this macro
15:03 - up and down and then go to this knob up
15:04 - here and click right click you'll see
15:06 - that it says create automation clip if I
15:09 - just click that it'll create an
15:10 - automation clip and then literally if I
15:12 - just drag this up and down and we go
15:14 - back and we play this over and over and
15:16 - then go back to
15:18 - vital you'll see it's it's actually
15:20 - moving the macro in my uh plugin based
15:23 - off of this Automation and I and it
15:24 - works in real time I hold on I need to
15:26 - put this to attached so I can show you
15:28 - guys
15:39 - so that is like just so cool it it works
15:41 - so fast and you like can do things on
15:43 - the fly like as it's happening it's so
15:45 - helpful to do this kind of stuff so uh
15:47 - and automations are huge so you think
15:49 - that um maybe you don't want something
15:51 - to be changed within the plugin itself
15:53 - you can actually change it through
15:54 - automations out here and that could
15:57 - essentially act as
15:59 - yeah like a separate controller for it
16:01 - uh outside of your uh VST and that that
16:03 - could be super helpful so like if you're
16:04 - making a song and I want the volume of
16:06 - the instrument to be low on maybe the
16:08 - sine wave here I have it really low in
16:10 - the beginning of the song but as the
16:11 - song progresses I have this turning up
16:12 - over time just some things to think
16:13 - about just some ideas I can give you um
16:15 - so this is only the first section of the
16:17 - plugin and I didn't even go through all
16:18 - of it I didn't go through lfos lfos are
16:20 - pretty cool I guess I'll show you those
16:21 - really
16:24 - fast so this is affecting the volume but
16:27 - it Loops over and over again so if I
16:28 - turn the frequency
16:32 - up you can see kind of what's happening
16:34 - it's basically going through the playing
16:36 - it's like an envelope right here like
16:37 - the same adsr thing but then imagine
16:39 - that it restarts and plays it again
16:40 - after it gets to the
16:44 - end and then we can change the different
16:47 - uh
16:47 - Mo uh excuse me change the different
16:51 - modes so if I go to like
16:54 - sync oh maybe it's not sink hold
16:57 - on uh oh my bad I'm being silly it's um
17:01 - it would
17:02 - [Music]
17:03 - be
17:05 - [Music]
17:07 - SI you could do some clever things like
17:09 - that where uh it the way that it Loops
17:13 - is differently so sometimes you can Loop
17:14 - it based off of the the grid that you
17:16 - have in FL Studio so it will Loop like
17:19 - uh one beat uh one step like and then
17:21 - like you know just I don't know what the
17:23 - names are for it but then this would go
17:25 - based off a time so it could actually be
17:26 - offbeat with the song so many cool
17:29 - things you could do here um if you ever
17:31 - want to take something off though uh all
17:33 - you have to do is right click and click
17:34 - disconnect from lfl1 or you can go to
17:37 - the lfl that is connected to it and you
17:39 - disconnect from oscillator one and it
17:40 - will give you a list of all things that
17:41 - things are connected to so you can like
17:43 - disconnect things from where they're
17:44 - connected to um and this is also a bunch
17:48 - these are also really cool this has to
17:50 - do with like how you're playing like on
17:51 - your piano uh this will affect like the
17:54 - the the notes and Stu there's so many
17:56 - cool things in this PL I I could spend
17:58 - so time on all this stuff but we're just
18:00 - I want to keep moving too because
18:01 - there's just so much to cover okay uh
18:04 - effects so with effects uh this is
18:07 - basically think of this you have your
18:08 - your wave table uh your oscillator
18:10 - playing a wave table it's uh going
18:11 - through the envelope it might be going
18:13 - through a few filters that signal is
18:15 - going to move on and go to this next
18:17 - section called effects and then whatever
18:19 - you do in here is applied after this
18:21 - section right here so these go like in
18:24 - succession so now you have I can add
18:25 - chorus and it will'll apply to that
18:27 - sound we had from before
18:30 - oh my bad the level's off that's why
18:32 - because we had the LFO and it was
18:33 - controlling the volume so I have to turn
18:34 - this back
18:41 - up um just for sake of uh you guys not
18:44 - listen my piano playing uh let's uh put
18:47 - in a midi a midi from one of my midi
18:49 - packs so just that you guys have
18:51 - something to listen to that's not
18:52 - completely
18:53 - terrible let's play something that's a
18:55 - little bit more drawn
18:57 - out
18:58 - [Music]
19:05 - okay this is cool so we'll play this
19:07 - we'll turn the attack down just slightly
19:09 - and then we'll start uh just you know
19:10 - like making some cool idea so what we'll
19:13 - do is I'll add maybe just a tad bit
19:16 - Distortion just a little bit and this
19:17 - will just add just a little
19:19 - crispiness not that
19:22 - much just ever so slightly I just want
19:24 - it to sound like it's kind of like
19:25 - beaten up a little bit and then we'll
19:27 - add a little post to that Distortion and
19:29 - what that'll do is it'll just cut any
19:31 - [Music]
19:56 - he so got some really like epic synth
19:59 - wave action going on so we have uh let
20:02 - me just go through each one of these so
20:03 - we have filter uh this is just the same
20:04 - thing as what this does but it's just a
20:07 - your a separate thing I guess it's just
20:09 - if you don't want to use the Distortion
20:10 - you can just use this filter um EQ it's
20:13 - exactly what it sounds like it's just
20:14 - your standard EQ that you know just does
20:16 - does the thing um it I feel like okay uh
20:21 - let me just say this right off the bat I
20:22 - might sound like I'm going too fast but
20:23 - if you are a beginner watching this
20:25 - obviously none of this will make any
20:26 - sense but if you're in advanced or if
20:27 - you're looking to become an advanced
20:29 - producer in you're an intermediate stage
20:31 - then you should know what an EQ is by
20:33 - now so I don't I shouldn't have to
20:34 - explain it if you don't know what an EQ
20:35 - is then you probably should spend more
20:36 - time on the beginner tutorial and maybe
20:38 - make a few of your own songs and
20:39 - eventually you figure out what an EQ is
20:41 - and then you come back anyways so I just
20:43 - don't want to be too boring for people
20:45 - who already know what this stuff is
20:46 - because I know that if I explained
20:47 - literally everything like I thought adsr
20:50 - was a little bit too slow for explaining
20:52 - but hopefully that's helpful for
20:53 - somebody you okay flinger uh I can't
20:56 - tell you what this does but it does a
20:57 - thing
20:58 - [Music]
21:04 - [Applause]
21:08 - to me a flinger and a phaser feel like
21:11 - they're doing the same thing with
21:12 - different uh what would it be called
21:14 - like different sound it's different
21:16 - sounds of the same thing that's kind of
21:18 - my take I it even looks like they're
21:19 - doing the same thing I'm not sure what
21:21 - they're doing uh I think it has
21:23 - something to do with the phase uh don't
21:25 - ask it's something pretty complicated
21:27 - but all I know is it can sound cool but
21:28 - sometimes it really messes up your
21:29 - master so lots of produc producers will
21:32 - avoid using a flinger and a phaser
21:34 - because they don't want it to affect
21:35 - their mix too much um Reverb uh very
21:39 - cool the Reverb in this is it's all
21:41 - right it's not
21:46 - [Music]
21:57 - bad
22:02 - I mean the reeverb isn't anything insane
22:04 - like maybe aala super massive or
22:06 - something uh we could add that or
22:09 - convolver or my favorite ROM ROM is the
22:11 - best Reverb uh it was free I don't know
22:14 - if it's free anymore I got it when it
22:16 - was free it was on some promotion uh
22:18 - this is a fantastic Reverb if you were
22:20 - looking for a good Reverb and you're I
22:23 - think I don't know if it's like 40 50
22:24 - bucks this is completely worth it uh and
22:26 - I listen there there some plugins that
22:28 - I'm like okay there are it's hard to
22:30 - come by good reverbs let me just say
22:32 - that like so this is this is a good
22:33 - Reverb like if you're looking for a good
22:35 - Reverb highly recommend this
22:48 - one it just sounds so good oh my
22:51 - goodness okay anyways I'm going to stop
22:52 - ging at uh the ROM uh so different
22:55 - effects what did I miss compressor of
22:56 - course this is a OT t uh is the same
22:59 - thing as this so if you if you guys are
23:01 - familiar I need to turn off the attach
23:02 - this is annoying okay if you guys have
23:04 - used OT uh it's just this plugin right
23:06 - here this is so popular uh OT it's a
23:11 - it's a up and down compressor so
23:12 - downwards
23:13 - compressor um basically imagine you have
23:17 - like a line okay and a compressor as you
23:20 - bring down that line and then whatever
23:22 - the what's it called like the waveform
23:24 - if it went above that line it would just
23:26 - squash it under that line and compress
23:28 - that sound now the what happens with a
23:31 - upwards compressor is it does the exact
23:33 - opposite and I love upwards compressor
23:34 - what it does is I have a line and let's
23:36 - say
23:37 - my uh I have like a waveform whatever
23:40 - doesn't go to that line it's going to
23:43 - get lifted up to that line that's the
23:45 - way I understand it so it lifts up the
23:47 - low points and a compressor uh does the
23:49 - opposite or downwards compressor does
23:50 - the opposite brings the high points down
23:52 - uh so that's the difference I yeah I
23:55 - can't completely tell you if that's
23:56 - correct but I'm like 9% % sure that
23:58 - that's like about what's going on on a
24:00 - very basic
24:03 - level by the way if you're wondering I
24:05 - think OT sounds better than the Ott in
24:06 - vital I'm sorry I don't know why but uh
24:08 - this Ott is it's it's it's all right
24:11 - it's pretty
24:12 - [Music]
24:19 - good it still sounds better with it I
24:26 - think
24:30 - [Music]
24:32 - Okay cool so I pretty much went over the
24:35 - basics of sound design and I would say
24:37 - that this get got a little bit into the
24:38 - advaned ter territory uh not not quite
24:41 - there but the thing is is that I taught
24:43 - you how to become Advanced at sound
24:45 - sound design and that's by looking at
24:47 - different plugins and seeing which
24:49 - things carry over between them and then
24:50 - experimenting the heck out of everything
24:52 - and if you really want a advanced uh tip
24:54 - is to go to your master and then just
24:56 - spend time sound designing and just
24:57 - messing around while you have an Edison
24:59 - on your master and just click the record
25:01 - button right here and then what I'll do
25:03 - is I'll go back into my uh thing and
25:05 - I'll just mess
25:14 - around okay so like let's say you have
25:16 - something like that and you're like I
25:17 - don't know what you just did uh don't
25:18 - worry so I have this right here I go
25:21 - back to my uh playlist I can go to my
25:23 - Edison and as I was recording that I can
25:25 - actually click this button and it's
25:26 - going to put exactly what we just
25:28 - recorded into my
25:37 - track so then maybe I want uh that to be
25:39 - some like weird uh starting thing that I
25:41 - have that's just like the beginning of a
25:44 - track and then I stretch it a little bit
25:46 - and I make it some background element
25:48 - with Reverb and I click control L and I
25:50 - add that and I put some like huge Reverb
25:52 - on it and then
25:53 - I I don't know do something like this
25:56 - this and then I P P that
26:00 - [Music]
26:07 - down and then maybe I add some like
26:09 - crazy grossy thing to it where it like
26:11 - has some
26:13 - [Music]
26:20 - crazy maybe I C it
26:26 - up
26:31 - so as you can see you can do so much
26:32 - from just messing around in your
26:34 - synthesizer recording with Edison on
26:36 - your master and it will record all crazy
26:38 - things that happened in your synthesizer
26:39 - so if you miss something you're like oh
26:40 - that sounded really cool and you still
26:41 - have it recorded in Edison and you can
26:43 - use that later as samples uh for your
26:45 - for your music obviously this was like a
26:47 - really random weird example I probably
26:49 - never use this in a in a song but it's
26:50 - still interesting and you can still mess
26:52 - around like that and I know I went
26:54 - really fast with that I'm going to show
26:55 - you guys more about sampling uh later
26:57 - right right now we're just focused on
26:58 - the south sign aspect so also I don't
27:01 - know why that got applied to my master
27:02 - very interesting okay so uh right here I
27:05 - showed you guys pretty much I think
27:07 - everything I want to do and I the reason
27:09 - I did s design with vital is because I
27:10 - think right now vital is probably one of
27:12 - the best if not the best free
27:13 - synthesizer in my opinion I've been
27:14 - using it a ton is a huge I I love this I
27:18 - love this Bing that's all all I'm going
27:19 - to say uh Matrix okay so the Matrix is a
27:23 - little bit more I don't I would say more
27:26 - complicated to me than it is in serum
27:28 - but uh it's still it's still cool uh I
27:30 - don't really use the Matrix the whole
27:31 - time I used it a ton in in serum I
27:33 - haven't if I'm being completely honest I
27:35 - just haven't found myself needing it yet
27:37 - in vital but I know that is a huge what
27:40 - is it called uh like a huge benefit if
27:42 - you're doing some complex sound design
27:44 - uh The Matrix is going to allow you to
27:46 - more finely tune basically everything in
27:49 - so like let's say you have all the UI
27:51 - and it's kind of all spread out between
27:53 - these knobs and it can be hard to see
27:54 - like what's going on uh a matrix it kind
27:57 - of just simplifies it down to like
28:00 - basically inputs and outputs and very
28:01 - like uh almost like a pro programmer
28:04 - like language of how you use this uh I
28:06 - don't use this too much I used to in
28:07 - serum but with this I haven't spent the
28:09 - time to learn it so I don't want to
28:10 - teach you guys something that I don't
28:11 - feel 100% Comfort Comfort confident in
28:14 - but just know that uh there are good
28:17 - resources for the Matrix and I don't use
28:18 - that much and you don't need it to make
28:20 - it good sounds all right with that said
28:23 - uh the advanced again I have not really
28:25 - uh messed with this at all so Matrix in
28:27 - advance you don't even really need to
28:29 - make really good sounds in vital uh
28:30 - they're just extra things if you want to
28:32 - learn them so there you go and just with
28:34 - these Basics that I've taught you you
28:35 - can pretty much make uh any sound that
28:37 - you can imagine in your head like or any
28:39 - any sound you can imagine in your head
28:40 - any song that you any sound that you've
28:42 - heard in another song unless it's some
28:43 - super complicated dubstep sound like
28:45 - you'll probably be able to re remake
28:47 - that sound really easily just by knowing
28:49 - knowing these few basic things so with
28:53 - that being said I think that uh we're
28:55 - going to go to the next chapter and
28:56 - sound design
28:58 - this is my sound design um part for this
29:01 - chapter and let's go to the next
29:02 - [Music]
29:05 - one from here I also wanted to show you
29:07 - guys uh more in-depth sound design that
29:09 - I've actually used in real songs that I
29:10 - have released on Spotify and I also
29:13 - would like to go over some layering
29:15 - techniques some automation techniques
29:16 - and I just thought okay you going to be
29:17 - way easier uh than just showing you guys
29:20 - each of these things individually it's
29:21 - just to go to a track I've already made
29:23 - and then show you guys how I used it in
29:24 - that particular track so right here I
29:26 - have a track I've made and I actually
29:27 - used um the uh Nitro pack that I added
29:30 - for free to my sample pack uh on my on
29:33 - my website so uh a lot of these uh
29:35 - samples I'm using a lot of these presets
29:37 - uh I used and you can get them too and
29:39 - use the exact same ones that I used uh
29:40 - in my samp pack on my website um also uh
29:44 - i' go over the exactly how I made this
29:46 - track completely in depth on my YouTube
29:47 - channel where I also release uh
29:49 - tutorials as well and that's just under
29:50 - my name trist wox as uh just so you guys
29:53 - can uh follow if you're interested so
29:55 - without further Ado I'm going to play
29:56 - what this sounds like and then we can go
29:58 - over exactly how I sound designed some
30:00 - of the things you can kind of get a
30:01 - snippet of uh some more indepth sound
30:03 - design for actual songs that I've used
30:05 - it for and we can talk about what I
30:07 - [Music]
30:26 - did
30:27 - [Music]
30:38 - so I released this as part of a
30:40 - challenge to make a song in one hour to
30:42 - see what I can make and this is actually
30:44 - what I made so I would like to go over a
30:46 - little bit of this because I think it's
30:47 - really cool how you can see the advanced
30:49 - production just condensed is like
30:51 - quickly as possible so I'm I'm going to
30:53 - be doing one more hour challenges and
30:54 - I'm going to release the full things and
30:55 - I think that this will also be a really
30:56 - helpful way way for you guys to get to
30:58 - see Advanced production action because
31:00 - you'll see what things I think make a
31:03 - song sound really good in the fastest
31:05 - amount of times you kind of see the
31:06 - whole process like compressed and then
31:08 - over a 40 hour period of some like
31:10 - really long Advanced course it would
31:12 - basically be that process but just like
31:14 - lengthened and added more time to it so
31:16 - I could just fill out the song and do a
31:17 - lot more stuff so with that being said
31:19 - uh let's go and see the sound design of
31:21 - the lead I think that that's really
31:24 - leader base first let's
31:26 - do let's do the base okay so I have the
31:29 - Bas
31:30 - [Music]
31:38 - [Music]
31:42 - here so as you can see I actually the
31:45 - pattern here is hugely important to the
31:47 - way the sound sound design of the base
31:48 - is made I have very short notes and then
31:50 - I have uh ones that go up an octave that
31:53 - help the lead or the base feel nice and
31:55 - bouncy so this melody would be
31:57 - completely ruined if I were to change
31:59 - the way my base was and made it like
32:00 - completely sustained for
32:02 - [Music]
32:04 - instance that actually sounds really
32:05 - cool never mind I was wrong uh so
32:08 - regardless uh let's go over uh how this
32:10 - base works so this base basically has a
32:13 - wave table that changes using this
32:14 - envelope um let's see what that sounds
32:18 - [Music]
32:24 - like and that's literally all that's
32:26 - going on with this oscillator uh in the
32:28 - effect section I added a tiny bit of
32:29 - course a lot of distortion I took out
32:32 - the highs and I added a compressor so
32:34 - really not too much going on so you
32:35 - might be thinking how does this sound so
32:37 - much better uh with um with the sound
32:40 - with it being so simple because if you
32:41 - copied exactly what I just did it would
32:42 - not sound anything near what the final
32:44 - sounds like and that's because of two
32:46 - things one being that on my base I have
32:49 - let me drag this so you guys can see it
32:51 - uh I actually let's do this um just make
32:54 - sure it's in view um I have uh different
32:57 - things going on on the base effect rack
32:59 - so I have a overdrive which is just
33:00 - adding a tiny bit of distortion I have
33:02 - an EQ which is affecting the way the
33:04 - balance of the sound is I have a sound
33:06 - cizer which uh yeah you can make fun of
33:09 - me now I love using sound cizer I don't
33:11 - know why it makes it sound good and I
33:13 - know a lot of people say it's terrible
33:14 - for your songs but I digress it sounds
33:16 - good um so that's it that's all I added
33:18 - and it just really beefs up the sound uh
33:21 - so that's really all that's going on
33:22 - with the base um I know it sounds cool
33:25 - but there's not too much going on I just
33:26 - had a little bit Distortion a little bit
33:27 - compression EQ here and there and then
33:30 - just try to keep it simple and I mean
33:32 - the end result I think it sounds pretty
33:34 - good uh I just added a couple other
33:36 - presets here as you can see and one of
33:38 - them was a one octave up just to add a
33:40 - little bit more a mid-base field to the
33:43 - [Music]
33:46 - sound so I have actually three
33:48 - oscillators you can almost think of it
33:49 - as layering three separate bases which
33:51 - is part of sound design is layering so
33:53 - uh this you could think of this uh
33:54 - preset as having three different layers
33:56 - if if you will
34:04 - [Music]
34:09 - and then I just uh changeed the levels
34:10 - of this to get the desired sound I want
34:13 - if I were to change this it could change
34:14 - dramatically
34:15 - [Music]
34:20 - so you can see just just by changing
34:22 - those around it can really affect the
34:23 - the sound uh next I have the lead sound
34:30 - [Music]
34:42 - now the the reason that this one sounds
34:43 - so quiet is because of the different
34:45 - automations when everything's when all
34:46 - the automations are turned on this lead
34:48 - is a lot louder but we can still listen
34:49 - to
34:52 - it so look at how many times I play the
34:55 - same note in a row one two three three
34:57 - I'm going to count that four even though
34:58 - there's slide five six yeah six times so
35:01 - six times in a row I get away with
35:02 - playing the exact same note so your
35:04 - Melodies do not have to go up and down
35:05 - like crazy to create a really uh cool
35:07 - melody in my opinion uh you don't need
35:08 - to make them super complicated just make
35:10 - it easier for the ear to follow and
35:11 - catchy and this works because I have a
35:13 - cool Basse pattern going and then this
35:15 - assist I play the same lead and with the
35:17 - drums it just kind of hits at the same
35:18 - time so it's like oh what's going to
35:20 - happen because you hear like let me just
35:21 - show you so like like three times you
35:23 - hear it hit and you're like waiting for
35:24 - something to happen it's like all right
35:27 - let's let's just turn on everything
35:32 - here it's like almost like you think it
35:35 - might you think the melody might start
35:36 - then the second time but then nothing
35:38 - happens the third time nothing happens
35:40 - and then
35:42 - same I'm like just pushing your
35:45 - expectation just a little bit further
35:46 - and you're like uh and then and then
35:48 - it's cool because I removed all the
35:49 - drums here and then it they came back in
35:51 - so you can see how like my entire
35:53 - production is revolving around like I I
35:55 - just made a heart uh Revol Ving around
35:57 - what I think would be essentially like
35:59 - cool like I'm like okay well if I'm
36:01 - playing the same three notes right here
36:02 - I'll remove all the drums to build up
36:04 - like anticipation for when my melody
36:05 - does start um if I was just a music
36:07 - producer and I wasn't an artist I would
36:09 - just be
36:10 - like like I I would never think uh I
36:13 - would never think of that I I might just
36:15 - put the drums all the way across because
36:16 - that's like a normal thing to do and it
36:18 - might just sound like pretty
36:23 - boring it doesn't have the same feel uh
36:25 - in my opinion so
36:27 - that's that's one thing is that like
36:29 - you're influencing your decisions and
36:31 - your production techniques based off of
36:33 - what idea you have and so that's the key
36:35 - thing to being an artist is that you're
36:37 - actually the process of music production
36:39 - changes based off of what you're trying
36:40 - to accomplish and so if you don't have
36:42 - that uh if you don't have that like okay
36:44 - so when you start off you might not have
36:46 - an exact idea for what you want to make
36:47 - you just start making something but then
36:49 - an idea that you kind of realize that
36:51 - there was a reason behind all the
36:54 - actions that you were doing and all the
36:55 - choices you were making and you can if
36:56 - if you can kind of like hold on to that
36:58 - then you can like make the whole song
37:00 - around that idea it's I know this is
37:02 - sounds so complicated but it's really
37:03 - just like an experience that you have to
37:05 - have making music and I have shared this
37:06 - experience with so many different people
37:08 - who make music they know exactly what
37:09 - I'm talking about there's something that
37:10 - you can kind of like feel and you're
37:12 - like yeah this is the direction I need
37:13 - to go and then once you can kind of hold
37:15 - on to that and like make the whole song
37:16 - around it that's really when you're uh
37:19 - making doing like doing art it's not
37:20 - just like uh the difference is that if
37:23 - you're just kind of making music and
37:24 - doing stuff and you're not feeling
37:25 - anything and there's no idea that's like
37:28 - kind of pulling you to to make certain
37:30 - production decisions then I don't think
37:32 - that you're really making music if that
37:34 - makes sense like there's a there's a a
37:36 - huge difference between those two uh and
37:38 - I know I've already mentioned this like
37:40 - four times but I just really want to
37:41 - drive it home that point because it's so
37:42 - important uh but anyways I digress again
37:46 - so let's listen to some of the cooler
37:48 - things I did with my drums here so I
37:49 - showed you oh wait I didn't show you my
37:50 - lead s design my bad guys okay so uh
37:53 - lead is not too complicated I just have
37:55 - uh it's it's almost the same as my base
37:57 - I think I took my Basse preset and
37:59 - literally just pitched it up I'm not
38:01 - even kidding and then I think I changed
38:02 - the wave table that was it uh so this is
38:04 - actually the same as my base so I
38:06 - literally did the exact same thing I
38:07 - might have just changed the envelope a
38:08 - little bit and that was the only
38:10 - difference I made and then for the
38:13 - second lead I just changed it so the a
38:14 - part of My Melody has has one has one
38:17 - sound as you can hear this is the
38:22 - a so this is like the a part of my
38:24 - melody and this is the B part with a
38:25 - different sound
38:29 - and again we can distinguish the A and
38:31 - the B parts of My Melody based off of
38:33 - the Rhythm that they're playing so
38:34 - technically this is like a b c c okay
38:38 - and the A and the B are kind of using
38:40 - the same the same melody or the same
38:42 - sound okay to introduce the the next
38:45 - part and so I actually I kind of belabor
38:48 - the point of my of My Melody by changing
38:50 - the instrument when it changes the
38:51 - Rhythm and changes uh Melodies is I I
38:54 - want to kind of emphasize that change by
38:56 - changing the sound so if I use the same
38:58 - sound the whole way through I feel like
39:00 - this would be incredibly boring so like
39:01 - I can I can show you what that sound
39:02 - like it would sound like
39:06 - [Music]
39:11 - this so it's sound like
39:14 - [Music]
39:20 - this I mean it's still cool I not even
39:22 - going to lie it is kind of cool but it's
39:24 - just not the
39:25 - same it it sounds cooler when it changes
39:28 - here I I also noticed that it also
39:29 - sounded cooler when I changed it because
39:31 - I forgot that my automations changed and
39:32 - at the end of the automation it actually
39:34 - shifted the sound entirely so this
39:36 - actually would have worked anyways and
39:38 - got the same thing I just did it
39:39 - differently here anyways uh you probably
39:42 - are wondering about this sound right
39:45 - [Music]
39:46 - here and if you were just watching my
39:48 - sound design section you would have saw
39:50 - exactly how I did this technique and if
39:51 - you are really clever you might have
39:53 - actually known how I made this sound so
39:56 - if I go into my piano roll and open up
39:57 - fidal you can see that I actually have
39:59 - this aane all the way up I don't know
40:00 - why it's so short that doesn't really
40:01 - matter though uh and I have an LFO which
40:04 - has my frequency on seconds so it does
40:06 - that exact that that thing I was talking
40:08 - about where it goes like and then it
40:10 - like lengthens out you saw me messing
40:11 - around with
40:13 - that it's doing that with vital so hold
40:16 - on let me go to attached
40:19 - view sorry I know this is like so messy
40:21 - here I'm trying to get it organized so
40:23 - you guys can see what's going on uh
40:25 - let's just close it thing and then
40:27 - reopen it back
40:32 - up okay okay let's
40:35 - go
40:38 - [Music]
40:46 - here so you see you see what's changing
40:48 - down in this LFO that's that's what's
40:50 - going on and I'm automating that uh LFO
40:53 - with a automation here you can see I'm
40:55 - the LFO frequency see going down
41:00 - here so as it goes down it increases in
41:03 - seconds so that is what I'm doing so I
41:05 - just want to show you a real life
41:06 - example of me automating a knob in vital
41:09 - in my song to make an effect that I was
41:11 - trying to get uh anyways okay so I'm
41:14 - going to take this off to attach because
41:15 - I can't say uh let's go to my drums and
41:17 - now I I showed you guys the lead and the
41:19 - bases it's so simple I literally just
41:20 - had one uh synth for each and then I
41:23 - just processed the the lead and the lead
41:25 - processing was so so simple what I did
41:27 - was I basically actually used my my base
41:30 - what's it called my base
41:32 - uh uh insert as a bus for my lead in my
41:36 - base and you might be going like what in
41:38 - the world you put your lead into your
41:40 - base I did and it and it kind of works
41:43 - so I'm not even going to lie I think the
41:44 - reason it works is because the
41:45 - compression of the lead and the base go
41:46 - together before it gets recompressed on
41:48 - the master and that's why it's so like
41:49 - uh kind of loud and it just works so for
41:52 - my lead preset I literally just have
41:54 - fresh air which uh kind of increases the
41:55 - highing gives it a little bit more
41:57 - crispiness um I have Crush automations
41:59 - which are just bit crush and those turn
42:01 - on and off throughout the song and kind
42:02 - of highlight different parts of the
42:03 - melody with bit crush and I have another
42:05 - KZ bit Crush all these are free plugins
42:07 - by the way delay very cool I don't think
42:09 - I ended up using this but it is a very
42:11 - cool plugin and then I just cut out some
42:13 - of the lows so it left some room for the
42:14 - base and then I boost to the highs again
42:16 - so that's what I did and then on my lead
42:18 - I also always make sure to add white
42:20 - noise so the reason I do this is because
42:22 - it fills up all that highend so I pitch
42:23 - the White Noise up to 48 uh and then I
42:26 - just
42:26 - have it hit on it depends on how you
42:29 - want it but I kind of automate it so
42:30 - that the white noise gives it more
42:33 - crispy like Snap because if I take this
42:34 - out and play
42:37 - it see how lame that sounds but then
42:39 - when I add White
42:44 - Noise has so much more energy it's like
42:46 - it's like not even comparable so if
42:47 - you're not using white noise you're
42:49 - really shooting yourself in the foot is
42:50 - terms of like energy for these type of
42:52 - music uh and obviously you may not be
42:54 - making this type of music but still
42:55 - white noise is is huge so let's play the
42:57 - drums and just listen what the
42:58 - [Music]
43:03 - sound first of all I am complimenting my
43:05 - kick drum by having uh these claps and
43:08 - ride
43:16 - so and then this is an example of just
43:18 - percussion uh that I added in I'm like
43:20 - oh it sound cool and this is literally
43:22 - me this is the process of advanced
43:23 - production I'm going here and going oh
43:25 - but happened if I took this this symbol
43:27 - and like Shunk it down like to a fourth
43:29 - of its side just played it over and over
43:31 - and over again right here it's
43:32 - like and then I increase the volume of
43:35 - these very slowly so it's was like and
43:37 - then that's literally what I'm doing I'm
43:39 - just like sitting here like minutely
43:40 - changing these things to make something
43:41 - that sounds cool that's like that's
43:43 - Advanced production a beginner they just
43:45 - would like pull a sample and this is
43:47 - nothing wrong with this I do this all
43:48 - the time sometimes it's actually better
43:50 - like you'll see over in the beginning of
43:51 - my song I did I just literally pulled
43:53 - the seatics hip-hop drum Loop because I
43:54 - was like oh this sounds good and and
43:56 - that's fine but I also know how to make
43:58 - drum Loops too it's not like I don't
43:59 - know what I'm doing like I just did it
44:01 - because it sounded good and that's the
44:02 - end quality that I wanted but I I'm also
44:04 - capable and this is I think the thing
44:06 - you don't want to be using tools that
44:08 - take away from the skill that you don't
44:09 - have so you should be able to do pretty
44:11 - much everything but on your own and then
44:12 - just use the tools as complimentary
44:15 - things that aren't holding up your
44:16 - production but are like helping you do
44:20 - things that you already know how to do
44:21 - but just uh saving you time or uh
44:23 - improving your creative work so yeah
44:27 - whoops uh so I also took the kick and
44:30 - reversed it so it kind of like sucks it
44:31 - back in the kick right here you hear
44:34 - that going
44:36 - if so that just keeps it interesting
44:38 - just like little tidbits here and there
44:40 - and these this is just the type type of
44:41 - stuff that happens when you're like
44:42 - working for long times on tracks I mean
44:44 - this one obviously was an hour so I
44:45 - didn't have a ton of time but uh it was
44:48 - uh quite fun to add a all of stuff in so
44:50 - I'm trying to think what else I can show
44:51 - you guys so I uh added a obviously
44:54 - automations here and there to exemplify
44:55 - different parts of the melody the A and
44:57 - B Parts uh by automating different
44:59 - aspects of the of the sound and I also
45:02 - have reeverb automations that go in
45:03 - between the notes so that uh the Reverb
45:05 - plays when there's no note playing so it
45:07 - kind of fills that space a little bit
45:09 - and then I always make sure that I have
45:10 - a little bit of a background noise going
45:11 - in the background so that you can uh it
45:13 - fills up those empty gaps and doesn't
45:15 - make the song sound so dry so like if I
45:16 - take this
45:17 - [Music]
45:23 - out you can see the difference is
45:25 - absolutely massive so
45:26 - and there was other parts I took out so
45:27 - some things I mute because I'm like I I
45:29 - didn't like the way that turned out so
45:30 - like I I guess I had this I don't know
45:31 - what this
45:33 - [Music]
45:37 - was so I said okay I don't like that so
45:39 - I took it out so you can mute ideas
45:41 - overtime too and some things that don't
45:43 - fit and that's perfectly fine so that's
45:44 - just part of the process um I don't know
45:47 - how much more I have to show you guys I
45:49 - guess other than maybe this 808 was like
45:50 - really cool uh it sounded pretty
45:52 - interesting so like if I go to the
45:53 - beginning of the track
45:54 - here
45:56 - [Music]
46:03 - [Music]
46:15 - [Music]
46:20 - so I literally just took the same base
46:24 - and
46:27 - it's just automated different things to
46:28 - make it fit uh it's just like your
46:31 - standard 808 sound I thought it I
46:32 - thought it was really cool and I kind of
46:34 - reuse things to make uh make it go
46:36 - faster so I reuse this base uh from the
46:38 - drop as my 808 in this part of the
46:40 - hip-hop song uh so that's kind of what I
46:43 - did um I'm trying to think what else to
46:46 - show you guys I use delay to have a cool
46:48 - intro effect here so that's why it
46:49 - sounds like it's repeating itself over
46:51 - and
46:54 - over
46:57 - you hear that like let me turn it off
46:58 - and you'll you'll hear the difference in
47:00 - like what goes on when I turn that
47:04 - off okay let's play
47:09 - [Music]
47:12 - now here there's like no repeating and
47:15 - then like let me turn the this delay
47:16 - back on you'll see the the effect I had
47:18 - I think it was huge I think that this
47:20 - really
47:21 - [Music]
47:24 - made
47:29 - see how cool that is I I love that delay
47:31 - effect I a friend show it to me and I've
47:32 - been using it like ever since um I have
47:35 - this really cool thing I do in the in
47:36 - the beginning of all my songs with
47:37 - convolver so if you want to steal my
47:39 - signature artist thing that I do go for
47:41 - it uh so basically this is what it
47:42 - sounds
47:43 - like I have a convolver on the
47:46 - master and right here what this does is
47:48 - it basically I put the preset on
47:49 - [Music]
47:51 - B and then I automated it from 100% to
47:54 - zero and
47:56 - and if I turn like the pink noise all
47:59 - the way up in any part of the song
48:00 - you'll hear what it
48:08 - does it like just washes everything out
48:11 - it sounds so cool and so epic I love
48:13 - like doing that to like kind of
48:14 - introduce a new part of the song so uh I
48:17 - showed you guys about layering I showed
48:18 - you guys about layering different sounds
48:20 - uh the one thing I didn't describe to
48:21 - you guys is that uh each sound that I
48:23 - picked in this particular track I had a
48:24 - specific Place board so I picked the
48:26 - three different um oscillators in my
48:28 - base because I wanted a mid base I
48:29 - wanted a sign subbase and I wanted a
48:32 - another low base so that's why I picked
48:33 - three different sways and they're all
48:34 - serving a different purpose then I
48:36 - picked my lead and I picked it and I'm
48:38 - like okay the lead will go in the higher
48:40 - uh range so that's why I cut the low or
48:41 - the highs out of the base so that the
48:43 - highs for my lead would fit there and
48:45 - you can kind of see my my head working
48:47 - like I'm like okay I don't want the base
48:48 - to have a ton of highs because I know
48:49 - the lead is going to have a lot of highs
48:51 - and so I'm sound designing and doing my
48:53 - sound selection based off of the needs
48:54 - of my track so I'm not just adding a ton
48:56 - of sounds throwing sounds at the wall
48:58 - until something sticks what I'm doing is
48:59 - I'm selectively and subconsciously
49:01 - picking sounds that fit the the ENT the
49:04 - entire hole I did the hard thing again
49:06 - uh to fit the entire hole the way that
49:09 - I'm looking to do so that's how you
49:10 - should be picking out sounds it's uh
49:12 - pick out sounds like you're putting
49:13 - stuff in your fridge from the grocery
49:14 - store you have like you wouldn't just
49:16 - Chuck everything in the in the fridge
49:18 - you have to like methodically go okay I
49:20 - have room for this here this here I need
49:22 - something that's going to fit here so
49:23 - I'll put something here and you're like
49:25 - methodically packing everything packing
49:27 - is also a great example there's so many
49:29 - different examples I can use for mixing
49:30 - it's like packing it's like you have a
49:31 - ton of clothes that you need to fit for
49:32 - your trip and you're packing them in
49:34 - certain spots and if you just chuck all
49:35 - your clothes in there there's a very low
49:36 - likelihood that it's going to fit
49:37 - together so if your mix sucks it's
49:39 - probably because you're throwing a bunch
49:39 - of random stuff in your suitcase and
49:41 - you're not actually deciding okay do I
49:42 - actually need to bring this is this
49:43 - useful nope going to check that out
49:45 - because that's just a random Pizza
49:46 - t-shirt that I don't need so there's
49:48 - just like random things that you put in
49:49 - there it's probably not going to sound
49:50 - very good so just be very what is the
49:53 - word like intentional um and and uh
49:56 - it'll become subconscious over time of
49:59 - what sounds you're putting in there but
50:00 - basically try to fill everything up so
50:02 - everything has its particular spot and
50:03 - nothing's fighting for space amongst
50:04 - each other and you won't need to have a
50:06 - million eqs eqing everything because the
50:09 - sounds that you pick will just fit so
50:11 - well together that they don't need
50:12 - anything else um last thing I guess I
50:14 - could go over uh within this track uh
50:17 - that will show some more advanced
50:18 - production techniques is the fact that I
50:19 - used um my master I literally I showed
50:22 - you the convolution thing I added an OT
50:24 - this is hilarious I have no idea why
50:26 - this OT is on my master but it sounded
50:28 - really good for this song I don't
50:29 - normally endorse this I think that
50:31 - putting this OT on your master it
50:33 - probably is going to make mess up a lot
50:34 - of stuff for some reason it just sounds
50:36 - good and I listen to my mix and mono too
50:39 - and I think it's okay so uh sometimes
50:40 - the sck stuff works but I wouldn't
50:42 - recommend it and sometimes it can get
50:43 - you in hot water so I think I
50:44 - accidentally added this and I just kept
50:46 - it so sometimes that happens um happy
50:48 - accidents Bob R Us uh so with my fruity
50:51 - balance I usually have a fruity balance
50:53 - to just turn down everything and then I
50:55 - Master it uh this for some reason I
50:56 - didn't uh I'll show you a different
50:58 - example that this EQ barely boosting
51:01 - barely uh cutting just very basic stuff
51:03 - here um if you guys can't see my master
51:05 - chain I'm sorry I realized that is
51:07 - probably out of key okay there we go now
51:09 - it's now it's better um so I have my uh
51:12 - parametric EQ just barely cutting barely
51:14 - doing anything make sure to turn the
51:16 - linear button on if this is your master
51:17 - EQ because you uh don't want to create
51:19 - phasing issues or any different issues
51:21 - like that um fresh air I do this just to
51:23 - boost the highs of the entire track it
51:26 - fantastic uh this is a Frank pull free
51:28 - plugin it's called inflator it's based
51:30 - off of the Oxford inflator uh again it's
51:32 - an upwards compressor and I use this on
51:34 - my track to kind of bring up the low
51:35 - points and just make it sound more full
51:37 - um then I added a midside EQ so I could
51:40 - dynamically boost the mono subbase and I
51:43 - could cut the wide base on my track and
51:46 - boost the the side highs so the width of
51:49 - a track in the mono of a track I have
51:51 - separated in two different eqs that are
51:53 - both on linear mode and then I boost uh
51:56 - the EQ on the side in the side of my
51:57 - headphones I boost the highs in the
51:59 - sides and I cut the the base in the
52:01 - sides the low subbase and then in the
52:04 - mono frequencies I boost this sub and I
52:06 - don't really do anything with the with
52:07 - the rest of the mix and if you want this
52:10 - uh I have it also in my sample pack but
52:12 - it's so easy to make and I would feel
52:13 -  if I didn't just show you uh
52:16 - just how to make it yourself so this is
52:18 - what it is it's just this this is what
52:19 - the midside splitter looks like you just
52:21 - open up Patcher put this here and then
52:23 - you just uh take one of the outputs put
52:24 - it to an and the other output to another
52:26 - EQ and then you drag it back to FL
52:28 - Studio like so and then that will give
52:30 - you a midside EQ which is probably one
52:32 - of the
52:33 - most nerdy but like cool things to do is
52:35 - to midside EQ everything and uh
52:38 - dynamically control the way your sound
52:39 - sounds with different uh and your mono
52:42 - and wide I I do I love doing that it's
52:44 - one of my favorite mixing techniques and
52:46 - it honestly will level up your
52:47 - Productions like from here to here if
52:49 - you just start using midside EQ uh in my
52:51 - opinion uh soft Clipper this is just my
52:54 - limiter cuz I didn't pay for anything so
52:56 - this is my free limiter is it just a
52:57 - soft Clipper so just goes to show I used
52:59 - to use pro2 I loved it and then I'm my
53:02 - computer crossed I lost everything and
53:03 - now I'm back to soft Clipper so there
53:05 - there you have it uh two last things I
53:08 - can show you is on my the C the for
53:10 - stands for I don't know what it stands
53:11 - for so I'm not going to make it up uh
53:13 - you click that it's not your master and
53:15 - I put a span on here and this just helps
53:17 - me see what's going on in my track
53:18 - dynamically with my
53:24 - EQ and this is pretty much the best like
53:29 - like as terms of a mix like if you're
53:30 - just like looking at that
53:39 - like look at this it's like it's
53:42 - beautiful like this is the what you are
53:44 - aiming for you like you have the the
53:46 - base and then it lowers off in the muddy
53:47 - region and then the mids aren't
53:49 - overtaking the entire track but then the
53:50 - highs are boosted up again to the human
53:52 - ear this sounds really good this sounds
53:55 - really good uh this is kind of what
53:56 - you're looking for if you have too much
53:57 - going on in here gets out a little bit
53:59 - muddy if you have too much going in here
54:01 - it might take away uh the balance of the
54:03 - track it might take away from the
54:05 - dynamic of it if you have a lot going on
54:07 - in here you're going to have a lot of
54:07 - energy in your track if you have a lot
54:09 - going in here it's going to it's going
54:10 - to it's going to hit it's going to hit
54:12 - hard okay in the in the cars so if you
54:14 - want to hear what it sounds like in your
54:15 - car without going to your car uh Frank
54:17 - pole has another amazing plugin called
54:19 - uh Inspector Gadget uh no it's not
54:21 - called Inspector Gadget it's called
54:22 - inspector 2 and you can click this on
54:24 - and it'll simulate different
54:28 - [Music]
54:31 - environments so I gu simulates like a
54:34 - really bad speaker I don't know what
54:35 - that
54:37 - [Music]
54:50 - is outside the club is just this is all
54:54 - you hear is just low
55:02 - it's your side
55:06 - mix invert the polarity swap the sides
55:09 - and just hear the offset left and right
55:10 - solo super great I love this and then I
55:12 - just turned it off uh and then yeah so
55:15 - that's my master chain I showed you my
55:16 - mix chains I showed you how I layer I
55:18 - showed you how I do my effects I showed
55:19 - you how how to do my automations I show
55:21 - you how to do rhythms with drums sorry
55:23 - for talking so much um and I showed you
55:25 - how it's okay to use samples and Loops
55:27 - but it's also good to make your own and
55:29 - that you shouldn't use it as crutches
55:30 - but it's using samples a completely
55:32 - legitimate way of producing um what else
55:35 - to talk about I guess Arrangement uh so
55:37 - arrangement I have I try to have some
55:40 - rhythmic element in every part of my
55:41 - track except for the the com the first
55:43 - like eight bars sometimes I'll have it
55:45 - very washed out and you're like oh
55:46 - what's going on it sounds cool and then
55:47 - it like goes straight into like the the
55:49 - Bas
55:50 - in go straight into this
55:52 - [Music]
55:54 - part
55:55 - so that's something I'll do um what else
55:58 - I have the buildup here obviously this
55:59 - is a certain style of music so you're
56:00 - thinking like okay this is EDM uh so or
56:03 - electronic dance music particular this
56:05 - would be Basse house maybe future house
56:08 - uh is um that's kind of the what your
56:11 - what genre it would fit in um if you
56:14 - don't make this type of music that's
56:15 - fine your Arrangements is going to just
56:16 - look different uh but these producing
56:18 - techniques are Universal and where you
56:20 - can take these techniques I've taught
56:21 - you to any genre I've made hip-hop
56:23 - before I've made pop rock all kinds of
56:24 - different
56:25 - in learning EDM is I think the single
56:28 - greatest asset you can do to improve
56:30 - your production in all areas because
56:32 - electronic music production teaches you
56:34 - every area of music production whereas
56:36 - if I just do instrumentals I'm not going
56:38 - to learn a lot of flu because I don't
56:40 - need to with electronic music production
56:41 - there's so many different techniques
56:42 - that so many people use that it just you
56:45 - can learn so much and then and then
56:46 - reapply it to certain specific genres so
56:49 - if you make hip-hop and you just
56:51 - practice your electronic music
56:52 - production I think that it will really
56:53 - help you with hip-hop uh this is
56:55 - something that I learned is that I
56:56 - people who I make hip-hop for they're
56:58 - like wow these songs are like really
56:59 - interesting I haven't heard something
57:00 - like this it's because I'm not a hip-hop
57:01 - producer I'm a EDM producer who tried to
57:04 - make hip-hop by listening to some things
57:05 - and so my takes on things and my Beats
57:08 - and stuff that I make gets out a lot
57:10 - more interesting and not like copy paste
57:12 - what other hip-hop producers do because
57:13 - of just you come from a different place
57:15 - so experiment by making lots of
57:17 - different genres and will actually
57:18 - improve the overall quality of all your
57:20 - music across the board uh that's one
57:22 - thing that you can take from this so uh
57:24 - I hope this was help I just went through
57:25 - this part uh now we're going to go to
57:27 - the next part of the tutorial and I'll
57:29 - see you
57:32 - there in this chapter I'm going to show
57:34 - you uh some other tips that have to do
57:36 - with Melodies harmonies and just overall
57:39 - uh instrumentation and layering so right
57:41 - here I have what's called a layer if you
57:42 - go to plus uh you can add in a layer I
57:44 - forgot I already forgot where it was uh
57:47 - there it is right there so you can add
57:48 - in a layer and what that will do is it
57:49 - allow you to play two instruments at the
57:51 - same time on your keyboard so I added
57:52 - one Labs piano
57:55 - fre sampler by the way lives are
57:57 - fantastic and then I added another
57:58 - preset
57:59 - here but when I click my layer it plays
58:02 - both at the same
58:03 - time which is really cool so the way I
58:06 - did this is that I selected all of these
58:07 - at the same time with my layer open and
58:09 - you click set children and then this uh
58:12 - becomes a parent uh congratulations he's
58:13 - the father so uh we're going to go to
58:15 - the piano roll and we have this layer
58:17 - right here and when I whenever I place a
58:18 - note it's going to play both of these
58:19 - instruments at the same
58:22 - time so you can hear the piano at the
58:24 - same time so now I'm going to go through
58:26 - some of the uh some of the midi that I
58:28 - have from my sample pack uh again my
58:30 - sample Pack's on my website if you're
58:31 - interested and uh and right here I'm
58:34 - just going to use some of the mini as an
58:35 - example of different ways you can make
58:37 - Melodies and uh just understand uh
58:39 - Melody and Harmony making so let's just
58:41 - start with the first one I have no idea
58:42 - what this sounds
58:43 - like whoa so fast all right let's slow
58:46 - this down to like 110
58:47 - [Music]
58:53 - Maybe
58:56 - [Music]
59:01 - so as you can see uh let's just uh
59:03 - simplify this down so uh I have this one
59:06 - Baseline
59:14 - going and this is just a normal Baseline
59:16 - like this is pretty much as simple as it
59:18 - gets and then on top of this I just
59:20 - added uh another uh note the compliment
59:22 - it another Harmony
59:26 - there two different
59:26 - [Music]
59:33 - notes and you see right here that I have
59:35 - an a b a b Melody why is that because
59:39 - this a parts match together and then the
59:41 - rhythm of these B Parts match together
59:42 - because these two notes at the end are
59:43 - matching so I have a b a b okay and then
59:50 - with that Melody I added another on top
59:52 - of
59:53 - there
59:55 - and then this uh has its own pattern to
59:57 - it um which somehow works in the in the
60:00 - process of the whole even though that
60:01 - they're actually kind of all different
60:03 - but I still say it's a a b anyways um
60:06 - but it's a little bit more complex uh
60:08 - basically I just kind of this is just
60:10 - trial and eror just like placing okay I
60:12 - have this pattern or idea or Motion in
60:14 - my head what am I trying to get out on
60:16 - [Music]
60:21 - here like I just kind of had this idea
60:23 - I'm like okay uh let's uh like here's a
60:25 - better example I want to start from
60:26 - scratch I'll just make ail you guys can
60:28 - kind of see what I'm
60:32 - doing so it's
60:35 - like I I can't sing but you get the
60:38 - [Music]
60:53 - idea
60:58 - [Music]
61:20 - [Music]
61:23 - this something like you know you can
61:25 - make all kinds of different Melodies and
61:26 - I just there's like pretty much like an
61:28 - infinite array of different Melodies
61:29 - that could be played on top of this but
61:31 - a lot of it comes from uh just kind of
61:35 - experience I guess is the best way to
61:36 - put it uh I made lots of bad Melodies
61:38 - and so by making lots of bad Melodies
61:39 - over and over again you can kind of see
61:41 - um I just want to show you a lot of
61:42 - Melody so you can kind of see the
61:44 - patterns between them and hopefully get
61:45 - a better sense of like what uh you can
61:47 - be looking at when you're trying to make
61:48 - good Mel so let's skip this one I want
61:49 - to make okay let's see what this
61:53 - is
62:00 - so again I have this uh interesting
62:01 - thing so these are basically just chords
62:02 - and then I have it playing almost like
62:04 - an art Melody so I can have I could have
62:05 - had this like
62:06 - [Music]
62:10 - this like
62:12 - this this was a completely valid and
62:15 - thing I could have
62:18 - [Music]
62:23 - done
62:25 - but it sounds interesting when I have it
62:26 - playing like an
62:32 - art so just experiment with maybe it
62:35 - sounds better if your chords are playing
62:36 - more of an art Melody uh maybe that
62:38 - leads into the melody overall as a whole
62:41 - um so that's another thing that you
62:42 - could uh try to experiment with um let's
62:44 - keep going and see what other Melodies I
62:45 - have here that's a little complicated to
62:47 - skip
62:48 - [Music]
62:53 - that
62:58 - [Music]
63:08 - so as you can see here I have a very
63:10 - simple uh like cor progression because
63:12 - it just it does it's not like a
63:14 - complicated Rhythm you know it's just
63:15 - playing like these four bars and it's
63:18 - just if I delete everything else but
63:19 - selected you can hear how simple this is
63:21 - so if I
63:22 - select um int selection and then just
63:25 - [Music]
63:32 - delete this a very simple core
63:34 - progression and then this melody on top
63:36 - of it is what gives it all the depth
63:38 - that it has and um I think that doing
63:40 - that is by having a solid if you build a
63:42 - solid Baseline you can build a solid
63:44 - core progression on top of that and you
63:45 - can make a solid Melody on top of that
63:47 - or you can go the reverse Direction I
63:48 - tend to find that either by building a
63:51 - strong base you can it can inspire a
63:52 - melody or if you have a strong Melody it
63:54 - can Inspire everything below it so you
63:56 - know what why don't we just try making a
63:57 - corporation maybe that that'll help you
63:59 - guys so uh something that you could do
64:01 - is just start with a Basse so I'll do it
64:02 - both ways I'll start with the melody one
64:04 - time and I'll start with a base another
64:06 - so let's just copy
64:09 - [Music]
64:21 - this this is very mysterious very
64:23 - interesting so so what if I do something
64:25 - [Music]
64:42 - like so I'm going to add a middle notes
64:44 - to
64:50 - [Music]
64:53 - these
64:55 - [Music]
65:09 - this is kind of interesting I'm trying
65:10 - to figure out exactly how to how to pars
65:13 - it here then you can take these middle
65:15 - notes and you can go up and active I'm
65:16 - not sure how I'm feeling about this
65:17 - Corporation so
65:17 - [Music]
65:23 - far
65:24 - [Music]
65:27 - I wonder what this sounds
65:29 - [Music]
65:31 - like it's interesting um it's definitely
65:35 - I guess I don't know what the word is
65:36 - I'm not 100% feeling it yet so what I
65:38 - might do is I might take uh these notes
65:40 - and just uh put them up an
65:45 - [Music]
65:53 - octave
66:03 - as as you can see for me it's a lot of
66:04 - trial on there seeing what sounds good
66:07 - not like good right off the
66:11 - bat that doesn't sound very good
66:16 - [Music]
66:23 - either
66:27 - somehow every single one of these notes
66:28 - sounds bad I like that I don't like that
66:31 - chord so you can see like sometimes like
66:34 - Melodies they they don't come too easily
66:35 - so sometimes like starting the Baseline
66:36 - didn't really work that time so like I'm
66:38 - going to try a
66:53 - melody
66:54 - [Music]
67:16 - [Music]
67:31 - [Music]
67:45 - it's also difficult and I notic this uh
67:47 - from recording other times as well is
67:49 - that uh long periods of silence for me
67:51 - uh happen because I'm thinking and I'm
67:53 - also trying to produce and teaching and
67:56 - producing are like two different sides
67:57 - of my brain so like I almost cannot do
67:59 - it at the same time and switching
68:00 - between them as you can see is a very
68:02 - difficult for me and also makes it
68:03 - really hard to make Melodies and a lot
68:05 - of times I'll spend even longer making
68:07 - really bad Melodies until something good
68:08 - comes up uh so it just goes to show that
68:11 - not every time you open up the pan roll
68:12 - you're going to make something awesome
68:13 - and sometimes you could use a different
68:15 - source of inspiration so for that reason
68:17 - why don't I try finding a sample and
68:19 - maybe that can uh help me come up with a
68:21 - cool melody or something that could help
68:23 - ins Spark some inspiration so what I'm
68:25 - going to do is I'm going to open up adsr
68:26 - sample manager and this is so awesome
68:28 - because if you download free sample
68:29 - packs or buy sample packs what happens
68:31 - is is that they can all be stored in
68:33 - adsr Sample manager and then I can
68:35 - search up different types of samples and
68:37 - it will sort them for me automatically
68:38 - and I can cool very quickly find
68:40 - something I'm looking for so I'm going
68:42 - to look up for a cool drum sample uh
68:45 - sample and then just scroll and then I
68:48 - only want Loops so I'm going to click
68:50 - off of that
68:52 - Arrow
69:02 - okay so 110 that sounded really cool I'm
69:04 - going to use this metal Rhythm and I'm
69:06 - going to turn it down in octave just to
69:07 - see what it sounds
69:12 - like that's really cool okay so I'm
69:14 - going to go back here and I'm going to
69:16 - search up instead of drums I'm going to
69:17 - find some type of weird guitar Loop
69:20 - Maybe and Just scroll down
69:31 - that's really
69:34 - interesting okay so now we have
69:48 - this okay this is really cool so now
69:50 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
69:51 - take this sample and I'm actually going
69:52 - to put it uh why so what uh I'm going to
69:55 - teach you guys how to use the sampler
69:57 - and I'm going to teach you guys how to
69:58 - make Melodies so I'll just do both at
69:59 - the same time kill two BRS with one
70:01 - stone uh so except there will be no
70:03 - death in making this video okay so uh
70:06 - when I open up the sample here is I just
70:08 - double click on any sample and I can
70:09 - change different uh thing things and
70:11 - qualities about it so right there I
70:12 - turned down the pitch of the sample down
70:13 - an octave uh there's also reverse I
70:16 - could reverse the
70:17 - [Music]
70:22 - sample
70:25 - that's also kind of cool uh you can do
70:27 - all sorts of things I can change how how
70:29 - long it takes before the sample goes in
70:30 - I can change how long it takes till the
70:32 - sample goes out I can cross fade it uh
70:34 - which is really complicated but really
70:36 - cool um if I click not this wrench tool
70:39 - but if I click the other tool it lets me
70:41 - boost the volume of that I can clip I
70:43 - can clip it I do that a lot for drums
70:44 - and make it sound really cool um you can
70:46 - also add stereo delay which is going to
70:48 - make it sound really wide but it is
70:49 - going to mess up the stereo image
70:52 - slightly
70:54 - [Music]
70:59 - all the St image is fine right now so
71:01 - I'll leave you that with the stereo
71:03 - widened and then I'll control L with
71:05 - this guitar as well I'm going to add a
71:06 - CH to this guitar because I feel like
71:08 - that would sound really cool so I'm just
71:09 - add a vintage chorus turn that
71:11 - [Music]
71:21 - down I'm going to cut out the lows out
71:23 - of
71:24 - [Music]
71:29 - the and then this is just a a loop so I
71:32 - still need to add like drums so what I'm
71:33 - going to do is I'm going to go to uh my
71:36 - own sample pack this is not the one I'm
71:37 - selling but this is just the one I've
71:38 - built over time so I'm going to just
71:40 - find some kind of cool clap here it's
71:42 - like a hip-hop
71:52 - clap
72:09 - that's fine we'll just use this one so
72:10 - we
72:11 - have oh I want it I want it fast just
72:13 - like
72:13 - [Music]
72:22 - this
72:26 - and then I need a high hat so I need the
72:28 - high hat to kind of just play over and
72:29 - over
72:33 - again a very fast I had like yeah
72:36 - perfect just something like this and
72:38 - then I'm going to go to my pain tool and
72:39 - just paint
72:48 - across I'm going to put contr l and then
72:51 - I'm going to add pancake onto it and
72:52 - what pancake does is it's funny because
72:54 - I had pancakes R this morning uh
72:55 - pancakes is pancakes pancake 2 is going
72:59 - to change the St image to go left and
73:00 - right so it'll make it more interesting
73:02 - for our high house you hear going back
73:05 - and
73:05 - [Music]
73:11 - forth and then you know why don't we add
73:13 - a crazy Reverb on this and then have it
73:16 - uh just Decay over time it just gets uh
73:18 - turned down over time so we we'll just
73:20 - turn that uh Decay or turn the Reverb
73:22 - off then create an automation like this
73:24 - and then have it start all the way at
73:26 - the top and then lower over
73:27 - [Music]
73:45 - time and then we could have it go like a
73:48 - crazy 808 just hit really hard and then
73:50 - we could have a kick uh let's make a
73:52 - kick and clap a combo here that's
73:55 - perfect just use that kick so have it
73:57 - kind of go
74:00 - [Music]
74:04 - late just the easiest drum Loop of all
74:06 - time and then just copy and paste that
74:08 - over and over again so we'll just select
74:10 - uh the drums that we have here highlight
74:11 - them uh select that part of the song and
74:13 - only the drums and control bbbbb and
74:16 - then it's going to put that exactly over
74:17 - and over again for us and then to make
74:20 - it really interesting let's zoom in here
74:22 - copy this drum again paste it click make
74:24 - unique as sample and then go here and
74:26 - then reverse it and then we can just uh
74:29 - not stretch it but we can click off a
74:31 - stretch then we can turn this down oh my
74:34 - goodness I can't click turn this down
74:35 - like that like so and then that will
74:37 - make it so that it kind of
74:41 - slides uh and then we'll just take that
74:43 - out and then make it a little bit
74:46 - [Music]
74:52 - longer
74:56 - [Music]
74:57 - and then we'll add a base here so now we
74:59 - need to add an 808 so this 808 uh we
75:01 - want it to H hard so we are going to put
75:04 - an 808 Loop here uh and I'm going to go
75:07 - to vital and I'm going to go to whatever
75:10 - 808 sample I
75:12 - have and I'm just going to put contr l
75:14 - and then I'm going to go and find the
75:16 - exact so I save all my presets and I
75:19 - save all of my effects for those presets
75:21 - so I have file save mixer track state as
75:24 - so if I make any changes to this mixer I
75:27 - add things I like at the end of it I can
75:28 - go on this mixer right click go to file
75:31 - save as and I can save and type in the
75:32 - name that I want that mixer preset to be
75:35 - and I can go to my um the the sound
75:38 - that's going to that mixer and then go
75:39 - up here to the file go save preset as
75:42 - and then I click that and I name it the
75:43 - exact same thing so that I can open up
75:44 - my sound and I can open up my mixture
75:46 - preset for that sound every time I want
75:48 - it so then I have uh I can save my work
75:50 - from other songs and put them in in over
75:52 - time so so I'm never like losing my work
75:55 - uh and it helps you be a better producer
75:57 - over time because then you can have your
75:59 - work carry over you know so that's
76:00 - pretty cool uh let's make an 88
76:04 - [Music]
76:17 - preset I don't really like the state
76:19 - away so we're going to change
76:20 - it it's just too I don't know it's not
76:22 - really working for me so let's find
76:24 - something
76:25 - else let's see did I make another
76:28 - one maybe I don't have
76:37 - [Music]
76:52 - one see if I can make something quick
76:59 - [Music]
77:13 - [Music]
77:22 - here
77:28 - [Music]
77:44 - we'll just copy paste this and then
77:45 - change the thing it
77:49 - [Music]
77:52 - hits
77:53 - [Music]
78:09 - [Music]
78:20 - it's not really fitting for me
78:24 - [Music]
78:38 - I'm not really deing the 808 pattern
78:39 - right here at all I think it's not it's
78:40 - because I don't like uh the patch either
78:43 - so I'm going to change the flex I'm just
78:44 - going to go to premade 808 so I don't
78:45 - take forever on making something but as
78:48 - you can see lots of ideas and lots of
78:50 - things that you try are not going to
78:51 - work first try and the point is not to
78:53 - try something it doesn't work and then
78:54 - quit because that's what a beginner
78:55 - producer does uh an advanced producer
78:57 - Tres something it doesn't work owns up
78:59 - to the fact that it didn't work and try
79:01 - something else again um and I made
79:03 - plenty of hip-hop songs before but not
79:05 - every single one turns out the way I
79:06 - wanted to and not every idea turns out
79:07 - the same so what I'm going to do is I'm
79:09 - just going to find a different thing and
79:11 - see if I can make it
79:12 - [Music]
79:21 - work
79:25 - [Music]
79:30 - first of all it's because this is out of
79:31 - key so I need to fix that and then I can
79:33 - also fix it a little bit by just maybe
79:36 - clipping it here
79:38 - [Music]
79:44 - [Music]
79:51 - instead
80:00 - [Music]
80:13 - [Music]
80:21 - [Music]
80:30 - [Music]
80:52 - m
80:53 - [Music]
80:57 - so it's
80:59 - not I mean yeah this happens this is my
81:02 - like favorite song in the entire world
81:04 - um I wish I could have made something
81:06 - more interesting here I had an idea and
81:08 - I kind of lost it already because it's
81:09 - kind of taking me too long uh which
81:11 - happen so I might need to come up with a
81:12 - different new idea again I think that
81:15 - part of the issue with uh trying to show
81:16 - Advanced production live for me is uh
81:19 - that the part of my brain that explains
81:20 - and the part of my brain that produces
81:21 - two different parts and sometimes it
81:23 - takes me 5 minutes to make something
81:24 - really cool sometimes it makes me it
81:26 - takes me 2 hours and obviously I don't
81:28 - have that kind of like I don't have the
81:30 - luck that every single idea I come up
81:32 - with that hopefully while I'm making the
81:33 - tutorial live that it's going to be good
81:36 - but um that's just the way it is
81:38 - sometimes so uh hopefully by me not
81:40 - being able to make something cool you
81:41 - guys could to learn something too and
81:43 - that it's encouraging that not every
81:44 - time that you sit down at the computer
81:46 - you're going to make something but I
81:47 - forgot what saying it was but it's uh
81:49 - that sometimes that it's inevitable that
81:52 - you're going to make something something
81:52 - good you just have to sit through the
81:54 - production times of making bad things
81:56 - over and over again to get them out of
81:58 - the way until the good thing comes along
81:59 - so hopefully that's encouraging for you
82:01 - is that every time that you sit the
82:02 - computer don't expect to make something
82:03 - good but rather just go hey if I make
82:05 - something bad that's one less bad thing
82:07 - I have until I make something good so
82:09 - just think just change your mind mindset
82:11 - a little bit differently and then
82:13 - hopefully that will encourage you to
82:14 - make better things so uh I showed you
82:17 - guys about the sampler and different
82:19 - things that you can do in the sampler uh
82:21 - one thing that I really like to do also
82:22 - is is go to stretch Pro and then change
82:24 - this and this just format shifts it so
82:25 - you can have all kinds of really cool
82:26 - stuff
82:27 - [Music]
82:34 - here I still really like this beginning
82:36 - part it's really chill uh it's really
82:37 - cool so um that's just uh just another
82:41 - example just the format shifting I love
82:42 - doing that to vocals sounds really cool
82:45 - and then um putting this on stretch Pro
82:47 - also if I change this an octave down it
82:49 - won't change
82:51 - the
82:54 - but if I uh put this just on stretch
82:55 - listen into it
82:59 - now with stretch Pro it like tries to
83:02 - retain the same format it's
83:04 - [Music]
83:08 - interesting it it's quite interesting so
83:10 - I really like using the format shift the
83:11 - stretch Pro whenever they added that
83:13 - huge huge I love that update so much so
83:16 - that's just something cool uh also you
83:18 - can change the octave by uh right
83:20 - clicking on these notes this will change
83:21 - it so
83:25 - [Music]
83:28 - just another way for you to change the
83:29 - picture if you need to go a little bit
83:30 - further in pitch um anyways so I showed
83:33 - you guys how to use the sampler I showed
83:35 - you guys uh different ways that you can
83:36 - use samples in your Productions uh and I
83:38 - also showed you guys uh a little bit
83:40 - about making Melodies uh the funny thing
83:42 - was is that uh pretty much all the
83:43 - Melodies I made today were not good and
83:44 - then all the samples I tried using in
83:46 - production also weren't good but I did
83:48 - like this um this one percussion Loop
83:50 - here editing that to make it fit with
83:51 - this beginning part that at least was
83:53 - kind of interesting um so hopefully you
83:55 - guys got to saw a little bit of that U
83:57 - maybe I could pull up another production
83:58 - and then show you guys a different
84:00 - example of something that I did turn out
84:02 - well and then we'll go with that right
84:07 - now all right so I found a project that
84:09 - I worked on and this was something I
84:11 - made a little while ago and this shows a
84:12 - better example of how you can use
84:14 - samples and Melodies uh more effectively
84:16 - and just making a very simple production
84:18 - so this was just a very basic idea I
84:19 - made so this was a sample I made
84:25 - [Music]
84:35 - and that come from and that came from
84:44 - [Music]
84:51 - this and I love that was a weird ending
84:54 - uh I love uh using these samples just as
84:57 - quick idea starters for me um they
84:59 - really help me when I making music but
85:01 - this is something uh that I made uh it
85:03 - just has a few different patterns so
85:05 - this is one of
85:12 - them so you see I have multiple layers
85:15 - going on at the same time so I have
85:16 - let's just play the bass in this
85:21 - one
85:23 - so you see I have a call it's kind of
85:25 - like asking a
85:27 - question you can almost see that this
85:29 - this first part right here is just
85:31 - asking a
85:33 - question and then this is an
85:36 - answer this ask the same question
85:39 - again but with a different base so it's
85:41 - like almost like a different I don't
85:42 - even know and then a different
85:45 - answer and then it plays the same again
85:47 - goes over
85:50 - again and then add
85:52 - the same thing
85:54 - again with a different base pattern and
85:56 - then finishes off by the kind of
85:58 - completing the whole
86:00 - thing and then it repeats the whole
86:06 - thing and then I have a different
86:09 - completely different pattern going in
86:10 - the background
86:11 - this so as you can see I have a counter
86:14 - Melody here I have my main Melody here
86:16 - and I have my 808 base just playing a
86:19 - very simple Melody here and when all
86:21 - these things combine I with the melody
86:22 - and the counter Melody and the Basse you
86:24 - have a full uh more complete track and
86:26 - then what I did was I actually exported
86:28 - that Melody out and then messed with it
86:30 - around by pitching it down and changing
86:32 - the way it was formed and stuff and then
86:34 - added tons of effects to it
86:35 - [Music]
86:39 - so you see add these kind of
86:42 - effects I could have made it even more
86:44 - interesting by adding like a
86:46 - [Music]
86:48 - chorus done all kinds of stuff I could
86:50 - have done like update
86:54 - [Music]
86:56 - presser try
86:59 - [Music]
87:14 - that that might be a little bit too much
87:16 - but you know what there's like different
87:17 - things you can try here so uh try
87:19 - sampling your own Melodies so like make
87:21 - melodies a sample out of it by going up
87:23 - here right clicking going to consolidate
87:26 - track and then from track start or song
87:27 - Start whichever one you'd like and then
87:29 - what that's going to do is is going to
87:30 - consolidate that into a meel uh into a
87:32 - sample and then you can use that sample
87:34 - to either develop your own sample packs
87:36 - or to make your own tracks and that's
87:38 - what I mostly use it for so I hopefully
87:41 - this was a better example than me uh
87:43 - failing multiple times on how to make uh
87:45 - Melodies and how to uh make just beats
87:46 - and just like um uh how to use samples
87:49 - uh in your Productions but hopefully
87:51 - this was a uh a good um a better example
87:54 - of what can happen so uh and notice that
87:56 - I made this probably when I wasn't
87:57 - recording and when I was just kind of
87:59 - like oh I have this idea in my head and
88:00 - then it just kind of happen so um those
88:02 - are two different ways that you can
88:04 - produce and so hopefully that was more
88:06 - helpful for you
88:08 - [Music]
88:10 - uh you may have been wondering why it
88:13 - took me so long to release this course
88:15 - and I want to tell you I have tried
88:16 - recording this course so many times and
88:18 - just to prove it I'm actually going to
88:19 - show you one of the versions of this
88:21 - course and never got released it was me
88:22 - making a 1hour challenge and then that
88:24 - 1hour challenge I was going to take and
88:26 - then collab with my friend who's going
88:28 - to record vocals his guitar we're going
88:29 - to record all everything and then we're
88:30 - going to finish that song and then I was
88:32 - going to analyze the collab edit that we
88:35 - did together as the final uh thing for
88:37 - the for the full Advanced uh uh tutorial
88:41 - so I thought hey why not just add that
88:43 - onto the tutorial I've already gotten
88:44 - finished so I did so I'm added after
88:47 - this you're going to see a another 1our
88:49 - section of me making a 1 hour challenge
88:51 - just to show you what the advanced uh
88:52 - production technique looks like when
88:54 - it's condensed into a shorter time frame
88:56 - and I you can tell in that video I was
88:58 - really not feeling it I was like I I
88:59 - don't know if this is going to turn into
89:00 - anything I was just I was nervous I
89:02 - wasn't sure I record the video so many
89:04 - times I was like it's probably just be
89:05 - another take I'm not going to use but I
89:07 - am going to use it and you know what I'm
89:08 - going to show you what the final track
89:10 - between uh me and blender base turned
89:12 - out like and it's not even close to
89:13 - finished which is sad but hey it happens
89:16 - uh and the project file that I have is
89:19 - uh kind of I'm going to try to find it
89:20 - I'm going to try to reop it and then
89:22 - I'll analyze that after I show you the 1
89:24 - hour challenge and then I'll try to do
89:25 - that as well just to kind of finish out
89:27 - on a strong note so without further Ado
89:29 - uh I'm just going to play this uh
89:31 - version of the song and then uh I will
89:33 - show you the 1 hour challenge and from
89:35 - there I will go into the project for
89:37 - this one hour challenge that is
89:38 - corrupted and some of it doesn't work
89:40 - but I still want to show you at least
89:41 - what we got done um so I'll play this
89:43 - and then you can see the one hour
89:44 - challenge and see how it cut to this
89:46 - point all
89:50 - right

91:23 - [Music]
91:46 - [Music]
91:50 - to
91:51 - [Music]
92:20 - oh
92:33 - [Music]
92:46 - [Music]
92:50 - a
92:55 - [Music]
93:09 - anyways so that is super crazy uh super
93:11 - interesting a lot of it is like stuff
93:13 - I've never made before he's never made
93:15 - before it's just like this crazy idea is
93:17 - Just Happening uh a lot of it is like
93:19 - really experimental is the word I'd use
93:21 - it's not like something you listen to on
93:22 - the radio it's kind of like what is this
93:23 - like I've never heard anything like this
93:25 - but it's cool it's it's fun to make
93:26 - stuff like this um anyways uh so now
93:29 - here's the one hour challenge and when
93:31 - you come back from this and see what I
93:32 - worked on for an hour you can see what
93:34 - uh blend base uh helps collab on so
93:36 - let's let's check it
93:38 - out
93:40 - okay okay so my first attempt I forgot
93:43 - to hit the timer so I'm gonna have to
93:45 - restart so this is going to be attempt
93:46 - two so let me repare my
93:48 - notepad this is attempt two and this
93:51 - time I'm actually going to start the
93:52 - timer let's just open up a new thing of
93:55 - FL
93:56 - FL
94:00 - fresh and then we're just going to
94:01 - collapse everything in the
94:03 - browser all
94:06 - right now I'm just going to hit the
94:08 - timer and we are going to go so let's
94:10 - try this again attempt two this time I
94:13 - hit the timer so I'm actually doing the
94:15 - challenge that's unfortunate uh okay so
94:18 - I'm going to start off last time we
94:20 - started off with the drums and it's kind
94:22 - of sounded interesting but this time I
94:23 - want to start off with a piano so we're
94:25 - going to do a little bit
94:26 - different
94:28 - um let's see I want to pick something
94:31 - cool like I want to make something
94:32 - that's
94:34 - like like house drums but like
94:37 - acoustic so I want to try something
94:40 - interesting
94:41 - basically go here let me turn my
94:44 - notifications off on my phone so
94:47 - Focus uh can Volver I highly recommend I
94:50 - actually when I would produce I put my
94:51 - phone in a different room it was
94:53 - actually really helpful um but I mean
94:55 - obviously if you have people that you
94:56 - need be into contact with obviously keep
94:58 - your phone with you
95:01 - okay let's stick this
95:12 - here
95:13 - [Music]
95:20 - okay

97:55 - this is like your stereotypical pop song
97:57 - if I've ever heard it okay let's get
98:00 - started uh this is let's just keep it
98:03 - with the piano honestly this is going to
98:04 - be just keep things simpler um the only
98:07 - thing that could make this more
98:08 - stereotypical is if I added rain so
98:09 - let's do that um let's go to recordings
98:14 - no no just kidding not there
98:17 - um where is it my samples rendered
98:22 - [Music]
98:30 - also if you notice I don't talk a lot
98:32 - when I produce this is uh the problem
98:34 - every almost every single time I
98:35 - recorded this is that uh I found that I
98:39 - literally barely talk when I'm trying to
98:40 - make music so when I start explaining I
98:43 - actually do worse so that being said uh
98:45 - if I'm quiet for most of the time uh the
98:47 - second half is going to be more me
98:48 - explaining this as I said before so
98:50 - that's why I'm trying to separate in my
98:52 - head that way I can focus on just making
98:53 - good music okay let's add another
98:57 - Labs no just kidding it's going to
99:01 - be I need like a
99:05 - really really electric

108:35 - accidentally hit the Z key on my
108:37 - keyboard with the the clap and it
108:39 - sounded so cool hold on that could be
108:42 - like a snare sample
108:48 - right ooh

108:55 - going um
109:01 - 140 I like that a
109:07 - [Music]

109:39 - 1 billion per so I'm going to take the
109:41 - chords here paste in the melody and see
109:44 - what it tells me a Maj for sure okay for
109:47 - sure for sure a
109:48 - Maj okay I can see if I have a vocal and
109:51 - aart major and waste a little bit of
109:52 - time yeah I'm going to do that okay
109:54 - let's go to ad adsr sample manager I
109:56 - can't remember if I already explained
109:57 - this because I know I for sure did in
109:59 - the first first tutorial but I mean the
110:02 - first attempt of this but I don't know
110:03 - if I have used this yet so I'm just
110:05 - going to look up another air
110:09 - major it's crazy like when I actually
110:12 - just focus on making music and like and
110:14 - not explaining everything I swear I make
110:16 - like 10 times better stuff okay I'm
110:19 - going to look up
110:21 - vocal there's literally only one vocal
110:24 - in each chart
110:27 - [Music]
110:34 - maybe I don't really like
110:38 - it put a major as well and I'll also
110:44 - do I want multiple multiple
110:49 - keys it's fine could be a different key
110:52 - it's not big
110:54 - [Music]

125:22 - [Music]
125:33 - [Music]
125:49 - [Music]
126:07 - [Music]
126:18 - [Music]
126:24 - [Music]
126:38 - [Music]
126:48 - w
126:54 - [Music]
127:22 - [Music]
127:28 - it's just so
127:33 - [Music]
127:44 - bad
127:47 - okay
128:11 - [Music]
128:17 - for
128:24 - [Music]
128:31 - [Music]
128:56 - okay so so far we have a fairly boring
129:00 - is like okay so we have like an
129:08 - [Music]
129:16 - intro I can imagine a vocal
129:21 - [Music]
129:24 - here I don't actually normally make
129:27 - hip-hop so this is like really
129:27 - interesting I actually don't know what
129:28 - to do after this like I could try to
129:31 - make a drop um but I started at 140 BPM
129:34 - so it's like weird like can't do
129:37 - house
129:40 - um let's see I really want to look at my
129:42 - timer but I know I'm not supposed to
129:47 - okay
129:49 - I guess I
129:53 - [Music]
129:58 - could okay I'm going to take a second to
130:00 - just sit back and like think about this
130:01 - while I listen to
130:13 - [Music]
130:17 - it
130:23 - [Music]
130:33 - [Music]
130:52 - [Music]
131:06 - [Music]
131:21 - [Music]
131:25 - I think a vocal would really help me
131:27 - right now come up with ideas I usually
131:29 - what I do is I'll have like kind of like
131:31 - a base idea like this send it to a
131:33 - vocalist and then as soon as I get it
131:34 - back I like have a billion ideas this
131:37 - it's without a vocal it's hard sometimes
131:39 - to think about like what to do next um
131:42 - also I think the timer definitely makes
131:45 - me it's harder to focus on like just
131:49 - like ideas and stuff because you're like
131:50 - you don't want to waste time
131:52 - [Music]
131:58 - um since this is
132:00 - so unique in a way I don't really know
132:03 - how the arrangement is supposed to go I
132:05 - mean I guess I could strip it down even
132:06 - more in the beginning I could like move
132:08 - this forward just have
132:11 - [Music]
132:15 - this do something like that
132:20 - and then you could literally just fade
132:21 - it in over
132:23 - [Music]
132:47 - time
132:50 - [Music]
133:13 - [Music]
133:46 - [Music]
133:53 - that's
133:54 - clean you know you know it is um okay so
133:58 - I got that would also kind of sound cool
134:09 - [Music]
134:16 - here
134:19 - [Music]
134:28 - the chords okay so sometimes this is a
134:30 - great uh a great point to sometimes you
134:33 - need to know when to let your ideas die
134:35 - cuz those chords are too low pitched I
134:36 - knew they were I tried eqing them out
134:38 - but you just notice that they just
134:39 - weren't fitting in the mix and if
134:40 - something's not fitting you just need to
134:41 - cut it uh that just needs to be cut I
134:43 - should have done that a long time ago so
134:45 - let me listen to this
134:46 - again
134:50 - this is a boring sound I need to change
134:53 - it uh but instead of changing it what
134:55 - I'm going to do is I'm going to copy it
134:57 - paste it mute it so I'm just going to
134:59 - clone
135:00 - it copy it paste it mute it and then I'm
135:04 - going to go to this and then I can
135:05 - change this without changing what I had
135:07 - before
135:16 - so
135:20 - [Music]
135:29 - [Music]
135:42 - [Music]
135:46 - yeah
135:48 - [Music]
135:54 - [Music]
136:06 - [Music]
136:13 - [Music]
136:16 - n
136:20 - [Music]
136:34 - [Music]
136:41 - [Music]
136:46 - n
136:48 - [Music]
136:55 - [Music]
137:03 - [Music]
137:08 - I could even turn back on
137:13 - [Music]
137:16 - this
137:20 - [Music]
137:30 - um so my initial idea was that I was
137:33 - going to be
137:34 - like I should do this on piano because
137:36 - if I show you guys on piano maybe it
137:38 - would make more sense like what my
137:39 - initial idea was so what I really wanted
137:40 - to do
137:42 - was I wanted to have it be like uh let
137:46 - me sh for you by getting the melody as
137:49 - well
137:51 - here um so like my idea was it was going
137:54 - to be
137:56 - [Music]
137:58 - like and then it would be
138:01 - [Music]
138:04 - like
138:09 - [Music]
138:16 - like
138:18 - not like that
138:20 - [Music]
138:28 - [Music]
138:36 - like it's going to be like let
138:43 - see
138:46 - maybe
138:48 - [Music]
138:55 - Maybe not maybe not it's
138:58 - fine I like the I like the kind of drops
139:01 - where like it has cords and a lead but
139:02 - they're not going at the same time
139:04 - they're kind of like bouncing back and
139:05 - forth that could be cool um I could look
139:09 - at my time and then just call it or I
139:11 - could keep going and if I keep going I'm
139:13 - trying to figure out what I do
139:16 - because
139:20 - I can mess around with different
139:29 - [Music]
139:39 - Keys that's just way to low though now
139:42 - so if I go sounds really cool for like
139:44 - the first hit but then these these notes
139:45 - are too low so I need to go back up
139:54 - [Music]
139:58 - to be real with you a sharp is a bit too
140:01 - low I don't like to go below D sharp so
140:05 - yeah D is kind of lowest I like to go
140:07 - with my with my base dsh D that's
140:11 - usually the lowest you can go without it
140:13 - sounding like weird in the sub area I
140:14 - don't know why it's just that is always
140:16 - like that
140:19 - um I don't know I don't
140:23 - know I think it's good it's all right um
140:27 - let's see the timer 13 minutes I'm just
140:29 - going to stop it I'm going to stop it
140:30 - right there and you know what we'll say
140:32 - that that was a temp that was attempt
140:34 - two got get back to my Apple CIO here
140:38 - okay so let's talk about this for a
140:39 - second
140:40 - so um what I did was I I love doing this
140:44 - little intro thing so what I do is I
140:45 - take fic involver and I will put on my
140:48 - master and put it to the pink noise
140:50 - preset okay and then what that does is
140:53 - essentially like if you
140:55 - listen it blows everything out like in
140:59 - terms of
141:03 - the and it just creates this really warm
141:06 - like I could honestly I could even do
141:07 - this like this would probably make it
141:09 - sound really good yeah like this this
141:11 - right
141:12 - [Music]
141:16 - here
141:19 - yeah yeah yeah like something like this
141:21 - would be
141:22 - perfect so you just kind of take these
141:25 - two
141:27 - [Music]
141:34 - boom and it gives you like a hint of the
141:38 - future like song of like what it's going
141:40 - to be but it doesn't quite give it away
141:41 - yet cuz it's like all reverbed out so
141:43 - you can't really tell um I like starting
141:46 - in with the Basse and the drums and
141:47 - immediately off the start you want to
141:48 - hook in your
141:50 - listener another way we could hook in
141:52 - The Listener here
141:53 - is from the started here we could have a
141:56 - a reverse that kind of goes into it so
141:59 - um if I had like some type of uh what's
142:02 - it called
142:03 - sweep
142:06 - uplifter perfect just something like
142:08 - this very
142:11 - [Music]
142:16 - simple
142:23 - [Music]
142:29 - [Music]
142:34 - see how much of a big difference that
142:35 - makes
142:37 - [Music]
142:46 - just
142:52 - uh every eight bars you want to add
142:53 - something new this is constant so
142:56 - honestly if I really want to make this
142:57 - interesting I can probably take these
142:58 - vocal things for right now and then just
142:59 - leave it like
143:00 - [Music]
143:15 - this oh vocal thing and I think they
143:17 - sound cool I also speed up the base here
143:19 - um that's just to kind of give a little
143:21 - bit more movement cuz you don't want to
143:22 - ever stay like stagnant so like I can
143:24 - make this super boring like I just keep
143:25 - this the same too and then I like didn't
143:28 - do anything new in this part other than
143:30 - maybe add the
143:33 - chords like it's fine but
143:35 - [Applause]
143:36 - this it just picks it up a notch I think
143:39 - that this is huge um and then obviously
143:42 - when I get into this
143:44 - part this is just a huge producer life
143:47 - hack if you just take out all the
143:49 - volume right before the the drop it
143:51 - makes it hit just that much harder so I
143:53 - think that's that's cool um I want to
143:56 - add in some saturation so I didn't
143:58 - really add any saturation to
144:02 - this that's like a million times better
144:05 - already I can't believe I didn't do that
144:06 - before um so yeah saturation to your uh
144:09 - subbase it just adds those extra
144:11 - harmonic so like we go into the sub face
144:12 - right
144:14 - [Music]
144:16 - here
144:19 - and for those of you saying that I my uh
144:21 - my subbase is wide uh it is not actually
144:23 - I'm using Bas Lane and what this does is
144:25 - it widens certain bands of frequencies
144:28 - over other bands so I'm actually
144:29 - widening 500 htz right here on my sub
144:32 - which is like really interesting because
144:33 - it means that the subfrequencies are
144:34 - going to stay low so like I could
144:35 - literally take a midside EQ here like if
144:38 - I go to Patcher and I go to uh
144:43 - midside uh I made this preset and I'll
144:45 - just straight up give you the uh guys
144:47 - this for free uh this is so helpful and
144:49 - I want you guys to have it um it so
144:52 - basically
144:53 - [Music]
144:55 - like that's without the
144:57 - [Music]
144:58 - wide hear the difference and then I can
145:00 - literally take out the the lows and the
145:02 - highs and it literally will sound no
145:03 - different
145:04 - [Music]
145:15 - because
145:23 - interesting huh I guess this 808 has a
145:25 - little bit of width in the bottom that's
145:27 - fine uh it still sounds good so I'm not
145:29 - going to fuss over it too much I mean if
145:31 - you really were worried about the 808
145:33 - sounding wi in the bottom I guess you
145:34 - could always put it
145:37 - mon it still hits that's fine uh so yeah
145:42 - I like I like the way that that sounds
145:43 - so uh I also really like using that in
145:45 - general just so I could put like a
145:47 - Patcher here with my midside EQ preset
145:50 - and if you do this um like I don't know
145:53 - why I need to resave this preset where
145:55 - the stereo is on the bottom uh basically
145:57 - it splits the bands into a midside EQ
146:00 - basically means that you can take the
146:02 - the frequencies that are in mono and mix
146:04 - them separately from the side
146:05 - frequencies so that's what this bar is
146:07 - right here so when I turn this wide it
146:08 - makes things get wider and when I put it
146:10 - this way it makes this mono so the
146:12 - reason I have it like that is so that I
146:14 - can mix these separately so like listen
146:19 - [Music]
146:30 - [Music]
146:40 - [Music]
146:45 - boring
146:48 - way more interesting because I'm
146:49 - boosting the highs and that just kind of
146:51 - like tingles your ears okay
146:54 - [Music]
146:57 - so I would side chain the Basse but I've
146:59 - noticed for a lot of hip-hop producers
147:00 - they actually don't side chain the Basse
147:02 - in the kick and for some reason it makes
147:03 - it distort when the kick hits the base
147:04 - and it sounds actually cooler uh so like
147:06 - if I were to side chain this it would
147:08 - just kind of lack that kind of uh messy
147:12 - energy like where it just like
147:13 - everything's just kind of hitting into
147:15 - each other like that sounds cool for
147:16 - hipop so I've kind of noticed this is
147:18 - kind of a thing to
147:19 - do if I take
147:21 - [Music]
147:24 - that and then I might
147:27 - just oh that's the vocal what am I doing
147:29 - where's
147:31 - [Music]
147:33 - the I might add it like a transpire on
147:36 - this and then just
147:39 - [Music]
147:40 - boost add a little bit of
147:45 - saturation
147:47 - oh that's on the wrong thing so funny
147:51 - that's fine I actually never put these
147:53 - on mixture tracks that's
147:56 - crazy let's put that on the mixure track
147:58 - here we
148:00 - go
148:01 - [Music]
148:15 - um
148:20 - [Music]
148:29 - [Music]
148:31 - okay it's funny because I'm doing like
148:33 - this one hour challenge but I literally
148:35 - like just woke up I'm just going right
148:37 - into it right in the morning uh I
148:39 - usually produce like really late at
148:41 - night I would like to hear when you guys
148:43 - like to produce I I made some of my best
148:45 - tracks at like 4:00 a.m. in the morning
148:46 - it's hilarious obviously it's not good
148:48 - for your sleep but I mean yeah um okay
148:52 - so what else can we can we talk about
148:54 - about this so uh we talked about the
148:56 - progression and how we just want to kind
148:57 - of increase energy over time but also
148:58 - keep the listener engaged you want to
149:00 - change things uh eight bars uh like keep
149:03 - something changing all the way through
149:05 - uh I think some other things that
149:07 - intermediate producers I notic struggle
149:09 - with is that yeah with one thing is
149:12 - keeping things interesting um hooking
149:14 - The Listener right away uh not having to
149:17 - keep everything all the time so I don't
149:18 - actually need this melody playing the
149:20 - whole time I could actually take this
149:21 - out
149:25 - like and this would actually be really
149:27 - good because what I can do is I could
149:28 - have a singer on here and they could be
149:30 - like singing here and just doing their
149:32 - thing just have the melody coming in
149:34 - that beginning part and then just have
149:35 - the singer come in
149:36 - [Music]
149:41 - here I can't sing but if I would sing it
149:44 - would yeah it probably wouldn't sound
149:46 - good so
149:47 - uh let's
149:48 - see and then you bring in the melody
149:50 - here and then you're like okay that
149:52 - leads you into it and then I could
149:53 - completely change the melody here too
149:55 - like just for for instance like we could
149:56 - literally
149:57 - just change the whole thing right
150:01 - here could be fun let's just
150:15 - try
150:18 - [Music]
150:29 - never mind we're not going to
150:31 - change
150:39 - uh okay so another thing is that be
150:43 - cognizant of What BPM you're in in what
150:46 - kind of stuff that you're making because
150:47 - obviously like I can't make house at 140
150:49 - so like just keep it consistent in terms
150:51 - of like what you're trying to do I think
150:53 - that that's uh some people like they'll
150:55 - don't change to BPM during your track
150:57 - it's confusing for The Listener
150:59 - um like I would stick to like kind of
151:02 - one whole idea uh per track if you have
151:06 - like four ideas going on in a track like
151:08 - it's going to just confuse the listener
151:09 - so um I wasn't doing anything crazy here
151:12 - uh I started making hip-hop because I
151:13 - was at 140 and I just stuck with it I
151:15 - didn't change BPM I could have I could
151:17 - have like maybe I could like turn it
151:19 - down
151:21 - to I don't really want to do that
151:22 - because I stretch everything but that's
151:24 - fine just leave it how it is uh I'm
151:26 - trying to think it's it's also harder
151:28 - for me to give advice with hip-hop music
151:29 - because I don't actually make a lot of
151:30 - it uh I make a lot of future balance in
151:33 - like different uh EDM genres but I've
151:36 - been trying to do more hip-hop because
151:37 - it's it's it's a lot of fun to produce
151:40 - um so let me let me think
151:45 - typically
151:46 - what you saw me uh mess around with
151:48 - these vocal samples uh don't look at
151:50 - something immediately and just go like
151:52 - no try to see like the potential and
151:54 - like things that you could use so you
151:55 - saw the vocal s pi and you're probably
151:56 - like e that does not fit at all but I
151:58 - heard something in there and I was able
151:59 - to pull it out to make something kind of
152:01 - cool so like now we have
152:04 - this and that adds a huge just like
152:07 - background
152:10 - element also another thing is that
152:12 - notice how I just because I found
152:14 - something cool I didn't have to use it
152:15 - constant l so like this crush this was
152:19 - like this little uh um this thing that
152:22 - like uh I forgot what what the term is
152:24 - called but it has a certain effect on
152:26 - the vocals that I liked but I didn't
152:27 - want it the whole
152:29 - time see it's not
152:33 - there and doing these kind of things
152:36 - where you don't do it all the time adds
152:38 - a lot of progression to your uh to your
152:40 - music so like taking out the rain sounds
152:42 - in in the drop here if I kept them
152:45 - in
152:47 - it's just kind of more going on if I
152:49 - take it
152:50 - out it just has that more of that drop
152:52 - in feel where like you're hearing a lots
152:54 - of sound
152:55 - [Music]
152:58 - here I could honestly I
153:01 - [Music]
153:06 - could you could even do like a fake out
153:08 - there there's so many potential things
153:09 - you could do but once you like kind of
153:11 - like suck everything out once it's like
153:13 - it's all like sustained and then like
153:15 - you can just take cut everything and
153:17 - then it hits so much harder so uh that's
153:20 - that's one huge thing uh one thing I
153:21 - didn't do which I could show you guys is
153:23 - if a really cool trick basically you're
153:25 - going to go to your master create an
153:27 - automation clip and then create one
153:28 - automation clip on on the stereo as well
153:31 - and then what you do is for the stereo
153:32 - separation you're going to put it up
153:33 - like just maybe like halfway and then
153:36 - for the volume you're going to go down
153:37 - like three
153:39 - Deb do that do that and
153:42 - then check this
153:45 - out
153:46 - [Music]
153:49 - okay that might be a little bit too much
153:50 - on the volume side let me one
153:52 - sec go like right
153:56 - here you don't want to do the volume too
153:58 - much on the master but just as the
154:00 - [Music]
154:02 - effect everything kind of goes lower and
154:05 - like more in in your
154:08 - headphones and then it like widens out
154:10 - last second it's super cool I love doing
154:12 - that so that's another cool trick that
154:13 - you guys can
154:14 - do um
154:16 - let's see for 1 hour challenge or I
154:19 - guess like a 50 minute 45 minute I mean
154:22 - I didn't really I wasn't really
154:22 - producing the last 5 minutes I was kind
154:24 - of just thinking
154:26 - uh I guess yeah uh don't be afraid to
154:29 - use Loops right here I just wanted to
154:30 - save time and it was a cool idea and it
154:32 - sounded nice so I just kept it in there
154:33 - it's not a big deal um using Loops can
154:35 - just give you a lot of creativity and
154:38 - freedom free up the mind to do other
154:40 - ideas um let's see here I have like AAR
154:42 - major I could add in like other stuff so
154:44 - like let's find another sample that
154:45 - sounds cool with this so I go back to
154:47 - adsr sample manager and I'm just going
154:49 - to repeat this part right
154:51 - here and then what I'm going to do is
154:53 - I'm going to go only on loops and I'm
154:55 - only going to search up a major samples
154:58 - and just literally play them with the
155:01 - song and this can lead to all kinds of
155:04 - [Music]
155:15 - ideas
155:20 - [Music]
155:33 - [Music]
155:52 - H this sounds interesting I know it
155:54 - doesn't fit in how it is but I think
155:56 - like if I like let me show you an
155:58 - example something so like let's say I
155:59 - have some a sample that doesn't quite
156:01 - fit and you can do things to make it fit
156:05 - sometimes so like I can take
156:10 - out so like maybe that doesn't work but
156:13 - maybe I can like
156:17 - take this and like pitch it
156:21 - [Music]
156:27 - up never know just do something like
156:32 - [Music]
156:41 - that maybe not I I always like to check
156:44 - so sometimes I'll just throw samples in
156:46 - there and like sometimes you get lucky
156:47 - and you're like oh wow that sounded like
156:48 - perfect and then you can just keep it as
156:50 - like a background element or just like
156:52 - uh just something for uh one half of the
156:53 - arrangement so um don't uh if you ever
156:57 - are like looking for new ideas and
156:58 - you're just like I'm stuck at this like
157:00 - try throwing in a sample or two and just
157:01 - see like if it spark some idea and even
157:03 - if you don't use the sample you can
157:05 - always use it to make something else
157:06 - that's similar or like that you think
157:08 - would lead to a cooler idea so uh that's
157:11 - like another cool trick I'm trying to
157:12 - like I think one huge thing for uh
157:16 - moving from the kind of beginner
157:17 - intermediate to Advanced stages is that
157:20 - you need uh need to feel more
157:22 - comfortable working faster so you
157:23 - probably saw in this my workflow was 10
157:26 - times faster than my beginner tutorial
157:27 - and that's because I wasn't limited by
157:28 - having to explain every single thing I
157:30 - did I'm just kind of assuming that you
157:31 - guys already know what you're doing so I
157:33 - could just zoom through all this like
157:35 - like just click through everything and
157:37 - even though I'm going quickly if you
157:38 - watch How I go quickly then you are able
157:41 - to probably copy me later and then
157:43 - that'll help you guys improve as well so
157:45 - uh I'm trying a different method of uh
157:48 - just basically teaching a lesson here
157:50 - because uh the first way I did it in the
157:51 - beginner of tutorial I thought was
157:52 - helpful if you'd never produced before
157:54 - but if you are producing I think trying
157:57 - to think about the things that you don't
157:59 - know like there's a lot of things that
158:00 - you just don't know and uh basically how
158:03 - it was for me is I look up tutorials and
158:05 - I try to find things that they could
158:08 - inform me on that I didn't already know
158:09 - but a lot of times they were just
158:10 - telling me how to do something rather
158:12 - than telling me the why behind it and so
158:15 - I like like explaining the reasons of
158:17 - why I do things rather than giving you
158:19 - like a technical explanation a lot of
158:20 - times because that'll be more beneficial
158:22 - to you in the long run so let me give
158:24 - you a good example of this I could like
158:26 - one technical thing I told you guys was
158:27 - about the involver trick and that's
158:30 - practical you could use that in your own
158:31 - um but it doesn't tell you why I did I
158:34 - did this and if I explain why I did it
158:35 - if I if I say okay I want to give
158:37 - contrast from the inro of the song and
158:40 - then draw the listener's ear in right as
158:42 - the song starts so that it starts off on
158:45 - the beat like immediately so I have no
158:48 - kicks no drums going on
158:51 - here and then
158:53 - immediately that's going to draw The
158:55 - Listener in okay in the first five
158:56 - seconds of the song uh it's the same
158:58 - idea here where I take out
159:00 - everything this part and then this
159:03 - beginning part are the same thing
159:04 - they're the same concept uh and doing it
159:07 - right before the transition from the
159:09 - bridge the chorus and from the I mean
159:11 - not the bridge my bad um the buildups to
159:14 - the chorus and the intro to or I guess
159:17 - the starting intro to the intro gives
159:19 - that same effect of the the why behind
159:21 - it would be I want to uh create a not
159:24 - necessarily a surprise but something
159:26 - that catches the the listener's ear
159:28 - immediately so that's something to think
159:30 - about so I think that that that's the
159:32 - reason I like doing this convolver trip
159:33 - for instance another way I could help
159:35 - you guys with like a technical thing
159:37 - balance with the reason for why I do it
159:39 - is uh I think I explained that with the
159:41 - with the crush technique is that I
159:43 - didn't we're not just I'm not teaching
159:45 - you just oh use Crush it's cool fore
159:47 - plugin and if you do this effect it's
159:48 - cool uh basically I was like okay well
159:51 - once you find something cool um I didn't
159:53 - want to do it all the time because it
159:55 - doesn't keep the song interesting so
159:57 - keeping the song flowing and moving so
159:58 - that the listener wants to keep
160:00 - listening uh you want to add change
160:02 - throughout your song So if I just kept
160:03 - this the same the whole time it would
160:05 - just sound it wouldn't be bad it just
160:07 - would be less interesting so if I mean
160:09 - if I just keep it
160:11 - [Music]
160:14 - on
160:16 - [Music]
160:20 - I mean it doesn't the weird thing is
160:22 - that there's a lot of things in music
160:23 - that don't sound bad so you can leave
160:25 - them like that but then until you do
160:27 - something different that sounds better
160:28 - then you're like oh that sounds even
160:30 - better and that's why uh I highly
160:31 - recommend that you guys collaborate with
160:33 - artists find people your skill level and
160:34 - then just ask them you have to kind of
160:36 - just take a leap and just be like hey
160:38 - man you want to make you want to make a
160:39 - song and then just do that and I think
160:41 - that that would be it would be so
160:43 - helpful for you guys I remember I just
160:44 - join a bunch of discords and I'd
160:45 - literally just sit in a Discord with
160:47 - like five people and we'd all make music
160:49 - like dead silent while we're making
160:50 - music and then we'd like DM each other
160:51 - later like hey you want to make a song
160:52 - and then that's that's literally like
160:54 - how I learned how to make music I think
160:56 - it's one of the best ways too because
160:57 - you're matching people with your skill
160:59 - level and then working with them uh will
161:01 - help you all improve um as you keep
161:04 - practicing together uh and then what you
161:06 - want to do is just keep making friends
161:07 - with better and better producers and
161:08 - then just keep working up and building
161:10 - your skills and slowly by slowly you'll
161:12 - meet uh like people that are a little
161:14 - bit better than you that maybe have
161:16 - already released on a label and they'll
161:18 - want to uh be with you I mean if you're
161:19 - just a nice person and you're fun to
161:21 - hang out with um it's really easy to
161:22 - make friends with uh good producers and
161:24 - just uh learning and get better so I
161:25 - think one super underrated tip where
161:28 - like you might go on YouTube and you
161:29 - might look up for like tutorials on how
161:31 - to become a better producer and they
161:32 - might give you all these mixing
161:33 - techniques and I did I I told you about
161:35 - Patcher and midside Q is massive it's so
161:37 - helpful but it's not going to turn you
161:40 - into professional just knowing midside
161:41 - of Q what will really turn you into
161:43 - professional is making connections with
161:45 - artists that are uh bigger than you and
161:46 - just uh having having your name out
161:49 - there a little bit more and just knowing
161:50 - people um and I mean if that if that's
161:53 - your goal that's that's really the what
161:54 - you want to do um there was this really
161:56 - good artist and he gave me advice he
161:58 - basically told me he said the difference
162:00 - between um a good producer and a great
162:02 - producer has uh how did he put it he
162:05 - didn't say he basically said um it
162:08 - doesn't have to do with technical
162:09 - ability or anything he said I've seen uh
162:11 - good artists that are way more
162:12 - technically better than professional
162:14 - artists I've seen professional artists
162:15 - that
162:16 - are vice versa you know um but his his
162:20 - point was is that it's not necessarily
162:22 - about the technical ability but also the
162:23 - knowledge and the skills of uh being an
162:25 - artist are different than just technical
162:27 - ability so knowing music theory doesn't
162:29 - make you a professional artist uh
162:31 - knowing the whole all of FO Studio
162:33 - doesn't make you a professional artist
162:34 - and so that's why I would say that I I
162:36 - am a professional music producer but I
162:38 - wouldn't say I'm a professional artists
162:40 - um there's a big difference because I I
162:41 - just haven't released music so I can't
162:44 - really be considered a professional
162:45 - artist even though I've made hundreds
162:47 - and hundreds of songs and I made songs
162:48 - for clients and I've done all that I I
162:50 - wouldn't be technically considered a
162:52 - professional musician simply because I
162:54 - don't have professionally released Songs
162:55 - so I would really like to do that um but
162:59 - obviously just haven't figured out
163:01 - exactly what Nisha I want to uh start in
163:02 - and what kind of music I want to make I
163:04 - mean even you saw even this one hour
163:05 - challenge I wasn't really sure what I
163:06 - was making it like turned into hip-hop
163:08 - but I don't really like to make hip-hop
163:10 - all that often so um I digress uh so
163:16 - just trying to think of more Advanced
163:17 - Techniques uh in the last uh attempt of
163:21 - this this is attempt two in the last
163:22 - attempt what I did was I actually used
163:24 - Edison to record a sound desize session
163:27 - so like let me let me show you what I
163:28 - mean I'll literally stick Edison on my
163:30 - master
163:31 - here
163:33 - uh actually let's save this and just go
163:35 - out of the file I think that I pretty
163:37 - much showed also happy accidents by Ross
163:39 - moment when I accidentally hit my
163:40 - keyboard and made that cool
163:44 - snare
163:49 - that was so cool I'm like so happy I did
163:50 - that that was like such an awesome I'm
163:52 - going to do that my other tracks I
163:53 - didn't even know that that could sound
163:54 - that cool is this just on
163:58 - c yeah it literally is it's just one
164:00 - octave below so if I put these on the
164:05 - same yeah that's so cool that's
164:07 - hilarious um okay so let's go into a new
164:11 - template I just want to show you guys
164:12 - some stuff so this that was kind of like
164:15 - my reflection on the one hour challenge
164:16 - uh I also just want to show you guys
164:18 - other Advanced Techniques that I think
164:20 - would be really helpful to you so I
164:23 - think I'm not sure what you guys are
164:25 - necessarily expecting I know I've been
164:26 - getting emails almost every day asking
164:27 - me to do a second
164:29 - course and um if I systematically went
164:32 - through every Advanced technique in FL
164:33 - Studio we'd probably be here for like
164:35 - about a year because there are so many
164:36 - different things that I could go through
164:38 - and all of them are important so I'm
164:40 - trying to give you guys the tools that
164:42 - will enable you like uh so instead of
164:44 - giving you fish I want to teach you how
164:46 - to fish obviously so I want to teach you
164:47 - the methods that I use to become a good
164:49 - Producer instead of just telling you
164:51 - facts or telling you stuff that is
164:54 - helpful but you're probably not going to
164:55 - remember because this is a long tutorial
164:57 - it's going to be like probably over an
164:58 - hour and so I want to give you a ways of
165:01 - becoming better that way you can become
165:03 - better artist on your own instead of uh
165:05 - watching tons of tutorials and then
165:07 - forgetting everything and that and still
165:08 - being the same level producer which
165:10 - definitely happens um so I don't want to
165:12 - trick you guys with tutorials I want to
165:15 - help you improve so one thing that could
165:18 - help you improve is by simply just going
165:20 - on your master sticking an Edison on
165:23 - there that's aor not fector it's a cool
165:26 - plugin but not what I was looking for
165:28 - Edison just going to hit record and I'm
165:31 - literally just going to go to vital and
165:32 - then as soon as you just start messing
165:34 - around you're recording in here so I can
165:38 - literally just find
165:42 - some like
165:51 - [Music]
166:14 - same
166:16 - so we got
166:17 - [Music]
166:23 - [Music]
166:30 - like so as you can see I like just was
166:33 - messing around for a second and then
166:36 - uh where am I I need this so you can
166:40 - take this right and I can actually drag
166:42 - and drop this immediately by clicking
166:44 - this button right here and into the
166:46 - [Music]
166:52 - playlist and I could take something like
166:57 - this right I could copy that I like
167:00 - that I could literally copy and make
167:02 - this use a unique sample save this it's
167:05 - going to go into uh my backup and then I
167:08 - can go to tww samples I go
167:11 - to where is it my samples render
167:15 - and then this is called September 13th
167:17 - Part One blah blah blah I could just
167:19 - call
167:20 - this du du du and then I could save it
167:24 - and then I could go back to our project
167:25 - file that we just
167:27 - in and then I could literally just pull
167:30 - let me show you guys an
167:36 - example because that that was what an
167:38 - AAR major and I just did that in C major
167:40 - so need to go one two steps down
167:45 - and then whole
167:47 - octop okay that so I have this right
167:50 - here I'll just literally go to my
167:53 - samples my
167:56 - samples just refresh it
167:59 - du okay so I just need to pitch it down
168:02 - twice go up
168:05 - once
168:09 - stretch maybe like stretch it so it fits
168:12 - in
168:13 - like
168:29 - I have no idea like
168:33 - just it doesn't really sound that good
168:35 - but uh just for instance you could see
168:37 - how this could be cool like where you
168:39 - just have a recording where you could
168:42 - just go in Edison sound design cut a
168:44 - small part of it and then use that in
168:45 - your tracks so you never really know
168:47 - what you'll get like just messing around
168:48 - and a lot of times you miss it like
168:49 - you're like oh that sound is so cool and
168:51 - then you like don't have it every time
168:52 - your sound design it just hit Edison and
168:53 - you'll literally never miss any of those
168:54 - moments and then what you can do is you
168:56 - can have a folder like this where you
168:57 - just save all of those recordings of
168:59 - your Edison sound design and then you'll
169:01 - have all of those as your own library of
169:04 - samples and I started doing this my
169:06 - computer unfortunately crashed so like I
169:08 - obviously I didn't make this Advanced
169:09 - tutorial for another eight months so the
169:13 - reason being for that was for a lot of
169:15 - reasons one my computer completely
169:16 - failed I lost everything and I like
169:18 - restart from scratch and then that was
169:19 - like really difficult um the second
169:22 - thing was more of a personal uh thing
169:25 - with a relationship so like I was I was
169:26 - like really down so I just was not in
169:27 - the mental state to like make another
169:29 - thing so I was tough and then so after I
169:31 - got I kind of refixed my computer got a
169:33 - new laptop got a new setup obviously
169:36 - well you can't see because I'm doing a
169:37 - green screen but I'm in a new place
169:38 - right now I got a new microphone I got
169:39 - new everything that took about like
169:41 - two-ish months then by that time I was
169:44 - thinking about doing doing personal
169:45 - courses uh for the people in the first
169:46 - beginner class but I decided not to
169:48 - because I just wasn't sure of how much
169:49 - value I could provide uh the big thing
169:52 - with that was that I was thinking okay
169:54 - well if I do personal courses for you
169:56 - guys how much value is that really
169:58 - giving to and I figured okay it's
169:59 - actually not providing that much value
170:00 - because I wouldn't want to give knowing
170:02 - what I know now I wouldn't have wanted
170:04 - somebody to I wouldn't have wanted to
170:07 - pay somebody to give me just one-on-one
170:08 - advice that wasn't I don't think that
170:10 - that would be as helpful uh what I do
170:13 - think would be helpful was teaching the
170:14 - and the reasons of why I do things for
170:16 - free uh and I think that's more helpful
170:17 - than me doing paid courses so that's why
170:19 - I never offered uh paid courses um that
170:22 - being said another reason I really
170:23 - couldn't do the course for so long was
170:25 - because uh I literally just couldn't
170:27 - like I needed to work I just didn't have
170:29 - time so the only reason I'm I'm doing
170:31 - this now is because I a I wanted to make
170:34 - a second installment because I get
170:35 - emails every single day and then I also
170:37 - I've always wanted to do music uh to
170:39 - some capacity as as like a career so I
170:41 - mean uh obviously I don't think I can do
170:43 - that for a while I would have to kind of
170:44 - establish myself a little bit more um
170:47 - but I am going to be releasing the FP
170:49 - for this completely free um and I
170:51 - believe yeah all the samples I used are
170:53 - are free so uh you can pick up all these
170:56 - samples for free as well and I'll just
170:57 - release this FP in the
170:59 - description and you could pick that up
171:02 - um if you'd also like I'm also going to
171:04 - leave uh under a comment I'm just going
171:06 - to have uh just my my YouTube channel
171:08 - and I'm also going to have uh like
171:10 - hopefully some type of website by time
171:12 - this course is out or some link uh to
171:14 - like a pack which you could use to to
171:16 - help me and also help your Productions
171:17 - as well just improve uh what you're
171:19 - making cuz I know it could be hard to
171:21 - find samples out there it can be hard uh
171:23 - so I'll probably have samples and
171:24 - presets I'm not exactly sure what I'm
171:25 - going to do for that by the time this
171:26 - course is out but I'll have something
171:28 - something available and then also
171:29 - something for free for you guys so if
171:31 - You' like to support me in that way
171:32 - hopefully I can make you guys more
171:33 - tutorials and I'd love to start making
171:34 - more tutorials on my channel as well um
171:38 - I don't know how much I have to add to
171:40 - this uh I was going to do this in
171:42 - collaboration with another artist and uh
171:44 - he was going to do vocals so what I
171:46 - might do is if this tutorial keeps going
171:49 - then that means that he's collaborating
171:50 - with me and if he's collaborating with
171:51 - me then maybe I could do a second part
171:53 - of this tutorial where we have the
171:55 - vocals on top and we try to finish the
171:56 - track together and in that case I'll get
171:58 - back to you guys and maybe I'll do a
172:00 - part two and maybe we'll just keep this
172:02 - as a shorter version of the tutorial and
172:04 - just see how it goes so with that being
172:06 - said thanks so much for your guys
172:07 - support I'm glad that these tutorials
172:09 - are helping and I know this is a little
172:10 - bit different format and maybe a little
172:12 - less of what you were expecting uh in
172:14 - terms of the last tutorial I did was a
172:17 - lot more methodical this didn't really
172:18 - have chapters it was more of just off
172:20 - the cuff like okay let's make this
172:21 - Challenge and then let's explain what I
172:22 - was doing uh so I hope you found value
172:24 - in this as well I know it's a bit
172:26 - different um but thanks for watching
172:28 - guys and uh I'll see you
172:29 - [Music]
172:32 - soon all right we're here in the actual
172:35 - project after the 1 hour challenge and
172:37 - now I'm going to show you guys what this
172:39 - looks like so to me I uh it was not
172:42 - loading some some of the things which is
172:43 - unfortunate but I'm going just going to
172:44 - play it the way it is and we'll try to
172:46 - go through as much as we can so a lot of
172:48 - this stuff looks exactly the same as my
172:50 - 1 hour challenge obviously I absolutely
172:51 - love what he did here it looks so
172:53 - awesome that he like uh color
172:54 - coordinated everything I love that um
172:57 - props I thank you blend a base uh so we
173:02 - got and I feel like I can skip a lot of
173:04 - this because it's just the same as
173:05 - winner challenge uh let's go to the to
173:07 - the part that he did stuff
173:12 - with obviously this is not sound very
173:14 - good I'm not sure why it's not loading
173:16 - some of the plugins right so it's not
173:17 - going to sound very nice
173:22 - but so you can see he actually chopped
173:24 - up uh both the samples here and just
173:26 - made some interesting uh rhythmic and
173:28 - Pitch patterns to change it up
173:35 - here the funny thing is when I first uh
173:37 - saw him doing this I'm like this is kind
173:38 - of hard to follow and then after now I'm
173:39 - like completely vibing with it and it's
173:41 - awesome and I was wrong again all uh
173:44 - then he did this super cool thing where
173:45 - he he sampled and then used the channel
173:48 - pitch or the sample to make this one of
173:50 - the coolest things I've I've heard I
173:52 - don't know this is so cool to
173:54 - me that is such a that that is that is
173:57 - swag that's like the way that that comes
173:59 - into this
174:01 - bar that is so cool as soon as I heard
174:03 - him do that I was like okay that's sick
174:05 - um but yeah it's just uh changing the
174:07 - pitch of and he used the song to sample
174:09 - itself and then yeah it's very very
174:11 - creative um right here we have a really
174:13 - cool uh chord
174:15 - [Music]
174:19 - preset and it's kind of playing with
174:21 - everything
174:22 - [Music]
174:28 - else I really wanted to use a drop and
174:30 - make something with this I just never
174:31 - got the the chance to since the project
174:33 - wasn't working in my favor unfortunately
174:35 - but uh let's go so he I like how he also
174:37 - moves down further and further uh so not
174:40 - everything's on the same level it's kind
174:41 - of interesting uh let's go here see what
174:43 - he did here
174:45 - in the front
174:47 - scene to the and
174:51 - you so we see the way that he did his
174:53 - voice was super interesting so he
174:55 - actually used his voice as a instrument
174:57 - uh and the instrument isn't loing for me
174:58 - but he actually used his voice and then
175:00 - uh he forgot I forgot the way that he
175:02 - explained it but it's so interesting he
175:03 - actually essentially used it as a sample
175:06 - and then uh played chords with it uh
175:08 - under his own voice this is
175:13 - very
175:15 - so you can hear that playing over and
175:16 - over again that's his voice and then he
175:18 - has
175:22 - going oh the chords are working so yeah
175:24 - this is his voice you can hear
175:27 - it it's like playing his AC C
175:30 - capella and that's him saying it always
175:32 - on the
175:33 - [Music]
175:38 - run Horizons behind me looking at the
175:43 - dashboard fast FL D so you can see that
175:47 - we keep the vocals mostly mono and we
175:49 - have different uh different vocal layers
175:50 - going to different vocal buses and then
175:52 - eqing those uh separately is the way
175:54 - that he did it which is the same way
175:55 - that I do my vocals as well uh and then
175:57 - you can just apply effects those
175:59 - different um side pan vocals and the
176:00 - ones that are in the center and
176:02 - obviously the ones that make up the
176:03 - chords so that you can have a a very
176:05 - cohesive vocal so it's not just a a
176:07 - vocal is almost never just one take it's
176:09 - usually like uh 10 different takes and
176:11 - then uh doing slightly different things
176:12 - with each one of those to complement the
176:13 - whole so that's usually the way that uh
176:15 - vocals are done so you should never
176:17 - expect to just like record vocals into a
176:18 - mic and then just be like good for your
176:19 - song like that almost never happens I
176:21 - usually tons of vocal samples and that's
176:23 - how that
176:30 - works I think I accidentally changed
176:32 - some of this a way I was like messing
176:33 - around earlier that's pretty
176:35 - funny this part is so cool I love how it
176:37 - like drops out into this giant opens up
176:39 - into this like rebb area where like it
176:41 - just uh kind of expands the song and
176:43 - then it there's no rhythmic element
176:45 - going on so it's just kind of floaty and
176:46 - then it turns into a buildup which I
176:47 - thought was one of the most creative
176:49 - ways to go from an like an ambient track
176:51 - from hipop and then into like a buildup
176:53 - it just shows like uh when you collab
176:55 - with people you're going to come up with
176:56 - ideas that are like greater than some of
176:58 - the parts because I know for a fact like
176:59 - when I sent him this track he doesn't
177:01 - make stuff like this so like the stuff
177:02 - that he's going to make out of it is
177:03 - going to be super interesting um and
177:06 - just be different so it's it's really
177:07 - it's really cool and fun to collab and
177:09 - that's another reason why you should
177:10 - join
177:13 - the
177:14 - [Music]
177:18 - and then he as you can hear that this
177:19 - riter is slowly getting
177:21 - [Music]
177:30 - louder in my opinion in my opinion this
177:32 - is is my opinion I think that that it
177:34 - probably should have hit here it just
177:35 - goes for a little bit extra and I think
177:36 - that lose a little bit of energy that's
177:37 - just my thoughts but overall still
177:39 - really
177:43 - dope
177:45 - still
177:48 - [Music]
178:00 - really and then he completely made this
178:02 - part this wasn't me at all he's just
178:03 - like I want to make this part I'm like
178:04 - all go for it and then he did it was it
178:06 - was super sick uh and I've never heard
178:08 - him make this type of house music before
178:09 - really interesting we usually make like
178:11 - future balance or something this is this
178:12 - is super cool uh but yeah and then
178:15 - obviously he has the lead playing in the
178:23 - background I'm trying to figure out
178:24 - where the lead is is it this no it's a
178:27 - high hat it must be this
178:29 - [Music]
178:42 - right I am not seeing the lead I might
178:44 - just be blind but anyways very cool um I
178:47 - don't have a ton to add as I said the
178:49 - project didn't totally load for me so
178:51 - it's a little bit unfortunate but um
178:54 - yeah this is this is the project uh if
178:55 - you were curious and seeing a little bit
178:56 - like what it looks like this is what it
178:58 - ended up turning out like um this was
179:00 - going to be actually the whole uh
179:01 - Advanced tutorial I was going to go over
179:03 - this entire track uh after the 1 hour
179:05 - challenge so I just wanted to do a
179:07 - shorter version of that since this is
179:08 - already getting pretty long with the
179:09 - other uh version of the course that I
179:11 - did and I have recorded many versions of
179:14 - this course but hopefully you liked this
179:15 - version and without further Ado I hope
179:18 - that you are able to create your own
179:20 - songs out of this and that this was
179:22 - helpful uh into improving your
179:23 - Productions in the future so without
179:25 - further Ado I'll see you later and you
179:27 - can uh see if you want to see more of me
179:29 - I'm going to be making YouTube videos
179:30 - I'll see you there
179:31 - [Music]
179:34 - bye one of the last things I wanted to
179:36 - go over was one of the most Advanced
179:38 - Techniques I think uh that I can teach
179:40 - you and it's so something so funny
179:42 - because a lot of people learned this
179:43 - really early and some people don't learn
179:44 - it for a very long time for some reason
179:46 - uh and it's not really that complicated
179:48 - and some people might laugh and be like
179:49 - oh it's so simple like either why didn't
179:51 - I think of that before or why are you
179:53 - just telling them this now like this is
179:54 - not like an advanced tip but it will
179:55 - help you become an advanced producer and
179:57 - that's simply using reference tracks uh
180:00 - this is so important so I used uh I I
180:03 - can't play this song because it'll get
180:04 - copyrighted but I used this as uh there
180:07 - was an advertising agency that wanted me
180:08 - to make a song similar to this so I uh
180:10 - took the song and I re pretty much
180:13 - remade it and just change the Melodies
180:14 - and instruments to make my own version
180:16 - of it with kind of the same energy uh so
180:18 - this was the initial track uh I was able
180:20 - to use an AI to split the vocals from
180:22 - the instrumental and then I had the
180:23 - instrumental in my track and tried to
180:25 - make something really similar so you
180:26 - guys can listen to this song on your own
180:28 - time and then come back here and listen
180:29 - to what this sounds
180:32 - like in comparison to the original
180:42 - track
180:44 - [Music]
181:12 - e
181:16 - [Music]
181:19 - the funny thing about this is I also
181:20 - made this in like an hour like an hour
181:22 - and a half and I had to make it really
181:24 - quickly because of deadlines and so
181:26 - deadlines are could be a huge motivator
181:27 - for making things really quickly and uh
181:30 - this is just one example of how I had a
181:31 - reference track and how I was able to
181:33 - use that to try to copy and make
181:35 - something similar to that and then do my
181:36 - own take on it so I use the arrangement
181:39 - as inspiration I use the type of
181:40 - instruments they were using as
181:41 - inspiration and ultimately it can help
181:43 - you uh expand your music production what
181:46 - is it like repertoire because uh by
181:47 - trying to figure out how other artists
181:49 - did things it will help you realize
181:51 - things that you've never tried before
181:52 - and uh open you up to new ways of making
181:54 - things so for instance something like
181:55 - this guitar section I had never made
181:56 - anything like this before and I thought
181:57 - it sounded really
181:59 - [Music]
182:03 - interesting like I do not make guitar
182:05 - patterns usually like this so this was
182:06 - the
182:08 - [Music]
182:12 - inspiration
182:15 - so I just thought it turned out pretty
182:16 - interesting so uh and it really fit the
182:18 - track so stuff like that and then I
182:20 - never used to make guitar Melodies that
182:21 - kind of would like this all of it was
182:22 - really interesting and a learning
182:23 - experience for me and while I don't
182:25 - really make this type of music and I'm
182:26 - not super like impressed by like the
182:28 - final result I'm like it's all right
182:29 - it's like not something I release or
182:30 - work on really any longer um but I know
182:34 - that it's something that that um that
182:35 - they were looking for so this is
182:36 - something that they wanted not something
182:38 - that I wanted so I was uh making it for
182:40 - a different reason there but uh yeah use
182:42 - reference tracks and try to make make it
182:43 - as close to as you can uh and just kind
182:45 - of it'll help you fix uh learn how to
182:47 - make your mixes better because you'll be
182:48 - listening to professionals and their
182:50 - mixes and how to make your instrumentals
182:52 - and so that's uh one huge tip is just
182:53 - using reference tracks and then
182:55 - following and using their Arrangement as
182:56 - a uh inspiration for your own
182:58 - arrangement for your track uh and that
183:00 - can help you and save you so much time
183:01 - because if you don't know how to arrange
183:02 - your music because you're not listening
183:04 - to music that other people are listening
183:05 - to then your music is going to be
183:07 - chaotic and it's be hard to follow and
183:09 - yeah it'll just be difficult and you
183:10 - might think oh I don't want like any
183:12 - limitations I don't want anything to
183:14 - stunt my creativity it's like your
183:16 - creativity only works if you have
183:17 - limitations first to break you can't go
183:19 - outside of a box if there is no box so
183:21 - that's why reference tracks are so
183:22 - helpful because they give you something
183:24 - that you can work off of and be creative
183:25 - with so hopefully that that was helpful
183:27 - and I just wanted to quickly show this
183:29 - um and I don't know how much more I have
183:31 - to show you guys uh I really thought I
183:33 - went over a lot for this Advanced
183:35 - tutorial and I know it's not as
183:36 - comprehensive and maybe some people
183:37 - wanted um so maybe I just go a kind of
183:40 - speed through all the tips before we go
183:43 - out basically every tip that comes to my
183:45 - mind I'm this is going to be like a
183:46 - supercharged tip section where I just
183:47 - zoom through a million tips that I can
183:49 - think of uh and then we'll close it out
183:52 - the last thing that I'd like to say is
183:53 - that I do have a website with my sing
183:55 - pack and I think that this would be
183:56 - super helpful for you guys and the
183:58 - reason that uh I'm even offering the SLE
184:00 - pack and I think that would be useful
184:01 - for to you guys is because I am updating
184:03 - it um every time I make some new music
184:05 - or I make uh something I'm adding uh
184:07 - different things that I've made to that
184:09 - sample pack for free so as you buy it
184:11 - you can always go back and download the
184:12 - new samples I add so so there's almost
184:14 - no sample packs that do that where you
184:15 - just buy it and there's always new
184:16 - samples for you every time you open it
184:17 - up that's super cool I think so uh I
184:19 - just want to let you guys know that's
184:21 - Tristan wil cox. us with twls and then I
184:24 - also off all my patreon I offer personal
184:26 - courses uh one-on-one and I give you
184:28 - feedback at different uh tiers you can
184:30 - see that whatever works for you to help
184:32 - support uh support me and then I also
184:34 - make YouTube videos for free so uh you
184:36 - guys can see my Productions on my own
184:37 - music and hopefully I can share uh some
184:39 - knowledge and just help you guys grow in
184:41 - your music producer Journey so without
184:42 - further ado we are going to zoom through
184:45 - all the tips starting now so one thing
184:48 - that you can do is if you have sample
184:50 - packs I would go through all your
184:51 - samples and make one Consolidated uh
184:54 - sample pack with all your favorite
184:55 - samples out of different sample packs
184:57 - you use rather than having hundreds of
184:59 - sample packs in your browser so that's
185:00 - something that I did and this is what I
185:02 - came up with I had drums extra sample
185:04 - packs effects uh yeah so this got kind
185:07 - of messy pretty quickly but essentially
185:09 - you'll have all the folders full of
185:12 - things that you have so I have drum and
185:13 - this says buildup Loop claps fills drum
185:15 - loops and then you can see that these
185:16 - come from all sorts of different sample
185:17 - packs I've downloaded in the past and
185:19 - samples that I've made and so what this
185:21 - does is effectively consolidates all
185:23 - your sample packs uh into one sample
185:25 - pack rather than having to go through a
185:26 - million sample packs to find the ones
185:27 - that you want uh so this is I think very
185:30 - helpful um another thing that you can do
185:32 - is just save literally everything save
185:35 - your projects save your fops export your
185:36 - fops name your FPS and your exported of
185:39 - the FP the same thing so that if I
185:41 - search for the FP I can find the
185:42 - exported file in case that FP gets
185:45 - corrupted save your work see where
185:47 - you've been I have not saved a lot of my
185:48 - work and that's why I lost a lot of my
185:50 - work so just something that I want to
185:52 - know uh so you always want to be saving
185:54 - your stuff always want to be making
185:55 - backups of your stuff uh something that
185:57 - you can do is if you have any preset you
185:59 - can save your presets go here go file go
186:02 - save as preset and then save that and
186:04 - then once you save that name it the same
186:06 - thing uh so whatever I name it here name
186:08 - that the same thing that you save it's
186:09 - it's a mixer chain as well so whatever
186:11 - the mixer chain is called you want to
186:13 - save those as the same name so when you
186:14 - open up both you can up both of those
186:16 - together uh something cool that you can
186:18 - always mess around with is that if
186:19 - you're in the piano roll you can always
186:20 - go to this down arrow key go to view go
186:23 - to scale highlighting and you can put it
186:24 - on automatic and it will help you
186:26 - highlight different uh parts of the
186:27 - scale that you're looking for or you can
186:29 - change it to the scale of the reference
186:31 - track that you're working on or you can
186:33 - just make it some interesting scale and
186:34 - just mess around with that and see what
186:36 - kind of uh creative ideas and Melodies
186:38 - that helps you come up with something I
186:40 - would really recommend uh is that when
186:42 - you you are uh editing your notes you
186:45 - want allow resizing from left to be
186:47 - enabled this is super annoying when it's
186:48 - off so I highly recommend that you have
186:50 - that enabled if you want uh a window on
186:53 - one of your syns to be open make sure
186:55 - that you on this arrow you click
186:57 - detached and it will stay open as you're
186:58 - working uh and that's really helpful for
187:00 - like if I want to be sound designing
187:02 - this and changing notes I can't do both
187:03 - at the same time unless this window is
187:05 - detached okay so that just means that
187:08 - this changing things here doesn't affect
187:10 - this window uh and then if I want to un
187:13 - attach this you'll see what happens if I
187:14 - change something here it'll disappear
187:16 - that window so that you can fully Focus
187:18 - so that's just another thing if you are
187:20 - afraid of making a change in your track
187:22 - and you don't want it to affect uh your
187:24 - overall production you can go to file
187:25 - you can go to save as new version and
187:28 - what that will do is it will essentially
187:30 - make the a copy of that flp as a new
187:33 - version so you can make any changes that
187:34 - you want and still have your old version
187:35 - of the flp without changing anything
187:37 - there um something that you can do is
187:40 - that if uh you have some there's this
187:42 - weird automation glitch that happens uh
187:44 - but sometimes you need uh you'll have a
187:46 - mixer track uh that looks like this
187:48 - where um it just no matter what you do
187:50 - it's always stuck at zero what you want
187:52 - to do to fix this is turn this mixture
187:54 - track all the way up right click it and
187:56 - then go initiate song with this position
187:58 - once you do that it will reset that one
188:00 - uh if it's still not working uh you can
188:02 - always reset the entire uh preset by or
188:05 - reset the entire mixer Chain by clicking
188:06 - reset select trct the
188:08 - default if you want to save and copy
188:11 - effects from one mixture chain to
188:12 - another what you can do is you can right
188:13 - click and you can go to file and you go
188:16 - to save mixure track St as if you click
188:18 - and hold and drag you can drag that to
188:21 - any other mixer chain and unlet go on
188:23 - that and will copy everything about that
188:25 - to the new mixer chain that is so cool
188:28 - to me that you can do that um another
188:30 - thing that you can do is that if you'd
188:32 - like to make a slightly different um uh
188:36 - lead like variant is that like let's say
188:38 - I have a first drop and then I have a
188:39 - second drop and I want to make a
188:40 - different lead but it still fits in my
188:41 - track I can actually just right click on
188:43 - this and click clone and it will
188:45 - duplicate uh that preset and then I can
188:47 - make slight differences in that preset
188:48 - so that I have two different uh things
188:50 - that are but both similar in style if
188:53 - that makes sense so hopefully that
188:54 - wasn't too complicated um what's another
188:57 - thing uh let's think I'm running out
189:00 - steam I I was like I was on a roll with
189:02 - with with those tips let's see if I can
189:03 - uh think of anymore um if you have uh
189:06 - this uh magnet on on different things it
189:09 - can really screw you up so I have mine
189:11 - on cell and that's what it's selected on
189:13 - so when I move things around it always
189:14 - clicks to the nearest cell if I had this
189:16 - on none it would just slide kind of all
189:19 - around and be very unpredictable so I
189:21 - have it on cell that way when I click it
189:23 - um it properly uh aligns to the grid the
189:26 - way you would imagine it would um
189:28 - something that you can do is that if I
189:30 - left click and hold alt I
189:32 - can I can uh I can uh play patterns in
189:35 - the
189:37 - [Music]
189:39 - track and then you can also do this on a
189:42 - different level inside inside the piano
189:46 - roll without playing through the entire
189:48 - thing so if you just want to hear what
189:49 - this chord sounds like at the end
189:50 - without having to play the hold pattern
189:51 - over again alt right
189:54 - click and you can drag through to see
189:56 - what that sounds like um one thing uh
189:58 - another tip that I have which I shared
189:59 - in the very beginning of the course is
190:01 - any knob that you see in a third party
190:03 - Plugin or in a normal plugin you can
190:05 - click and you can automate if you go
190:07 - here and I Chang something I can go to
190:08 - what I changed up here right click it
190:10 - and go create automation clip and it
190:11 - will literally create an automation clip
190:12 - for whatever I just moved last um as you
190:15 - can see that create an automation clip
190:16 - for that five band frequency and that's
190:18 - how you can make automations for
190:19 - literally anything that you change in
190:20 - the entire uh in the entire uh
190:24 - program um other things that I can
190:27 - recommend uh in the sampler uh if you
190:30 - want to uh play like an instrument uh
190:34 - you can't just do it by dragging and
190:36 - dropping the sample in here what you'd
190:38 - actually have to do is go to your
190:39 - channel Rack open up something called
190:41 - the sampler here
190:43 - and once you open up that sampler and
190:45 - drag and drop a sample onto that let's
190:48 - say actually I need actually like a one
190:51 - shot and then I need to be like a synth
190:54 - and then I'll drop that sampler into the
190:59 - sample and that will give you the
191:01 - envelope tool which you can use to to
191:03 - change the envelope of your
191:11 - sound
191:14 - and then I use the cross bait and this
191:15 - will allow you to sustain whatever
191:17 - instrument that you're playing over time
191:18 - so if I put the cross bait all the way
191:21 - up you can hear it's like still playing
191:23 - a little bit which is really cool um
191:25 - another thing that you can do is that if
191:26 - you want it to slide you can go to this
191:27 - wrench tool click mono click up and then
191:30 - uh Max and then you can do one is what I
191:32 - like to
191:35 - do and then you can have it uh bending
191:37 - like crazy like I showed you in the
191:38 - beginning of the sound design course so
191:39 - that's how you do that in the sampler um
191:41 - something that you can do is if this
191:42 - range for pitch isn't enough you can
191:44 - just increase the range to 12 uh that'll
191:46 - make it go up octave up or an octave
191:47 - down and then you can automate the pitch
191:50 - of that accordingly because you cannot
191:51 - as far as I know automate this pitch
191:53 - right here so that's just a quick tip
191:55 - right there also did you know that the
191:57 - volume here and the volume in here in
191:59 - the channel rack are exactly the same so
192:01 - you can see this thing changing with
192:02 - this those are the same thing
192:04 - FYI um trying to think of anything else
192:07 - that I can think of if you take hold on
192:08 - the sample you can also drag and then
192:09 - drop it in the in the uh playlist as as
192:12 - well so those are kind of they work
192:14 - together as well in that way um if I
192:18 - have a pattern that has multiple things
192:20 - going on in it I can split it so like
192:22 - let's say I have this chord progression
192:26 - and it is in this melody here and I go
192:29 - like here and I paste those chords and I
192:31 - have these kind of on top of each other
192:32 - I can go to this pattern I can right
192:34 - click the pattern and click split by
192:35 - Channel and then will pull out that and
192:38 - then give me the guitar and that chord
192:40 - separately in two different patterns so
192:42 - you can use that for arranging um and
192:44 - doing that um another cool thing that
192:45 - you can do is in the top left corner of
192:47 - this it gives you tons of settings for
192:48 - the sampler uh for samples and for uh
192:51 - your uh patterns so for instance I can
192:53 - click chop and I can go uh different
192:55 - things so I can do like beat Shuffle and
192:56 - it will like completely change the way
192:58 - this
192:58 - [Music]
193:06 - go and that completely changed the
193:07 - melody because it chopped it up and the
193:09 - same thing happens uh with loot base
193:11 - samples too so if I go to Loop
193:13 - and I go to like actually let me just
193:15 - show you guys an example by literally
193:17 - muting everything except for this and
193:20 - then going to my own sample pack and
193:22 - this will just be a little plug because
193:24 - I'll show you one of the cooler samples
193:26 - in my pack so we'll go to loops and go
193:28 - to
193:31 - other you can't tell me this doesn't
193:33 - sound
193:34 - [Music]
193:41 - sick
193:44 - it's so funny like I like I make stuff
193:46 - like this and then like you guys see me
193:48 - like when I'm working and trying to show
193:49 - you guys how to music produce and I like
193:50 - make like the most garbage stuff but
193:52 - then like when I'm alone like sitting
193:53 - it's like raining outside I'm like
193:54 - making like music like this is so funny
193:56 - it just depends on like the mood I'm in
193:58 - and like different things to be it can
193:59 - highly affect the way also how much
194:01 - water you drink and what snacks you have
194:03 - with you will affect different types of
194:04 - music that you're making cool facts okay
194:07 - so uh top left corner here I can go to
194:09 - here and there's all sorts uh types of
194:11 - settings like if I want to make another
194:13 - sample that's um high pitched and the
194:15 - other one low pitched but I want them to
194:16 - play at the same time I could go to
194:18 - click this make unique a sample and this
194:21 - uh will not affect what I changed here
194:22 - will not affect this so I can have a
194:24 - play at the same
194:25 - [Music]
194:31 - time and then I could select both of
194:32 - them at the same time and I could
194:34 - actually make changes to both of them
194:35 - simultaneously so then I could uh have
194:38 - um CH I could chop it both the same way
194:40 - and then I could like do something like
194:41 - this
194:42 - [Laughter]
194:47 - [Music]
194:57 - and that for some reason sounds very
194:58 - cool so I might use that in some type of
195:00 - track on day but uh yeah you could use
195:02 - that that chop function and that was
195:04 - just one of the functions here there's
195:05 - so many different ones that you can do
195:06 - and I haven't even messed with all of
195:07 - them so apparently you can extract stems
195:09 - from the sample uh I haven't even tried
195:11 - this yet uh it's with the new FL
195:12 - studio21 update they just did I forgot
195:15 - which one but if you up I can extract
195:17 - stems uh this feature needs to be
195:19 - downloaded before it can be used
195:20 - download now sure let's do
195:22 - that that's so cool I've never used this
195:25 - before so like it's just exciting like
195:27 - you're just messing around you're just
195:28 - looking at different things and you can
195:29 - find all sorts of new stuff in Apple
195:31 - Studio Poss things new that they're
195:33 - adding so just going to download this
195:35 - really quick and see what it does so
195:36 - this is just the advanced production
195:38 - process just randomly seeing what
195:40 - happens when you click things uh and and
195:42 - then not being afraid to see what
195:44 - happens so let's do uh there's no vocals
195:47 - I can just pull that out and let's
195:48 - extract let's see what it does I'm
195:50 - really
195:53 - curious processing
195:58 - processing I'm so curious if this going
196:00 - to get all my samples out of this that
196:01 - would blow me
196:05 - away so does it just poop him out oh my
196:08 - goodness it does how cool is
196:11 - that
196:12 - [Music]
196:14 - and this is a
196:17 - base that is so you can't tell me that's
196:20 - not cool that is really cool like they
196:22 - just added this too okay that's another
196:24 - Advanced production technique extracting
196:26 - your s your own from things from samples
196:28 - how cool is that wow that is really cool
196:30 - I honestly I don't even think that I
196:31 - could show you a cool a cooler thing
196:33 - let's end it off like that I know e just
196:34 - added that I saw that and I hadn't used
196:36 - it until then that is so cool okay I
196:38 - think that's a great place to end it
196:40 - I've gone over a lot of stuff and I
196:41 - haven't even gone over over maybe like
196:43 - 5% of everything in this program it's
196:44 - insane like if I was literally to do an
196:46 - advanced tutorial front to back all
196:48 - everything I could be here for like a
196:51 - year like it's there's so much to do oh
196:54 - it's so frustrating like I just want to
196:55 - show you guys everything I want to I
196:56 - want to help you guys and I know that I
196:58 - can't do it all in one tutorial and
196:59 - that's why I want to for the last time
197:01 - say I making videos on my YouTube
197:03 - channel now uh because a lot of people
197:05 - have been asking me to and I'm going to
197:06 - help you guys we're going to do
197:07 - challenges I'm going to do like uh so
197:09 - we'll all kinds of really neat
197:11 - challenges uh in my Discord Community as
197:13 - well that um I'm hoping will add more
197:15 - fun and so you can find people to make
197:17 - music with so if you don't have any
197:18 - friends to make music with uh come join
197:20 - my Discord uh community and we're all
197:22 - going to make music together I'm going
197:23 - to do challenges I'll be there too it's
197:24 - not going to be one of those things
197:25 - where I just won't be there I will be
197:26 - there and I'll help you and if you're if
197:28 - you want to join me uh making music then
197:31 - just yeah join the channel join the
197:33 - stuff and I just want to thank uh free
197:35 - Cod camp for this opportunity again and
197:37 - I absolutely love their Channel and they
197:38 - helped me so much when I was in college
197:40 - as well so I want to return the favor by
197:41 - helping them uh by making a a tutorial
197:44 - that could help everyone else so with
197:45 - that being said thank you so much for

Cleaned transcript:

learn advanced music production with FL Studio in this course from Tristan Wilcox Tristan is a professional music producer with over 10,000 hours in music production in this course you'll learn complex techniques that will transform your approach to cing music Tristan covers everything from mastering plugins and sound design to understanding the subtle differences between being a music artist and a music producer in my first FL Studio beginner tutorial I taught you guys how to make your very first beginner track and I didn't assume that you knew anything I basically did the tutorial as if you had never heard of anything music production related and that you've never seen the software before in this tutorial I'm going to be assuming that you have made your own songs before you have been using FL Studio and if you're coming here for the first time and you do want to learn music production but you don't know anything about it yet I would highly suggest that you go watch some uh good beginnner tutorials and I have made a very indepth one that is also on this channel so if you watch that one first You' be uh greatly prepped for uh this one once you want a more advanced indepth look with this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is it's going to go a little bit differently um and rather than make a track uh because tracks that are in my estimation like Advanced I put in 40 to 50 hours into any given track and obviously that would be just a little bit too long for a full length YouTube production and while I hope I could record that one day I think the editing would be extremely tedious so uh for now what I'm going to do is I'm actually just going to go over some categories of Advanced Techniques that I think I could cover in a more realistic time frame so you guys can still get the benefits of having an advanced knowledge of music production without uh the price tag of having to watch something that would actually take that that length um something to know and this is going to be the very first thing so even if you don't watch the rest of this tutorial you at least get one of probably the most valuable tip you'll get um or you know what I'll give you two you're lucky today um the first one is that uh you have to love the process of music production if you don't like it you're never going to be a a truly Advanced producer or an artist in my estimation um my definition of an artist um I don't know what the actual definition is I should probably look it up but the one that I have written down here is that an artist is someone who can take a story idea or emotion and express it through sound um and I know it sounds extremely basic but the idea is that I have some idea or some pattern in my mind and I can like I have it there and I want to get it from here to onto the screen like that's that's what I want to do or I guess into the headphones not on the screen but you get the point and the software is just helping me accomplish that task so that is what I think an artist is a music producer the difference between music producer and artist a music producer just knows how to use the software okay and that's not anything too remarkable like anybody can learn anything with enough time and effort making music is a completely different thing and I think that that's why I'm really happy the first beginner tutorial I decided to teach you guys how to make music because that's different than learning music production you see what I'm saying so that's one tip is that if you don't know the differences between music production and actually being a music artist you might be trying to develop the wrong things uh so for for instance like if you just think oh I just need to learn more of about music production and then I'll be a better artist I mean you could be sending yourself on an infinite Journey that you'll never finish because being a better artist is a completely different skill set than being a music producer um it's about what the what can make you better at getting the ideas from your head on into the program rather than learning more about the program so yeah that's that's one thing the second thing and it does have to do with uh loving the process is that you want to constantly be asking yourself questions in life the like the what is it called um just adding things you're like oh this would sound cool if I did it like this or what if I use this like this or what if I use this in a way that's not supposed to be used or just you're trying new things you're trying to like uh you're always constant basically you're having fun that's that's basically what I'm trying to say you're having fun while making music if you're not having fun while you're making music then if it's not enjoyable I it's going to be really hard to make something good out of it and if even if you do make something that's a good production it may not really have an emotional connection with the listeners so those are two things that I think that already will help you just speed up the process of you becoming Advanced producer because if you spend time working developing skills that you don't need obviously that's going to waste your time so you want to be focused on exactly what you want if you want to just do music production you don't care too much about making your own music then sure learn the software as much as you possibly can but if you're looking to become an artist that's more the people I'm talking to because that's the Practical use for why you'd want to learn to make music in the first place so with that being said uh let's get into some more um advanced music production techniques that can help you as an artist so uh first things first I'm just going to show you guys um something pretty cool if I open up basically any plugin here um and by the way I'm using all free plugins so you guys can completely follow along with me if I just open up fidal for instance this is a great synthesizer if you guys are familiar with serum this is a very similar synth and it's completely free and I think it's I think it's amazing so if I just click on the plugin here and then just contr L this is a I'd say this is an intermediate technique but uh if you click control L it automatically puts it on the mixer as you can see it names it for you and it colors it and puts it on the nearest mixer that isn't already taken so and obviously the reason of why this is useful is is immediately evident if you've ever used F studio for organizing because what happens is you're like okay well I have to go here and then I have to go to my channel rack and I have to put it on a mixer and then once I get it on that mixer I have to rename the mixer and you have to do all this stuff but just doing control L it does it all for you so I mean obviously that's going to be faster a lot more efficient so right there that's just going to help you keep track of where your instruments are and where they are in your mix so just an organizational tip right there um the second thing is is that um and this is just uh for all those people who wanted a sound design course you're welcome I'm going to go over the basics of sound design uh because I didn't do that in my beginner course and I think that a lot of you were interested in that so uh let's focus on the basic principles that will underly basically all music production uh sound design your attack delay sustain and release okay now attack uh basically this is think of this as a volume over time okay so what does that mean well for example why don't we just play the note and see what happens you can see that we can follow this line and see what's going on so the it's almost like a graph so the higher on the graph the more volume the lower on the graph the less volume further to the left is closest to us in time and then further to the right would be in the future so you can see what what's happening over time to the the volume of the sound so what attack is going to do you can almost visualize it in your head but also explain it can help uh you can see that it's going to start off lower volume go up in high volume and then come back down okay so that's what attack does Decay you can see how it affects the tail of the sound you can see the sustain is going to you might be like what what does this do let's see okay so if you hold the note the sustain actually will hold it at this volume it will never go lower than the than the what whatever this is saying is at it'll hold it at that volume until you let go of the note when you let go of the note the tail at the end this little release that's what happens after I let go of the note the rest of it that plays is your release so what this is typically called is your adsr attack Decay sustain and release and sometimes you have some extra ones like hold hold is an extra one that's not on all synthesizers but it is on some and then delay which is uh your more fancy synthesizers will have this not all of them do um and obviously you can see kind of based off of what it did to the visual you can tell what it would do like soundwise but if you can just know this you can make all kinds of sounds so first of all I can make pluck or I guess chords uh if I want to move the attack down I can make more pluck if I wanted more of a chord I could add a little bit of attack and then maybe a little bit more Decay if I wanted to add a more Super thing you could have it have high sustain so so there's lots of options here um and depending on which genre you're making it's going to affect the adsr of the sounds that you're actually using so for instance synth wave they have like very long release a very long Su or very high sustain and kind of hard attack so it's like a very lengthy drawn out stuff also I don't know music theory so don't judge my piano playing skills um so basically that's that's the fundamental that's the most fundamental sound production I can give you the second part is we have our uh oscillator so oscillator is going to be What wave table it's playing over and over and over again so um if you click the 2D and 3D you can see the different views of the oscillator so I have this let's go to a different one so I can show you guys really what's going on here so that's the 3D view I mean that's the 2D this is the 3D view it's scrolling through the through the thing and then this is the uh side view it's pretty cool it it kind of shows you what is happening to the wave table as you scroll through it and just scrolling through it I just left click and drag up down or you can drag this not so uh let's just do some basic sound design things so this let's make a more of a synth wav is excuse me let's make more of a synth wav is uh type thing so let's use this wave table because it looks pretty cool and I'm going to start here I'm going to drag this envelope you see this is envelope one the one that we're working on if I go to a different tab it's going to change so it's like envelope one drag it onto this uh the thing that was changing the wave tape okay so now what happens it's pretty interesting so it's actually taking the input of this and applying it to this um what's it called this um knob so you can do this All and by changing this knob right here it changes the way you can see how I'm using the the attack uh okay hold on let me say this correctly the envelope of this is sh is working on this knob in the exact same pattern okay and it's basically changing the the wave table so it's it's one of those things that like more of like after you do things a lot you kind of know what they do and what you're trying to accomplish but it's harder to explain like in words what's going on and honestly I think that the wordy definitions aren't the most useful things in mustion anyways it's just like hey here's this technique you can use this and learn it so uh without overe explaining everything uh another thing you can do is if you turn this knob the opposite direction and this works in a lot of these type of plugins uh is it'll actually go the opposite way so okay so we have some cool there I'm going to turn up the Unison so what this is going to do is it's going to play the same uh the same wave table multiple times at different uh slightly different painting and slightly different uh pitches and by dragging down the dtune it's dragging down the panning and the uh the tuning of the separate wave tables to be closer together uh less detuned and less further right and left so we have something like that so right off the bat we just have one one uh what is it called wave table playing with just a little just one envelope okay now you could see how you get so complicated with music production because you could add another uh another wave table here you could add another oscillator playing a different wave table and that could have its own envelope so I could have this have a completely different envelope put that on maybe the the volume you can see just by using different envelopes and different things you can come up with completely uh really interesting uh like sounds just by adding multiple oscillators and multiple uh envelopes and you don't need to get that complicated uh you can make really good sounds just with one just like I was showing you before so even just with this uh we're just in the oscillator section right here of vital and there's lots of things you can work with this there's filters and these filters you can also automate with the envelope so like basically just think of this you can drag this envelope anywhere you can drag a lot of these knobs like all over the place and just be automating and changing everything over time and do some crazy stuff and you might be extremely overwhelmed but the fun part is it's all just experimenting and seeing what stuff does and what sounds good and then over time just by messing around and having that Spirit of I want to see what this does and it might break my project over and over again you'll start to very slowly see the connections between different plugins and see the see the patterns in them so I don't think it's really helpful for me to go through every what every single thing in this plugin does but rather give you the principles that allow you to go through many different plugins and understand the basics of each of them so the first uh principle that we went over was attack Decay sustain and release uh the second that we went through was the idea of wave tables that change over time um obviously our basic Unison and uh Dune and then we have pitch which is pretty selfexplanatory he's just going to change the p uh pitch up a note and then this is like the fine tuning of pitch and then uh our level which is just going to be the amplitude of the of the signal uh I showed you that we can add in different uh oscillators and wave tables that you can even apply filters before it goes to the effects and last but not least I guess I'll show you the voices over here so in the bottom right hand corner uh as you can see you can change the amount of voices that are playing so if I or I mean that are allowed to play so if I just play one and I try playing another note it's going to switch to that note and it won't let me play chords anymore because the max amount of voices I'm allowing is one which means that it's going to be just a lead instrument you might say Tristan why would you want to do this well suppose I want to have my notes slide between each other I could turn up the Glide and I could turn up the slope a little bit just to affect the way it Glides I can maybe hit Legato and now when I have just my one note and I play them uh play another note I could have a completely different style of sound just because I'm limiting it to one voice so it has to slide between the notes uh like and that's just an interesting thing that you could do and maybe you want to turn this off and then you don't want to Glide and you want to turn up the voices I have chords so just different ways of working so or it depends on what you want um macros uh this is important so a macro you can control a bunch of different things and then have it all one knob controlling all of this so this knob doesn't do anything on its own but it allows you to control many effects at the same time so let's say if I want to change uh a bunch like if I have one type of sound but then if I turn this macro up it affects a bunch of these knobs you could create a second version of that sound just uh based of How High this is up or down um next Advanced thing that you you can know is you any knob that you turn in almost any plugin in FL Studio even third party plugins can be automated so if I turn this macro up and down and then go to this knob up here and click right click you'll see that it says create automation clip if I just click that it'll create an automation clip and then literally if I just drag this up and down and we go back and we play this over and over and then go back to vital you'll see it's it's actually moving the macro in my uh plugin based off of this Automation and I and it works in real time I hold on I need to put this to attached so I can show you guys so that is like just so cool it it works so fast and you like can do things on the fly like as it's happening it's so helpful to do this kind of stuff so uh and automations are huge so you think that um maybe you don't want something to be changed within the plugin itself you can actually change it through automations out here and that could essentially act as yeah like a separate controller for it uh outside of your uh VST and that that could be super helpful so like if you're making a song and I want the volume of the instrument to be low on maybe the sine wave here I have it really low in the beginning of the song but as the song progresses I have this turning up over time just some things to think about just some ideas I can give you um so this is only the first section of the plugin and I didn't even go through all of it I didn't go through lfos lfos are pretty cool I guess I'll show you those really fast so this is affecting the volume but it Loops over and over again so if I turn the frequency up you can see kind of what's happening it's basically going through the playing it's like an envelope right here like the same adsr thing but then imagine that it restarts and plays it again after it gets to the end and then we can change the different uh Mo uh excuse me change the different modes so if I go to like sync oh maybe it's not sink hold on uh oh my bad I'm being silly it's um it would be SI you could do some clever things like that where uh it the way that it Loops is differently so sometimes you can Loop it based off of the the grid that you have in FL Studio so it will Loop like uh one beat uh one step like and then like you know just I don't know what the names are for it but then this would go based off a time so it could actually be offbeat with the song so many cool things you could do here um if you ever want to take something off though uh all you have to do is right click and click disconnect from lfl1 or you can go to the lfl that is connected to it and you disconnect from oscillator one and it will give you a list of all things that things are connected to so you can like disconnect things from where they're connected to um and this is also a bunch these are also really cool this has to do with like how you're playing like on your piano uh this will affect like the the the notes and Stu there's so many cool things in this PL I I could spend so time on all this stuff but we're just I want to keep moving too because there's just so much to cover okay uh effects so with effects uh this is basically think of this you have your your wave table uh your oscillator playing a wave table it's uh going through the envelope it might be going through a few filters that signal is going to move on and go to this next section called effects and then whatever you do in here is applied after this section right here so these go like in succession so now you have I can add chorus and it will'll apply to that sound we had from before oh my bad the level's off that's why because we had the LFO and it was controlling the volume so I have to turn this back up um just for sake of uh you guys not listen my piano playing uh let's uh put in a midi a midi from one of my midi packs so just that you guys have something to listen to that's not completely terrible let's play something that's a little bit more drawn out okay this is cool so we'll play this we'll turn the attack down just slightly and then we'll start uh just you know like making some cool idea so what we'll do is I'll add maybe just a tad bit Distortion just a little bit and this will just add just a little crispiness not that much just ever so slightly I just want it to sound like it's kind of like beaten up a little bit and then we'll add a little post to that Distortion and what that'll do is it'll just cut any he so got some really like epic synth wave action going on so we have uh let me just go through each one of these so we have filter uh this is just the same thing as what this does but it's just a your a separate thing I guess it's just if you don't want to use the Distortion you can just use this filter um EQ it's exactly what it sounds like it's just your standard EQ that you know just does does the thing um it I feel like okay uh let me just say this right off the bat I might sound like I'm going too fast but if you are a beginner watching this obviously none of this will make any sense but if you're in advanced or if you're looking to become an advanced producer in you're an intermediate stage then you should know what an EQ is by now so I don't I shouldn't have to explain it if you don't know what an EQ is then you probably should spend more time on the beginner tutorial and maybe make a few of your own songs and eventually you figure out what an EQ is and then you come back anyways so I just don't want to be too boring for people who already know what this stuff is because I know that if I explained literally everything like I thought adsr was a little bit too slow for explaining but hopefully that's helpful for somebody you okay flinger uh I can't tell you what this does but it does a thing to me a flinger and a phaser feel like they're doing the same thing with different uh what would it be called like different sound it's different sounds of the same thing that's kind of my take I it even looks like they're doing the same thing I'm not sure what they're doing uh I think it has something to do with the phase uh don't ask it's something pretty complicated but all I know is it can sound cool but sometimes it really messes up your master so lots of produc producers will avoid using a flinger and a phaser because they don't want it to affect their mix too much um Reverb uh very cool the Reverb in this is it's all right it's not bad I mean the reeverb isn't anything insane like maybe aala super massive or something uh we could add that or convolver or my favorite ROM ROM is the best Reverb uh it was free I don't know if it's free anymore I got it when it was free it was on some promotion uh this is a fantastic Reverb if you were looking for a good Reverb and you're I think I don't know if it's like 40 50 bucks this is completely worth it uh and I listen there there some plugins that I'm like okay there are it's hard to come by good reverbs let me just say that like so this is this is a good Reverb like if you're looking for a good Reverb highly recommend this one it just sounds so good oh my goodness okay anyways I'm going to stop ging at uh the ROM uh so different effects what did I miss compressor of course this is a OT t uh is the same thing as this so if you if you guys are familiar I need to turn off the attach this is annoying okay if you guys have used OT uh it's just this plugin right here this is so popular uh OT it's a it's a up and down compressor so downwards compressor um basically imagine you have like a line okay and a compressor as you bring down that line and then whatever the what's it called like the waveform if it went above that line it would just squash it under that line and compress that sound now the what happens with a upwards compressor is it does the exact opposite and I love upwards compressor what it does is I have a line and let's say my uh I have like a waveform whatever doesn't go to that line it's going to get lifted up to that line that's the way I understand it so it lifts up the low points and a compressor uh does the opposite or downwards compressor does the opposite brings the high points down uh so that's the difference I yeah I can't completely tell you if that's correct but I'm like 9% % sure that that's like about what's going on on a very basic level by the way if you're wondering I think OT sounds better than the Ott in vital I'm sorry I don't know why but uh this Ott is it's it's it's all right it's pretty good it still sounds better with it I think Okay cool so I pretty much went over the basics of sound design and I would say that this get got a little bit into the advaned ter territory uh not not quite there but the thing is is that I taught you how to become Advanced at sound sound design and that's by looking at different plugins and seeing which things carry over between them and then experimenting the heck out of everything and if you really want a advanced uh tip is to go to your master and then just spend time sound designing and just messing around while you have an Edison on your master and just click the record button right here and then what I'll do is I'll go back into my uh thing and I'll just mess around okay so like let's say you have something like that and you're like I don't know what you just did uh don't worry so I have this right here I go back to my uh playlist I can go to my Edison and as I was recording that I can actually click this button and it's going to put exactly what we just recorded into my track so then maybe I want uh that to be some like weird uh starting thing that I have that's just like the beginning of a track and then I stretch it a little bit and I make it some background element with Reverb and I click control L and I add that and I put some like huge Reverb on it and then I I don't know do something like this this and then I P P that down and then maybe I add some like crazy grossy thing to it where it like has some crazy maybe I C it up so as you can see you can do so much from just messing around in your synthesizer recording with Edison on your master and it will record all crazy things that happened in your synthesizer so if you miss something you're like oh that sounded really cool and you still have it recorded in Edison and you can use that later as samples uh for your for your music obviously this was like a really random weird example I probably never use this in a in a song but it's still interesting and you can still mess around like that and I know I went really fast with that I'm going to show you guys more about sampling uh later right right now we're just focused on the south sign aspect so also I don't know why that got applied to my master very interesting okay so uh right here I showed you guys pretty much I think everything I want to do and I the reason I did s design with vital is because I think right now vital is probably one of the best if not the best free synthesizer in my opinion I've been using it a ton is a huge I I love this I love this Bing that's all all I'm going to say uh Matrix okay so the Matrix is a little bit more I don't I would say more complicated to me than it is in serum but uh it's still it's still cool uh I don't really use the Matrix the whole time I used it a ton in in serum I haven't if I'm being completely honest I just haven't found myself needing it yet in vital but I know that is a huge what is it called uh like a huge benefit if you're doing some complex sound design uh The Matrix is going to allow you to more finely tune basically everything in so like let's say you have all the UI and it's kind of all spread out between these knobs and it can be hard to see like what's going on uh a matrix it kind of just simplifies it down to like basically inputs and outputs and very like uh almost like a pro programmer like language of how you use this uh I don't use this too much I used to in serum but with this I haven't spent the time to learn it so I don't want to teach you guys something that I don't feel 100% Comfort Comfort confident in but just know that uh there are good resources for the Matrix and I don't use that much and you don't need it to make it good sounds all right with that said uh the advanced again I have not really uh messed with this at all so Matrix in advance you don't even really need to make really good sounds in vital uh they're just extra things if you want to learn them so there you go and just with these Basics that I've taught you you can pretty much make uh any sound that you can imagine in your head like or any any sound you can imagine in your head any song that you any sound that you've heard in another song unless it's some super complicated dubstep sound like you'll probably be able to re remake that sound really easily just by knowing knowing these few basic things so with that being said I think that uh we're going to go to the next chapter and sound design this is my sound design um part for this chapter and let's go to the next one from here I also wanted to show you guys uh more indepth sound design that I've actually used in real songs that I have released on Spotify and I also would like to go over some layering techniques some automation techniques and I just thought okay you going to be way easier uh than just showing you guys each of these things individually it's just to go to a track I've already made and then show you guys how I used it in that particular track so right here I have a track I've made and I actually used um the uh Nitro pack that I added for free to my sample pack uh on my on my website so uh a lot of these uh samples I'm using a lot of these presets uh I used and you can get them too and use the exact same ones that I used uh in my samp pack on my website um also uh i' go over the exactly how I made this track completely in depth on my YouTube channel where I also release uh tutorials as well and that's just under my name trist wox as uh just so you guys can uh follow if you're interested so without further Ado I'm going to play what this sounds like and then we can go over exactly how I sound designed some of the things you can kind of get a snippet of uh some more indepth sound design for actual songs that I've used it for and we can talk about what I did so I released this as part of a challenge to make a song in one hour to see what I can make and this is actually what I made so I would like to go over a little bit of this because I think it's really cool how you can see the advanced production just condensed is like quickly as possible so I'm I'm going to be doing one more hour challenges and I'm going to release the full things and I think that this will also be a really helpful way way for you guys to get to see Advanced production action because you'll see what things I think make a song sound really good in the fastest amount of times you kind of see the whole process like compressed and then over a 40 hour period of some like really long Advanced course it would basically be that process but just like lengthened and added more time to it so I could just fill out the song and do a lot more stuff so with that being said uh let's go and see the sound design of the lead I think that that's really leader base first let's do let's do the base okay so I have the Bas here so as you can see I actually the pattern here is hugely important to the way the sound sound design of the base is made I have very short notes and then I have uh ones that go up an octave that help the lead or the base feel nice and bouncy so this melody would be completely ruined if I were to change the way my base was and made it like completely sustained for instance that actually sounds really cool never mind I was wrong uh so regardless uh let's go over uh how this base works so this base basically has a wave table that changes using this envelope um let's see what that sounds like and that's literally all that's going on with this oscillator uh in the effect section I added a tiny bit of course a lot of distortion I took out the highs and I added a compressor so really not too much going on so you might be thinking how does this sound so much better uh with um with the sound with it being so simple because if you copied exactly what I just did it would not sound anything near what the final sounds like and that's because of two things one being that on my base I have let me drag this so you guys can see it uh I actually let's do this um just make sure it's in view um I have uh different things going on on the base effect rack so I have a overdrive which is just adding a tiny bit of distortion I have an EQ which is affecting the way the balance of the sound is I have a sound cizer which uh yeah you can make fun of me now I love using sound cizer I don't know why it makes it sound good and I know a lot of people say it's terrible for your songs but I digress it sounds good um so that's it that's all I added and it just really beefs up the sound uh so that's really all that's going on with the base um I know it sounds cool but there's not too much going on I just had a little bit Distortion a little bit compression EQ here and there and then just try to keep it simple and I mean the end result I think it sounds pretty good uh I just added a couple other presets here as you can see and one of them was a one octave up just to add a little bit more a midbase field to the sound so I have actually three oscillators you can almost think of it as layering three separate bases which is part of sound design is layering so uh this you could think of this uh preset as having three different layers if if you will and then I just uh changeed the levels of this to get the desired sound I want if I were to change this it could change dramatically so you can see just just by changing those around it can really affect the the sound uh next I have the lead sound now the the reason that this one sounds so quiet is because of the different automations when everything's when all the automations are turned on this lead is a lot louder but we can still listen to it so look at how many times I play the same note in a row one two three three I'm going to count that four even though there's slide five six yeah six times so six times in a row I get away with playing the exact same note so your Melodies do not have to go up and down like crazy to create a really uh cool melody in my opinion uh you don't need to make them super complicated just make it easier for the ear to follow and catchy and this works because I have a cool Basse pattern going and then this assist I play the same lead and with the drums it just kind of hits at the same time so it's like oh what's going to happen because you hear like let me just show you so like like three times you hear it hit and you're like waiting for something to happen it's like all right let's let's just turn on everything here it's like almost like you think it might you think the melody might start then the second time but then nothing happens the third time nothing happens and then same I'm like just pushing your expectation just a little bit further and you're like uh and then and then it's cool because I removed all the drums here and then it they came back in so you can see how like my entire production is revolving around like I I just made a heart uh Revol Ving around what I think would be essentially like cool like I'm like okay well if I'm playing the same three notes right here I'll remove all the drums to build up like anticipation for when my melody does start um if I was just a music producer and I wasn't an artist I would just be like like I I would never think uh I would never think of that I I might just put the drums all the way across because that's like a normal thing to do and it might just sound like pretty boring it doesn't have the same feel uh in my opinion so that's that's one thing is that like you're influencing your decisions and your production techniques based off of what idea you have and so that's the key thing to being an artist is that you're actually the process of music production changes based off of what you're trying to accomplish and so if you don't have that uh if you don't have that like okay so when you start off you might not have an exact idea for what you want to make you just start making something but then an idea that you kind of realize that there was a reason behind all the actions that you were doing and all the choices you were making and you can if if you can kind of like hold on to that then you can like make the whole song around that idea it's I know this is sounds so complicated but it's really just like an experience that you have to have making music and I have shared this experience with so many different people who make music they know exactly what I'm talking about there's something that you can kind of like feel and you're like yeah this is the direction I need to go and then once you can kind of hold on to that and like make the whole song around it that's really when you're uh making doing like doing art it's not just like uh the difference is that if you're just kind of making music and doing stuff and you're not feeling anything and there's no idea that's like kind of pulling you to to make certain production decisions then I don't think that you're really making music if that makes sense like there's a there's a a huge difference between those two uh and I know I've already mentioned this like four times but I just really want to drive it home that point because it's so important uh but anyways I digress again so let's listen to some of the cooler things I did with my drums here so I showed you oh wait I didn't show you my lead s design my bad guys okay so uh lead is not too complicated I just have uh it's it's almost the same as my base I think I took my Basse preset and literally just pitched it up I'm not even kidding and then I think I changed the wave table that was it uh so this is actually the same as my base so I literally did the exact same thing I might have just changed the envelope a little bit and that was the only difference I made and then for the second lead I just changed it so the a part of My Melody has has one has one sound as you can hear this is the a so this is like the a part of my melody and this is the B part with a different sound and again we can distinguish the A and the B parts of My Melody based off of the Rhythm that they're playing so technically this is like a b c c okay and the A and the B are kind of using the same the same melody or the same sound okay to introduce the the next part and so I actually I kind of belabor the point of my of My Melody by changing the instrument when it changes the Rhythm and changes uh Melodies is I I want to kind of emphasize that change by changing the sound so if I use the same sound the whole way through I feel like this would be incredibly boring so like I can I can show you what that sound like it would sound like this so it's sound like this I mean it's still cool I not even going to lie it is kind of cool but it's just not the same it it sounds cooler when it changes here I I also noticed that it also sounded cooler when I changed it because I forgot that my automations changed and at the end of the automation it actually shifted the sound entirely so this actually would have worked anyways and got the same thing I just did it differently here anyways uh you probably are wondering about this sound right here and if you were just watching my sound design section you would have saw exactly how I did this technique and if you are really clever you might have actually known how I made this sound so if I go into my piano roll and open up fidal you can see that I actually have this aane all the way up I don't know why it's so short that doesn't really matter though uh and I have an LFO which has my frequency on seconds so it does that exact that that thing I was talking about where it goes like and then it like lengthens out you saw me messing around with that it's doing that with vital so hold on let me go to attached view sorry I know this is like so messy here I'm trying to get it organized so you guys can see what's going on uh let's just close it thing and then reopen it back up okay okay let's go here so you see you see what's changing down in this LFO that's that's what's going on and I'm automating that uh LFO with a automation here you can see I'm the LFO frequency see going down here so as it goes down it increases in seconds so that is what I'm doing so I just want to show you a real life example of me automating a knob in vital in my song to make an effect that I was trying to get uh anyways okay so I'm going to take this off to attach because I can't say uh let's go to my drums and now I I showed you guys the lead and the bases it's so simple I literally just had one uh synth for each and then I just processed the the lead and the lead processing was so so simple what I did was I basically actually used my my base what's it called my base uh uh insert as a bus for my lead in my base and you might be going like what in the world you put your lead into your base I did and it and it kind of works so I'm not even going to lie I think the reason it works is because the compression of the lead and the base go together before it gets recompressed on the master and that's why it's so like uh kind of loud and it just works so for my lead preset I literally just have fresh air which uh kind of increases the highing gives it a little bit more crispiness um I have Crush automations which are just bit crush and those turn on and off throughout the song and kind of highlight different parts of the melody with bit crush and I have another KZ bit Crush all these are free plugins by the way delay very cool I don't think I ended up using this but it is a very cool plugin and then I just cut out some of the lows so it left some room for the base and then I boost to the highs again so that's what I did and then on my lead I also always make sure to add white noise so the reason I do this is because it fills up all that highend so I pitch the White Noise up to 48 uh and then I just have it hit on it depends on how you want it but I kind of automate it so that the white noise gives it more crispy like Snap because if I take this out and play it see how lame that sounds but then when I add White Noise has so much more energy it's like it's like not even comparable so if you're not using white noise you're really shooting yourself in the foot is terms of like energy for these type of music uh and obviously you may not be making this type of music but still white noise is is huge so let's play the drums and just listen what the sound first of all I am complimenting my kick drum by having uh these claps and ride so and then this is an example of just percussion uh that I added in I'm like oh it sound cool and this is literally me this is the process of advanced production I'm going here and going oh but happened if I took this this symbol and like Shunk it down like to a fourth of its side just played it over and over and over again right here it's like and then I increase the volume of these very slowly so it's was like and then that's literally what I'm doing I'm just like sitting here like minutely changing these things to make something that sounds cool that's like that's Advanced production a beginner they just would like pull a sample and this is nothing wrong with this I do this all the time sometimes it's actually better like you'll see over in the beginning of my song I did I just literally pulled the seatics hiphop drum Loop because I was like oh this sounds good and and that's fine but I also know how to make drum Loops too it's not like I don't know what I'm doing like I just did it because it sounded good and that's the end quality that I wanted but I I'm also capable and this is I think the thing you don't want to be using tools that take away from the skill that you don't have so you should be able to do pretty much everything but on your own and then just use the tools as complimentary things that aren't holding up your production but are like helping you do things that you already know how to do but just uh saving you time or uh improving your creative work so yeah whoops uh so I also took the kick and reversed it so it kind of like sucks it back in the kick right here you hear that going if so that just keeps it interesting just like little tidbits here and there and these this is just the type type of stuff that happens when you're like working for long times on tracks I mean this one obviously was an hour so I didn't have a ton of time but uh it was uh quite fun to add a all of stuff in so I'm trying to think what else I can show you guys so I uh added a obviously automations here and there to exemplify different parts of the melody the A and B Parts uh by automating different aspects of the of the sound and I also have reeverb automations that go in between the notes so that uh the Reverb plays when there's no note playing so it kind of fills that space a little bit and then I always make sure that I have a little bit of a background noise going in the background so that you can uh it fills up those empty gaps and doesn't make the song sound so dry so like if I take this out you can see the difference is absolutely massive so and there was other parts I took out so some things I mute because I'm like I I didn't like the way that turned out so like I I guess I had this I don't know what this was so I said okay I don't like that so I took it out so you can mute ideas overtime too and some things that don't fit and that's perfectly fine so that's just part of the process um I don't know how much more I have to show you guys I guess other than maybe this 808 was like really cool uh it sounded pretty interesting so like if I go to the beginning of the track here so I literally just took the same base and it's just automated different things to make it fit uh it's just like your standard 808 sound I thought it I thought it was really cool and I kind of reuse things to make uh make it go faster so I reuse this base uh from the drop as my 808 in this part of the hiphop song uh so that's kind of what I did um I'm trying to think what else to show you guys I use delay to have a cool intro effect here so that's why it sounds like it's repeating itself over and over you hear that like let me turn it off and you'll you'll hear the difference in like what goes on when I turn that off okay let's play now here there's like no repeating and then like let me turn the this delay back on you'll see the the effect I had I think it was huge I think that this really made see how cool that is I I love that delay effect I a friend show it to me and I've been using it like ever since um I have this really cool thing I do in the in the beginning of all my songs with convolver so if you want to steal my signature artist thing that I do go for it uh so basically this is what it sounds like I have a convolver on the master and right here what this does is it basically I put the preset on B and then I automated it from 100% to zero and and if I turn like the pink noise all the way up in any part of the song you'll hear what it does it like just washes everything out it sounds so cool and so epic I love like doing that to like kind of introduce a new part of the song so uh I showed you guys about layering I showed you guys about layering different sounds uh the one thing I didn't describe to you guys is that uh each sound that I picked in this particular track I had a specific Place board so I picked the three different um oscillators in my base because I wanted a mid base I wanted a sign subbase and I wanted a another low base so that's why I picked three different sways and they're all serving a different purpose then I picked my lead and I picked it and I'm like okay the lead will go in the higher uh range so that's why I cut the low or the highs out of the base so that the highs for my lead would fit there and you can kind of see my my head working like I'm like okay I don't want the base to have a ton of highs because I know the lead is going to have a lot of highs and so I'm sound designing and doing my sound selection based off of the needs of my track so I'm not just adding a ton of sounds throwing sounds at the wall until something sticks what I'm doing is I'm selectively and subconsciously picking sounds that fit the the ENT the entire hole I did the hard thing again uh to fit the entire hole the way that I'm looking to do so that's how you should be picking out sounds it's uh pick out sounds like you're putting stuff in your fridge from the grocery store you have like you wouldn't just Chuck everything in the in the fridge you have to like methodically go okay I have room for this here this here I need something that's going to fit here so I'll put something here and you're like methodically packing everything packing is also a great example there's so many different examples I can use for mixing it's like packing it's like you have a ton of clothes that you need to fit for your trip and you're packing them in certain spots and if you just chuck all your clothes in there there's a very low likelihood that it's going to fit together so if your mix sucks it's probably because you're throwing a bunch of random stuff in your suitcase and you're not actually deciding okay do I actually need to bring this is this useful nope going to check that out because that's just a random Pizza tshirt that I don't need so there's just like random things that you put in there it's probably not going to sound very good so just be very what is the word like intentional um and and uh it'll become subconscious over time of what sounds you're putting in there but basically try to fill everything up so everything has its particular spot and nothing's fighting for space amongst each other and you won't need to have a million eqs eqing everything because the sounds that you pick will just fit so well together that they don't need anything else um last thing I guess I could go over uh within this track uh that will show some more advanced production techniques is the fact that I used um my master I literally I showed you the convolution thing I added an OT this is hilarious I have no idea why this OT is on my master but it sounded really good for this song I don't normally endorse this I think that putting this OT on your master it probably is going to make mess up a lot of stuff for some reason it just sounds good and I listen to my mix and mono too and I think it's okay so uh sometimes the sck stuff works but I wouldn't recommend it and sometimes it can get you in hot water so I think I accidentally added this and I just kept it so sometimes that happens um happy accidents Bob R Us uh so with my fruity balance I usually have a fruity balance to just turn down everything and then I Master it uh this for some reason I didn't uh I'll show you a different example that this EQ barely boosting barely uh cutting just very basic stuff here um if you guys can't see my master chain I'm sorry I realized that is probably out of key okay there we go now it's now it's better um so I have my uh parametric EQ just barely cutting barely doing anything make sure to turn the linear button on if this is your master EQ because you uh don't want to create phasing issues or any different issues like that um fresh air I do this just to boost the highs of the entire track it fantastic uh this is a Frank pull free plugin it's called inflator it's based off of the Oxford inflator uh again it's an upwards compressor and I use this on my track to kind of bring up the low points and just make it sound more full um then I added a midside EQ so I could dynamically boost the mono subbase and I could cut the wide base on my track and boost the the side highs so the width of a track in the mono of a track I have separated in two different eqs that are both on linear mode and then I boost uh the EQ on the side in the side of my headphones I boost the highs in the sides and I cut the the base in the sides the low subbase and then in the mono frequencies I boost this sub and I don't really do anything with the with the rest of the mix and if you want this uh I have it also in my sample pack but it's so easy to make and I would feel if I didn't just show you uh just how to make it yourself so this is what it is it's just this this is what the midside splitter looks like you just open up Patcher put this here and then you just uh take one of the outputs put it to an and the other output to another EQ and then you drag it back to FL Studio like so and then that will give you a midside EQ which is probably one of the most nerdy but like cool things to do is to midside EQ everything and uh dynamically control the way your sound sounds with different uh and your mono and wide I I do I love doing that it's one of my favorite mixing techniques and it honestly will level up your Productions like from here to here if you just start using midside EQ uh in my opinion uh soft Clipper this is just my limiter cuz I didn't pay for anything so this is my free limiter is it just a soft Clipper so just goes to show I used to use pro2 I loved it and then I'm my computer crossed I lost everything and now I'm back to soft Clipper so there there you have it uh two last things I can show you is on my the C the for stands for I don't know what it stands for so I'm not going to make it up uh you click that it's not your master and I put a span on here and this just helps me see what's going on in my track dynamically with my EQ and this is pretty much the best like like as terms of a mix like if you're just like looking at that like look at this it's like it's beautiful like this is the what you are aiming for you like you have the the base and then it lowers off in the muddy region and then the mids aren't overtaking the entire track but then the highs are boosted up again to the human ear this sounds really good this sounds really good uh this is kind of what you're looking for if you have too much going on in here gets out a little bit muddy if you have too much going in here it might take away uh the balance of the track it might take away from the dynamic of it if you have a lot going on in here you're going to have a lot of energy in your track if you have a lot going in here it's going to it's going to it's going to hit it's going to hit hard okay in the in the cars so if you want to hear what it sounds like in your car without going to your car uh Frank pole has another amazing plugin called uh Inspector Gadget uh no it's not called Inspector Gadget it's called inspector 2 and you can click this on and it'll simulate different environments so I gu simulates like a really bad speaker I don't know what that is outside the club is just this is all you hear is just low it's your side mix invert the polarity swap the sides and just hear the offset left and right solo super great I love this and then I just turned it off uh and then yeah so that's my master chain I showed you my mix chains I showed you how I layer I showed you how I do my effects I showed you how how to do my automations I show you how to do rhythms with drums sorry for talking so much um and I showed you how it's okay to use samples and Loops but it's also good to make your own and that you shouldn't use it as crutches but it's using samples a completely legitimate way of producing um what else to talk about I guess Arrangement uh so arrangement I have I try to have some rhythmic element in every part of my track except for the the com the first like eight bars sometimes I'll have it very washed out and you're like oh what's going on it sounds cool and then it like goes straight into like the the Bas in go straight into this part so that's something I'll do um what else I have the buildup here obviously this is a certain style of music so you're thinking like okay this is EDM uh so or electronic dance music particular this would be Basse house maybe future house uh is um that's kind of the what your what genre it would fit in um if you don't make this type of music that's fine your Arrangements is going to just look different uh but these producing techniques are Universal and where you can take these techniques I've taught you to any genre I've made hiphop before I've made pop rock all kinds of different in learning EDM is I think the single greatest asset you can do to improve your production in all areas because electronic music production teaches you every area of music production whereas if I just do instrumentals I'm not going to learn a lot of flu because I don't need to with electronic music production there's so many different techniques that so many people use that it just you can learn so much and then and then reapply it to certain specific genres so if you make hiphop and you just practice your electronic music production I think that it will really help you with hiphop uh this is something that I learned is that I people who I make hiphop for they're like wow these songs are like really interesting I haven't heard something like this it's because I'm not a hiphop producer I'm a EDM producer who tried to make hiphop by listening to some things and so my takes on things and my Beats and stuff that I make gets out a lot more interesting and not like copy paste what other hiphop producers do because of just you come from a different place so experiment by making lots of different genres and will actually improve the overall quality of all your music across the board uh that's one thing that you can take from this so uh I hope this was help I just went through this part uh now we're going to go to the next part of the tutorial and I'll see you there in this chapter I'm going to show you uh some other tips that have to do with Melodies harmonies and just overall uh instrumentation and layering so right here I have what's called a layer if you go to plus uh you can add in a layer I forgot I already forgot where it was uh there it is right there so you can add in a layer and what that will do is it allow you to play two instruments at the same time on your keyboard so I added one Labs piano fre sampler by the way lives are fantastic and then I added another preset here but when I click my layer it plays both at the same time which is really cool so the way I did this is that I selected all of these at the same time with my layer open and you click set children and then this uh becomes a parent uh congratulations he's the father so uh we're going to go to the piano roll and we have this layer right here and when I whenever I place a note it's going to play both of these instruments at the same time so you can hear the piano at the same time so now I'm going to go through some of the uh some of the midi that I have from my sample pack uh again my sample Pack's on my website if you're interested and uh and right here I'm just going to use some of the mini as an example of different ways you can make Melodies and uh just understand uh Melody and Harmony making so let's just start with the first one I have no idea what this sounds like whoa so fast all right let's slow this down to like 110 Maybe so as you can see uh let's just uh simplify this down so uh I have this one Baseline going and this is just a normal Baseline like this is pretty much as simple as it gets and then on top of this I just added uh another uh note the compliment it another Harmony there two different notes and you see right here that I have an a b a b Melody why is that because this a parts match together and then the rhythm of these B Parts match together because these two notes at the end are matching so I have a b a b okay and then with that Melody I added another on top of there and then this uh has its own pattern to it um which somehow works in the in the process of the whole even though that they're actually kind of all different but I still say it's a a b anyways um but it's a little bit more complex uh basically I just kind of this is just trial and eror just like placing okay I have this pattern or idea or Motion in my head what am I trying to get out on here like I just kind of had this idea I'm like okay uh let's uh like here's a better example I want to start from scratch I'll just make ail you guys can kind of see what I'm doing so it's like I I can't sing but you get the idea this something like you know you can make all kinds of different Melodies and I just there's like pretty much like an infinite array of different Melodies that could be played on top of this but a lot of it comes from uh just kind of experience I guess is the best way to put it uh I made lots of bad Melodies and so by making lots of bad Melodies over and over again you can kind of see um I just want to show you a lot of Melody so you can kind of see the patterns between them and hopefully get a better sense of like what uh you can be looking at when you're trying to make good Mel so let's skip this one I want to make okay let's see what this is so again I have this uh interesting thing so these are basically just chords and then I have it playing almost like an art Melody so I can have I could have had this like this like this this was a completely valid and thing I could have done but it sounds interesting when I have it playing like an art so just experiment with maybe it sounds better if your chords are playing more of an art Melody uh maybe that leads into the melody overall as a whole um so that's another thing that you could uh try to experiment with um let's keep going and see what other Melodies I have here that's a little complicated to skip that so as you can see here I have a very simple uh like cor progression because it just it does it's not like a complicated Rhythm you know it's just playing like these four bars and it's just if I delete everything else but selected you can hear how simple this is so if I select um int selection and then just delete this a very simple core progression and then this melody on top of it is what gives it all the depth that it has and um I think that doing that is by having a solid if you build a solid Baseline you can build a solid core progression on top of that and you can make a solid Melody on top of that or you can go the reverse Direction I tend to find that either by building a strong base you can it can inspire a melody or if you have a strong Melody it can Inspire everything below it so you know what why don't we just try making a corporation maybe that that'll help you guys so uh something that you could do is just start with a Basse so I'll do it both ways I'll start with the melody one time and I'll start with a base another so let's just copy this this is very mysterious very interesting so so what if I do something like so I'm going to add a middle notes to these this is kind of interesting I'm trying to figure out exactly how to how to pars it here then you can take these middle notes and you can go up and active I'm not sure how I'm feeling about this Corporation so far I wonder what this sounds like it's interesting um it's definitely I guess I don't know what the word is I'm not 100% feeling it yet so what I might do is I might take uh these notes and just uh put them up an octave as as you can see for me it's a lot of trial on there seeing what sounds good not like good right off the bat that doesn't sound very good either somehow every single one of these notes sounds bad I like that I don't like that chord so you can see like sometimes like Melodies they they don't come too easily so sometimes like starting the Baseline didn't really work that time so like I'm going to try a melody it's also difficult and I notic this uh from recording other times as well is that uh long periods of silence for me uh happen because I'm thinking and I'm also trying to produce and teaching and producing are like two different sides of my brain so like I almost cannot do it at the same time and switching between them as you can see is a very difficult for me and also makes it really hard to make Melodies and a lot of times I'll spend even longer making really bad Melodies until something good comes up uh so it just goes to show that not every time you open up the pan roll you're going to make something awesome and sometimes you could use a different source of inspiration so for that reason why don't I try finding a sample and maybe that can uh help me come up with a cool melody or something that could help ins Spark some inspiration so what I'm going to do is I'm going to open up adsr sample manager and this is so awesome because if you download free sample packs or buy sample packs what happens is is that they can all be stored in adsr Sample manager and then I can search up different types of samples and it will sort them for me automatically and I can cool very quickly find something I'm looking for so I'm going to look up for a cool drum sample uh sample and then just scroll and then I only want Loops so I'm going to click off of that Arrow okay so 110 that sounded really cool I'm going to use this metal Rhythm and I'm going to turn it down in octave just to see what it sounds like that's really cool okay so I'm going to go back here and I'm going to search up instead of drums I'm going to find some type of weird guitar Loop Maybe and Just scroll down that's really interesting okay so now we have this okay this is really cool so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this sample and I'm actually going to put it uh why so what uh I'm going to teach you guys how to use the sampler and I'm going to teach you guys how to make Melodies so I'll just do both at the same time kill two BRS with one stone uh so except there will be no death in making this video okay so uh when I open up the sample here is I just double click on any sample and I can change different uh thing things and qualities about it so right there I turned down the pitch of the sample down an octave uh there's also reverse I could reverse the sample that's also kind of cool uh you can do all sorts of things I can change how how long it takes before the sample goes in I can change how long it takes till the sample goes out I can cross fade it uh which is really complicated but really cool um if I click not this wrench tool but if I click the other tool it lets me boost the volume of that I can clip I can clip it I do that a lot for drums and make it sound really cool um you can also add stereo delay which is going to make it sound really wide but it is going to mess up the stereo image slightly all the St image is fine right now so I'll leave you that with the stereo widened and then I'll control L with this guitar as well I'm going to add a CH to this guitar because I feel like that would sound really cool so I'm just add a vintage chorus turn that down I'm going to cut out the lows out of the and then this is just a a loop so I still need to add like drums so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to uh my own sample pack this is not the one I'm selling but this is just the one I've built over time so I'm going to just find some kind of cool clap here it's like a hiphop clap that's fine we'll just use this one so we have oh I want it I want it fast just like this and then I need a high hat so I need the high hat to kind of just play over and over again a very fast I had like yeah perfect just something like this and then I'm going to go to my pain tool and just paint across I'm going to put contr l and then I'm going to add pancake onto it and what pancake does is it's funny because I had pancakes R this morning uh pancakes is pancakes pancake 2 is going to change the St image to go left and right so it'll make it more interesting for our high house you hear going back and forth and then you know why don't we add a crazy Reverb on this and then have it uh just Decay over time it just gets uh turned down over time so we we'll just turn that uh Decay or turn the Reverb off then create an automation like this and then have it start all the way at the top and then lower over time and then we could have it go like a crazy 808 just hit really hard and then we could have a kick uh let's make a kick and clap a combo here that's perfect just use that kick so have it kind of go late just the easiest drum Loop of all time and then just copy and paste that over and over again so we'll just select uh the drums that we have here highlight them uh select that part of the song and only the drums and control bbbbb and then it's going to put that exactly over and over again for us and then to make it really interesting let's zoom in here copy this drum again paste it click make unique as sample and then go here and then reverse it and then we can just uh not stretch it but we can click off a stretch then we can turn this down oh my goodness I can't click turn this down like that like so and then that will make it so that it kind of slides uh and then we'll just take that out and then make it a little bit longer and then we'll add a base here so now we need to add an 808 so this 808 uh we want it to H hard so we are going to put an 808 Loop here uh and I'm going to go to vital and I'm going to go to whatever 808 sample I have and I'm just going to put contr l and then I'm going to go and find the exact so I save all my presets and I save all of my effects for those presets so I have file save mixer track state as so if I make any changes to this mixer I add things I like at the end of it I can go on this mixer right click go to file save as and I can save and type in the name that I want that mixer preset to be and I can go to my um the the sound that's going to that mixer and then go up here to the file go save preset as and then I click that and I name it the exact same thing so that I can open up my sound and I can open up my mixture preset for that sound every time I want it so then I have uh I can save my work from other songs and put them in in over time so so I'm never like losing my work uh and it helps you be a better producer over time because then you can have your work carry over you know so that's pretty cool uh let's make an 88 preset I don't really like the state away so we're going to change it it's just too I don't know it's not really working for me so let's find something else let's see did I make another one maybe I don't have one see if I can make something quick here we'll just copy paste this and then change the thing it hits it's not really fitting for me I'm not really deing the 808 pattern right here at all I think it's not it's because I don't like uh the patch either so I'm going to change the flex I'm just going to go to premade 808 so I don't take forever on making something but as you can see lots of ideas and lots of things that you try are not going to work first try and the point is not to try something it doesn't work and then quit because that's what a beginner producer does uh an advanced producer Tres something it doesn't work owns up to the fact that it didn't work and try something else again um and I made plenty of hiphop songs before but not every single one turns out the way I wanted to and not every idea turns out the same so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to find a different thing and see if I can make it work first of all it's because this is out of key so I need to fix that and then I can also fix it a little bit by just maybe clipping it here instead m so it's not I mean yeah this happens this is my like favorite song in the entire world um I wish I could have made something more interesting here I had an idea and I kind of lost it already because it's kind of taking me too long uh which happen so I might need to come up with a different new idea again I think that part of the issue with uh trying to show Advanced production live for me is uh that the part of my brain that explains and the part of my brain that produces two different parts and sometimes it takes me 5 minutes to make something really cool sometimes it makes me it takes me 2 hours and obviously I don't have that kind of like I don't have the luck that every single idea I come up with that hopefully while I'm making the tutorial live that it's going to be good but um that's just the way it is sometimes so uh hopefully by me not being able to make something cool you guys could to learn something too and that it's encouraging that not every time that you sit down at the computer you're going to make something but I forgot what saying it was but it's uh that sometimes that it's inevitable that you're going to make something something good you just have to sit through the production times of making bad things over and over again to get them out of the way until the good thing comes along so hopefully that's encouraging for you is that every time that you sit the computer don't expect to make something good but rather just go hey if I make something bad that's one less bad thing I have until I make something good so just think just change your mind mindset a little bit differently and then hopefully that will encourage you to make better things so uh I showed you guys about the sampler and different things that you can do in the sampler uh one thing that I really like to do also is is go to stretch Pro and then change this and this just format shifts it so you can have all kinds of really cool stuff here I still really like this beginning part it's really chill uh it's really cool so um that's just uh just another example just the format shifting I love doing that to vocals sounds really cool and then um putting this on stretch Pro also if I change this an octave down it won't change the but if I uh put this just on stretch listen into it now with stretch Pro it like tries to retain the same format it's interesting it it's quite interesting so I really like using the format shift the stretch Pro whenever they added that huge huge I love that update so much so that's just something cool uh also you can change the octave by uh right clicking on these notes this will change it so just another way for you to change the picture if you need to go a little bit further in pitch um anyways so I showed you guys how to use the sampler I showed you guys uh different ways that you can use samples in your Productions uh and I also showed you guys uh a little bit about making Melodies uh the funny thing was is that uh pretty much all the Melodies I made today were not good and then all the samples I tried using in production also weren't good but I did like this um this one percussion Loop here editing that to make it fit with this beginning part that at least was kind of interesting um so hopefully you guys got to saw a little bit of that U maybe I could pull up another production and then show you guys a different example of something that I did turn out well and then we'll go with that right now all right so I found a project that I worked on and this was something I made a little while ago and this shows a better example of how you can use samples and Melodies uh more effectively and just making a very simple production so this was just a very basic idea I made so this was a sample I made and that come from and that came from this and I love that was a weird ending uh I love uh using these samples just as quick idea starters for me um they really help me when I making music but this is something uh that I made uh it just has a few different patterns so this is one of them so you see I have multiple layers going on at the same time so I have let's just play the bass in this one so you see I have a call it's kind of like asking a question you can almost see that this this first part right here is just asking a question and then this is an answer this ask the same question again but with a different base so it's like almost like a different I don't even know and then a different answer and then it plays the same again goes over again and then add the same thing again with a different base pattern and then finishes off by the kind of completing the whole thing and then it repeats the whole thing and then I have a different completely different pattern going in the background this so as you can see I have a counter Melody here I have my main Melody here and I have my 808 base just playing a very simple Melody here and when all these things combine I with the melody and the counter Melody and the Basse you have a full uh more complete track and then what I did was I actually exported that Melody out and then messed with it around by pitching it down and changing the way it was formed and stuff and then added tons of effects to it so you see add these kind of effects I could have made it even more interesting by adding like a chorus done all kinds of stuff I could have done like update presser try that that might be a little bit too much but you know what there's like different things you can try here so uh try sampling your own Melodies so like make melodies a sample out of it by going up here right clicking going to consolidate track and then from track start or song Start whichever one you'd like and then what that's going to do is is going to consolidate that into a meel uh into a sample and then you can use that sample to either develop your own sample packs or to make your own tracks and that's what I mostly use it for so I hopefully this was a better example than me uh failing multiple times on how to make uh Melodies and how to uh make just beats and just like um uh how to use samples uh in your Productions but hopefully this was a uh a good um a better example of what can happen so uh and notice that I made this probably when I wasn't recording and when I was just kind of like oh I have this idea in my head and then it just kind of happen so um those are two different ways that you can produce and so hopefully that was more helpful for you uh you may have been wondering why it took me so long to release this course and I want to tell you I have tried recording this course so many times and just to prove it I'm actually going to show you one of the versions of this course and never got released it was me making a 1hour challenge and then that 1hour challenge I was going to take and then collab with my friend who's going to record vocals his guitar we're going to record all everything and then we're going to finish that song and then I was going to analyze the collab edit that we did together as the final uh thing for the for the full Advanced uh uh tutorial so I thought hey why not just add that onto the tutorial I've already gotten finished so I did so I'm added after this you're going to see a another 1our section of me making a 1 hour challenge just to show you what the advanced uh production technique looks like when it's condensed into a shorter time frame and I you can tell in that video I was really not feeling it I was like I I don't know if this is going to turn into anything I was just I was nervous I wasn't sure I record the video so many times I was like it's probably just be another take I'm not going to use but I am going to use it and you know what I'm going to show you what the final track between uh me and blender base turned out like and it's not even close to finished which is sad but hey it happens uh and the project file that I have is uh kind of I'm going to try to find it I'm going to try to reop it and then I'll analyze that after I show you the 1 hour challenge and then I'll try to do that as well just to kind of finish out on a strong note so without further Ado uh I'm just going to play this uh version of the song and then uh I will show you the 1 hour challenge and from there I will go into the project for this one hour challenge that is corrupted and some of it doesn't work but I still want to show you at least what we got done um so I'll play this and then you can see the one hour challenge and see how it cut to this point all right he in the front seat listening to the car and you H the horiz behind me looking at the dashboard fast FL and driving front SE listen to the G and you in Rise behind me looking at the dashboard fast forward driv to oh a anyways so that is super crazy uh super interesting a lot of it is like stuff I've never made before he's never made before it's just like this crazy idea is Just Happening uh a lot of it is like really experimental is the word I'd use it's not like something you listen to on the radio it's kind of like what is this like I've never heard anything like this but it's cool it's it's fun to make stuff like this um anyways uh so now here's the one hour challenge and when you come back from this and see what I worked on for an hour you can see what uh blend base uh helps collab on so let's let's check it out okay okay so my first attempt I forgot to hit the timer so I'm gonna have to restart so this is going to be attempt two so let me repare my notepad this is attempt two and this time I'm actually going to start the timer let's just open up a new thing of FL FL fresh and then we're just going to collapse everything in the browser all right now I'm just going to hit the timer and we are going to go so let's try this again attempt two this time I hit the timer so I'm actually doing the challenge that's unfortunate uh okay so I'm going to start off last time we started off with the drums and it's kind of sounded interesting but this time I want to start off with a piano so we're going to do a little bit different um let's see I want to pick something cool like I want to make something that's like like house drums but like acoustic so I want to try something interesting basically go here let me turn my notifications off on my phone so Focus uh can Volver I highly recommend I actually when I would produce I put my phone in a different room it was actually really helpful um but I mean obviously if you have people that you need be into contact with obviously keep your phone with you okay let's stick this here okay is this is like your stereotypical pop song if I've ever heard it okay let's get started uh this is let's just keep it with the piano honestly this is going to be just keep things simpler um the only thing that could make this more stereotypical is if I added rain so let's do that um let's go to recordings no no just kidding not there um where is it my samples rendered also if you notice I don't talk a lot when I produce this is uh the problem every almost every single time I recorded this is that uh I found that I literally barely talk when I'm trying to make music so when I start explaining I actually do worse so that being said uh if I'm quiet for most of the time uh the second half is going to be more me explaining this as I said before so that's why I'm trying to separate in my head that way I can focus on just making good music okay let's add another Labs no just kidding it's going to be I need like a really really electric guitar very electric come on that was loud oh these are Bas guitars I'm blind it's like to it's called like aggressive for I need like a a bass guitar here that's going to just be in the background and kind of oh that's nice I like that one you you'll hear my idea in a second here I'm just going to go there we go I m this B is like I was a little too um that was super cool I literally just accidentally hit the Z key on my keyboard with the the clap and it sounded so cool hold on that could be like a snare sample right ooh complete accident okay let's keep going um 140 I like that a lot using samples cuz I have to Speed it along here otherwise I wouldn't make my own own drum right now okay I want to see what key we're in 1 billion per so I'm going to take the chords here paste in the melody and see what it tells me a Maj for sure okay for sure for sure a Maj okay I can see if I have a vocal and aart major and waste a little bit of time yeah I'm going to do that okay let's go to ad adsr sample manager I can't remember if I already explained this because I know I for sure did in the first first tutorial but I mean the first attempt of this but I don't know if I have used this yet so I'm just going to look up another air major it's crazy like when I actually just focus on making music and like and not explaining everything I swear I make like 10 times better stuff okay I'm going to look up vocal there's literally only one vocal in each chart maybe I don't really like it put a major as well and I'll also do I want multiple multiple keys it's fine could be a different key it's not big deal that could be cool if I pitch it down and like you couldn't really tell so it needs to be like that oh w oh a okay so I have that so far uh okay I'm going to check my time no I'm not going to check my time I'm not going to cheat all right Focus your you need to make some type of drop some type of okay I already have an idea I have an idea okay so we're at 140 BPM I'm not even going to make a buildup straight up just going to go like just like that so it's literally going to stop right on this I need to get rid of that tiny little H hit right there oh that kind of sounds dope like if you have it like okay this is going to go this is this is going to be a little bit crazy because I'm just GNA I need a kick that just hits hard just a just an absolutely devastating kick like because I'm going to make something something loud here need a kick manager this is the best like how hard kick is like the least hard oh that's CU it's stretching the sample whoops okay that's yeah that's a lot um no too too much o was this a I just I just want the one kick and then I need a snare that's like give me a snare I need 808 808 808 that's thick I'm going use this one sampler oh this is the same 808 I made that that mixer track for bet uh speed interest in speed use speed oo no just to go like like okay so that's cool I like this a lot so I need um some type of the cord's going to hit like on the Dow beat like this make unique and I need to no I made it oh wait that's fine that's not a big deal okay let's think let's use Surge and I'm going to pick some type of cords that are like Keys artificial okay um let could be interesting uh let's use that sure just got to hurry up hurry up H up hurry up don't have I don't I have zero clue on how much time I have right now zero clue I'm just going to go like this and then I want it to just be like that it's so loud I need to add like a I don't want to add a eliminer to my master let me just turn it down okay there should be absolutely zero delay on this and then there needs to be zero Reverb on this too and then I also need this to have like no release Turn Up oh that's needs a little bit more decay okay I need some type of lead on top of here that's like something um I don't really have anything I don't think maybe like a do I have a preset maybe that sounds good oh that's pretty cool yeah perfect come on fast speed no this needs like w it's just so bad okay for okay so so far we have a fairly boring is like okay so we have like an intro I can imagine a vocal here I don't actually normally make hiphop so this is like really interesting I actually don't know what to do after this like I could try to make a drop um but I started at 140 BPM so it's like weird like can't do house um let's see I really want to look at my timer but I know I'm not supposed to okay I guess I could okay I'm going to take a second to just sit back and like think about this while I listen to it I think a vocal would really help me right now come up with ideas I usually what I do is I'll have like kind of like a base idea like this send it to a vocalist and then as soon as I get it back I like have a billion ideas this it's without a vocal it's hard sometimes to think about like what to do next um also I think the timer definitely makes me it's harder to focus on like just like ideas and stuff because you're like you don't want to waste time um since this is so unique in a way I don't really know how the arrangement is supposed to go I mean I guess I could strip it down even more in the beginning I could like move this forward just have this do something like that and then you could literally just fade it in over time that's clean you know you know it is um okay so I got that would also kind of sound cool here the chords okay so sometimes this is a great uh a great point to sometimes you need to know when to let your ideas die cuz those chords are too low pitched I knew they were I tried eqing them out but you just notice that they just weren't fitting in the mix and if something's not fitting you just need to cut it uh that just needs to be cut I should have done that a long time ago so let me listen to this again this is a boring sound I need to change it uh but instead of changing it what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy it paste it mute it so I'm just going to clone it copy it paste it mute it and then I'm going to go to this and then I can change this without changing what I had before so yeah n n I could even turn back on this um so my initial idea was that I was going to be like I should do this on piano because if I show you guys on piano maybe it would make more sense like what my initial idea was so what I really wanted to do was I wanted to have it be like uh let me sh for you by getting the melody as well here um so like my idea was it was going to be like and then it would be like like not like that like it's going to be like let see maybe Maybe not maybe not it's fine I like the I like the kind of drops where like it has cords and a lead but they're not going at the same time they're kind of like bouncing back and forth that could be cool um I could look at my time and then just call it or I could keep going and if I keep going I'm trying to figure out what I do because I can mess around with different Keys that's just way to low though now so if I go sounds really cool for like the first hit but then these these notes are too low so I need to go back up to be real with you a sharp is a bit too low I don't like to go below D sharp so yeah D is kind of lowest I like to go with my with my base dsh D that's usually the lowest you can go without it sounding like weird in the sub area I don't know why it's just that is always like that um I don't know I don't know I think it's good it's all right um let's see the timer 13 minutes I'm just going to stop it I'm going to stop it right there and you know what we'll say that that was a temp that was attempt two got get back to my Apple CIO here okay so let's talk about this for a second so um what I did was I I love doing this little intro thing so what I do is I take fic involver and I will put on my master and put it to the pink noise preset okay and then what that does is essentially like if you listen it blows everything out like in terms of the and it just creates this really warm like I could honestly I could even do this like this would probably make it sound really good yeah like this this right here yeah yeah yeah like something like this would be perfect so you just kind of take these two boom and it gives you like a hint of the future like song of like what it's going to be but it doesn't quite give it away yet cuz it's like all reverbed out so you can't really tell um I like starting in with the Basse and the drums and immediately off the start you want to hook in your listener another way we could hook in The Listener here is from the started here we could have a a reverse that kind of goes into it so um if I had like some type of uh what's it called sweep uplifter perfect just something like this very simple see how much of a big difference that makes just uh every eight bars you want to add something new this is constant so honestly if I really want to make this interesting I can probably take these vocal things for right now and then just leave it like this oh vocal thing and I think they sound cool I also speed up the base here um that's just to kind of give a little bit more movement cuz you don't want to ever stay like stagnant so like I can make this super boring like I just keep this the same too and then I like didn't do anything new in this part other than maybe add the chords like it's fine but this it just picks it up a notch I think that this is huge um and then obviously when I get into this part this is just a huge producer life hack if you just take out all the volume right before the the drop it makes it hit just that much harder so I think that's that's cool um I want to add in some saturation so I didn't really add any saturation to this that's like a million times better already I can't believe I didn't do that before um so yeah saturation to your uh subbase it just adds those extra harmonic so like we go into the sub face right here and for those of you saying that I my uh my subbase is wide uh it is not actually I'm using Bas Lane and what this does is it widens certain bands of frequencies over other bands so I'm actually widening 500 htz right here on my sub which is like really interesting because it means that the subfrequencies are going to stay low so like I could literally take a midside EQ here like if I go to Patcher and I go to uh midside uh I made this preset and I'll just straight up give you the uh guys this for free uh this is so helpful and I want you guys to have it um it so basically like that's without the wide hear the difference and then I can literally take out the the lows and the highs and it literally will sound no different because interesting huh I guess this 808 has a little bit of width in the bottom that's fine uh it still sounds good so I'm not going to fuss over it too much I mean if you really were worried about the 808 sounding wi in the bottom I guess you could always put it mon it still hits that's fine uh so yeah I like I like the way that that sounds so uh I also really like using that in general just so I could put like a Patcher here with my midside EQ preset and if you do this um like I don't know why I need to resave this preset where the stereo is on the bottom uh basically it splits the bands into a midside EQ basically means that you can take the the frequencies that are in mono and mix them separately from the side frequencies so that's what this bar is right here so when I turn this wide it makes things get wider and when I put it this way it makes this mono so the reason I have it like that is so that I can mix these separately so like listen boring way more interesting because I'm boosting the highs and that just kind of like tingles your ears okay so I would side chain the Basse but I've noticed for a lot of hiphop producers they actually don't side chain the Basse in the kick and for some reason it makes it distort when the kick hits the base and it sounds actually cooler uh so like if I were to side chain this it would just kind of lack that kind of uh messy energy like where it just like everything's just kind of hitting into each other like that sounds cool for hipop so I've kind of noticed this is kind of a thing to do if I take that and then I might just oh that's the vocal what am I doing where's the I might add it like a transpire on this and then just boost add a little bit of saturation oh that's on the wrong thing so funny that's fine I actually never put these on mixture tracks that's crazy let's put that on the mixure track here we go um okay it's funny because I'm doing like this one hour challenge but I literally like just woke up I'm just going right into it right in the morning uh I usually produce like really late at night I would like to hear when you guys like to produce I I made some of my best tracks at like 400 a.m. in the morning it's hilarious obviously it's not good for your sleep but I mean yeah um okay so what else can we can we talk about about this so uh we talked about the progression and how we just want to kind of increase energy over time but also keep the listener engaged you want to change things uh eight bars uh like keep something changing all the way through uh I think some other things that intermediate producers I notic struggle with is that yeah with one thing is keeping things interesting um hooking The Listener right away uh not having to keep everything all the time so I don't actually need this melody playing the whole time I could actually take this out like and this would actually be really good because what I can do is I could have a singer on here and they could be like singing here and just doing their thing just have the melody coming in that beginning part and then just have the singer come in here I can't sing but if I would sing it would yeah it probably wouldn't sound good so uh let's see and then you bring in the melody here and then you're like okay that leads you into it and then I could completely change the melody here too like just for for instance like we could literally just change the whole thing right here could be fun let's just try never mind we're not going to change uh okay so another thing is that be cognizant of What BPM you're in in what kind of stuff that you're making because obviously like I can't make house at 140 so like just keep it consistent in terms of like what you're trying to do I think that that's uh some people like they'll don't change to BPM during your track it's confusing for The Listener um like I would stick to like kind of one whole idea uh per track if you have like four ideas going on in a track like it's going to just confuse the listener so um I wasn't doing anything crazy here uh I started making hiphop because I was at 140 and I just stuck with it I didn't change BPM I could have I could have like maybe I could like turn it down to I don't really want to do that because I stretch everything but that's fine just leave it how it is uh I'm trying to think it's it's also harder for me to give advice with hiphop music because I don't actually make a lot of it uh I make a lot of future balance in like different uh EDM genres but I've been trying to do more hiphop because it's it's it's a lot of fun to produce um so let me let me think typically what you saw me uh mess around with these vocal samples uh don't look at something immediately and just go like no try to see like the potential and like things that you could use so you saw the vocal s pi and you're probably like e that does not fit at all but I heard something in there and I was able to pull it out to make something kind of cool so like now we have this and that adds a huge just like background element also another thing is that notice how I just because I found something cool I didn't have to use it constant l so like this crush this was like this little uh um this thing that like uh I forgot what what the term is called but it has a certain effect on the vocals that I liked but I didn't want it the whole time see it's not there and doing these kind of things where you don't do it all the time adds a lot of progression to your uh to your music so like taking out the rain sounds in in the drop here if I kept them in it's just kind of more going on if I take it out it just has that more of that drop in feel where like you're hearing a lots of sound here I could honestly I could you could even do like a fake out there there's so many potential things you could do but once you like kind of like suck everything out once it's like it's all like sustained and then like you can just take cut everything and then it hits so much harder so uh that's that's one huge thing uh one thing I didn't do which I could show you guys is if a really cool trick basically you're going to go to your master create an automation clip and then create one automation clip on on the stereo as well and then what you do is for the stereo separation you're going to put it up like just maybe like halfway and then for the volume you're going to go down like three Deb do that do that and then check this out okay that might be a little bit too much on the volume side let me one sec go like right here you don't want to do the volume too much on the master but just as the effect everything kind of goes lower and like more in in your headphones and then it like widens out last second it's super cool I love doing that so that's another cool trick that you guys can do um let's see for 1 hour challenge or I guess like a 50 minute 45 minute I mean I didn't really I wasn't really producing the last 5 minutes I was kind of just thinking uh I guess yeah uh don't be afraid to use Loops right here I just wanted to save time and it was a cool idea and it sounded nice so I just kept it in there it's not a big deal um using Loops can just give you a lot of creativity and freedom free up the mind to do other ideas um let's see here I have like AAR major I could add in like other stuff so like let's find another sample that sounds cool with this so I go back to adsr sample manager and I'm just going to repeat this part right here and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go only on loops and I'm only going to search up a major samples and just literally play them with the song and this can lead to all kinds of ideas H this sounds interesting I know it doesn't fit in how it is but I think like if I like let me show you an example something so like let's say I have some a sample that doesn't quite fit and you can do things to make it fit sometimes so like I can take out so like maybe that doesn't work but maybe I can like take this and like pitch it up never know just do something like that maybe not I I always like to check so sometimes I'll just throw samples in there and like sometimes you get lucky and you're like oh wow that sounded like perfect and then you can just keep it as like a background element or just like uh just something for uh one half of the arrangement so um don't uh if you ever are like looking for new ideas and you're just like I'm stuck at this like try throwing in a sample or two and just see like if it spark some idea and even if you don't use the sample you can always use it to make something else that's similar or like that you think would lead to a cooler idea so uh that's like another cool trick I'm trying to like I think one huge thing for uh moving from the kind of beginner intermediate to Advanced stages is that you need uh need to feel more comfortable working faster so you probably saw in this my workflow was 10 times faster than my beginner tutorial and that's because I wasn't limited by having to explain every single thing I did I'm just kind of assuming that you guys already know what you're doing so I could just zoom through all this like like just click through everything and even though I'm going quickly if you watch How I go quickly then you are able to probably copy me later and then that'll help you guys improve as well so uh I'm trying a different method of uh just basically teaching a lesson here because uh the first way I did it in the beginner of tutorial I thought was helpful if you'd never produced before but if you are producing I think trying to think about the things that you don't know like there's a lot of things that you just don't know and uh basically how it was for me is I look up tutorials and I try to find things that they could inform me on that I didn't already know but a lot of times they were just telling me how to do something rather than telling me the why behind it and so I like like explaining the reasons of why I do things rather than giving you like a technical explanation a lot of times because that'll be more beneficial to you in the long run so let me give you a good example of this I could like one technical thing I told you guys was about the involver trick and that's practical you could use that in your own um but it doesn't tell you why I did I did this and if I explain why I did it if I if I say okay I want to give contrast from the inro of the song and then draw the listener's ear in right as the song starts so that it starts off on the beat like immediately so I have no kicks no drums going on here and then immediately that's going to draw The Listener in okay in the first five seconds of the song uh it's the same idea here where I take out everything this part and then this beginning part are the same thing they're the same concept uh and doing it right before the transition from the bridge the chorus and from the I mean not the bridge my bad um the buildups to the chorus and the intro to or I guess the starting intro to the intro gives that same effect of the the why behind it would be I want to uh create a not necessarily a surprise but something that catches the the listener's ear immediately so that's something to think about so I think that that that's the reason I like doing this convolver trip for instance another way I could help you guys with like a technical thing balance with the reason for why I do it is uh I think I explained that with the with the crush technique is that I didn't we're not just I'm not teaching you just oh use Crush it's cool fore plugin and if you do this effect it's cool uh basically I was like okay well once you find something cool um I didn't want to do it all the time because it doesn't keep the song interesting so keeping the song flowing and moving so that the listener wants to keep listening uh you want to add change throughout your song So if I just kept this the same the whole time it would just sound it wouldn't be bad it just would be less interesting so if I mean if I just keep it on I mean it doesn't the weird thing is that there's a lot of things in music that don't sound bad so you can leave them like that but then until you do something different that sounds better then you're like oh that sounds even better and that's why uh I highly recommend that you guys collaborate with artists find people your skill level and then just ask them you have to kind of just take a leap and just be like hey man you want to make you want to make a song and then just do that and I think that that would be it would be so helpful for you guys I remember I just join a bunch of discords and I'd literally just sit in a Discord with like five people and we'd all make music like dead silent while we're making music and then we'd like DM each other later like hey you want to make a song and then that's that's literally like how I learned how to make music I think it's one of the best ways too because you're matching people with your skill level and then working with them uh will help you all improve um as you keep practicing together uh and then what you want to do is just keep making friends with better and better producers and then just keep working up and building your skills and slowly by slowly you'll meet uh like people that are a little bit better than you that maybe have already released on a label and they'll want to uh be with you I mean if you're just a nice person and you're fun to hang out with um it's really easy to make friends with uh good producers and just uh learning and get better so I think one super underrated tip where like you might go on YouTube and you might look up for like tutorials on how to become a better producer and they might give you all these mixing techniques and I did I I told you about Patcher and midside Q is massive it's so helpful but it's not going to turn you into professional just knowing midside of Q what will really turn you into professional is making connections with artists that are uh bigger than you and just uh having having your name out there a little bit more and just knowing people um and I mean if that if that's your goal that's that's really the what you want to do um there was this really good artist and he gave me advice he basically told me he said the difference between um a good producer and a great producer has uh how did he put it he didn't say he basically said um it doesn't have to do with technical ability or anything he said I've seen uh good artists that are way more technically better than professional artists I've seen professional artists that are vice versa you know um but his his point was is that it's not necessarily about the technical ability but also the knowledge and the skills of uh being an artist are different than just technical ability so knowing music theory doesn't make you a professional artist uh knowing the whole all of FO Studio doesn't make you a professional artist and so that's why I would say that I I am a professional music producer but I wouldn't say I'm a professional artists um there's a big difference because I I just haven't released music so I can't really be considered a professional artist even though I've made hundreds and hundreds of songs and I made songs for clients and I've done all that I I wouldn't be technically considered a professional musician simply because I don't have professionally released Songs so I would really like to do that um but obviously just haven't figured out exactly what Nisha I want to uh start in and what kind of music I want to make I mean even you saw even this one hour challenge I wasn't really sure what I was making it like turned into hiphop but I don't really like to make hiphop all that often so um I digress uh so just trying to think of more Advanced Techniques uh in the last uh attempt of this this is attempt two in the last attempt what I did was I actually used Edison to record a sound desize session so like let me let me show you what I mean I'll literally stick Edison on my master here uh actually let's save this and just go out of the file I think that I pretty much showed also happy accidents by Ross moment when I accidentally hit my keyboard and made that cool snare that was so cool I'm like so happy I did that that was like such an awesome I'm going to do that my other tracks I didn't even know that that could sound that cool is this just on c yeah it literally is it's just one octave below so if I put these on the same yeah that's so cool that's hilarious um okay so let's go into a new template I just want to show you guys some stuff so this that was kind of like my reflection on the one hour challenge uh I also just want to show you guys other Advanced Techniques that I think would be really helpful to you so I think I'm not sure what you guys are necessarily expecting I know I've been getting emails almost every day asking me to do a second course and um if I systematically went through every Advanced technique in FL Studio we'd probably be here for like about a year because there are so many different things that I could go through and all of them are important so I'm trying to give you guys the tools that will enable you like uh so instead of giving you fish I want to teach you how to fish obviously so I want to teach you the methods that I use to become a good Producer instead of just telling you facts or telling you stuff that is helpful but you're probably not going to remember because this is a long tutorial it's going to be like probably over an hour and so I want to give you a ways of becoming better that way you can become better artist on your own instead of uh watching tons of tutorials and then forgetting everything and that and still being the same level producer which definitely happens um so I don't want to trick you guys with tutorials I want to help you improve so one thing that could help you improve is by simply just going on your master sticking an Edison on there that's aor not fector it's a cool plugin but not what I was looking for Edison just going to hit record and I'm literally just going to go to vital and then as soon as you just start messing around you're recording in here so I can literally just find some like same so we got like so as you can see I like just was messing around for a second and then uh where am I I need this so you can take this right and I can actually drag and drop this immediately by clicking this button right here and into the playlist and I could take something like this right I could copy that I like that I could literally copy and make this use a unique sample save this it's going to go into uh my backup and then I can go to tww samples I go to where is it my samples render and then this is called September 13th Part One blah blah blah I could just call this du du du and then I could save it and then I could go back to our project file that we just in and then I could literally just pull let me show you guys an example because that that was what an AAR major and I just did that in C major so need to go one two steps down and then whole octop okay that so I have this right here I'll just literally go to my samples my samples just refresh it du okay so I just need to pitch it down twice go up once stretch maybe like stretch it so it fits in like I have no idea like just it doesn't really sound that good but uh just for instance you could see how this could be cool like where you just have a recording where you could just go in Edison sound design cut a small part of it and then use that in your tracks so you never really know what you'll get like just messing around and a lot of times you miss it like you're like oh that sound is so cool and then you like don't have it every time your sound design it just hit Edison and you'll literally never miss any of those moments and then what you can do is you can have a folder like this where you just save all of those recordings of your Edison sound design and then you'll have all of those as your own library of samples and I started doing this my computer unfortunately crashed so like I obviously I didn't make this Advanced tutorial for another eight months so the reason being for that was for a lot of reasons one my computer completely failed I lost everything and I like restart from scratch and then that was like really difficult um the second thing was more of a personal uh thing with a relationship so like I was I was like really down so I just was not in the mental state to like make another thing so I was tough and then so after I got I kind of refixed my computer got a new laptop got a new setup obviously well you can't see because I'm doing a green screen but I'm in a new place right now I got a new microphone I got new everything that took about like twoish months then by that time I was thinking about doing doing personal courses uh for the people in the first beginner class but I decided not to because I just wasn't sure of how much value I could provide uh the big thing with that was that I was thinking okay well if I do personal courses for you guys how much value is that really giving to and I figured okay it's actually not providing that much value because I wouldn't want to give knowing what I know now I wouldn't have wanted somebody to I wouldn't have wanted to pay somebody to give me just oneonone advice that wasn't I don't think that that would be as helpful uh what I do think would be helpful was teaching the and the reasons of why I do things for free uh and I think that's more helpful than me doing paid courses so that's why I never offered uh paid courses um that being said another reason I really couldn't do the course for so long was because uh I literally just couldn't like I needed to work I just didn't have time so the only reason I'm I'm doing this now is because I a I wanted to make a second installment because I get emails every single day and then I also I've always wanted to do music uh to some capacity as as like a career so I mean uh obviously I don't think I can do that for a while I would have to kind of establish myself a little bit more um but I am going to be releasing the FP for this completely free um and I believe yeah all the samples I used are are free so uh you can pick up all these samples for free as well and I'll just release this FP in the description and you could pick that up um if you'd also like I'm also going to leave uh under a comment I'm just going to have uh just my my YouTube channel and I'm also going to have uh like hopefully some type of website by time this course is out or some link uh to like a pack which you could use to to help me and also help your Productions as well just improve uh what you're making cuz I know it could be hard to find samples out there it can be hard uh so I'll probably have samples and presets I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do for that by the time this course is out but I'll have something something available and then also something for free for you guys so if You' like to support me in that way hopefully I can make you guys more tutorials and I'd love to start making more tutorials on my channel as well um I don't know how much I have to add to this uh I was going to do this in collaboration with another artist and uh he was going to do vocals so what I might do is if this tutorial keeps going then that means that he's collaborating with me and if he's collaborating with me then maybe I could do a second part of this tutorial where we have the vocals on top and we try to finish the track together and in that case I'll get back to you guys and maybe I'll do a part two and maybe we'll just keep this as a shorter version of the tutorial and just see how it goes so with that being said thanks so much for your guys support I'm glad that these tutorials are helping and I know this is a little bit different format and maybe a little less of what you were expecting uh in terms of the last tutorial I did was a lot more methodical this didn't really have chapters it was more of just off the cuff like okay let's make this Challenge and then let's explain what I was doing uh so I hope you found value in this as well I know it's a bit different um but thanks for watching guys and uh I'll see you soon all right we're here in the actual project after the 1 hour challenge and now I'm going to show you guys what this looks like so to me I uh it was not loading some some of the things which is unfortunate but I'm going just going to play it the way it is and we'll try to go through as much as we can so a lot of this stuff looks exactly the same as my 1 hour challenge obviously I absolutely love what he did here it looks so awesome that he like uh color coordinated everything I love that um props I thank you blend a base uh so we got and I feel like I can skip a lot of this because it's just the same as winner challenge uh let's go to the to the part that he did stuff with obviously this is not sound very good I'm not sure why it's not loading some of the plugins right so it's not going to sound very nice but so you can see he actually chopped up uh both the samples here and just made some interesting uh rhythmic and Pitch patterns to change it up here the funny thing is when I first uh saw him doing this I'm like this is kind of hard to follow and then after now I'm like completely vibing with it and it's awesome and I was wrong again all uh then he did this super cool thing where he he sampled and then used the channel pitch or the sample to make this one of the coolest things I've I've heard I don't know this is so cool to me that is such a that that is that is swag that's like the way that that comes into this bar that is so cool as soon as I heard him do that I was like okay that's sick um but yeah it's just uh changing the pitch of and he used the song to sample itself and then yeah it's very very creative um right here we have a really cool uh chord preset and it's kind of playing with everything else I really wanted to use a drop and make something with this I just never got the the chance to since the project wasn't working in my favor unfortunately but uh let's go so he I like how he also moves down further and further uh so not everything's on the same level it's kind of interesting uh let's go here see what he did here in the front scene to the and you so we see the way that he did his voice was super interesting so he actually used his voice as a instrument uh and the instrument isn't loing for me but he actually used his voice and then uh he forgot I forgot the way that he explained it but it's so interesting he actually essentially used it as a sample and then uh played chords with it uh under his own voice this is very so you can hear that playing over and over again that's his voice and then he has going oh the chords are working so yeah this is his voice you can hear it it's like playing his AC C capella and that's him saying it always on the run Horizons behind me looking at the dashboard fast FL D so you can see that we keep the vocals mostly mono and we have different uh different vocal layers going to different vocal buses and then eqing those uh separately is the way that he did it which is the same way that I do my vocals as well uh and then you can just apply effects those different um side pan vocals and the ones that are in the center and obviously the ones that make up the chords so that you can have a a very cohesive vocal so it's not just a a vocal is almost never just one take it's usually like uh 10 different takes and then uh doing slightly different things with each one of those to complement the whole so that's usually the way that uh vocals are done so you should never expect to just like record vocals into a mic and then just be like good for your song like that almost never happens I usually tons of vocal samples and that's how that works I think I accidentally changed some of this a way I was like messing around earlier that's pretty funny this part is so cool I love how it like drops out into this giant opens up into this like rebb area where like it just uh kind of expands the song and then it there's no rhythmic element going on so it's just kind of floaty and then it turns into a buildup which I thought was one of the most creative ways to go from an like an ambient track from hipop and then into like a buildup it just shows like uh when you collab with people you're going to come up with ideas that are like greater than some of the parts because I know for a fact like when I sent him this track he doesn't make stuff like this so like the stuff that he's going to make out of it is going to be super interesting um and just be different so it's it's really it's really cool and fun to collab and that's another reason why you should join the and then he as you can hear that this riter is slowly getting louder in my opinion in my opinion this is is my opinion I think that that it probably should have hit here it just goes for a little bit extra and I think that lose a little bit of energy that's just my thoughts but overall still really dope still really and then he completely made this part this wasn't me at all he's just like I want to make this part I'm like all go for it and then he did it was it was super sick uh and I've never heard him make this type of house music before really interesting we usually make like future balance or something this is this is super cool uh but yeah and then obviously he has the lead playing in the background I'm trying to figure out where the lead is is it this no it's a high hat it must be this right I am not seeing the lead I might just be blind but anyways very cool um I don't have a ton to add as I said the project didn't totally load for me so it's a little bit unfortunate but um yeah this is this is the project uh if you were curious and seeing a little bit like what it looks like this is what it ended up turning out like um this was going to be actually the whole uh Advanced tutorial I was going to go over this entire track uh after the 1 hour challenge so I just wanted to do a shorter version of that since this is already getting pretty long with the other uh version of the course that I did and I have recorded many versions of this course but hopefully you liked this version and without further Ado I hope that you are able to create your own songs out of this and that this was helpful uh into improving your Productions in the future so without further Ado I'll see you later and you can uh see if you want to see more of me I'm going to be making YouTube videos I'll see you there bye one of the last things I wanted to go over was one of the most Advanced Techniques I think uh that I can teach you and it's so something so funny because a lot of people learned this really early and some people don't learn it for a very long time for some reason uh and it's not really that complicated and some people might laugh and be like oh it's so simple like either why didn't I think of that before or why are you just telling them this now like this is not like an advanced tip but it will help you become an advanced producer and that's simply using reference tracks uh this is so important so I used uh I I can't play this song because it'll get copyrighted but I used this as uh there was an advertising agency that wanted me to make a song similar to this so I uh took the song and I re pretty much remade it and just change the Melodies and instruments to make my own version of it with kind of the same energy uh so this was the initial track uh I was able to use an AI to split the vocals from the instrumental and then I had the instrumental in my track and tried to make something really similar so you guys can listen to this song on your own time and then come back here and listen to what this sounds like in comparison to the original track e the funny thing about this is I also made this in like an hour like an hour and a half and I had to make it really quickly because of deadlines and so deadlines are could be a huge motivator for making things really quickly and uh this is just one example of how I had a reference track and how I was able to use that to try to copy and make something similar to that and then do my own take on it so I use the arrangement as inspiration I use the type of instruments they were using as inspiration and ultimately it can help you uh expand your music production what is it like repertoire because uh by trying to figure out how other artists did things it will help you realize things that you've never tried before and uh open you up to new ways of making things so for instance something like this guitar section I had never made anything like this before and I thought it sounded really interesting like I do not make guitar patterns usually like this so this was the inspiration so I just thought it turned out pretty interesting so uh and it really fit the track so stuff like that and then I never used to make guitar Melodies that kind of would like this all of it was really interesting and a learning experience for me and while I don't really make this type of music and I'm not super like impressed by like the final result I'm like it's all right it's like not something I release or work on really any longer um but I know that it's something that that um that they were looking for so this is something that they wanted not something that I wanted so I was uh making it for a different reason there but uh yeah use reference tracks and try to make make it as close to as you can uh and just kind of it'll help you fix uh learn how to make your mixes better because you'll be listening to professionals and their mixes and how to make your instrumentals and so that's uh one huge tip is just using reference tracks and then following and using their Arrangement as a uh inspiration for your own arrangement for your track uh and that can help you and save you so much time because if you don't know how to arrange your music because you're not listening to music that other people are listening to then your music is going to be chaotic and it's be hard to follow and yeah it'll just be difficult and you might think oh I don't want like any limitations I don't want anything to stunt my creativity it's like your creativity only works if you have limitations first to break you can't go outside of a box if there is no box so that's why reference tracks are so helpful because they give you something that you can work off of and be creative with so hopefully that that was helpful and I just wanted to quickly show this um and I don't know how much more I have to show you guys uh I really thought I went over a lot for this Advanced tutorial and I know it's not as comprehensive and maybe some people wanted um so maybe I just go a kind of speed through all the tips before we go out basically every tip that comes to my mind I'm this is going to be like a supercharged tip section where I just zoom through a million tips that I can think of uh and then we'll close it out the last thing that I'd like to say is that I do have a website with my sing pack and I think that this would be super helpful for you guys and the reason that uh I'm even offering the SLE pack and I think that would be useful for to you guys is because I am updating it um every time I make some new music or I make uh something I'm adding uh different things that I've made to that sample pack for free so as you buy it you can always go back and download the new samples I add so so there's almost no sample packs that do that where you just buy it and there's always new samples for you every time you open it up that's super cool I think so uh I just want to let you guys know that's Tristan wil cox. us with twls and then I also off all my patreon I offer personal courses uh oneonone and I give you feedback at different uh tiers you can see that whatever works for you to help support uh support me and then I also make YouTube videos for free so uh you guys can see my Productions on my own music and hopefully I can share uh some knowledge and just help you guys grow in your music producer Journey so without further ado we are going to zoom through all the tips starting now so one thing that you can do is if you have sample packs I would go through all your samples and make one Consolidated uh sample pack with all your favorite samples out of different sample packs you use rather than having hundreds of sample packs in your browser so that's something that I did and this is what I came up with I had drums extra sample packs effects uh yeah so this got kind of messy pretty quickly but essentially you'll have all the folders full of things that you have so I have drum and this says buildup Loop claps fills drum loops and then you can see that these come from all sorts of different sample packs I've downloaded in the past and samples that I've made and so what this does is effectively consolidates all your sample packs uh into one sample pack rather than having to go through a million sample packs to find the ones that you want uh so this is I think very helpful um another thing that you can do is just save literally everything save your projects save your fops export your fops name your FPS and your exported of the FP the same thing so that if I search for the FP I can find the exported file in case that FP gets corrupted save your work see where you've been I have not saved a lot of my work and that's why I lost a lot of my work so just something that I want to know uh so you always want to be saving your stuff always want to be making backups of your stuff uh something that you can do is if you have any preset you can save your presets go here go file go save as preset and then save that and then once you save that name it the same thing uh so whatever I name it here name that the same thing that you save it's it's a mixer chain as well so whatever the mixer chain is called you want to save those as the same name so when you open up both you can up both of those together uh something cool that you can always mess around with is that if you're in the piano roll you can always go to this down arrow key go to view go to scale highlighting and you can put it on automatic and it will help you highlight different uh parts of the scale that you're looking for or you can change it to the scale of the reference track that you're working on or you can just make it some interesting scale and just mess around with that and see what kind of uh creative ideas and Melodies that helps you come up with something I would really recommend uh is that when you you are uh editing your notes you want allow resizing from left to be enabled this is super annoying when it's off so I highly recommend that you have that enabled if you want uh a window on one of your syns to be open make sure that you on this arrow you click detached and it will stay open as you're working uh and that's really helpful for like if I want to be sound designing this and changing notes I can't do both at the same time unless this window is detached okay so that just means that this changing things here doesn't affect this window uh and then if I want to un attach this you'll see what happens if I change something here it'll disappear that window so that you can fully Focus so that's just another thing if you are afraid of making a change in your track and you don't want it to affect uh your overall production you can go to file you can go to save as new version and what that will do is it will essentially make the a copy of that flp as a new version so you can make any changes that you want and still have your old version of the flp without changing anything there um something that you can do is that if uh you have some there's this weird automation glitch that happens uh but sometimes you need uh you'll have a mixer track uh that looks like this where um it just no matter what you do it's always stuck at zero what you want to do to fix this is turn this mixture track all the way up right click it and then go initiate song with this position once you do that it will reset that one uh if it's still not working uh you can always reset the entire uh preset by or reset the entire mixer Chain by clicking reset select trct the default if you want to save and copy effects from one mixture chain to another what you can do is you can right click and you can go to file and you go to save mixure track St as if you click and hold and drag you can drag that to any other mixer chain and unlet go on that and will copy everything about that to the new mixer chain that is so cool to me that you can do that um another thing that you can do is that if you'd like to make a slightly different um uh lead like variant is that like let's say I have a first drop and then I have a second drop and I want to make a different lead but it still fits in my track I can actually just right click on this and click clone and it will duplicate uh that preset and then I can make slight differences in that preset so that I have two different uh things that are but both similar in style if that makes sense so hopefully that wasn't too complicated um what's another thing uh let's think I'm running out steam I I was like I was on a roll with with with those tips let's see if I can uh think of anymore um if you have uh this uh magnet on on different things it can really screw you up so I have mine on cell and that's what it's selected on so when I move things around it always clicks to the nearest cell if I had this on none it would just slide kind of all around and be very unpredictable so I have it on cell that way when I click it um it properly uh aligns to the grid the way you would imagine it would um something that you can do is that if I left click and hold alt I can I can uh I can uh play patterns in the track and then you can also do this on a different level inside inside the piano roll without playing through the entire thing so if you just want to hear what this chord sounds like at the end without having to play the hold pattern over again alt right click and you can drag through to see what that sounds like um one thing uh another tip that I have which I shared in the very beginning of the course is any knob that you see in a third party Plugin or in a normal plugin you can click and you can automate if you go here and I Chang something I can go to what I changed up here right click it and go create automation clip and it will literally create an automation clip for whatever I just moved last um as you can see that create an automation clip for that five band frequency and that's how you can make automations for literally anything that you change in the entire uh in the entire uh program um other things that I can recommend uh in the sampler uh if you want to uh play like an instrument uh you can't just do it by dragging and dropping the sample in here what you'd actually have to do is go to your channel Rack open up something called the sampler here and once you open up that sampler and drag and drop a sample onto that let's say actually I need actually like a one shot and then I need to be like a synth and then I'll drop that sampler into the sample and that will give you the envelope tool which you can use to to change the envelope of your sound and then I use the cross bait and this will allow you to sustain whatever instrument that you're playing over time so if I put the cross bait all the way up you can hear it's like still playing a little bit which is really cool um another thing that you can do is that if you want it to slide you can go to this wrench tool click mono click up and then uh Max and then you can do one is what I like to do and then you can have it uh bending like crazy like I showed you in the beginning of the sound design course so that's how you do that in the sampler um something that you can do is if this range for pitch isn't enough you can just increase the range to 12 uh that'll make it go up octave up or an octave down and then you can automate the pitch of that accordingly because you cannot as far as I know automate this pitch right here so that's just a quick tip right there also did you know that the volume here and the volume in here in the channel rack are exactly the same so you can see this thing changing with this those are the same thing FYI um trying to think of anything else that I can think of if you take hold on the sample you can also drag and then drop it in the in the uh playlist as as well so those are kind of they work together as well in that way um if I have a pattern that has multiple things going on in it I can split it so like let's say I have this chord progression and it is in this melody here and I go like here and I paste those chords and I have these kind of on top of each other I can go to this pattern I can right click the pattern and click split by Channel and then will pull out that and then give me the guitar and that chord separately in two different patterns so you can use that for arranging um and doing that um another cool thing that you can do is in the top left corner of this it gives you tons of settings for the sampler uh for samples and for uh your uh patterns so for instance I can click chop and I can go uh different things so I can do like beat Shuffle and it will like completely change the way this go and that completely changed the melody because it chopped it up and the same thing happens uh with loot base samples too so if I go to Loop and I go to like actually let me just show you guys an example by literally muting everything except for this and then going to my own sample pack and this will just be a little plug because I'll show you one of the cooler samples in my pack so we'll go to loops and go to other you can't tell me this doesn't sound sick it's so funny like I like I make stuff like this and then like you guys see me like when I'm working and trying to show you guys how to music produce and I like make like the most garbage stuff but then like when I'm alone like sitting it's like raining outside I'm like making like music like this is so funny it just depends on like the mood I'm in and like different things to be it can highly affect the way also how much water you drink and what snacks you have with you will affect different types of music that you're making cool facts okay so uh top left corner here I can go to here and there's all sorts uh types of settings like if I want to make another sample that's um high pitched and the other one low pitched but I want them to play at the same time I could go to click this make unique a sample and this uh will not affect what I changed here will not affect this so I can have a play at the same time and then I could select both of them at the same time and I could actually make changes to both of them simultaneously so then I could uh have um CH I could chop it both the same way and then I could like do something like this [Laughter] and that for some reason sounds very cool so I might use that in some type of track on day but uh yeah you could use that that chop function and that was just one of the functions here there's so many different ones that you can do and I haven't even messed with all of them so apparently you can extract stems from the sample uh I haven't even tried this yet uh it's with the new FL studio21 update they just did I forgot which one but if you up I can extract stems uh this feature needs to be downloaded before it can be used download now sure let's do that that's so cool I've never used this before so like it's just exciting like you're just messing around you're just looking at different things and you can find all sorts of new stuff in Apple Studio Poss things new that they're adding so just going to download this really quick and see what it does so this is just the advanced production process just randomly seeing what happens when you click things uh and and then not being afraid to see what happens so let's do uh there's no vocals I can just pull that out and let's extract let's see what it does I'm really curious processing processing I'm so curious if this going to get all my samples out of this that would blow me away so does it just poop him out oh my goodness it does how cool is that and this is a base that is so you can't tell me that's not cool that is really cool like they just added this too okay that's another Advanced production technique extracting your s your own from things from samples how cool is that wow that is really cool I honestly I don't even think that I could show you a cool a cooler thing let's end it off like that I know e just added that I saw that and I hadn't used it until then that is so cool okay I think that's a great place to end it I've gone over a lot of stuff and I haven't even gone over over maybe like 5% of everything in this program it's insane like if I was literally to do an advanced tutorial front to back all everything I could be here for like a year like it's there's so much to do oh it's so frustrating like I just want to show you guys everything I want to I want to help you guys and I know that I can't do it all in one tutorial and that's why I want to for the last time say I making videos on my YouTube channel now uh because a lot of people have been asking me to and I'm going to help you guys we're going to do challenges I'm going to do like uh so we'll all kinds of really neat challenges uh in my Discord Community as well that um I'm hoping will add more fun and so you can find people to make music with so if you don't have any friends to make music with uh come join my Discord uh community and we're all going to make music together I'm going to do challenges I'll be there too it's not going to be one of those things where I just won't be there I will be there and I'll help you and if you're if you want to join me uh making music then just yeah join the channel join the stuff and I just want to thank uh free Cod camp for this opportunity again and I absolutely love their Channel and they helped me so much when I was in college as well so I want to return the favor by helping them uh by making a a tutorial that could help everyone else so with that being said thank you so much for joining and I hope that you gathered at least a little bit of information and remember enjoy the process and have fun producing peace
