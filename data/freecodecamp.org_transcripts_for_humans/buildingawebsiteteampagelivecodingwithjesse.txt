00:06 - hey everybody is Jessie I'm a front-end
00:09 - developer and this livestream is just
00:12 - about showing people what I do so
00:16 - whatever I happen to be working on at
00:19 - this time of day
00:20 - pretty much every day every weekday you
00:24 - guys will see I want you to see all my
00:28 - mistakes interruptions everything that
00:31 - would happen in a normal day so this is
00:33 - entirely unscripted and hopefully I'll
00:36 - give you just a little glimpse of how at
00:38 - least one front-end developer does his
00:41 - work we are in the middle of a project
00:46 - let me give you a quick recap I have
00:48 - some info in the description for this
00:51 - livestream and I also have some videos
00:55 - I've done before this of one other video
00:57 - on this channel free code camp and then
00:59 - I have some other videos on my channel
01:02 - and the link is in the description so we
01:08 - have a partially finished website that
01:12 - I'm going to take and finish but I'm
01:16 - finishing it kind of in a different
01:18 - format so the partially finished website
01:20 - was built with Drupal we're going to
01:22 - build this first it's just a static HTML
01:25 - site and then eventually we're going to
01:28 - convert that to react components and
01:30 - we're going to render that server-side
01:32 - and all the content is going to be
01:35 - pulled in from WordPress through the
01:38 - WordPress API so the react site will
01:44 - exist on a different server from the
01:46 - WordPress site and all the content will
01:50 - come from there but we'll set all that
01:52 - up and in the weeks to come for now we
01:57 - need to get this site finished and ready
01:59 - to go by Monday and the site actually
02:04 - has to launch probably by the 13th so I
02:08 - want to get it done by Monday so that we
02:10 - have at least a few days for testing and
02:13 - making
02:13 - Changez if you have any other questions
02:17 - about why we're doing this or background
02:19 - for the project just put them in the
02:21 - comments you can put them in the live
02:23 - chat too but if there's a lot of people
02:25 - in the latch at it's hard for me to keep
02:28 - track of it so if I do miss your
02:30 - question a lot of chat just put it in
02:31 - the comments and then I'll get to it
02:33 - later later on and I try to answer
02:36 - everybody that their comments if you're
02:42 - returning thanks for watching yesterday
02:43 - the response was amazing I think we have
02:46 - over 5,000 views on yesterday's video
02:48 - and in 24 hours which is which is crazy
02:52 - I live in a town that has maybe 18,000
02:55 - people at most so to get 5,000 views in
02:57 - a day on one of my videos it's just
02:59 - really great and I had so much positive
03:02 - feedback out of lots of thumbs up only
03:06 - four thumbs down which is great if you
03:12 - do thumbs down the video that's that's
03:14 - fine with me but it would be cool if you
03:16 - comment below and give me some feedback
03:18 - so I can make this stream better I think
03:22 - I mean I'm definitely welcome to
03:24 - feedback I mean if you're mean about it
03:26 - I mean that stinks but I'll I'll be able
03:29 - to handle it
03:30 - alright so enough introduction let's
03:34 - just get to it here's what we've been
03:37 - working on not a whole lot has changed
03:40 - since yesterday at least visibly a lot
03:43 - of the work that I've done has just been
03:44 - on the mobile breakpoints making sure
03:47 - the positioning is okay so PC is as I
03:50 - shrink this down everything still looks
03:52 - pretty good I added a slight border on
03:55 - the bottom here to me that it just
03:58 - looked a little bit better with that
03:59 - border I'm not I'm not entirely sold on
04:02 - it it might change let me know what you
04:04 - think but it I was just used to seeing
04:09 - this read up against the black and not
04:11 - the black straight on the white so it it
04:14 - just seemed nicer to have a little bit
04:16 - of that red there and let me show you
04:21 - this is an interior page and let me show
04:23 - you on the home page we did make some
04:24 - changes
04:27 - so you still have this and this one is
04:30 - actually growing on me I know I said
04:31 - yesterday I might change it but you will
04:33 - see I'm getting used to it and so it
04:36 - might stay and then now once we get
04:38 - smaller everything's still looking
04:40 - pretty good when we get to a certain
04:42 - point when the image and the font would
04:45 - normally squish together we actually
04:47 - just switch right back to that interior
04:49 - header so it'll look the same as the
04:52 - interior pages also if the screen is
04:57 - short it will switch back but just in
05:01 - case somebody has a really big phone and
05:03 - they're in landscape mode it's possible
05:07 - that their screen is would be wide
05:08 - enough to not hit that break point but
05:11 - still short enough so that the text
05:14 - would actually be all up here the
05:16 - tagline text and it would cover up the
05:17 - logo so that's why I did you'd see here
05:21 - in this media query this is how I did
05:24 - that I said it max with inside of media
05:26 - create 600 pixels and then a comma which
05:29 - basically acts like an or if you're
05:31 - writing a media query comma and then I
05:34 - added that max height as well so I just
05:38 - pop those in just on the few elements
05:41 - the header the nav the logo the few
05:44 - elements that needed to change you see
05:47 - where the entire hero section is just
05:49 - completely not even displayed and this
05:51 - will help us too because we won't need
05:52 - to make as many image sizes for all the
05:55 - different screen sizes before I think we
05:57 - had three or four different media
06:00 - queries so we have all these different
06:01 - image sizes now we won't have to mess
06:03 - with that for today's video what I want
06:09 - to work on is this page this team page
06:11 - and as I said this is coming from a site
06:14 - that is partially finished so let me
06:16 - show you what we have to work with in
06:17 - terms of the content that's already
06:19 - there and it's not it's going to be a
06:29 - little bit of a challenge okay so here's
06:30 - the current team page from from the site
06:37 - that's unfinished
06:39 - I haven't
06:40 - eruption so this is this is great from
06:42 - me let me check it real quick sorry
06:48 - Jesse you're active I'm really sorry
06:51 - it's all I got
06:52 - okay okay that's awesome I'm actually
06:58 - glad interruption because that's like a
07:00 - normal normal day you can't always just
07:04 - have all your time to completely focus
07:06 - on the code that was actually the head
07:09 - of the department that I'm building this
07:11 - site for so that was that was cool he's
07:15 - a super nice guy he was really
07:16 - apologetic for interrupting the
07:17 - livestream okay so let's see this team
07:22 - page so right now obviously we've
07:27 - already changed the header you know this
07:29 - this isn't going to be here I think this
07:31 - is just too much stuff at the top
07:32 - without seeing the content I'm not I'm
07:37 - not entirely thrilled about this large
07:38 - block of text I don't like the font it
07:42 - just seems kind of difficult to read
07:44 - maybe it just maybe it just needs to be
07:47 - bigger or maybe not the white on the
07:50 - dark red either way you know we're going
07:53 - to change it we're probably not even
07:54 - going to have this this block of text at
07:57 - all or you know we definitely should cut
07:59 - it down and break it up
08:00 - I'm a big fan of really just minimal
08:04 - text on pages and if you have some
08:07 - interior pages that people expect have a
08:10 - lot of text like a blog post people
08:13 - expect to read that's fine but on a page
08:16 - like this I don't think anybody would
08:18 - expect to click on teams and the first
08:19 - thing they get is a very large paragraph
08:22 - what they're expecting is you know
08:24 - probably this and their BIOS for the
08:27 - people who are on the team this is
08:30 - actually the person that just
08:33 - interrupted the last shame accidentally
08:36 - so I'm Adam he's what a nice is sketchy
08:39 - over me so right now they have this this
08:44 - kind of accordion there's a couple of
08:47 - problems it's not it's not that easy for
08:50 - the people that are in charge of the
08:52 - content they don't have any experience
08:54 - is with code and they're not going to
08:56 - and that's fine but they need a way to
08:59 - edit this easily and right now this
09:01 - entire section here which goes on for a
09:04 - while is all one big kind of WYSIWYG
09:08 - section so in the the admin panel and
09:12 - Drupal you know they literally had to
09:15 - type out all of this and try to position
09:16 - the images and it's hard enough to do
09:20 - that if you know code you know let alone
09:23 - if you're just trying to put this you
09:26 - know put this in with with little
09:27 - background I'm going to check the
09:29 - lighter so I can see if I need any
09:32 - answer anything yeah these will all be
09:37 - available afterwards so somebody just
09:41 - asked if if these will be available yeah
09:43 - they are so the some of my previous ones
09:46 - are available in my youtube channel and
09:48 - that's linked in the description and
09:49 - then yesterday I just started streaming
09:51 - on free code camp so yesterday's is
09:53 - available there so between the two
09:55 - channels you'll be able to get
09:57 - everything and if you have any other
09:58 - questions just let me know in the
09:59 - comments and I'll be happy to answer
10:01 - them I'd like to do some shorter videos
10:03 - that are pre-recorded and just kind of
10:05 - explaining things in more depth and in
10:09 - this format it's like oh you're welcome
10:11 - and this format it's just kind of I
10:14 - don't think it's the best format for
10:16 - teaching I don't want to mislead anybody
10:19 - by forgetting something or leaving it
10:21 - out so I really like to take time to
10:23 - kind of prepare and do a nice video edit
10:25 - everything so if you know this would be
10:28 - more of the teaching videos I'm sure
10:30 - that and I hope that you'll learn
10:32 - something with with the live streams but
10:34 - this is just more kind of a glimpse into
10:36 - my my day okay so the one problem with
10:42 - this is the fact that it's not easy to
10:44 - edit for the people that need to be to
10:47 - update this content the second thing is
10:51 - the the formatting is just not really
10:54 - and this is it's just not you can see
11:01 - it's it's not uniform okay we have all
11:03 - the image sizes or all different sizes
11:05 - some of them are aligned differently
11:08 - there's a lot going on not only that
11:10 - there's there's some just weird issues
11:12 - when you click this you'll wind up in
11:16 - the middle so I think I want to get away
11:17 - from I want to get away from the
11:20 - accordion I'm still thinking about maybe
11:22 - some sort of accordion for mobile just
11:24 - to cut down on the amount of scrolling
11:26 - that somebody would have to do on a
11:27 - phone but there's a lot of little BIOS
11:34 - here in pictures a lot so we need some
11:37 - way to be able to display these that's
11:41 - that's not going to seem really
11:42 - cluttered so here's my idea I was going
11:45 - a little bit of sketching earlier and
11:48 - was actually as to the meeting so if you
11:51 - guys are work for a company or something
11:53 - you have frequent meetings always bring
11:55 - a sketch pad or something because you
11:57 - get ideas and and I got some ideas for
11:59 - this in the middle of meeting and I
12:00 - sketched it out so you're obviously not
12:02 - going to be able to see my sketch I
12:03 - probably should have taken a picture of
12:05 - it first to show you but I'll just
12:07 - explain it what I'm kind of thinking is
12:09 - maybe some horizontal like material type
12:15 - design style cards actually I can't show
12:17 - you an example I'm using the
12:19 - materialized framework it's kind of like
12:22 - you know bootstrap or foundation but
12:24 - with a material design you'll kind of
12:28 - build into it so let me show you how
12:30 - they do their horizontal cars and this
12:34 - is kind of a newer thing when I first
12:35 - started using materialized they didn't
12:37 - have horizontal cards actually had to
12:39 - get a kind of adjust the cards that they
12:43 - did have to make them but then they
12:44 - added horizontal cards and they're
12:46 - awesome so this is the documentation for
12:49 - materialized so this one I'm talking
12:50 - about a horizontal card so we'll have an
12:52 - image here and then a little bit of text
12:56 - and in this case they have a link here
12:58 - I'm thinking for right now
13:03 - maybe the link would actually open up a
13:06 - modal that would have more information
13:09 - because we can't possibly put all that
13:11 - text that's in the bio here and that
13:14 - link I think there's a possibility there
13:17 - could be YouTube videos for a lot of
13:21 - these
13:21 - team members at some point on the road
13:24 - so the modal would also work for that as
13:26 - well you can definitely do a YouTube
13:28 - embed in a modal and and that would work
13:32 - I think that would that would look fun
13:33 - so for now that's the plan we're going
13:36 - to put those all those images and
13:39 - actually I'd like to make the images
13:41 - square if I could I think that's the
13:44 - only way I'm going to be able to get all
13:46 - these images the same size the the
13:48 - chances of actually finding pictures
13:50 - that are all the same or taking pictures
13:52 - for all these people or just it's not
13:53 - going to happen not all of them are even
13:56 - here on campus so we just can't do it
13:59 - but I think if we go square you know
14:03 - every one of these pictures could
14:05 - possibly be edited to be a square and at
14:08 - least show somebody's face so that's
14:11 - what we're going to go with I just hope
14:12 - that they're big enough so that I could
14:14 - get a decent sized square but the
14:17 - horizontal cards as you can see are they
14:19 - aren't really that big they don't have
14:20 - to be that big so that's the plan so
14:22 - we're going to grab some of this code
14:23 - for a horizontal card and let's put it
14:28 - in a page to see how it looks and see
14:31 - how it looks when we put a bunch of them
14:32 - in there just to get a feel for like
14:34 - will this actually work okay somebody
14:41 - asked how long I've been using
14:42 - materialized framework I've actually
14:45 - been using materialized for about two
14:49 - years I think about two years so when I
14:54 - first started using it I wasn't exactly
14:57 - sure if it was production ready or not
14:58 - there were definitely some live sites
15:00 - that were using it I never had any
15:02 - problems any major problems with
15:04 - anything you know breaking there was
15:07 - some like on edge cases mostly having to
15:10 - do with putting like a lot of text as
15:13 - the title in a card or something and
15:15 - having some so weird things happen when
15:17 - it wrapped onto another line but all in
15:24 - all I think it's a good framework the
15:26 - only thing that I don't like about it
15:28 - now that it really it's it's part of a
15:32 - lot of frameworks is that it requires
15:33 - jQuery and so
15:35 - I'm no problem with jQuery I use it on a
15:37 - lot of my sites but I'm starting to get
15:39 - more into react and from everything I've
15:42 - read about reacts you really shouldn't
15:44 - use jQuery with it it's not that it
15:46 - won't work but it's better not to use it
15:50 - I'm not a react expert but it has to do
15:53 - with the way react tracks the Dom it has
15:56 - this virtual Dom and if you change the
16:01 - Dom with jQuery after the fact that it
16:04 - loads it can mess up react to them so
16:07 - that's I don't know any more in detail
16:09 - about it but so at some point I would
16:12 - really love to I don't kind of convert
16:17 - materialized framework to react
16:19 - components and rewrite everything and
16:23 - just vanilla JavaScript I think there
16:26 - are already some people trying to do
16:27 - that so maybe I'll just check out their
16:29 - repo and try to contribute to that so
16:33 - someday someday hopefully I'll get that
16:35 - done but for now I'm just I'm going to
16:38 - keep working with it it just saves so
16:40 - much time now they put in a lot a lot of
16:42 - work into this this framework and it
16:46 - works well
16:50 - so we asked why am i doing so many divs
16:53 - yeah that's just that's just how the
16:55 - framework is with with all these divs so
17:01 - when you're using a framework you can't
17:04 - you're kind of locked into how they have
17:06 - things set up I don't know if I would
17:08 - use that many gives if I was doing it
17:10 - from scratch but I've it's actually not
17:13 - that bad compared to how many divs are
17:15 - used in the like this current site that
17:18 - I'm using kind of as my example to go
17:21 - off of there's a lot of divs in there
17:24 - all right so let's put this in and I'm
17:28 - going to put it I'd like to see what it
17:29 - looks like on both these backgrounds on
17:31 - the white background and on the red
17:34 - background so I'm going to put it in
17:36 - both those places so here's here's our
17:39 - HTML for that page you see from
17:42 - yesterday actually went through and
17:44 - duplicated this and all the pages for
17:46 - the main menu just so you know
17:48 - have them be able to to work on them on
17:52 - okay all right so this section let's pop
17:57 - in let's pop this in here pop one of
18:06 - these in I guess I didn't need this
18:13 - header okay and let's go ahead and put
18:26 - this let's put another one down here
18:33 - whoops I didn't grab the columns too
18:37 - sorry if this is confusing to you you
18:40 - know there's there's kind of a lot this
18:42 - is kind of the grid system the column
18:43 - system for materialised check out I have
18:46 - a link in the description so if you
18:48 - check out their documentation it should
18:49 - make a lot more sense all the source
18:51 - code for this is on github as well for
18:53 - the project that I'm doing so you can
18:56 - follow along I'll try to keep that I'll
18:58 - try to push changes right after I'm done
19:00 - with the video and then that way it'll
19:02 - be all up-to-date for you and if you if
19:07 - you want to you know submit a pull
19:11 - request or something to contribute to
19:12 - the project that would be awesome too
19:14 - I'm definitely up for that alright so
19:17 - let's see what the scale is okay um I
19:21 - mean let me change the columns I wanted
19:25 - to see how this looked like side by side
19:27 - so we have if we change this to m6 this
19:32 - is out of a twelve column layout so if
19:35 - we give it m6 that means on a
19:37 - medium-sized screen it'll take up six of
19:40 - those twelve columns so this should be
19:41 - side by side okay side by side and I
19:47 - once again I forgot to take out this
19:50 - header okay all right so we have these
19:55 - side by side it's not that this this is
20:00 - a little bit of problem though
20:02 - see how this image looks when when we
20:05 - have too much text if we're going to do
20:13 - the horizontal cards like this we got to
20:16 - make sure we've got to make sure there's
20:19 - definitely a limit on how much text can
20:21 - be in here to make sure we don't I don't
20:26 - like that at the bottom that makes it
20:28 - look kind of like it's it's broken
20:31 - so we'll have to watch out for that I'll
20:35 - work on that at some point later today
20:38 - just to check it but if if we can get it
20:42 - to the point where whenever we're not
20:43 - seeing that gap at the bottom I think
20:45 - these will work this will allow us to do
20:47 - two columns instead of one long column
20:49 - for all the team members we can I think
20:55 - we can alternate the white sections and
20:57 - the red sections to differentiate
21:00 - between all those different categories
21:02 - that we saw let me go back to our
21:03 - example so we had that you know four
21:10 - categories here so I think we could do
21:12 - like you know we could definitely do the
21:14 - four categories the only one I'm worried
21:17 - about is the second one I think there's
21:18 - like 37 different people that we need
21:21 - two different BIOS we need to put in
21:23 - that's a lot it's a lot of scrolling
21:27 - okay so here's what we'll do right now
21:30 - I'm going to copy these a little bit I
21:33 - said I want to check out how they look
21:35 - on this background and I just want to
21:38 - get a feel for how did these stack I'm
21:42 - going to chain move the screen in a
21:44 - little bit normally um I wouldn't be
21:51 - doing making so many design decisions as
21:54 - I'm developing this is kind of a special
21:57 - case this project has a super tight
22:00 - timeline and I didn't even know at the
22:02 - beginning the week that I'd be working
22:03 - on it so that's why we're combining
22:06 - those steps it's usually better to kind
22:10 - of have the design more lock down at
22:12 - first before you do this I don't
22:16 - I'm doing it like this but sometimes
22:19 - it's you waste a little bit of time
22:22 - trying things that end up not working
22:23 - and if you would have just maybe planned
22:26 - them out in Photoshop or sketch or
22:28 - whatever the new thing adobe has that's
22:31 - that's like sketch I can't really what
22:32 - is called you plant it on something like
22:34 - that first it could save you might be
22:36 - able save you some time I guess it just
22:38 - depends on whether you're faster with
22:40 - code or faster with Photoshop all right
22:43 - so let's just grab some of these and and
22:46 - copy and paste them just to give us a
22:49 - more realistic look for how this will be
22:51 - when we get a lot of a lot of these in
22:54 - here I'm just going to pop in so that
22:57 - was really quick but what I did is is I
22:59 - copied the whole row so this div is a
23:02 - row div and then inside each row we have
23:05 - two columns if we can I'd love to go on
23:09 - a bigger screen maybe even up to three
23:11 - columns if it'll work so maybe we can
23:14 - test that out maybe not today because we
23:17 - have about seven minutes left maybe I'll
23:19 - try it out later and show you tomorrow
23:21 - if it worked and where's the red section
23:25 - I want to get into under that red
23:28 - section up here there we go and let's
23:32 - pop in a couple of these in there as
23:35 - well it should look about the same in
23:38 - the red section I'm just what I'm really
23:39 - worried about is just that white right
23:42 - up against the red and just just kind of
23:44 - seeing if it works sometimes you just
23:46 - don't know until you get it on the page
23:48 - whoa okay well this is cool
23:53 - somewhere I have it set to have white
23:56 - text inside which makes sense because
23:58 - you want the white text against the red
23:59 - background so that's an easy fix we'll
24:04 - scroll up to the top and materialize
24:08 - there we go to this class called white
24:11 - text that's one of their helper classes
24:14 - they're building the framework that is
24:17 - probably where we're getting that style
24:18 - from so if I take that out there we go
24:21 - we have the text with modders yeah I've
24:26 - had a couple people are asking will this
24:29 - be recorded
24:30 - the video gets automatically uploaded to
24:32 - the channel really kind of minutes after
24:35 - the livestream ends so if you jumped in
24:38 - the middle you know just check out the
24:40 - the recording of it later I mean it it's
24:44 - usually like five minutes or less the
24:46 - seems like the video is posted okay and
24:53 - like I said earlier in case you didn't
24:56 - catch that if you're asking something a
24:58 - live chat and I miss it because it is a
25:00 - little bit hard to keep up with the live
25:01 - chat and do the code just ask it in the
25:04 - comments because I'll read the comments
25:05 - afterwards and I'll try to get back to
25:07 - you as soon as I can okay
25:11 - this doesn't look terrible I really kind
25:15 - of don't like that it's so uniformed all
25:17 - the way down I was a little bit afraid
25:20 - of that I think there needs to be
25:23 - something to break this up so we need
25:27 - some sections my my first idea is this
25:30 - all this big block of text here that we
25:34 - kind of don't want in a big block maybe
25:37 - rework the text and actually my boss is
25:41 - great at this he always handles tech
25:43 - stuff for me which is awesome because I
25:46 - don't want to deal with tech stuff and
25:48 - it usually takes me a long time maybe we
25:52 - can say okay we want like three sections
25:54 - you want this broken out into three
25:56 - sections we can do a much bigger font
25:58 - maybe like a responsive font so it the
26:00 - font size changes with screen size I
26:02 - really like that materialise has that
26:04 - built in as well and then we can have
26:09 - maybe some some different colored
26:10 - sections in between possibly you know we
26:16 - could possibly have all these cards on
26:18 - white sections and then the text on the
26:22 - red sections or we could do maybe some
26:24 - sort of parallax section with with an
26:27 - image that might work to break things up
26:32 - we can actually test that out right now
26:35 - let's here's a good good way to test
26:39 - this will be to let's grab
26:43 - all of this that we just put here all of
26:47 - these rows hopefully I can I can catch
26:51 - the right spot here section yeah this is
26:59 - it hopefully I can grab yeah
27:11 - okay pretty much you have everything I
27:14 - got one extra did that I didn't need so
27:17 - let's just add that back in and for now
27:20 - we'll just let's pop in an H and H tune
27:22 - and just be text and we'll pop in a
27:30 - paragraph tag and just put we should be
27:33 - able to
27:34 - let's give it a class of flow text
27:38 - within materialized this will give us
27:40 - kind of a responsive effect on our font
27:43 - it will change font sizes and I think if
27:46 - there we go I'm using Adam as my cutted
27:49 - editor and I think this is built-in it's
27:51 - possible it's from some plug-in I loaded
27:53 - a long time ago I forgot about but if we
27:56 - can just type in lorem and hit tab and
27:58 - it gives us some lorem ipsum text wow
28:00 - that's a lot okay so that's cool we can
28:04 - see the lorem ipsum and here's what I
28:07 - want to do I'm just going to take this
28:10 - section we'll leave that heading and I
28:13 - want to keep that heading in actually
28:15 - we'll leave that whole row so is the row
28:17 - stuff and we'll pop in all that stuff
28:19 - all those cars that were the read
28:20 - section and now they're going to be in
28:22 - the section on the top and that'll let
28:23 - us see what it looks like when we have a
28:25 - divider okay um that's not terrible it
28:28 - doesn't look too and we took out the
28:31 - white text class so let's put that back
28:34 - in I'm somewhat new to live streaming so
28:40 - if you couldn't already tell and what I
28:44 - found over the last couple of weeks is
28:46 - that you miss little things that you
28:48 - would probably never miss normally when
28:51 - you're trying to talk at the same time
28:53 - as as code so I'm not quite such a noob
28:58 - as I have here today I have one eye when
29:01 - I live steering okay that does break
29:05 - things up a bit I don't know if you guys
29:08 - can see it but it seemed to me yeah it
29:14 - seems to me like it's not quite as it's
29:16 - just monotonous and repetitive okay
29:20 - I'm happy enough with that that I think
29:22 - it's worthwhile to go through and
29:24 - actually
29:25 - you know maybe try out three columns try
29:28 - to try to get this to the image to
29:31 - always look good put in maybe some a few
29:35 - real images from from the ones that
29:37 - we're actually going to use yeah I think
29:40 - that's worth whoa all right so I'm
29:43 - coming to the end of my stream got about
29:45 - a minute left oh thanks I'm getting some
29:50 - real positive feedback there
29:52 - thank you and I'm serious if you have
29:54 - any tips for me you know I'm for my code
29:57 - I always been trying to get better and
29:59 - for my live streams I I'm really new so
30:01 - I know I can get better at this so I
30:03 - really love the positive feedback but I
30:07 - welcome some criticism as well I have
30:11 - one question here that I think I can
30:12 - answer before we run out of time
30:13 - and it's can you make a video how to set
30:16 - up the Adam editor for most efficiency
30:18 - okay I can make a where do you tip I
30:22 - must I don't have a tip button right now
30:24 - maybe I actually purposely did not want
30:27 - to seem like I'm trying to do this for
30:29 - any type of money at all at first uh
30:31 - maybe one day if it starts taking up a
30:34 - lot of my time it might make more sense
30:36 - to ask for tips
30:38 - but right now I'm actually doing this at
30:41 - my regular job my boss is awesome and he
30:43 - realizes how how much value that there
30:46 - isn't something like this so I just
30:49 - wouldn't feel right getting paid on top
30:51 - of my normal wage for doing this but if
30:54 - I start doing more videos I definitely
30:57 - will as for the video about Adam I'm
31:00 - writing it down right now and I'm not
31:04 - sure that I have the best set up I'm
31:06 - there's I'm fact I know there's got to
31:09 - be people that have better more
31:11 - efficient setups than me but I will
31:12 - definitely share the way I have it set
31:14 - up and maybe maybe that will help but
31:16 - maybe you can improve on it should do a
31:20 - mobile-first
31:21 - yeah you're right about the mobile first
31:24 - sorry I'm going over a little bit as
31:25 - trying to answer some more questions
31:26 - here the the comment was most users will
31:30 - be your website through mobile instead
31:32 - of a desktop or laptop
31:34 - this is this is kind of I'm really glad
31:36 - that you said that in this case some of
31:39 - the people that I'm working with for
31:41 - this site we're kind of trying to get a
31:44 - feel for the audience and there's been
31:48 - some talk that the audience isn't going
31:50 - to be a mobile-first audience is going
31:51 - to be an older audience but I agree with
31:53 - you I think the even if it is an older
31:56 - audience we still should do a mobile
31:58 - first so normally that is how I do
32:00 - things in this case I didn't partially
32:06 - because I'm kind of working from an
32:07 - already partially completed site but
32:11 - you're right normally I would do all the
32:13 - Styles focused really small and then
32:16 - kind of go up maybe I'll switch up to
32:18 - that but that's definitely a good tip I
32:21 - highly recommend that if you're starting
32:23 - a project from scratch do everything
32:26 - with the mobile in mind and then then
32:30 - start to expand the screen and say okay
32:33 - what else can we add now and then that
32:35 - way your users won't feel like mobile as
32:37 - an afterthought you know you put most of
32:39 - your thought into the mobile experience
32:40 - and the desktop will feel really clean
32:43 - and not cluttered because you know you
32:46 - all your content is off the most for
32:48 - mobile so anyway I don't want to make
32:51 - this video too long and be intimidating
32:53 - for people to watch it again thanks for
32:56 - all the feedback if you have any more
32:59 - questions leave them in the comments
33:00 - check out I have some links down below
33:04 - for some of the tools that I'm using and
33:06 - places where you can see the code and
33:08 - everything and I'll be back tomorrow at
33:12 - 2 p.m. I'm going to do the stream on
33:15 - free code camp channel again if I do
33:17 - some of those videos like on Adam or
33:19 - some other things some short tutorial
33:21 - videos I'll probably throw those on my
33:23 - my personal channel and so thanks thanks
33:27 - for all the feedback and everything else
33:30 - getting throughout the video I'll see
33:32 - you tomorrow

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie I'm a frontend developer and this livestream is just about showing people what I do so whatever I happen to be working on at this time of day pretty much every day every weekday you guys will see I want you to see all my mistakes interruptions everything that would happen in a normal day so this is entirely unscripted and hopefully I'll give you just a little glimpse of how at least one frontend developer does his work we are in the middle of a project let me give you a quick recap I have some info in the description for this livestream and I also have some videos I've done before this of one other video on this channel free code camp and then I have some other videos on my channel and the link is in the description so we have a partially finished website that I'm going to take and finish but I'm finishing it kind of in a different format so the partially finished website was built with Drupal we're going to build this first it's just a static HTML site and then eventually we're going to convert that to react components and we're going to render that serverside and all the content is going to be pulled in from WordPress through the WordPress API so the react site will exist on a different server from the WordPress site and all the content will come from there but we'll set all that up and in the weeks to come for now we need to get this site finished and ready to go by Monday and the site actually has to launch probably by the 13th so I want to get it done by Monday so that we have at least a few days for testing and making Changez if you have any other questions about why we're doing this or background for the project just put them in the comments you can put them in the live chat too but if there's a lot of people in the latch at it's hard for me to keep track of it so if I do miss your question a lot of chat just put it in the comments and then I'll get to it later later on and I try to answer everybody that their comments if you're returning thanks for watching yesterday the response was amazing I think we have over 5,000 views on yesterday's video and in 24 hours which is which is crazy I live in a town that has maybe 18,000 people at most so to get 5,000 views in a day on one of my videos it's just really great and I had so much positive feedback out of lots of thumbs up only four thumbs down which is great if you do thumbs down the video that's that's fine with me but it would be cool if you comment below and give me some feedback so I can make this stream better I think I mean I'm definitely welcome to feedback I mean if you're mean about it I mean that stinks but I'll I'll be able to handle it alright so enough introduction let's just get to it here's what we've been working on not a whole lot has changed since yesterday at least visibly a lot of the work that I've done has just been on the mobile breakpoints making sure the positioning is okay so PC is as I shrink this down everything still looks pretty good I added a slight border on the bottom here to me that it just looked a little bit better with that border I'm not I'm not entirely sold on it it might change let me know what you think but it I was just used to seeing this read up against the black and not the black straight on the white so it it just seemed nicer to have a little bit of that red there and let me show you this is an interior page and let me show you on the home page we did make some changes so you still have this and this one is actually growing on me I know I said yesterday I might change it but you will see I'm getting used to it and so it might stay and then now once we get smaller everything's still looking pretty good when we get to a certain point when the image and the font would normally squish together we actually just switch right back to that interior header so it'll look the same as the interior pages also if the screen is short it will switch back but just in case somebody has a really big phone and they're in landscape mode it's possible that their screen is would be wide enough to not hit that break point but still short enough so that the text would actually be all up here the tagline text and it would cover up the logo so that's why I did you'd see here in this media query this is how I did that I said it max with inside of media create 600 pixels and then a comma which basically acts like an or if you're writing a media query comma and then I added that max height as well so I just pop those in just on the few elements the header the nav the logo the few elements that needed to change you see where the entire hero section is just completely not even displayed and this will help us too because we won't need to make as many image sizes for all the different screen sizes before I think we had three or four different media queries so we have all these different image sizes now we won't have to mess with that for today's video what I want to work on is this page this team page and as I said this is coming from a site that is partially finished so let me show you what we have to work with in terms of the content that's already there and it's not it's going to be a little bit of a challenge okay so here's the current team page from from the site that's unfinished I haven't eruption so this is this is great from me let me check it real quick sorry Jesse you're active I'm really sorry it's all I got okay okay that's awesome I'm actually glad interruption because that's like a normal normal day you can't always just have all your time to completely focus on the code that was actually the head of the department that I'm building this site for so that was that was cool he's a super nice guy he was really apologetic for interrupting the livestream okay so let's see this team page so right now obviously we've already changed the header you know this this isn't going to be here I think this is just too much stuff at the top without seeing the content I'm not I'm not entirely thrilled about this large block of text I don't like the font it just seems kind of difficult to read maybe it just maybe it just needs to be bigger or maybe not the white on the dark red either way you know we're going to change it we're probably not even going to have this this block of text at all or you know we definitely should cut it down and break it up I'm a big fan of really just minimal text on pages and if you have some interior pages that people expect have a lot of text like a blog post people expect to read that's fine but on a page like this I don't think anybody would expect to click on teams and the first thing they get is a very large paragraph what they're expecting is you know probably this and their BIOS for the people who are on the team this is actually the person that just interrupted the last shame accidentally so I'm Adam he's what a nice is sketchy over me so right now they have this this kind of accordion there's a couple of problems it's not it's not that easy for the people that are in charge of the content they don't have any experience is with code and they're not going to and that's fine but they need a way to edit this easily and right now this entire section here which goes on for a while is all one big kind of WYSIWYG section so in the the admin panel and Drupal you know they literally had to type out all of this and try to position the images and it's hard enough to do that if you know code you know let alone if you're just trying to put this you know put this in with with little background I'm going to check the lighter so I can see if I need any answer anything yeah these will all be available afterwards so somebody just asked if if these will be available yeah they are so the some of my previous ones are available in my youtube channel and that's linked in the description and then yesterday I just started streaming on free code camp so yesterday's is available there so between the two channels you'll be able to get everything and if you have any other questions just let me know in the comments and I'll be happy to answer them I'd like to do some shorter videos that are prerecorded and just kind of explaining things in more depth and in this format it's like oh you're welcome and this format it's just kind of I don't think it's the best format for teaching I don't want to mislead anybody by forgetting something or leaving it out so I really like to take time to kind of prepare and do a nice video edit everything so if you know this would be more of the teaching videos I'm sure that and I hope that you'll learn something with with the live streams but this is just more kind of a glimpse into my my day okay so the one problem with this is the fact that it's not easy to edit for the people that need to be to update this content the second thing is the the formatting is just not really and this is it's just not you can see it's it's not uniform okay we have all the image sizes or all different sizes some of them are aligned differently there's a lot going on not only that there's there's some just weird issues when you click this you'll wind up in the middle so I think I want to get away from I want to get away from the accordion I'm still thinking about maybe some sort of accordion for mobile just to cut down on the amount of scrolling that somebody would have to do on a phone but there's a lot of little BIOS here in pictures a lot so we need some way to be able to display these that's that's not going to seem really cluttered so here's my idea I was going a little bit of sketching earlier and was actually as to the meeting so if you guys are work for a company or something you have frequent meetings always bring a sketch pad or something because you get ideas and and I got some ideas for this in the middle of meeting and I sketched it out so you're obviously not going to be able to see my sketch I probably should have taken a picture of it first to show you but I'll just explain it what I'm kind of thinking is maybe some horizontal like material type design style cards actually I can't show you an example I'm using the materialized framework it's kind of like you know bootstrap or foundation but with a material design you'll kind of build into it so let me show you how they do their horizontal cars and this is kind of a newer thing when I first started using materialized they didn't have horizontal cards actually had to get a kind of adjust the cards that they did have to make them but then they added horizontal cards and they're awesome so this is the documentation for materialized so this one I'm talking about a horizontal card so we'll have an image here and then a little bit of text and in this case they have a link here I'm thinking for right now maybe the link would actually open up a modal that would have more information because we can't possibly put all that text that's in the bio here and that link I think there's a possibility there could be YouTube videos for a lot of these team members at some point on the road so the modal would also work for that as well you can definitely do a YouTube embed in a modal and and that would work I think that would that would look fun so for now that's the plan we're going to put those all those images and actually I'd like to make the images square if I could I think that's the only way I'm going to be able to get all these images the same size the the chances of actually finding pictures that are all the same or taking pictures for all these people or just it's not going to happen not all of them are even here on campus so we just can't do it but I think if we go square you know every one of these pictures could possibly be edited to be a square and at least show somebody's face so that's what we're going to go with I just hope that they're big enough so that I could get a decent sized square but the horizontal cards as you can see are they aren't really that big they don't have to be that big so that's the plan so we're going to grab some of this code for a horizontal card and let's put it in a page to see how it looks and see how it looks when we put a bunch of them in there just to get a feel for like will this actually work okay somebody asked how long I've been using materialized framework I've actually been using materialized for about two years I think about two years so when I first started using it I wasn't exactly sure if it was production ready or not there were definitely some live sites that were using it I never had any problems any major problems with anything you know breaking there was some like on edge cases mostly having to do with putting like a lot of text as the title in a card or something and having some so weird things happen when it wrapped onto another line but all in all I think it's a good framework the only thing that I don't like about it now that it really it's it's part of a lot of frameworks is that it requires jQuery and so I'm no problem with jQuery I use it on a lot of my sites but I'm starting to get more into react and from everything I've read about reacts you really shouldn't use jQuery with it it's not that it won't work but it's better not to use it I'm not a react expert but it has to do with the way react tracks the Dom it has this virtual Dom and if you change the Dom with jQuery after the fact that it loads it can mess up react to them so that's I don't know any more in detail about it but so at some point I would really love to I don't kind of convert materialized framework to react components and rewrite everything and just vanilla JavaScript I think there are already some people trying to do that so maybe I'll just check out their repo and try to contribute to that so someday someday hopefully I'll get that done but for now I'm just I'm going to keep working with it it just saves so much time now they put in a lot a lot of work into this this framework and it works well so we asked why am i doing so many divs yeah that's just that's just how the framework is with with all these divs so when you're using a framework you can't you're kind of locked into how they have things set up I don't know if I would use that many gives if I was doing it from scratch but I've it's actually not that bad compared to how many divs are used in the like this current site that I'm using kind of as my example to go off of there's a lot of divs in there all right so let's put this in and I'm going to put it I'd like to see what it looks like on both these backgrounds on the white background and on the red background so I'm going to put it in both those places so here's here's our HTML for that page you see from yesterday actually went through and duplicated this and all the pages for the main menu just so you know have them be able to to work on them on okay all right so this section let's pop in let's pop this in here pop one of these in I guess I didn't need this header okay and let's go ahead and put this let's put another one down here whoops I didn't grab the columns too sorry if this is confusing to you you know there's there's kind of a lot this is kind of the grid system the column system for materialised check out I have a link in the description so if you check out their documentation it should make a lot more sense all the source code for this is on github as well for the project that I'm doing so you can follow along I'll try to keep that I'll try to push changes right after I'm done with the video and then that way it'll be all uptodate for you and if you if you want to you know submit a pull request or something to contribute to the project that would be awesome too I'm definitely up for that alright so let's see what the scale is okay um I mean let me change the columns I wanted to see how this looked like side by side so we have if we change this to m6 this is out of a twelve column layout so if we give it m6 that means on a mediumsized screen it'll take up six of those twelve columns so this should be side by side okay side by side and I once again I forgot to take out this header okay all right so we have these side by side it's not that this this is a little bit of problem though see how this image looks when when we have too much text if we're going to do the horizontal cards like this we got to make sure we've got to make sure there's definitely a limit on how much text can be in here to make sure we don't I don't like that at the bottom that makes it look kind of like it's it's broken so we'll have to watch out for that I'll work on that at some point later today just to check it but if if we can get it to the point where whenever we're not seeing that gap at the bottom I think these will work this will allow us to do two columns instead of one long column for all the team members we can I think we can alternate the white sections and the red sections to differentiate between all those different categories that we saw let me go back to our example so we had that you know four categories here so I think we could do like you know we could definitely do the four categories the only one I'm worried about is the second one I think there's like 37 different people that we need two different BIOS we need to put in that's a lot it's a lot of scrolling okay so here's what we'll do right now I'm going to copy these a little bit I said I want to check out how they look on this background and I just want to get a feel for how did these stack I'm going to chain move the screen in a little bit normally um I wouldn't be doing making so many design decisions as I'm developing this is kind of a special case this project has a super tight timeline and I didn't even know at the beginning the week that I'd be working on it so that's why we're combining those steps it's usually better to kind of have the design more lock down at first before you do this I don't I'm doing it like this but sometimes it's you waste a little bit of time trying things that end up not working and if you would have just maybe planned them out in Photoshop or sketch or whatever the new thing adobe has that's that's like sketch I can't really what is called you plant it on something like that first it could save you might be able save you some time I guess it just depends on whether you're faster with code or faster with Photoshop all right so let's just grab some of these and and copy and paste them just to give us a more realistic look for how this will be when we get a lot of a lot of these in here I'm just going to pop in so that was really quick but what I did is is I copied the whole row so this div is a row div and then inside each row we have two columns if we can I'd love to go on a bigger screen maybe even up to three columns if it'll work so maybe we can test that out maybe not today because we have about seven minutes left maybe I'll try it out later and show you tomorrow if it worked and where's the red section I want to get into under that red section up here there we go and let's pop in a couple of these in there as well it should look about the same in the red section I'm just what I'm really worried about is just that white right up against the red and just just kind of seeing if it works sometimes you just don't know until you get it on the page whoa okay well this is cool somewhere I have it set to have white text inside which makes sense because you want the white text against the red background so that's an easy fix we'll scroll up to the top and materialize there we go to this class called white text that's one of their helper classes they're building the framework that is probably where we're getting that style from so if I take that out there we go we have the text with modders yeah I've had a couple people are asking will this be recorded the video gets automatically uploaded to the channel really kind of minutes after the livestream ends so if you jumped in the middle you know just check out the the recording of it later I mean it it's usually like five minutes or less the seems like the video is posted okay and like I said earlier in case you didn't catch that if you're asking something a live chat and I miss it because it is a little bit hard to keep up with the live chat and do the code just ask it in the comments because I'll read the comments afterwards and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can okay this doesn't look terrible I really kind of don't like that it's so uniformed all the way down I was a little bit afraid of that I think there needs to be something to break this up so we need some sections my my first idea is this all this big block of text here that we kind of don't want in a big block maybe rework the text and actually my boss is great at this he always handles tech stuff for me which is awesome because I don't want to deal with tech stuff and it usually takes me a long time maybe we can say okay we want like three sections you want this broken out into three sections we can do a much bigger font maybe like a responsive font so it the font size changes with screen size I really like that materialise has that built in as well and then we can have maybe some some different colored sections in between possibly you know we could possibly have all these cards on white sections and then the text on the red sections or we could do maybe some sort of parallax section with with an image that might work to break things up we can actually test that out right now let's here's a good good way to test this will be to let's grab all of this that we just put here all of these rows hopefully I can I can catch the right spot here section yeah this is it hopefully I can grab yeah okay pretty much you have everything I got one extra did that I didn't need so let's just add that back in and for now we'll just let's pop in an H and H tune and just be text and we'll pop in a paragraph tag and just put we should be able to let's give it a class of flow text within materialized this will give us kind of a responsive effect on our font it will change font sizes and I think if there we go I'm using Adam as my cutted editor and I think this is builtin it's possible it's from some plugin I loaded a long time ago I forgot about but if we can just type in lorem and hit tab and it gives us some lorem ipsum text wow that's a lot okay so that's cool we can see the lorem ipsum and here's what I want to do I'm just going to take this section we'll leave that heading and I want to keep that heading in actually we'll leave that whole row so is the row stuff and we'll pop in all that stuff all those cars that were the read section and now they're going to be in the section on the top and that'll let us see what it looks like when we have a divider okay um that's not terrible it doesn't look too and we took out the white text class so let's put that back in I'm somewhat new to live streaming so if you couldn't already tell and what I found over the last couple of weeks is that you miss little things that you would probably never miss normally when you're trying to talk at the same time as as code so I'm not quite such a noob as I have here today I have one eye when I live steering okay that does break things up a bit I don't know if you guys can see it but it seemed to me yeah it seems to me like it's not quite as it's just monotonous and repetitive okay I'm happy enough with that that I think it's worthwhile to go through and actually you know maybe try out three columns try to try to get this to the image to always look good put in maybe some a few real images from from the ones that we're actually going to use yeah I think that's worth whoa all right so I'm coming to the end of my stream got about a minute left oh thanks I'm getting some real positive feedback there thank you and I'm serious if you have any tips for me you know I'm for my code I always been trying to get better and for my live streams I I'm really new so I know I can get better at this so I really love the positive feedback but I welcome some criticism as well I have one question here that I think I can answer before we run out of time and it's can you make a video how to set up the Adam editor for most efficiency okay I can make a where do you tip I must I don't have a tip button right now maybe I actually purposely did not want to seem like I'm trying to do this for any type of money at all at first uh maybe one day if it starts taking up a lot of my time it might make more sense to ask for tips but right now I'm actually doing this at my regular job my boss is awesome and he realizes how how much value that there isn't something like this so I just wouldn't feel right getting paid on top of my normal wage for doing this but if I start doing more videos I definitely will as for the video about Adam I'm writing it down right now and I'm not sure that I have the best set up I'm there's I'm fact I know there's got to be people that have better more efficient setups than me but I will definitely share the way I have it set up and maybe maybe that will help but maybe you can improve on it should do a mobilefirst yeah you're right about the mobile first sorry I'm going over a little bit as trying to answer some more questions here the the comment was most users will be your website through mobile instead of a desktop or laptop this is this is kind of I'm really glad that you said that in this case some of the people that I'm working with for this site we're kind of trying to get a feel for the audience and there's been some talk that the audience isn't going to be a mobilefirst audience is going to be an older audience but I agree with you I think the even if it is an older audience we still should do a mobile first so normally that is how I do things in this case I didn't partially because I'm kind of working from an already partially completed site but you're right normally I would do all the Styles focused really small and then kind of go up maybe I'll switch up to that but that's definitely a good tip I highly recommend that if you're starting a project from scratch do everything with the mobile in mind and then then start to expand the screen and say okay what else can we add now and then that way your users won't feel like mobile as an afterthought you know you put most of your thought into the mobile experience and the desktop will feel really clean and not cluttered because you know you all your content is off the most for mobile so anyway I don't want to make this video too long and be intimidating for people to watch it again thanks for all the feedback if you have any more questions leave them in the comments check out I have some links down below for some of the tools that I'm using and places where you can see the code and everything and I'll be back tomorrow at 2 p.m. I'm going to do the stream on free code camp channel again if I do some of those videos like on Adam or some other things some short tutorial videos I'll probably throw those on my my personal channel and so thanks thanks for all the feedback and everything else getting throughout the video I'll see you tomorrow
