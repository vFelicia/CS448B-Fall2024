With timestamps:

00:06 - hey everybody its Jessie and good
00:10 - morning if you're in my timezone or near
00:13 - there so this is a lot earlier than I
00:18 - normally stream but we all get here at
00:23 - the University we all get pretty much
00:24 - everybody gets to go home at at noon
00:26 - today because there's a big conference
00:29 - going on and they need the parking
00:32 - spaces for the people attending the
00:33 - conference so we all have to leave
00:37 - so still wanted to do a stream so we're
00:40 - gonna do one it's gonna have to be a
00:41 - short stream though because I I knew I
00:44 - had a meeting at 11:30 but I had
00:47 - completely forgot that there was also a
00:49 - going-away party for somebody that works
00:52 - here in the same building as I do at
00:54 - 11:00 so I'd like to I'd like to stop
00:58 - into that cuz he's a really nice guy so
01:01 - I like to be able to say goodbye to him
01:03 - before before he leaves so I I was just
01:09 - in the middle of reviewing pool requests
01:11 - so kevin has submitted to pool requests
01:16 - they both look really good i am i've
01:19 - already merged one and i was just kind
01:22 - of testing the the second one and this
01:25 - is kevin AKA
01:27 - kevie and 60 20 in the in the chat so
01:32 - i'm not sure if he's in the chat or not
01:33 - i expect this is going to be a smaller
01:35 - audience since it's a totally different
01:38 - time and I didn't even post it on on
01:43 - Twitter or anything like til I don't
01:45 - maybe a half hour ago probably not even
01:48 - that long ago so hey everybody there are
01:53 - a few people and the chat is picking up
01:56 - a little bit okay so I'm just gonna
01:59 - finish up just checking this out I'm
02:01 - looking at it there's no you know don't
02:03 - see any errors other than our normal
02:06 - errors that we get so it's looking good
02:11 - so basically what
02:13 - what Kevin did was the first thing he
02:17 - did was refactor the side nav so there's
02:19 - nothing visible that happened but behind
02:25 - the scenes there's a lot of code that it
02:30 - was kind of removed moving around and so
02:33 - it makes it a lot more a lot more
02:36 - streamlined and now for the letterhead
02:41 - he's made it so that it's basically let
02:49 - me show you the code first I guess let
02:53 - me get rid of this and open it up again
03:13 - okay cool so we have the letterhead card
03:16 - now and that's its component here so
03:21 - basically he's before remember we had
03:24 - just copied and pasted everything which
03:26 - was okay just to see how the layout
03:28 - looks but you don't want to leave it
03:29 - like that so kevin was completely right
03:32 - in refactoring this into its own
03:36 - component and now let me go back to the
03:43 - letterhead there we go so now you know
03:50 - we just have you know the letterhead
03:52 - here and it's since there's not a lot of
03:55 - them it's okay like this and I probably
03:57 - won't make it any smaller than this but
04:00 - we probably could just loop over this
04:02 - and we could take these props and put
04:06 - them in an array and then we could just
04:12 - loop over that array so we would just do
04:14 - like a red dot map and put all the cards
04:20 - you know in here like that
04:24 - so that could be a further customization
04:26 - that we could further optimization that
04:28 - we could do but I don't know for is not
04:32 - really a big deal to me if it were
04:33 - closer to like 10 then yeah I'm
04:35 - definitely making I'm gonna make an
04:37 - array and look through it alright so
04:39 - this looks good I'm just gonna check on
04:43 - my other screen I have the I'll pull
04:46 - this over in case you haven't seen it
04:47 - before this shows this is the pull
04:53 - request pull request 10 and this is just
04:56 - showing the difference between it so the
04:58 - letterhead card is entirely new so you
05:00 - see this stuff on the left hand side is
05:02 - how it was and then on the right hand
05:05 - side this is how it is now after the
05:07 - changes from the pull request so before
05:09 - we didn't have it at all and now this is
05:11 - in the air and this all looks good and
05:15 - then letterhead has changed you can see
05:20 - you know able to remove a lot of this
05:24 - stuff because now it's in letterhead
05:25 - card
05:27 - also able to remove a lot of that into
05:30 - that repetition of all that markup
05:33 - replaced with letterhead called card so
05:39 - that looks good I'm going to merge that
05:45 - also let me let me paste in the address
05:49 - for the end Rock server so I'm gonna
05:56 - paste that into the live chat and let me
06:00 - bring it over in case you can't see
06:02 - what's in the live chat it's this
06:04 - highlight highlighted bit right here if
06:07 - you can see the site as as we're working
06:11 - on it and inspect it with dev tools and
06:13 - a lot nicer than having to wait for me
06:17 - to click on something for you to check
06:19 - it out also I do have the the stream
06:24 - open on Instagram as well so let's get
06:30 - started and okay I just checked the live
06:38 - chat so Taylor asked just 31 persons
06:41 - here yeah it's just because it's in such
06:43 - a different time than I normally do and
06:45 - there I didn't give a lot of notice with
06:48 - either the YouTube alert or with my
06:51 - Twitter my tweet about it
06:55 - alright Zanna Zanna has to go she's
06:58 - going on a trip and she's got it for
07:00 - Paris so thanks for checking in have a
07:03 - great time on on your trip okay let's
07:07 - get started so hopefully now if you want
07:11 - to see this you've gotten that now we're
07:14 - going to merge this in so I've actually
07:19 - merged the master branch into this this
07:23 - branch that I pulled on for testing
07:25 - which is the pull request ten so I've
07:27 - already merged into that just to test it
07:30 - with everything and make sure it all
07:32 - works properly and
07:36 - I do want to double-check one more thing
07:40 - before I merge this and that was the
07:47 - side nav so I want to make sure
08:03 - yeah I was afraid of this that this
08:06 - might be the case let me jump back
08:31 - mm-hmm okay on my other screen I'm
08:35 - comparing that last I just wanted to
08:39 - make sure that when I did the merge that
08:41 - nothing got messed up with the last pull
08:43 - request number nine that I had merged in
08:45 - and so I just wanted to check what it
08:50 - should have looked like so let me let me
08:53 - look at this is sine MF yeah maybe this
09:03 - just to say okay maybe it is all right I
09:08 - thought I'd seen something that didn't
09:11 - look right but right now that I'm
09:13 - comparing it it looks looks about the
09:17 - same as it should yeah okay cool
09:25 - everything looks good
09:32 - so I'm gonna check out master branch I'm
09:35 - just gonna do like a basic merge I know
09:37 - we had we tried out different ways to
09:39 - merge things it in a previous stream
09:47 - what's this letter I'm just gonna do a
09:56 - really basic merge here and not go
10:01 - through so there's a look basically the
10:03 - reason I said that is there's a lot of
10:04 - options for how you merge and what
10:06 - happens when the merge goes in so you
10:09 - know the most basic is just merge but
10:13 - there's a lot of other things you can do
10:14 - with that
10:17 - all right also another thing that was
10:21 - added in pull requests 10 from Kevin was
10:26 - that the random images in fact they're
10:30 - random you know for each each card now
10:33 - which I mentioned yesterday uh I like
10:36 - that and that's really cool also this is
10:39 - fixed so before we had uneven spacing so
10:44 - between the first two cards we had no
10:46 - padding at all and we had a pretty good
10:50 - amount here probably double with this is
10:52 - and then no padding again so now that
10:56 - that problem is fixed so looking good
11:02 - let's move on now and we're gonna do is
11:06 - share a story yeah this is where we left
11:08 - off yesterday with shared story and I'll
11:11 - bring up the mean Logan even show you oh
11:15 - I also I forgot to tell you what what
11:17 - happened so yesterday I left you all and
11:22 - I had to go check out somebody's
11:25 - computer so it turns out the problem so
11:29 - basically the person could not access my
11:31 - website he was saying that there was
11:33 - just a blank screen and this has been
11:34 - going on like for a long time and other
11:38 - people
11:39 - from the IT department had tried to
11:40 - check it out and and couldn't figure out
11:42 - what's going on so my suspicion was
11:46 - correct I suspected that he was just
11:48 - using an old browser and he was he was
11:52 - trying to open it in Internet Explorer 9
11:54 - and didn't realize it so you know the
12:00 - user was you know basically not yeah
12:02 - he's not really into computers so he
12:04 - didn't realize what was happening but he
12:05 - he assumed that it was opening the link
12:08 - automatically in Chrome because that's
12:09 - what he normally used but the default
12:12 - browser on his machine was set to
12:15 - Internet Explorer 9 so that there was a
12:19 - lot of confusion I think from that
12:20 - because he was you know saying and
12:24 - thinking that it was in chrome where it
12:26 - should have worked not realizing that it
12:29 - was Internet Explorer 9 and some people
12:33 - had checked out his computer before and
12:35 - told him that his browsers were
12:36 - up-to-date so he assumed they were
12:39 - up-to-date as well so I don't know if
12:41 - they just meant chrome is up-to-date and
12:43 - didn't bother with Internet Explorer
12:46 - because they didn't think anybody would
12:47 - use it but in reality like Internet
12:50 - Explorer 9 that's pretty old
12:51 - I believe that came out in 2011 so
12:55 - really old so anyway I was i I was a
13:00 - little bit I'm relieved that it wasn't
13:03 - my project it wasn't my fault but I feel
13:07 - bad for this for this person because
13:09 - there was important information that was
13:11 - being conveyed through that that site
13:14 - and he couldn't get it for months he
13:16 - hasn't been able to get it and so I feel
13:19 - really bad about it and he was
13:21 - legitimately angry about the situation
13:23 - and I can't blame him I just wish he
13:26 - hadn't been angry at me since it wasn't
13:29 - really my fault but the unreality based
13:32 - on everything that he was saying and
13:33 - been told it seemed like it was my it
13:35 - was my issue so in fact he had actually
13:39 - been told by other people that it was it
13:40 - was on my end it's my excuse though
13:43 - so anyway I can't be mad at him I was a
13:45 - little bit upset about the whole
13:47 - situation in general of like why are we
13:49 - still have Internet Explorer 9 on
13:51 - computers and here
13:53 - so anyway but now I'm uh I'm over it I
13:56 - was I was mad for a little bit but now
14:01 - I'm cool so anyway just want to say that
14:07 - because I know you all had some of you
14:09 - had said at the end of yesterday's
14:11 - stream that you wanted the update so
14:13 - there's the update while Patrick says in
14:18 - the live chat end of support for
14:20 - Internet Explorer 9 was a year and a
14:22 - half ago Wow Wow
14:26 - I did forward on so I I wrote several
14:30 - emails to various people about what
14:33 - happened and I'm I'm trying to get the
14:37 - browser's updated or like at the very
14:41 - least I wouldn't care if they just
14:42 - deleted Internet Explorer off
14:44 - everybody's computers that would be fine
14:46 - with me too because why would you need
14:48 - everybody seems to have chrome on campus
14:51 - anyway so anyway it's not really you
14:55 - know my department's responsibility or
14:57 - my call at all I don't actually have any
14:59 - access to update anyone's browser even
15:01 - even if I wanted to so I can't really
15:07 - fix that but hopefully you know we'll be
15:10 - able to get that fixed at some point
15:12 - because this is not the only time that's
15:14 - happened
15:15 - some people somebody was using a really
15:17 - old version of Safari once and that's
15:19 - why my site didn't work
15:21 - some people continually try to log in
15:23 - with Firefox 3 from somewhere on campus
15:27 - and I can't figure out who it is because
15:30 - my my error tracking setup for that site
15:34 - also tells me their email addresses but
15:38 - the code can't even run the part where
15:40 - it grabs their email address so it gets
15:42 - held up even before that so I can get an
15:46 - IP address but I don't I don't have any
15:50 - ability to figure out whose IP that is
15:52 - so anyway enough of that hopefully I
15:59 - won't have to handle too many of those
16:02 - situations again and oops
16:06 - form we're gonna go to suggest a story
16:08 - form okay so for this form we're just
16:10 - gonna have some paragraphs and some form
16:15 - elements we decided yesterday that we
16:19 - were not gonna put this on a card we're
16:21 - gonna try to put it you know directly
16:24 - onto the paper and we're gonna make this
16:26 - font a larger size and we'll see how
16:30 - that looks so let me move this off to
16:32 - the other screen and first thing first
16:37 - things first let's just make a container
16:41 - where we got the story I thought I named
16:46 - it okay so let's copy some some some of
16:51 - the mark-up over from let's see posters
17:00 - letterhead would actually be good to
17:02 - copy it from because we have some P tags
17:06 - up at the top of the letterhead just
17:07 - like we'll have with this okay so I'm
17:15 - just gonna grab this whole container and
17:17 - then we'll remove what we don't need
17:20 - that this will save us a little bit of
17:23 - time typing and now we don't need to see
17:30 - that and we can get rid of this and I'm
17:38 - just gonna leave these paragraphs here
17:40 - because that's fine for now I don't I
17:44 - know how paragraphs are gonna act what
17:46 - I'm really worried about those I want to
17:48 - make sure that we get the right font
17:50 - size here so I am gonna pull in from
17:53 - materialize the responsive font so I
17:59 - let's see if we still have this open I
18:02 - think we do yep so we still have our
18:05 - materialized CSS file open from their
18:10 - github repo so I'm gonna find the the
18:14 - font so it's it's flow text it's not a
18:18 - font this is just the
18:20 - font-weight so you can see I'm sorry not
18:26 - the phone what I guess it does set the
18:28 - font way but the font size so you can
18:30 - see a different screen sizes the font
18:33 - size will change so there's a bunch of
18:38 - media queries so obviously like I'm not
18:41 - gonna spend my time rewriting all these
18:44 - media queries right so we're just gonna
18:46 - take this and put this in our CSS file
18:58 - and I'm just gonna take this for now it
19:00 - might be helpful to have some of these
19:02 - other kind of helper classes at some
19:04 - point but I'd rather bring in what I
19:07 - need because sometimes at the end of the
19:11 - project you never go back in and remove
19:13 - all the stuff you don't need so I'm not
19:15 - gonna copy everything in right now I'm
19:18 - gonna try to be a little bit more
19:21 - responsible about it I know the last
19:23 - project there was a bit of a mess in the
19:25 - CSS and I just ran out of time and
19:27 - didn't get to clean it up so don't want
19:31 - that to happen this time so I'm just
19:33 - gonna put this in the do we want to do
19:38 - this yeah this is I'm gonna put this in
19:43 - a separate file for now I think I'd like
19:46 - to keep my CSS in different files yeah
19:52 - and then that'll help keep it a little
19:54 - bit more clean so let's make another
19:57 - file or another yes I already made this
20:04 - aw I was thinking I'd make another
20:06 - directory but I think I already made it
20:09 - so I think we just need to touch source
20:13 - styles yep that's it and we'll name this
20:22 - all right and I'm naming it float X
20:24 - because that's the name of the class so
20:26 - I I'm immediately gonna know what that
20:29 - is I guess if you haven't worked with
20:31 - materialize you might not know what that
20:33 - is but at least you'll know maybe I
20:36 - should change it then because I do want
20:39 - people you know down the road to be able
20:40 - to look at this and see what's going on
20:42 - so we'll call responsive responsive text
20:51 - okay yeah that's a little bit more
20:53 - descriptive of what it what it is
20:58 - oops
20:59 - and I almost misspelled this so I didn't
21:02 - mean to say tough I wanted to say touch
21:05 - so touch is how you create a file in the
21:09 - command line okay now we can see that we
21:13 - have this file if I open up a folder
21:16 - here we should have that file what
21:20 - happened to this
21:37 - should be there right source styles oh I
21:42 - just didn't see it how did I not see
21:45 - that I think I was I was thinking that
21:47 - it would have showed up green since I
21:50 - just added it so that's why I didn't
21:52 - even bother reading it which I don't
21:55 - know why I didn't show up bringing
21:56 - normally new brand new files do appear
22:00 - as being green so not not really sure
22:04 - what's going on with that but we can
22:08 - finally copy this in and let's save that
22:12 - and then we'll bring in I'm probably
22:19 - gonna end up using this will it use this
22:24 - everywhere actually I won't use this
22:28 - everywhere so there are gonna be some
22:32 - pages where I won't even need this
22:34 - because we're gonna have we're not
22:37 - really gonna have blocks of text so I
22:39 - don't know that I need to pull this into
22:41 - every page let me check oh I have it on
22:48 - the other screen isolettes let's just
22:50 - check quickly because I think we can try
22:53 - to yeah I'm not I don't actually want it
22:56 - on this page I want to keep control of
23:00 - exactly what these sizes are on the home
23:04 - page same thing with this page and this
23:09 - page of text yeah
23:10 - and yeah the the text inside of cards
23:17 - I'd rather keep more control over the
23:20 - size just because I do want to make sure
23:24 - that we have cards that are the same
23:30 - height and I don't want to be huge if I
23:33 - applied the flow tech stuff in the cards
23:35 - that they would be really big so
23:38 - [Music]
23:43 - yeah so some of the like these pages
23:45 - obviously I could apply it to but yeah
23:48 - so my whole point point is like I don't
23:52 - want to have to load CSS in places where
23:55 - I'm not going to use it so here's what
23:59 - we're gonna do so we can see like on apt
24:03 - ass we're importing our Styles up at the
24:08 - top so I'm just gonna copy that and
24:10 - paste it into story and change this to
24:22 - responsive text okay now we should be
24:28 - able to put I should be able to put flow
24:32 - class or float X class here and it'll
24:35 - just apply to all these paragraph tags
24:38 - so let's see if that is the case
24:50 - oh okay I see let me
25:00 - oops you need to go out and back inside
25:05 - let's try this
25:08 - okay cool if you didn't catch that so
25:11 - initially I just had one dot which would
25:14 - have meant from where this is so from
25:17 - the views folder it was trying to find
25:20 - within the views folder a Styles folder
25:23 - okay which obviously is not the case
25:26 - okay so it worked when I had it like
25:28 - that within App dodge' ass because app
25:31 - Taj is is here within the source folder
25:36 - so what I had to do was put another dot
25:40 - and that's saying go up one level right
25:44 - so go to the source folder then try to
25:47 - look for the Styles folder so be aware
25:50 - if you're moving components into other
25:55 - other directories within your project
25:58 - that you may have to change some of this
26:01 - stuff depending on how how you've done
26:04 - it how are your projects set up so at
26:08 - some point we're gonna make a components
26:10 - folder and move some things into there
26:11 - and we'll have to take care of that when
26:15 - we do that as well so all right but for
26:18 - now it's just what we want so we have
26:20 - this it actually ends it's pretty large
26:24 - fonts you had a fonts pretty large now
26:27 - this is larger blocks of text then that
26:33 - will have so actually I think I'm going
26:39 - to bring in the the real text because I
26:43 - would like to see now that we have the
26:45 - the flow text applied I want to see what
26:48 - this would really look like so you can
26:51 - see it's not nearly as much the second
26:56 - one's going to be a bit longer
27:02 - and
27:14 - bring this in
27:28 - okay so this is the actual text
27:36 - something just looks weird to me about
27:38 - this what what is wrong with this
28:01 - I'm no does that look odd to anyone like
28:06 - it it just doesn't look as nice as maybe
28:09 - there's some conflicting styles between
28:11 - material you I and this bed yeah maybe
28:23 - that's it
28:49 - oh maybe it's the font am i not all
28:57 - right said saying the font family is
28:58 - just saying serif which is not what I
29:01 - want maybe that's what I wanted to be
29:03 - rubato which I thought Roboto was the
29:08 - default for for material UI
29:22 - maybe I missed a step and I have to
29:24 - actually pull in Roboto at some point
29:26 - let's check let's check on that because
29:30 - I'm not really gonna know if this looks
29:32 - good and unless I see the font nice
29:42 - check out usage
29:51 - I'm not seen anything there
29:59 - because there's no there's no search for
30:04 - the site
30:39 - I wonder if it's like that with
30:40 - everything if I'm not getting family
30:47 - okay so Roboto is it's here it's just
30:52 - not being applied here for some reason
31:04 - okay let me I'm about halfway through
31:08 - the stream for today so I do want to go
31:11 - to the live chat just just quickly and
31:14 - see if there are any questions or you
31:16 - know any new people to welcome before I
31:19 - solve this this font problem
31:34 - Oh Sean says connections really laggy so
31:38 - yeah sorry about that
32:00 - okay Patrick sing there's there's more
32:06 - to flow text than what I'm copying so
32:09 - let me check did I maybe I missed maybe
32:17 - I missed some stuff here
32:33 - I mean maybe I should pull in some of
32:38 - the baseline font stuff
32:58 - okay I'm not
33:01 - maybe I'm missing it
33:07 - yeah maybe I had thought that maybe the
33:10 - base font is different so then all those
33:14 - the flow tax classes and the media
33:18 - queries would be slightly off from what
33:20 - I'm used to
33:22 - [Music]
33:28 - bill says have you thought of using
33:31 - styled components yes I have thought of
33:34 - using the style components so I'm gonna
33:38 - look into that I would actually like to
33:41 - make each of the components completely
33:44 - self-contained if I could so say that
33:48 - could be a goal for this project because
33:51 - then I'd like to be able to just reuse
33:52 - them
33:54 - it'd be cool actually to make like Kevin
33:58 - had made the letterhead card it would be
34:02 - cool to just make card component which I
34:08 - mean they already have the card
34:09 - component so I'd have to call it
34:10 - something different it could be card but
34:12 - basically a component that would be like
34:14 - it would have the card there but you
34:17 - could control everything in it just
34:20 - through props and then that way I could
34:24 - reuse that for all my projects just
34:28 - control and what I mean by what's in it
34:29 - like whether or not it has an image at
34:32 - the top a title and overlay text action
34:36 - buttons so all of that would be in props
34:39 - and maybe I'm missing something and
34:41 - that's how material UI is already set up
34:43 - and trying to reinvent it here but I
34:47 - think that would be really versatile and
34:49 - especially since I use cards and pretty
34:51 - much everything that I do that would be
34:54 - a component that would be awesome that
34:56 - make that completely self-contained with
34:58 - everything that it needs to render and
35:01 - just be able to drop it into any project
35:07 - I just see Rowan asked about what the
35:11 - issue was yesterday with the project and
35:15 - I CEO told him that it was Internet
35:17 - Explorer 9 yeah this is terrible
35:25 - Blake asks what is docker docker is like
35:30 - a weighted like like you make a
35:34 - container and your program can run in
35:38 - that container and you can transfer that
35:39 - container so and I mean like everything
35:41 - can run like your entire setup the whole
35:44 - stack can be in this container and it
35:49 - can be copied exactly on to anybody's
35:52 - machine no matter what they're running
35:53 - and it's supposed to be able to run in
35:56 - exactly the same way and you don't even
35:58 - have to install all the same stuff on
36:00 - your machine but if you're running
36:02 - something in node and you didn't have
36:04 - node installed on your machine it
36:05 - wouldn't matter if you had docker and
36:07 - you downloaded the the container then
36:10 - you should be able to run it so that's
36:12 - my understanding of docker I haven't
36:14 - used it in at least a year I would start
36:19 - I wanted to use it more and I just got
36:21 - busy with things and never felt
36:23 - comfortable enough with it to use it for
36:26 - you know in production
36:40 - i Patrick had some and and Bill had some
36:45 - good explanation as well for for docker
36:48 - basically saying it's like like a
36:51 - virtual machine yeah so said it's like
36:57 - like a lightweight virtual machine
37:13 - nice Emily arsenal of color aquatics
37:18 - says come on guys thumbs up this yeah
37:22 - cool give it a thumbs up if you want I
37:24 - don't I mean it's cool when your thumbs
37:27 - up that but I don't really know if
37:29 - thumbs up mean it means much in terms of
37:34 - of anything I don't really know how that
37:39 - that helps other than letting me know
37:41 - that you like the video though they
37:48 - sebastian saying mature you i was
37:51 - designed with Roboto font mine so be
37:53 - sure to include it your project
37:54 - where is that look over
38:18 - okay Patrick said I did get all of the
38:21 - flow tech stuff so cool so Sebastian I'm
38:26 - let me go back so we're working on
38:29 - trying to get Roboto to be the font for
38:32 - for this which I'm it's already being
38:36 - applied to like H tags and I'm not sure
38:39 - why it's not being applied to these P
38:41 - tags at least inspected again yeah so
38:47 - you can see like on our P tags here it's
38:50 - it's saying that our font is just saying
38:52 - serif so I'm not exactly sure what the
38:55 - problem is and why we're not getting you
38:57 - know on the same page you know some
38:59 - things have that fun some things don't
39:03 - so I may just have to import the fonts
39:13 - in one of my main CSS files actually
39:19 - here's the thing I'm not sure about we
39:21 - can test it out but if one of you knows
39:23 - it'll save us a few minutes if I put in
39:28 - different CSS files so it's obviously
39:30 - any importing that font in photo Roboto
39:34 - exists already somewhere material UI and
39:36 - it's already being imported if I try to
39:38 - import it again in another CSS file will
39:40 - the browser know that and not bother
39:42 - bringing it in again or will try to
39:45 - bring it in twice that's that sounds
39:48 - weak the only I mean possibly if if
39:52 - there are different locations that it
39:53 - was getting it from it might think it
39:56 - was two different files but right it
39:58 - shouldn't try to pull it in again
40:00 - right so I know there's a delay so it'll
40:06 - be a minute before you all hear that and
40:08 - can answer so I guess in the meantime
40:12 - just to prepare I can look up okay so
40:18 - this font
40:22 -  what a thinner bottle a regular
40:25 - medium bowl I don't know that I need all
40:31 - of these whoops okay so
40:44 - I rarely use bold or medium so I'm
40:53 - definitely not gonna use bold it's
40:55 - possible that if I want something to be
40:56 - bolded I'll use medium so I will grab
40:58 - that cuz not I think about it there's
41:00 - might be some stuff that's boated and
41:05 - then I do use I do like to use some of
41:10 - the thinner stuff if I can on some
41:13 - monitors though it's really hard to read
41:16 - the thin stuff so it definitely has to
41:19 - be a large font for thin to work so
41:24 - let's bring that and let me check this
41:29 - see this
41:35 - okay Sebastian says it's inherited but
41:40 - not using their about a font Roland says
41:43 - it's from the same if it's from the same
41:44 - source it's won't if it's different
41:46 - location versions it will try okay
41:52 - but since it's already imported you can
41:54 - just use Roboto
41:56 - actually I I want to see what's being
41:58 - imported let's see what let's check it
42:04 - out here see where it's coming from or
42:12 - might be easier just to check here wow
42:17 - that's a lot of stuff that when you
42:24 - refresh this page I don't want to see
42:26 - all this
42:34 - okay you know what maybe I won't be able
42:39 - to see it
42:47 - okay
42:53 - I do want to see though if I before I
43:03 - pull in all the font stuff if I just go
43:06 - into this responsive text new flow Tex
43:27 - are we getting robot enough
43:35 - here we go we've got Roboto now okay
43:38 - cool
43:40 - so anyway thanks you said that so I
43:47 - think it was some of the Sebastian said
43:50 - that made me want to do that instead so
43:52 - thank you
43:54 - oh yeah and Roland's mentioned since the
43:59 - age tags are using it it's obviously
44:01 - imported already so that should be
44:05 - that'll work
44:06 - I mean maybe maybe I could put in one of
44:11 - the CSS files I'm not gonna worry about
44:14 - it right now I just want to get this
44:15 - page done but in one of the CSS files
44:18 - maybe I will put just like globally like
44:22 - everything gets Roboto one of the ones
44:25 - that I import into the app.js file okay
44:30 - cool so that's it now like I said I'm
44:34 - still not sure I'm just not sure about
44:41 - the size I mean maybe I maybe it just
44:43 - looks weird because on my other screen
44:44 - I'm looking at the really small size so
44:46 - this is what I'm looking at and it's
44:48 - like a huge difference so maybe that's
44:53 - just the kind of the weirdness that I'm
44:55 - but I'm getting here all right but I do
44:59 - want to before we end today I want to
45:03 - throw in some some fields some form
45:06 - field so let's check out the fields
45:24 - sexy oh so okay so which one there we go
45:28 - I want the floating label that's what we
45:31 - have now so I need two text fields and
45:35 - then a multi-line with the floating
45:38 - label okay so first things first let's
45:46 - import text field
46:01 - get that semicolon out of here I don't
46:08 - care if you all use semicolons but I
46:10 - just now that I'm not using them anymore
46:12 - I can't stand them
46:15 - let's see floating label there we go
46:29 - let's pull that in we're gonna need to
46:32 - make a little container for that so we
46:35 - want that to be 50% with so we're gonna
46:37 - get class and that's gonna be six okay
46:57 - so with the : classes that we brought in
46:58 - from materialize the materialized CSS
47:01 - framework this means on small screens
47:05 - it's going to take up 12 columns which
47:07 - means full width and then on medium
47:10 - sized screens it's only going to take up
47:11 - 6 so it's going to be 50% width and then
47:16 - we're gonna put our text field in and we
47:21 - need two of those so and put that there
47:25 - and then we need a full width multi-line
47:35 - text input
47:42 - and yet we want the floating they were
47:44 - one
48:03 - so actually I want to try let's see
48:09 - don't want to try this I want to try
48:11 - this I'm just curious
48:15 - oops now I meant to put another column
48:29 - let's see how this turns out
48:39 - that doesn't
48:41 - at this I'm gonna get rid of the hint
48:43 - text obviously I don't want the hint
48:45 - text but why is this this big there must
48:52 - be some sort of max max length set okay
49:00 - so that does stack like we wanted to so
49:06 - the thing I was saying I wanted to try
49:08 - out is not to make another row and just
49:10 - to put all these and my my reasoning was
49:14 - if I put another row it's gonna add in a
49:16 - margin and then it's gonna look Auton
49:20 - small screens so there won't be a
49:22 - uniform spacing between here so that's
49:25 - why I did it like that and I because I
49:27 - had noticed that that's how Kevin did it
49:30 - when he refactored the letterhead page
49:37 - all right so let's check this out to see
49:40 - if it has a max width
49:51 - or I guess just a width where is it
49:55 - getting this width from okay so that's
49:58 - saying a hundred percent so at some
50:01 - point it's gotta be setting a width
50:11 - I mean what'd you leave this over a bit
50:16 - second you see
50:39 - okay yeah this yeah that element with
50:44 - here is controlling that so let me check
50:51 - the docs see if I can just change it in
50:55 - here because I I want it to be like here
50:58 - I do have it full full width and that's
51:06 - how I want it to be
51:23 - fully there we go let's add four with
51:30 - true
51:49 - I wonder if I just add it if it'll if
51:52 - it'll go true let's see I think it might
51:55 - yet there you go so that's that's the
51:59 - answer it we just have to add full width
52:01 - which is awesome so full width now let's
52:16 - check it out
52:18 - awesome ok so we have our full width
52:21 - going on okay not bad I think on the
52:29 - other as it is now on the site it
52:33 - definitely has a bit more padding but
52:36 - I'm not I'm not super worried about it
52:44 - okay cool so let's add in let's get rid
52:50 - of the hint text and then we'll add in a
52:52 - button and time is it and then we'll uh
52:54 - then we'll wrap things up a hint text
53:13 - there we go cool this is just I don't
53:18 - know if you all can see this but it
53:20 - looks like it's just not quite as smooth
53:23 - like the animation for this bar it's not
53:26 - quite as smooth as I have it actually
53:31 - that's because on the only other thing
53:33 - that's it so I'm not actually trying to
53:36 - do like the the really cool animation
53:38 - that they have here where it actually
53:40 - expands and shrinks so that's that's why
53:45 - there's I think I was just adding a
53:51 - different color and and weight of border
53:57 - okay cool let's find our buttons
54:10 - amazing
54:13 - raise fun yeah this is what I want so I
54:20 - just wanted to say submit really to just
54:24 - need a simple simple button that says
54:28 - submit and we do want it to be the
54:31 - primary color so let's import this
54:37 - button and then we'll bring in this
54:46 - raised primary put it
55:10 - all right he's fun
55:20 - so it's
55:25 - style is not defined yeah okay what's we
55:33 - missed something then style margin 12
55:39 - all right I'm not gonna worry about that
55:41 - right now let's just take out the style
55:42 - and see how it looks and then we can put
55:46 - our own margins in if we need to okay
55:49 - cool so
56:01 - actually
56:07 - I'm gonna compare this okay so this is
56:10 - my current effect I don't think they're
56:16 - the same oops
56:26 - okay I may change change how this is
56:31 - working because I don't like it as much
56:35 - as this
56:36 - I'm gonna check I'm gonna have to check
56:38 - the material design guidelines on this
56:40 - just to see but I mean this is I didn't
56:46 - build this a while ago but I'm assuming
56:48 - that I followed what was with
56:49 - materialized CSS for this effect and you
56:53 - can see there they're definitely
56:54 - different so in terms of I mean yes
56:57 - there's a color change and then a slight
57:00 - increase in the shadow to make it appear
57:03 - like it's coming forward but you can see
57:05 - like the increase in the shadow is
57:07 - barely noticeable actually now that I
57:11 - look at I'm not even sure that's
57:12 - happening and I'm not sure yeah this is
57:20 - happening faster it seems like there's
57:23 - not there's not as much of a transition
57:29 - okay so yeah I'll have to work on that
57:31 - button because I just it's not as
57:34 - satisfying hovering over that button as
57:36 - this button I don't know maybe it's just
57:38 - me but but realistically like if I need
57:42 - if I want to keep a consistent brand
57:44 - standard then we need to have the same
57:46 - thing so I'm gonna need to change how
57:49 - this button works then to be consistent
57:51 - with what we're doing across all our
57:53 - sites okay
58:02 - so I think that's it so basically this
58:06 - page is layouts done just need to change
58:09 - change some text work on this button a
58:12 - bit and that's pretty much it
58:15 - I'll probably didn't do it like a
58:17 - comparison to make sure that you know
58:20 - these this font size is correct I just
58:24 - wanna see what the base font size is for
58:26 - material you either this is going off of
58:30 - alright let me go to the live chat I'm
58:34 - gonna go through quickly and hey one of
58:40 - my co-workers is in Iceland right now
58:41 - and she just was watching the live chat
58:45 - and sent a message said hello from
58:47 - Iceland glad you're working hard so I'm
58:51 - not even seriously still watching enough
58:53 - but that was cool
59:01 - alright so I'm gonna scroll up I'll try
59:04 - to get through everything but I do need
59:06 - you know in a few minutes I'll need to
59:08 - end the stream
59:09 - hey we ended up getting about 50 we're
59:12 - up to we're up to 49 viewers now so
59:15 - that's not bad
59:15 - I was I was a bit worried no one would
59:17 - watch because it was at a different time
59:22 - let me scroll down yeah if you have any
59:25 - questions you throw them in a live chat
59:27 - but I am I won't have a lot of time to
59:30 - answer so if I can't get to him you just
59:32 - send them to me on Twitter and I will
59:34 - say I know that some of you have asked
59:37 - me to look over your code and send me
59:40 - messages and I've just been really busy
59:42 - lately so hopefully I have some time
59:44 - this weekend to check it out but just
59:48 - please be a little bit patient with me
59:51 - and I'll try I'll try to get to it
60:11 - okay let's see
60:20 - Rowen says it's too much text together
60:22 - so yeah now that it's a bigger font it
60:26 - does look like it's too much text so
60:30 - yeah we'll see we'll see what to do that
60:33 - I there's a good chance that some of the
60:36 - the text will change when everybody you
60:43 - know kind of reviews this again and so
60:46 - we might be able to get rid of of some
60:48 - of that text rohan says I'm partial to
60:53 - semicolons just feels complete to me I
60:55 - did it was weird not using semicolons at
60:58 - first it felt the same way but now it's
61:00 - you know it just looks nicer without
61:02 - them
61:15 - breath mesh as hey friends can I get a
61:19 - job if I do full stack developing and
61:22 - free code camp yeah I mean you you can
61:29 - there there are people that have
61:32 - definitely gotten jobs after doing free
61:33 - code camp so it just kind of depends on
61:36 - the quality of your work and you know
61:40 - how many places you apply to what
61:41 - they're looking for there's just so many
61:42 - factors that go into actually getting a
61:44 - job that I couldn't say for sure you're
61:46 - gonna get a job with free code camp but
61:48 - it's definitely gonna help you and help
61:51 - you increase your skills and you know
61:54 - the more skills you have the better your
61:55 - portfolio is the better chance that you
61:57 - do have of getting a job
62:06 - Oh Sebastian I see you saw a full-width
62:09 - before I did so thanks for that sorry I
62:12 - didn't then look over and see that
62:30 - now Patrick says why is the bottom field
62:32 - so different than the other to look
62:34 - where the blinking cursor ends up on the
62:36 - bottom once it's active yeah it's
62:44 - because it's a multi-line field that's
62:50 - why so it's it's multi-line and it's
62:52 - currently set to two two rows so if I
62:58 - really wanted it to be uniform I guess I
63:00 - could set it to one row and I'm assuming
63:04 - it would expand actually now I want to I
63:13 - want to make sure that it expands yeah
63:16 - okay to expand yeah I don't I guess I
63:25 - don't mind that I'm used to that but if
63:29 - it'll look better we could always just
63:30 - set it to initially just only in one
63:32 - column I just want people to know that
63:35 - they can type a lot in here if they need
63:37 - to oh and I just see Patrick already got
63:45 - his answer in their live shot so thanks
63:49 - thanks Sebastian for forgiving that
63:53 - answer nobody said today e-string barely
63:57 - yeah I did I'm not gonna be in the
63:59 - office later on when my normally
64:01 - streamed so I had to do a an early
64:03 - stream but it might not be bad maybe
64:06 - some people who because of the time
64:08 - difference and things couldn't see the
64:10 - later stream maybe they can't see it so
64:13 - so I guess that's you know that's kind
64:15 - of cool and says would you recommend the
64:23 - beta version of free code camp or the
64:25 - other one and do you have any idea when
64:28 - the beta version will be released I have
64:30 - no idea when it'll be released
64:32 - and I I have no recommendation when
64:36 - we're another because I haven't gone
64:38 - through the beta version yet so I
64:40 - wouldn't I wouldn't feel comfortable
64:41 - giving a recommendation I'll just say
64:44 - you're gonna learn a lot no matter what
64:48 - if if you're a little bit more
64:50 - adventurous and want to are going to be
64:54 - okay if like something's a little bit
64:55 - buggy then I'd say go for the beta
64:57 - version if you're the type of person
64:59 - that gets really mad when something
65:00 - doesn't work right then stick with the
65:03 - regular version because you know
65:06 - obviously it's a beta so there's gonna
65:08 - be things that don't work right so
65:10 - that's that's my my advice
65:23 - some talk talk about my editor it is
65:27 - Adam it is the SETI theme SETI yes it
65:31 - does look similar to sublime Jay rec
65:35 - says what age did you actually start
65:36 - working as a dev okay let me let me
65:41 - think I'm gonna have to do some math in
65:43 - my head here I also say this I got paid
65:50 - to build websites when I was I don't
65:56 - know like 18 was probably the first time
65:59 - I ever got paid to do a website
66:01 - somewhere around there so but I
66:04 - definitely didn't consider myself a
66:06 - developer at that time so I would
66:12 - probably say let me think how old am i
66:15 - right now 30
66:16 - I think I'm 31 right I'm 31 maybe around
66:24 - 28 I'd say I probably wouldn't really
66:30 - consider myself a dev until I was around
66:34 - 28 and at that point I was freelancing I
66:36 - think I was freelancing for a little
66:39 - while before that but it was mostly like
66:43 - stuff you wouldn't really consider being
66:45 - a dad like I don't like customizing
66:48 - WordPress themes like basic CSS
66:50 - customizations to a wordpress theme to
66:52 - me I don't necessarily consider that
66:56 - being deaf work I didn't consider dead
66:57 - work when I did it before so so whenever
67:02 - I was doing that I you know I I was
67:06 - getting paid to do web site stuff but
67:08 - real dead word probably I was maybe 28
67:11 - somewhere around there give or take a
67:13 - year so actually occasionally I see
67:19 - people say something like I'm already 20
67:21 - years old and I don't have a job and as
67:24 - a developer and like they're freaking
67:26 - out so don't worry about it don't worry
67:32 - really so
67:36 - yeah okay so DeMar DeMar key how I'm not
67:43 - sure how to pronounce that pronounce
67:45 - your name so let me know if I'm
67:46 - pronouncing it wrong but De Marchi Allen
67:49 - says I'm 23 with good practice could I
67:52 - get where you are definitely definitely
67:54 - for sure so when I was 23 I was I think
68:03 - I might have been a waiter at the time
68:05 - all right and then I taught high school
68:09 - okay demarcus okay I was like thinking
68:13 - it would be like the French
68:15 - pronunciation but Demark is cool
68:18 - sorry for mispronouncing it so yeah so
68:24 - anyway though let me give you just a
68:25 - brief timeline I actually did a video
68:27 - explaining like my timeline on my own
68:29 - channel so if you check out the link in
68:31 - the description of my channel I did a
68:34 - video on like how I became a friend of
68:36 - dev that'll give you a better idea of
68:37 - just like how long it took me to learn
68:39 - things so but basically when I was
68:44 - around let me think
68:47 - so I graduated with a business degree in
68:49 - 2008 I couldn't find a job for like six
68:53 - months I worked as a manager at a Burger
68:56 - King and then I quit that job and I
68:59 - worked as a waiter at a restaurant and
69:01 - then I got offered a job as a high
69:04 - school teacher so I took it because it
69:08 - was in my hometown I really wanted to
69:09 - move back so I took that job and I
69:11 - taught I actually taught Latin and
69:14 - religion at a high school for almost
69:17 - four years then I quit that job and I
69:22 - traded money on the stock market for a
69:24 - little while until I ran out of money
69:26 - and then so obviously I stopped doing
69:29 - that and I looked for work for a couple
69:31 - of months couldn't find anything and
69:33 - then finally I've started doing website
69:36 - stuff and for I say probably the first
69:38 - year of doing that I would not have
69:41 - considered myself a dev it was mostly
69:43 - like search engine optimization work
69:45 - writing blogs do making minor
69:48 - CSS changes so I was definitely in my
69:53 - late 20s before I really started to try
69:56 - to learn how to be a dev so basically
70:00 - within within the last like three years
70:05 - maybe four years I've gotten to this
70:08 - point because before that my knowledge
70:10 - of development was really like basic
70:16 - yeah no I didn't I did not have a formal
70:20 - degree my degree is in business with a
70:22 - specialization in banking finance and
70:25 - economics not related to web development
70:30 - although good to know
70:31 - it's it's good to know how to handle
70:33 - money and and run businesses and things
70:35 - but yeah so basically my point is I
70:46 - think you can definitely pick up web
70:50 - development and really quickly get to
70:53 - the point where you're good enough to
70:55 - make that really nice site it's really
70:57 - good thing so for me it actually took a
71:00 - couple of years but I had kids and you
71:03 - know at a family I was trying to make
71:04 - money so I was taking a bunch of you
71:06 - know I was taking work doing anything
71:07 - like during that time of me learning I
71:09 - was taking work you know doing
71:13 - landscaping at people's houses painting
71:15 - I'd like paint their basement I would
71:19 - take work like that were just writing
71:22 - writing blogs and things like that so I
71:25 - was taking work doing anything I could
71:27 - to provide for my family so I couldn't
71:33 - dedicate all my time to learning so if
71:35 - you did have time to dedicate to
71:37 - learning you could probably learn way
71:41 - faster and get better than me way faster
71:46 - so don't don't be discouraged at your
71:49 - current age it's just if you have the
71:53 - the desire and the talent and and the
71:56 - time to put into it you can definitely
71:59 - learn this stuff I'm not saying it's
72:01 - easy
72:02 - takes work but you can you can learn it
72:15 - alright so I'm gonna take maybe like two
72:18 - more questions and then I'm gonna I'm
72:21 - gonna wrap it up okay let's see I missed
72:26 - this question so DeMarcus asked and do
72:28 - you consider real dev work to be working
72:30 - from scratch I wouldn't say from scratch
72:32 - but the reason I say that about
72:35 - WordPress is a lot of the customizations
72:37 - you can do in WordPress come like just
72:39 - through their admin interface so you
72:41 - don't even interact at all with with
72:43 - code necessarily so that's why I kind of
72:49 - didn't really consider myself doing dev
72:51 - work I would say you don't have to start
72:53 - from scratch because really who starts
72:55 - from scratch right even you know you set
72:57 - up a project you install a bunch of node
72:59 - modules and there's stuff in there that
73:00 - you know there's already been thousands
73:03 - of hours of work put into you know what
73:05 - you're doing just from your build tools
73:07 - alone so no one starts from scratch but
73:11 - I think the ability to go in and build a
73:15 - site using HTML CSS JavaScript actually
73:20 - being able to write the code at that
73:22 - point I would say that's your developer
73:26 - if you can't do that then I don't know
73:32 - that that I don't know that I would call
73:34 - myself a developer I know people are
73:35 - different definitions and but if I
73:38 - wasn't able to go in and in a code
73:41 - editor and put out a website you know
73:45 - just with the you know basic markup then
73:48 - I wouldn't be I wouldn't feel
73:49 - comfortable calling myself a developer
73:55 - so hopefully that helps I don't want to
73:57 - offend anybody who who does WordPress
73:59 - theme customization it's you can make a
74:02 - lot of money in that and it's definitely
74:04 - needed but that's just how I felt when I
74:08 - was doing it
74:13 - DeMarcus s what are your thoughts on
74:14 - bootstrap yeah I think bootstraps great
74:18 - I think that's a great way it takes care
74:21 - of a lot of really basic stuff in CSS
74:23 - that in my opinion is a waste of time to
74:26 - do yourself I mean it may be like once
74:28 - just to see how it is and I'm thinking
74:31 - mainly like like a grid system you know
74:34 - all the different kind of things you
74:36 - need to make things work properly across
74:39 - browsers so things like that like nobody
74:42 - codes that by hand so that's really
74:47 - really useful so I think bootstrap is
74:50 - good to know there's a lot of places use
74:51 - bootstrap as well Jay says what
74:59 - resources are using to learn this stuff
75:01 - yeah free code camp YouTube videos
75:07 - courses on Udacity all right DeMarcus
75:13 - said great advice Jesse just subject
75:16 - channel so thanks Hank I'm glad you like
75:18 - the advice and thanks for subscribing to
75:20 - my channel as well yeah I hope that
75:24 - helps I thought I saw one more question
75:27 - that I missed but now I can't find it so
75:30 - sorry I okay here it is it was a
75:36 - question about angular four are you
75:38 - gonna cover anything like this for
75:39 - angular for I don't have any plans to
75:41 - cover angular right now I'm not ruling
75:43 - it out for the future but I have no
75:45 - plans at this point to do anything with
75:47 - angular so yeah thanks for watching
75:51 - everyone and I'll see you on Monday and
75:54 - it was great thanks for adapting to the
75:58 - difference in time I appreciate your
76:01 - being so flexible and yeah
76:06 - so have a great weekend

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jessie and good morning if you're in my timezone or near there so this is a lot earlier than I normally stream but we all get here at the University we all get pretty much everybody gets to go home at at noon today because there's a big conference going on and they need the parking spaces for the people attending the conference so we all have to leave so still wanted to do a stream so we're gonna do one it's gonna have to be a short stream though because I I knew I had a meeting at 1130 but I had completely forgot that there was also a goingaway party for somebody that works here in the same building as I do at 1100 so I'd like to I'd like to stop into that cuz he's a really nice guy so I like to be able to say goodbye to him before before he leaves so I I was just in the middle of reviewing pool requests so kevin has submitted to pool requests they both look really good i am i've already merged one and i was just kind of testing the the second one and this is kevin AKA kevie and 60 20 in the in the chat so i'm not sure if he's in the chat or not i expect this is going to be a smaller audience since it's a totally different time and I didn't even post it on on Twitter or anything like til I don't maybe a half hour ago probably not even that long ago so hey everybody there are a few people and the chat is picking up a little bit okay so I'm just gonna finish up just checking this out I'm looking at it there's no you know don't see any errors other than our normal errors that we get so it's looking good so basically what what Kevin did was the first thing he did was refactor the side nav so there's nothing visible that happened but behind the scenes there's a lot of code that it was kind of removed moving around and so it makes it a lot more a lot more streamlined and now for the letterhead he's made it so that it's basically let me show you the code first I guess let me get rid of this and open it up again okay cool so we have the letterhead card now and that's its component here so basically he's before remember we had just copied and pasted everything which was okay just to see how the layout looks but you don't want to leave it like that so kevin was completely right in refactoring this into its own component and now let me go back to the letterhead there we go so now you know we just have you know the letterhead here and it's since there's not a lot of them it's okay like this and I probably won't make it any smaller than this but we probably could just loop over this and we could take these props and put them in an array and then we could just loop over that array so we would just do like a red dot map and put all the cards you know in here like that so that could be a further customization that we could further optimization that we could do but I don't know for is not really a big deal to me if it were closer to like 10 then yeah I'm definitely making I'm gonna make an array and look through it alright so this looks good I'm just gonna check on my other screen I have the I'll pull this over in case you haven't seen it before this shows this is the pull request pull request 10 and this is just showing the difference between it so the letterhead card is entirely new so you see this stuff on the left hand side is how it was and then on the right hand side this is how it is now after the changes from the pull request so before we didn't have it at all and now this is in the air and this all looks good and then letterhead has changed you can see you know able to remove a lot of this stuff because now it's in letterhead card also able to remove a lot of that into that repetition of all that markup replaced with letterhead called card so that looks good I'm going to merge that also let me let me paste in the address for the end Rock server so I'm gonna paste that into the live chat and let me bring it over in case you can't see what's in the live chat it's this highlight highlighted bit right here if you can see the site as as we're working on it and inspect it with dev tools and a lot nicer than having to wait for me to click on something for you to check it out also I do have the the stream open on Instagram as well so let's get started and okay I just checked the live chat so Taylor asked just 31 persons here yeah it's just because it's in such a different time than I normally do and there I didn't give a lot of notice with either the YouTube alert or with my Twitter my tweet about it alright Zanna Zanna has to go she's going on a trip and she's got it for Paris so thanks for checking in have a great time on on your trip okay let's get started so hopefully now if you want to see this you've gotten that now we're going to merge this in so I've actually merged the master branch into this this branch that I pulled on for testing which is the pull request ten so I've already merged into that just to test it with everything and make sure it all works properly and I do want to doublecheck one more thing before I merge this and that was the side nav so I want to make sure yeah I was afraid of this that this might be the case let me jump back mmhmm okay on my other screen I'm comparing that last I just wanted to make sure that when I did the merge that nothing got messed up with the last pull request number nine that I had merged in and so I just wanted to check what it should have looked like so let me let me look at this is sine MF yeah maybe this just to say okay maybe it is all right I thought I'd seen something that didn't look right but right now that I'm comparing it it looks looks about the same as it should yeah okay cool everything looks good so I'm gonna check out master branch I'm just gonna do like a basic merge I know we had we tried out different ways to merge things it in a previous stream what's this letter I'm just gonna do a really basic merge here and not go through so there's a look basically the reason I said that is there's a lot of options for how you merge and what happens when the merge goes in so you know the most basic is just merge but there's a lot of other things you can do with that all right also another thing that was added in pull requests 10 from Kevin was that the random images in fact they're random you know for each each card now which I mentioned yesterday uh I like that and that's really cool also this is fixed so before we had uneven spacing so between the first two cards we had no padding at all and we had a pretty good amount here probably double with this is and then no padding again so now that that problem is fixed so looking good let's move on now and we're gonna do is share a story yeah this is where we left off yesterday with shared story and I'll bring up the mean Logan even show you oh I also I forgot to tell you what what happened so yesterday I left you all and I had to go check out somebody's computer so it turns out the problem so basically the person could not access my website he was saying that there was just a blank screen and this has been going on like for a long time and other people from the IT department had tried to check it out and and couldn't figure out what's going on so my suspicion was correct I suspected that he was just using an old browser and he was he was trying to open it in Internet Explorer 9 and didn't realize it so you know the user was you know basically not yeah he's not really into computers so he didn't realize what was happening but he he assumed that it was opening the link automatically in Chrome because that's what he normally used but the default browser on his machine was set to Internet Explorer 9 so that there was a lot of confusion I think from that because he was you know saying and thinking that it was in chrome where it should have worked not realizing that it was Internet Explorer 9 and some people had checked out his computer before and told him that his browsers were uptodate so he assumed they were uptodate as well so I don't know if they just meant chrome is uptodate and didn't bother with Internet Explorer because they didn't think anybody would use it but in reality like Internet Explorer 9 that's pretty old I believe that came out in 2011 so really old so anyway I was i I was a little bit I'm relieved that it wasn't my project it wasn't my fault but I feel bad for this for this person because there was important information that was being conveyed through that that site and he couldn't get it for months he hasn't been able to get it and so I feel really bad about it and he was legitimately angry about the situation and I can't blame him I just wish he hadn't been angry at me since it wasn't really my fault but the unreality based on everything that he was saying and been told it seemed like it was my it was my issue so in fact he had actually been told by other people that it was it was on my end it's my excuse though so anyway I can't be mad at him I was a little bit upset about the whole situation in general of like why are we still have Internet Explorer 9 on computers and here so anyway but now I'm uh I'm over it I was I was mad for a little bit but now I'm cool so anyway just want to say that because I know you all had some of you had said at the end of yesterday's stream that you wanted the update so there's the update while Patrick says in the live chat end of support for Internet Explorer 9 was a year and a half ago Wow Wow I did forward on so I I wrote several emails to various people about what happened and I'm I'm trying to get the browser's updated or like at the very least I wouldn't care if they just deleted Internet Explorer off everybody's computers that would be fine with me too because why would you need everybody seems to have chrome on campus anyway so anyway it's not really you know my department's responsibility or my call at all I don't actually have any access to update anyone's browser even even if I wanted to so I can't really fix that but hopefully you know we'll be able to get that fixed at some point because this is not the only time that's happened some people somebody was using a really old version of Safari once and that's why my site didn't work some people continually try to log in with Firefox 3 from somewhere on campus and I can't figure out who it is because my my error tracking setup for that site also tells me their email addresses but the code can't even run the part where it grabs their email address so it gets held up even before that so I can get an IP address but I don't I don't have any ability to figure out whose IP that is so anyway enough of that hopefully I won't have to handle too many of those situations again and oops form we're gonna go to suggest a story form okay so for this form we're just gonna have some paragraphs and some form elements we decided yesterday that we were not gonna put this on a card we're gonna try to put it you know directly onto the paper and we're gonna make this font a larger size and we'll see how that looks so let me move this off to the other screen and first thing first things first let's just make a container where we got the story I thought I named it okay so let's copy some some some of the markup over from let's see posters letterhead would actually be good to copy it from because we have some P tags up at the top of the letterhead just like we'll have with this okay so I'm just gonna grab this whole container and then we'll remove what we don't need that this will save us a little bit of time typing and now we don't need to see that and we can get rid of this and I'm just gonna leave these paragraphs here because that's fine for now I don't I know how paragraphs are gonna act what I'm really worried about those I want to make sure that we get the right font size here so I am gonna pull in from materialize the responsive font so I let's see if we still have this open I think we do yep so we still have our materialized CSS file open from their github repo so I'm gonna find the the font so it's it's flow text it's not a font this is just the fontweight so you can see I'm sorry not the phone what I guess it does set the font way but the font size so you can see a different screen sizes the font size will change so there's a bunch of media queries so obviously like I'm not gonna spend my time rewriting all these media queries right so we're just gonna take this and put this in our CSS file and I'm just gonna take this for now it might be helpful to have some of these other kind of helper classes at some point but I'd rather bring in what I need because sometimes at the end of the project you never go back in and remove all the stuff you don't need so I'm not gonna copy everything in right now I'm gonna try to be a little bit more responsible about it I know the last project there was a bit of a mess in the CSS and I just ran out of time and didn't get to clean it up so don't want that to happen this time so I'm just gonna put this in the do we want to do this yeah this is I'm gonna put this in a separate file for now I think I'd like to keep my CSS in different files yeah and then that'll help keep it a little bit more clean so let's make another file or another yes I already made this aw I was thinking I'd make another directory but I think I already made it so I think we just need to touch source styles yep that's it and we'll name this all right and I'm naming it float X because that's the name of the class so I I'm immediately gonna know what that is I guess if you haven't worked with materialize you might not know what that is but at least you'll know maybe I should change it then because I do want people you know down the road to be able to look at this and see what's going on so we'll call responsive responsive text okay yeah that's a little bit more descriptive of what it what it is oops and I almost misspelled this so I didn't mean to say tough I wanted to say touch so touch is how you create a file in the command line okay now we can see that we have this file if I open up a folder here we should have that file what happened to this should be there right source styles oh I just didn't see it how did I not see that I think I was I was thinking that it would have showed up green since I just added it so that's why I didn't even bother reading it which I don't know why I didn't show up bringing normally new brand new files do appear as being green so not not really sure what's going on with that but we can finally copy this in and let's save that and then we'll bring in I'm probably gonna end up using this will it use this everywhere actually I won't use this everywhere so there are gonna be some pages where I won't even need this because we're gonna have we're not really gonna have blocks of text so I don't know that I need to pull this into every page let me check oh I have it on the other screen isolettes let's just check quickly because I think we can try to yeah I'm not I don't actually want it on this page I want to keep control of exactly what these sizes are on the home page same thing with this page and this page of text yeah and yeah the the text inside of cards I'd rather keep more control over the size just because I do want to make sure that we have cards that are the same height and I don't want to be huge if I applied the flow tech stuff in the cards that they would be really big so yeah so some of the like these pages obviously I could apply it to but yeah so my whole point point is like I don't want to have to load CSS in places where I'm not going to use it so here's what we're gonna do so we can see like on apt ass we're importing our Styles up at the top so I'm just gonna copy that and paste it into story and change this to responsive text okay now we should be able to put I should be able to put flow class or float X class here and it'll just apply to all these paragraph tags so let's see if that is the case oh okay I see let me oops you need to go out and back inside let's try this okay cool if you didn't catch that so initially I just had one dot which would have meant from where this is so from the views folder it was trying to find within the views folder a Styles folder okay which obviously is not the case okay so it worked when I had it like that within App dodge' ass because app Taj is is here within the source folder so what I had to do was put another dot and that's saying go up one level right so go to the source folder then try to look for the Styles folder so be aware if you're moving components into other other directories within your project that you may have to change some of this stuff depending on how how you've done it how are your projects set up so at some point we're gonna make a components folder and move some things into there and we'll have to take care of that when we do that as well so all right but for now it's just what we want so we have this it actually ends it's pretty large fonts you had a fonts pretty large now this is larger blocks of text then that will have so actually I think I'm going to bring in the the real text because I would like to see now that we have the the flow text applied I want to see what this would really look like so you can see it's not nearly as much the second one's going to be a bit longer and bring this in okay so this is the actual text something just looks weird to me about this what what is wrong with this I'm no does that look odd to anyone like it it just doesn't look as nice as maybe there's some conflicting styles between material you I and this bed yeah maybe that's it oh maybe it's the font am i not all right said saying the font family is just saying serif which is not what I want maybe that's what I wanted to be rubato which I thought Roboto was the default for for material UI maybe I missed a step and I have to actually pull in Roboto at some point let's check let's check on that because I'm not really gonna know if this looks good and unless I see the font nice check out usage I'm not seen anything there because there's no there's no search for the site I wonder if it's like that with everything if I'm not getting family okay so Roboto is it's here it's just not being applied here for some reason okay let me I'm about halfway through the stream for today so I do want to go to the live chat just just quickly and see if there are any questions or you know any new people to welcome before I solve this this font problem Oh Sean says connections really laggy so yeah sorry about that okay Patrick sing there's there's more to flow text than what I'm copying so let me check did I maybe I missed maybe I missed some stuff here I mean maybe I should pull in some of the baseline font stuff okay I'm not maybe I'm missing it yeah maybe I had thought that maybe the base font is different so then all those the flow tax classes and the media queries would be slightly off from what I'm used to bill says have you thought of using styled components yes I have thought of using the style components so I'm gonna look into that I would actually like to make each of the components completely selfcontained if I could so say that could be a goal for this project because then I'd like to be able to just reuse them it'd be cool actually to make like Kevin had made the letterhead card it would be cool to just make card component which I mean they already have the card component so I'd have to call it something different it could be card but basically a component that would be like it would have the card there but you could control everything in it just through props and then that way I could reuse that for all my projects just control and what I mean by what's in it like whether or not it has an image at the top a title and overlay text action buttons so all of that would be in props and maybe I'm missing something and that's how material UI is already set up and trying to reinvent it here but I think that would be really versatile and especially since I use cards and pretty much everything that I do that would be a component that would be awesome that make that completely selfcontained with everything that it needs to render and just be able to drop it into any project I just see Rowan asked about what the issue was yesterday with the project and I CEO told him that it was Internet Explorer 9 yeah this is terrible Blake asks what is docker docker is like a weighted like like you make a container and your program can run in that container and you can transfer that container so and I mean like everything can run like your entire setup the whole stack can be in this container and it can be copied exactly on to anybody's machine no matter what they're running and it's supposed to be able to run in exactly the same way and you don't even have to install all the same stuff on your machine but if you're running something in node and you didn't have node installed on your machine it wouldn't matter if you had docker and you downloaded the the container then you should be able to run it so that's my understanding of docker I haven't used it in at least a year I would start I wanted to use it more and I just got busy with things and never felt comfortable enough with it to use it for you know in production i Patrick had some and and Bill had some good explanation as well for for docker basically saying it's like like a virtual machine yeah so said it's like like a lightweight virtual machine nice Emily arsenal of color aquatics says come on guys thumbs up this yeah cool give it a thumbs up if you want I don't I mean it's cool when your thumbs up that but I don't really know if thumbs up mean it means much in terms of of anything I don't really know how that that helps other than letting me know that you like the video though they sebastian saying mature you i was designed with Roboto font mine so be sure to include it your project where is that look over okay Patrick said I did get all of the flow tech stuff so cool so Sebastian I'm let me go back so we're working on trying to get Roboto to be the font for for this which I'm it's already being applied to like H tags and I'm not sure why it's not being applied to these P tags at least inspected again yeah so you can see like on our P tags here it's it's saying that our font is just saying serif so I'm not exactly sure what the problem is and why we're not getting you know on the same page you know some things have that fun some things don't so I may just have to import the fonts in one of my main CSS files actually here's the thing I'm not sure about we can test it out but if one of you knows it'll save us a few minutes if I put in different CSS files so it's obviously any importing that font in photo Roboto exists already somewhere material UI and it's already being imported if I try to import it again in another CSS file will the browser know that and not bother bringing it in again or will try to bring it in twice that's that sounds weak the only I mean possibly if if there are different locations that it was getting it from it might think it was two different files but right it shouldn't try to pull it in again right so I know there's a delay so it'll be a minute before you all hear that and can answer so I guess in the meantime just to prepare I can look up okay so this font what a thinner bottle a regular medium bowl I don't know that I need all of these whoops okay so I rarely use bold or medium so I'm definitely not gonna use bold it's possible that if I want something to be bolded I'll use medium so I will grab that cuz not I think about it there's might be some stuff that's boated and then I do use I do like to use some of the thinner stuff if I can on some monitors though it's really hard to read the thin stuff so it definitely has to be a large font for thin to work so let's bring that and let me check this see this okay Sebastian says it's inherited but not using their about a font Roland says it's from the same if it's from the same source it's won't if it's different location versions it will try okay but since it's already imported you can just use Roboto actually I I want to see what's being imported let's see what let's check it out here see where it's coming from or might be easier just to check here wow that's a lot of stuff that when you refresh this page I don't want to see all this okay you know what maybe I won't be able to see it okay I do want to see though if I before I pull in all the font stuff if I just go into this responsive text new flow Tex are we getting robot enough here we go we've got Roboto now okay cool so anyway thanks you said that so I think it was some of the Sebastian said that made me want to do that instead so thank you oh yeah and Roland's mentioned since the age tags are using it it's obviously imported already so that should be that'll work I mean maybe maybe I could put in one of the CSS files I'm not gonna worry about it right now I just want to get this page done but in one of the CSS files maybe I will put just like globally like everything gets Roboto one of the ones that I import into the app.js file okay cool so that's it now like I said I'm still not sure I'm just not sure about the size I mean maybe I maybe it just looks weird because on my other screen I'm looking at the really small size so this is what I'm looking at and it's like a huge difference so maybe that's just the kind of the weirdness that I'm but I'm getting here all right but I do want to before we end today I want to throw in some some fields some form field so let's check out the fields sexy oh so okay so which one there we go I want the floating label that's what we have now so I need two text fields and then a multiline with the floating label okay so first things first let's import text field get that semicolon out of here I don't care if you all use semicolons but I just now that I'm not using them anymore I can't stand them let's see floating label there we go let's pull that in we're gonna need to make a little container for that so we want that to be 50% with so we're gonna get class and that's gonna be six okay so with the classes that we brought in from materialize the materialized CSS framework this means on small screens it's going to take up 12 columns which means full width and then on medium sized screens it's only going to take up 6 so it's going to be 50% width and then we're gonna put our text field in and we need two of those so and put that there and then we need a full width multiline text input and yet we want the floating they were one so actually I want to try let's see don't want to try this I want to try this I'm just curious oops now I meant to put another column let's see how this turns out that doesn't at this I'm gonna get rid of the hint text obviously I don't want the hint text but why is this this big there must be some sort of max max length set okay so that does stack like we wanted to so the thing I was saying I wanted to try out is not to make another row and just to put all these and my my reasoning was if I put another row it's gonna add in a margin and then it's gonna look Auton small screens so there won't be a uniform spacing between here so that's why I did it like that and I because I had noticed that that's how Kevin did it when he refactored the letterhead page all right so let's check this out to see if it has a max width or I guess just a width where is it getting this width from okay so that's saying a hundred percent so at some point it's gotta be setting a width I mean what'd you leave this over a bit second you see okay yeah this yeah that element with here is controlling that so let me check the docs see if I can just change it in here because I I want it to be like here I do have it full full width and that's how I want it to be fully there we go let's add four with true I wonder if I just add it if it'll if it'll go true let's see I think it might yet there you go so that's that's the answer it we just have to add full width which is awesome so full width now let's check it out awesome ok so we have our full width going on okay not bad I think on the other as it is now on the site it definitely has a bit more padding but I'm not I'm not super worried about it okay cool so let's add in let's get rid of the hint text and then we'll add in a button and time is it and then we'll uh then we'll wrap things up a hint text there we go cool this is just I don't know if you all can see this but it looks like it's just not quite as smooth like the animation for this bar it's not quite as smooth as I have it actually that's because on the only other thing that's it so I'm not actually trying to do like the the really cool animation that they have here where it actually expands and shrinks so that's that's why there's I think I was just adding a different color and and weight of border okay cool let's find our buttons amazing raise fun yeah this is what I want so I just wanted to say submit really to just need a simple simple button that says submit and we do want it to be the primary color so let's import this button and then we'll bring in this raised primary put it all right he's fun so it's style is not defined yeah okay what's we missed something then style margin 12 all right I'm not gonna worry about that right now let's just take out the style and see how it looks and then we can put our own margins in if we need to okay cool so actually I'm gonna compare this okay so this is my current effect I don't think they're the same oops okay I may change change how this is working because I don't like it as much as this I'm gonna check I'm gonna have to check the material design guidelines on this just to see but I mean this is I didn't build this a while ago but I'm assuming that I followed what was with materialized CSS for this effect and you can see there they're definitely different so in terms of I mean yes there's a color change and then a slight increase in the shadow to make it appear like it's coming forward but you can see like the increase in the shadow is barely noticeable actually now that I look at I'm not even sure that's happening and I'm not sure yeah this is happening faster it seems like there's not there's not as much of a transition okay so yeah I'll have to work on that button because I just it's not as satisfying hovering over that button as this button I don't know maybe it's just me but but realistically like if I need if I want to keep a consistent brand standard then we need to have the same thing so I'm gonna need to change how this button works then to be consistent with what we're doing across all our sites okay so I think that's it so basically this page is layouts done just need to change change some text work on this button a bit and that's pretty much it I'll probably didn't do it like a comparison to make sure that you know these this font size is correct I just wanna see what the base font size is for material you either this is going off of alright let me go to the live chat I'm gonna go through quickly and hey one of my coworkers is in Iceland right now and she just was watching the live chat and sent a message said hello from Iceland glad you're working hard so I'm not even seriously still watching enough but that was cool alright so I'm gonna scroll up I'll try to get through everything but I do need you know in a few minutes I'll need to end the stream hey we ended up getting about 50 we're up to we're up to 49 viewers now so that's not bad I was I was a bit worried no one would watch because it was at a different time let me scroll down yeah if you have any questions you throw them in a live chat but I am I won't have a lot of time to answer so if I can't get to him you just send them to me on Twitter and I will say I know that some of you have asked me to look over your code and send me messages and I've just been really busy lately so hopefully I have some time this weekend to check it out but just please be a little bit patient with me and I'll try I'll try to get to it okay let's see Rowen says it's too much text together so yeah now that it's a bigger font it does look like it's too much text so yeah we'll see we'll see what to do that I there's a good chance that some of the the text will change when everybody you know kind of reviews this again and so we might be able to get rid of of some of that text rohan says I'm partial to semicolons just feels complete to me I did it was weird not using semicolons at first it felt the same way but now it's you know it just looks nicer without them breath mesh as hey friends can I get a job if I do full stack developing and free code camp yeah I mean you you can there there are people that have definitely gotten jobs after doing free code camp so it just kind of depends on the quality of your work and you know how many places you apply to what they're looking for there's just so many factors that go into actually getting a job that I couldn't say for sure you're gonna get a job with free code camp but it's definitely gonna help you and help you increase your skills and you know the more skills you have the better your portfolio is the better chance that you do have of getting a job Oh Sebastian I see you saw a fullwidth before I did so thanks for that sorry I didn't then look over and see that now Patrick says why is the bottom field so different than the other to look where the blinking cursor ends up on the bottom once it's active yeah it's because it's a multiline field that's why so it's it's multiline and it's currently set to two two rows so if I really wanted it to be uniform I guess I could set it to one row and I'm assuming it would expand actually now I want to I want to make sure that it expands yeah okay to expand yeah I don't I guess I don't mind that I'm used to that but if it'll look better we could always just set it to initially just only in one column I just want people to know that they can type a lot in here if they need to oh and I just see Patrick already got his answer in their live shot so thanks thanks Sebastian for forgiving that answer nobody said today estring barely yeah I did I'm not gonna be in the office later on when my normally streamed so I had to do a an early stream but it might not be bad maybe some people who because of the time difference and things couldn't see the later stream maybe they can't see it so so I guess that's you know that's kind of cool and says would you recommend the beta version of free code camp or the other one and do you have any idea when the beta version will be released I have no idea when it'll be released and I I have no recommendation when we're another because I haven't gone through the beta version yet so I wouldn't I wouldn't feel comfortable giving a recommendation I'll just say you're gonna learn a lot no matter what if if you're a little bit more adventurous and want to are going to be okay if like something's a little bit buggy then I'd say go for the beta version if you're the type of person that gets really mad when something doesn't work right then stick with the regular version because you know obviously it's a beta so there's gonna be things that don't work right so that's that's my my advice some talk talk about my editor it is Adam it is the SETI theme SETI yes it does look similar to sublime Jay rec says what age did you actually start working as a dev okay let me let me think I'm gonna have to do some math in my head here I also say this I got paid to build websites when I was I don't know like 18 was probably the first time I ever got paid to do a website somewhere around there so but I definitely didn't consider myself a developer at that time so I would probably say let me think how old am i right now 30 I think I'm 31 right I'm 31 maybe around 28 I'd say I probably wouldn't really consider myself a dev until I was around 28 and at that point I was freelancing I think I was freelancing for a little while before that but it was mostly like stuff you wouldn't really consider being a dad like I don't like customizing WordPress themes like basic CSS customizations to a wordpress theme to me I don't necessarily consider that being deaf work I didn't consider dead work when I did it before so so whenever I was doing that I you know I I was getting paid to do web site stuff but real dead word probably I was maybe 28 somewhere around there give or take a year so actually occasionally I see people say something like I'm already 20 years old and I don't have a job and as a developer and like they're freaking out so don't worry about it don't worry really so yeah okay so DeMar DeMar key how I'm not sure how to pronounce that pronounce your name so let me know if I'm pronouncing it wrong but De Marchi Allen says I'm 23 with good practice could I get where you are definitely definitely for sure so when I was 23 I was I think I might have been a waiter at the time all right and then I taught high school okay demarcus okay I was like thinking it would be like the French pronunciation but Demark is cool sorry for mispronouncing it so yeah so anyway though let me give you just a brief timeline I actually did a video explaining like my timeline on my own channel so if you check out the link in the description of my channel I did a video on like how I became a friend of dev that'll give you a better idea of just like how long it took me to learn things so but basically when I was around let me think so I graduated with a business degree in 2008 I couldn't find a job for like six months I worked as a manager at a Burger King and then I quit that job and I worked as a waiter at a restaurant and then I got offered a job as a high school teacher so I took it because it was in my hometown I really wanted to move back so I took that job and I taught I actually taught Latin and religion at a high school for almost four years then I quit that job and I traded money on the stock market for a little while until I ran out of money and then so obviously I stopped doing that and I looked for work for a couple of months couldn't find anything and then finally I've started doing website stuff and for I say probably the first year of doing that I would not have considered myself a dev it was mostly like search engine optimization work writing blogs do making minor CSS changes so I was definitely in my late 20s before I really started to try to learn how to be a dev so basically within within the last like three years maybe four years I've gotten to this point because before that my knowledge of development was really like basic yeah no I didn't I did not have a formal degree my degree is in business with a specialization in banking finance and economics not related to web development although good to know it's it's good to know how to handle money and and run businesses and things but yeah so basically my point is I think you can definitely pick up web development and really quickly get to the point where you're good enough to make that really nice site it's really good thing so for me it actually took a couple of years but I had kids and you know at a family I was trying to make money so I was taking a bunch of you know I was taking work doing anything like during that time of me learning I was taking work you know doing landscaping at people's houses painting I'd like paint their basement I would take work like that were just writing writing blogs and things like that so I was taking work doing anything I could to provide for my family so I couldn't dedicate all my time to learning so if you did have time to dedicate to learning you could probably learn way faster and get better than me way faster so don't don't be discouraged at your current age it's just if you have the the desire and the talent and and the time to put into it you can definitely learn this stuff I'm not saying it's easy takes work but you can you can learn it alright so I'm gonna take maybe like two more questions and then I'm gonna I'm gonna wrap it up okay let's see I missed this question so DeMarcus asked and do you consider real dev work to be working from scratch I wouldn't say from scratch but the reason I say that about WordPress is a lot of the customizations you can do in WordPress come like just through their admin interface so you don't even interact at all with with code necessarily so that's why I kind of didn't really consider myself doing dev work I would say you don't have to start from scratch because really who starts from scratch right even you know you set up a project you install a bunch of node modules and there's stuff in there that you know there's already been thousands of hours of work put into you know what you're doing just from your build tools alone so no one starts from scratch but I think the ability to go in and build a site using HTML CSS JavaScript actually being able to write the code at that point I would say that's your developer if you can't do that then I don't know that that I don't know that I would call myself a developer I know people are different definitions and but if I wasn't able to go in and in a code editor and put out a website you know just with the you know basic markup then I wouldn't be I wouldn't feel comfortable calling myself a developer so hopefully that helps I don't want to offend anybody who who does WordPress theme customization it's you can make a lot of money in that and it's definitely needed but that's just how I felt when I was doing it DeMarcus s what are your thoughts on bootstrap yeah I think bootstraps great I think that's a great way it takes care of a lot of really basic stuff in CSS that in my opinion is a waste of time to do yourself I mean it may be like once just to see how it is and I'm thinking mainly like like a grid system you know all the different kind of things you need to make things work properly across browsers so things like that like nobody codes that by hand so that's really really useful so I think bootstrap is good to know there's a lot of places use bootstrap as well Jay says what resources are using to learn this stuff yeah free code camp YouTube videos courses on Udacity all right DeMarcus said great advice Jesse just subject channel so thanks Hank I'm glad you like the advice and thanks for subscribing to my channel as well yeah I hope that helps I thought I saw one more question that I missed but now I can't find it so sorry I okay here it is it was a question about angular four are you gonna cover anything like this for angular for I don't have any plans to cover angular right now I'm not ruling it out for the future but I have no plans at this point to do anything with angular so yeah thanks for watching everyone and I'll see you on Monday and it was great thanks for adapting to the difference in time I appreciate your being so flexible and yeah so have a great weekend
