With timestamps:

00:05 - hey everybody it's
00:07 - Jesse and uh today we're going to just
00:10 - continue with what we've been doing
00:12 - yesterday I I did a little bit more uh
00:16 - so after the stream yesterday I pretty
00:18 - much just was done with work hung out
00:20 - with my family uh this morning I had a
00:24 - meeting and so I did actually come in to
00:27 - the office for the meeting and and I uh
00:31 - stopped over after the meeting in the IT
00:34 - department and asked them about GitHub
00:36 - being blocked
00:38 - and they said it was okay they could
00:41 - unblock it so I now have access to
00:45 - GitHub at work which means I can stream
00:47 - from work and the quality can go back to
00:49 - 1080p for the
00:51 - videos uh so I'm excited about that I
00:54 - think it'll be a much better experience
00:57 - for you all to watch uh
01:01 - so also feeling good today because I
01:04 - remember to eat so if you've watched my
01:06 - streams before I often forget to eat and
01:08 - then I'm like my stomach's grumbling on
01:12 - the stream so today I ate so I should
01:14 - have more energy and hopefully my brain
01:16 - will work
01:18 - better
01:20 - um let me uh I'm going to check how many
01:23 - people we have see if we have a good
01:24 - number to start
01:27 - okay we have a a decent number
01:31 - uh number of people
01:32 - watching sorry I didn't I didn't
01:35 - schedule the stream
01:36 - till um pretty
01:40 - recently uh so I didn't really get a
01:42 - chance
01:44 - to put it out there on Twitter and
01:46 - everything for the link so um I'm
01:49 - thinking
01:51 - maybe some people didn't know the stream
01:54 - was going to happen or what the topic
01:56 - was so we may pick up some people as
01:59 - time goes
02:02 - on I think I actually forgot to check
02:05 - the box that uh promoted the uh event
02:09 - beforehand so it's probably just now uh
02:13 - having
02:14 - notifications uh on everybody's
02:19 - apps
02:23 - so sorry about delay I was just checking
02:26 - some to make sure I didn't forget any uh
02:28 - any other options okay now the viewers
02:31 - are picking up a
02:34 - bit hey everyone I'm just checking out
02:36 - the live
02:38 - chat oh cool Ben says it's first time
02:40 - checking out this live uh awesome glad
02:43 - to have you here
02:50 - [Music]
02:52 - live so people were said it made made
02:55 - him want to eat when I was talking about
02:58 - food uh Lance maker asks when will react
03:01 - classes be available on free code
03:05 - Camp um I don't know I don't know the
03:08 - answer uh you can test out the the new
03:11 - version of free code Camp the beta
03:13 - version uh if you want
03:15 - to I I think you'll lose your progress
03:19 - in the other one I I don't know for sure
03:21 - I haven't I haven't tested out the new
03:24 - version myself so sorry I can't give you
03:25 - a better answer uh but I don't know that
03:27 - there's an a date set uh for the uh
03:31 - every every time I hear an answer it's
03:32 - usually like soon but not an actual
03:41 - date oh cool Sophie says this is uh uh
03:46 - her first time as well for live thank
03:48 - thanks for watching thanks for joining
03:50 - live it's really awesome uh I think to
03:52 - be here live because you get to ask
03:55 - questions uh not just to me but
03:57 - everybody in the live chat is really
03:59 - knowled eligible and you usually get
04:01 - some some really good answers uh to
04:04 - questions uh that you may
04:06 - have
04:08 - so I'm going to get
04:10 - started uh just really quick I'm going
04:13 - to explain what we're trying to do in
04:15 - case you weren't able to watch
04:16 - yesterday's
04:19 - episode uh what we're trying to
04:22 - do let me bring over the uh the actual
04:25 - site for
04:27 - you so what I'm try trying to
04:30 - do is to take this section of the site
04:34 - this just has
04:35 - resources so we want to be able to sort
04:39 - these Resources by category which we're
04:42 - going to add a drop down for category at
04:45 - some point so we want to be able to I'm
04:47 - sorry filter them by category filter
04:50 - them based on whether the resource is
04:52 - free or is it it's paid also based on
04:55 - what type of resource it is and then be
04:57 - able to search within them we also o
04:59 - want to be able to sort them
05:02 - alphabetically uh and also by by date
05:05 - added so if you can think of another way
05:08 - to sort them that would be useful let me
05:10 - know we don't have any type of rating
05:12 - system on here right now and that's not
05:14 - it was mentioned but it's definitely not
05:16 - going to make it in this round of
05:20 - updates uh but for now you know those
05:23 - are the main things that that need to
05:24 - get added for today's show I need to
05:27 - keep this show today to an hour
05:30 - because my wife is going to go get her
05:32 - hair done so I have to go home and watch
05:34 - the kids so uh so I have an alarm set to
05:39 - stop me in an in an hour so uh hopefully
05:43 - we can get just as much done as we can
05:44 - in an hour uh so let me go to the code
05:47 - I'll show you this the little bit that
05:49 - I've added which is really not much at
05:51 - all uh so basically all I've done is
05:55 - I've added another filter so this is the
05:57 - filter that we did yesterday let me make
05:59 - this a little bigger for you all so this
06:03 - is the filter that I added
06:06 - yesterday and this one was just kind of
06:09 - a test we're going to modify this a bit
06:12 - uh because had some good feedback in the
06:14 - live chat saying that we should add
06:17 - another option besides just the toggle
06:20 - if you wanted to
06:21 - see things that are free and paid at the
06:24 - same
06:25 - time so we're going to do that but then
06:28 - I added this other filter and this is
06:29 - going to be our category filter I did do
06:32 - some work on the PHP plugin that we had
06:35 - made to handle our um all our custom
06:39 - post types so I created I used this
06:43 - function to create a new taxonomy a
06:47 - custom taxonomy so it's called resource
06:50 - category and this resource category
06:52 - taxonomy gets applied to Resource the
06:55 - the custom post type of resource in our
06:58 - WordPress uh content management system
07:01 - so
07:02 - now there'll be this category if you've
07:05 - ever worked with WordPress uh you know
07:08 - that I guess I can just bring it over I
07:10 - have it on my other screen
07:12 - so on WordPress I know this is small
07:16 - make it a little bigger so normally like
07:19 - on a blog post you would have a little
07:21 - box over here that just said categories
07:23 - and you could check the categories well
07:24 - now we have resource categories and the
07:27 - way it it's nice to do it like this
07:30 - instead of using the uh the plugin that
07:32 - I had used for these custom fields which
07:34 - is advanced advanced custom Fields
07:37 - plugin I like to do it this way for
07:39 - categories and tags because this takes
07:42 - advantage of all the native category
07:45 - functionality that comes with WordPress
07:46 - so these resource categories will now
07:49 - act like just like the categories for
07:51 - WordPress so I think this is just a
07:53 - little bit nicer and more familiar to
07:56 - users uh I I do like the
07:59 - um custom uh Advanced custom fields for
08:03 - a lot of other things and it works
08:04 - really well but in this case it's just
08:07 - so easy to to do the PHP I mean look at
08:10 - this it's
08:12 - basically you know I didn't write all
08:14 - this out this is copy and pasting and
08:15 - then just changing the
08:17 - name you know literally going in here
08:20 - and just using you know the multiple
08:22 - cursors to go in and change the name of
08:24 - everything okay so it took you know
08:27 - probably a minute or less
08:29 - uh to update this
08:32 - plugin so that's about that's about it
08:35 - so I did start to make this function
08:38 - that's going to we're going to filter by
08:40 - uh so here it is I started the stream
08:43 - right in the middle of making it so
08:44 - basically my thought process here in
08:47 - this function is that it's going to take
08:49 - in whatever the post happens to
08:53 - be right off the bat if the
08:58 - category equals all it's just going to
09:00 - return true because it doesn't really
09:02 - matter what you know every post is in
09:04 - the category
09:06 - all but if it's if a user has selected
09:10 - something else other than show all
09:12 - they've selected a category then it's
09:14 - going to take into account you know what
09:17 - is that category and it's going to try
09:19 - to compare so here's where I'm
09:22 - at I'll show you the
09:26 - data just give you an idea why I'm doing
09:29 - it like this so in
09:33 - WordPress the WordPress API is going to
09:35 - give us this data this is actually a
09:38 - little bit more than I'm going to get
09:39 - I'm going to cut this down because
09:40 - there's a lot of unnecessary data but
09:42 - the data that we really want to know
09:43 - about is this right here each category
09:46 - each resource category has its own ID
09:48 - it's going to give us the
09:49 - ID uh now normally this is a pain but
09:53 - I'm already going to be making an API
09:55 - call to get the
09:58 - categories including their IDs for a
10:01 - dropdown so I'm already gonna have
10:04 - access to that data so it won't be a big
10:06 - deal to match up by ID number instead of
10:10 - by category name which would make more
10:13 - sense and be easier to remember I can
10:16 - get the category name here if I wanted
10:18 - to but I don't think it's going to be
10:19 - necessary and I'd rather not pull all of
10:21 - this in if I don't have to it doesn't
10:24 - make a deal big deal if you're only
10:26 - pulling in a few posts but if if the
10:29 - site grows and later on there are a lot
10:31 - of there's a lot of data to pull in then
10:33 - it'd be better to just trim it
10:35 - down so I need to to match up categories
10:40 - but the category returns an array so
10:42 - resource category as an array so
10:45 - potentially a resource could belong to
10:47 - multiple categories so I need to make
10:49 - sure that I check each element in this
10:52 - array each number to see if it matches
10:58 - up so that's why I have this
11:02 - um well I'm I'm going to go through this
11:05 - I've done a map right
11:08 - now
11:10 - and this is where I stopped so I'm I'm
11:13 - going to have to look at this for a
11:14 - second just to remember what my thought
11:15 - process was gu before I do that I should
11:18 - check the live chat just to make sure
11:20 - see if anybody who's maybe new has some
11:25 - questions
11:27 - um let's see
11:36 - all right we have looks like no
11:38 - questions but do have someone uh n says
11:42 - it's not blurry anymore thank you yeah
11:44 - def I'm I'm at work now I'm in the
11:46 - office so uh when I stream from home the
11:49 - quality is not great but now I have
11:51 - great internet connection and so it
11:55 - should be a good quality as long as your
11:57 - connection is good quality you should be
11:59 - able to stream this in
12:01 - 1080P and it looks like from the the
12:03 - analytics that uh there are there are
12:07 - quite
12:08 - a I wouldn't say mo most people are
12:11 - doing seven getting 720p right now but
12:14 - the second highest amount of people are
12:16 - getting 1080p almost tied there with
12:20 - 720 so I don't know if I don't think
12:23 - I've ever showed you the analytics this
12:25 - is doesn't have anything to do with the
12:27 - topic today but I'm thought it'd be cool
12:29 - to show so this is what I see what I'm
12:32 - looking at when I talk about the
12:34 - analytics so if you've never streamed
12:36 - before you might not see this uh but
12:38 - this gives me how many viewers we have
12:41 - lots lots of things I I usually don't
12:44 - even look at this stuff uh too often
12:47 - when I'm trying to do this but um
12:50 - there's the live chat I can't actually
12:52 - view it in public but that would get
12:54 - crazy because I would hear myself on the
12:56 - delay and so I don't do that but this at
12:59 - least lets me know how many viewers we
13:01 - have and you
13:03 - know gives me a little estimation about
13:06 - the stream
13:07 - quality so anyway just thought I'd share
13:10 - that
13:11 - since I'm always looking at it but I
13:15 - just not sure if you all knew what it uh
13:18 - would it looked
13:27 - like okay oh I did do had one question
13:30 - so one question appeared uh Ben asked
13:33 - anyone ever had an issue with
13:34 - dynamically rendering something like an
13:36 - accordion panel and have the title
13:39 - appear on set state but no functionality
13:41 - until page reload also he said sorry for
13:44 - the
13:45 - interruption
13:50 - um let's see I have had I'm trying to
13:53 - understand think about what's going on
13:54 - here I have had issues
13:57 - with trying to um like initialize
14:03 - things and it not working until I
14:06 - actually did so when I like when I
14:08 - navigated through just client side
14:10 - rendering with no page refresh things
14:12 - wouldn't work but then if I did a like a
14:14 - a refresh an actual refresh in the
14:16 - browser they would work so I have had
14:18 - things like that
14:20 - happen but I'm not exactly sure that
14:22 - that's what you're asking so uh maybe
14:25 - someone else in the live chat
14:27 - understands this a little better could
14:28 - give a good answer I think I'm probably
14:32 - missing I let me know Ben and if you
14:34 - need to you can direct message me or
14:36 - something and uh or give me like an
14:38 - example I'd be happy to check out the
14:40 - code and test it uh see if I could
14:52 - help all right so I'm G to I'm going to
14:55 - start uh going into some of the code now
14:59 - oh okay Ben said I do understand the
15:01 - problem yeah
15:04 - so I'm assuming then that the um the
15:07 - accordion panel has to be like
15:09 - initialized the data has to be
15:11 - initialized
15:15 - um somehow with JavaScript uh I have
15:19 - this issue if I try to use like uh
15:21 - something with jQuery that needs to be
15:24 - you would normally put in a document.
15:26 - ready
15:27 - function
15:29 - I've had success with putting that same
15:34 - initialization uh code
15:36 - into the um let me just show you an
15:40 - example since I I'm here I think I have
15:44 - it okay so inside component did Mount
15:47 - like I'm initializing in this case the
15:50 - tabs so these
15:54 - tabs otherwise these tabs wouldn't
15:57 - usually they would work
15:59 - on first page like if I refresh the page
16:03 - but they wouldn't work otherwise if I
16:04 - went client side so I'm not sure if that
16:08 - helps or if that's possible and then the
16:10 - way
16:11 - I basically this just calls a function
16:15 - the this calls a function that initiates
16:17 - it in
16:19 - my Javascript file so within here this
16:23 - isn't in a document uh ready function
16:26 - all right this is just out there I will
16:28 - say there's a better way to do this and
16:30 - for some of the stuff that I coded later
16:33 - on uh in this site I did use a more like
16:38 - react style way of doing things but this
16:41 - does work and it's helpful especially if
16:43 - you already have some stuff coded you
16:45 - don't really have time to convert it all
16:47 - over uh this worked for me uh the init
16:50 - tabs right here is just I'm using a
16:53 - materialized framework so there's not a
16:54 - lot of code in here it's just the
16:57 - initialization
17:01 - so anyway I hope that that helps uh
17:07 - somewhat and uh like I said if you need
17:09 - like some more help uh my Twitter uh
17:11 - link to my Twitter is in the show
17:14 - description so uh just you know send me
17:17 - a message on there and I'd be happy to
17:19 - help
17:25 - more okay so
17:30 - let's finish this uh this filter here so
17:34 - as I said the thought is I need
17:38 - to I need to Loop
17:41 - through all of the in this
17:44 - case we don't have any posts that have
17:47 - belong to multiple categories but down
17:49 - the road we probably will so I need to
17:51 - make sure that I go through each
17:54 - category that's listed for the post and
17:58 - see if it
17:59 - matches now I'm sure there's probably a
18:02 - better way to do this but the first
18:04 - thing that popped into my head was uh
18:06 - well what if I just have a variable
18:08 - that's set to zero and if any of these
18:13 - are true right so if the category equals
18:17 - what's in this
18:21 - state this an
18:26 - auto uh autoc completed or another this
18:28 - in there
18:29 - so this state
18:33 - category so if the category equals this
18:36 - state
18:39 - category then it'll just add
18:42 - one to that
18:46 - variable and then if that variable is
18:50 - greater than
18:51 - one then it'll return
18:56 - true or I'm sorry greater than Z zero
18:58 - it'll return true okay and then that way
19:03 - uh we should
19:05 - know I mean if you have a uh if there's
19:07 - a better way and I'm just missing some
19:09 - simple way to do this let me know uh
19:11 - because this seems like a bit much to
19:13 - just get this result so I'm probably
19:15 - just like blanking out on a simple
19:18 - answer here
19:20 - um oh I'll start working on this and
19:23 - then I'm sure there's a little delay in
19:25 - the video so I'll be working on this but
19:27 - if someone has a good idea and wants to
19:29 - put in the live chat I'm I'm definitely
19:31 - open uh to your ideas on how to do that
19:34 - so I guess
19:36 - um can just
19:48 - do this so if that's the
19:53 - case then we want to
19:57 - do
20:09 - uh
20:18 - actually I don't know what I was
20:20 - thinking okay
20:25 - um I don't have to do this all all right
20:29 - let's try this let me know if this will
20:31 - work so I don't have to do it like that
20:34 - I don't need this
20:36 - either now's a great time for the usual
20:38 - disclaimer if this is your first time
20:40 - watching this I'm not an expert this is
20:44 - just a show that lets you see my usual
20:46 - work I am uh employed full-time as a
20:49 - front-end developer at a
20:50 - university uh but this is not really
20:53 - tutorial this is just a glimpse into my
20:55 - normal day and this is very much a
20:57 - collaborative effort between all of you
21:00 - watching uh and in the live chat and and
21:03 - me and um I hope that I help some some
21:07 - of you to learn how to do some things
21:09 - but really I end up learning a lot from
21:11 - you all as well
21:13 - so if you're wondering why I'm I just
21:16 - deleted what I what I wrote and I now I
21:18 - have a better idea it's because this is
21:20 - not pre-record it's not rehearsed at all
21:23 - you know this is just my normal workflow
21:26 - so that said here's my new idea my new
21:29 - idea is I can just
21:33 - return can't type today I just return
21:41 - true if if that's the case so
21:45 - if if category then I return
21:49 - true um
21:53 - otherwise I need to return false
21:55 - somewhere right
21:57 - so
22:04 - now I can't return false
22:09 - yet maybe I did need to do it the other
22:12 - way and I
22:15 - just kind of out thought myself here
22:19 - um
22:24 - return all right what I'm thinking I
22:26 - need is basically this is fine but what
22:28 - I need to do is uh if it goes through
22:32 - each of the categories and this is never
22:36 - true when it reaches the end then I need
22:40 - to return false
22:50 - so I guess if I put it out here that
22:53 - would
22:56 - work
22:59 - uh yeah I think it would work out
23:01 - here because this will get evaluated
23:04 - first uh then this and it'll Loop
23:07 - through
23:08 - everything uh so it'll never get down
23:12 - here if if either one of these are true
23:15 - it'll never get to this
23:17 - point um in in case there's people who
23:20 - are new to JavaScript normally the way
23:22 - it works is once you return something
23:24 - then anything below the return uh it it
23:27 - just doesn't happen uh you just exit the
23:30 - function uh so that's what I'm counting
23:32 - on here to kind of simplify things so I
23:35 - think that should work uh now I haven't
23:37 - built out any of the UI to to test this
23:42 - yet but we can
23:45 - hardcode uh some of the things into
23:47 - State just to give it a test so for now
23:51 - what should happen since we have the
23:54 - state by default is for category is all
23:58 - it should show us all the
24:11 - posts so let
24:14 - me well assuming I didn't make any
24:16 - errors
24:18 - here unexpected token I if you can see
24:23 - this uh all right so what do I have map
24:27 - C
24:30 - I probably just something with the
24:31 - syntax let me check it
24:40 - out uh let me compare that so I think I
24:43 - was doing something similar down here
24:45 - and it
24:52 - worked oh you know what I
24:56 - think
25:01 - no I'm not sure what I'm
25:08 - sure okay uh pedroo asks why are you
25:11 - using map to Loop over that
25:14 - array
25:19 - um I guess I didn't need to use map to
25:21 - Loop over the array uh I was just using
25:23 - map so much elsewhere I thought I would
25:25 - use it is there some benefit to using uh
25:29 - just a regular Loop in this
25:35 - case
25:36 - Okay uh Sergio says I forgot some curly
25:41 - brackets so let's see what did I
25:45 - forget category oh
25:56 - okay I'm assume you're saying right here
25:59 - I forgot the curly brackets and I
26:05 - need shoot I'm thinking okay just trying
26:09 - to figure out where I needed to copy it
26:13 - from see if that fixed it no it didn't
26:17 - now I probably copied this wrong or did
26:20 - something wrong
26:26 - uh
26:44 - sorry I wasn't I was looking at
26:46 - something on my other screen sorry for
26:49 - the uh the period of Silence there
26:56 - um okay what Benjamin says in the live
27:00 - chat
27:02 - uh I'm missing some parentheses after
27:05 - map
27:17 - category okay so I should put category
27:19 - in
27:21 - parenthesis
27:26 - yes
27:34 - okay let's see if
27:41 - that now I
27:56 - probably
28:07 - that's odd seems like everything's
28:11 - closing this is real programming right
28:14 - here trying to figure out where where
28:17 - you misplaced a bracket or
28:26 - parentheses
28:29 - okay Sergio all right now Benjamin
28:32 - saying or
28:33 - no Sergio says one line lower after
28:37 - bracket
28:38 - okay uh let's
28:49 - see so I should put this one line lower
28:52 - then I'm assuming this is if um
29:00 - hey all right well that's a different
29:02 - error so I'm happy with that that's
29:04 - progress so filter by category is not
29:11 - defined which line is
29:26 - this3
29:30 - well that's odd it's
29:33 - obviously what's def
29:40 - find
29:53 - H all
29:56 - right it did this sorry I just restarted
29:59 - the uh Dev server for some reason and if
30:01 - you've been watching for a while uh some
30:05 - previous
30:07 - shows something's weird with my Dev
30:09 - server and it's odd because it doesn't
30:11 - have like if I pull down this this repo
30:13 - on other machines I don't have the
30:15 - problem but on this machine uh my Dev
30:18 - server just Will Will just hang and
30:20 - it'll just act it'll just load you know
30:23 - it'll look like it's loading for a long
30:24 - time and nothing happens why
30:53 - I'm just reading through making sure I
30:54 - didn't misspell something let me check
30:56 - down here
31:04 - all right that looks like it's fine
31:06 - everything's spelled
31:09 - right hey Sebastian just came in the
31:11 - live chat how's it going I'm glad you
31:14 - could join
31:26 - in
31:34 - okay there was actually some discussion
31:36 - in the live chat about my use of map so
31:39 - I just want to fill you all in in case
31:40 - you're watching later on and can't see
31:42 - the chat uh
31:48 - so uh Pedro had asked me why I was using
31:51 - map to Loop over uh that
31:54 - array and
31:59 - let's see where I'm at
32:02 - um Bill said map is more efficient than
32:06 - four or four each if I remember
32:11 - correctly uh Pedro says says no map is
32:14 - used when you want to return an array
32:17 - based uh on the previous
32:26 - one
32:34 - all
32:36 - right so is the consensus then that I
32:39 - should totally change this and not use
32:41 - map or is it cool to just use map um oh
32:45 - I also have some do some things here it
32:47 - says uh Sergio
32:50 - says you don't have if you only have one
32:52 - parameter to the function uh to an arrow
32:55 - function you don't need to put it in
32:57 - brackets that's what I thought so why I
32:59 - I didn't have them at
33:01 - first and then I threw them in there um
33:05 - so
33:09 - let's let's just remove some of this and
33:12 - try to simplify it and then maybe it'll
33:14 - be easier for me to see what is going on
33:17 - and why
33:19 - I um why I keep getting an
33:23 - error okay so this should be simple I I
33:26 - should be a ble to do this with the
33:31 - arrow um now I have so that's in the
33:35 - right place that's in the right place
33:38 - this closes that this closes that all
33:41 - right I'm pretty sure that's what I had
33:43 - before so let's see if I get the same
33:44 - error okay yeah I'm
33:47 - getting I'm getting an error here so
33:51 - obviously I'm doing something wrong then
33:54 - in the way that I'm doing this maybe I
33:57 - ought to just do a normal
34:06 - Loop H
34:09 - Sebastian Sebastian said uh he missed
34:12 - yesterday because I was at the pool aome
34:15 - much I was uh I was in the pool myself a
34:20 - few days
34:21 - ago I got actually I had all my kids are
34:24 - in the pool with me and I they wanted me
34:26 - to keep like throwing them and see like
34:27 - how high in the air could I throw them
34:29 - and then they'd fall Splash in the water
34:32 - and uh I tell you what I was really sore
34:35 - after throwing them for for a long time
34:38 - so it was a great workout so if you're
34:40 - looking for some good uh you know
34:43 - alternative workouts go throw some kids
34:45 - around in a
34:47 - pool hopefully they'll be your own kids
34:49 - though
34:50 - cuz not not sure parents would like it
34:53 - if you just grabbed their kids
34:55 - randomly
34:57 - okay so Pedro has actually uh written
35:00 - some code and posted it in the live chat
35:03 - to try
35:05 - so thank you Pedro I'm gonna I'm G to
35:08 - copy and paste what Pedro has put in
35:12 - here and see how that does I really
35:16 - appreciate that Pedro all right so let's
35:18 - paste this in uh let me
35:25 - see okay it's the whole function
35:30 - so put this whole thing in
35:44 - here actually and Sergio I see yours now
35:47 - too so
35:50 - uh
35:52 - man too bad they don't have um like you
35:56 - can't put code in to the live chat and
35:59 - have it be formatted so let me make a a
36:03 - this a little bit formatted o filter by
36:25 - category
36:32 - I guess I don't have let's see if it
36:34 - works first and then I'll format it no
36:37 - sense in formatting it if it's not going
36:39 - to work ah shoot now I'm getting this
36:42 - this error again filter by categor is
36:45 - not
36:54 - defined actually I don't
36:57 - I don't even need to format this uh
36:59 - since we're using prettier as soon as we
37:02 - uh commit this uh then it'll do all the
37:06 - work for us
37:08 - so it's a waste of time right now all
37:12 - right
37:14 - so I suppose at some point what we put
37:17 - in did work because we're getting the
37:19 - same error now with with this with what
37:22 - Pedro gave uh which I'm assuming also
37:24 - will work uh
37:26 - [Music]
37:29 - so oh okay ambero thanks for bringing
37:33 - that up again ambero said remember that
37:35 - there may be non-print characters when
37:37 - you copy and paste
37:43 - so let
37:49 - me okay it doesn't look like there's a
37:51 - space
37:53 - there the last time this happened I copy
37:55 - things I just had to to go through like
37:58 - this although usually when that happens
38:01 - uh the error message tells me at least
38:03 - where the space is this error message is
38:07 - not all right it looks good what will
38:10 - usually happen is there's like some
38:11 - space that's not visible to me but as I
38:15 - go through with the arrow key I'll hit
38:17 - the arrow key twice and the cursor won't
38:20 - move it won't move twice it'll stay in
38:22 - the same spot once and then I know
38:24 - there's some invisible tiny space there
38:37 - so all right so now we're getting some
38:41 - I'm getting some feedback in the live
38:44 - chat
38:48 - um that's it oh man good good job Pedro
38:52 - all right let me let me share why I just
38:54 - said that Pedro said you have have to
38:56 - use this filter by
39:01 - category how many times uh this happens
39:05 - to me I don't know if I want to say
39:07 - frequently but maybe like once every
39:11 - week or so at least uh I forget to use
39:14 - this when I need to use this so I don't
39:17 - know does that happen to anyone else I
39:19 - can't just put filter by category there
39:21 - I got to put this all right let's try it
39:25 - now
39:28 - all right not ex just refresh there we
39:31 - go wow that's still not what I wanted
39:33 - what is going
39:38 - on oh I just had it zoomed in
39:42 - okay all right
39:45 - so
39:54 - oh all right I don't think this is all
39:56 - of them so we're so something's
40:01 - not something's not
40:09 - working H that
40:14 - was that was odd because that gave us
40:17 - all the
40:18 - posts but if you could see like this
40:21 - should have gone through the same like
40:23 - when this state changed it should
40:24 - have uh re rendered gone through the
40:27 - same filter process so it just didn't
40:29 - work right off the bat which
40:33 - is which is probably just due to my my
40:36 - Dev server freezing again okay
40:41 - so I'll just restart that quickly but
40:43 - basically uh that worked so um Pedro
40:48 - thank
40:53 - you and uh sorry everyone for overload
40:56 - looking that really really basic thing
40:59 - that I needed to do and uh taking up a
41:02 - lot more time than I needed to with
41:04 - that uh
41:08 - so Samson says I'm love I am loving this
41:12 - awesome uh thanks Samson I'm glad you're
41:15 - enjoying
41:16 - it uh so all right so we have our
41:19 - category filter that's working now now
41:23 - what I want to do is change right now
41:27 - the only category that I added in did I
41:30 - have the
41:32 - um I thought i' I pulled over the actual
41:36 - uh Json here we go so let me pull this
41:39 - over to show
41:41 - you what I added so the only category I
41:44 - have right now is would just be two so I
41:48 - should be able to put two in
41:50 - there in in the state
41:54 - of actually I hope it doesn't mess it up
41:57 - that I basically put
42:01 - in I think I'm going to change
42:04 - this so that I'm not going back and
42:06 - forth between strings uh and numbers so
42:10 - what I'm going to do is category is
42:11 - going to be zero and so now down here
42:14 - instead of saying category this state
42:16 - category equals all I'm just going to
42:18 - say equals zero uh and then that way we
42:21 - can just keep the same
42:24 - type uh I know
42:27 - it probably would have
42:29 - worked uh
42:31 - regardless where's our
42:35 - uh here we
42:44 - go
42:46 - okay actually so we're we're still
42:48 - getting the same thing here we're not
42:51 - we're not actually getting
42:53 - everything being returned
42:58 - let me do a refresh
43:01 - again yeah that's odd
43:05 - so something's wrong
43:15 - then all right let's go
43:23 - through I had some questions about what
43:26 - I'm working with uh so yeah this is it
43:29 - it looks kind of like HTML but it's
43:31 - actually uh called jsx so it it's like
43:35 - HTML mixed with JavaScript basically and
43:37 - that's what it's react uh reactjs is a
43:41 - JavaScript uh Library framework uh that
43:46 - lets you do stuff like this in intermix
43:48 - HTML and JavaScript uh it does a lot of
43:52 - things but like just to really simplify
43:55 - it a lot lot uh you can mix HTML and
43:58 - JavaScript and it sounds like it's not a
44:00 - good idea at first but it actually ends
44:02 - up being really
44:11 - nice okay so at this
44:14 - point this isn't causing an error
44:16 - anymore but it is actually filtering out
44:19 - some things that we
44:21 - want
44:23 - so let me make sure I had
44:26 - uh price paid no it's not that's my
44:30 - fault I
44:34 - um I had set the price paid to be the
44:37 - default let's change the default
44:40 - to um what was it is it free trying to
44:44 - think what the value is I think free is
44:46 - the value for that so I had forgotten
44:50 - that we were already filtering so this
44:53 - is actually working and since I changed
44:55 - it we'll
44:56 - see now it is actually showing these so
45:00 - uh I was mistaken that is working
45:04 - so CU we never changed that uh this
45:07 - filter uh for price to show all by
45:12 - default uh so we'll have to do that
45:16 - and I don't know if we'll have time for
45:18 - that or not because I do want to answer
45:19 - your questions so I'll probably stop the
45:21 - actual coding a few minutes early uh so
45:24 - that I can answer your questions so we
45:26 - may not get to that but I do want to
45:29 - test this so we should be able to put in
45:31 - two and we should only see one post if I
45:35 - put in two because that's the only
45:37 - category uh that I've
45:39 - created and I've only applied it to one
45:44 - post
45:46 - oops uh cannot repr property sum of
45:50 - undefined let's
45:52 - see I may need to put in a check
45:57 - here
46:07 - because okay yeah so what's happening
46:12 - is it's saying it's undefined because
46:15 - some of the data let's go to the next
46:19 - one it's giving an empty
46:24 - array
46:27 - so let's just
46:38 - do
46:40 - um I guess I could say if if resource
46:44 - Academy
46:50 - category I'm I'm going to have to do
46:52 - like some nested statements here so
46:56 - it's not going to be the most beautiful
46:58 - thing
47:01 - um
47:03 - else if basically what I want to do is
47:06 - to say if the
47:12 - post resource category
47:15 - oops I don't know why I named it with a
47:18 - hyphenated thing and then now I have to
47:20 - use these brackets instead that was a
47:23 - mistake uh but
47:26 - I wasn't thinking when I was doing the
47:27 - PHP for this okay so uh else of post
47:31 - resource
47:36 - category um
47:38 - [Music]
47:40 - equals is not equal to
47:47 - undefined right yeah if it's not equal
47:50 - to undefined then I want to do this
47:54 - stuff
48:01 - what I want
48:13 - to and
48:22 - then okay let me check my
48:26 - my brackets
48:29 - out my bracket matches this one
48:34 - matches okay that should work and um
48:37 - just to explain uh what I was doing here
48:41 - um I know a lot of you are like more
48:43 - advanced and you don't need the
48:44 - explanation but uh if someone is not
48:46 - quite as familiar with JavaScript or any
48:48 - of this stuff I like to give a little
48:50 - explanation uh I don't want to leave
48:53 - anyone behind if if it can be prevented
48:56 - so what what we needed to do was put in
48:59 - a check to see if it was undefined so
49:02 - that we don't get that error so if it's
49:05 - undefined if the resource category is
49:07 - undefined that means we have an empty
49:09 - array so no category's been assigned if
49:12 - it hasn't been assigned to any category
49:13 - it's obviously not going to match so we
49:15 - don't even have to check to see if it
49:17 - matches we can just return false
49:22 - immediately
49:24 - so all right cool so we haven't gotten
49:27 - the
49:29 - error
49:33 - oops but we didn't
49:39 - get we didn't get the post that we
49:41 - wanted
49:48 - either let's see what
49:54 - happened
49:58 - let me
49:59 - see it's possible that that's a paid
50:02 - resource that has that category so
50:05 - before
50:10 - I all right I'm still not seeing
50:24 - it
50:30 - I don't know why it's taking
50:38 - forever
50:40 - okay all right while this is reloading
50:42 - I'm going to check the live chat and
50:45 - we'll probably hopefully I can get this
50:47 - to work and not end with it not working
50:50 - but uh I'm going to stop the coding in a
50:53 - few minutes regardless
50:57 - and
50:58 - shoot yep all right so it's not giving
51:02 - us so OB so this is the data that is
51:06 - being pulled in wait a
51:10 - second I know why it's not
51:13 - working I was trying to get this this
51:16 - part of things finished before I started
51:18 - the stream and I didn't get it done and
51:19 - I forgot I didn't get it done so I need
51:24 - to what I'm doing when I make the uh API
51:28 - call is I'm fil I'm telling it exactly
51:31 - the fields that I want and I did not put
51:36 - in there the resource field so it wasn't
51:40 - pulling it in so uh it
51:44 - basically appeared like
51:47 - there every time I used it it was
51:51 - undefined so let's
51:54 - see all right great
51:56 - so see it it is working so this is the
52:00 - post that I put it on so um awesome so
52:05 - the filter works so basically the next
52:07 - step would
52:08 - be make a dropdown that actually pulls
52:12 - in we'd have to make an API call uh the
52:15 - API call could be made separately it
52:18 - doesn't necessarily have to be server s
52:21 - side rendered uh that wouldn't be a big
52:23 - deal uh so it could be made client side
52:27 - but in any case we make an API call that
52:29 - would grab all the
52:32 - categories uh and
52:37 - then we would get the
52:41 - value of that so basically every time
52:43 - the value of that element
52:46 - changed then we would
52:48 - call a function that changed the state
52:53 - so it would just do a this set state
52:55 - that would change the state of
52:58 - category to the number that corresponds
53:00 - to the name of that category that would
53:03 - trigger render and then everything would
53:05 - get filtered
53:06 - through and then our category filter
53:10 - would
53:11 - work so if that doesn't make sense to
53:15 - anybody let me know in the live chat
53:16 - I'll try to explain it uh because maybe
53:20 - maybe my thought process is wrong but uh
53:23 - at this point
53:26 - we got about seven minutes until I want
53:28 - to end the stream so I can get home on
53:30 - time uh so I'll take any
53:35 - questions um let
53:37 - me someone just asked about uh es lent
53:41 - or something so that just reminded me
53:44 - that this will
53:46 - turn prettier when I commit because
53:49 - we're using prettier so I'm going to do
53:52 - a
53:54 - commit
54:01 - uh I was just doing it on on my other
54:03 - screen
54:05 - um I've I've gone through the process of
54:08 - doing git commits uh often so if you're
54:11 - not familiar with Git we have a lot of
54:13 - good videos on this channel the free
54:15 - code Camp Channel um not for me uh but
54:19 - we have some good videos on how to use
54:21 - git and on some of my previous streams
54:23 - I've I've explained it a little little
54:25 - bit uh but it's nothing like a
54:27 - comprehensive tutorial so if you need uh
54:30 - you know some more practice with that I
54:32 - recommend you know some of the other
54:34 - videos and there's a lot of other good
54:36 - resources out there as
54:37 - [Music]
54:39 - well all right so that cleaned it
54:42 - up and now I'm going to go through the
54:45 - live
54:47 - chat
54:48 - and just to make sure I didn't miss
54:51 - anyone's question from earlier if you
54:53 - have any questions right now please put
54:55 - them in the chat uh if you were just
54:57 - here for the code part of it and uh you
54:59 - can't stick around for uh for the Q&A uh
55:03 - part of the show then thanks for
55:06 - watching and I'll probably be back
55:07 - tomorrow it might be a little later I
55:09 - might have to push it back to 2:30
55:12 - Eastern Time 2:30 p.m. eastern time uh
55:14 - because I'll be doing another uh phone
55:17 - interview for a web developer position
55:19 - that uh we'll be hiring here hopefully
55:21 - soon so uh I'll I'll let everyone know
55:25 - on Twitter and then you'll you'll get
55:27 - the uh the update through YouTube if
55:29 - you're subscribed to the channel uh
55:32 - so otherwise if you're going to stick
55:34 - around please put your question in live
55:36 - chat now I'll try to get to all the
55:37 - questions if I run out of time then you
55:39 - can direct message me the question or
55:41 - put it uh on Twitter or you can put it
55:44 - in the comments uh for this
55:50 - video all right so I'm starting up at
55:53 - the top I'm just going to scroll down
55:54 - and try to to take the
55:56 - questions uh as I get to them I'm I'm
55:59 - not going to read everything just to to
56:01 - save time um but anything that's like
56:05 - directly uh a question for me that I can
56:08 - help with I will
56:16 - answer oh looks like someone uh put
56:20 - something in the comments uh but it's in
56:22 - a different alphabet than I'm used to
56:24 - reading so I'm sorry I won't be able to
56:27 - answer that right now if I had more time
56:29 - I'd probably try to use Google Translate
56:31 - but uh I'm not going to do it now if
56:34 - you're still here if you're this was
56:36 - early on if you're still watching uh if
56:39 - you direct message it to me or put it in
56:41 - the comments then I will take the time
56:43 - to use Google Translate and uh I'll
56:45 - answer you back I I'll translate it back
56:48 - into your language and try to answer you
56:50 - back that way and uh Google Translate is
56:53 - pretty good now so we should be be able
56:55 - to understand each
56:56 - other
56:58 - um let's
57:02 - see okay someone asked about my editor
57:05 - which uh uh Rohan answered thanks Rohan
57:08 - it is
57:12 - Adam oh so um custom crawler production
57:17 - says hello been trying to learn to write
57:19 - code on your website and it's a lot of
57:21 - fun so uh thanks for that awesome
57:25 - um I'm I'm glad you that that you're
57:28 - learning uh let me know if you have
57:30 - questions it's not I mean it's not my
57:33 - personal website free code Camp so I
57:35 - just you know do some some videos for
57:37 - them so I can't take any credit at all
57:40 - for the website uh but I myself uh am
57:43 - going through uh a lot of the stuff on
57:45 - the site and um a lot of the problems to
57:48 - to learn more so uh I'm glad that uh
57:52 - you're finding it
57:53 - helpful
57:56 - naen says uh guys have a look at VSS
57:59 - code uh so it's Visual Studio code yeah
58:01 - Visual Studio code is really nice uh I
58:04 - used it a bit in some of my early
58:06 - streams for a different project that I
58:08 - was working on and I'll probably use it
58:09 - when I go back to that project uh so I
58:12 - do use that as well as
58:19 - Adam uh aswin asked is there any good
58:22 - responsive UI framework for react uh so
58:27 - I have never used it but I think there's
58:30 - a uh a bootstrap react
58:32 - framework and I assume it's responsive
58:36 - because bootstrap is responsive uh and I
58:38 - know bootstrap is pretty reliable in
58:40 - general so I like I said this is just
58:43 - I'm assuming that the react version of
58:45 - it
58:46 - works um for I use materialize for my
58:51 - framework but not the react version I'm
58:54 - just trying trying to basically make it
58:56 - work in react uh I'd love to switch over
58:59 - to something that's like entirely you
59:02 - know based in the the react style of
59:04 - doing things and I know there are some
59:07 - material design react Frameworks that
59:09 - are responsive I just haven't had the
59:11 - time to really test them out and see
59:13 - which one I like um so I can't give you
59:17 - a great answer to that just some ideas
59:19 - hopefully I find a a good one uh for a
59:23 - future project
59:48 - okay still just scrolling through trying
59:50 - to find a
59:53 - question
59:58 - oh and there's there's my alarm so I'm
60:00 - almost through all the chat so I'll I'll
60:02 - go just a few more minutes to find uh to
60:04 - to answer the rest of the
60:09 - questions oh no at some point about a
60:12 - half hour ago uh sea lion lost
60:17 - sound so I guess not much I can do about
60:20 - it now I wish I would have seen would
60:22 - have seen that did it did anyone else
60:24 - lose I'm assuming that it
60:27 - was no one else lost sound because I'm
60:29 - not seeing any other messages about that
60:31 - but uh sorry C uh hopefully the sound
60:34 - came back in for you
60:37 - um and assuming the sound is okay on the
60:40 - recording you can catch the the
60:42 - recording uh later on and uh here the
60:46 - rest of the
60:53 - video uh ATA asks is coding
61:00 - hard
61:02 - um I would say uh coding yeah I mean I
61:06 - guess it's hard it's hard to I don't
61:08 - want to say it it's easy because I think
61:10 - it's misleading to say it's easy like
61:13 - I've been doing this for years so there
61:15 - are some things to me that seem easy now
61:19 - that at first were really really hard uh
61:23 - and there are things
61:25 - like obviously anybody that's watched
61:27 - this show knows there are things for me
61:29 - that are still really hard um things
61:32 - don't always go the way you want them
61:34 - there are bugs so yeah coding can be
61:38 - hard but once you get experienc a lot of
61:41 - it isn't hard anymore and a lot of it is
61:43 - actually really fun so at first when you
61:46 - first start
61:47 - out it a lot of it can be really hard
61:51 - because you're just not familiar with it
61:53 - uh but so if you're starting to learn
61:55 - how to code and things seem hard for you
61:57 - don't feel like you're not cut out for
61:59 - this it's hard it's I it's hard for
62:02 - everybody I know a lot of people say
62:04 - coding is easy and say you know anybody
62:06 - could do it I don't think that's true I
62:09 - think people
62:11 - just probably forget how hard it was
62:14 - when they first
62:15 - started uh
62:17 - and it's it's not easy it takes a lot of
62:20 - hard work I do think pretty much anybody
62:23 - could do it if they put the work into it
62:26 - if they were dedicated and really wanted
62:27 - to do it uh but that doesn't mean it's
62:32 - easy so hopefully that answered your
62:35 - question uh if anyone else has anything
62:37 - to add to that in the live chat uh you
62:39 - know please
62:48 - do uh
62:51 - zanana Zan I don't know how to pronounce
62:53 - that but I'm I'm just going to say Zanna
62:56 - uh I'm not I'm not sure if that's like a
63:00 - combination of words or it's supposed to
63:02 - be all together is one name I don't know
63:04 - but Suzanna says uh so sorry just got
63:08 - here late yeah no problem about that uh
63:10 - with L some live coding on beginning
63:13 - react I need to catch on it quick uh
63:16 - then react native lots to learn
63:18 - currently on code academy or code
63:20 - academy 82% of the beginning course
63:23 - there
63:25 - uh can we discuss projects and tasks we
63:28 - have like can I come up with questions
63:30 - when I get stuck and if I catch you live
63:33 - yeah um so basic I think you're as
63:35 - you're asking a couple of things but
63:40 - um right now I would love to do some
63:43 - videos that are more like beginner based
63:45 - tutorials but and I've been saying this
63:48 - for a long time and I apologize that I
63:49 - haven't come out with very many videos
63:52 - or you know tutorial videos at all I
63:54 - just I've been really busy I started a
63:57 - react course that I'm doing also in my
64:00 - my free time uh so I've just been busier
64:05 - than I thought I would
64:07 - be uh and this website has taken me
64:09 - longer than it was supposed to
64:12 - take uh so I don't have those videos yet
64:15 - and I can't give you for short time on
64:16 - when I would be able to get some
64:17 - beginning videos I did do the course on
64:20 - code academy as well so that's a good
64:22 - start um there's a
64:25 - course that Udacity is offering right
64:27 - now it is a paid course though if the
64:30 - money is not a problem for you so far
64:33 - I've been impressed with the course if
64:35 - you just want free resources though uh
64:40 - then uh I'm trying to think what I used
64:42 - for
64:44 - react I mean react's documentation is is
64:47 - really good I would encourage you to try
64:50 - using nextjs because it does a lot of
64:54 - things for you that sometimes can be
64:56 - intimidating when you're starting out
64:57 - like you know it just sets up everything
65:00 - so you can just start to
65:02 - code uh so and yeah if you have projects
65:05 - and stuff and you want to ask a question
65:07 - feel free uh I always try to do Q&A at
65:10 - the end of my videos uh or you know you
65:13 - can message me on Twitter or something
65:15 - and I'll um I'll try to help you as much
65:17 - as I
65:23 - can
65:27 - Brian asks how do you get square tabs
65:30 - and
65:33 - Adam I'm not sure you mean up at the top
65:37 - these Square
65:39 - tabs I don't really know maybe it's just
65:41 - the theme I'm
65:42 - using I don't know how there how they
65:45 - would look otherwise do they look
65:46 - different in other themes I'm using the
65:48 - seti theme so s SE
65:51 - TI uh so maybe that's why
66:01 - okay Tim asks wait what part is PHP did
66:04 - I hear wrong uh no you did not hear
66:07 - wrong uh there was some
66:09 - PHP so what I did in PHP is the uh
66:13 - content management system for this react
66:15 - site is actually WordPress WordPress is
66:19 - built with PHP uh so I needed to make a
66:22 - custom plugin for all the different
66:25 - custom post types that I wanted and for
66:27 - custom taxonomies so this is that
66:31 - plugin so this is all PHP uh that's on
66:34 - the screen now and to see it's just just
66:39 - a simple plugin uh that I had I had made
66:43 - and it looks like it's a lot but really
66:45 - all this is just the same thing kind of
66:47 - copied and pasted for each post type uh
66:50 - so it's really not that difficult and
66:52 - then I just upload this you know into
66:54 - WordPress like you would a normal
66:55 - WordPress plug-in and that's the extent
66:58 - of the PHP that I really need to do for
67:00 - this just really simple I'm not a PHP
67:03 - developer at all I just know enough to
67:04 - do some things in WordPress and do like
67:07 - basic like form stuff with PHP like I
67:11 - can build a file uploader in PHP and you
67:15 - know really basic things like that which
67:18 - comes in handy if especially if you're
67:19 - working on a site that's on shared
67:21 - hosting a lot of times shared hosting
67:24 - will not let you install node so you
67:26 - can't do it in JavaScript but they will
67:28 - have PHP available so if you can write
67:32 - some basic things in PHP it does come in
67:42 - handy oh Pedro says next time I hope to
67:44 - be at the beginning of streaming and
67:46 - help if I can awesome ped I really
67:48 - appreciate that uh I hope to see you
67:50 - back in in some future streams uh and
67:53 - thanks for all your help in this stream
67:54 - too you you were a really big help you
67:57 - were actually you were the key to the
67:59 - solving the uh the errors that I I was
68:07 - getting uh serg you ask anyone know any
68:10 - other streams on coding
68:14 - um I I tell you the truth I don't watch
68:16 - a lot of coding streams uh but I'm
68:20 - pretty sure Google developers has some
68:23 - live coding
68:25 - sometimes um I can't remember what it's
68:29 - called supercharged or something like
68:32 - that I can't remember what the series on
68:33 - their channel is called but look check
68:35 - out like the Google coders Channel on
68:38 - YouTube
68:40 - and there's somebody else I think his
68:42 - name was Andy M so A and D
68:45 - Yem uh would be like his last name um he
68:50 - does some live coding stuff that I've
68:52 - seen uh but he doesn't I've seen his
68:55 - stuff he doesn't narrate as he's going
68:57 - he just has music playing in the
68:59 - background so a little bit different uh
69:01 - style but still live live coding um I
69:06 - don't know of any other ones though if
69:08 - anyone has any you know put it in the
69:10 - chat now or uh you know put it in the
69:11 - comments below the video and um if it's
69:14 - legit uh I know normally if you put
69:16 - links into a comments on YouTube you
69:19 - will uh it'll get marked as spam but I I
69:23 - check out all the comments even the ones
69:25 - that get thrown in spam and if I see
69:26 - that it's a legitimate comment I'll
69:28 - approve it and it'll get on there anyway
69:29 - so don't don't worry about
69:42 - that oops and uh Phillip said he was
69:46 - having trouble hearing me as well so I'm
69:48 - I'm really sorry about that um
69:52 - hopefully I was was just two people had
69:54 - trouble I hope it's not happening I mean
69:56 - sometimes I move around and I I like put
69:58 - my face closer to one screen or another
70:00 - to try to look at the code so uh I'm not
70:03 - exactly facing the microphone so it
70:05 - might just be me moving around that's
70:07 - causing the uh the issues uh being able
70:10 - to hear me so I'll try to remember to
70:12 - speak more into the
70:15 - microphone
70:17 - um uh Zanna says if you need a nice
70:20 - workout uh you need a big Garden lots of
70:23 - work all day actually I have a garden I
70:25 - wouldn't call it a big Garden maybe a
70:27 - mediumsized garden I don't really know
70:30 - uh but I haven't been doing any work at
70:32 - hardly at all because I've been so busy
70:34 - uh my wife's been doing all the work uh
70:37 - some years I do a ton of work in the
70:39 - garden but this year it's just hasn't
70:41 - been time but I do agree gardening is
70:44 - can be hard work especially keeping up
70:45 - with all the
70:47 - weeds um philli says do you ever have
70:50 - access to multiple taxonomies through
70:53 - the WordPress API how do you handle
70:56 - those I'm actually trying to find a way
70:59 - to handle those properly right now so I
71:01 - don't have a great answer for you but I
71:03 - can tell you my
71:04 - ideas
71:07 - um
71:10 - so obviously you could make lots of API
71:14 - calls to each of those taxonomies and
71:17 - grab the data and then do whatever you
71:18 - need to um what I'm trying to find is a
71:21 - way to get all those different
71:24 - all that different data in one API call
71:27 - I found a plugin that lets you get some
71:29 - but
71:30 - unfortunately you can't use like
71:32 - different parameters for each type so
71:35 - you basically just have to get all of
71:37 - everything which is
71:39 - okay unless you have more than you know
71:43 - the post limit which is 100 and so I
71:46 - haven't found a solution that I really
71:48 - like uh yet but maybe I'll do a video
71:53 - when I finally do find a good
71:56 - solution uh and let you
72:00 - know uh C lion asks are these live
72:03 - sessions done on a set schedule uh yes
72:06 - pretty much uh I try to stream every day
72:09 - well Monday through Friday at 2 p.m
72:12 - eastern time I don't always get to do it
72:14 - at 2 so occasionally I need to adjust
72:16 - the time or sometimes I need to cancel
72:19 - all together uh depending on what's
72:21 - going on but um I'll try to be as
72:24 - consistent as I can be and I'll let you
72:26 - know through Twitter so if you follow me
72:29 - on Twitter then I every day I I'll tweet
72:34 - uh what time the stream's going to be
72:35 - and if I'm not going to do a stream I'll
72:36 - let you know also uh if you're a
72:39 - subscriber to the free code Camp Channel
72:42 - you should get a notification on your
72:45 - phone or um through the
72:48 - browser about when streams are happening
72:52 - so uh basically Monday through Friday 2:
72:56 - p.m. Eastern but occasionally a
72:59 - different different
73:00 - time Ali says uh thank you Jesse oh
73:04 - you're welcome thanks for
73:13 - watching uh nit dog asks uh said sorry
73:17 - if this sounds stupid this is oh don't
73:20 - worry about don't uh I don't want anyone
73:23 - to ever worry about a question sounding
73:25 - stupid like I fully expect there to be
73:27 - people of all
73:29 - levels um and experience levels so uh if
73:33 - you're you know starting out or you're
73:35 - just maybe you're really experienced but
73:36 - you're just not familiar with what I'm
73:38 - doing like with react or anything like
73:40 - that then your your question might be
73:42 - one that's easy to some people and not
73:44 - easy to others so don't worry about that
73:47 - um but uh the question is this is a
73:50 - WordPress site are you using a custom
73:53 - theme or plugins to do this uh so it's
73:56 - kind of a WordPress site um the all the
74:00 - content is in WordPress but I'm using
74:04 - the WordPress API to grab that content
74:07 - and use it in a separate react site so
74:09 - the WordPress and the react site exist
74:12 - on two different servers uh two
74:14 - different droplets on digital ocean
74:17 - so uh I don't really need a theme for
74:20 - WordPress because no one will ever view
74:22 - it
74:24 - like directly through
74:26 - WordPress but I do have some WordPress
74:28 - plugins that make it easier for me to
74:31 - get the data um and add in the different
74:34 - post types and Fields that I
74:43 - need
74:47 - um Andre says coding isn't easy takes a
74:50 - lot of dedication and daily training
74:52 - find your pace and just do it every day
74:54 - okay awesome I think that was probably
74:56 - in response to an earlier question about
74:57 - coding being hard and that's a great um
75:00 - great response Andre also says if you
75:03 - want to work in the industry study a bit
75:05 - about agile and how software projects
75:07 - work with the agile methods and apply
75:09 - that agile idea to your learning that's
75:11 - a great idea Andre so uh yeah if you're
75:14 - not familiar with agile check it out I
75:16 - did take a a course on agile it was
75:19 - through plural site which sometimes you
75:21 - can find deals where you can have get
75:23 - plural site for free for a couple of
75:25 - months uh so try to find one of those
75:27 - deals and uh maybe you could take the
75:29 - course for free I'm sure there's there's
75:32 - other courses out there that are good as
75:33 - well but just from my experience that's
75:35 - where I took a course on it um but
75:37 - that's great advice thanks uh uh thanks
75:40 - for uh writing that
75:46 - Andre Okay Oscar gave an answer uh to
75:49 - the question about this being a
75:51 - WordPress custom theme and basically
75:54 - says he says correctly I created a
75:56 - static site first and then converted it
75:59 - to react and then through the content on
76:01 - WordPress so um yeah you can check check
76:05 - into it more in the uh the repos the get
76:09 - uh GitHub repos that are linked in the
76:11 - description and then also some of the
76:12 - previous shows uh I explain more about
76:15 - how I set up WordPress and
76:22 - everything
76:25 - uh Rohan says I haven't touched react
76:27 - and a really basic knowledge of other
76:29 - Frameworks but I'd still recommend
76:30 - getting to know vanilla JS vanilla
76:33 - JavaScript in and out yeah that's
76:36 - definitely uh that's great advice
76:40 - um actually the uh the person that I
76:43 - interviewed for the dev job the web dev
76:45 - job uh yesterday gave a similar response
76:48 - because I asked I asked the question
76:50 - about what do you think about different
76:53 - Frameworks like what are your thoughts
76:54 - on like react versus angular or what do
76:56 - you think about Jake R and he said and
76:59 - this was the response I was actually
77:01 - hoping that he would say he said you
77:03 - know it doesn't really matter about the
77:04 - Frameworks because there could be
77:06 - another big framework a couple years
77:07 - from now what really is important is
77:09 - knowing vanilla JavaScript and then you
77:11 - can learn any of the Frameworks that
77:13 - come out and I thought that was a great
77:16 - uh a great answer and this is you know
77:18 - basically what what rohan's saying as
77:20 - well uh you know
77:23 - don't at first if you're starting out
77:25 - don't worry so much about learning one
77:28 - framework learn JavaScript well and
77:33 - you'll be able to pick up any framework
77:35 - very
77:41 - quickly uh Sergio says this JS Learning
77:45 - Resource really got me hooked at some uh
77:48 - es6 cota.org yeah I've I actually
77:52 - checked that site out before it is
77:53 - really cool so es6 katas ks.org uh has
77:58 - some cool resources for obviously
78:00 - learning
78:05 - es6 um Andre says one that is cool more
78:08 - towards gaming is the bug Smashers
78:10 - series from the Star Citizen
78:16 - Channel okay cool um I
78:20 - haven't uh I haven't checked that out
78:22 - before for uh but that sounds cool uh
78:27 - I'll have to check that out oh Philip
78:29 - said my comment was a joke should have
78:31 - used an emoji all right sorry
78:33 - Phillip I do that sometime sometimes
78:36 - people joke and I I'm like so focus on
78:39 - trying to answer the questions in the
78:41 - best way I can that I just totally don't
78:42 - even get that some things are jokes so
78:47 - um sorry that went right over my head uh
78:51 - Andre says uh thank
78:54 - you thank you Jesse your videos are
78:56 - really
79:00 - inspiring Rohan says so when do I
79:04 - start yeah honestly if anybody is
79:07 - interested uh let me know like just
79:10 - direct message me on Twitter I can give
79:11 - you all the info you need to apply for
79:13 - the job here I'm not going to be I'm not
79:16 - the one in charge of hiring I'm just on
79:17 - the hiring committee so uh it my opinion
79:20 - will count for a little bit
79:23 - uh
79:24 - but I'd be glad to have you you know
79:27 - working here with me it would
79:29 - technically be working in another
79:30 - department but we would probably
79:32 - collaborate quite
79:34 - frequently
79:37 - um uh but Ro Rohan says but honestly
79:40 - apart from reac and a couple of others
79:42 - most Frameworks are really easy and just
79:44 - comes naturally just in an hour or two
79:46 - of working with him that's that's true
79:49 - some of them like I when I first tried
79:51 - to learn angular like like way back when
79:54 - it was angular 1 I had a lot of trouble
79:56 - with that I think a lot of the trouble
79:58 - was though that I wasn't very experience
80:01 - with vanilla JavaScript first it wasn't
80:04 - necessarily anything wrong with angular
80:06 - it was just my knowledge uh I managed to
80:08 - pick up react a lot faster and I'm still
80:11 - learning a lot about react uh but if you
80:14 - want to throw in jQuery into the
80:16 - JavaScript framework category I mean you
80:20 - can pick up jQuery and like I don't know
80:23 - a couple of hours and start doing things
80:25 - and and it it's pretty easy
80:29 - um let's
80:32 - see okay
80:34 - so Phillip said
80:38 - uh that he may have found
80:43 - one uh a WordPress API multiple taxonomy
80:48 - query so it's like whyyen designs.com
80:51 - boog slash here let me
80:55 - just let me just put it on the screen so
80:57 - I don't have to read you this uh URL
81:00 - which I'm sure is annoying to you so
81:02 - it's
81:05 - basically I haven't gone there yet so
81:08 - I'm not saying that this
81:10 - is good or bad or anything this is just
81:13 - just letting you know in case you're
81:15 - watching later on and can't see the live
81:17 - chat uh so anyway thanks Phil I I will
81:21 - check that out uh well probably not now
81:23 - because I'll have to leave immediately
81:25 - so I can get home in enough time for my
81:27 - wife to get her haircut but
81:29 - um I'll check that out probably
81:32 - tomorrow all right so I'm gonna have to
81:35 - uh end this
81:37 - um which is cool there's not really any
81:40 - other questions in the live chat I've
81:41 - gotten to the bottom uh
81:43 - so I really appreciate everyone uh
81:47 - joining in and uh and watching and
81:50 - especially uh for those you who are
81:52 - contributing in the live chat were
81:53 - really helpful uh today and uh help me
81:58 - help me find out some really obvious
82:00 - errors that I should have seen but
82:02 - didn't uh so I really appreciate
82:05 - everything I'll be back tomorrow uh like
82:07 - I said earlier probably a little bit
82:08 - later probably 2:30 p.m. uh I'll I'll
82:11 - send out a tweet and let everyone know
82:14 - exactly the time uh my Twitter uh is in
82:19 - the description for this video but it's
82:20 - it's Jesse R Wile
82:23 - uh is my Twitter handle it's j SS r w i

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and uh today we're going to just continue with what we've been doing yesterday I I did a little bit more uh so after the stream yesterday I pretty much just was done with work hung out with my family uh this morning I had a meeting and so I did actually come in to the office for the meeting and and I uh stopped over after the meeting in the IT department and asked them about GitHub being blocked and they said it was okay they could unblock it so I now have access to GitHub at work which means I can stream from work and the quality can go back to 1080p for the videos uh so I'm excited about that I think it'll be a much better experience for you all to watch uh so also feeling good today because I remember to eat so if you've watched my streams before I often forget to eat and then I'm like my stomach's grumbling on the stream so today I ate so I should have more energy and hopefully my brain will work better um let me uh I'm going to check how many people we have see if we have a good number to start okay we have a a decent number uh number of people watching sorry I didn't I didn't schedule the stream till um pretty recently uh so I didn't really get a chance to put it out there on Twitter and everything for the link so um I'm thinking maybe some people didn't know the stream was going to happen or what the topic was so we may pick up some people as time goes on I think I actually forgot to check the box that uh promoted the uh event beforehand so it's probably just now uh having notifications uh on everybody's apps so sorry about delay I was just checking some to make sure I didn't forget any uh any other options okay now the viewers are picking up a bit hey everyone I'm just checking out the live chat oh cool Ben says it's first time checking out this live uh awesome glad to have you here live so people were said it made made him want to eat when I was talking about food uh Lance maker asks when will react classes be available on free code Camp um I don't know I don't know the answer uh you can test out the the new version of free code Camp the beta version uh if you want to I I think you'll lose your progress in the other one I I don't know for sure I haven't I haven't tested out the new version myself so sorry I can't give you a better answer uh but I don't know that there's an a date set uh for the uh every every time I hear an answer it's usually like soon but not an actual date oh cool Sophie says this is uh uh her first time as well for live thank thanks for watching thanks for joining live it's really awesome uh I think to be here live because you get to ask questions uh not just to me but everybody in the live chat is really knowled eligible and you usually get some some really good answers uh to questions uh that you may have so I'm going to get started uh just really quick I'm going to explain what we're trying to do in case you weren't able to watch yesterday's episode uh what we're trying to do let me bring over the uh the actual site for you so what I'm try trying to do is to take this section of the site this just has resources so we want to be able to sort these Resources by category which we're going to add a drop down for category at some point so we want to be able to I'm sorry filter them by category filter them based on whether the resource is free or is it it's paid also based on what type of resource it is and then be able to search within them we also o want to be able to sort them alphabetically uh and also by by date added so if you can think of another way to sort them that would be useful let me know we don't have any type of rating system on here right now and that's not it was mentioned but it's definitely not going to make it in this round of updates uh but for now you know those are the main things that that need to get added for today's show I need to keep this show today to an hour because my wife is going to go get her hair done so I have to go home and watch the kids so uh so I have an alarm set to stop me in an in an hour so uh hopefully we can get just as much done as we can in an hour uh so let me go to the code I'll show you this the little bit that I've added which is really not much at all uh so basically all I've done is I've added another filter so this is the filter that we did yesterday let me make this a little bigger for you all so this is the filter that I added yesterday and this one was just kind of a test we're going to modify this a bit uh because had some good feedback in the live chat saying that we should add another option besides just the toggle if you wanted to see things that are free and paid at the same time so we're going to do that but then I added this other filter and this is going to be our category filter I did do some work on the PHP plugin that we had made to handle our um all our custom post types so I created I used this function to create a new taxonomy a custom taxonomy so it's called resource category and this resource category taxonomy gets applied to Resource the the custom post type of resource in our WordPress uh content management system so now there'll be this category if you've ever worked with WordPress uh you know that I guess I can just bring it over I have it on my other screen so on WordPress I know this is small make it a little bigger so normally like on a blog post you would have a little box over here that just said categories and you could check the categories well now we have resource categories and the way it it's nice to do it like this instead of using the uh the plugin that I had used for these custom fields which is advanced advanced custom Fields plugin I like to do it this way for categories and tags because this takes advantage of all the native category functionality that comes with WordPress so these resource categories will now act like just like the categories for WordPress so I think this is just a little bit nicer and more familiar to users uh I I do like the um custom uh Advanced custom fields for a lot of other things and it works really well but in this case it's just so easy to to do the PHP I mean look at this it's basically you know I didn't write all this out this is copy and pasting and then just changing the name you know literally going in here and just using you know the multiple cursors to go in and change the name of everything okay so it took you know probably a minute or less uh to update this plugin so that's about that's about it so I did start to make this function that's going to we're going to filter by uh so here it is I started the stream right in the middle of making it so basically my thought process here in this function is that it's going to take in whatever the post happens to be right off the bat if the category equals all it's just going to return true because it doesn't really matter what you know every post is in the category all but if it's if a user has selected something else other than show all they've selected a category then it's going to take into account you know what is that category and it's going to try to compare so here's where I'm at I'll show you the data just give you an idea why I'm doing it like this so in WordPress the WordPress API is going to give us this data this is actually a little bit more than I'm going to get I'm going to cut this down because there's a lot of unnecessary data but the data that we really want to know about is this right here each category each resource category has its own ID it's going to give us the ID uh now normally this is a pain but I'm already going to be making an API call to get the categories including their IDs for a dropdown so I'm already gonna have access to that data so it won't be a big deal to match up by ID number instead of by category name which would make more sense and be easier to remember I can get the category name here if I wanted to but I don't think it's going to be necessary and I'd rather not pull all of this in if I don't have to it doesn't make a deal big deal if you're only pulling in a few posts but if if the site grows and later on there are a lot of there's a lot of data to pull in then it'd be better to just trim it down so I need to to match up categories but the category returns an array so resource category as an array so potentially a resource could belong to multiple categories so I need to make sure that I check each element in this array each number to see if it matches up so that's why I have this um well I'm I'm going to go through this I've done a map right now and this is where I stopped so I'm I'm going to have to look at this for a second just to remember what my thought process was gu before I do that I should check the live chat just to make sure see if anybody who's maybe new has some questions um let's see all right we have looks like no questions but do have someone uh n says it's not blurry anymore thank you yeah def I'm I'm at work now I'm in the office so uh when I stream from home the quality is not great but now I have great internet connection and so it should be a good quality as long as your connection is good quality you should be able to stream this in 1080P and it looks like from the the analytics that uh there are there are quite a I wouldn't say mo most people are doing seven getting 720p right now but the second highest amount of people are getting 1080p almost tied there with 720 so I don't know if I don't think I've ever showed you the analytics this is doesn't have anything to do with the topic today but I'm thought it'd be cool to show so this is what I see what I'm looking at when I talk about the analytics so if you've never streamed before you might not see this uh but this gives me how many viewers we have lots lots of things I I usually don't even look at this stuff uh too often when I'm trying to do this but um there's the live chat I can't actually view it in public but that would get crazy because I would hear myself on the delay and so I don't do that but this at least lets me know how many viewers we have and you know gives me a little estimation about the stream quality so anyway just thought I'd share that since I'm always looking at it but I just not sure if you all knew what it uh would it looked like okay oh I did do had one question so one question appeared uh Ben asked anyone ever had an issue with dynamically rendering something like an accordion panel and have the title appear on set state but no functionality until page reload also he said sorry for the interruption um let's see I have had I'm trying to understand think about what's going on here I have had issues with trying to um like initialize things and it not working until I actually did so when I like when I navigated through just client side rendering with no page refresh things wouldn't work but then if I did a like a a refresh an actual refresh in the browser they would work so I have had things like that happen but I'm not exactly sure that that's what you're asking so uh maybe someone else in the live chat understands this a little better could give a good answer I think I'm probably missing I let me know Ben and if you need to you can direct message me or something and uh or give me like an example I'd be happy to check out the code and test it uh see if I could help all right so I'm G to I'm going to start uh going into some of the code now oh okay Ben said I do understand the problem yeah so I'm assuming then that the um the accordion panel has to be like initialized the data has to be initialized um somehow with JavaScript uh I have this issue if I try to use like uh something with jQuery that needs to be you would normally put in a document. ready function I've had success with putting that same initialization uh code into the um let me just show you an example since I I'm here I think I have it okay so inside component did Mount like I'm initializing in this case the tabs so these tabs otherwise these tabs wouldn't usually they would work on first page like if I refresh the page but they wouldn't work otherwise if I went client side so I'm not sure if that helps or if that's possible and then the way I basically this just calls a function the this calls a function that initiates it in my Javascript file so within here this isn't in a document uh ready function all right this is just out there I will say there's a better way to do this and for some of the stuff that I coded later on uh in this site I did use a more like react style way of doing things but this does work and it's helpful especially if you already have some stuff coded you don't really have time to convert it all over uh this worked for me uh the init tabs right here is just I'm using a materialized framework so there's not a lot of code in here it's just the initialization so anyway I hope that that helps uh somewhat and uh like I said if you need like some more help uh my Twitter uh link to my Twitter is in the show description so uh just you know send me a message on there and I'd be happy to help more okay so let's finish this uh this filter here so as I said the thought is I need to I need to Loop through all of the in this case we don't have any posts that have belong to multiple categories but down the road we probably will so I need to make sure that I go through each category that's listed for the post and see if it matches now I'm sure there's probably a better way to do this but the first thing that popped into my head was uh well what if I just have a variable that's set to zero and if any of these are true right so if the category equals what's in this state this an auto uh autoc completed or another this in there so this state category so if the category equals this state category then it'll just add one to that variable and then if that variable is greater than one then it'll return true or I'm sorry greater than Z zero it'll return true okay and then that way uh we should know I mean if you have a uh if there's a better way and I'm just missing some simple way to do this let me know uh because this seems like a bit much to just get this result so I'm probably just like blanking out on a simple answer here um oh I'll start working on this and then I'm sure there's a little delay in the video so I'll be working on this but if someone has a good idea and wants to put in the live chat I'm I'm definitely open uh to your ideas on how to do that so I guess um can just do this so if that's the case then we want to do uh actually I don't know what I was thinking okay um I don't have to do this all all right let's try this let me know if this will work so I don't have to do it like that I don't need this either now's a great time for the usual disclaimer if this is your first time watching this I'm not an expert this is just a show that lets you see my usual work I am uh employed fulltime as a frontend developer at a university uh but this is not really tutorial this is just a glimpse into my normal day and this is very much a collaborative effort between all of you watching uh and in the live chat and and me and um I hope that I help some some of you to learn how to do some things but really I end up learning a lot from you all as well so if you're wondering why I'm I just deleted what I what I wrote and I now I have a better idea it's because this is not prerecord it's not rehearsed at all you know this is just my normal workflow so that said here's my new idea my new idea is I can just return can't type today I just return true if if that's the case so if if category then I return true um otherwise I need to return false somewhere right so now I can't return false yet maybe I did need to do it the other way and I just kind of out thought myself here um return all right what I'm thinking I need is basically this is fine but what I need to do is uh if it goes through each of the categories and this is never true when it reaches the end then I need to return false so I guess if I put it out here that would work uh yeah I think it would work out here because this will get evaluated first uh then this and it'll Loop through everything uh so it'll never get down here if if either one of these are true it'll never get to this point um in in case there's people who are new to JavaScript normally the way it works is once you return something then anything below the return uh it it just doesn't happen uh you just exit the function uh so that's what I'm counting on here to kind of simplify things so I think that should work uh now I haven't built out any of the UI to to test this yet but we can hardcode uh some of the things into State just to give it a test so for now what should happen since we have the state by default is for category is all it should show us all the posts so let me well assuming I didn't make any errors here unexpected token I if you can see this uh all right so what do I have map C I probably just something with the syntax let me check it out uh let me compare that so I think I was doing something similar down here and it worked oh you know what I think no I'm not sure what I'm sure okay uh pedroo asks why are you using map to Loop over that array um I guess I didn't need to use map to Loop over the array uh I was just using map so much elsewhere I thought I would use it is there some benefit to using uh just a regular Loop in this case Okay uh Sergio says I forgot some curly brackets so let's see what did I forget category oh okay I'm assume you're saying right here I forgot the curly brackets and I need shoot I'm thinking okay just trying to figure out where I needed to copy it from see if that fixed it no it didn't now I probably copied this wrong or did something wrong uh sorry I wasn't I was looking at something on my other screen sorry for the uh the period of Silence there um okay what Benjamin says in the live chat uh I'm missing some parentheses after map category okay so I should put category in parenthesis yes okay let's see if that now I probably that's odd seems like everything's closing this is real programming right here trying to figure out where where you misplaced a bracket or parentheses okay Sergio all right now Benjamin saying or no Sergio says one line lower after bracket okay uh let's see so I should put this one line lower then I'm assuming this is if um hey all right well that's a different error so I'm happy with that that's progress so filter by category is not defined which line is this3 well that's odd it's obviously what's def find H all right it did this sorry I just restarted the uh Dev server for some reason and if you've been watching for a while uh some previous shows something's weird with my Dev server and it's odd because it doesn't have like if I pull down this this repo on other machines I don't have the problem but on this machine uh my Dev server just Will Will just hang and it'll just act it'll just load you know it'll look like it's loading for a long time and nothing happens why I'm just reading through making sure I didn't misspell something let me check down here all right that looks like it's fine everything's spelled right hey Sebastian just came in the live chat how's it going I'm glad you could join in okay there was actually some discussion in the live chat about my use of map so I just want to fill you all in in case you're watching later on and can't see the chat uh so uh Pedro had asked me why I was using map to Loop over uh that array and let's see where I'm at um Bill said map is more efficient than four or four each if I remember correctly uh Pedro says says no map is used when you want to return an array based uh on the previous one all right so is the consensus then that I should totally change this and not use map or is it cool to just use map um oh I also have some do some things here it says uh Sergio says you don't have if you only have one parameter to the function uh to an arrow function you don't need to put it in brackets that's what I thought so why I I didn't have them at first and then I threw them in there um so let's let's just remove some of this and try to simplify it and then maybe it'll be easier for me to see what is going on and why I um why I keep getting an error okay so this should be simple I I should be a ble to do this with the arrow um now I have so that's in the right place that's in the right place this closes that this closes that all right I'm pretty sure that's what I had before so let's see if I get the same error okay yeah I'm getting I'm getting an error here so obviously I'm doing something wrong then in the way that I'm doing this maybe I ought to just do a normal Loop H Sebastian Sebastian said uh he missed yesterday because I was at the pool aome much I was uh I was in the pool myself a few days ago I got actually I had all my kids are in the pool with me and I they wanted me to keep like throwing them and see like how high in the air could I throw them and then they'd fall Splash in the water and uh I tell you what I was really sore after throwing them for for a long time so it was a great workout so if you're looking for some good uh you know alternative workouts go throw some kids around in a pool hopefully they'll be your own kids though cuz not not sure parents would like it if you just grabbed their kids randomly okay so Pedro has actually uh written some code and posted it in the live chat to try so thank you Pedro I'm gonna I'm G to copy and paste what Pedro has put in here and see how that does I really appreciate that Pedro all right so let's paste this in uh let me see okay it's the whole function so put this whole thing in here actually and Sergio I see yours now too so uh man too bad they don't have um like you can't put code in to the live chat and have it be formatted so let me make a a this a little bit formatted o filter by category I guess I don't have let's see if it works first and then I'll format it no sense in formatting it if it's not going to work ah shoot now I'm getting this this error again filter by categor is not defined actually I don't I don't even need to format this uh since we're using prettier as soon as we uh commit this uh then it'll do all the work for us so it's a waste of time right now all right so I suppose at some point what we put in did work because we're getting the same error now with with this with what Pedro gave uh which I'm assuming also will work uh so oh okay ambero thanks for bringing that up again ambero said remember that there may be nonprint characters when you copy and paste so let me okay it doesn't look like there's a space there the last time this happened I copy things I just had to to go through like this although usually when that happens uh the error message tells me at least where the space is this error message is not all right it looks good what will usually happen is there's like some space that's not visible to me but as I go through with the arrow key I'll hit the arrow key twice and the cursor won't move it won't move twice it'll stay in the same spot once and then I know there's some invisible tiny space there so all right so now we're getting some I'm getting some feedback in the live chat um that's it oh man good good job Pedro all right let me let me share why I just said that Pedro said you have have to use this filter by category how many times uh this happens to me I don't know if I want to say frequently but maybe like once every week or so at least uh I forget to use this when I need to use this so I don't know does that happen to anyone else I can't just put filter by category there I got to put this all right let's try it now all right not ex just refresh there we go wow that's still not what I wanted what is going on oh I just had it zoomed in okay all right so oh all right I don't think this is all of them so we're so something's not something's not working H that was that was odd because that gave us all the posts but if you could see like this should have gone through the same like when this state changed it should have uh re rendered gone through the same filter process so it just didn't work right off the bat which is which is probably just due to my my Dev server freezing again okay so I'll just restart that quickly but basically uh that worked so um Pedro thank you and uh sorry everyone for overload looking that really really basic thing that I needed to do and uh taking up a lot more time than I needed to with that uh so Samson says I'm love I am loving this awesome uh thanks Samson I'm glad you're enjoying it uh so all right so we have our category filter that's working now now what I want to do is change right now the only category that I added in did I have the um I thought i' I pulled over the actual uh Json here we go so let me pull this over to show you what I added so the only category I have right now is would just be two so I should be able to put two in there in in the state of actually I hope it doesn't mess it up that I basically put in I think I'm going to change this so that I'm not going back and forth between strings uh and numbers so what I'm going to do is category is going to be zero and so now down here instead of saying category this state category equals all I'm just going to say equals zero uh and then that way we can just keep the same type uh I know it probably would have worked uh regardless where's our uh here we go okay actually so we're we're still getting the same thing here we're not we're not actually getting everything being returned let me do a refresh again yeah that's odd so something's wrong then all right let's go through I had some questions about what I'm working with uh so yeah this is it it looks kind of like HTML but it's actually uh called jsx so it it's like HTML mixed with JavaScript basically and that's what it's react uh reactjs is a JavaScript uh Library framework uh that lets you do stuff like this in intermix HTML and JavaScript uh it does a lot of things but like just to really simplify it a lot lot uh you can mix HTML and JavaScript and it sounds like it's not a good idea at first but it actually ends up being really nice okay so at this point this isn't causing an error anymore but it is actually filtering out some things that we want so let me make sure I had uh price paid no it's not that's my fault I um I had set the price paid to be the default let's change the default to um what was it is it free trying to think what the value is I think free is the value for that so I had forgotten that we were already filtering so this is actually working and since I changed it we'll see now it is actually showing these so uh I was mistaken that is working so CU we never changed that uh this filter uh for price to show all by default uh so we'll have to do that and I don't know if we'll have time for that or not because I do want to answer your questions so I'll probably stop the actual coding a few minutes early uh so that I can answer your questions so we may not get to that but I do want to test this so we should be able to put in two and we should only see one post if I put in two because that's the only category uh that I've created and I've only applied it to one post oops uh cannot repr property sum of undefined let's see I may need to put in a check here because okay yeah so what's happening is it's saying it's undefined because some of the data let's go to the next one it's giving an empty array so let's just do um I guess I could say if if resource Academy category I'm I'm going to have to do like some nested statements here so it's not going to be the most beautiful thing um else if basically what I want to do is to say if the post resource category oops I don't know why I named it with a hyphenated thing and then now I have to use these brackets instead that was a mistake uh but I wasn't thinking when I was doing the PHP for this okay so uh else of post resource category um equals is not equal to undefined right yeah if it's not equal to undefined then I want to do this stuff what I want to and then okay let me check my my brackets out my bracket matches this one matches okay that should work and um just to explain uh what I was doing here um I know a lot of you are like more advanced and you don't need the explanation but uh if someone is not quite as familiar with JavaScript or any of this stuff I like to give a little explanation uh I don't want to leave anyone behind if if it can be prevented so what what we needed to do was put in a check to see if it was undefined so that we don't get that error so if it's undefined if the resource category is undefined that means we have an empty array so no category's been assigned if it hasn't been assigned to any category it's obviously not going to match so we don't even have to check to see if it matches we can just return false immediately so all right cool so we haven't gotten the error oops but we didn't get we didn't get the post that we wanted either let's see what happened let me see it's possible that that's a paid resource that has that category so before I all right I'm still not seeing it I don't know why it's taking forever okay all right while this is reloading I'm going to check the live chat and we'll probably hopefully I can get this to work and not end with it not working but uh I'm going to stop the coding in a few minutes regardless and shoot yep all right so it's not giving us so OB so this is the data that is being pulled in wait a second I know why it's not working I was trying to get this this part of things finished before I started the stream and I didn't get it done and I forgot I didn't get it done so I need to what I'm doing when I make the uh API call is I'm fil I'm telling it exactly the fields that I want and I did not put in there the resource field so it wasn't pulling it in so uh it basically appeared like there every time I used it it was undefined so let's see all right great so see it it is working so this is the post that I put it on so um awesome so the filter works so basically the next step would be make a dropdown that actually pulls in we'd have to make an API call uh the API call could be made separately it doesn't necessarily have to be server s side rendered uh that wouldn't be a big deal uh so it could be made client side but in any case we make an API call that would grab all the categories uh and then we would get the value of that so basically every time the value of that element changed then we would call a function that changed the state so it would just do a this set state that would change the state of category to the number that corresponds to the name of that category that would trigger render and then everything would get filtered through and then our category filter would work so if that doesn't make sense to anybody let me know in the live chat I'll try to explain it uh because maybe maybe my thought process is wrong but uh at this point we got about seven minutes until I want to end the stream so I can get home on time uh so I'll take any questions um let me someone just asked about uh es lent or something so that just reminded me that this will turn prettier when I commit because we're using prettier so I'm going to do a commit uh I was just doing it on on my other screen um I've I've gone through the process of doing git commits uh often so if you're not familiar with Git we have a lot of good videos on this channel the free code Camp Channel um not for me uh but we have some good videos on how to use git and on some of my previous streams I've I've explained it a little little bit uh but it's nothing like a comprehensive tutorial so if you need uh you know some more practice with that I recommend you know some of the other videos and there's a lot of other good resources out there as well all right so that cleaned it up and now I'm going to go through the live chat and just to make sure I didn't miss anyone's question from earlier if you have any questions right now please put them in the chat uh if you were just here for the code part of it and uh you can't stick around for uh for the Q&A uh part of the show then thanks for watching and I'll probably be back tomorrow it might be a little later I might have to push it back to 230 Eastern Time 230 p.m. eastern time uh because I'll be doing another uh phone interview for a web developer position that uh we'll be hiring here hopefully soon so uh I'll I'll let everyone know on Twitter and then you'll you'll get the uh the update through YouTube if you're subscribed to the channel uh so otherwise if you're going to stick around please put your question in live chat now I'll try to get to all the questions if I run out of time then you can direct message me the question or put it uh on Twitter or you can put it in the comments uh for this video all right so I'm starting up at the top I'm just going to scroll down and try to to take the questions uh as I get to them I'm I'm not going to read everything just to to save time um but anything that's like directly uh a question for me that I can help with I will answer oh looks like someone uh put something in the comments uh but it's in a different alphabet than I'm used to reading so I'm sorry I won't be able to answer that right now if I had more time I'd probably try to use Google Translate but uh I'm not going to do it now if you're still here if you're this was early on if you're still watching uh if you direct message it to me or put it in the comments then I will take the time to use Google Translate and uh I'll answer you back I I'll translate it back into your language and try to answer you back that way and uh Google Translate is pretty good now so we should be be able to understand each other um let's see okay someone asked about my editor which uh uh Rohan answered thanks Rohan it is Adam oh so um custom crawler production says hello been trying to learn to write code on your website and it's a lot of fun so uh thanks for that awesome um I'm I'm glad you that that you're learning uh let me know if you have questions it's not I mean it's not my personal website free code Camp so I just you know do some some videos for them so I can't take any credit at all for the website uh but I myself uh am going through uh a lot of the stuff on the site and um a lot of the problems to to learn more so uh I'm glad that uh you're finding it helpful naen says uh guys have a look at VSS code uh so it's Visual Studio code yeah Visual Studio code is really nice uh I used it a bit in some of my early streams for a different project that I was working on and I'll probably use it when I go back to that project uh so I do use that as well as Adam uh aswin asked is there any good responsive UI framework for react uh so I have never used it but I think there's a uh a bootstrap react framework and I assume it's responsive because bootstrap is responsive uh and I know bootstrap is pretty reliable in general so I like I said this is just I'm assuming that the react version of it works um for I use materialize for my framework but not the react version I'm just trying trying to basically make it work in react uh I'd love to switch over to something that's like entirely you know based in the the react style of doing things and I know there are some material design react Frameworks that are responsive I just haven't had the time to really test them out and see which one I like um so I can't give you a great answer to that just some ideas hopefully I find a a good one uh for a future project okay still just scrolling through trying to find a question oh and there's there's my alarm so I'm almost through all the chat so I'll I'll go just a few more minutes to find uh to to answer the rest of the questions oh no at some point about a half hour ago uh sea lion lost sound so I guess not much I can do about it now I wish I would have seen would have seen that did it did anyone else lose I'm assuming that it was no one else lost sound because I'm not seeing any other messages about that but uh sorry C uh hopefully the sound came back in for you um and assuming the sound is okay on the recording you can catch the the recording uh later on and uh here the rest of the video uh ATA asks is coding hard um I would say uh coding yeah I mean I guess it's hard it's hard to I don't want to say it it's easy because I think it's misleading to say it's easy like I've been doing this for years so there are some things to me that seem easy now that at first were really really hard uh and there are things like obviously anybody that's watched this show knows there are things for me that are still really hard um things don't always go the way you want them there are bugs so yeah coding can be hard but once you get experienc a lot of it isn't hard anymore and a lot of it is actually really fun so at first when you first start out it a lot of it can be really hard because you're just not familiar with it uh but so if you're starting to learn how to code and things seem hard for you don't feel like you're not cut out for this it's hard it's I it's hard for everybody I know a lot of people say coding is easy and say you know anybody could do it I don't think that's true I think people just probably forget how hard it was when they first started uh and it's it's not easy it takes a lot of hard work I do think pretty much anybody could do it if they put the work into it if they were dedicated and really wanted to do it uh but that doesn't mean it's easy so hopefully that answered your question uh if anyone else has anything to add to that in the live chat uh you know please do uh zanana Zan I don't know how to pronounce that but I'm I'm just going to say Zanna uh I'm not I'm not sure if that's like a combination of words or it's supposed to be all together is one name I don't know but Suzanna says uh so sorry just got here late yeah no problem about that uh with L some live coding on beginning react I need to catch on it quick uh then react native lots to learn currently on code academy or code academy 82% of the beginning course there uh can we discuss projects and tasks we have like can I come up with questions when I get stuck and if I catch you live yeah um so basic I think you're as you're asking a couple of things but um right now I would love to do some videos that are more like beginner based tutorials but and I've been saying this for a long time and I apologize that I haven't come out with very many videos or you know tutorial videos at all I just I've been really busy I started a react course that I'm doing also in my my free time uh so I've just been busier than I thought I would be uh and this website has taken me longer than it was supposed to take uh so I don't have those videos yet and I can't give you for short time on when I would be able to get some beginning videos I did do the course on code academy as well so that's a good start um there's a course that Udacity is offering right now it is a paid course though if the money is not a problem for you so far I've been impressed with the course if you just want free resources though uh then uh I'm trying to think what I used for react I mean react's documentation is is really good I would encourage you to try using nextjs because it does a lot of things for you that sometimes can be intimidating when you're starting out like you know it just sets up everything so you can just start to code uh so and yeah if you have projects and stuff and you want to ask a question feel free uh I always try to do Q&A at the end of my videos uh or you know you can message me on Twitter or something and I'll um I'll try to help you as much as I can Brian asks how do you get square tabs and Adam I'm not sure you mean up at the top these Square tabs I don't really know maybe it's just the theme I'm using I don't know how there how they would look otherwise do they look different in other themes I'm using the seti theme so s SE TI uh so maybe that's why okay Tim asks wait what part is PHP did I hear wrong uh no you did not hear wrong uh there was some PHP so what I did in PHP is the uh content management system for this react site is actually WordPress WordPress is built with PHP uh so I needed to make a custom plugin for all the different custom post types that I wanted and for custom taxonomies so this is that plugin so this is all PHP uh that's on the screen now and to see it's just just a simple plugin uh that I had I had made and it looks like it's a lot but really all this is just the same thing kind of copied and pasted for each post type uh so it's really not that difficult and then I just upload this you know into WordPress like you would a normal WordPress plugin and that's the extent of the PHP that I really need to do for this just really simple I'm not a PHP developer at all I just know enough to do some things in WordPress and do like basic like form stuff with PHP like I can build a file uploader in PHP and you know really basic things like that which comes in handy if especially if you're working on a site that's on shared hosting a lot of times shared hosting will not let you install node so you can't do it in JavaScript but they will have PHP available so if you can write some basic things in PHP it does come in handy oh Pedro says next time I hope to be at the beginning of streaming and help if I can awesome ped I really appreciate that uh I hope to see you back in in some future streams uh and thanks for all your help in this stream too you you were a really big help you were actually you were the key to the solving the uh the errors that I I was getting uh serg you ask anyone know any other streams on coding um I I tell you the truth I don't watch a lot of coding streams uh but I'm pretty sure Google developers has some live coding sometimes um I can't remember what it's called supercharged or something like that I can't remember what the series on their channel is called but look check out like the Google coders Channel on YouTube and there's somebody else I think his name was Andy M so A and D Yem uh would be like his last name um he does some live coding stuff that I've seen uh but he doesn't I've seen his stuff he doesn't narrate as he's going he just has music playing in the background so a little bit different uh style but still live live coding um I don't know of any other ones though if anyone has any you know put it in the chat now or uh you know put it in the comments below the video and um if it's legit uh I know normally if you put links into a comments on YouTube you will uh it'll get marked as spam but I I check out all the comments even the ones that get thrown in spam and if I see that it's a legitimate comment I'll approve it and it'll get on there anyway so don't don't worry about that oops and uh Phillip said he was having trouble hearing me as well so I'm I'm really sorry about that um hopefully I was was just two people had trouble I hope it's not happening I mean sometimes I move around and I I like put my face closer to one screen or another to try to look at the code so uh I'm not exactly facing the microphone so it might just be me moving around that's causing the uh the issues uh being able to hear me so I'll try to remember to speak more into the microphone um uh Zanna says if you need a nice workout uh you need a big Garden lots of work all day actually I have a garden I wouldn't call it a big Garden maybe a mediumsized garden I don't really know uh but I haven't been doing any work at hardly at all because I've been so busy uh my wife's been doing all the work uh some years I do a ton of work in the garden but this year it's just hasn't been time but I do agree gardening is can be hard work especially keeping up with all the weeds um philli says do you ever have access to multiple taxonomies through the WordPress API how do you handle those I'm actually trying to find a way to handle those properly right now so I don't have a great answer for you but I can tell you my ideas um so obviously you could make lots of API calls to each of those taxonomies and grab the data and then do whatever you need to um what I'm trying to find is a way to get all those different all that different data in one API call I found a plugin that lets you get some but unfortunately you can't use like different parameters for each type so you basically just have to get all of everything which is okay unless you have more than you know the post limit which is 100 and so I haven't found a solution that I really like uh yet but maybe I'll do a video when I finally do find a good solution uh and let you know uh C lion asks are these live sessions done on a set schedule uh yes pretty much uh I try to stream every day well Monday through Friday at 2 p.m eastern time I don't always get to do it at 2 so occasionally I need to adjust the time or sometimes I need to cancel all together uh depending on what's going on but um I'll try to be as consistent as I can be and I'll let you know through Twitter so if you follow me on Twitter then I every day I I'll tweet uh what time the stream's going to be and if I'm not going to do a stream I'll let you know also uh if you're a subscriber to the free code Camp Channel you should get a notification on your phone or um through the browser about when streams are happening so uh basically Monday through Friday 2 p.m. Eastern but occasionally a different different time Ali says uh thank you Jesse oh you're welcome thanks for watching uh nit dog asks uh said sorry if this sounds stupid this is oh don't worry about don't uh I don't want anyone to ever worry about a question sounding stupid like I fully expect there to be people of all levels um and experience levels so uh if you're you know starting out or you're just maybe you're really experienced but you're just not familiar with what I'm doing like with react or anything like that then your your question might be one that's easy to some people and not easy to others so don't worry about that um but uh the question is this is a WordPress site are you using a custom theme or plugins to do this uh so it's kind of a WordPress site um the all the content is in WordPress but I'm using the WordPress API to grab that content and use it in a separate react site so the WordPress and the react site exist on two different servers uh two different droplets on digital ocean so uh I don't really need a theme for WordPress because no one will ever view it like directly through WordPress but I do have some WordPress plugins that make it easier for me to get the data um and add in the different post types and Fields that I need um Andre says coding isn't easy takes a lot of dedication and daily training find your pace and just do it every day okay awesome I think that was probably in response to an earlier question about coding being hard and that's a great um great response Andre also says if you want to work in the industry study a bit about agile and how software projects work with the agile methods and apply that agile idea to your learning that's a great idea Andre so uh yeah if you're not familiar with agile check it out I did take a a course on agile it was through plural site which sometimes you can find deals where you can have get plural site for free for a couple of months uh so try to find one of those deals and uh maybe you could take the course for free I'm sure there's there's other courses out there that are good as well but just from my experience that's where I took a course on it um but that's great advice thanks uh uh thanks for uh writing that Andre Okay Oscar gave an answer uh to the question about this being a WordPress custom theme and basically says he says correctly I created a static site first and then converted it to react and then through the content on WordPress so um yeah you can check check into it more in the uh the repos the get uh GitHub repos that are linked in the description and then also some of the previous shows uh I explain more about how I set up WordPress and everything uh Rohan says I haven't touched react and a really basic knowledge of other Frameworks but I'd still recommend getting to know vanilla JS vanilla JavaScript in and out yeah that's definitely uh that's great advice um actually the uh the person that I interviewed for the dev job the web dev job uh yesterday gave a similar response because I asked I asked the question about what do you think about different Frameworks like what are your thoughts on like react versus angular or what do you think about Jake R and he said and this was the response I was actually hoping that he would say he said you know it doesn't really matter about the Frameworks because there could be another big framework a couple years from now what really is important is knowing vanilla JavaScript and then you can learn any of the Frameworks that come out and I thought that was a great uh a great answer and this is you know basically what what rohan's saying as well uh you know don't at first if you're starting out don't worry so much about learning one framework learn JavaScript well and you'll be able to pick up any framework very quickly uh Sergio says this JS Learning Resource really got me hooked at some uh es6 cota.org yeah I've I actually checked that site out before it is really cool so es6 katas ks.org uh has some cool resources for obviously learning es6 um Andre says one that is cool more towards gaming is the bug Smashers series from the Star Citizen Channel okay cool um I haven't uh I haven't checked that out before for uh but that sounds cool uh I'll have to check that out oh Philip said my comment was a joke should have used an emoji all right sorry Phillip I do that sometime sometimes people joke and I I'm like so focus on trying to answer the questions in the best way I can that I just totally don't even get that some things are jokes so um sorry that went right over my head uh Andre says uh thank you thank you Jesse your videos are really inspiring Rohan says so when do I start yeah honestly if anybody is interested uh let me know like just direct message me on Twitter I can give you all the info you need to apply for the job here I'm not going to be I'm not the one in charge of hiring I'm just on the hiring committee so uh it my opinion will count for a little bit uh but I'd be glad to have you you know working here with me it would technically be working in another department but we would probably collaborate quite frequently um uh but Ro Rohan says but honestly apart from reac and a couple of others most Frameworks are really easy and just comes naturally just in an hour or two of working with him that's that's true some of them like I when I first tried to learn angular like like way back when it was angular 1 I had a lot of trouble with that I think a lot of the trouble was though that I wasn't very experience with vanilla JavaScript first it wasn't necessarily anything wrong with angular it was just my knowledge uh I managed to pick up react a lot faster and I'm still learning a lot about react uh but if you want to throw in jQuery into the JavaScript framework category I mean you can pick up jQuery and like I don't know a couple of hours and start doing things and and it it's pretty easy um let's see okay so Phillip said uh that he may have found one uh a WordPress API multiple taxonomy query so it's like whyyen designs.com boog slash here let me just let me just put it on the screen so I don't have to read you this uh URL which I'm sure is annoying to you so it's basically I haven't gone there yet so I'm not saying that this is good or bad or anything this is just just letting you know in case you're watching later on and can't see the live chat uh so anyway thanks Phil I I will check that out uh well probably not now because I'll have to leave immediately so I can get home in enough time for my wife to get her haircut but um I'll check that out probably tomorrow all right so I'm gonna have to uh end this um which is cool there's not really any other questions in the live chat I've gotten to the bottom uh so I really appreciate everyone uh joining in and uh and watching and especially uh for those you who are contributing in the live chat were really helpful uh today and uh help me help me find out some really obvious errors that I should have seen but didn't uh so I really appreciate everything I'll be back tomorrow uh like I said earlier probably a little bit later probably 230 p.m. uh I'll I'll send out a tweet and let everyone know exactly the time uh my Twitter uh is in the description for this video but it's it's Jesse R Wile uh is my Twitter handle it's j SS r w i g l uh and like I said the the Link's in the description so uh thanks for for watching uh have a great day and I'll be back tomorrow
