00:05 - hey everybody its Jessie and today we're
00:10 - gonna do some stuff with forms and react
00:14 - so if if any of you have built something
00:20 - with react where you needed to handle
00:22 - form data especially if you had to
00:24 - handle file uploads let me know what you
00:29 - like to use if you know if there's some
00:33 - some package or something that makes it
00:36 - easy that you think is awesome let me
00:40 - know and I'll check it out and I might
00:43 - use it otherwise I think I'll just start
00:45 - out by making some controlled components
00:50 - some controlled inputs and and we'll
00:55 - just go from there and see how much we
00:57 - can get done I have on the screen the
01:03 - URL for our server our end rocks server
01:08 - so you can check out everything that
01:12 - we're doing you know live and I'm gonna
01:16 - paste that into the live chat all right
01:21 - I see some people were saying hi in the
01:23 - live chat
01:23 - hey everyone hey thanks for watching
01:27 - okay and as usual we have the the
01:32 - secondary stream going on on on
01:35 - Instagram as well the links in the
01:38 - description so while we're waiting wait
01:43 - for everybody to join let me just
01:49 - briefly thank those of you who submitted
01:53 - pull requests so we had four or three
01:56 - three three for us yeah we had three
01:59 - pull requests since yesterday stream so
02:03 - thank you to Kevin and Sebastian for the
02:07 - pull request I merge these in this one
02:10 - eye closed just because
02:13 - Sebastian had already done the same
02:15 - thing in this pull request but this one
02:18 - this pull request had some other stuff
02:20 - that I wanted to merge so since I was
02:22 - gonna merge this anyway I just closed
02:25 - this one otherwise there would have been
02:27 - merged conflicts because the same lines
02:29 - were being changed in the files so but
02:36 - we have basically some additional
02:39 - testing and then now if you do clone the
02:43 - the repo and you try to commit something
02:46 - the tests will run on commit so it'll be
02:50 - a little little extra in your in your
02:53 - console you'll see that the test run and
02:57 - when we can I'm assuming that at some
03:00 - point during today's stream will commit
03:02 - something so you'll be able to see what
03:03 - that looks like in the terminal so that
03:06 - was awesome thanks Kevin
03:08 - and Sebastian did it he did a few things
03:13 - so he moved move the components into the
03:20 - proper folder a little bit of
03:22 - organization and made sure that it when
03:26 - we're where we were using that component
03:28 - the the path changed to reflect the new
03:32 - location and then also we have this you
03:38 - could you could see it if you're
03:40 - checking out the N drop link but I'll
03:45 - bring it over I kept on my other screen
03:47 - yeah let me bring this over so the
03:50 - upload button so we we ended the string
03:55 - yesterday talking about this file upload
03:59 - so what Sebastian did was took all these
04:02 - styles and some of the JavaScript for
04:07 - the file upload actually it converted
04:12 - the JavaScript that was being used by
04:15 - materialized framework into something
04:17 - that was better with react you know the
04:21 - more of the react way of doing things
04:23 - and got the file upload working so
04:28 - it looks good it looks almost exactly
04:30 - like what I had before which I'll I'll
04:35 - bring that on the screen to to compare I
04:43 - gotta open it again this it always loves
04:48 - me out of the system that this is in I
04:52 - always have to log back in but with the
04:55 - exception of the color and possibly the
04:58 - size you can see it looks pretty much
05:01 - exactly the same the only thing that I
05:04 - guess we don't have is this this text
05:07 - which i think is not necessary maybe the
05:12 - only reason I put that there was just to
05:14 - let people know that they could upload
05:15 - more than one file but that's implied by
05:19 - the use of the plural files here as well
05:22 - so I'm not even sure I'm gonna put that
05:25 - in here so thank thank you for that
05:32 - Sebastian and Kevin and you can see I've
05:37 - added in the the proper labels for a lot
05:41 - of these and down here actually this was
05:46 - way more tricky than I thought it would
05:49 - be so the default for checkbox is the
05:53 - material UI is that you can click
05:54 - anywhere on the label and it'll either
05:59 - select that checkbox or unselected so I
06:04 - tried to put a link in here and I did
06:07 - put the link in so you can I was able to
06:10 - pass in an element and I just wrapped
06:14 - this in a span and then put the link in
06:18 - but I couldn't click it every time I
06:21 - tried to click the link it actually you
06:23 - know made the checkbox become selected
06:25 - and unselected so this it's a little bit
06:28 - odd so the solution after I shot a few
06:30 - things the best solution was there was
06:33 - basically a div that was enclosing all
06:37 - of this and I just
06:38 - the div like I think 35 pixels wide so
06:42 - now the div stops you can see where it
06:44 - stops like right here so then that
06:47 - allows this link to work so a little bit
06:52 - of an odd thing but just thought I'd
06:54 - bring that up and in case in case anyone
06:58 - wondered if you looked at the code and
06:59 - saw the weird stuff I was going with
07:01 - this that's why I did it like that
07:05 - all right so we have the form and I mean
07:11 - with the exception of you know some
07:13 - minor minor things of you know the
07:16 - padding and things like that the names
07:19 - for these this is pretty much what the
07:21 - form is going to be also changed this a
07:25 - bit but what I want to do is have this
07:28 - form actually do something because right
07:30 - now nothing happens you can hit the
07:32 - submit button and nothing happens
07:37 - so we need we need to do something so
07:42 - let me let me explain what how I
07:45 - envisioned this working and then you all
07:47 - can let me know whether or not that's a
07:49 - good idea or if you have a better idea
07:51 - so what will happen basically is all
07:57 - these will be controlled let me bring up
08:00 - just so you all know in case you're not
08:02 - familiar with the idea of controlled
08:05 - input where did I have it I always have
08:11 - too many windows open to have it here oh
08:16 - I had it up here the whole time
08:17 - okay so controlled components if you go
08:26 - to just the the react Doc's Facebook
08:31 - github io / react slash Docs and you go
08:36 - to the forms page it talks about this so
08:40 - you can read up more on it but basically
08:43 - what we're gonna do is every time one of
08:49 - these changes
08:51 - so the value changes it's going to
08:53 - update the state for that component and
08:56 - then the value we get the value for that
09:02 - component from state so what ends up
09:05 - happening is that we don't change the
09:08 - value directly I mean sitting from a
09:11 - user's perspective it works the same way
09:13 - but what's happening behind the scenes
09:15 - is that we don't change the value
09:17 - directly when you we type in here the on
09:20 - change fires and then it changes the
09:25 - state and then since the state has
09:27 - changed it causes the render the
09:31 - rerender and then the value you get the
09:35 - value from state so everything kind of
09:39 - flows
09:40 - I guess differently normally it's just
09:43 - like directly changing the value when
09:44 - you type in there now why would we want
09:46 - to do it like that
09:48 - well one nice thing is it makes it easy
09:51 - to do validation so I don't know that I
09:55 - absolutely need a lot of validation for
09:58 - this but it leaves us open to that if we
10:02 - do it like this right away also all of
10:05 - our values then are going to be in the
10:08 - state and it's going to be really easy
10:10 - to pull those values and do whatever we
10:12 - need to with them so we're gonna do that
10:17 - we're gonna grab the at some point when
10:22 - the user click Submit
10:23 - we're gonna need to get all those values
10:26 - and what's probably gonna happen is
10:29 - they're gonna get sent to our server j/s
10:35 - which we may have to eject or create
10:40 - react app so as you know we used create
10:42 - react app to do this and if you notice
10:45 - we don't have a server ojs file here so
10:50 - we're probably going to need to eject it
10:53 - unless anyone else has a better idea
10:55 - we're going to need to eject that and
10:57 - then we're going to
11:02 - in our form data there and then handle
11:05 - everything there server-side that way
11:08 - you know we don't have to worry about
11:10 - exposing any API keys on the client-side
11:14 - which currently I am actually doing to
11:18 - make this work where it is now and the
11:20 - only reason I was comfortable doing that
11:22 - is because it was behind a password so
11:26 - no one could even see this page unless
11:29 - they were able to log in and only
11:33 - employees of the University could log in
11:35 - so I was I was ok with that because
11:37 - probably 99% of the employees would have
11:39 - no idea even how to find the key and if
11:42 - they found it they would wouldn't know
11:44 - what it did for any of the api's that
11:47 - we're gonna be using so now that it's
11:50 - not gonna be beyond the password
11:52 - definitely don't want to handle that
11:53 - stuff client-side so I want to do
11:56 - everything server-side and that's the
11:59 - plan so having said all that what do you
12:04 - think let me know in the live chat if
12:06 - you're watching this later on let me
12:08 - know in the comments if you're watching
12:11 - it way later on then I guess don't worry
12:15 - about because this project will probably
12:17 - already be completed but if you do have
12:20 - an opinion you can still let me know
12:23 - I'll read it later on it just won't get
12:24 - into this project maybe a future project
12:27 - so hey to everyone joining me in an
12:34 - Instagram I think okay it looks like I
12:40 - recognized the names in the Instagram so
12:43 - you all know what's going on I don't
12:44 - have to tell you where to see the code
12:46 - at all right so let me check the live
12:51 - chat since I said a lot of stuff and I
12:54 - want to hear what you all think
13:00 - all right so Don Xavier says four forms
13:05 - you can go with form Z react has some
13:08 - validation and other goodies and if you
13:11 - want material you I check out form Z
13:13 - material you I okay cool I'm gonna check
13:16 - that out
13:17 - let me bring that up on my other screen
13:19 - here I like that they already have
13:31 - something with mature UI
13:40 - all right some checking out the github
13:42 - page now let me bring this over so we
13:47 - had a suggestion you use form Z the form
13:50 - Z mature UI
14:21 - okay it seems pretty straightforward
14:27 - it's not not a whole lot in the readme
14:30 - if you see something to get home that
14:31 - has a short read me it's either really
14:34 - simple or there's there's just not a lot
14:40 - of directions they come with it so it
14:44 - could be really good or not really good
14:47 - but this looks pretty straightforward
14:50 - maybe we use that let me uh let me see
14:52 - what else what else you all think
15:12 - okay Sebastian Sebastian added something
15:17 - that should be showing up okay so let
15:23 - file value equals the state file input
15:34 - okay so basically Sebastian is saying
15:37 - here this is our service request form
15:41 - component that what should happen the
15:44 - file value should say select a file to
15:48 - upload if there's nothing in state four
15:56 - where's the file
16:00 - input so yeah I'm not really sure why
16:04 - that's not working
16:09 - let me refresh it was do that
16:18 - you refresh the page and see that's all
16:26 - I'm gonna check what the state is in dev
16:29 - tools it opened on the other screen
16:33 - there but okay that's odd maybe so it's
16:43 - showing an empty array for actually
16:48 - notes yeah for file input it's showing
16:52 - an empty array maybe I don't know maybe
17:02 - since it actually exists even though
17:05 - it's an empty array it's it's not
17:07 - triggering the the war side of that but
17:10 - that's cool since that's in there I can
17:12 - make that work and then that'll just be
17:16 - an easy way to have that text show up so
17:18 - thanks thanks for pointing that out
17:20 - Sebastian ok Roland says shouldn't the
17:25 - planning guy to open in a new tab that
17:26 - is a good idea so if you notice when I
17:32 - click planning guide it didn't open a
17:36 - new tab but you would except in a new
17:39 - tab
17:40 - especially actually I want to see if I
17:44 - type stuff in I want to see if it saves
17:48 - if I were to hit back no it actually
17:52 - cleared it out yes a good call on that
17:56 - definitely want this to open in a new
17:59 - tab otherwise it would be super
18:02 - frustrating for someone to fill all this
18:04 - out get to the bottom say I'd like to
18:06 - read the planning guide first and then
18:09 - have it all taken away so I think on the
18:13 - current version it doesn't take it away
18:17 - so it doesn't clear the fields
18:24 - so we'll have to see I was trying to
18:30 - think of a way where I could make it
18:31 - make everything stay there I mean the
18:36 - really the simplest solution is to make
18:38 - this open in a new tab so I will do that
18:43 - let me add that so I finally get the
18:46 - Trello board going a little bit so I can
18:56 - I'll send a link to this I'll share it
18:58 - and then put a link in the video if
19:01 - hopefully I'll remember later on to do
19:03 - it and then you all can check out this
19:06 - Trello board as as I'm working with it
19:09 - adding to it
19:22 - and that should not take very long so
19:26 - I'm going to put that down for a half of
19:27 - a pomodoro cycle all right so good stuff
19:38 - you all have great ideas for me already
19:41 - it's just at the beginning of the stream
19:46 - Andrew says hi Jesse just wanted to
19:49 - thank you so much for sharing your work
19:51 - as a beginner learning react this has
19:53 - been so helpful to me oh well thanks for
19:55 - saying that I'm glad that this is
19:58 - helpful to you and I really appreciate
20:00 - [Music]
20:01 - you saying that and then whenever
20:03 - anybody has some positive feedback for
20:06 - me I appreciate that
20:07 - I don't mind critical feedback either so
20:10 - occasionally I get feedback that's not
20:12 - so positive but there's always something
20:16 - that that can be helpful even in a
20:19 - negative feedback unless it's just
20:22 - completely crazy and somebody's really
20:25 - angry but usually there's something
20:28 - something helpful but the positive stuff
20:31 - keeps me going and it makes me really
20:34 - look forward to these dreams and I'm
20:36 - really happy that that I'm helping some
20:38 - of you out I know you all are helping me
20:41 - out I've learned so much from from you
20:44 - since I've started streaming I think
20:45 - this has been the fastest I've ever
20:49 - learned maybe since I've heard you know
20:52 - when you first start you fly through
20:53 - HTML and CSS and think you're awesome
20:55 - like and then you hit JavaScript and
20:58 - they're like can't do anything once you
21:02 - starts to do difficult things so aside
21:07 - from that first early time of rapid
21:11 - rapid learning this has been like
21:15 - amazing because when you all submit code
21:17 - to me I have to try to figure it out I
21:19 - don't want to just pull it in without
21:20 - understanding it so I've been learning
21:23 - quite a lot
21:27 - oh cool rollin said the the Instagram
21:35 - stream is synced with this one that's
21:37 - really cool I'm glad I never thought
21:40 - about it until now but I guess it would
21:42 - be really hard to watch if they were out
21:45 - of sync it would it would be weird so
21:48 - that's cool that it's it's all synced up
21:58 - okay bill said that he used formzee
22:01 - material you I and a react project
22:04 - recently and liked how easy it was to
22:06 - use awesome definitely think I might end
22:09 - up using that
22:30 - okay Sebastian said if I set the initial
22:34 - state to null then this text should show
22:38 - up so am i setting yeah here it is I'm
22:42 - setting state there all right let's
22:48 - check check that out yeah that works
22:53 - okay cool so yeah I'll probably end up
22:58 - changing the color which I was gonna
23:01 - change the color these anyway all of
23:03 - them so I'll just do it when I do that
23:05 - but cool so now the text does appear
23:08 - there and awesome cool thanks for that
23:16 - Sebastian
23:24 - sebastian what's up with the frowny face
23:26 - emoji did I say something that made you
23:33 - said I remember what I was saying
23:47 - Philips hit the Instagram people will be
23:51 - like question mark question mark yeah
23:52 - I've had people pop in on Instagram
23:55 - during the stream before and just type
23:56 - like WTF and then leave they wonder why
24:01 - I'm just here because all you see on the
24:04 - instagrams stream is just me talking not
24:07 - even looking at the stream most of the
24:09 - time I'm looking at my screen and just
24:11 - talking with headphones on so uh I
24:18 - imagine it is kind of weird all right
24:28 - cool
24:29 - aim highs in here and suicide hey how's
24:34 - it going how's the new job yeah let me
24:36 - know I haven't haven't heard from you in
24:38 - a while and also sometimes I call you by
24:44 - whatever your name is on on YouTube but
24:49 - I mean I know what your real names are a
24:52 - lot of times either from github or
24:54 - Twitter or something so if you have a
24:58 - preference if for some reason you don't
25:00 - want me to use your real name on my
25:02 - stream let me know because otherwise
25:04 - I'll probably end up doing it at some
25:06 - point it just reminded me because I
25:09 - always say aim high because that's his
25:11 - name in chat but I do know his real name
25:13 - from Twitter so so let me know if it
25:17 - doesn't matter to you that's cool and
25:19 - I'll just use whichever name and
25:22 - otherwise I don't want to I don't know
25:25 - if somebody's like in the witness
25:26 - protection program or something I don't
25:28 - want to mess things up for you so so let
25:33 - me know if you don't want me to say your
25:35 - name on the stream oh okay John had a
25:42 - good idea the planning guide could be a
25:43 - modal hmm
25:49 - alright I'm gonna think about that if
25:51 - the planning guy pops up as a modal then
25:54 - I don't have to worry about about
25:58 - anything happening to their their data
26:00 - in the form I'm yeah I'm gonna think
26:05 - about that I kind of like that idea
26:09 - especially since I'm gonna condense the
26:12 - planning guide a bit before the Planning
26:15 - guide was spread out over several pages
26:17 - so a modal wouldn't make quite as much
26:19 - sense it would be a lot of information
26:21 - for the modal but we'll see yeah that
26:26 - might that might work
26:34 - Hamza says the link here is is only
26:37 - bolded would it be hard for the user to
26:40 - distinguish between the basically to
26:45 - make to know that that is a link yeah
26:49 - it's possible that it could be difficult
26:51 - I could maybe make it a different color
26:56 - that would be more usually what I would
27:02 - I have done on other sites is the links
27:05 - not just bolded it's actually a
27:06 - completely different color whatever the
27:09 - the main accent color is that I'm using
27:11 - so maybe that would be better to go with
27:14 - a different color I really don't want to
27:18 - put in the the underline the standard
27:20 - default underlined under a link I just
27:23 - don't like how that looks
27:25 - to me if the underlined under the link
27:28 - just looks really really old-school like
27:30 - the early internet and so I don't I
27:34 - don't like it although I I understand
27:37 - that people would immediately see like
27:39 - hey that's a link but if I if I don't if
27:44 - I can get away with not having that and
27:46 - people still understanding it's a link
27:48 - I'd rather do it like that but I do
27:50 - understand what you're saying
28:00 - okay so Kevin says I think you can get
28:03 - away without ejecting by just creating a
28:05 - server das file and changing the NPM
28:08 - start to do NPM run build and then nodes
28:13 - serve Jaso okay cool that's good to know
28:16 - I'd rather not eject if I don't have to
28:21 - so I will I will try that I'm actually
28:24 - I'm gonna copy what you just put in the
28:27 - live chat and paste it somewhere because
28:30 - in case the chat gets really long and
28:33 - that message gets deleted I want to have
28:36 - it so I'm gonna put it right in there
28:54 - cash cash yep says I'm lacking
28:58 - motivation to code I want to but I end
28:59 - up not doing it yeah that's tough I know
29:05 - I've been there I guess trying to think
29:13 - what I do to get motivated it's easier
29:19 - to get motivated now than before I guess
29:22 - when I was freelance because now like I
29:25 - have a boss that could potentially say
29:27 - like what are you doing get to work so
29:31 - that that helps I found when I like
29:39 - motivation usually I'm getting depressed
29:41 - so I need like exercise possibly
29:45 - caffeine but does anyone else have any
29:50 - good ideas for getting motivated you
29:53 - know go ahead and put them in the live
29:55 - chat if if you do okay Sebastian I
30:01 - finally understand why why Sebastian put
30:05 - the the frown emoji in the chat so I had
30:09 - missed the first time that he said gave
30:12 - the solution to to what was going on
30:16 - here so sorry you know sometimes it
30:20 - takes me about to see things in the chat
30:22 - so the chat is is very active right now
30:24 - so I'm gonna have to pull away from it
30:27 - and do some coding here in a minute
30:29 - because we're already a half hour in and
30:33 - I've done very little
30:49 - all right so let me
30:55 - let me do some coding I'll do my I'll
30:58 - set my timer so I'll come back to the
31:00 - live chat whenever my Pomodoro timer is
31:03 - up or if I need your help I'll come back
31:06 - to the live chat you know before it's up
31:10 - which the likelihood of me needing help
31:12 - is really high as as you all know but
31:17 - for now so don't worry if I didn't get
31:19 - you your comment or question and the lab
31:21 - chat I will get to it eventually
31:24 - let's see
31:25 - so actually you know what I want to try
31:31 - first just to see cuz this is this is
31:36 - going to be a big deal I'd like to try
31:38 - this because I'm really curious as to
31:42 - how I would do the custom server stuff
31:48 - yeah
31:53 - yeah let me see where's my package.json
31:56 - file so in case you're you're not
31:59 - familiar with what's going on here maybe
32:02 - if you're just joining or you're not
32:04 - familiar with react so we created this
32:07 - using create react app and that took
32:12 - care of a lot of the setup that goes
32:15 - into like setting up web pack and hot
32:18 - module reloading and a lot of stuff that
32:21 - can be a headache to set up at the
32:23 - beginning the project and you don't
32:26 - really need to know how to do all that
32:27 - if you just want to get started and do
32:29 - something basic with react but if you
32:32 - want to start doing custom things you
32:34 - can't do it by default with create react
32:38 - app because a lot of that stuff is kind
32:39 - of hidden away and that's what makes it
32:42 - so easy to get started with and use but
32:45 - it also makes it difficult to customize
32:47 - so they built in a feature called eject
32:50 - which lets you basically see all that
32:54 - customization stuff once you eject
32:57 - though you can't go back so I'd rather
33:00 - not eject if I don't have to if I'm not
33:04 - a ejected yet I can still update and
33:09 - take advantage of whatever new stuff is
33:12 - coming so it's it's definitely a
33:14 - trade-off I've done it I've done
33:17 - projects where I never ejected and I've
33:20 - also done stuff where I have ejected so
33:23 - I guess it just really depends on what
33:26 - you what you need to do so right now I
33:29 - know that at some point I'm gonna want
33:32 - to do things in my server ojs file I was
33:35 - thinking that I might have to eject but
33:38 - I might maybe I won't have to eject so
33:41 - let's see I wonder
33:51 - I just had a thought could I make a
33:58 - branch in eject the branch and then just
34:05 - see what what happens just see how bad
34:08 - that is and then still have my master
34:11 - branch be not ejected right that could
34:14 - work right let's uh I kind of want to do
34:27 - it now that I've talked about it yeah
34:35 - let's do that actually I really want to
34:38 - show you all what its if you've never
34:39 - done it before seen it like so that you
34:42 - don't have to try to eject one of your
34:43 - own projects and you know potentially
34:45 - mess it up if you don't want to so let's
34:48 - do it on this because I haven't done a
34:52 - project that I've ejected for a long
34:54 - time so yeah let's try it and see what
35:00 - happens
35:01 - what do you think
35:15 - but Sebastian Sebastian recommended just
35:18 - make a copy of the folder the project is
35:21 - in so you don't mess up your get would
35:23 - that mess it up I mean could I would it
35:25 - mess it up that bad that I should
35:27 - completely have a different directory
35:30 - for my project because otherwise I kind
35:34 - of like
35:50 - okay yes it seems like a few people yeah
35:58 - that's what I was thinking
36:00 - Kevin says that worst case you could
36:02 - just delete the node modules and do an
36:04 - NPM install again yeah that's what I was
36:06 - thinking right I can that should work
36:09 - right although now that you all said
36:18 - that maybe it does make a lot of sense
36:21 - that I should that I should do this in a
36:25 - different directory so let me do that
36:28 - where's my where's my terminal that so
36:33 - if you join late and didn't see the link
36:35 - here's the link let me put that I pasted
36:39 - it in really early on like within the
36:41 - first minute so I'm gonna paste it in
36:43 - again just in case cuz you see there's
36:45 - not really a lot of connections open
36:50 - okay so let me go
37:00 - and she's gonna go to
37:12 - all right so I'm gonna pull the project
37:14 - into this folder and then eject it in
37:19 - there and then that way there's no
37:22 - chance that I will mess up what we're
37:23 - actually working on so this would be a
37:27 - good demo of how to pull down projects
37:29 - from get up as well so this might be a
37:31 - good day for beginners a little bit
37:35 - different than what I thought we were
37:37 - gonna do
37:38 - I just noticed today that github is like
37:46 - the first thing on my screen when I open
37:48 - a new tab and I was proud of that like I
37:51 - go to get up more frequently than
37:53 - anything else I was afraid it would be
37:56 - like Netflix or something and then but
38:01 - notice github so I've been working a lot
38:04 - let's see maybe I not CIA Resource
38:09 - Center okay so if you want to clone a
38:13 - repo which I'm sure you've heard me say
38:16 - that before so you go to github and then
38:20 - go to the repo that you want in this
38:22 - case this is what we want and we go to
38:25 - this clone or download button and copy
38:29 - now this depends on how you have it set
38:32 - up if you have your github account set
38:34 - up on your machine with SSH keys you can
38:36 - use this otherwise you can use HTTPS and
38:40 - I think that will prompt you to type in
38:42 - your github password so otherwise with
38:46 - SSH you don't need the password so but
38:51 - either one will work so I've copied that
38:53 - and I'm gonna now I'm in the directory
38:55 - that I want to be in for this and I'm
38:58 - gonna type git clone and I'm going to
39:04 - put that in
39:09 - now let's go Resource Center there you
39:16 - go
39:16 - so here's our files now once you've done
39:18 - that you want to either type in NPM
39:21 - install or Yarn depending on what you
39:24 - want to use if you have yarn and the
39:27 - file has a yarn lock then you probably
39:29 - just want to use yarn but that's
39:32 - entirely up to you so what you would you
39:34 - like to use for that and that's going to
39:36 - take all the stuff in package.json and
39:39 - it's going to install that so otherwise
39:44 - if you try to run this right now it may
39:46 - not work because you don't have actually
39:49 - there's no way it will work I'm pretty
39:50 - sure you have none of the node modules
39:52 - right now generally you don't want to
39:55 - sync your node modules to your github
39:59 - repo that's just kind of a waste since
40:02 - you have your package JSON everybody
40:04 - that downloads it knows what it they
40:06 - need so there's no reason to track your
40:09 - your node module folder okay so now
40:13 - let's type in your and I should have
40:15 - done this immediately so it was working
40:18 - while I was talking so now we're gonna
40:20 - type yourn I just realized that this is
40:22 - really tiny sorry about that and you
40:24 - make it bigger
40:27 - okay so yarn is now getting all the
40:31 - packages and dependencies that it needs
40:33 - and installing them so when yarn is
40:38 - finished we'll have everything we need
40:40 - to run this now what we're gonna do as
40:44 - soon as this finishes it's actually run
40:46 - eject and then we can compare since
40:48 - we'll have both versions open we can
40:51 - compare the file structure just to get
40:53 - an idea of what's different update yarn
40:56 - I get this message a lot I think
41:01 - sometimes either yarn gets updated a lot
41:04 - or I'm doing it wrong
41:14 - okay
41:16 - [Music]
41:21 - I'm gonna open this up in Adam and we
41:30 - see the package.json that we have here
41:32 - which is the same as the one we have on
41:39 - screen so pretty much the same or
41:45 - exactly the same here we go it's exactly
41:50 - the same so when I run it Jack then we
41:52 - can compare and see the differences so
41:55 - let me go back here and I'll run is it
41:58 - just eject yeah so using yarn or NPM or
42:04 - whatever you want I think you can just
42:06 - yarn eject I don't think you have to
42:10 - yarn run eject let's see if this works
42:13 - yep are you sure you want to eject its
42:17 - permanent yes I'm sure
42:20 - ejected successfully that was so fast
42:22 - okay
42:24 - so all this stuff should now be in our
42:33 - our package.json so let's check it out
42:36 - yep all right so now look at all this
42:39 - stuff so we couldn't see a lot of this
42:43 - before and now we can this was all still
42:48 - there behind the scenes it was just kind
42:51 - of hidden to make things a bit more
42:53 - simple okay so now we we actually have
42:57 - you know we have access to all of this
43:00 - what else do we have we have a scripts
43:02 - folder and this has some additional
43:06 - files some additional JavaScript files
43:19 - and we have a config folder
43:28 - so we got a lot of extra stuff we have
43:31 - our webpack configs which like there's a
43:34 - lot of stuff I mean there's a lot of
43:35 - stuff coming it out but there's there's
43:37 - still a lot of stuff in there so you can
43:39 - see it saves you a lot of time and
43:42 - effort configuring configuring all of
43:45 - this but that's what happens when you
43:50 - eject so there we go
44:03 - I'm now that I have ejected now I'm kind
44:15 - of like thinking I definitely don't want
44:17 - to eject if I don't have to because now
44:19 - I remember how crazy it gets when you
44:21 - eject and that all of a sudden there's
44:23 - all this stuff okay
44:34 - so
44:40 - definitely not going to commit that that
44:42 - change so for demonstration purposes we
44:46 - have ejected and now I actually have a
44:48 - another place where I could potentially
44:50 - just switch over and test what's going
44:54 - on you know see how how hard it would be
44:58 - to do it with it ejected so I guess it's
45:02 - beneficial to have that right now not
45:05 - hopefully I won't need to use it though
45:07 - and you can see why it just gets a lot
45:09 - more complex when you have all that
45:11 - they're just my package.json file alone
45:14 - got really big so it looks like how much
45:21 - time okay I'm being on time I'm not I
45:24 - see a lot happening in the live chat and
45:26 - I will check back on that just seen a
45:30 - few of the the comments here I see
45:34 - Patrick says ya know eject yeah you can
45:36 - see it's crazy when you eject
45:38 - it's definitely I'm I'm not I'm not at
45:42 - all an expert at web pack so you know
45:48 - all this kind of stuff I have not really
45:52 - sure what's going on okay so now now I
46:00 - think it's it's obvious to me I think I
46:03 - needed to see that just to know like how
46:08 - worth it is it for me to try to make
46:10 - this work without ejecting and now that
46:12 - I've seen all the extra stuff that
46:14 - happens when you eject like I said I've
46:16 - seen it before but it's been a really
46:17 - long time so I had forgotten but now
46:21 - that I've seen it I'm a little bit more
46:23 - motivated to try to make things work
46:26 - without having to eject so that was
46:29 - useful at least for me hopefully it was
46:30 - useful for you all to to see what what
46:33 - happens when you eject that so let's
46:41 - let's go in now and actually start
46:46 - working with our form
46:58 - okay so here's a question do I once
47:09 - do I want to make these controlled
47:12 - components
47:14 - if I'm gonna use a UI what was that the
47:19 - material UI camera what the name was
47:24 - form Z that was that I think it was form
47:26 - Z this one yeah form Z material you I
47:37 - would this then take care of some of
47:40 - that would I would I end up messing this
47:42 - up if I try to or just from what I'm
47:48 - seeing right here I guess not
48:00 - all right so I do want to kind of test
48:04 - this and read up on it so I'm not going
48:05 - to run this right now so I'm gonna move
48:12 - that off to the side I just don't want
48:15 - to spend a lot of time reading
48:16 - documentation while I'm live-streaming
48:18 - because that's not probably not really
48:24 - beneficial to anyone to stare at my
48:28 - screen while I read something all right
48:31 - so let's let's go where I lost my there
48:41 - it is okay so for our controlled
48:51 - components basically when it end up
48:55 - doing something like this so this is the
49:00 - section on handling multiple inputs
49:01 - which obviously is what we're doing we
49:03 - have a lot of inputs on that page so the
49:06 - way that they're doing it here in the
49:08 - documentation is their adding in in the
49:16 - state
49:24 - the name okay so they're taking the name
49:27 - of the input and then they're using that
49:31 - as the key and then obviously the value
49:34 - of the input is the value and then on
49:37 - their handle they have a handle input
49:39 - change event you can see basically it's
49:45 - kind of nice so they only have to say
49:48 - you know set state once everything else
49:50 - they just make it a Const and then
49:54 - they're able to grab what they need from
49:57 - that event so they can grab the value so
50:00 - you can see they even have you know
50:02 - check box which is great cuz we're gonna
50:04 - have a lot of check boxes so that's cool
50:06 - so I don't really have one I have to
50:08 - make a cost for every single one so
50:11 - hopefully there's a better way to do
50:13 - that because that would be a lot but
50:15 - that's better than having to have a
50:18 - totally different you know called a set
50:21 - state going on so I guess what I need to
50:26 - do is give a name to these inputs
50:30 - because I don't think they have names
50:31 - they don't have IDs or anything so we
50:37 - need to do that before we do anything
50:39 - else because we have no way to identify
50:42 - them so let me see I'm assuming that
50:51 - material UI just passes down the same
50:54 - thing yeah name okay we can just use
50:59 - name like Norma
51:03 - so just give it to a few of these
51:21 - okay so I'm just gonna do a couple just
51:24 - to make sure that this is working and
51:26 - then in our props
51:40 - I guess we'll have we don't really want
51:43 - any of these to have a beginning value
51:45 - right yeah cuz we're using our floating
51:51 - label basically so we don't we don't
51:52 - need a value to begin with so since
51:57 - that'll be a string I guess we'll start
51:58 - out with string what was the next one
52:03 - email okay
52:31 - subscribe this
52:40 - oops let me grab this as well sure you
52:46 - get that first
53:03 - we get semicolons so I'm not gonna
53:12 - manually get rid of the semicolons
53:14 - they'll be you gotten rid of when we
53:17 - commit okay so I think we have we need
53:23 - the on change and other than that I
53:31 - think we have everything
53:43 - let me change
53:59 - okay I misread this completely so I was
54:05 - very mistaken a few minutes ago so let
54:07 - me correct and I'm sure you've already
54:10 - corrected me in a live chat so I misread
54:13 - this so I apologize I was reading over
54:17 - this hastily before the stream was about
54:20 - to start so and I misread this somehow
54:25 - thinking that I would have to make a
54:28 - Const for each one which I thought
54:31 - seemed a bit ridiculous and in fact it
54:33 - was ridiculous because that's not even
54:35 - what they were doing so it looks like I
54:37 - won't have to do that so what's
54:41 - happening with these cost is so this is
54:46 - the target I don't know what I was
54:49 - thinking now it seems so obvious to me I
54:52 - guess that happens sometimes I didn't
54:54 - have any caffeine until just right when
54:57 - I started this dream so I'm gonna blame
54:58 - it on that I've got my G fuel no so now
55:05 - my brain is working
55:06 - okay so we're grabbing the event okay
55:12 - we're getting the target and we're
55:13 - saving that to a variable now we're
55:15 - using that to get the value so we can
55:23 - set that if it equals checkbox right
55:30 - then we're gonna get target checked
55:32 - otherwise else right we're gonna get
55:36 - target value okay and that's because for
55:39 - for the other inputs we can just grab
55:41 - the value and that'll give us the value
55:43 - of the input but for checkboxes it's
55:45 - different so we just there's we don't
55:47 - check the value of it we just want to
55:49 - know whether it's checked or not all
55:51 - right and that's gonna be a boolean so
55:56 - this makes a lot more sense now then we
56:01 - want to get the name and that's what
56:04 - we're using here so we're gonna get the
56:05 - name and the
56:09 - that makes so much sense sorry sorry for
56:13 - being such an idiot a few minutes ago so
56:17 - I'm sure those of you who know what
56:19 - you're doing with with you know with
56:22 - react knew immediately that I didn't
56:25 - know what I was talking about but I
56:27 - really apologize to those of you who are
56:29 - new I probably confuse you quite a bit
56:31 - I myself was confused so sorry about
56:35 - that so it seems like now we actually do
56:38 - have everything we'll need so let's just
56:39 - try it out and see see if we're actually
56:44 - gonna be able to change the state so I'm
56:47 - just gonna type in some nonsense here
56:49 - and then we're gonna check the state let
56:57 - me inspect this and then I'll bring over
56:59 - dev tools assuming it worked I'll bring
57:04 - it over and be impressive if it didn't
57:06 - work I'll just won't even show it but it
57:09 - did work okay so let me make it bigger
57:16 - okay so you can see here's the state for
57:20 - a component our service request
57:21 - component here's our state we have email
57:24 - we have and this is our the nonsense
57:29 - that I just typed in for all of them
57:30 - okay but we have email name phone number
57:33 - and that's exactly what need so we have
57:37 - all these values and let me see if I can
57:41 - let's do this in real time so you can
57:46 - see a change you can see the flash of
57:48 - kind of a green color under name as it
57:53 - changes
57:59 - so very cool so real-time you know on
58:03 - change it updates state awesome now I
58:08 - just realized that we in fact did not
58:11 - add the value like I said we are going
58:16 - to do so let me do that really quick
58:19 - value equals
58:30 - okay I should probably check the
58:33 - documentation to make sure I did that
58:34 - right but I'm pretty sure that's how it
58:36 - was let's make sure that still works
58:42 - okay cool
58:44 - now if I want to go I wonder if it will
58:47 - let me change the state right here in
58:51 - dev tools it'll be really cool if it
58:54 - does
59:12 - there we go okay let me see if I can
59:16 - change it cool all right so you say I
59:23 - change state here in dev tools and then
59:27 - it changed it here so we can see since I
59:31 - didn't set the value on this looks like
59:34 - the phone element it shouldn't change
59:37 - okay see so it doesn't change so that's
59:41 - what I was trying to explain at the
59:42 - beginning of the stream kind of the flow
59:46 - that it was gonna take was the value is
59:51 - gonna be set by the state and the state
59:53 - is set by what you type in here so
59:56 - hopefully that demonstrated that now my
59:59 - timer did go off a minute ago so I'm
60:02 - gonna go back to the live chat and all
60:09 - right and the it's been an hour of
60:12 - stream because my Instagram live stream
60:15 - just stopped because there's an hour
60:18 - limit so Wow I had 11 viewers so that's
60:23 - pretty good I mean not nowhere near what
60:26 - we get for the for the YouTube stream
60:29 - but I mean that says as I expected but
60:35 - that's cool I mean I I just kind of want
60:38 - to give people the opportunity to see
60:40 - what I look like in case they're
60:43 - interested
60:44 - sometimes we sometimes that's nice
60:48 - instead of just hearing someone's voice
60:50 - to be able to put a face with it and I
60:54 - don't know about you but it's always
60:56 - really hard for me to read like what
60:59 - somebody is is feeling if I can't see
61:02 - their face like are they being are they
61:03 - serious or they joking or happy like
61:06 - it's hard to tell so if you've if you
61:12 - can see their face it's kind of easier
61:15 - so I'll tell you I I'm actually smiling
61:19 - a lot when I do this dream so I really
61:21 - like doing this so that's normally my
61:24 - expression
61:27 - all right so I'm scrolling up in the
61:30 - live chat it looks like I can still read
61:33 - the stuff at the top so that's good so I
61:35 - won't miss anyone's anyone's questions
61:39 - or comments
61:52 - I just saw well earlier when I was
61:56 - saying I won't say your name on on-air
62:00 - if you don't want me to and I've
62:03 - mentioned the witness protection program
62:04 - role and so that escalated quickly
62:06 - witness protection it did I mean I was I
62:10 - was just trying to think of some reason
62:11 - why someone wouldn't want me to say the
62:13 - real name that's the first thing that
62:16 - came to mind okay Sebastian says I need
62:21 - to remove exact in the link and check
62:24 - console so I guess I'm getting an error
62:27 - I have dev tools up now so let's check
62:30 - that out
62:31 - okay I'm gonna prop exact on the a tag
62:34 - this drop from the other man link okay
62:39 - never remove that I will remove that
62:46 - right now so don't forget
62:54 - yeah honor when I was doing this I
62:56 - couldn't I remembered that I had to put
62:58 - exact in somewhere when I was using
63:00 - reactor outer but I couldn't remember
63:02 - exactly where or how to put it in and I
63:04 - didn't bother looking it up and I put it
63:07 - in and at work so I just left it at that
63:09 - and I didn't even check the console so
63:11 - thanks for that Sebastian
63:25 - okay cool so Tiffany said when we were
63:28 - talking about the link and making sure
63:30 - that people knew that that really was a
63:32 - link so this this year this planning
63:35 - guide link which is this so Tiffany said
63:40 - a different color different color text
63:43 - triggers
63:43 - hey that's the link to so okay cool
63:48 - I agree thanks for the feedback okay it
63:55 - looks like Rohan agrees as well maybe
63:59 - use some other highlight color for the
64:01 - link okay cool
64:21 - oh man brah brian says yarn or NPM and
64:26 - why I'm knowledge I wonder wonder if any
64:34 - like a huge debate got started let me
64:36 - see it doesn't look like it oh man I was
64:40 - I was afraid there's gonna be this giant
64:42 - debate about your honor NPM it looks
64:44 - like there wasn't occasionally that's
64:46 - happened about code editors somebody
64:49 - mentions a code editor and then the live
64:51 - chat is just filled with people talking
64:53 - about their favorite editor or usually
64:57 - it's not even their favorite editor it's
64:58 - whatever editor they don't like and they
65:01 - talk about why it's bad so I actually
65:04 - like an answer to Brian's question
65:08 - I like yarn but I've heard that the
65:11 - newest version of NPM has some of the
65:14 - features that yarn has and it's also
65:16 - fast so I liked yarn because it has the
65:18 - yarn lock file and because it was faster
65:20 - than NPM but if that's not true anymore
65:23 - an NPM actually has a similar file and
65:26 - it's just as fast or faster then it
65:29 - probably makes more sense to just use
65:31 - NPM since you get you'd have it anyway
65:34 - instead of installing yarn in addition
65:36 - to that so maybe I'll I'll have to check
65:41 - out the newest version of NPM and see
65:43 - what I think about it and then I might
65:46 - actually switch away from yarn but for
65:47 - now I'm gonna stick with yarn until I
65:50 - get the time to check it out check out
65:54 - MTM again the newest version
66:06 - okay so we had a question earlier about
66:10 - you know how to stay motivated to code
66:13 - when you don't feel like coding umberto
66:15 - says I watch people create things or
66:17 - tutorial videos about stuff I'm
66:18 - interested in to get motivated so that's
66:21 - that's cool
66:23 - I don't even think about that it's a
66:25 - good idea I guess that would be
66:26 - motivating like just to remind remind
66:30 - yourself of the cool things that you can
66:33 - do yeah that is cool it is really
66:37 - amazing like coding is about you just
66:39 - get to create things like Withers
66:41 - there's nothing there and you just you
66:44 - start typing code and all things happen
66:46 - that's really cool and then you can you
66:54 - can just mess with it and start over
66:56 - completely and it doesn't matter if you
66:57 - break it does you it's just really cool
67:00 - there's not really a lot that you could
67:02 - do that's like that you could compare
67:04 - that to just the flexibility of it I say
67:09 - I said I listen to Johnny Cash to get
67:11 - motivated oh cool Don Xavier says
67:15 - motivated nothing like some nice tunes
67:18 - got to work with tunes and coffee okay
67:21 - cool
67:22 - yo so says he should get engaged with
67:25 - his peers okay yeah that's I do I agree
67:27 - with the music thing and the coffee
67:29 - thing as well but then also Joseph's
67:33 - comment about getting engaged with peers
67:36 - that can be really good I'm I I would I
67:45 - guess I don't have a lot of experience
67:46 - with having peers that also code because
67:50 - I mostly code by myself it's and I'm not
67:56 - like working with other people in
67:58 - project until now that I'm working with
68:00 - all of you
68:00 - so that actually is motivation for me
68:03 - that I know I'm gonna do the stream and
68:06 - so I wanna I want to get better and know
68:10 - more what I'm doing so I could be more
68:12 - helpful to you all but I know like
68:18 - when I I don't I don't often work out as
68:21 - much as I should
68:22 - nowadays but when I was younger I used
68:26 - to work out all the time and if you have
68:31 - a partner or some people that you work
68:33 - out with you're way less likely to skip
68:35 - a workout and I imagine it's probably
68:38 - the same thing if you have other people
68:40 - that you code with and you talk about
68:42 - coding with you're way less likely to
68:43 - stop coding because they will encourage
68:47 - you and call you out if you don't and
68:50 - you'll have like positive motivation to
68:53 - want to have new things to talk about
68:54 - when you see them so that's definitely a
68:57 - good idea
69:01 - let's see Hamza says why don't you use
69:07 - template strings man they're so better
69:12 - actually I'm not sure I can't remember
69:15 - what I was doing when that comment came
69:17 - up so Hamza I'm sorry I'm not sure what
69:19 - you're referring to with the template
69:25 - strings thing so normally I do use
69:27 - template strings or template literal
69:30 - syntax I use that almost all the time
69:35 - unless it's something really simple and
69:37 - then I just use sometimes I'll just use
69:40 - normal like string concatenation Tiffany
69:45 - says listen to upbeat music while you
69:47 - work suggestion to Door Cinema Club okay
69:51 - never heard that I'll have to check it
69:53 - out Phillip says try the Neo method
69:57 - electronic actually I I listened I
70:03 - listened to a lot of different music
70:05 - when I code so depending on the day I
70:08 - could be listening to anything it's the
70:11 - only music that I probably never listen
70:14 - to is country music so don't like
70:18 - country music but pretty much anything
70:20 - else I like but I K I do listen to
70:25 - electronic music today I listen to a lot
70:28 - of lecture
70:28 - music I don't know about anyone here but
70:36 - if I really want to get motivated I
70:38 - listen to music from the Rocky movies so
70:42 - I don't if you've ever seen any of the
70:44 - Rocky movies a lot of them came out I
70:47 - think they started coming out in the
70:49 - seventies some came out in the 80s and
70:51 - then they started making new ones within
70:53 - the last 10 years or so but the
70:57 - soundtracks always get me fired up I
70:59 - remember watching those movies when I
71:00 - was a kid and getting so pumped up so
71:02 - uh-huh so that that helps me maybe if
71:06 - there's some something like that that
71:08 - you have like strong emotions with when
71:10 - you hear it that could probably help you
71:12 - out
71:22 - alright Isaiah says how important is it
71:25 - to know graph QL for a react developer
71:29 - I don't know graph QL and the take the
71:36 - truth I never considered myself a react
71:38 - developer but maybe I should think about
71:40 - it because I'm building sites for my job
71:45 - and for clients on the side with react
71:47 - so I'm not really sure how you define
71:50 - react developer but I develop sites with
71:52 - react so maybe I am I don't I don't know
71:55 - but anyway that's not really the
71:58 - question honestly I do think graph QL is
72:02 - really cool from what I've read about it
72:04 - I do want to learn it and I think that
72:06 - it's going to be used more so like if I
72:08 - had to guess I would say a graph QL is
72:10 - going to be the thing that people use it
72:13 - seems like it makes a lot more sense I
72:16 - mean I like REST API as I love working
72:18 - with REST API so they're really easy to
72:19 - work with but a graph QL does seem like
72:22 - it makes more sense than the REST API is
72:27 - just in terms of like you can get
72:30 - exactly the data you want and less trips
72:32 - so it seems like there would be less
72:36 - waste in terms of getting data that you
72:39 - really don't need and making a lot of
72:42 - extra trips
72:43 - whereas with graph QL you could probably
72:45 - get exactly the data you need in one
72:47 - trip so I think graph QL is important is
72:52 - it necessary to know definitely not it's
72:56 - important I don't know I think it's
72:59 - pretty important I think right now you
73:01 - definitely don't need to know it but I
73:05 - think it's going to be more used more
73:08 - more and more as you come or more people
73:13 - adopt it and I don't know that's just my
73:17 - my guess but I mean who knows what's
73:19 - gonna happen something else better could
73:20 - come out in a week and then we'll forget
73:23 - about graph QL but I would I would say
73:25 - if you have the time to learn it and you
73:28 - want to learn it then go for it
73:31 - Rowen says by the way the upload file
73:33 - list is not scrollable might get people
73:35 - confuse
73:36 - okay cool I'm gonna move this over the
73:38 - other screen just in case I have like
73:40 - some top-secret files actually I just I
73:44 - don't have anything crazy but I do have
73:46 - files that are like the names of people
73:48 - who have applied to for the web
73:50 - developer job so I don't want to put
73:51 - their names on YouTube so I'm gonna open
73:53 - this on my other screen just in case
73:56 - okay I'm cool I just have I'll bring
74:00 - this back I just have my thumbnails for
74:04 - all my videos here so let's open this
74:07 - let me open a bunch of them and see
74:15 - what's going on here
74:17 - okay so you're saying it's not
74:19 - scrollable for this list okay
74:23 - yeah people might get confused I'm not I
74:26 - don't really know offhand how I would
74:29 - make this scrollable
74:32 - onna maybe I could do something with CSS
74:35 - with the overflow yeah maybe I could do
74:42 - something with the overflow property so
74:43 - I will add that to the list
74:55 - and I'm gonna give that a one Pomodoro
74:57 - cycle because in case my first idea
75:00 - doesn't work it might take a little bit
75:01 - longer
75:02 - alright cool thanks for that Rohan I'm
75:06 - actually really glad I finally like kind
75:08 - of set this up because it is a lot
75:10 - easier for me to just put something in
75:13 - here instead of forgetting about it
75:25 - okay let me see man I just look there's
75:28 - a lot of stuff going on the live chat I
75:30 - want to make sure I get to all of it but
75:34 - probably be a good idea to do a bit more
75:38 - with this
75:46 - let me think what I need
76:02 - actually you know what I'm kind of
76:04 - thinking there's not really anything
76:09 - that everything that I'm gonna do at
76:12 - this point for a while is just gonna be
76:13 - repetition so I'm just gonna be doing
76:16 - the same thing that I did with this to
76:18 - all of these and then at that point I
76:24 - would maybe start working on something
76:27 - else related to this so I think I'm kind
76:30 - of at the point where by the time I
76:32 - would get all this done I would want to
76:34 - end the stream anyway so instead of just
76:37 - repeating the exact same thing that I
76:39 - did which I don't think would be very
76:41 - helpful I think I'm gonna take the
76:43 - questions us simply because the there's
76:46 - so much in the live chat I'm only
76:47 - halfway through everything that was in
76:49 - there so I definitely want to get to the
76:52 - questions also I might I do kind of want
76:56 - to get out of work at a decent time
76:57 - because I think I need to go to the
77:00 - doctor's so I actually I hurt my wrist
77:07 - so I don't know you might have noticed
77:09 - if you watched on the Instagram feed
77:11 - that I was holding my wrist so told my
77:14 - right hand and I'm right-handed and
77:17 - maybe like a month ago I was like
77:20 - playing with my kids in the pool when I
77:22 - was throwing them and at some point like
77:26 - after I've been throwing them for a
77:27 - really long time and I was tired I
77:29 - lifted one of them up and I just felt
77:31 - something like it's pain in my wrist and
77:33 - I just tried to be tough and say like oh
77:37 - that's no big deal
77:38 - it'll be fine and I never did anything
77:40 - about it and it slowly gotten worse and
77:43 - worse every day to the point now where
77:45 - if I use my wrist at all it hurts and
77:50 - that's a problem because obviously like
77:52 - I I need to move my wrist around like
77:56 - even moving my wrist around to select
78:00 - things you know like on the screen you
78:03 - know to move the cursor around hurts so
78:05 - I think I probably ought to go to the
78:07 - doctor's just on the off chance that
78:10 - maybe something serious
78:13 - at least maybe should get like some sort
78:15 - of brace or something so that I can not
78:17 - move it as much because right now it's
78:20 - just really hard not to move it like I
78:22 - always some like picking up the baby
78:24 - you're doing something and I just keep
78:27 - making it worse anyway enough about that
78:30 - I'm sure no one watches this for my
78:33 - health updates
78:39 - let's see but I guess it is it is a good
78:42 - lesson if you're a developer you need
78:47 - your hands most likely to work so take
78:52 - care of them and don't put off getting
78:55 - them checked out if you've heard
78:57 - something alright so at this point if
79:04 - you are here for the code and you don't
79:05 - want to stick around for the question
79:06 - and answer session thank you so much for
79:08 - watching and you can you can safely tune
79:12 - out probably won't be doing any more
79:15 - coding and I'll be back tomorrow most
79:18 - likely at the same time otherwise if you
79:21 - can stick around for a little bit longer
79:24 - and have a question or want to help out
79:26 - and answering some questions then check
79:28 - out the live chat put your question in
79:30 - there if you're shy you can just direct
79:32 - message me on Twitter and I'll try to
79:33 - get you a question whenever I can or if
79:37 - you can't stick around to hear my answer
79:39 - you can either catch the answer later on
79:41 - if you watch the recording of this or
79:43 - you can message me some other way on
79:45 - Twitter or some other social media the
79:47 - link for my Twitter is in the
79:49 - description okay I hadn't said that in a
79:53 - while so I figured I may as well say it
79:55 - for anyone that's new and doesn't know
79:58 - how the stream kind of works so
80:01 - unofficially the stream is split up into
80:03 - two parts the code part and the question
80:06 - and answer part all right so we're still
80:13 - talking about in in regard to the
80:17 - motivation thing so well Mary says I
80:22 - have have a few things that help with
80:24 - motivate
80:25 - group co-working not so much teamwork
80:28 - but working around other people working
80:30 - so sharing that working energy oh that's
80:33 - cool
80:34 - yeah I could I can see that so maybe
80:38 - actually I have rarely done this but I
80:41 - see a lot of people especially like
80:44 - coders on Instagram always for posting
80:46 - pictures of them working at a cafe or
80:49 - something with other people so I don't
80:53 - do that a lot just because where I'm at
80:55 - there's not really a lot of cafes with
80:57 - good Wi-Fi that you could go and work at
81:00 - this it's not not an option for me but I
81:06 - think that's kind of at least it seems
81:08 - popular from from what I see online so
81:15 - good advice thank you
81:18 - Yosef says by the way I'm learning Ajax
81:21 - and listen to your live coding in the
81:23 - background to help me to get motivated
81:25 - oh cool all right so I guess my live
81:29 - coding can be motivation as well I could
81:35 - definitely see my live coding being
81:36 - motivation for somebody saying like how
81:38 - how does this guy have a live stream on
81:41 - YouTube that people watch and like I'm
81:44 - better than him how does this okay I
81:48 - could see people being motivated by that
81:52 - but anyway I appreciate that appreciate
81:57 - you saying that
81:58 - well Patrick says the brain food Spotify
82:02 - playlist off to check that out I don't
82:04 - know if I've listened to the brain food
82:05 - playlist maybe I have at some point yeah
82:11 - definitely if you um if you like
82:15 - listening to music and you can spare the
82:17 - I don't know like ten dollars or less a
82:21 - month to get Spotify Premium I
82:23 - definitely recommend that and I this is
82:25 - not sponsored by Spotify this is my
82:28 - honest opinion my productivity went up
82:32 - when I got Spotify Premium because the
82:34 - commercials got so annoying for me it
82:36 - broke my train of thought
82:38 - and it really did help to get spotify
82:42 - premium so i think that's a legitimate
82:43 - business expense so if you don't have it
82:47 - try it out sometimes they have really
82:50 - good deals where you can get like three
82:51 - months for 99 cents a month or something
82:53 - like that so try it out whenever one of
82:56 - those deals happen that that really
83:00 - helped me out
83:13 - Rohan says working with a couple of
83:16 - people who are motivated enough can be a
83:18 - push for everyone but teams generally
83:20 - take motivation away okay that's
83:22 - interesting so yeah I can agree with
83:27 - that I guess it depends on who you're
83:29 - working with on your team I would say
83:31 - there there are some people and some
83:33 - personalities that are just a drain on
83:36 - the team but then sometimes there are
83:38 - people that are just so positive that it
83:42 - it does help I know there there used to
83:44 - be someone that worked in my department
83:46 - and she retired but even now when I see
83:49 - her every time I see her she tells me oh
83:52 - Jessie you're so smart you can do
83:55 - anything you're going places and she
83:58 - always says that I always laugh you know
83:59 - but that makes me feel so good about
84:03 - myself and she's she's not I mean she I
84:06 - think genuinely believes that and she
84:10 - would convince me like once I applied
84:12 - for a job that was way out of my league
84:14 - and it was partly because she convinced
84:16 - me and talked me up that I that I should
84:18 - do it that I would be great at it so
84:20 - people like that can help you be
84:22 - motivated really positive upbeat people
84:24 - I think are great for motivating you so
84:30 - if you have people like that in your
84:31 - life hang out around them more often or
84:34 - try to find somebody like that and make
84:37 - them your friend
84:45 - okay it looks like okay cool so Kevin is
84:52 - giving me some some links I'm gonna copy
84:56 - these and check these out after the
85:02 - stream okay all right I see this one
85:07 - definitely looks helpful is exactly what
85:09 - we want to do using create react app
85:13 - with react router and Express j/s this
85:15 - this is exactly what we're doing okay
85:18 - cool so thank you thank you Kevin
85:21 - definitely gonna check that out
85:25 - yeah Rowan says node modules isn't
85:27 - traced by get yeah actually so by it by
85:31 - default node modules can be traced but I
85:33 - get so you you do have to put it in your
85:35 - git ignore file so let me let me show
85:38 - you this actually because I do see this
85:40 - occasionally the people will have their
85:43 - node modules in their repo so it's
85:46 - really easy fix here within your get
85:50 - ignore file if you don't have this in
85:54 - your project like you can just copy it
85:57 - from somebody else's project that's
85:59 - similar to yours if you need to I never
86:03 - make these from scratch I always copy it
86:06 - from either a previous project of mine
86:07 - or a similar project I have someone
86:10 - else's and you want to say don't track
86:13 - node modules and then you know there's
86:17 - other stuff in here this one was created
86:19 - automatically when I did create react
86:21 - app but if you were doing the project
86:26 - from scratch then this wouldn't be there
86:29 - automatically so you would have to put
86:30 - it in if you happen to do your project
86:35 - and setup get and forget to do this
86:37 - first and then you want to ignore your
86:41 - files later on you got you have to run a
86:43 - few commands to get that to work so let
86:46 - me I actually just did this some someone
86:49 - wanted me to take a look at their
86:50 - project and so I I cloned it and the
86:54 - node modules were being tracked so
86:57 - I sent a pool request basically just
87:00 - uploading a GUID ignore I think I
87:02 - changed a few other things but one of
87:04 - the things I changed for them was I put
87:06 - this in so let me let me just show you
87:08 - how to do that quickly I guess I'm not
87:13 - well I'm not going to be able to show
87:15 - you because obviously I have it I have
87:18 - it set up the right way but let me show
87:24 - you where I guess I can at least give
87:25 - you the resource that I use because it's
87:31 - happened in the several times so it
87:33 - would be useful let's see
87:54 - I'm trying to tape on my other screen to
87:58 - show you this resource but I can't type
88:03 - today
88:09 - so all right there we go so what you
88:14 - want to do is get you want to do a git
88:24 - RM cache and then you can put the name
88:30 - of your file if it's just one file or
88:34 - like let's say you just you didn't have
88:37 - this at all and there's a bunch of stuff
88:38 - and now you upload your get ignore file
88:41 - or you create your get ignore file then
88:44 - you can just do like alright you want to
88:48 - do the die you want to do everything and
88:51 - then you can go ahead with adding your
88:57 - your other files so you can do a git
89:01 - status it'll show you everything and
89:02 - then you want to add and then push the
89:04 - changes so I'm pretty sure that's how
89:06 - I've done it before I just I was looking
89:10 - for that command so that's what you want
89:13 - to do to get everything back back in
89:19 - order and let me know I'm sure you'll
89:21 - let me know in the live chat if I've
89:23 - missed something here and someone has
89:27 - noticed that I'm missing something
89:28 - important but there's like there's a ton
89:31 - of Stack Overflow questions about that
89:34 - so I'm sure you'll you'll be able to
89:37 - find something you know if you need a
89:40 - little bit more instruction on that ok
89:44 - Dixie says I find watching Jesse's live
89:47 - streams give me gets me motivated seeing
89:49 - him go through the errors and everything
89:51 - is comforting to me at least a hug good
89:54 - food food and music can help too yeah I
89:57 - like that comment I've had a few times
90:03 - I've had people say like that they they
90:08 - like that I make mistakes and work
90:11 - through them and I really I like that
90:13 - comment because that was really my one
90:15 - of like the the main points of this was
90:18 - to show people that I make mistakes and
90:21 - because a lot of your tutorial
90:23 - videos like they edit out any mistakes
90:25 - right you know you want to keep the
90:27 - videos as short as possible and to the
90:29 - point so you edit out the mistakes so I
90:31 - wanted people to see the mistakes so you
90:34 - know they don't get the impression that
90:35 - if they're making mistakes somehow
90:38 - there's something wrong with them when
90:40 - in reality we all make mistakes all the
90:42 - time but it's always funny when I get
90:45 - that because I know people mean it as a
90:48 - compliment but in the back of my mind
90:50 - I'm thinking like like everybody likes
90:55 - just watching me mess up and I know
90:57 - that's not how you how you all mean it
90:59 - but it's just funny to me that in in a
91:02 - sense that's true right like the main
91:04 - draw of this live stream is the fact
91:08 - that I mess up and try to work through
91:09 - it so I don't know maybe it's just me
91:14 - but I think that's kind of that's kind
91:16 - of funny it's amusing but anyway
91:19 - Dixie thanks for saying that I'm glad
91:22 - that that that's comforting to you
91:24 - that's that that's definitely what I
91:26 - what I intend is you know for people to
91:29 - feel a little bit better when they make
91:31 - a mistake because they see me make so
91:34 - many
91:43 - John Hanson said you're gonna need some
91:45 - heavy metal music before going before
91:48 - you hit that Enter key to eject so yeah
91:52 - if I would have seen that I could have
91:54 - switched to some some heavy metal but I
91:58 - think I didn't see it in time so
92:04 - actually my Spotify stopped I made it
92:06 - through this big playlist and so just
92:09 - stops I just restarted it again Patrick
92:16 - says what is the point of using it if
92:19 - you can't feel confident that you can
92:20 - branch an experiment just use a branch
92:22 - you can always clone from github yeah
92:25 - that's what I thought that's what I
92:29 - thought too at first Patrick it was
92:31 - actually kind of cool the way I did it
92:32 - in another folder and then it was easier
92:36 - to compare them side-by-side I know I
92:37 - could have just switched back and forth
92:38 - from the branches but I'm I'm actually
92:42 - like a little bit interested in going in
92:46 - now to that where the the other
92:49 - directory where I each acted and just
92:51 - messing with things and possibly
92:56 - breaking it but I don't know to me now I
93:00 - like inadvertently have a little
93:01 - playground now that I can mess with all
93:03 - the configurations so I'm kind of I'm
93:06 - thinking if I get a little bit of time I
93:07 - can go mess around and maybe learn
93:09 - webpack a bit a bit better so anyway it
93:14 - turned out alright I definitely agree
93:15 - like I I had figured I could just make a
93:18 - branch and then I was kind of
93:21 - second-guessing myself there and just
93:23 - went with the entirely safe route but
93:28 - for future reference for anybody it
93:30 - should have been fine to just make a
93:32 - branch and do do the eject on the branch
93:35 - and I could have just switched back and
93:36 - or Kalandar
93:38 - so so I do I do great Patrick and Kevin
93:44 - looks like Kevin was agreeing with
93:45 - Patrick as well aha I mentioned earlier
93:50 - that when I open up a new tab its
93:52 - it's github its first and I said that I
93:55 - was I was proud of that I was afraid it
93:57 - would be Netflix rhoann says his Netflix
94:00 - I don't mean anything bad by that if
94:02 - you're if you tab who's Netflix that's I
94:04 - like Netflix to although my Netflix
94:07 - isn't hasn't been working I suspect that
94:09 - my wife canceled the Netflix account and
94:12 - didn't tell me I keep forgetting that to
94:17 - ask her about it but every time I try to
94:18 - watch Netflix for the last like few days
94:20 - it hasn't worked but anyway don't feel
94:26 - bad if yours is his Netflix on the
94:28 - merits this is my work computer by the
94:33 - way so maybe that would that would make
94:36 - a difference I never watch Netflix on
94:39 - this computer
94:48 - haha bill said is his local host haha
94:52 - that's awesome that's that's a that's
94:57 - really cool
95:05 - oh that's right okay so I see Kevin says
95:08 - you don't need a password not even a
95:10 - github account to clone just to push
95:12 - that's right thanks Kevin thank you for
95:17 - clarifying that anyway I don't know what
95:21 - I was thinking but when I went in when I
95:24 - when I showed you all how to clone from
95:26 - github I mistakenly said that if he went
95:30 - with the HTTPS you would have to put in
95:33 - your password but that was wrong you
95:35 - only need your password if you were to
95:37 - then try to push to a repo that you've
95:40 - cloned with the HTTPS so don't worry
95:44 - about you can clone and as as Kevin said
95:47 - in the live chat you don't even need to
95:49 - have a github account to clone using the
95:54 - HTTP link so forget what I said earlier
95:58 - that was a mistake
96:00 - hopefully hopefully I didn't mislead
96:03 - anyone there but yet only if you're
96:08 - going to push does the password come
96:10 - into play so sorry about that
96:43 - okay so aim high says have you finished
96:46 - your react nano degree course so that
96:49 - was asked a while ago so not sure if
96:52 - you're still around to get the answer
96:54 - but I haven't finished it yet so the way
96:56 - it the way it works is the courses
97:02 - don't start so like I started the first
97:05 - part I just wanna show you how this
97:10 - works
97:23 - basically the courses are split up and
97:26 - they have start dates so I finished the
97:31 - first part so the curriculum here I
97:34 - finished react the introduction and
97:38 - react fundamentals but the next section
97:41 - react and redux starts in six days 21
97:46 - hours 22 minutes and 14 seconds so I
97:49 - can't take it now so I have been doing
97:52 - some of the extracurricular stuff so I
97:53 - started like the ex6 es6
97:57 - things so these are just like you don't
98:00 - need to do these to complete the course
98:02 - but they're just in addition which i
98:03 - think is cool so they have stuff on here
98:05 - 6 asynchronous JavaScript getting github
98:07 - and then career feedback stuff so like
98:10 - helping you with your resume you get up
98:12 - profile LinkedIn so I'm gonna work on
98:15 - these when I have time until the next
98:18 - one gets up and running so this one is
98:20 - starts in six days and then the last one
98:23 - react native doesn't start to 441 days
98:25 - so I will not be through with this
98:27 - course anytime soon but anyway that's
98:32 - how it works so I was I was a little bit
98:36 - surprised cuz the other some of the
98:38 - other courses don't work like this this
98:40 - was this is different so not everything
98:42 - on Udacity works like this
98:54 - all right so me media mij a not sure how
98:59 - to pronounce that so I'm gonna say media
99:01 - but I'm pretty sure that's not right so
99:04 - let me know how you would like me to
99:08 - pronounce that but anyway the question
99:11 - is what is enjoy what is the enjoyable
99:14 - part of doing react app don don xavier
99:20 - says simplicity and decoupling for me at
99:23 - least and youth so yeah I guess I mean
99:33 - what am I like right I don't know I kind
99:37 - of like react there's some features of
99:39 - react that we're really useful to me
99:42 - so like server-side rendering so being
99:45 - able to do server-side rendering which
99:47 - is not a new thing right like you can
99:48 - server-side render and other link like
99:50 - PHP you know like but being able to
99:53 - service that render and then use the all
99:56 - the same stuff to do client-side
100:01 - client-side routing that's really cool
100:06 - and useful I like that I kind of I I
100:11 - thought it was weird at first to mix in
100:14 - JavaScript and HTML and CSS but now I
100:17 - think it's kind of cool to do it all in
100:18 - one place and have it all like all
100:21 - together for each component so that's
100:24 - that's really cool if I probably if I
100:27 - thought about it more I would think of
100:28 - some other things but just off the top
100:29 - of my head that's that's kind of what I
100:31 - like what's what's enjoyable for me
100:33 - about it and acts honestly this might
100:38 - sound bad but if I'm being totally
100:40 - honest react is just like the cool thing
100:44 - to do right now I mean this is not a
100:47 - good reason to choose something so I
100:49 - think react is good in itself but it is
100:52 - a little bit cool to be like doing the
100:55 - using the thing that everybody is
100:58 - talking about on Twitter and stuff right
101:00 - like I'm not saying that that's a good
101:02 - reason but I'm just saying that that's
101:04 - that's a bonus right whenever you know
101:08 - ever I can honestly say that like I'm
101:10 - using technology that's being used by
101:13 - some of the big tech companies and some
101:15 - of the latest like coolest things that
101:17 - are coming out I like being able to say
101:19 - that right that's that's nice that I
101:21 - don't I never like saying like yeah I'm
101:24 - building stuff with technology that's
101:26 - outdated right that's not I would never
101:29 - want to say that hey I would never say
101:32 - that with pride right but it's it's kind
101:34 - of cool to say like hey react is a
101:36 - somewhat new technology that is being
101:39 - adopted by a lot of like cutting-edge
101:41 - companies and I'm using that so that's
101:45 - really that's kind of cool too like I
101:48 - said not not the reason you'd never want
101:50 - to pick something just because you think
101:52 - it's cool or you know popular at the
101:54 - moment but it's a bonus if the thing
101:57 - that you like for other you know reasons
102:00 - also is cool okay me just said this
102:06 - looks like suffering but I support
102:09 - efforts yeah I guess it may look like
102:18 - suffering it sometimes but sometimes
102:21 - like stuff works and it works out well
102:24 - and it's really cool so yes it just
102:27 - depends depends on what you're doing
102:43 - all right don't Savior so seeing this
102:46 - for the first time it looks like a
102:47 - rollercoaster ride but once you delve
102:49 - into it it's simple yeah yeah I mean it
102:53 - does it gets a lot easier bill says I
102:57 - had to come back to react about three
102:59 - times before I finally click now it's my
103:01 - go-to when doing any project to the
103:04 - point where if I sit down to write plain
103:06 - old HTML I stall for a minute yeah
103:09 - definitely
103:11 - Don Xavier says seen here me just says I
103:16 - hope it becomes funnier at some point -
103:21 - more fun yeah yeah definitely react took
103:31 - me a while to get used to as well so I
103:33 - think things don't start to get fun
103:36 - until you really get the hang of it III
103:39 - think a lot of things are like that not
103:41 - just with programming so it's probably
103:47 - not gonna seem that fun at first but
103:50 - once you're comfortable with it it does
103:52 - get more fun like I I've found it to be
103:54 - more fun like I went back and redid one
103:58 - of my projects for free code camp and
104:00 - react that I had originally done with
104:02 - jQuery and I thought it was just it was
104:06 - more fun to make with react the second
104:08 - time around than it was with jQuery so I
104:12 - mean little comparisons like that
104:14 - definitely make me realize that I enjoy
104:16 - using react but I didn't always it was
104:21 - really frustrating at first Sebastian
104:24 - says arrow function and no need to bind
104:26 - okay cool let me so I remember exactly
104:31 - what I was doing at that point so let me
104:33 - show you just so we all know what we're
104:37 - talking about so I copied this from the
104:41 - documentation the react documentation
104:44 - basically I just copied it because I was
104:46 - I was thinking well I'm gonna copy
104:47 - everything over so I make sure this
104:49 - works but when I was copying it I kind
104:53 - of thought there's got to be a better
104:55 - way to do this and
104:57 - in fact there is if you use arrow
104:59 - functions then you don't have to do this
105:04 - because that that takes care of it so
105:06 - you definitely need to change this up
105:10 - but just just know that this line here
105:15 - is definitely not necessary
105:26 - let's see Don Xavier says when you start
105:28 - using es6 and Redux with it it's a whole
105:31 - lot of fun yeah for sure when you get to
105:35 - hanging up some of the stuff in es6 it
105:37 - is fun like I mean this is kind of
105:40 - simple but like template literals
105:42 - template literals changed my life
105:44 - alright so and me it made things so much
105:48 - more simple
105:50 - you know I at one point I was doing it
105:53 - seemed like everything I was doing
105:55 - required me to make these long like
105:58 - strings concatenate all these things
106:01 - together and then template literals you
106:04 - know like I learned about him and it was
106:06 - just like wow is this just save me so
106:09 - much time
106:10 - and then like you've been able to use
106:13 - let and const like it took me a while to
106:15 - get the hang of when I should use let
106:17 - and Const and what they are good for but
106:21 - now like it makes a lot of sense and
106:25 - that's not it's not there's a lot of
106:27 - other things in es6 that come in handy
106:30 - like like arrow functions right I don't
106:32 - know react would be so much harder
106:34 - without arrow functions so anyway that's
106:38 - that's cool I haven't done a lot with
106:40 - Redux yet but I've seen some things at
106:43 - like some presentations at conferences
106:46 - and on YouTube about Redux and it looks
106:49 - really cool so I'm looking forward to
106:51 - learning more about it da bill says I
106:55 - only have a few packets of G fuel left
106:57 - need to order a tub of powder soon yeah
106:58 - definitely so I as you probably heard me
107:07 - say before I drink g fuel for my
107:08 - caffeine often when I'm streaming and
107:11 - Bill chatted out as well so that's
107:16 - pretty cool I need to see if I get like
107:18 - some sort of an affiliate code or
107:20 - something so like I can give it out to
107:22 - you guys and you can get like a certain
107:25 - percent off and then I get some money or
107:27 - something or at least some free G fuel I
107:32 - should do that actually I had an idea
107:35 - this morning the
107:37 - I should try to get like all of my
107:40 - referral codes and things that I have
107:42 - from various things and then just put
107:44 - them on a website somewhere so that you
107:47 - all can get discounts like you know I
107:49 - have those codes sometimes where it's
107:51 - like if someone uses your discount code
107:53 - they get like $10 off or like $10 and
107:57 - credit and you do - it would be cool to
108:00 - like have that and then that way if you
108:03 - are gonna use something anyway you might
108:05 - be able to get a discount and then as a
108:07 - bonus I might get something out of it -
108:11 - that might be cool and then you guys
108:14 - could see what products I use I guess I
108:16 - mean especially with with tech stuff you
108:19 - might be interested in that so maybe
108:21 - I'll do that at some point not really
108:24 - high on my priority list right now but
108:26 - that might be a cool thing it might save
108:28 - you also money and if I were to do that
108:33 - it would have just been it would be me
108:36 - officially free code camp would not be
108:38 - endorsing any of the stuff that I put on
108:39 - there so I don't want to imply that at
108:43 - all let's see Kevin says by the way the
108:48 - syntax for name inside the object
108:50 - literal is a new thing from es6 it's
108:52 - called computed property names
108:54 - all right cool yeah actually thanks for
108:55 - pointing that out so I totally skipped
108:58 - over that and just didn't say anything
108:59 - but this is really cool so if you let me
109:04 - let me go to in the documentation they
109:10 - have so they explain this so here we go
109:15 - so that part is es6 computed property
109:19 - name so if you want to learn more about
109:20 - it check out you know this page and the
109:22 - react documentation the page on forms
109:25 - but in es5 you have to write all of this
109:30 - right so you'd have to have a variable
109:33 - for partial state which would be an
109:37 - object and then partial state name would
109:41 - be given the value and then this set
109:43 - state partial state right so a lot of
109:46 - stuff can be boiled down to just this
109:50 - really cool
109:55 - and thanks for for bringing it up I feel
110:01 - like you all are like catching so many
110:03 - things that I'm either like saying wrong
110:05 - or didn't explain so thank you you guys
110:08 - are helping you you all are helping this
110:12 - stream be so much better especially
110:15 - today
110:20 - [Music]
110:22 - Rud Rud rang shoe not sure about the
110:26 - name sorry if I'm messing it up says
110:28 - anyone know any good tutorials for Redux
110:31 - I always get lost when I see Redux I
110:33 - don't really know like I said I don't
110:35 - really know Redux that well so I can't
110:37 - help you I think the learn code Academy
110:41 - YouTube channel has some videos on redux
110:44 - I like vaguely remember watching them a
110:46 - while ago they're pretty old so I'm not
110:51 - sure how much if Redux has changed a lot
110:54 - but I think some of the basic ideas
110:56 - behind it are still the same so they
110:57 - might be helpful as an introduction
110:59 - other than that I'm about to take the
111:02 - Udacity course on Redux so I'll be able
111:07 - to let you know if it's good in about a
111:09 - month or so Goggin asks just being
111:17 - curious if you tried Gatsby Jas I have
111:19 - not tried Gatsby yet but I've had some
111:21 - some people recommend it to me so I'd
111:25 - like to try at some point but haven't
111:28 - tried it yet bill says the docs for
111:33 - Redux have some good examples beyond
111:35 - that udemy and Udacity are great
111:37 - resources okay cool
111:42 - okay wearing shoe is asking for if
111:45 - there's free ones you get me paid yeah
111:46 - so
111:51 - yeah definitely infinitely free ones
111:54 - well I mean the YouTube thing that I was
111:56 - talking about would obviously not be
111:58 - paid the Udacity is definitely paid
112:01 - udemy as well
112:03 - bill says free code camp has some
112:05 - lessons - in beta or alpha right now
112:08 - can't recall yeah you could check out
112:09 - the beta free code camp curriculum and
112:13 - see what they have there it might be
112:15 - worth it you just skip ahead and do a
112:17 - couple of the the lessons in the beta
112:21 - curriculum the Philip says you are away
112:30 - nerdier than I thought
112:31 - what did I I don't know when was that
112:34 - that was like an hour ago he said that
112:36 - so I don't remember what I was talking
112:38 - about when I he said I was in their year
112:41 - so they let me know what I was talking
112:43 - about cuz I can't I don't disagree that
112:46 - I'm a nerdy person but I was just
112:49 - wondering what I said that was nerdy ok
112:58 - so west boss has a free Redux tutorial
113:03 - so Sarah Sarah says West's boss says
113:05 - free Redux tutorial awesome thank you
113:07 - for that
113:13 - egghead dot io / redux free tutorials as
113:17 - well cool I got some good resources here
113:21 - Scott Co has a resource this from from
113:25 - dawn Xavier and the great code adventure
113:30 - has one as well
113:33 - okay Joseph before I was using exact
113:39 - wrong with my link and Joseph says exact
113:43 - is used in nav like and route okay cool
113:46 - thanks for clarifying that for me Omar
113:51 - says fan from Egypt Jesse is this
113:54 - project has this project have a back-end
113:57 - part not right now it may end up having
114:01 - some somewhat of a back-end I haven't
114:04 - sided for sure yet I was actually
114:05 - checked I mean you can if you can read
114:07 - my tabs I was checking out MongoDB and
114:10 - CouchDB just to see if I wanted to try
114:13 - those out for this project it's not
114:15 - necessary but we are going to be
114:17 - collecting data and file uploads so I
114:21 - had considered maybe having some sort of
114:24 - a database to keep track of all that but
114:26 - it's not 100% necessary currently I'm
114:29 - keeping track of that by and in the live
114:34 - version of this that we're remaking the
114:36 - data gets sent out in emails it goes to
114:39 - a Google sheet and it goes to our
114:43 - project management system and that's all
114:46 - you know through api's but it's all done
114:50 - client-side which i don't want to do
114:52 - anymore so potentially I don't need
114:56 - another database since the data is
114:58 - already being stored but it does make me
115:00 - a bit nervous that I'm relying on like
115:04 - all this client-side API calls I'm just
115:10 - not a hundred percent like sure that
115:12 - that's the most reliable way to do
115:13 - things and I have had some instances
115:16 - where the the file uploads didn't go
115:18 - through so I know somebody try to upload
115:22 - a file because I got the file name but
115:24 - the actual file never went through so
115:27 - that worries me that it's like there's
115:29 - something slipping through the cracks
115:30 - and I don't know what the issue is yeah
115:36 - so anyway I'm thinking about it but I'm
115:39 - just not sure not sure exactly what I
115:43 - want to do about it I say it says do you
115:47 - think Linux or Mac is a better
115:49 - development environment for a web
115:50 - developer I I don't think I can answer
115:54 - that correctly because I so far I've
115:57 - only used Linux on servers
115:59 - I would like to use Linux I think my
116:03 - next laptop is probably gonna be Linux
116:05 - I'd really like to try it out I'm right
116:08 - now I develop almost yeah pretty much
116:11 - entirely on Mac I don't even remember
116:13 - the last time I used a PC to
116:16 - develop anything with but I I really
116:20 - like the experience that I have on a Mac
116:22 - for developing though like I said I I
116:25 - don't have anything to compare it to in
116:27 - terms of Linux all right Blake says or
116:34 - Windows versus Mac yeah honestly I I
116:38 - will have to say I've had a better
116:41 - experience developing on a Mac than I
116:43 - have on Windows and I developed
116:45 - exclusively on Windows for years before
116:48 - I switched to Mac and I didn't have a
116:51 - problem with it the only reason I
116:52 - switched is because the department I
116:54 - work in has all Macs so I thought ok
116:57 - I'll just use a Mac and instead of being
117:00 - the odd one out so I used the Mac and
117:04 - once after I got used to it I really
117:08 - really liked it I liked it enough that I
117:11 - ended up buying a macbook for myself
117:13 - because i've been using an imac at work
117:16 - so yeah I I prefer a Mac if we're
117:21 - talking Mac versus Windows I prefer Mac
117:23 - for development obviously though if
117:26 - we're talking about gaming I definitely
117:29 - go with Windows if if we're gonna do
117:32 - some gaming stuff but yeah so that's my
117:40 - opinion
117:40 - I know there's strong opinions either
117:43 - way on on that subject of operating
117:46 - system
118:10 - okay Patrick says did you use I'm trying
118:14 - to see like the empty quotes rather than
118:18 - and bsp for a reason I'm not sure where
118:23 - that was at I'm not okay I'm thinking
118:33 - I'm guessing you're talking about this
118:34 - here this gets added in automatically so
118:39 - I keep seeing these I'm assuming this is
118:41 - something that happens is when prettier
118:42 - runs on one commit so I I there's no
118:50 - reason why I'm putting these in cuz I'm
118:52 - not doing it it just is put in
118:54 - automatically so I'm not I'm not even
118:56 - sure why it doesn't really mess anything
118:58 - up that I've seen but I'm guessing
119:01 - that's what you were referring to
119:11 - brian says but yarn has neat icons when
119:15 - you run it until n PM has icons I'll
119:17 - stick with yarn and then a little
119:20 - winking emoji that's a that's legit
119:24 - reason that's the most compelling reason
119:26 - I've heard so far to use yarn I think so
119:30 - I'll go with that does it seem to me
119:34 - like yarn and NPM are so similar in what
119:37 - they do that I just I don't think it
119:42 - matters that much which one you use it's
119:47 - so I mean that the debate is good you
119:53 - know to try to figure out which one is
119:55 - the better thing to use but I don't
119:58 - think it really has impacted my
120:01 - development experience that much to use
120:04 - either yarn or NPM
120:26 - okay Rohan says you usually require
120:31 - extra tinkering to set up dev
120:33 - environment on Windows actually I I do
120:35 - that was true for me I don't know if
120:38 - it's different cuz I'm I set everything
120:40 - up on Windows 7 so maybe things are
120:42 - easier now I don't really know but at
120:44 - least on Windows 7 it's it did seem like
120:49 - it was more difficult to get everything
120:51 - running in terms of my dev environment
120:53 - but I will say that I was much less
120:56 - experienced when I did that so when I
120:58 - was setting everything up on a Mac I had
121:00 - already worked through everything on
121:02 - Windows twice before because I think I
121:07 - had my hard drive crash and I had to get
121:09 - a new one so I did it I didn't set it up
121:11 - twice so who knows maybe it was my
121:16 - inexperience that made it seem like it
121:18 - was more difficult but it definitely did
121:20 - seem like it just didn't run quite as
121:22 - smoothly Patrick says graph QL is the
121:27 - future yeah I agree
121:31 - Don Xavier says graph QL this is when we
121:35 - were I was talking a little while ago
121:36 - about someone had asked a question about
121:39 - whether or not they should learn graph
121:41 - graph QL if they were going to be a
121:43 - reactive so in regard to that
121:45 - Don Xavier says graph QL unless the
121:48 - client or boss asked for it otherwise
121:51 - simple REST API calls do the trick and
121:53 - more even if it becomes if until it
121:58 - becomes a standard when can I reuse rust
122:02 - api's ok not sure the end of that I was
122:06 - a little confused with but basically I
122:07 - think I get what you're saying is like
122:10 - REST API calls are fine now
122:13 - if graph QL does become a standard then
122:17 - you can always replace that though I
122:21 - kind of think that was it which I think
122:23 - that makes sense basically like I think
122:25 - at this point it's still safe to hold
122:29 - off on learning graph QL if you really
122:31 - aren't sure about it yet
122:33 - there's definitely be time to pick it up
122:35 - if in fact graph QL does really become
122:38 - the thing that replaces REST API
122:58 - Giordano says hey Jessie I have a
123:00 - question when the beta site will come
123:03 - online I'm assuming you're talking about
123:06 - the free code camp beta curriculum
123:08 - correct me if I'm wrong the answer I
123:12 - think officially is soon so check out I
123:18 - think Quincy has had like a forum post
123:21 - or blog post or something about it
123:23 - recently so but I think honestly it's
123:28 - like it's gonna come out when it's ready
123:29 - and we're not really sure when it will
123:30 - be ready I'm not actually working on it
123:32 - so I don't have you know any like inside
123:36 - knowledge about it or anything like that
123:38 - so officially I think there is no
123:41 - release date so I think they just don't
123:47 - want to release it until it's ready bill
123:52 - says I don't like right left scroll
123:53 - because I tend to accidentally swipe
123:55 - back and forth back and forward a page
123:59 - from a Mac yeah I do that patrick said
124:07 - refactor those into a map over the data
124:10 - like name phone email dot map okay cool
124:16 - off to see
124:22 - I have to check that out later on I'm
124:26 - gonna try wow the shames been going on
124:28 - for over two hours now so let me I'm
124:30 - gonna skip and just go to the questions
124:32 - in the live chat and just try to answer
124:35 - some of the questions especially if
124:38 - there's some from some new people
124:40 - [Music]
124:43 - okay Rohan asks how many people actually
124:45 - drop out after your end of coding
124:47 - announcement actually not a lot
124:52 - we're like it like 37 viewers now I
124:56 - think I think we'd better closer to 50
125:01 - teachers I didn't really pay attention
125:02 - this time the most we had in the stream
125:05 - was 60 at one time just for today's
125:10 - stream and so now we're you know we're
125:13 - down to 37 so I usually don't drop too
125:17 - many I would say like never more than
125:22 - like 25% of people drop out
125:48 - okay cool Patrick says you can set up a
125:52 - global get ignore so you don't
125:54 - accidentally add node modules okay
125:57 - that's that's really really good advice
125:59 - I need to do that you know what I knew
126:01 - that at some point and then totally
126:03 - forgot about it that's a great idea so
126:06 - I'm not the strees been going on a long
126:09 - time so I'm not going to try to
126:10 - demonstrate this or anything but you can
126:11 - set it up globally so that for any
126:14 - project you're doing it'll automatically
126:16 - ignore node modules so definitely
126:19 - recommend doing that because I can't
126:20 - think of any reason off the top of my
126:23 - head why you would want to include your
126:25 - node modules in your git repo
126:37 - John Hanson says is it best there he
126:40 - asks is it best to have your project all
126:41 - set up to go before building anything
126:45 - before using it I don't know I sometimes
126:51 - I start building out my project before I
126:53 - start using it because there's a lot of
126:55 - basic stuff that I don't really like I
126:58 - know how it's gonna go I don't really
126:59 - need to use get other times I start
127:01 - getting immediately before I do anything
127:03 - I'm not really sure what the best thing
127:05 - would be to do I suppose like if you
127:09 - were working on a team right off the bat
127:10 - then get get up and running but
127:13 - otherwise if it's just you then I don't
127:16 - really see a problem in holding off if
127:18 - you're just going to do some basic setup
127:20 - so not sure I'm you know other people
127:23 - might have some different insight into
127:25 - that into that issue but that's I mean
127:28 - that's what I do okay almost to the
127:35 - bottom of the live chat
127:57 - John Henson says I've got Jesse to blame
128:00 - for getting me started thinking react
128:02 - though I went the react.js route instead
128:05 - of create react app yeah it it's harder
128:11 - it's definitely harder to try to do
128:13 - react from scratch and setup webpack and
128:15 - everything I tried to do that at first
128:17 - as well and and failed so sometimes it's
128:23 - better just to use create react app or
128:25 - next or something like that just to get
128:28 - kind of get started and get comfortable
128:29 - with it and then this learn the other
128:31 - stuff later on if you need to Dixie says
128:39 - with all the mistakes I make it's
128:40 - comforting to see you and be like hey if
128:43 - Jesse can get through it so can i thanks
128:51 - once again I'm very glad to be be
128:55 - comforting to you Jack Bennett asks
129:01 - what's a good language to learn first
129:03 - I'm just starting out it really depends
129:08 - on what you want to do if you want to
129:09 - get into web development then I
129:12 - definitely recommend JavaScript I really
129:14 - I can't really see any reason why or any
129:17 - good argument why a web developer would
129:21 - not want to learn JavaScript because you
129:24 - definitely need it if you're not so much
129:26 - interested in web development then you
129:30 - can pick it you know depending on what
129:32 - you want to do you can pick different
129:33 - things so if if you want to make I Oh s
129:36 - apps
129:37 - I think Swift is what they develop that
129:39 - in for Android is Java and now Kotlin if
129:45 - you just want to learn and you're not
129:46 - don't really sure what you want to do
129:48 - Python seems to be a pretty easy one for
129:51 - beginners
129:54 - [Music]
129:56 - yeah I think those are the ones people
130:00 - usually talk about for beginners I mean
130:04 - there's some other ones I know that get
130:06 - used in like beginning computer science
130:08 - courses but I don't know like like
130:13 - Harvard's computer science intro course
130:15 - uses I think it starts with C so not not
130:23 - really sure like if you're trying to
130:25 - teach yourself I'm not sure that's the
130:26 - best place to start
130:33 - bill says in regard to that you can take
130:36 - the concepts to any language so oh I'm
130:40 - sorry I was reading a second comment he
130:42 - said JavaScript with web development all
130:45 - right cool
130:47 - definitely agree with that but you can
130:49 - take the concepts to any language it's
130:51 - just syntax yeah that is true like if
130:53 - you learn one language that the concepts
130:55 - the core concepts can translate well
130:58 - into other languages so it would be
131:00 - easier to pick up another computer
131:02 - language like a programming language
131:04 - once you learn the first one so don't
131:06 - worry too much about what you're going
131:08 - to start out with isaiah's asks what are
131:14 - some good ideas for personal projects in
131:15 - reacts react and redux
131:23 - I don't know if you check out free code
131:28 - camp in some of their challenges I think
131:34 - those are good ideas like it if you're
131:37 - trying to find like a really unique idea
131:38 - to build something that nobody's built
131:40 - I'm not really sure I would say like ask
131:42 - ask friends and family and maybe they'll
131:44 - have some idea otherwise if you're just
131:46 - looking for ideas in general then check
131:50 - out the free code can't challenges and
131:51 - there's a lot of ideas for what to build
131:54 - with user stories and things that will
131:56 - give you some direction assuming you
131:59 - haven't done them already
132:04 - also there's great ok cool so in the
132:08 - live chat there's some some links to
132:13 - some medium article about things you can
132:18 - build ok cool so yeah there are places
132:23 - on the internet that have lists of just
132:26 - ideas for things to build so check that
132:28 - out it looks like the free code can't
132:30 - medium publication has has a post on
132:35 - that so kind of browse browse that and
132:39 - see
132:50 - Blake asks what framework should I use
132:52 - for html5 mobile apps and then Bill says
132:56 - have you thought of trying react native
132:57 - that would be my recommendation as well
133:00 - try out react native have I have not
133:03 - used it yet so I can't say for sure but
133:06 - I've I've heard a lot of good things
133:07 - about it
133:39 - alright I'm just scrolling through the
133:40 - last little bit here trying to see if
133:42 - there's any more questions and I am
133:48 - reading the comments too so if you've
133:49 - come in and I haven't missed that but
133:51 - I'm just kind of I'm not gonna read it
133:53 - out loud just because the video has been
133:55 - really long at this point
134:22 - okay cool I got through everything all
134:26 - right bill says he's gotta run see you
134:28 - later bill all right so I think I've
134:32 - gotten through all the questions really
134:33 - sorry if I missed something
134:35 - asked me again sometime and I'll do my
134:38 - best to answer thank you so much for for
134:41 - watching and for being in the live chat
134:44 - and contributing and for helping me out
134:46 - a lot thanks to Kevin and Sebastian for
134:50 - the pool requests they were awesome and

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jessie and today we're gonna do some stuff with forms and react so if if any of you have built something with react where you needed to handle form data especially if you had to handle file uploads let me know what you like to use if you know if there's some some package or something that makes it easy that you think is awesome let me know and I'll check it out and I might use it otherwise I think I'll just start out by making some controlled components some controlled inputs and and we'll just go from there and see how much we can get done I have on the screen the URL for our server our end rocks server so you can check out everything that we're doing you know live and I'm gonna paste that into the live chat all right I see some people were saying hi in the live chat hey everyone hey thanks for watching okay and as usual we have the the secondary stream going on on on Instagram as well the links in the description so while we're waiting wait for everybody to join let me just briefly thank those of you who submitted pull requests so we had four or three three three for us yeah we had three pull requests since yesterday stream so thank you to Kevin and Sebastian for the pull request I merge these in this one eye closed just because Sebastian had already done the same thing in this pull request but this one this pull request had some other stuff that I wanted to merge so since I was gonna merge this anyway I just closed this one otherwise there would have been merged conflicts because the same lines were being changed in the files so but we have basically some additional testing and then now if you do clone the the repo and you try to commit something the tests will run on commit so it'll be a little little extra in your in your console you'll see that the test run and when we can I'm assuming that at some point during today's stream will commit something so you'll be able to see what that looks like in the terminal so that was awesome thanks Kevin and Sebastian did it he did a few things so he moved move the components into the proper folder a little bit of organization and made sure that it when we're where we were using that component the the path changed to reflect the new location and then also we have this you could you could see it if you're checking out the N drop link but I'll bring it over I kept on my other screen yeah let me bring this over so the upload button so we we ended the string yesterday talking about this file upload so what Sebastian did was took all these styles and some of the JavaScript for the file upload actually it converted the JavaScript that was being used by materialized framework into something that was better with react you know the more of the react way of doing things and got the file upload working so it looks good it looks almost exactly like what I had before which I'll I'll bring that on the screen to to compare I gotta open it again this it always loves me out of the system that this is in I always have to log back in but with the exception of the color and possibly the size you can see it looks pretty much exactly the same the only thing that I guess we don't have is this this text which i think is not necessary maybe the only reason I put that there was just to let people know that they could upload more than one file but that's implied by the use of the plural files here as well so I'm not even sure I'm gonna put that in here so thank thank you for that Sebastian and Kevin and you can see I've added in the the proper labels for a lot of these and down here actually this was way more tricky than I thought it would be so the default for checkbox is the material UI is that you can click anywhere on the label and it'll either select that checkbox or unselected so I tried to put a link in here and I did put the link in so you can I was able to pass in an element and I just wrapped this in a span and then put the link in but I couldn't click it every time I tried to click the link it actually you know made the checkbox become selected and unselected so this it's a little bit odd so the solution after I shot a few things the best solution was there was basically a div that was enclosing all of this and I just the div like I think 35 pixels wide so now the div stops you can see where it stops like right here so then that allows this link to work so a little bit of an odd thing but just thought I'd bring that up and in case in case anyone wondered if you looked at the code and saw the weird stuff I was going with this that's why I did it like that all right so we have the form and I mean with the exception of you know some minor minor things of you know the padding and things like that the names for these this is pretty much what the form is going to be also changed this a bit but what I want to do is have this form actually do something because right now nothing happens you can hit the submit button and nothing happens so we need we need to do something so let me let me explain what how I envisioned this working and then you all can let me know whether or not that's a good idea or if you have a better idea so what will happen basically is all these will be controlled let me bring up just so you all know in case you're not familiar with the idea of controlled input where did I have it I always have too many windows open to have it here oh I had it up here the whole time okay so controlled components if you go to just the the react Doc's Facebook github io / react slash Docs and you go to the forms page it talks about this so you can read up more on it but basically what we're gonna do is every time one of these changes so the value changes it's going to update the state for that component and then the value we get the value for that component from state so what ends up happening is that we don't change the value directly I mean sitting from a user's perspective it works the same way but what's happening behind the scenes is that we don't change the value directly when you we type in here the on change fires and then it changes the state and then since the state has changed it causes the render the rerender and then the value you get the value from state so everything kind of flows I guess differently normally it's just like directly changing the value when you type in there now why would we want to do it like that well one nice thing is it makes it easy to do validation so I don't know that I absolutely need a lot of validation for this but it leaves us open to that if we do it like this right away also all of our values then are going to be in the state and it's going to be really easy to pull those values and do whatever we need to with them so we're gonna do that we're gonna grab the at some point when the user click Submit we're gonna need to get all those values and what's probably gonna happen is they're gonna get sent to our server j/s which we may have to eject or create react app so as you know we used create react app to do this and if you notice we don't have a server ojs file here so we're probably going to need to eject it unless anyone else has a better idea we're going to need to eject that and then we're going to in our form data there and then handle everything there serverside that way you know we don't have to worry about exposing any API keys on the clientside which currently I am actually doing to make this work where it is now and the only reason I was comfortable doing that is because it was behind a password so no one could even see this page unless they were able to log in and only employees of the University could log in so I was I was ok with that because probably 99% of the employees would have no idea even how to find the key and if they found it they would wouldn't know what it did for any of the api's that we're gonna be using so now that it's not gonna be beyond the password definitely don't want to handle that stuff clientside so I want to do everything serverside and that's the plan so having said all that what do you think let me know in the live chat if you're watching this later on let me know in the comments if you're watching it way later on then I guess don't worry about because this project will probably already be completed but if you do have an opinion you can still let me know I'll read it later on it just won't get into this project maybe a future project so hey to everyone joining me in an Instagram I think okay it looks like I recognized the names in the Instagram so you all know what's going on I don't have to tell you where to see the code at all right so let me check the live chat since I said a lot of stuff and I want to hear what you all think all right so Don Xavier says four forms you can go with form Z react has some validation and other goodies and if you want material you I check out form Z material you I okay cool I'm gonna check that out let me bring that up on my other screen here I like that they already have something with mature UI all right some checking out the github page now let me bring this over so we had a suggestion you use form Z the form Z mature UI okay it seems pretty straightforward it's not not a whole lot in the readme if you see something to get home that has a short read me it's either really simple or there's there's just not a lot of directions they come with it so it could be really good or not really good but this looks pretty straightforward maybe we use that let me uh let me see what else what else you all think okay Sebastian Sebastian added something that should be showing up okay so let file value equals the state file input okay so basically Sebastian is saying here this is our service request form component that what should happen the file value should say select a file to upload if there's nothing in state four where's the file input so yeah I'm not really sure why that's not working let me refresh it was do that you refresh the page and see that's all I'm gonna check what the state is in dev tools it opened on the other screen there but okay that's odd maybe so it's showing an empty array for actually notes yeah for file input it's showing an empty array maybe I don't know maybe since it actually exists even though it's an empty array it's it's not triggering the the war side of that but that's cool since that's in there I can make that work and then that'll just be an easy way to have that text show up so thanks thanks for pointing that out Sebastian ok Roland says shouldn't the planning guy to open in a new tab that is a good idea so if you notice when I click planning guide it didn't open a new tab but you would except in a new tab especially actually I want to see if I type stuff in I want to see if it saves if I were to hit back no it actually cleared it out yes a good call on that definitely want this to open in a new tab otherwise it would be super frustrating for someone to fill all this out get to the bottom say I'd like to read the planning guide first and then have it all taken away so I think on the current version it doesn't take it away so it doesn't clear the fields so we'll have to see I was trying to think of a way where I could make it make everything stay there I mean the really the simplest solution is to make this open in a new tab so I will do that let me add that so I finally get the Trello board going a little bit so I can I'll send a link to this I'll share it and then put a link in the video if hopefully I'll remember later on to do it and then you all can check out this Trello board as as I'm working with it adding to it and that should not take very long so I'm going to put that down for a half of a pomodoro cycle all right so good stuff you all have great ideas for me already it's just at the beginning of the stream Andrew says hi Jesse just wanted to thank you so much for sharing your work as a beginner learning react this has been so helpful to me oh well thanks for saying that I'm glad that this is helpful to you and I really appreciate you saying that and then whenever anybody has some positive feedback for me I appreciate that I don't mind critical feedback either so occasionally I get feedback that's not so positive but there's always something that that can be helpful even in a negative feedback unless it's just completely crazy and somebody's really angry but usually there's something something helpful but the positive stuff keeps me going and it makes me really look forward to these dreams and I'm really happy that that I'm helping some of you out I know you all are helping me out I've learned so much from from you since I've started streaming I think this has been the fastest I've ever learned maybe since I've heard you know when you first start you fly through HTML and CSS and think you're awesome like and then you hit JavaScript and they're like can't do anything once you starts to do difficult things so aside from that first early time of rapid rapid learning this has been like amazing because when you all submit code to me I have to try to figure it out I don't want to just pull it in without understanding it so I've been learning quite a lot oh cool rollin said the the Instagram stream is synced with this one that's really cool I'm glad I never thought about it until now but I guess it would be really hard to watch if they were out of sync it would it would be weird so that's cool that it's it's all synced up okay bill said that he used formzee material you I and a react project recently and liked how easy it was to use awesome definitely think I might end up using that okay Sebastian said if I set the initial state to null then this text should show up so am i setting yeah here it is I'm setting state there all right let's check check that out yeah that works okay cool so yeah I'll probably end up changing the color which I was gonna change the color these anyway all of them so I'll just do it when I do that but cool so now the text does appear there and awesome cool thanks for that Sebastian sebastian what's up with the frowny face emoji did I say something that made you said I remember what I was saying Philips hit the Instagram people will be like question mark question mark yeah I've had people pop in on Instagram during the stream before and just type like WTF and then leave they wonder why I'm just here because all you see on the instagrams stream is just me talking not even looking at the stream most of the time I'm looking at my screen and just talking with headphones on so uh I imagine it is kind of weird all right cool aim highs in here and suicide hey how's it going how's the new job yeah let me know I haven't haven't heard from you in a while and also sometimes I call you by whatever your name is on on YouTube but I mean I know what your real names are a lot of times either from github or Twitter or something so if you have a preference if for some reason you don't want me to use your real name on my stream let me know because otherwise I'll probably end up doing it at some point it just reminded me because I always say aim high because that's his name in chat but I do know his real name from Twitter so so let me know if it doesn't matter to you that's cool and I'll just use whichever name and otherwise I don't want to I don't know if somebody's like in the witness protection program or something I don't want to mess things up for you so so let me know if you don't want me to say your name on the stream oh okay John had a good idea the planning guide could be a modal hmm alright I'm gonna think about that if the planning guy pops up as a modal then I don't have to worry about about anything happening to their their data in the form I'm yeah I'm gonna think about that I kind of like that idea especially since I'm gonna condense the planning guide a bit before the Planning guide was spread out over several pages so a modal wouldn't make quite as much sense it would be a lot of information for the modal but we'll see yeah that might that might work Hamza says the link here is is only bolded would it be hard for the user to distinguish between the basically to make to know that that is a link yeah it's possible that it could be difficult I could maybe make it a different color that would be more usually what I would I have done on other sites is the links not just bolded it's actually a completely different color whatever the the main accent color is that I'm using so maybe that would be better to go with a different color I really don't want to put in the the underline the standard default underlined under a link I just don't like how that looks to me if the underlined under the link just looks really really oldschool like the early internet and so I don't I don't like it although I I understand that people would immediately see like hey that's a link but if I if I don't if I can get away with not having that and people still understanding it's a link I'd rather do it like that but I do understand what you're saying okay so Kevin says I think you can get away without ejecting by just creating a server das file and changing the NPM start to do NPM run build and then nodes serve Jaso okay cool that's good to know I'd rather not eject if I don't have to so I will I will try that I'm actually I'm gonna copy what you just put in the live chat and paste it somewhere because in case the chat gets really long and that message gets deleted I want to have it so I'm gonna put it right in there cash cash yep says I'm lacking motivation to code I want to but I end up not doing it yeah that's tough I know I've been there I guess trying to think what I do to get motivated it's easier to get motivated now than before I guess when I was freelance because now like I have a boss that could potentially say like what are you doing get to work so that that helps I found when I like motivation usually I'm getting depressed so I need like exercise possibly caffeine but does anyone else have any good ideas for getting motivated you know go ahead and put them in the live chat if if you do okay Sebastian I finally understand why why Sebastian put the the frown emoji in the chat so I had missed the first time that he said gave the solution to to what was going on here so sorry you know sometimes it takes me about to see things in the chat so the chat is is very active right now so I'm gonna have to pull away from it and do some coding here in a minute because we're already a half hour in and I've done very little all right so let me let me do some coding I'll do my I'll set my timer so I'll come back to the live chat whenever my Pomodoro timer is up or if I need your help I'll come back to the live chat you know before it's up which the likelihood of me needing help is really high as as you all know but for now so don't worry if I didn't get you your comment or question and the lab chat I will get to it eventually let's see so actually you know what I want to try first just to see cuz this is this is going to be a big deal I'd like to try this because I'm really curious as to how I would do the custom server stuff yeah yeah let me see where's my package.json file so in case you're you're not familiar with what's going on here maybe if you're just joining or you're not familiar with react so we created this using create react app and that took care of a lot of the setup that goes into like setting up web pack and hot module reloading and a lot of stuff that can be a headache to set up at the beginning the project and you don't really need to know how to do all that if you just want to get started and do something basic with react but if you want to start doing custom things you can't do it by default with create react app because a lot of that stuff is kind of hidden away and that's what makes it so easy to get started with and use but it also makes it difficult to customize so they built in a feature called eject which lets you basically see all that customization stuff once you eject though you can't go back so I'd rather not eject if I don't have to if I'm not a ejected yet I can still update and take advantage of whatever new stuff is coming so it's it's definitely a tradeoff I've done it I've done projects where I never ejected and I've also done stuff where I have ejected so I guess it just really depends on what you what you need to do so right now I know that at some point I'm gonna want to do things in my server ojs file I was thinking that I might have to eject but I might maybe I won't have to eject so let's see I wonder I just had a thought could I make a branch in eject the branch and then just see what what happens just see how bad that is and then still have my master branch be not ejected right that could work right let's uh I kind of want to do it now that I've talked about it yeah let's do that actually I really want to show you all what its if you've never done it before seen it like so that you don't have to try to eject one of your own projects and you know potentially mess it up if you don't want to so let's do it on this because I haven't done a project that I've ejected for a long time so yeah let's try it and see what happens what do you think but Sebastian Sebastian recommended just make a copy of the folder the project is in so you don't mess up your get would that mess it up I mean could I would it mess it up that bad that I should completely have a different directory for my project because otherwise I kind of like okay yes it seems like a few people yeah that's what I was thinking Kevin says that worst case you could just delete the node modules and do an NPM install again yeah that's what I was thinking right I can that should work right although now that you all said that maybe it does make a lot of sense that I should that I should do this in a different directory so let me do that where's my where's my terminal that so if you join late and didn't see the link here's the link let me put that I pasted it in really early on like within the first minute so I'm gonna paste it in again just in case cuz you see there's not really a lot of connections open okay so let me go and she's gonna go to all right so I'm gonna pull the project into this folder and then eject it in there and then that way there's no chance that I will mess up what we're actually working on so this would be a good demo of how to pull down projects from get up as well so this might be a good day for beginners a little bit different than what I thought we were gonna do I just noticed today that github is like the first thing on my screen when I open a new tab and I was proud of that like I go to get up more frequently than anything else I was afraid it would be like Netflix or something and then but notice github so I've been working a lot let's see maybe I not CIA Resource Center okay so if you want to clone a repo which I'm sure you've heard me say that before so you go to github and then go to the repo that you want in this case this is what we want and we go to this clone or download button and copy now this depends on how you have it set up if you have your github account set up on your machine with SSH keys you can use this otherwise you can use HTTPS and I think that will prompt you to type in your github password so otherwise with SSH you don't need the password so but either one will work so I've copied that and I'm gonna now I'm in the directory that I want to be in for this and I'm gonna type git clone and I'm going to put that in now let's go Resource Center there you go so here's our files now once you've done that you want to either type in NPM install or Yarn depending on what you want to use if you have yarn and the file has a yarn lock then you probably just want to use yarn but that's entirely up to you so what you would you like to use for that and that's going to take all the stuff in package.json and it's going to install that so otherwise if you try to run this right now it may not work because you don't have actually there's no way it will work I'm pretty sure you have none of the node modules right now generally you don't want to sync your node modules to your github repo that's just kind of a waste since you have your package JSON everybody that downloads it knows what it they need so there's no reason to track your your node module folder okay so now let's type in your and I should have done this immediately so it was working while I was talking so now we're gonna type yourn I just realized that this is really tiny sorry about that and you make it bigger okay so yarn is now getting all the packages and dependencies that it needs and installing them so when yarn is finished we'll have everything we need to run this now what we're gonna do as soon as this finishes it's actually run eject and then we can compare since we'll have both versions open we can compare the file structure just to get an idea of what's different update yarn I get this message a lot I think sometimes either yarn gets updated a lot or I'm doing it wrong okay I'm gonna open this up in Adam and we see the package.json that we have here which is the same as the one we have on screen so pretty much the same or exactly the same here we go it's exactly the same so when I run it Jack then we can compare and see the differences so let me go back here and I'll run is it just eject yeah so using yarn or NPM or whatever you want I think you can just yarn eject I don't think you have to yarn run eject let's see if this works yep are you sure you want to eject its permanent yes I'm sure ejected successfully that was so fast okay so all this stuff should now be in our our package.json so let's check it out yep all right so now look at all this stuff so we couldn't see a lot of this before and now we can this was all still there behind the scenes it was just kind of hidden to make things a bit more simple okay so now we we actually have you know we have access to all of this what else do we have we have a scripts folder and this has some additional files some additional JavaScript files and we have a config folder so we got a lot of extra stuff we have our webpack configs which like there's a lot of stuff I mean there's a lot of stuff coming it out but there's there's still a lot of stuff in there so you can see it saves you a lot of time and effort configuring configuring all of this but that's what happens when you eject so there we go I'm now that I have ejected now I'm kind of like thinking I definitely don't want to eject if I don't have to because now I remember how crazy it gets when you eject and that all of a sudden there's all this stuff okay so definitely not going to commit that that change so for demonstration purposes we have ejected and now I actually have a another place where I could potentially just switch over and test what's going on you know see how how hard it would be to do it with it ejected so I guess it's beneficial to have that right now not hopefully I won't need to use it though and you can see why it just gets a lot more complex when you have all that they're just my package.json file alone got really big so it looks like how much time okay I'm being on time I'm not I see a lot happening in the live chat and I will check back on that just seen a few of the the comments here I see Patrick says ya know eject yeah you can see it's crazy when you eject it's definitely I'm I'm not I'm not at all an expert at web pack so you know all this kind of stuff I have not really sure what's going on okay so now now I think it's it's obvious to me I think I needed to see that just to know like how worth it is it for me to try to make this work without ejecting and now that I've seen all the extra stuff that happens when you eject like I said I've seen it before but it's been a really long time so I had forgotten but now that I've seen it I'm a little bit more motivated to try to make things work without having to eject so that was useful at least for me hopefully it was useful for you all to to see what what happens when you eject that so let's let's go in now and actually start working with our form okay so here's a question do I once do I want to make these controlled components if I'm gonna use a UI what was that the material UI camera what the name was form Z that was that I think it was form Z this one yeah form Z material you I would this then take care of some of that would I would I end up messing this up if I try to or just from what I'm seeing right here I guess not all right so I do want to kind of test this and read up on it so I'm not going to run this right now so I'm gonna move that off to the side I just don't want to spend a lot of time reading documentation while I'm livestreaming because that's not probably not really beneficial to anyone to stare at my screen while I read something all right so let's let's go where I lost my there it is okay so for our controlled components basically when it end up doing something like this so this is the section on handling multiple inputs which obviously is what we're doing we have a lot of inputs on that page so the way that they're doing it here in the documentation is their adding in in the state the name okay so they're taking the name of the input and then they're using that as the key and then obviously the value of the input is the value and then on their handle they have a handle input change event you can see basically it's kind of nice so they only have to say you know set state once everything else they just make it a Const and then they're able to grab what they need from that event so they can grab the value so you can see they even have you know check box which is great cuz we're gonna have a lot of check boxes so that's cool so I don't really have one I have to make a cost for every single one so hopefully there's a better way to do that because that would be a lot but that's better than having to have a totally different you know called a set state going on so I guess what I need to do is give a name to these inputs because I don't think they have names they don't have IDs or anything so we need to do that before we do anything else because we have no way to identify them so let me see I'm assuming that material UI just passes down the same thing yeah name okay we can just use name like Norma so just give it to a few of these okay so I'm just gonna do a couple just to make sure that this is working and then in our props I guess we'll have we don't really want any of these to have a beginning value right yeah cuz we're using our floating label basically so we don't we don't need a value to begin with so since that'll be a string I guess we'll start out with string what was the next one email okay subscribe this oops let me grab this as well sure you get that first we get semicolons so I'm not gonna manually get rid of the semicolons they'll be you gotten rid of when we commit okay so I think we have we need the on change and other than that I think we have everything let me change okay I misread this completely so I was very mistaken a few minutes ago so let me correct and I'm sure you've already corrected me in a live chat so I misread this so I apologize I was reading over this hastily before the stream was about to start so and I misread this somehow thinking that I would have to make a Const for each one which I thought seemed a bit ridiculous and in fact it was ridiculous because that's not even what they were doing so it looks like I won't have to do that so what's happening with these cost is so this is the target I don't know what I was thinking now it seems so obvious to me I guess that happens sometimes I didn't have any caffeine until just right when I started this dream so I'm gonna blame it on that I've got my G fuel no so now my brain is working okay so we're grabbing the event okay we're getting the target and we're saving that to a variable now we're using that to get the value so we can set that if it equals checkbox right then we're gonna get target checked otherwise else right we're gonna get target value okay and that's because for for the other inputs we can just grab the value and that'll give us the value of the input but for checkboxes it's different so we just there's we don't check the value of it we just want to know whether it's checked or not all right and that's gonna be a boolean so this makes a lot more sense now then we want to get the name and that's what we're using here so we're gonna get the name and the that makes so much sense sorry sorry for being such an idiot a few minutes ago so I'm sure those of you who know what you're doing with with you know with react knew immediately that I didn't know what I was talking about but I really apologize to those of you who are new I probably confuse you quite a bit I myself was confused so sorry about that so it seems like now we actually do have everything we'll need so let's just try it out and see see if we're actually gonna be able to change the state so I'm just gonna type in some nonsense here and then we're gonna check the state let me inspect this and then I'll bring over dev tools assuming it worked I'll bring it over and be impressive if it didn't work I'll just won't even show it but it did work okay so let me make it bigger okay so you can see here's the state for a component our service request component here's our state we have email we have and this is our the nonsense that I just typed in for all of them okay but we have email name phone number and that's exactly what need so we have all these values and let me see if I can let's do this in real time so you can see a change you can see the flash of kind of a green color under name as it changes so very cool so realtime you know on change it updates state awesome now I just realized that we in fact did not add the value like I said we are going to do so let me do that really quick value equals okay I should probably check the documentation to make sure I did that right but I'm pretty sure that's how it was let's make sure that still works okay cool now if I want to go I wonder if it will let me change the state right here in dev tools it'll be really cool if it does there we go okay let me see if I can change it cool all right so you say I change state here in dev tools and then it changed it here so we can see since I didn't set the value on this looks like the phone element it shouldn't change okay see so it doesn't change so that's what I was trying to explain at the beginning of the stream kind of the flow that it was gonna take was the value is gonna be set by the state and the state is set by what you type in here so hopefully that demonstrated that now my timer did go off a minute ago so I'm gonna go back to the live chat and all right and the it's been an hour of stream because my Instagram live stream just stopped because there's an hour limit so Wow I had 11 viewers so that's pretty good I mean not nowhere near what we get for the for the YouTube stream but I mean that says as I expected but that's cool I mean I I just kind of want to give people the opportunity to see what I look like in case they're interested sometimes we sometimes that's nice instead of just hearing someone's voice to be able to put a face with it and I don't know about you but it's always really hard for me to read like what somebody is is feeling if I can't see their face like are they being are they serious or they joking or happy like it's hard to tell so if you've if you can see their face it's kind of easier so I'll tell you I I'm actually smiling a lot when I do this dream so I really like doing this so that's normally my expression all right so I'm scrolling up in the live chat it looks like I can still read the stuff at the top so that's good so I won't miss anyone's anyone's questions or comments I just saw well earlier when I was saying I won't say your name on onair if you don't want me to and I've mentioned the witness protection program role and so that escalated quickly witness protection it did I mean I was I was just trying to think of some reason why someone wouldn't want me to say the real name that's the first thing that came to mind okay Sebastian says I need to remove exact in the link and check console so I guess I'm getting an error I have dev tools up now so let's check that out okay I'm gonna prop exact on the a tag this drop from the other man link okay never remove that I will remove that right now so don't forget yeah honor when I was doing this I couldn't I remembered that I had to put exact in somewhere when I was using reactor outer but I couldn't remember exactly where or how to put it in and I didn't bother looking it up and I put it in and at work so I just left it at that and I didn't even check the console so thanks for that Sebastian okay cool so Tiffany said when we were talking about the link and making sure that people knew that that really was a link so this this year this planning guide link which is this so Tiffany said a different color different color text triggers hey that's the link to so okay cool I agree thanks for the feedback okay it looks like Rohan agrees as well maybe use some other highlight color for the link okay cool oh man brah brian says yarn or NPM and why I'm knowledge I wonder wonder if any like a huge debate got started let me see it doesn't look like it oh man I was I was afraid there's gonna be this giant debate about your honor NPM it looks like there wasn't occasionally that's happened about code editors somebody mentions a code editor and then the live chat is just filled with people talking about their favorite editor or usually it's not even their favorite editor it's whatever editor they don't like and they talk about why it's bad so I actually like an answer to Brian's question I like yarn but I've heard that the newest version of NPM has some of the features that yarn has and it's also fast so I liked yarn because it has the yarn lock file and because it was faster than NPM but if that's not true anymore an NPM actually has a similar file and it's just as fast or faster then it probably makes more sense to just use NPM since you get you'd have it anyway instead of installing yarn in addition to that so maybe I'll I'll have to check out the newest version of NPM and see what I think about it and then I might actually switch away from yarn but for now I'm gonna stick with yarn until I get the time to check it out check out MTM again the newest version okay so we had a question earlier about you know how to stay motivated to code when you don't feel like coding umberto says I watch people create things or tutorial videos about stuff I'm interested in to get motivated so that's that's cool I don't even think about that it's a good idea I guess that would be motivating like just to remind remind yourself of the cool things that you can do yeah that is cool it is really amazing like coding is about you just get to create things like Withers there's nothing there and you just you start typing code and all things happen that's really cool and then you can you can just mess with it and start over completely and it doesn't matter if you break it does you it's just really cool there's not really a lot that you could do that's like that you could compare that to just the flexibility of it I say I said I listen to Johnny Cash to get motivated oh cool Don Xavier says motivated nothing like some nice tunes got to work with tunes and coffee okay cool yo so says he should get engaged with his peers okay yeah that's I do I agree with the music thing and the coffee thing as well but then also Joseph's comment about getting engaged with peers that can be really good I'm I I would I guess I don't have a lot of experience with having peers that also code because I mostly code by myself it's and I'm not like working with other people in project until now that I'm working with all of you so that actually is motivation for me that I know I'm gonna do the stream and so I wanna I want to get better and know more what I'm doing so I could be more helpful to you all but I know like when I I don't I don't often work out as much as I should nowadays but when I was younger I used to work out all the time and if you have a partner or some people that you work out with you're way less likely to skip a workout and I imagine it's probably the same thing if you have other people that you code with and you talk about coding with you're way less likely to stop coding because they will encourage you and call you out if you don't and you'll have like positive motivation to want to have new things to talk about when you see them so that's definitely a good idea let's see Hamza says why don't you use template strings man they're so better actually I'm not sure I can't remember what I was doing when that comment came up so Hamza I'm sorry I'm not sure what you're referring to with the template strings thing so normally I do use template strings or template literal syntax I use that almost all the time unless it's something really simple and then I just use sometimes I'll just use normal like string concatenation Tiffany says listen to upbeat music while you work suggestion to Door Cinema Club okay never heard that I'll have to check it out Phillip says try the Neo method electronic actually I I listened I listened to a lot of different music when I code so depending on the day I could be listening to anything it's the only music that I probably never listen to is country music so don't like country music but pretty much anything else I like but I K I do listen to electronic music today I listen to a lot of lecture music I don't know about anyone here but if I really want to get motivated I listen to music from the Rocky movies so I don't if you've ever seen any of the Rocky movies a lot of them came out I think they started coming out in the seventies some came out in the 80s and then they started making new ones within the last 10 years or so but the soundtracks always get me fired up I remember watching those movies when I was a kid and getting so pumped up so uhhuh so that that helps me maybe if there's some something like that that you have like strong emotions with when you hear it that could probably help you out alright Isaiah says how important is it to know graph QL for a react developer I don't know graph QL and the take the truth I never considered myself a react developer but maybe I should think about it because I'm building sites for my job and for clients on the side with react so I'm not really sure how you define react developer but I develop sites with react so maybe I am I don't I don't know but anyway that's not really the question honestly I do think graph QL is really cool from what I've read about it I do want to learn it and I think that it's going to be used more so like if I had to guess I would say a graph QL is going to be the thing that people use it seems like it makes a lot more sense I mean I like REST API as I love working with REST API so they're really easy to work with but a graph QL does seem like it makes more sense than the REST API is just in terms of like you can get exactly the data you want and less trips so it seems like there would be less waste in terms of getting data that you really don't need and making a lot of extra trips whereas with graph QL you could probably get exactly the data you need in one trip so I think graph QL is important is it necessary to know definitely not it's important I don't know I think it's pretty important I think right now you definitely don't need to know it but I think it's going to be more used more more and more as you come or more people adopt it and I don't know that's just my my guess but I mean who knows what's gonna happen something else better could come out in a week and then we'll forget about graph QL but I would I would say if you have the time to learn it and you want to learn it then go for it Rowen says by the way the upload file list is not scrollable might get people confuse okay cool I'm gonna move this over the other screen just in case I have like some topsecret files actually I just I don't have anything crazy but I do have files that are like the names of people who have applied to for the web developer job so I don't want to put their names on YouTube so I'm gonna open this on my other screen just in case okay I'm cool I just have I'll bring this back I just have my thumbnails for all my videos here so let's open this let me open a bunch of them and see what's going on here okay so you're saying it's not scrollable for this list okay yeah people might get confused I'm not I don't really know offhand how I would make this scrollable onna maybe I could do something with CSS with the overflow yeah maybe I could do something with the overflow property so I will add that to the list and I'm gonna give that a one Pomodoro cycle because in case my first idea doesn't work it might take a little bit longer alright cool thanks for that Rohan I'm actually really glad I finally like kind of set this up because it is a lot easier for me to just put something in here instead of forgetting about it okay let me see man I just look there's a lot of stuff going on the live chat I want to make sure I get to all of it but probably be a good idea to do a bit more with this let me think what I need actually you know what I'm kind of thinking there's not really anything that everything that I'm gonna do at this point for a while is just gonna be repetition so I'm just gonna be doing the same thing that I did with this to all of these and then at that point I would maybe start working on something else related to this so I think I'm kind of at the point where by the time I would get all this done I would want to end the stream anyway so instead of just repeating the exact same thing that I did which I don't think would be very helpful I think I'm gonna take the questions us simply because the there's so much in the live chat I'm only halfway through everything that was in there so I definitely want to get to the questions also I might I do kind of want to get out of work at a decent time because I think I need to go to the doctor's so I actually I hurt my wrist so I don't know you might have noticed if you watched on the Instagram feed that I was holding my wrist so told my right hand and I'm righthanded and maybe like a month ago I was like playing with my kids in the pool when I was throwing them and at some point like after I've been throwing them for a really long time and I was tired I lifted one of them up and I just felt something like it's pain in my wrist and I just tried to be tough and say like oh that's no big deal it'll be fine and I never did anything about it and it slowly gotten worse and worse every day to the point now where if I use my wrist at all it hurts and that's a problem because obviously like I I need to move my wrist around like even moving my wrist around to select things you know like on the screen you know to move the cursor around hurts so I think I probably ought to go to the doctor's just on the off chance that maybe something serious at least maybe should get like some sort of brace or something so that I can not move it as much because right now it's just really hard not to move it like I always some like picking up the baby you're doing something and I just keep making it worse anyway enough about that I'm sure no one watches this for my health updates let's see but I guess it is it is a good lesson if you're a developer you need your hands most likely to work so take care of them and don't put off getting them checked out if you've heard something alright so at this point if you are here for the code and you don't want to stick around for the question and answer session thank you so much for watching and you can you can safely tune out probably won't be doing any more coding and I'll be back tomorrow most likely at the same time otherwise if you can stick around for a little bit longer and have a question or want to help out and answering some questions then check out the live chat put your question in there if you're shy you can just direct message me on Twitter and I'll try to get you a question whenever I can or if you can't stick around to hear my answer you can either catch the answer later on if you watch the recording of this or you can message me some other way on Twitter or some other social media the link for my Twitter is in the description okay I hadn't said that in a while so I figured I may as well say it for anyone that's new and doesn't know how the stream kind of works so unofficially the stream is split up into two parts the code part and the question and answer part all right so we're still talking about in in regard to the motivation thing so well Mary says I have have a few things that help with motivate group coworking not so much teamwork but working around other people working so sharing that working energy oh that's cool yeah I could I can see that so maybe actually I have rarely done this but I see a lot of people especially like coders on Instagram always for posting pictures of them working at a cafe or something with other people so I don't do that a lot just because where I'm at there's not really a lot of cafes with good WiFi that you could go and work at this it's not not an option for me but I think that's kind of at least it seems popular from from what I see online so good advice thank you Yosef says by the way I'm learning Ajax and listen to your live coding in the background to help me to get motivated oh cool all right so I guess my live coding can be motivation as well I could definitely see my live coding being motivation for somebody saying like how how does this guy have a live stream on YouTube that people watch and like I'm better than him how does this okay I could see people being motivated by that but anyway I appreciate that appreciate you saying that well Patrick says the brain food Spotify playlist off to check that out I don't know if I've listened to the brain food playlist maybe I have at some point yeah definitely if you um if you like listening to music and you can spare the I don't know like ten dollars or less a month to get Spotify Premium I definitely recommend that and I this is not sponsored by Spotify this is my honest opinion my productivity went up when I got Spotify Premium because the commercials got so annoying for me it broke my train of thought and it really did help to get spotify premium so i think that's a legitimate business expense so if you don't have it try it out sometimes they have really good deals where you can get like three months for 99 cents a month or something like that so try it out whenever one of those deals happen that that really helped me out Rohan says working with a couple of people who are motivated enough can be a push for everyone but teams generally take motivation away okay that's interesting so yeah I can agree with that I guess it depends on who you're working with on your team I would say there there are some people and some personalities that are just a drain on the team but then sometimes there are people that are just so positive that it it does help I know there there used to be someone that worked in my department and she retired but even now when I see her every time I see her she tells me oh Jessie you're so smart you can do anything you're going places and she always says that I always laugh you know but that makes me feel so good about myself and she's she's not I mean she I think genuinely believes that and she would convince me like once I applied for a job that was way out of my league and it was partly because she convinced me and talked me up that I that I should do it that I would be great at it so people like that can help you be motivated really positive upbeat people I think are great for motivating you so if you have people like that in your life hang out around them more often or try to find somebody like that and make them your friend okay it looks like okay cool so Kevin is giving me some some links I'm gonna copy these and check these out after the stream okay all right I see this one definitely looks helpful is exactly what we want to do using create react app with react router and Express j/s this this is exactly what we're doing okay cool so thank you thank you Kevin definitely gonna check that out yeah Rowan says node modules isn't traced by get yeah actually so by it by default node modules can be traced but I get so you you do have to put it in your git ignore file so let me let me show you this actually because I do see this occasionally the people will have their node modules in their repo so it's really easy fix here within your get ignore file if you don't have this in your project like you can just copy it from somebody else's project that's similar to yours if you need to I never make these from scratch I always copy it from either a previous project of mine or a similar project I have someone else's and you want to say don't track node modules and then you know there's other stuff in here this one was created automatically when I did create react app but if you were doing the project from scratch then this wouldn't be there automatically so you would have to put it in if you happen to do your project and setup get and forget to do this first and then you want to ignore your files later on you got you have to run a few commands to get that to work so let me I actually just did this some someone wanted me to take a look at their project and so I I cloned it and the node modules were being tracked so I sent a pool request basically just uploading a GUID ignore I think I changed a few other things but one of the things I changed for them was I put this in so let me let me just show you how to do that quickly I guess I'm not well I'm not going to be able to show you because obviously I have it I have it set up the right way but let me show you where I guess I can at least give you the resource that I use because it's happened in the several times so it would be useful let's see I'm trying to tape on my other screen to show you this resource but I can't type today so all right there we go so what you want to do is get you want to do a git RM cache and then you can put the name of your file if it's just one file or like let's say you just you didn't have this at all and there's a bunch of stuff and now you upload your get ignore file or you create your get ignore file then you can just do like alright you want to do the die you want to do everything and then you can go ahead with adding your your other files so you can do a git status it'll show you everything and then you want to add and then push the changes so I'm pretty sure that's how I've done it before I just I was looking for that command so that's what you want to do to get everything back back in order and let me know I'm sure you'll let me know in the live chat if I've missed something here and someone has noticed that I'm missing something important but there's like there's a ton of Stack Overflow questions about that so I'm sure you'll you'll be able to find something you know if you need a little bit more instruction on that ok Dixie says I find watching Jesse's live streams give me gets me motivated seeing him go through the errors and everything is comforting to me at least a hug good food food and music can help too yeah I like that comment I've had a few times I've had people say like that they they like that I make mistakes and work through them and I really I like that comment because that was really my one of like the the main points of this was to show people that I make mistakes and because a lot of your tutorial videos like they edit out any mistakes right you know you want to keep the videos as short as possible and to the point so you edit out the mistakes so I wanted people to see the mistakes so you know they don't get the impression that if they're making mistakes somehow there's something wrong with them when in reality we all make mistakes all the time but it's always funny when I get that because I know people mean it as a compliment but in the back of my mind I'm thinking like like everybody likes just watching me mess up and I know that's not how you how you all mean it but it's just funny to me that in in a sense that's true right like the main draw of this live stream is the fact that I mess up and try to work through it so I don't know maybe it's just me but I think that's kind of that's kind of funny it's amusing but anyway Dixie thanks for saying that I'm glad that that that's comforting to you that's that that's definitely what I what I intend is you know for people to feel a little bit better when they make a mistake because they see me make so many John Hanson said you're gonna need some heavy metal music before going before you hit that Enter key to eject so yeah if I would have seen that I could have switched to some some heavy metal but I think I didn't see it in time so actually my Spotify stopped I made it through this big playlist and so just stops I just restarted it again Patrick says what is the point of using it if you can't feel confident that you can branch an experiment just use a branch you can always clone from github yeah that's what I thought that's what I thought too at first Patrick it was actually kind of cool the way I did it in another folder and then it was easier to compare them sidebyside I know I could have just switched back and forth from the branches but I'm I'm actually like a little bit interested in going in now to that where the the other directory where I each acted and just messing with things and possibly breaking it but I don't know to me now I like inadvertently have a little playground now that I can mess with all the configurations so I'm kind of I'm thinking if I get a little bit of time I can go mess around and maybe learn webpack a bit a bit better so anyway it turned out alright I definitely agree like I I had figured I could just make a branch and then I was kind of secondguessing myself there and just went with the entirely safe route but for future reference for anybody it should have been fine to just make a branch and do do the eject on the branch and I could have just switched back and or Kalandar so so I do I do great Patrick and Kevin looks like Kevin was agreeing with Patrick as well aha I mentioned earlier that when I open up a new tab its it's github its first and I said that I was I was proud of that I was afraid it would be Netflix rhoann says his Netflix I don't mean anything bad by that if you're if you tab who's Netflix that's I like Netflix to although my Netflix isn't hasn't been working I suspect that my wife canceled the Netflix account and didn't tell me I keep forgetting that to ask her about it but every time I try to watch Netflix for the last like few days it hasn't worked but anyway don't feel bad if yours is his Netflix on the merits this is my work computer by the way so maybe that would that would make a difference I never watch Netflix on this computer haha bill said is his local host haha that's awesome that's that's a that's really cool oh that's right okay so I see Kevin says you don't need a password not even a github account to clone just to push that's right thanks Kevin thank you for clarifying that anyway I don't know what I was thinking but when I went in when I when I showed you all how to clone from github I mistakenly said that if he went with the HTTPS you would have to put in your password but that was wrong you only need your password if you were to then try to push to a repo that you've cloned with the HTTPS so don't worry about you can clone and as as Kevin said in the live chat you don't even need to have a github account to clone using the HTTP link so forget what I said earlier that was a mistake hopefully hopefully I didn't mislead anyone there but yet only if you're going to push does the password come into play so sorry about that okay so aim high says have you finished your react nano degree course so that was asked a while ago so not sure if you're still around to get the answer but I haven't finished it yet so the way it the way it works is the courses don't start so like I started the first part I just wanna show you how this works basically the courses are split up and they have start dates so I finished the first part so the curriculum here I finished react the introduction and react fundamentals but the next section react and redux starts in six days 21 hours 22 minutes and 14 seconds so I can't take it now so I have been doing some of the extracurricular stuff so I started like the ex6 es6 things so these are just like you don't need to do these to complete the course but they're just in addition which i think is cool so they have stuff on here 6 asynchronous JavaScript getting github and then career feedback stuff so like helping you with your resume you get up profile LinkedIn so I'm gonna work on these when I have time until the next one gets up and running so this one is starts in six days and then the last one react native doesn't start to 441 days so I will not be through with this course anytime soon but anyway that's how it works so I was I was a little bit surprised cuz the other some of the other courses don't work like this this was this is different so not everything on Udacity works like this all right so me media mij a not sure how to pronounce that so I'm gonna say media but I'm pretty sure that's not right so let me know how you would like me to pronounce that but anyway the question is what is enjoy what is the enjoyable part of doing react app don don xavier says simplicity and decoupling for me at least and youth so yeah I guess I mean what am I like right I don't know I kind of like react there's some features of react that we're really useful to me so like serverside rendering so being able to do serverside rendering which is not a new thing right like you can serverside render and other link like PHP you know like but being able to service that render and then use the all the same stuff to do clientside clientside routing that's really cool and useful I like that I kind of I I thought it was weird at first to mix in JavaScript and HTML and CSS but now I think it's kind of cool to do it all in one place and have it all like all together for each component so that's that's really cool if I probably if I thought about it more I would think of some other things but just off the top of my head that's that's kind of what I like what's what's enjoyable for me about it and acts honestly this might sound bad but if I'm being totally honest react is just like the cool thing to do right now I mean this is not a good reason to choose something so I think react is good in itself but it is a little bit cool to be like doing the using the thing that everybody is talking about on Twitter and stuff right like I'm not saying that that's a good reason but I'm just saying that that's that's a bonus right whenever you know ever I can honestly say that like I'm using technology that's being used by some of the big tech companies and some of the latest like coolest things that are coming out I like being able to say that right that's that's nice that I don't I never like saying like yeah I'm building stuff with technology that's outdated right that's not I would never want to say that hey I would never say that with pride right but it's it's kind of cool to say like hey react is a somewhat new technology that is being adopted by a lot of like cuttingedge companies and I'm using that so that's really that's kind of cool too like I said not not the reason you'd never want to pick something just because you think it's cool or you know popular at the moment but it's a bonus if the thing that you like for other you know reasons also is cool okay me just said this looks like suffering but I support efforts yeah I guess it may look like suffering it sometimes but sometimes like stuff works and it works out well and it's really cool so yes it just depends depends on what you're doing all right don't Savior so seeing this for the first time it looks like a rollercoaster ride but once you delve into it it's simple yeah yeah I mean it does it gets a lot easier bill says I had to come back to react about three times before I finally click now it's my goto when doing any project to the point where if I sit down to write plain old HTML I stall for a minute yeah definitely Don Xavier says seen here me just says I hope it becomes funnier at some point more fun yeah yeah definitely react took me a while to get used to as well so I think things don't start to get fun until you really get the hang of it III think a lot of things are like that not just with programming so it's probably not gonna seem that fun at first but once you're comfortable with it it does get more fun like I I've found it to be more fun like I went back and redid one of my projects for free code camp and react that I had originally done with jQuery and I thought it was just it was more fun to make with react the second time around than it was with jQuery so I mean little comparisons like that definitely make me realize that I enjoy using react but I didn't always it was really frustrating at first Sebastian says arrow function and no need to bind okay cool let me so I remember exactly what I was doing at that point so let me show you just so we all know what we're talking about so I copied this from the documentation the react documentation basically I just copied it because I was I was thinking well I'm gonna copy everything over so I make sure this works but when I was copying it I kind of thought there's got to be a better way to do this and in fact there is if you use arrow functions then you don't have to do this because that that takes care of it so you definitely need to change this up but just just know that this line here is definitely not necessary let's see Don Xavier says when you start using es6 and Redux with it it's a whole lot of fun yeah for sure when you get to hanging up some of the stuff in es6 it is fun like I mean this is kind of simple but like template literals template literals changed my life alright so and me it made things so much more simple you know I at one point I was doing it seemed like everything I was doing required me to make these long like strings concatenate all these things together and then template literals you know like I learned about him and it was just like wow is this just save me so much time and then like you've been able to use let and const like it took me a while to get the hang of when I should use let and Const and what they are good for but now like it makes a lot of sense and that's not it's not there's a lot of other things in es6 that come in handy like like arrow functions right I don't know react would be so much harder without arrow functions so anyway that's that's cool I haven't done a lot with Redux yet but I've seen some things at like some presentations at conferences and on YouTube about Redux and it looks really cool so I'm looking forward to learning more about it da bill says I only have a few packets of G fuel left need to order a tub of powder soon yeah definitely so I as you probably heard me say before I drink g fuel for my caffeine often when I'm streaming and Bill chatted out as well so that's pretty cool I need to see if I get like some sort of an affiliate code or something so like I can give it out to you guys and you can get like a certain percent off and then I get some money or something or at least some free G fuel I should do that actually I had an idea this morning the I should try to get like all of my referral codes and things that I have from various things and then just put them on a website somewhere so that you all can get discounts like you know I have those codes sometimes where it's like if someone uses your discount code they get like $10 off or like $10 and credit and you do it would be cool to like have that and then that way if you are gonna use something anyway you might be able to get a discount and then as a bonus I might get something out of it that might be cool and then you guys could see what products I use I guess I mean especially with with tech stuff you might be interested in that so maybe I'll do that at some point not really high on my priority list right now but that might be a cool thing it might save you also money and if I were to do that it would have just been it would be me officially free code camp would not be endorsing any of the stuff that I put on there so I don't want to imply that at all let's see Kevin says by the way the syntax for name inside the object literal is a new thing from es6 it's called computed property names all right cool yeah actually thanks for pointing that out so I totally skipped over that and just didn't say anything but this is really cool so if you let me let me go to in the documentation they have so they explain this so here we go so that part is es6 computed property name so if you want to learn more about it check out you know this page and the react documentation the page on forms but in es5 you have to write all of this right so you'd have to have a variable for partial state which would be an object and then partial state name would be given the value and then this set state partial state right so a lot of stuff can be boiled down to just this really cool and thanks for for bringing it up I feel like you all are like catching so many things that I'm either like saying wrong or didn't explain so thank you you guys are helping you you all are helping this stream be so much better especially today Rud Rud rang shoe not sure about the name sorry if I'm messing it up says anyone know any good tutorials for Redux I always get lost when I see Redux I don't really know like I said I don't really know Redux that well so I can't help you I think the learn code Academy YouTube channel has some videos on redux I like vaguely remember watching them a while ago they're pretty old so I'm not sure how much if Redux has changed a lot but I think some of the basic ideas behind it are still the same so they might be helpful as an introduction other than that I'm about to take the Udacity course on Redux so I'll be able to let you know if it's good in about a month or so Goggin asks just being curious if you tried Gatsby Jas I have not tried Gatsby yet but I've had some some people recommend it to me so I'd like to try at some point but haven't tried it yet bill says the docs for Redux have some good examples beyond that udemy and Udacity are great resources okay cool okay wearing shoe is asking for if there's free ones you get me paid yeah so yeah definitely infinitely free ones well I mean the YouTube thing that I was talking about would obviously not be paid the Udacity is definitely paid udemy as well bill says free code camp has some lessons in beta or alpha right now can't recall yeah you could check out the beta free code camp curriculum and see what they have there it might be worth it you just skip ahead and do a couple of the the lessons in the beta curriculum the Philip says you are away nerdier than I thought what did I I don't know when was that that was like an hour ago he said that so I don't remember what I was talking about when I he said I was in their year so they let me know what I was talking about cuz I can't I don't disagree that I'm a nerdy person but I was just wondering what I said that was nerdy ok so west boss has a free Redux tutorial so Sarah Sarah says West's boss says free Redux tutorial awesome thank you for that egghead dot io / redux free tutorials as well cool I got some good resources here Scott Co has a resource this from from dawn Xavier and the great code adventure has one as well okay Joseph before I was using exact wrong with my link and Joseph says exact is used in nav like and route okay cool thanks for clarifying that for me Omar says fan from Egypt Jesse is this project has this project have a backend part not right now it may end up having some somewhat of a backend I haven't sided for sure yet I was actually checked I mean you can if you can read my tabs I was checking out MongoDB and CouchDB just to see if I wanted to try those out for this project it's not necessary but we are going to be collecting data and file uploads so I had considered maybe having some sort of a database to keep track of all that but it's not 100% necessary currently I'm keeping track of that by and in the live version of this that we're remaking the data gets sent out in emails it goes to a Google sheet and it goes to our project management system and that's all you know through api's but it's all done clientside which i don't want to do anymore so potentially I don't need another database since the data is already being stored but it does make me a bit nervous that I'm relying on like all this clientside API calls I'm just not a hundred percent like sure that that's the most reliable way to do things and I have had some instances where the the file uploads didn't go through so I know somebody try to upload a file because I got the file name but the actual file never went through so that worries me that it's like there's something slipping through the cracks and I don't know what the issue is yeah so anyway I'm thinking about it but I'm just not sure not sure exactly what I want to do about it I say it says do you think Linux or Mac is a better development environment for a web developer I I don't think I can answer that correctly because I so far I've only used Linux on servers I would like to use Linux I think my next laptop is probably gonna be Linux I'd really like to try it out I'm right now I develop almost yeah pretty much entirely on Mac I don't even remember the last time I used a PC to develop anything with but I I really like the experience that I have on a Mac for developing though like I said I I don't have anything to compare it to in terms of Linux all right Blake says or Windows versus Mac yeah honestly I I will have to say I've had a better experience developing on a Mac than I have on Windows and I developed exclusively on Windows for years before I switched to Mac and I didn't have a problem with it the only reason I switched is because the department I work in has all Macs so I thought ok I'll just use a Mac and instead of being the odd one out so I used the Mac and once after I got used to it I really really liked it I liked it enough that I ended up buying a macbook for myself because i've been using an imac at work so yeah I I prefer a Mac if we're talking Mac versus Windows I prefer Mac for development obviously though if we're talking about gaming I definitely go with Windows if if we're gonna do some gaming stuff but yeah so that's my opinion I know there's strong opinions either way on on that subject of operating system okay Patrick says did you use I'm trying to see like the empty quotes rather than and bsp for a reason I'm not sure where that was at I'm not okay I'm thinking I'm guessing you're talking about this here this gets added in automatically so I keep seeing these I'm assuming this is something that happens is when prettier runs on one commit so I I there's no reason why I'm putting these in cuz I'm not doing it it just is put in automatically so I'm not I'm not even sure why it doesn't really mess anything up that I've seen but I'm guessing that's what you were referring to brian says but yarn has neat icons when you run it until n PM has icons I'll stick with yarn and then a little winking emoji that's a that's legit reason that's the most compelling reason I've heard so far to use yarn I think so I'll go with that does it seem to me like yarn and NPM are so similar in what they do that I just I don't think it matters that much which one you use it's so I mean that the debate is good you know to try to figure out which one is the better thing to use but I don't think it really has impacted my development experience that much to use either yarn or NPM okay Rohan says you usually require extra tinkering to set up dev environment on Windows actually I I do that was true for me I don't know if it's different cuz I'm I set everything up on Windows 7 so maybe things are easier now I don't really know but at least on Windows 7 it's it did seem like it was more difficult to get everything running in terms of my dev environment but I will say that I was much less experienced when I did that so when I was setting everything up on a Mac I had already worked through everything on Windows twice before because I think I had my hard drive crash and I had to get a new one so I did it I didn't set it up twice so who knows maybe it was my inexperience that made it seem like it was more difficult but it definitely did seem like it just didn't run quite as smoothly Patrick says graph QL is the future yeah I agree Don Xavier says graph QL this is when we were I was talking a little while ago about someone had asked a question about whether or not they should learn graph graph QL if they were going to be a reactive so in regard to that Don Xavier says graph QL unless the client or boss asked for it otherwise simple REST API calls do the trick and more even if it becomes if until it becomes a standard when can I reuse rust api's ok not sure the end of that I was a little confused with but basically I think I get what you're saying is like REST API calls are fine now if graph QL does become a standard then you can always replace that though I kind of think that was it which I think that makes sense basically like I think at this point it's still safe to hold off on learning graph QL if you really aren't sure about it yet there's definitely be time to pick it up if in fact graph QL does really become the thing that replaces REST API Giordano says hey Jessie I have a question when the beta site will come online I'm assuming you're talking about the free code camp beta curriculum correct me if I'm wrong the answer I think officially is soon so check out I think Quincy has had like a forum post or blog post or something about it recently so but I think honestly it's like it's gonna come out when it's ready and we're not really sure when it will be ready I'm not actually working on it so I don't have you know any like inside knowledge about it or anything like that so officially I think there is no release date so I think they just don't want to release it until it's ready bill says I don't like right left scroll because I tend to accidentally swipe back and forth back and forward a page from a Mac yeah I do that patrick said refactor those into a map over the data like name phone email dot map okay cool off to see I have to check that out later on I'm gonna try wow the shames been going on for over two hours now so let me I'm gonna skip and just go to the questions in the live chat and just try to answer some of the questions especially if there's some from some new people okay Rohan asks how many people actually drop out after your end of coding announcement actually not a lot we're like it like 37 viewers now I think I think we'd better closer to 50 teachers I didn't really pay attention this time the most we had in the stream was 60 at one time just for today's stream and so now we're you know we're down to 37 so I usually don't drop too many I would say like never more than like 25% of people drop out okay cool Patrick says you can set up a global get ignore so you don't accidentally add node modules okay that's that's really really good advice I need to do that you know what I knew that at some point and then totally forgot about it that's a great idea so I'm not the strees been going on a long time so I'm not going to try to demonstrate this or anything but you can set it up globally so that for any project you're doing it'll automatically ignore node modules so definitely recommend doing that because I can't think of any reason off the top of my head why you would want to include your node modules in your git repo John Hanson says is it best there he asks is it best to have your project all set up to go before building anything before using it I don't know I sometimes I start building out my project before I start using it because there's a lot of basic stuff that I don't really like I know how it's gonna go I don't really need to use get other times I start getting immediately before I do anything I'm not really sure what the best thing would be to do I suppose like if you were working on a team right off the bat then get get up and running but otherwise if it's just you then I don't really see a problem in holding off if you're just going to do some basic setup so not sure I'm you know other people might have some different insight into that into that issue but that's I mean that's what I do okay almost to the bottom of the live chat John Henson says I've got Jesse to blame for getting me started thinking react though I went the react.js route instead of create react app yeah it it's harder it's definitely harder to try to do react from scratch and setup webpack and everything I tried to do that at first as well and and failed so sometimes it's better just to use create react app or next or something like that just to get kind of get started and get comfortable with it and then this learn the other stuff later on if you need to Dixie says with all the mistakes I make it's comforting to see you and be like hey if Jesse can get through it so can i thanks once again I'm very glad to be be comforting to you Jack Bennett asks what's a good language to learn first I'm just starting out it really depends on what you want to do if you want to get into web development then I definitely recommend JavaScript I really I can't really see any reason why or any good argument why a web developer would not want to learn JavaScript because you definitely need it if you're not so much interested in web development then you can pick it you know depending on what you want to do you can pick different things so if if you want to make I Oh s apps I think Swift is what they develop that in for Android is Java and now Kotlin if you just want to learn and you're not don't really sure what you want to do Python seems to be a pretty easy one for beginners yeah I think those are the ones people usually talk about for beginners I mean there's some other ones I know that get used in like beginning computer science courses but I don't know like like Harvard's computer science intro course uses I think it starts with C so not not really sure like if you're trying to teach yourself I'm not sure that's the best place to start bill says in regard to that you can take the concepts to any language so oh I'm sorry I was reading a second comment he said JavaScript with web development all right cool definitely agree with that but you can take the concepts to any language it's just syntax yeah that is true like if you learn one language that the concepts the core concepts can translate well into other languages so it would be easier to pick up another computer language like a programming language once you learn the first one so don't worry too much about what you're going to start out with isaiah's asks what are some good ideas for personal projects in reacts react and redux I don't know if you check out free code camp in some of their challenges I think those are good ideas like it if you're trying to find like a really unique idea to build something that nobody's built I'm not really sure I would say like ask ask friends and family and maybe they'll have some idea otherwise if you're just looking for ideas in general then check out the free code can't challenges and there's a lot of ideas for what to build with user stories and things that will give you some direction assuming you haven't done them already also there's great ok cool so in the live chat there's some some links to some medium article about things you can build ok cool so yeah there are places on the internet that have lists of just ideas for things to build so check that out it looks like the free code can't medium publication has has a post on that so kind of browse browse that and see Blake asks what framework should I use for html5 mobile apps and then Bill says have you thought of trying react native that would be my recommendation as well try out react native have I have not used it yet so I can't say for sure but I've I've heard a lot of good things about it alright I'm just scrolling through the last little bit here trying to see if there's any more questions and I am reading the comments too so if you've come in and I haven't missed that but I'm just kind of I'm not gonna read it out loud just because the video has been really long at this point okay cool I got through everything all right bill says he's gotta run see you later bill all right so I think I've gotten through all the questions really sorry if I missed something asked me again sometime and I'll do my best to answer thank you so much for for watching and for being in the live chat and contributing and for helping me out a lot thanks to Kevin and Sebastian for the pool requests they were awesome and I'll be back tomorrow so until then have a great day
