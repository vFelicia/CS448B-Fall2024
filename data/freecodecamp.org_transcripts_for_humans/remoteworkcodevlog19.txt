00:39 - editing the article it will be about the
00:43 - code block
00:44 - the article will be available in free
00:46 - code scam medium publication
00:49 - [Music]
00:53 - let's talk about getting everyone's job
00:56 - usually working remotely is working on
00:58 - the project and working on the results
01:00 - matters if you are communicative if you
01:01 - do the work on time and if you really
01:04 - deliver what you promised to deliver
01:06 - mode work is not sitting on the beach
01:08 - and doing nothing there are also team
01:10 - meetings there also scrums and other
01:13 - stuff that you have to be really on time
01:15 - in a given place and connect through the
01:17 - good wi-fi connection some people say
01:19 - that it's really
01:21 - not for code movies because you cannot
01:23 - learn from developers who are senior
01:24 - developers but it depends really on the
01:27 - team and the relationships working
01:28 - remotely doesn't mean that you have to
01:30 - be like a digital nomad you can
01:32 - do it your way
01:34 - it's the beginning of the year the first
01:35 - week and because i was planning a lot
01:38 - and also summarizing a lot
01:40 - i also was interested what was the top
01:42 - topic that we talked on free code camp
01:46 - and
01:47 - interestingly majority of the top topics
01:49 - are about getting a developer job
01:52 - and
01:53 - some of them are about six stories and
01:56 - others about about some failures
01:58 - while
01:59 - there's also a group of posts about uh
02:03 - remote wack
02:04 - and uh that's why i decided to share
02:06 - some websites where you can find remote
02:09 - work that may be helpful if you are
02:12 - looking for some
02:14 - remote projects
02:16 - the first two portals i'm starting with
02:19 - and these are the portals for the remote
02:21 - web for freelancers
02:23 - but these portals are quite selective so
02:27 - you have to
02:28 - pass a lot of steps in order to
02:31 - to create your profile there these two
02:33 - portals are all toptol.com
02:38 - majority of the other portals you start
02:40 - up your own account the example is
02:43 - up work you start up your own account
02:45 - you fill in your profile you take the
02:47 - tests whichever you want
02:50 - you got the full access to your account
02:52 - to your profile from the beginning
02:55 - and also from the beginning you are able
02:58 - to
02:59 - start applying for the jobs
03:02 - upwork.com is the combination of all
03:05 - desk and elance uh so previously uh
03:08 - there were two separate portals uh right
03:10 - now it's one portal it's upwork.com
03:13 - and that people from all around the
03:15 - world uh when it comes to clients but
03:18 - also when it comes to developers
03:20 - so don't worry about bidding the prices
03:22 - but simply set your price and
03:25 - start applying that different contracts
03:27 - and different clients you can check the
03:29 - clients you can check the contracts
03:31 - what's good about the upwork is that
03:33 - it's really huge
03:34 - this is one of the portals that i really
03:36 - recommend of course there are different
03:38 - opinions about each one i will present
03:40 - but uh this one i know quite well and i
03:44 - know a lot about success stories not
03:46 - just on es for individual and developers
03:48 - but also for the whole software houses
03:54 - the next one is uh
03:56 - jobs dot remote if io
03:59 - you can of course categorize here the
04:02 - kind of work
04:04 - let's go to engineering
04:07 - all of them are remote and clicking into
04:09 - the offer of course you go to its
04:11 - details
04:13 - another
04:14 - we wack remotely wework remotely.com uh
04:19 - it's also a nice list
04:21 - where you can find not just only
04:23 - developers job
04:25 - but also other stuff but simply you can
04:28 - search for the keywords
04:29 - you get updates when they were published
04:32 - of course when you click
04:33 - you see the
04:35 - whole description remote io is the
04:37 - service that's really similar
04:40 - and you can find here um the dev jobs
04:42 - from different languages
04:48 - the next one working nomads dot co slash
04:51 - jobs what's important in all of this
04:53 - kind of portals is to use categories to
04:56 - search wisely faster and to save your
05:00 - time
05:00 - this is the portal called angel.co here
05:04 - you will find a lot of startup jobs
05:07 - another service
05:09 - wfh dot io the next place we are
05:13 - hirable.com and one more freelancer.com
05:18 - very often the same offer appears
05:21 - on
05:22 - different portals uh some of them
05:25 - aggregate
05:26 - then the japanese from other portals
05:30 - but also the clients very often publish
05:33 - the same offer on different uh channels
05:35 - on different services at stack overflow
05:38 - when you look for remote you can find a
05:41 - lot of offers for different languages
05:44 - you can also find them
05:46 - in codepen io slash jobs but here you
05:50 - have to really look for
05:52 - remote here in the description i want to
05:54 - share some lessons
05:56 - i've learned that i think that can be
05:57 - useful for you if you're wondering this
06:00 - year to start the remote work or to take
06:03 - some remote gigs if you really care
06:05 - about getting a new project the best
06:07 - option is to be active
06:09 - and to be reactive to answer whatever
06:12 - your clients write to you respond the
06:15 - same day and if you have to write a lot
06:17 - of extra stuff that in the response or
06:20 - additional questions to the project
06:22 - or some explanation then at least write
06:25 - that you will write back tomorrow
06:27 - at the same time you keep the content
06:29 - alive you can really rise your status
06:33 - among the other candidates by sharing
06:37 - by being the person who is really
06:39 - searchable online i've noticed that
06:42 - providing information
06:44 - that's really um that's really important
06:47 - for the given job
06:49 - is important in the answer in the offer
06:51 - but it's also great if you have a
06:55 - current linkedin account if you have
06:57 - some blog if you write some articles if
06:59 - you share some content if you spread the
07:02 - news about what you know if you help
07:04 - others
07:05 - because this way the person with whom
07:08 - you want to work may simply
07:10 - easily notice you online and simply
07:12 - check whether you are reliable or not in
07:15 - what you are saying in this offer in the
07:17 - journey of these portals you can also
07:19 - create your
07:21 - accounts your profiles and add your
07:23 - portfolio items or additional links and
07:26 - version additional resources about you
07:29 - don't omit it whether the tests you can
07:32 - also take the test some of them like um
07:36 - on artwork in them in my opinion they
07:38 - are very very
07:40 - theoretical one but at the same time
07:43 - that some people there are some clients
07:45 - that look at your profile at your um at
07:48 - your profile at these portals really
07:51 - from the top to the bottom so if you
07:53 - have an empty account if you don't have
07:55 - any references if you don't have any
07:58 - portfolio items if you don't have any
08:00 - information about you about uh what you
08:02 - did so far why you that the other person
08:05 - is the best person for the project
08:08 - they simply may go to the next candidate
08:11 - yes it's a kind of work it takes time to
08:13 - prepare it but later you can use the
08:15 - same content on the other portals
08:18 - because usually um their questions
08:21 - repeat we're preparing your profile you
08:23 - can do a lot of copy and paste
08:26 - from linkedin from other portals that
08:29 - you are already in
08:32 - it's not the same
08:34 - when applying to the offers
08:36 - treat
08:37 - clients individually don't resign from a
08:40 - given portal just only because somebody
08:43 - somebody from your friends didn't have
08:46 - luck there
08:47 - because maybe they had a different
08:49 - account maybe they have different skills
08:51 - maybe they didn't look a lot maybe
08:54 - they
08:55 - did a poor job
08:57 - you should try something on your own
09:01 - [Music]
09:08 - i got one big news for you i started
09:11 - um uploading my content uploading my
09:13 - vlogs
