00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with Jessie today we're going to finish
00:11 - up this footer I took the morning off to
00:15 - watch my kids when my wife had a
00:17 - doctor's appointment so I haven't done
00:20 - much but I had one really good idea at
00:23 - least it seems good now I only had it
00:25 - five minutes ago so we'll see we kept
00:29 - having some conflicts with the Styles
00:31 - yesterday when we were working on this
00:33 - footer so I I thought why are we even
00:36 - keeping the old styles we took
00:40 - everything off of this page so we don't
00:43 - need any of them so I went in went to
00:47 - the top of our main master template here
00:51 - and I commented out all this ESS and
00:56 - when I did that it changed to the footer
01:02 - Abed all of this stayed the same which
01:04 - which is good it should have but down
01:08 - here in the footer I have a little
01:11 - little difference here if you remember
01:13 - we had a different font and we had a
01:15 - shadow on it before and we had some you
01:20 - know buttons this was stabbed more like
01:22 - a button all these links so now this is
01:28 - using the materialized Styles still
01:31 - needs a little bit of work but now we
01:34 - won't have to fight with all those with
01:37 - all the styles that are there now what
01:40 - this does mean is that we're not going
01:43 - to be able to keep any of the elements
01:45 - that we're there like intact as is which
01:48 - is okay with me you know they're they
01:52 - all needed to be redone anyway but I
01:56 - think this will make things a lot easier
01:58 - for us it'll be pretty straightforward
02:01 - now when we try to do something with
02:04 - with materialized it should work and all
02:08 - we have to worry about is just any
02:10 - customizations that we need to make on
02:12 - top of materia
02:14 - so today I'd like to get this looking
02:19 - exactly the way that we want to we want
02:22 - it to look I'm thinking two Pomodoro
02:25 - sessions so two 25-minute sessions of
02:27 - code in between we'll do our five
02:30 - minutes of question-and-answer and then
02:32 - we'll finish up with some question and
02:34 - answer it should be about an hour and a
02:35 - half
02:37 - assuming we get the normal number of
02:39 - questions and during that time what I'd
02:42 - like to accomplish is getting these
02:45 - headers to all be the same
02:47 - and I'd like everything to be aligned to
02:51 - the right these need to be buttons
02:57 - according to basically this well either
03:03 - you know what you know what I like
03:05 - better on on a dark background like this
03:10 - I actually like what I call the inverted
03:13 - button so I probably didn't make that up
03:15 - I'm sure I got it at some point from
03:17 - somewhere but I I don't remember where I
03:19 - got that term from so basically you if
03:22 - you don't understand you'll see when we
03:24 - do it but it's going to be just a white
03:26 - outline of a button and you'll be able
03:29 - to see the green behind it
03:31 - so we're gonna do those buttons we're
03:36 - gonna fix this so that it looks a little
03:39 - bit nicer and then we'll double-check on
03:42 - a few screen sizes how everything stacks
03:44 - up that's not okay yeah so that's not
03:52 - too much but it's going to be nice
03:53 - especially for for those of you who
03:55 - maybe are just getting into things with
03:58 - CSS and aren't super confident with
04:01 - doing things with CSS or maybe just
04:03 - working with materialise so I would say
04:08 - at a level of difficulty this one's
04:10 - going to be like down at like a 1 or 2
04:12 - you know it's going to be a really
04:14 - beginner friendly stream but if you're
04:17 - not a beginner you know please stick
04:19 - around because we're still you know can
04:21 - get into some more in depth
04:23 - in the question and answer sessions and
04:25 - there's always people asking questions
04:28 - that are you know unrelated to what we
04:30 - happen to be doing in this particular
04:32 - stream so I see in just a few people in
04:36 - the live chat so hey how's it going
04:38 - thanks for joining us so I did schedule
04:42 - this stream a little bit later than
04:44 - normal so we have not quite as many
04:46 - viewers as we normally do at this point
04:49 - but that's probably my fault okay John
04:55 - John Hanson says he's getting an echo is
04:59 - anybody else getting an echo let me know
05:01 - it'll be a few seconds because of the
05:04 - delay but it shouldn't be okay I was
05:12 - double checking to make sure that my
05:13 - voice wasn't playing over any speakers
05:16 - here I don't hear anything okay awesome
05:21 - so we'll get started a few I switched
05:23 - back to my main camera so so far I've
05:25 - had no problems with this main camera
05:27 - because I I had to restart my Mac
05:30 - because it froze yesterday right when I
05:33 - was about to leave it froze so I just
05:37 - shut it down and got to it today when I
05:40 - got into the office but the good thing
05:43 - is since I had to restart everything
05:46 - anyway I updated Visual Studio code I
05:49 - updated Adam I updated about 10 packages
05:51 - in Adam so I did a lot of updates that I
05:55 - had been putting off so I guess that's
05:59 - ended up being good and the camera works
06:01 - now so I have my second camera ready to
06:05 - go so I actually have it over on the
06:07 - side sheets help bring it in to the shot
06:10 - but in case this one freezes I'll just
06:14 - bring the other one in and we won't have
06:15 - to mess with it throughout the
06:19 - throughout the stream okay so now we got
06:23 - a little bit more activity here in the
06:25 - live chat I see
06:26 - Umberto's here Hey umberto I got your
06:29 - your direct message on Twitter for
06:32 - a day or two ago I'm sorry I didn't
06:34 - respond to that
06:35 - I checked it and then I didn't have time
06:37 - to respond and then I forgot about it
06:39 - but I just remembered it now when I saw
06:40 - you so sorry about not responding but I
06:43 - did get it so I don't want you to think
06:46 - I'm ignoring you okay let me set my
06:52 - timer we're gonna do 25 minutes of code
06:57 - all right so first thing I think I want
07:00 - to do is get these headers looking you
07:05 - know kind of uniform right now this is
07:07 - an h5 and these are h2s so these are
07:10 - being pulled in from the content
07:12 - management system and we hard-coded this
07:14 - and what I think we ought to do
07:17 - especially now that I see everything
07:22 - without any styles yet you know from
07:24 - with the old styles I think I'd like to
07:27 - just hard code these as well I I don't
07:34 - think that these things change very
07:35 - often I know we talked about this
07:38 - yesterday of things that don't change
07:39 - often and I mean like aren't likely to
07:42 - change more than once a year I don't
07:44 - really have a problem hard coding them
07:46 - because that's not it's not really a big
07:49 - deal for me once a year to go in and
07:51 - change a line or two hopefully this
07:55 - entire site is redone in a year so I may
07:58 - never have to come back in and change
07:59 - anything but I don't want this to be an
08:03 - h2 I don't want these to be as they are
08:07 - I want them to have the proper classes
08:10 - to make them materialize buttons we will
08:12 - have to so they don't have that inverted
08:14 - button style and materialize by default
08:16 - at least they didn't the last time I
08:18 - checked there yet they are always adding
08:19 - new things so it's possible I missed it
08:21 - but I do have some Styles that I've made
08:25 - you know in addition to the materialized
08:28 - styles that work with materialized so
08:30 - it's just kind of a little add-on that I
08:32 - use personally in my project so we'll
08:35 - just have to find that from a previous
08:37 - project and put that in but we're gonna
08:42 - we're going to redo this
08:44 - I think that'll just make things a lot
08:47 - easier once we get that done then we'll
08:50 - work on this down here all right so
08:53 - let's go down the bottom I think
08:56 - actually we should be able to get rid of
08:58 - a lot of this JavaScript now so I'm
09:03 - thinking it's fancy
09:13 - yeah I'm just gonna comment this out
09:15 - right now I will see if we get any
09:17 - errors but there shouldn't be anything
09:19 - on the page that requires this dis
09:23 - JavaScript as we start adding in more
09:26 - elements we might find that we're
09:28 - pulling in something from a template
09:30 - that that does need that and then we'll
09:32 - decide what to do same way we have wait
09:37 - a bit here for for YouTube I don't know
09:42 - that we'll need that I'm not going to go
09:45 - through that now you know we're focusing
09:48 - on the footer right now but we should be
09:50 - able it looks like we should be able to
09:52 - cut down the length of this file
09:54 - significantly so even though we're
09:56 - adding in some hard coded things that
09:58 - we'll add to the length I think we'll be
09:59 - able to cut out enough that it should at
10:02 - least even out hopefully be a bit
10:04 - shorter than it originally was and if it
10:07 - comes down to it we can always separate
10:08 - these things out into their own
10:10 - components if it gets too large so we're
10:15 - looking at these two columns here so
10:19 - this is our Center column and then here
10:22 - we have our our last our right column so
10:27 - let's get rid of these and I think we
10:30 - will need to we will need to go into our
10:40 - CS file so our C sharp file and get rid
10:48 - of some some things some lines in there
10:50 - or else just going to throw an error so
10:54 - let's find that
10:57 - you know like building a folder okay let
11:06 - me let me grab this folder
11:23 - so I see so I'm trying to find this
11:31 - folder and I'm assuming I could just
11:35 - drag it over here I think I can write
11:40 - not see if I can just drag it here whoa
11:46 - okay cool
11:49 - I don't need these this this
12:05 - okay
12:09 - all right so we need to find find where
12:12 - we were
12:24 - there we go master pages so this is what
12:28 - I was looking for
12:30 - oops alright I got a call I gotta take
12:35 - this call so I'm gonna mute my mic and
12:37 - take this
12:45 - you
13:44 - all right sorry about that that was a
13:48 - great time for the normal disclaimer
13:49 - this show is just me doing my normal
13:52 - work as a front-end developer I'm
13:53 - employed at a small university full time
13:56 - so occasionally I do get a knock at the
13:59 - door or a phone call that I need to take
14:01 - so the goal is just to show you what my
14:05 - work day is like and maybe if you're
14:07 - interested in front-end development or
14:09 - you like me pretty much work on your own
14:12 - as a developer and don't know what it's
14:14 - like for other developers I thought this
14:15 - might be kind of helpful to see me doing
14:17 - my thing making mistakes trying to work
14:19 - through it so that's why you know we
14:22 - have interruptions like that and you
14:25 - know I don't mind when it happens I
14:27 - don't like if it's a really long
14:29 - interruption I don't want to waste your
14:30 - time but that one actually was somewhat
14:34 - related to what we're doing so evidently
14:36 - someone is has a link to some page on
14:40 - the main website that from what is
14:44 - described these are the words of the
14:46 - person on the phone not mine that it it
14:48 - works but it doesn't so I don't know
14:53 - what that means but two two guys from
14:56 - the IT department are gonna stop by my
14:58 - office in about an hour and 15 minutes
15:01 - and they said they think it'll be easier
15:04 - if they could just show me which is cool
15:07 - I don't even have to go anywhere so I'm
15:08 - fine with that but anyway I don't mind
15:14 - helping out with stuff like that
15:17 - actually currently right now I'm the
15:19 - only person that knows any web
15:21 - development that has access to these
15:22 - files so I probably am the right person
15:24 - to go to for that in a few weeks though
15:28 - there will be somebody else here working
15:31 - full-time that will have access so it
15:33 - won't all be on me okay so let's I just
15:42 - so Philips just said in the live chat
15:44 - can we do bad lip-syncing while you're
15:48 - on the phone I'd have been hilarious
15:53 - yeah so I early on when I was streaming
15:57 - there are a few times when I get calls
15:58 - and I just talked and everyone can hear
16:01 - what I was saying and then somebody I
16:02 - can't remember who it was but somebody
16:04 - in a live chat was like you really need
16:05 - to mute your mic in case like something
16:07 - is said that shouldn't be said on you
16:10 - know on YouTube for everyone to hear and
16:13 - so that was a good idea so now I am ute
16:16 - when I when I can when I when I remember
16:21 - it because occasionally that happens
16:24 - it's not like big secret things but
16:26 - sometimes since some of the marketing
16:28 - department sometimes we get information
16:29 - before it's released to the public so
16:31 - that we can prepare how we want to say
16:33 - things you know get things ready so
16:36 - occasionally I might know about
16:38 - something before everyone else is
16:40 - supposed to know about it so so I'm not
16:43 - trying to keep you all out of my
16:45 - business you know otherwise I wouldn't
16:47 - really care but that's better safe than
16:51 - sorry with that kind of thing anyway
16:53 - back to the code so we use that that
16:56 - footer so that mid content and right
17:00 - content and we're just going to get rid
17:02 - of all references to those in here as I
17:05 - said earlier otherwise we'll get an
17:07 - error because it's going to be looking
17:09 - for those elements and it's not gonna
17:11 - find them so now we've removed them from
17:14 - this c-sharp file and we'll save that
17:19 - and did we say if I'm not sure if we
17:24 - actually saved this file so we may have
17:30 - to get rid of them again okay it did
17:34 - save awesome so I'm gonna refresh we
17:39 - should see nothing in these columns now
17:40 - and we should get no errors okay awesome
17:43 - great so now what we need to do is set
17:48 - up so we have our column in here and we
17:51 - need to do an H 5 mu nu H 5 great
18:00 - yesterday I had complained that it
18:02 - wasn't Auto completing my my tags my
18:04 - HTML tags and you all had charlie
18:09 - who it was sorry I can't remember who it
18:11 - was that old that said that Emmet is
18:14 - available by default and vs code but
18:19 - whoever was that was awesome
18:21 - so thank you really sorry I can't
18:23 - remember who that was not I'm usually
18:27 - pretty good about that but anyway when I
18:30 - did the update one of the things that
18:32 - said that was in the new update was it
18:35 - completed HTML tags now by default so I
18:38 - was happy about that so let's bring up
18:42 - actually I'm gonna do this on the other
18:44 - screen I'm gonna scroll down here just
18:46 - to see what was in here was supposed to
18:48 - be in here I'm gonna pull that to my
18:49 - other screen so I can copy and paste it
18:51 - easily and then we'll we'll build this
18:58 - out to match that that first column that
19:01 - we had made up here
19:12 - whoa do we want that to be all caps I
19:19 - don't think we want that to be all Cavs
19:25 - we'll see we'll see how it looks but
19:41 - I'm just not sure that I want that much
19:45 - text to be capitalized I kept waiting
19:49 - for the auto refresh I'm just so used to
19:53 - that in my other four objects whoa
19:58 - that's weird I thought we had okay I had
20:07 - added these classes on to this let's see
20:10 - if I really want this I'm gonna add
20:14 - these classes as well but now that I
20:16 - look at it I'm not sure that I want this
20:18 - so the light class is gonna make the
20:21 - font weight smaller so I think it makes
20:23 - it about 400 font weight and then if you
20:27 - add the thin class that makes it 300 we
20:34 - can double check that for sure but I'm
20:37 - pretty sure that's what it is and that's
20:39 - just built built-in to materialise let's
20:44 - see how that looks so I found that okay
20:48 - not bad so I found that I like how the
20:52 - the light and sometimes even the thin
20:56 - font looks but only on my Mac so I have
21:01 - nice screens and it looks good when I
21:04 - try to look at it on an older screen on
21:07 - a Windows computer it looks terrible and
21:09 - you can barely read the text so I just I
21:12 - have to always remember that that before
21:15 - I commit to a font weight I need to
21:20 - check it on older screens especially for
21:23 - I mean really for any site but if it's
21:27 - an internal site I know for sure what
21:29 - kind of screens most people are going to
21:30 - be using because there's pretty much a
21:32 - standard Windows computer we have like
21:34 - lenovo's with the standard sized screen
21:36 - and resolution that I would say like 90%
21:39 - of the people here use so I can be
21:42 - pretty sure of what they're gonna see so
21:46 - we'll see we'll just make sure we
21:48 - double-check that at some point I'm not
21:51 - sure why we're getting
21:53 - why are we getting that space
22:05 - oh okay I had forgotten we actually have
22:09 - an image that's going to show up here
22:12 - I just haven't we don't have the right
22:15 - source so see we have this image we
22:19 - don't have the right source for it yet
22:20 - so we'll just have to get this in here
22:23 - so that explains the difference the
22:27 - difference here which yeah we'll see
22:33 - you'll see I don't know that we actually
22:35 - need another logo down here now that I
22:38 - look at it because we have this sticky
22:42 - header we're always gonna have a logo
22:45 - visible yeah actually let's take this
22:52 - out you know that's one less image that
22:57 - needs to load on the page and I think
23:01 - it'd be an unnecessary image so if we
23:06 - can remove it then great alright awesome
23:11 - okay we're just going to put in just a
23:13 - regular paragraph tag and then we'll get
23:18 - to those buttons the buttons will be
23:21 - kind of fun just to see how we can
23:23 - adjust what comes with materialise and
23:27 - just kind of make our own variation on
23:28 - it so let me copy the text here oops
23:46 - I need to remember how did we do this
23:49 - with Emmet there we go I need to
23:51 - remember to start using Emmet because I
23:53 - think it'll be a lot faster than what
23:54 - I'm used to
23:56 - okay I just checked no beer said that
24:01 - says I think it's John B is the one who
24:04 - told you that visual studio code I met
24:06 - by default I think you're right I think
24:07 - it was John B I actually I remember it
24:09 - now because I remember saying that John
24:11 - B like officially had the the tip of the
24:14 - day like the best best comment in there
24:17 - something like that for telling me that
24:19 - so anyway I don't I don't see John B in
24:22 - here so might not be watching but if you
24:24 - catch the replay thanks again John B
24:25 - sorry I forgot that it was you but thank
24:29 - you because that that is gonna save me
24:31 - so much time
24:33 - I'm sure once I get the hang of it okay
24:38 - let's see and I want to change so this
24:41 - should not be two hyphens obviously that
24:44 - needs to be an M - so I'm gonna look I'm
24:54 - gonna look up the code for that -
25:05 - let's see
25:16 - okay so we'll replace this with an M -
25:19 - and you'll see I'll show you the
25:22 - difference in case you're not sure
25:23 - what's what's going on so all right so
25:33 - I'm gonna zoom in otherwise it's not
25:35 - really gonna be obvious and I'll pull
25:37 - this over as well so if you you can see
25:43 - on this one we have two hyphens and
25:47 - there's click it's clearly to life as
25:49 - you can see the space in between it
25:51 - right here we have a real - all right so
25:55 - that's what we're supposed to have here
25:58 - so this was probably maybe copy and
26:03 - pasted from somewhere or entered into a
26:06 - WYSIWYG editor and it was probably if it
26:09 - was copy and pasted let's say like from
26:11 - a Word document sometimes if you put two
26:14 - hyphens next to each other depending on
26:16 - the editor it'll automatically switch it
26:18 - to this - so I'm assuming that that's
26:21 - something like what happened and when it
26:23 - got copy and pasted it it stayed is the
26:26 - - two hyphens I don't know but anyway
26:29 - when we see something like that will
26:31 - definitely replace it with the HTML code
26:35 - for that and then one will make sure you
26:38 - know they don't it'll render properly
26:41 - okay let's get rid of this Center right
26:46 - so you don't want that and we don't want
26:53 - the center here either
26:57 - and may as well just put in the next the
27:00 - next part here and I'm just gonna copy
27:02 - this paste it and then I'll bring in the
27:09 - rest
27:16 - and probably about out of time for this
27:19 - Pomodoro session so if you got if you're
27:23 - asking any questions I will get to them
27:26 - in just a few minutes
27:39 - and now that we have this in this just
27:41 - at least give us a nice idea of how this
27:43 - is going to look still don't have the
27:44 - buttons and yet but you know we'll get
27:48 - to that I may as well try to add them in
27:50 - here until I hear the the timer go off
27:57 - let's see okay let me do this image
28:05 - though right is it button
28:18 - BTN nah now I can't remember what it is
28:25 - all right let's try it like I can't
28:27 - remember it if I spell out button or if
28:29 - it's BTN so we're about to find out
28:46 - okay cool that was it alright so here's
28:50 - the default style we're gonna go ahead
28:54 - and I'm gonna make put another button in
28:56 - here and then put the button in there
28:57 - and then we'll change the styles to do
29:06 - that inverted button that I was telling
29:10 - you all about at the beginning of the
29:12 - stream so this should give us all the
29:15 - buttons we want there we go great okay
29:22 - obviously they're not all gonna say
29:23 - apply this will say donate this will say
29:25 - visit right now it says visit campus but
29:28 - I I personally prefer shorter button
29:31 - text so I'll just put it as apply and
29:34 - visit and then this will be I'll keep
29:39 - this as donate it says support
29:41 - Franciscan in the button right now which
29:43 - i think is just way too much text for a
29:45 - button
29:47 - so we'll see I'm sure that my boss will
29:51 - let me know if that's if I'm allowed to
29:53 - do that or not at some point but get a
29:58 - minute okay about two minutes left so we
30:02 - can at least start looking for the code
30:04 - that I need for this so like where did I
30:07 - have the inverted button okay you know
30:10 - what we did the inverted button on
30:11 - project one so I just need to look at
30:14 - I had project one all the code open and
30:18 - Adam earlier today and I thought hey I'm
30:21 - not gonna need this anymore right and so
30:23 - I closed it out and here I do need it
30:25 - again so let's just go to github and
30:27 - grab that code and I'll shoot I'm still
30:32 - my incognito window let me go on a
30:35 - window where I'm still logged in and
30:37 - I'll be easier to find it
30:43 - okay see I react yep that's what we want
30:48 - let's see if we can search great okay so
30:54 - here's our button inverted styles so
30:58 - let's grab these and I'm being able to
31:08 - search your entire repository for stuff
31:11 - when github is just amazing like it just
31:14 - it's so fast okay yeah we'll just grab
31:24 - this and this should be yeah it should
31:29 - be fun and let's need to bring up our
31:35 - CSS
31:52 - so for now I'm just gonna save this and
31:55 - I'm gonna apply this button inverted
31:57 - class and see what that actually we're
32:00 - gonna see what that does
32:01 - first thing whenever we get done
32:04 - question-answer so for right now I'm
32:06 - gonna scroll up in the live chat up to
32:08 - the top and just go down through and get
32:10 - through as many questions and comments
32:12 - as I can then we'll do another 25 minute
32:15 - session of code and it looks like we're
32:18 - gonna be able to get this finished in
32:22 - within one more 25-minute session which
32:24 - is great okay so John Hanson said at the
32:35 - beginning of stream that he was getting
32:37 - an echo turns out there were two YouTube
32:39 - windows running at the same time so
32:42 - alright problem solves I'm glad I'm glad
32:46 - it wasn't some issue on my end because I
32:50 - don't really know that much about the
32:52 - audio or the like audio video end of
32:55 - streaming so if it was a problem on my
32:57 - end I would have had the - a lot of
32:59 - research
33:12 - no beer says hi Jessie how are you not
33:18 - bad I mean honestly I have a serious
33:20 - lack of motivation today but other than
33:23 - that not too bad I had some bad news
33:26 - about my wife from the doctor this
33:28 - morning so that's kind of a downer
33:30 - but I think everything's gonna be all
33:31 - right she's gonna have to do some
33:32 - physical therapy for a while
33:35 - but the doctor thinks that she'll she'll
33:38 - recover so it's really crazy that she
33:40 - had major surgery a year ago and this is
33:45 - still related to that surgery she's
33:46 - still trying to get over so I feel
33:48 - really bad for that actually the doctor
33:52 - told her she thinks she has
33:53 - post-traumatic stress disorder from what
33:57 - happened and that like that is actually
34:00 - causing pain for her in addition to the
34:04 - physical problems so that's really
34:07 - stinks I just I can't do anything you
34:09 - know I can't I can't help her so oh I
34:13 - know that was a lot of info sorry
34:15 - usually when people ask how you're doing
34:17 - they're expecting like oh I'm doing
34:19 - alright how you going but anyway so
34:21 - that's how I'm doing right now the
34:25 - stream always gets me going like even if
34:27 - the whole rest of the day I just don't
34:30 - feel like doing anything
34:31 - once once the stream starts and I start
34:34 - talking to you all like at least for
34:36 - that time period I feel motivated to do
34:38 - something so thank you all for that for
34:42 - that motivation and I can usually keep
34:45 - the motivation going for a little while
34:47 - afterwards so at least if I stream I get
34:51 - something done that day something
34:54 - productive done
35:05 - okay John Hanson at some point says
35:08 - never never say never when did I say now
35:11 - I can't remember if I said never about
35:12 - something let me know what I said never
35:14 - about because I cannot remember at all
35:17 - what I was talking about them gold asks
35:21 - what editor are you using I'm sure you
35:23 - got a response to that one yeah
35:25 - definitely so it is Visual Studio code
35:27 - let me flip over to that Visio code so
35:29 - for the first two projects
35:31 - I used Adam switch to visual studio code
35:35 - for this project mostly because when I
35:40 - months ago when I initially started
35:41 - working a little bit with this project
35:45 - things didn't display right the syntax
35:48 - highlighting didn't really work well
35:50 - with the c-sharp files and I had been
35:55 - meaning to try out Visual Studio code
35:57 - anyway so I thought hey let's just try
35:59 - that I just assumed Visual Studio code
36:02 - would probably handle it better and it
36:05 - did so I I just started using it so I
36:09 - think it's cool to show different
36:10 - different editors as well because we
36:12 - always have discussions about what
36:14 - editor is the best so this would be a
36:17 - nice comparison you know that way if you
36:20 - haven't tried it out yet you at least
36:21 - get to see it see what it's like and see
36:24 - the differences
36:34 - okay so rook asks that's cool
36:38 - this person's name and the live chat is
36:40 - rook and then their their avatar is
36:43 - actually a rook from from like the
36:45 - Chesky the chess piece of rook so anyway
36:47 - that's cool
36:49 - my son and I played chess and
36:54 - occasionally so I enjoy a good game of
36:58 - chess every now and then but anyway the
37:02 - question is I saw in a previous video
37:04 - test being done when pushing to github
37:05 - what does that there's a lot of things
37:10 - you could do that that do that in that
37:13 - particular project I'm using something
37:16 - called nightmare and if you check if you
37:21 - check out that project so in that video
37:25 - there'll be a link to the github repo so
37:28 - if you check out the pull request where
37:30 - we added testing so turn that Kevin
37:34 - added that in pretty early on so check
37:37 - out some of the early pool requests and
37:40 - specifically it'll say like testing in
37:44 - in the title of it I can't remember
37:46 - offhand what the the PR number is but
37:49 - Kevin went through a really nice
37:50 - thorough explanation of what kind of
37:54 - testing was being done how it was being
37:56 - done and even some of the other types of
37:58 - testing that we could be doing as well
38:00 - so that explanation is going to be a
38:03 - much better answer than anything I could
38:05 - give you right now in the stream so I
38:07 - would check that out for sure if you're
38:10 - if you're interested in more and how you
38:13 - know how we're doing that alright so my
38:17 - timer did go off let me write down where
38:20 - I left off at
38:24 - [Music]
38:30 - okay and let's go set this timer again
38:38 - alright so we've already brought in the
38:40 - CSS that we need for these buttons I
38:42 - probably brought in more than I needed
38:44 - but yeah I don't know that I need this
38:52 - this gives us maybe we do I think we do
39:03 - I think this is the one we want I think
39:05 - we want the button inverted white this
39:07 - one will give us a black border I don't
39:10 - want a black border on the green if we
39:11 - were going on on a white background this
39:13 - would be okay I don't know what ended up
39:18 - happening here but it seems like I named
39:20 - these differently than I would normally
39:21 - do in a project probably at some point I
39:25 - needed to change him and I didn't bother
39:26 - changing the class name because I don't
39:28 - think this is really what yeah this
39:33 - isn't what I wanted what I normally mean
39:35 - by an inverted button so I'll tell you
39:38 - what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take this
39:41 - out and I'm gonna put in instead I'm
39:47 - gonna take out this white and this
39:53 - should be what we want I think I can
40:00 - double-check that actually I you know
40:07 - what I made a mistake this would have
40:09 - worked these are actually the same thing
40:10 - it's just one as a white border when
40:12 - it's a black border in any case we want
40:15 - the white water one for here I don't
40:16 - think we'll have any need for the black
40:18 - border one so my mistake there at the
40:24 - with that first one I just I I happen to
40:29 - look at the color variable instead of
40:31 - the background color and that messed me
40:34 - up anyway let's just add in
40:38 - class we may not even need but enlarge
40:44 - down here so we'll get rid of that yeah
40:48 - there we go I think we'll get rid of
40:51 - this button large class because I don't
40:53 - want really giant buttons down there I
40:55 - want them to be kind of slim and we'll
40:57 - just put in now I can't remember what it
41:02 - was but inverted okay
41:10 - and let's see what we get it should be a
41:13 - white outline and white text there we go
41:16 - great alright so now we have these when
41:18 - you hover it just fills it up with white
41:22 - okay not bad I think it's it's kind of
41:26 - like more sleek then let's say if we had
41:30 - this this you know very bright color
41:33 - here and I would still say you know in
41:37 - certain circumstances we might want to
41:39 - do that but I don't like having this
41:42 - bright color if we have lots of buttons
41:44 - so we have two buttons right next to
41:46 - each other than a third one not that far
41:47 - away
41:48 - I think it's overwhelming the accent
41:50 - color which is basically what this is
41:52 - the the accent color and I mean this is
41:55 - my opinion here but the accent color is
41:58 - only effective if you use it sparingly
42:02 - it's supposed to draw the eye because
42:04 - it's different and it's vibrant if you
42:08 - use it too much it no longer draws the
42:10 - eye because the eyes used to seeing it
42:13 - right so you you lose whatever benefit
42:17 - that you had from that accent color so
42:20 - if you see right now on the page it's
42:23 - used once the only time you see that
42:26 - color at all is here at this call to
42:30 - action so that's that's how I like to
42:35 - use it now not to say you couldn't use
42:37 - it anywhere else on the page certainly
42:38 - you know as we scroll down this won't be
42:41 - in view anymore you could probably use
42:43 - it somewhere else without really losing
42:46 - the effect but in general I tried not to
42:50 - use it too often on a page okay probably
42:59 - one let's let's put in the correct text
43:03 - in here and just kind of see how it
43:05 - lines up and I may want a little bit of
43:07 - space between these two buttons they're
43:09 - kind of close together otherwise it
43:12 - doesn't look too bad
43:14 - or you know essentially it looks how I
43:16 - wanted it to look so whether or not that
43:18 - looks bad
43:19 - I don't know but
43:24 - we I got down what I wanted to so we're
43:29 - gonna have which one this was apply
43:31 - visit and donates and if we can so I
43:49 - don't want to remove this right now but
43:51 - I think I do want to talk about removing
43:53 - this with my boss because we're gonna
43:54 - have this donate button visible here all
43:57 - the time so we may be able to get rid of
44:00 - this and then put something else useful
44:03 - in here instead of repeating donate or
44:06 - just leave it out all together and we
44:10 - could have just two columns yeah I mean
44:14 - I think well I'm certain that there's
44:17 - something else useful that could go here
44:19 - we don't necessarily need this yeah
44:24 - let's put in let's put in a little bit
44:29 - of padding and bring we use dev tools
44:34 - for this just so that we can see
44:37 - beforehand without having to do a bunch
44:39 - of refreshes what we want to do so let's
44:44 - see I'll do I'm sorry margin left I said
44:51 - padding but I'm we're gonna do margin
44:52 - let's just adding eight pixels I like
44:55 - that let's see eight pixels looks good
45:02 - to me
45:03 - okay so we're gonna add in eight pixels
45:05 - I'm just gonna do this
45:08 - inline yeah I'm just gonna do it inline
45:14 - if I find that I'm using this same kind
45:17 - of pattern a lot then maybe I'll do
45:20 - something else with it maybe I could
45:28 - make it class I don't know I'll figure
45:31 - something out if that happens but I'm
45:33 - not gonna do it right now I think it
45:34 - would
45:34 - be overkill so let's say style and I'm
45:41 - gonna have to remember not to do it the
45:43 - react way have been been in react land
45:47 - for too long and now it it's affecting
45:50 - my basic HTML skills so what do we say
45:55 - margin left and eight pixels it was it
46:09 - was just so hard for me not to put curly
46:11 - brackets in camelcase that and to put
46:14 - comments around that lets verify that I
46:19 - did that right okay great
46:26 - not bad I think this this font size is
46:31 - just way too small
46:33 - I want to double-check and see what size
46:35 - that actually is ooh
46:37 - 10 font size 15 that really man maybe
46:47 - it's just the resolution on my monitor
46:49 - but that looks really small like
46:50 - definitely not 15 I want to see where
46:58 - that's being pulled in
47:09 - I I kind of like having the baseline
47:12 - font size at at least 16 pixels
47:22 - see what that how much of a difference
47:25 - that would make
47:28 - not a lot just a slight difference here
47:46 - for most of the text the interior text
47:49 - in this section we're going to use that
47:50 - materialize that responsive font class
47:55 - that they have but I think the footer
47:58 - can be a smaller smaller font size all
48:05 - right I'm gonna leave that for now I
48:06 - don't have to think about the best way
48:08 - to handle this you know because the
48:10 - fonts being set at several different
48:13 - screen sizes
48:26 - let's just try it out right now I think
48:28 - I'm a let's see I just don't want to
48:32 - override too much so let's see what what
48:38 - happens if we do HTML font size 16
48:46 - pixels we'll save that and let's see
48:51 - what it does
49:03 - and what I want to do is shrink this
49:05 - down and see if it if we're gonna don't
49:11 - write everything and is it gonna look
49:12 - too big on a smaller screen okay and
49:19 - then finally I want to test to see what
49:22 - this does is float X
49:30 - so this is that responsive font okay
49:36 - wonderful all right so that's perfect
49:38 - that's gonna work for us we're basically
49:40 - resetting so that we're at minimum were
49:42 - always having at least a 16 pixel font
49:48 - size but it's not messing up our
49:51 - responsive font so that's good
49:58 - some time with that okay now let's see
50:06 - what else we need whoa I don't like that
50:11 - oh I see what it's like that you know
50:16 - what let's take instead of having a left
50:20 - margin on this second one let's put the
50:24 - margin a right margin on this one so
50:28 - when it gets to when it stacks we don't
50:31 - have this weirdness going on and also we
50:33 - need some we need a margin between these
50:37 - as well so let's just move this off of
50:42 - here put it here and we'll change this
50:48 - from left to right and then while we're
50:57 - in here let's add actually let's just
51:01 - take this off completely let's add a
51:05 - margin
51:06 - of zero right eight pixels bottom eight
51:12 - pixels and then left zero pixels
51:24 - I'm really glad that we decided to do
51:27 - the footer now because otherwise we may
51:30 - have to be like scrolling down a lot to
51:32 - see it it's nice that the page is short
51:34 - here so there's not a whole lot of you
51:38 - know we don't really have to scroll a
51:39 - lot okay that looks nice let's make sure
51:42 - it still looks nice here
51:44 - aha is it no okay
51:56 - okay that's popping that up so I don't
52:02 - think the best thing to do is just to
52:04 - add add a bottom margin here that's just
52:10 - a simplest way to solve this for now
52:32 - so I think at least for me and this is
52:36 - my viewpoint on things if I'm coming
52:38 - into a system like an old system and
52:40 - trying to make things better and it's
52:42 - probably not even going to be around
52:44 - that much longer then I'm of the opinion
52:50 - that it's no it's a waste of time trying
52:54 - to make things in terms of how you're
52:57 - organizing your code and all that try to
52:59 - make things like really like you would
53:03 - if it was a from scratch project so a
53:05 - lot of things reusable and easy for
53:07 - other people to understand right like
53:09 - this is just a patch up job you know to
53:12 - to last us maybe another year until we
53:16 - can have another site so I have very
53:19 - limited time to work on this just until
53:21 - October and then I don't know when I'm
53:23 - going to get another chance to work on
53:25 - it so since we're just trying to get as
53:26 - much as we possibly can done that's why
53:29 - I do I'll do stuff like this right just
53:32 - some inline Styles here because this was
53:37 - the fastest way to solve this problem in
53:40 - a very straightforward way I'm not I'm
53:43 - not really worried about whether or not
53:46 - this is necessarily the technically best
53:48 - way to do it or you know
53:49 - organizationally the best way to do it
53:51 - so another disclaimer there's a good
53:54 - disclaimer these are not tutorials this
53:56 - is not hey I'm doing it the best way
53:58 - possible this is I have various jobs and
54:02 - projects to do with different deadlines
54:05 - this is how I'm getting my stuff done
54:08 - these are the compromises that have to
54:10 - be made because a lot of tutorials are
54:13 - trying to show like this is the best way
54:15 - to do it which is wonderful and I love
54:17 - those tutorials but I thought what was
54:20 - maybe lacking in in terms of videos was
54:24 - videos of someone saying I know this is
54:27 - probably not the best way to do it but
54:30 - here's our deadline and here's all the
54:32 - stuff we have to do so this is what
54:34 - we're going to do now and if we end up
54:36 - getting done early we can always come
54:39 - back and fix it but for right now we
54:40 - need to work because it's been my
54:43 - experience over the last like five years
54:45 - or so
54:46 - projects is that clients just don't
54:50 - always have the money for you to do
54:52 - things the absolutely perfect way and
54:54 - you have to make a decision
54:56 - do I want to just turn down the product
54:58 - the the client do I want to get this
54:59 - finished do I want to you know how do
55:01 - you want to do things right
55:02 - I mean you I don't think it's it's
55:05 - unique to what we do you know I'm sure
55:08 - they're you know when you hire a
55:09 - contractor to work on your house you
55:11 - know he'd love to be able to put in you
55:14 - know granite and marble and you know
55:16 - really nice top-of-the-line everything
55:19 - and that would look amazing we look
55:22 - great in in their portfolio right but
55:25 - not everybody has the money or the time
55:27 - for that so I think it's the same way
55:30 - with us right it'd be great if we could
55:32 - work on projects and do everything how
55:34 - we would want to do it you know
55:36 - completely you know cutting edge doing
55:40 - everything right but that's just not the
55:41 - reality
55:42 - so hopefully this shows a little bit of
55:44 - my reality of how I need to work so I
55:48 - know my other people might have you know
55:50 - different opinions about that but I
55:52 - don't know I'm just practical about it I
55:55 - don't want you anybody to feel bad for
55:58 - just doing the job you know getting
55:59 - things done so long as it works I you
56:07 - know I do want to say I'm not saying cut
56:09 - corners and make something that's not a
56:11 - good product I'm saying just get things
56:13 - done without worrying about little tiny
56:17 - details in terms of code organization
56:20 - I'll stress over tiny details in the UI
56:23 - all day right because that's the user
56:26 - will see that all right but if I had to
56:28 - choose between stressing every UI
56:30 - details or stretching over the
56:31 - organization of my CSS I'm gonna choose
56:33 - the CSS that's user facing the odds of
56:37 - another developer ever even editing this
56:39 - code aside from me are probably less
56:41 - than 1% right now so I'm not worrying
56:45 - about it anyway so I've been sorry for
56:52 - me going off on that but just wanted to
56:58 - kind of explain
57:00 - my viewpoint on that okay so what do we
57:03 - need to do now I got all off-track this
57:06 - we need to get this in a better spot
57:11 - basically what I want this to I want it
57:14 - to be over here on this side and then we
57:16 - need to figure out what its gonna do
57:18 - when we go to a smaller screen I don't
57:22 - want it to do this kind of stuff I'd
57:24 - rather have it be probably on top of
57:28 - this copyright so let's give this a shot
57:38 - I think I'm gonna structure this
57:39 - differently so right now we just we have
57:43 - this so we have this on s12 right so it
57:52 - does stack eventually let's let's change
57:55 - first of all I want to change this just
57:57 - to see what it'll look like just with
58:03 - this kind of minor change so we're gonna
58:06 - switch it up and on medium screens we're
58:08 - gonna go full width to twelve columns
58:12 - and then on large we're gonna split it
58:14 - up let's see how much space that gives
58:16 - us to work with now
58:26 - okay all right not bad I mean obviously
58:29 - I want it reversed but okay so we're at
58:36 - that point I mean all right here's our
58:47 - two options I think we can either make
58:49 - it so that they basically just always
58:51 - stacked except on extra large screens or
58:55 - we can extend these out of their
58:58 - container so that we give them some more
59:01 - space you know in particular like here
59:05 - you know let's say we gave extending
59:08 - them out here and gave them just like 16
59:10 - pixel margin on both sides that would
59:14 - probably be enough space I think I like
59:21 - the first option so let's try that I
59:24 - want to make sure I think that
59:27 - materialized did end up adding in an
59:29 - extra class like an Excel class let's
59:33 - see if it works so we're gonna go large
59:40 - and then X I think that's how they
59:46 - implemented it for a while they didn't
59:48 - have an extra large class and we you had
59:51 - to just make it yourself and then it
59:53 - finally got in to a pool request okay
59:58 - that Excel is what 1200 pixels when is
60:02 - that kick in I think it's
60:10 - yeah
60:30 - so we're still getting you know some of
60:34 - this going on that certain screen widths
60:50 - um I guess I'm okay with that
61:00 - okay
61:15 - yeah I think I'm okay with that but what
61:19 - I need to do though is we need to be
61:26 - able to flip these around so to do that
61:28 - I want to check out
61:30 - I made a class for an earlier project
61:33 - that allowed the easily allowed you
61:39 - without having to create a lot of extra
61:41 - markup to flip at certain screen sizes
61:45 - to flip the order around so I want to
61:48 - check that out first to see if we can
61:52 - apply that here it's been a while since
61:54 - I've used it but it could save us a
61:57 - little bit of time so we're going to go
61:59 - back to github and I'm gonna go to I
62:03 - think I showed you this project
62:04 - yesterday and I don't think it's in the
62:08 - u.s. markup I think it's it's long
62:11 - before we we made this organization it
62:15 - is so it'll be on my my repo profile
62:24 - there we go
62:26 - it'll be on my profile
62:34 - Franciscan Square okay so in the
62:36 - franciscan square site I think I had
62:44 - this wow this is bigger than I thought
62:50 - it would be uh-huh that's why I didn't
62:55 - search I thought I could just scroll
62:56 - through and find it hold on I think I
63:01 - remember what I called it
63:02 - order there we go
63:06 - okay so
63:19 - okay that's what I did
63:30 - so I think I use flex
63:39 - is that my timer Wow the timer went off
63:42 - okay so the only thing that I'm really
63:47 - gonna change
63:48 - I don't want it is completely finish but
63:50 - we're really close the only thing I
63:52 - wanted to change now well there are
63:55 - basically two things I want to make sure
63:57 - that these are kind of on the same line
64:00 - I'm not sure why they're not right now
64:02 - I'll just have to check in dev tools and
64:04 - see I probably have some sort of padding
64:08 - on this or something so I'm going to
64:12 - check that out get these on the same
64:13 - line and then what I'll probably do is
64:19 - just implement some some form of this so
64:23 - what I need to find is where exactly I'm
64:29 - using flex here so I'll just open this
64:34 - site up in dev tools I'll check out one
64:37 - of the one of the columns that I'm using
64:39 - this on and just see what's what's being
64:42 - applied to the parent containers and
64:45 - that should tell me everything that I
64:46 - need to know about that and then
64:49 - basically what will happen is the order
64:52 - property here will flip so that on large
64:57 - screens
65:02 - - no no I'm sorry on small screens so
65:08 - this meeting you queries hang on small
65:10 - screens if it has the class of order one
65:13 - the order will be one that has the class
65:16 - of order - the order will be - so what
65:20 - I'll be able to do then is put and I
65:24 - guess I could put it on here now and
65:25 - then I'll just copy a copy over
65:28 - everything so
65:41 - so what one is this actually needs to be
65:44 - ordered to you want this to come second
65:46 - and that needs to be order one so even
65:48 - though this should always be one based
65:52 - on the markup what will happen is on a
65:56 - small screen they'll flip flop so that
65:59 - this one will be above that one okay
66:02 - now let's let me check the time okay
66:09 - yeah I definitely want to go to do some
66:11 - questions now
66:12 - I have you know I've some people from IT
66:15 - coming over in about 24 minutes so let
66:21 - me screw up get through some of these
66:22 - questions
66:34 - okay Tafari design says while Visual
66:37 - Studio code is free unbelievable yeah it
66:39 - is it better than sublime our Adam I
66:43 - like Visual Studio code so far at this
66:48 - point I think I like Adam better but
66:50 - that's probably just because of what I
66:54 - have set up in terms of my color scheme
66:57 - and my plugins so assuming I would have
67:01 - the equivalent plug-in set up for Visual
67:04 - Studio code I may like that better I'm
67:06 - not sure I just I haven't had it set up
67:08 - yet so I mean it took me years to get
67:11 - Adam to the point where I have it now
67:13 - with all these different plugins and
67:14 - things so I've only been using Visual
67:18 - Studio code aside from the few times I
67:21 - used it a couple months ago I've only
67:23 - been using it for what seven days this
67:25 - is day seven in this project so maybe
67:29 - I'll get there with it in terms of
67:31 - plugins and then it can be a fair
67:32 - comparison
67:47 - okay so John Hanson has some good
67:50 - information with what I was saying about
67:52 - font weight and how you know this is
67:56 - really clean and easy to read right now
67:59 - on my Mac but if I were to open the same
68:02 - thing on a Windows machine it doesn't
68:06 - always look so clear so John the saying
68:10 - lightweight fonts light color on a dark
68:14 - background generally it's hard to get a
68:16 - clean font he says it's all about
68:19 - Windows running browsers interpolation
68:24 - there are CSS hacks but they don't work
68:26 - in new browsers okay yeah that's been my
68:28 - experience as well I've tried to use
68:29 - some of the CSS hacks before it's kinda
68:33 - it's like anti-aliasing something is the
68:35 - CSS property I can't remember the full
68:37 - thing now I always have to look it up
68:39 - but yeah it doesn't always result in
68:42 - what you want it to hey Sebastian's here
68:48 - hey Sebastian how's it going
68:59 - Sebastian says dotnet looks so messy or
69:01 - at least this code yeah it's probably
69:04 - just this code I don't really know this
69:06 - is the only time I worked with dotnet so
69:08 - I'm not sure but I mean this code is
69:10 - kind of messy I can't say anything about
69:12 - this I copy and pasted most of this into
69:14 - this this part is actually my code but
69:17 - one of the one of the things that's
69:19 - going on that's annoying me right now is
69:20 - this file originally was using tabs and
69:24 - not two spaces for indentation and I'm
69:28 - copying in code that was using two
69:30 - spaces for indentation so my indentation
69:32 - is all messed up and I don't I haven't
69:38 - gone through and fixed it because I've
69:40 - been made lazy by standard J s and
69:44 - prettier formatting all my stuff for me
69:46 - so yes it's definitely a little a bit
69:52 - messy but then even up here like all
69:54 - this stuff I did not do it this was way
69:59 - more CSS and JavaScript than I would
70:01 - ever import into anything
70:10 - Nikki says do you work with Pomodoro
70:14 - sorry I just joined oh don't don't be
70:17 - sorry about that any any questions are
70:20 - welcome yes I do work with Pomodoro so I
70:23 - guess it wasn't visible so I have this
70:25 - is what I use for Pomodoro it's just
70:27 - really basic tomato timer calm you know
70:33 - so I do my normal 25-minute Pomodoro
70:36 - sessions between each we have 5-minute
70:38 - break after four sessions do a 10-minute
70:40 - break so it's it's a really nice way to
70:47 - break up the work I find that that
70:48 - 5-minute break
70:49 - allows me to think about where I'm at in
70:52 - the project what I'm doing otherwise
70:54 - it's easy for me to get stuck on one
70:56 - thing I can keep trying to let's say
70:58 - find a bug in this one place without
71:00 - thinking of the other possibilities that
71:04 - 5-minute break allows me to step back
71:06 - for a second and think one like is this
71:08 - problem even worth all the time that I'm
71:10 - putting into it and then I can decide
71:13 - well maybe not maybe it should be put
71:15 - off until later because it's not really
71:16 - that big of a thing and there are more
71:19 - you know high priority issues to deal
71:21 - with or I could think you know what
71:24 - maybe I should try this other place to
71:27 - look for this bug or something so I
71:28 - really like that aspect of it it's nice
71:31 - you know organization it allows me to
71:33 - see like at the end of the day I can say
71:35 - okay I've done this many Pomodoro
71:36 - sessions that's good for me if I haven't
71:39 - done that many I can think what was I
71:41 - doing and I you know if I look back and
71:43 - say okay well I had three meetings today
71:45 - all right I know what I was doing but if
71:48 - I can look back and say I didn't have
71:49 - any meetings today you know what did I
71:52 - do like I don't know like I was it was I
71:55 - just reading blogs about new frameworks
71:57 - all day or something like so it's kind
71:59 - of like a nice way to keep track of my
72:01 - my productivity as well okay
72:08 - cool yeah if anybody ever wants to know
72:09 - more about the Pomodoro Technique and
72:11 - how I track things so I do use that in
72:14 - conjunction with Trello
72:15 - just kind of give me estimates of my
72:17 - projects I've gone over that before on
72:20 - some of the streams but I'm definitely
72:23 - open to going over it again
72:52 - okay so here's a cool tip so no beers
72:55 - saying with so with Emmet instead of
73:01 - earlier I typed div like this to get a
73:06 - div but he said I can just do what he
73:11 - says I could have just done this and
73:16 - oops wait a second
73:20 - where'd he go just type dot and then
73:28 - it's not working for me maybe I have to
73:32 - change the setting or something but it
73:34 - for right now it is not working maybe if
73:37 - I just add a class like there we go all
73:41 - right cool so nobody here was right I
73:44 - just wasn't doing doing it right so if
73:46 - you just type dot and then put your
73:48 - class names
73:49 - it'll just by default put a div in there
73:51 - really cool thanks okay
74:05 - okay there's some talk about different
74:07 - editors and which ones are free or not
74:09 - that I haven't downloaded at him in a
74:12 - long time it's been on my machines for
74:14 - quite a while maybe like a year a year
74:19 - and a half ago might have been the last
74:20 - time I downloaded at them at that point
74:22 - it was completely free I'm assuming it's
74:23 - still completely free sublime and this
74:29 - is I'm just gonna summarize what was
74:31 - going on here in the live chat for a
74:32 - while it seems like you can use sublime
74:35 - somehow for free but there's a paid
74:39 - version as well I don't know what the
74:41 - difference is between the two it seems
74:44 - like brackets is also paid and Visual
74:50 - Studio code is definitely free although
74:56 - it was said that there seemed to be ways
74:59 - around paying for things I'm not gonna
75:02 - endorse that so that's entirely up to
75:06 - you whether you want to do that but at
75:09 - least officially you do need to pay for
75:13 - brackets and at least some version of
75:17 - sublime safari design asks if I'm
75:26 - recording the whole episode yes so all
75:29 - these streams are recorded and they're
75:31 - available on free code camp just within
75:35 - minutes after the stream ends I put all
75:38 - the videos into one big playlist called
75:40 - live coding with Jesse and then
75:42 - sometimes I split out and I also have
75:45 - videos from each project in their own
75:48 - playlist I don't have a playlist for
75:50 - this project yet but project two does
75:52 - have its own playlist but usually the
75:58 - stream is kind of at the top of the
76:00 - video list since I do streams you know
76:02 - on a ideal week I do it five times a
76:05 - week so it's never really that far down
76:08 - the list you can find one of these
76:10 - strains
76:24 - brian says show her some love I'm
76:26 - assuming that came when I was talking
76:28 - about my wife and and her doctors
76:30 - appointment everything so yeah thanks I
76:33 - mean that's really about all I can do is
76:35 - show some love because I'm not I mean
76:38 - medically it's just like you know
76:40 - there's some things you can do like so
76:41 - like cut out a lot of caffeine and do
76:44 - the physical therapy and things like
76:47 - that you know exercise you know but
76:51 - that's a lot of basic things and I can't
76:53 - I can encourage her but I can't I can't
76:56 - do it for her
76:58 - so hopefully hopefully everything gets
77:04 - back to normal one day so I think I
77:07 - talked about this on a stream awhile ago
77:09 - so I'm not gonna bring it all up again
77:11 - but about last November
77:13 - last October my my youngest daughter was
77:16 - born and my wife had a rupture when the
77:21 - birth happened and it was it was really
77:24 - really lucky that my wife and the baby
77:27 - didn't die but she was sent home from
77:30 - the hospital like the next day or maybe
77:33 - two days later and they never caught
77:34 - that it had ruptured even though there
77:36 - was all this I'm not gonna go into
77:38 - details but there were there was
77:39 - definitely signs that something had
77:41 - happened but they still let her go home
77:43 - and so for like a month we had no idea
77:46 - what's going on but there are all these
77:47 - problems so just to cut to the point she
77:51 - had to have really major surgery we
77:53 - can't have kids anymore and it was very
77:56 - traumatic for her so that's why we're at
77:58 - now almost a year from from when that
78:02 - happened and it's still she's still
78:04 - having medical issues and you know
78:06 - mental health issues so it's just been
78:10 - really hard for you know I think she
78:12 - thought and I thought too that you know
78:14 - she'd be completely you know kind of
78:17 - over this by now and and I think a lot
78:20 - of other people thought that too so it's
78:21 - hard because she's not really getting a
78:23 - lot of understanding or sympathy from
78:25 - people you know that are in the family
78:27 - and around her because they all assume
78:30 - hey well
78:31 - you over this yet so anyway I'm sure
78:35 - it'll be I'm sure it'll work out it's
78:39 - just going to take time
78:48 - let's see safari design says I always
78:53 - feel unmotivated when coding then my
78:56 - motivation spikes all of a sudden out of
78:57 - nowhere so yes it right around the time
79:02 - when I was talking about my wife I was
79:04 - also talking about my lack of motivation
79:06 - today and yes it's a it I don't know my
79:11 - motivation is weird I mentioned I
79:15 - mentioned yesterday I'm not I think it
79:17 - was yes maybe was the day before who
79:19 - knows at some time recently I had
79:21 - mentioned some like stuff about
79:23 - depression and mental health so I'm not
79:25 - gonna redo my whole speech about that
79:28 - but I think a lot of my lack of
79:31 - motivation is is twofold one well aside
79:36 - from everything going on with my wife
79:37 - which I'm sure is is impacting me I
79:40 - really have been super busy and have not
79:43 - even made an attempt to exercise in
79:45 - weeks
79:45 - that's definitely hurting me also I'm on
79:49 - a new antidepressant medication and I'm
79:53 - sure my body is trying to adjust to that
79:55 - and so that's just some days are better
79:59 - than others but right now it's like I
80:01 - just don't want to get out of bed ever
80:03 - so hopefully it'll all be better in four
80:06 - to six weeks that's what they told me so
80:12 - right now caffeine is is helping supply
80:15 - some of the lack of motivation John
80:21 - Hanson says all the best wishes to your
80:22 - wife's recovery thank you I really
80:24 - appreciate that
80:30 - okay John John Hanson clarified so a
80:33 - couple minutes ago I wasn't sure he was
80:35 - referring to some time I said never and
80:37 - I couldn't remember what I said so he
80:39 - clarified and said you said never about
80:42 - needing to go back into the new homepage
80:44 - to edit it yeah you're right I should
80:46 - not say never if I'm lucky I will never
80:49 - have but realistically I'll probably
80:53 - have to at least once when the URL
80:57 - changes for the new student applications
81:01 - for the prospective students to apply so
81:03 - I will well assuming that this version
81:06 - goes live before the application goes
81:07 - live which who knows I don't know I
81:12 - don't really know if we can get this new
81:15 - stuff live before October when I have to
81:18 - switch back to project one for a while I
81:20 - think that would be really ambitious to
81:22 - think that we could get it to the point
81:23 - where it would be good and get approval
81:26 - from everybody that needs to approve it
81:28 - so it really may not be and so closer to
81:31 - I don't know maybe realistically like
81:37 - we're probably talking like December I
81:42 - don't know
81:44 - we'll say I'm hopeful it'll be earlier
81:46 - than that but things tend to move really
81:48 - slowly around here no matter how fast I
81:51 - can build a site like it just seems like
81:54 - for the big sites like this it has to go
81:58 - through a lot of Hoops to get to get
82:00 - approval our Sebastian says last year I
82:07 - had a car accident where I broke my left
82:09 - arm I had to have surgery to fix my bone
82:11 - and now I have five screws my arm I
82:13 - couldn't lift my fingers or hand for
82:15 - almost three months and had no
82:17 - sensitivity now it's almost fully
82:19 - recovered still feeling weird but it's
82:21 - at 99% function functionality I can't
82:24 - lift hard stuff and my sensitivity is
82:26 - not 100% but it's okay all right so
82:29 - that's Wow and so that was a year ago
82:33 - okay well that's I mean I'm sorry that
82:35 - happened to you but I'm really glad that
82:36 - you brought
82:37 - up it's just the idea that I get at
82:42 - least it's somewhat normal today
82:43 - a whole year later not be fully
82:45 - recovered as I like that idea I guess it
82:50 - makes me feel like this is somewhat
82:54 - normal and you know my wife will be okay
82:57 - I think she'll be okay and the doctors
83:02 - think should be okay
83:13 - okay so Tafari design has another
83:15 - question about editors since when
83:18 - working at a company do they allow you
83:20 - to use your own editors on the company
83:22 - computer Roland says depends on the
83:25 - company that's that's exactly what I was
83:28 - thinking as well yeah so it does depend
83:31 - here at the University when I first
83:35 - started working here it was it was
83:39 - difficult to get any anything on my
83:42 - computer at first because so I didn't
83:44 - have admin access to the computer on the
83:47 - IT department did at some point I
83:50 - finally got admin access because I
83:52 - submitted a list of a lot of stuff that
83:54 - I would need for development and at that
83:57 - point I just came in and talked with
83:59 - some of the people from IT and we got on
84:00 - the same page about what I what my
84:03 - development process was like what I
84:05 - needed and kind of like how careful I
84:08 - was gonna be about everything and then I
84:10 - was allowed to have to have access the
84:13 - condition to that was that I don't have
84:15 - I'm not connected like to the main
84:18 - network but in some of the ways that
84:20 - other computers are connected so I was
84:23 - fine with that because I didn't need
84:24 - access to anything but just in case I
84:26 - happen to screw something up which I
84:28 - never have but it's possible that it
84:32 - wouldn't spread it's a lot of other
84:34 - computers so that's um that was that
84:40 - with me so since that point I've been
84:42 - able to use whatever editors I you know
84:45 - I wanted the good thing about like Adam
84:49 - and Visual Studio code is at least on a
84:53 - Mac the download process and
84:55 - installation actually doesn't require
84:56 - you to have an admin password like admin
84:59 - access I think it's probably has
85:01 - something to do with it being electron
85:03 - based because I've noticed that other
85:08 - things that our electron base also do
85:10 - that
85:11 - so anyway technically I guess you could
85:15 - get around it yeah but I have heard of
85:20 - companies where things are really locked
85:24 - down
85:26 - I talked to a guy that's a developer he
85:29 - lives in the same city as me but he
85:32 - actually works up in Pittsburgh and he
85:35 - said like there are some companies that
85:38 - he his agency works for that are even
85:41 - really picky about like what what
85:44 - linters get used in your editor like so
85:49 - it's you know they're picky right down
85:53 - to really my new details in really in
85:58 - situations where it doesn't make sense
85:59 - that they're that picky so I I guess I'm
86:03 - kind of fortunate and that I get a lot
86:05 - of leeway to pick my tools and even
86:07 - you've seen from project to project I
86:09 - like to try out different things so not
86:12 - everybody has it like that
86:29 - john-john pink B says is there way to
86:34 - upload to code pound a previously
86:36 - downloaded code pen zip file I don't I
86:40 - don't know I've never tried to do that I
86:41 - heard about that being done so sorry I
86:44 - really can't give you an answer maybe
86:46 - somebody else with the live chat has had
86:48 - experience with that but yeah I've I
86:53 - really have no idea
87:13 - okay
87:17 - there's a there's still a lot of talk
87:19 - about the the editors so I'm skipping
87:21 - over a lot of the editor discussion
87:23 - since I don't know we've have we have so
87:26 - many discussions about editors I'm just
87:28 - gonna I'm just going to skip
87:39 - okay at some point safari design said
87:41 - that I should split my screen so that we
87:45 - could see the code and the design at the
87:47 - same time I could probably do that but
87:49 - it kind of depends like I when we're
87:56 - when we're looking at like kind of a
87:57 - more narrow screen that's fine but if I
88:01 - want to get a wider view obviously I
88:03 - can't do that so that's why I have
88:04 - normally been flipping back and forth
88:06 - and a lot of times I like to use dev
88:08 - tools so I don't know maybe I could have
88:15 - another desktop view that split and just
88:18 - have that open like as a duplicate and
88:21 - go to that off to think about it because
88:23 - I do see some people in other videos
88:25 - that make that work with the split it's
88:28 - just always seemed to me like I don't
88:29 - have enough space when I'm splitting my
88:31 - screen like that so but I mean I could I
88:34 - could try to give it a shot sometime
88:59 - okay so if somebody I'm so somebody put
89:03 - a message in the live chat that are in
89:05 - other characters other than what I'm
89:08 - used to reading so I'm gonna do a Google
89:11 - Translate really quick to try to get it
89:16 - into something I can't understand and
89:20 - let's see okay so it looks like Mari
89:24 - Sava so let me know if that's wrong but
89:28 - this way I'm getting from Google
89:30 - Translate so Mari Sava says hello Jessi
89:34 - just sitting and watching your video
89:36 - react project to day five I love it so
89:39 - much that I wanted to say hello for a
89:41 - long time and say thank you well you're
89:46 - welcome thank you so much for saying
89:48 - that I really appreciate that that
89:50 - always makes me really happy when when
89:52 - someone appreciates what I'm doing and
89:56 - and get something out of it so thank you
90:00 - thank you again for saying that Mari
90:03 - also says it's 8 p.m. there so have a
90:06 - good evening so maybe more you didn't
90:08 - hear that my response to that maybe
90:11 - maybe later maybe a more you can watch
90:16 - the recording or something but let's see
90:21 - Tafari design says Jessie's code is so
90:23 - neat it makes my mind all fuzzy thinking
90:26 - about freshly Windex glass Thanks I
90:29 - don't I don't it doesn't look that neat
90:32 - to me like honestly this looks a lot
90:34 - more messy than my code normally is but
90:39 - but like I said normally I I have it
90:43 - automatically formatted for me so you
90:46 - can't really I can't really take credit
90:48 - for it before you design says is react
90:54 - hard a lot of companies require that
90:56 - skill nowadays
90:58 - jonbi says hey Jambi hey how's it going
91:01 - only way you'll find out is if you try
91:05 - it see if it's difficult for you or easy
91:07 - you might be surprised go check the
91:09 - react documentation page they have a
91:11 - tutorial for it
91:12 - you
91:12 - yeah definitely I try it out I think
91:14 - when I first tried react I thought it
91:17 - was hard just did I get my mind around
91:21 - the concept and and the terminology and
91:24 - things that was a little bit hard for me
91:26 - but I watched videos of people doing it
91:30 - and did some tutorials and then little
91:31 - by little I got used to it
91:33 - that's probably different you know for
91:35 - different people depending on your your
91:37 - experiences before trying to learn
91:39 - reacts for me it was a little bit of a
91:43 - challenge but now that I'm using reacts
91:46 - I think I actually think it's really
91:49 - easy to do you know do things and react
91:52 - and I mean I've we've done just on this
91:54 - dream alone you know we've used several
91:57 - different things we've done server-side
92:00 - rendered react we've pulled in data from
92:03 - api's we've done we've used create react
92:08 - react app and with react router so we've
92:11 - done a lot of cool stuff on a project
92:13 - I'm doing right now for for a course on
92:16 - the side I'm using redux I'm starting to
92:20 - learn react native and they all seem
92:22 - really cool I mean I'm not gonna lie
92:23 - Redux is probably the most challenging
92:25 - thing so far for me but still I'm you
92:30 - know I've only been exposed to it for
92:32 - you know weeks yeah maybe like a month
92:35 - it made probably over a month now but I
92:37 - really haven't been able to dedicate
92:40 - consistent time every day to it if I had
92:44 - maybe I'd understand it a bit more right
92:46 - now but even even with all that I think
92:48 - I have a good grasp of things at this
92:50 - point and I mean it hasn't really taken
92:52 - that long so I say give react a shot
93:10 - okay lost my place no Peter says Jessie
93:20 - check the the right search input when I
93:22 - clicked it it redirects the search page
93:24 - yeah right now it does that so it
93:27 - shouldn't do that I'm not sure what the
93:29 - problem is so I am gonna have to check
93:32 - that yeah cuz on the demo site it
93:41 - doesn't do that so I'll figure it out
93:44 - I'll get that working
93:55 - nobody is said to try footer copyright
93:58 - margin top 20 pixels okay I'll have to
94:01 - give that a shot later on safari design
94:12 - asks if I'm a freelance web developer no
94:18 - well I mean I do some freelance work on
94:20 - the side but my full-time job as a web
94:23 - developer is at a university
94:37 - I John Hanson said break the lines out
94:40 - of their container it's easier and use
94:43 - flex and no need for media queries okay
94:46 - so I'll have to mess around with flex
94:47 - with these and see if I can get that
94:50 - working
95:12 - okay Sebastian says in Visual Studio
95:15 - code the bottom blue bar if you click
95:19 - spaces cool and then using spaces yeah
95:30 - too
95:36 - okay so I have two now so it's not did
95:41 - it automatically do anything I can't
95:43 - even tell him that oh cool it looks like
95:49 - maybe you do so that's definitely two
95:52 - spaces now cool yeah that looks like it
96:00 - did automatically change everything all
96:03 - right
96:04 - all right Sebastian thank you that like
96:08 - it looks so much better to me now
96:10 - awesome
96:28 - that's how a design said Jessie don't
96:31 - tell everyone all your business we
96:32 - respect your privacy but also said I
96:36 - also wish all the best for your wife as
96:40 - well thank you I appreciate that yeah I
96:44 - know I don't have to tell my business
96:46 - but I don't know sometimes I feel like
96:51 - if I talk about things it helps me but
96:54 - it also helps anybody else that may be
96:56 - going through something similar so you
97:00 - know it's alright I don't mind talking
97:03 - about that stuff I'm just worried that
97:05 - you all don't wouldn't want to hear that
97:08 - like you want to hear the code stuff so
97:09 - I'm worried that I go on too long about
97:11 - it so but otherwise you know I don't I
97:15 - don't mind talking about that stuff and
97:18 - you know especially to like about the
97:24 - depression stuff I really don't mind
97:26 - talking about that at all because I
97:27 - think I think people need to talk about
97:31 - that more and not be ashamed of it you
97:36 - know like you know you get if you break
97:40 - your leg you break your leg it's fine
97:43 - everybody knows you break your leg and
97:45 - they realize you know you're gonna walk
97:46 - slow for a while right you might have a
97:48 - wheelchair crutches right so if you have
97:50 - depression it's gonna impact your life
97:52 - and how how you can do things but if we
97:56 - never talk about it you know people
97:59 - aren't going to know people are going to
98:01 - realize that that that's a legitimate
98:03 - thing and it definitely impacts
98:06 - someone's ability to do things just like
98:08 - a broken leg would impact it I mean not
98:10 - not just like but in a similar way as a
98:14 - broken leg would impact physically how
98:16 - you can walk you know depression would
98:19 - impact mentally how you can interact
98:21 - with the world do your job do I mean so
98:24 - I don't know so I I think as long as we
98:28 - don't I like the idea of being open with
98:30 - it I don't like the idea that if you're
98:32 - open with it you know you could be
98:33 - discriminated against for jobs and
98:35 - things like that as long as that doesn't
98:38 - happen I'm all for people knowing just
98:41 - more about it in general and I think we
98:44 - could benefit so for me right now I'm
98:47 - not gonna lose my job if I have
98:49 - depression so I'm in a position where I
98:51 - think I can talk about it you know to
98:53 - other people and have it you know on
98:55 - YouTube so so I am so I'm going to talk
98:58 - about it
98:59 - not all the time occasionally you know
99:02 - and hopefully that couldn't help but I
99:04 - mean this thing is mainly about code so
99:06 - it's it's always gonna be at least like
99:08 - 90% about code if not more nobody said
99:15 - oh that's so sad to hear about your wife
99:18 - thank thank you I appreciate you saying
99:20 - that Sebastian says I'm so sorry about
99:22 - your wife hope she gets well soon
99:24 - Sampson says same I appreciate
99:28 - appreciate y'all Rohan says best wishes
99:30 - for your family I really appreciate I
99:33 - think thank you all I'll definitely let
99:35 - my my wife know that you are we're
99:39 - wishing her the best and everything
99:47 - oh cool so Mari Sava was the right the
99:54 - right translation of that so awesome
100:03 - marisol this is Jesse you made my day
100:06 - awesome I'm glad I'm glad that I could
100:09 - do that I hide a B Shaykh says is is it
100:20 - better than brackets for web development
100:22 - so it's Visual Studio code better than
100:26 - brackets I've never used brackets so I
100:30 - can't say for sure but so far I like
100:32 - Visual Studio code okay John B says on
100:42 - the subject of being worried about space
100:44 - with Visual Studio code you can toggle
100:46 - word wrap with the option key and and Z
100:50 - or on Windows the Alt key and Z let's
100:52 - actually let's do that right now so I
100:53 - don't forget so options cool I you know
101:00 - what until you said that I didn't even
101:02 - realize that I did not have word wrap on
101:05 - because I've had it on by default and
101:08 - Adam for so long that it didn't even
101:11 - occur to me and that's a lot nicer not
101:14 - thank you I'm learning a lot of cool
101:17 - stuff about Visual Studio code I'm glad
101:20 - I decided to use this for the stream
101:36 - okay all right well I'm going to wrap
101:38 - the stream up because the people are
101:41 - here from IT check things out so thank
101:43 - you so much for watching and I'll be
101:45 - back tomorrow have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're going to finish up this footer I took the morning off to watch my kids when my wife had a doctor's appointment so I haven't done much but I had one really good idea at least it seems good now I only had it five minutes ago so we'll see we kept having some conflicts with the Styles yesterday when we were working on this footer so I I thought why are we even keeping the old styles we took everything off of this page so we don't need any of them so I went in went to the top of our main master template here and I commented out all this ESS and when I did that it changed to the footer Abed all of this stayed the same which which is good it should have but down here in the footer I have a little little difference here if you remember we had a different font and we had a shadow on it before and we had some you know buttons this was stabbed more like a button all these links so now this is using the materialized Styles still needs a little bit of work but now we won't have to fight with all those with all the styles that are there now what this does mean is that we're not going to be able to keep any of the elements that we're there like intact as is which is okay with me you know they're they all needed to be redone anyway but I think this will make things a lot easier for us it'll be pretty straightforward now when we try to do something with with materialized it should work and all we have to worry about is just any customizations that we need to make on top of materia so today I'd like to get this looking exactly the way that we want to we want it to look I'm thinking two Pomodoro sessions so two 25minute sessions of code in between we'll do our five minutes of questionandanswer and then we'll finish up with some question and answer it should be about an hour and a half assuming we get the normal number of questions and during that time what I'd like to accomplish is getting these headers to all be the same and I'd like everything to be aligned to the right these need to be buttons according to basically this well either you know what you know what I like better on on a dark background like this I actually like what I call the inverted button so I probably didn't make that up I'm sure I got it at some point from somewhere but I I don't remember where I got that term from so basically you if you don't understand you'll see when we do it but it's going to be just a white outline of a button and you'll be able to see the green behind it so we're gonna do those buttons we're gonna fix this so that it looks a little bit nicer and then we'll doublecheck on a few screen sizes how everything stacks up that's not okay yeah so that's not too much but it's going to be nice especially for for those of you who maybe are just getting into things with CSS and aren't super confident with doing things with CSS or maybe just working with materialise so I would say at a level of difficulty this one's going to be like down at like a 1 or 2 you know it's going to be a really beginner friendly stream but if you're not a beginner you know please stick around because we're still you know can get into some more in depth in the question and answer sessions and there's always people asking questions that are you know unrelated to what we happen to be doing in this particular stream so I see in just a few people in the live chat so hey how's it going thanks for joining us so I did schedule this stream a little bit later than normal so we have not quite as many viewers as we normally do at this point but that's probably my fault okay John John Hanson says he's getting an echo is anybody else getting an echo let me know it'll be a few seconds because of the delay but it shouldn't be okay I was double checking to make sure that my voice wasn't playing over any speakers here I don't hear anything okay awesome so we'll get started a few I switched back to my main camera so so far I've had no problems with this main camera because I I had to restart my Mac because it froze yesterday right when I was about to leave it froze so I just shut it down and got to it today when I got into the office but the good thing is since I had to restart everything anyway I updated Visual Studio code I updated Adam I updated about 10 packages in Adam so I did a lot of updates that I had been putting off so I guess that's ended up being good and the camera works now so I have my second camera ready to go so I actually have it over on the side sheets help bring it in to the shot but in case this one freezes I'll just bring the other one in and we won't have to mess with it throughout the throughout the stream okay so now we got a little bit more activity here in the live chat I see Umberto's here Hey umberto I got your your direct message on Twitter for a day or two ago I'm sorry I didn't respond to that I checked it and then I didn't have time to respond and then I forgot about it but I just remembered it now when I saw you so sorry about not responding but I did get it so I don't want you to think I'm ignoring you okay let me set my timer we're gonna do 25 minutes of code all right so first thing I think I want to do is get these headers looking you know kind of uniform right now this is an h5 and these are h2s so these are being pulled in from the content management system and we hardcoded this and what I think we ought to do especially now that I see everything without any styles yet you know from with the old styles I think I'd like to just hard code these as well I I don't think that these things change very often I know we talked about this yesterday of things that don't change often and I mean like aren't likely to change more than once a year I don't really have a problem hard coding them because that's not it's not really a big deal for me once a year to go in and change a line or two hopefully this entire site is redone in a year so I may never have to come back in and change anything but I don't want this to be an h2 I don't want these to be as they are I want them to have the proper classes to make them materialize buttons we will have to so they don't have that inverted button style and materialize by default at least they didn't the last time I checked there yet they are always adding new things so it's possible I missed it but I do have some Styles that I've made you know in addition to the materialized styles that work with materialized so it's just kind of a little addon that I use personally in my project so we'll just have to find that from a previous project and put that in but we're gonna we're going to redo this I think that'll just make things a lot easier once we get that done then we'll work on this down here all right so let's go down the bottom I think actually we should be able to get rid of a lot of this JavaScript now so I'm thinking it's fancy yeah I'm just gonna comment this out right now I will see if we get any errors but there shouldn't be anything on the page that requires this dis JavaScript as we start adding in more elements we might find that we're pulling in something from a template that that does need that and then we'll decide what to do same way we have wait a bit here for for YouTube I don't know that we'll need that I'm not going to go through that now you know we're focusing on the footer right now but we should be able it looks like we should be able to cut down the length of this file significantly so even though we're adding in some hard coded things that we'll add to the length I think we'll be able to cut out enough that it should at least even out hopefully be a bit shorter than it originally was and if it comes down to it we can always separate these things out into their own components if it gets too large so we're looking at these two columns here so this is our Center column and then here we have our our last our right column so let's get rid of these and I think we will need to we will need to go into our CS file so our C sharp file and get rid of some some things some lines in there or else just going to throw an error so let's find that you know like building a folder okay let me let me grab this folder so I see so I'm trying to find this folder and I'm assuming I could just drag it over here I think I can write not see if I can just drag it here whoa okay cool I don't need these this this okay all right so we need to find find where we were there we go master pages so this is what I was looking for oops alright I got a call I gotta take this call so I'm gonna mute my mic and take this you all right sorry about that that was a great time for the normal disclaimer this show is just me doing my normal work as a frontend developer I'm employed at a small university full time so occasionally I do get a knock at the door or a phone call that I need to take so the goal is just to show you what my work day is like and maybe if you're interested in frontend development or you like me pretty much work on your own as a developer and don't know what it's like for other developers I thought this might be kind of helpful to see me doing my thing making mistakes trying to work through it so that's why you know we have interruptions like that and you know I don't mind when it happens I don't like if it's a really long interruption I don't want to waste your time but that one actually was somewhat related to what we're doing so evidently someone is has a link to some page on the main website that from what is described these are the words of the person on the phone not mine that it it works but it doesn't so I don't know what that means but two two guys from the IT department are gonna stop by my office in about an hour and 15 minutes and they said they think it'll be easier if they could just show me which is cool I don't even have to go anywhere so I'm fine with that but anyway I don't mind helping out with stuff like that actually currently right now I'm the only person that knows any web development that has access to these files so I probably am the right person to go to for that in a few weeks though there will be somebody else here working fulltime that will have access so it won't all be on me okay so let's I just so Philips just said in the live chat can we do bad lipsyncing while you're on the phone I'd have been hilarious yeah so I early on when I was streaming there are a few times when I get calls and I just talked and everyone can hear what I was saying and then somebody I can't remember who it was but somebody in a live chat was like you really need to mute your mic in case like something is said that shouldn't be said on you know on YouTube for everyone to hear and so that was a good idea so now I am ute when I when I can when I when I remember it because occasionally that happens it's not like big secret things but sometimes since some of the marketing department sometimes we get information before it's released to the public so that we can prepare how we want to say things you know get things ready so occasionally I might know about something before everyone else is supposed to know about it so so I'm not trying to keep you all out of my business you know otherwise I wouldn't really care but that's better safe than sorry with that kind of thing anyway back to the code so we use that that footer so that mid content and right content and we're just going to get rid of all references to those in here as I said earlier otherwise we'll get an error because it's going to be looking for those elements and it's not gonna find them so now we've removed them from this csharp file and we'll save that and did we say if I'm not sure if we actually saved this file so we may have to get rid of them again okay it did save awesome so I'm gonna refresh we should see nothing in these columns now and we should get no errors okay awesome great so now what we need to do is set up so we have our column in here and we need to do an H 5 mu nu H 5 great yesterday I had complained that it wasn't Auto completing my my tags my HTML tags and you all had charlie who it was sorry I can't remember who it was that old that said that Emmet is available by default and vs code but whoever was that was awesome so thank you really sorry I can't remember who that was not I'm usually pretty good about that but anyway when I did the update one of the things that said that was in the new update was it completed HTML tags now by default so I was happy about that so let's bring up actually I'm gonna do this on the other screen I'm gonna scroll down here just to see what was in here was supposed to be in here I'm gonna pull that to my other screen so I can copy and paste it easily and then we'll we'll build this out to match that that first column that we had made up here whoa do we want that to be all caps I don't think we want that to be all Cavs we'll see we'll see how it looks but I'm just not sure that I want that much text to be capitalized I kept waiting for the auto refresh I'm just so used to that in my other four objects whoa that's weird I thought we had okay I had added these classes on to this let's see if I really want this I'm gonna add these classes as well but now that I look at it I'm not sure that I want this so the light class is gonna make the font weight smaller so I think it makes it about 400 font weight and then if you add the thin class that makes it 300 we can double check that for sure but I'm pretty sure that's what it is and that's just built builtin to materialise let's see how that looks so I found that okay not bad so I found that I like how the the light and sometimes even the thin font looks but only on my Mac so I have nice screens and it looks good when I try to look at it on an older screen on a Windows computer it looks terrible and you can barely read the text so I just I have to always remember that that before I commit to a font weight I need to check it on older screens especially for I mean really for any site but if it's an internal site I know for sure what kind of screens most people are going to be using because there's pretty much a standard Windows computer we have like lenovo's with the standard sized screen and resolution that I would say like 90% of the people here use so I can be pretty sure of what they're gonna see so we'll see we'll just make sure we doublecheck that at some point I'm not sure why we're getting why are we getting that space oh okay I had forgotten we actually have an image that's going to show up here I just haven't we don't have the right source so see we have this image we don't have the right source for it yet so we'll just have to get this in here so that explains the difference the difference here which yeah we'll see you'll see I don't know that we actually need another logo down here now that I look at it because we have this sticky header we're always gonna have a logo visible yeah actually let's take this out you know that's one less image that needs to load on the page and I think it'd be an unnecessary image so if we can remove it then great alright awesome okay we're just going to put in just a regular paragraph tag and then we'll get to those buttons the buttons will be kind of fun just to see how we can adjust what comes with materialise and just kind of make our own variation on it so let me copy the text here oops I need to remember how did we do this with Emmet there we go I need to remember to start using Emmet because I think it'll be a lot faster than what I'm used to okay I just checked no beer said that says I think it's John B is the one who told you that visual studio code I met by default I think you're right I think it was John B I actually I remember it now because I remember saying that John B like officially had the the tip of the day like the best best comment in there something like that for telling me that so anyway I don't I don't see John B in here so might not be watching but if you catch the replay thanks again John B sorry I forgot that it was you but thank you because that that is gonna save me so much time I'm sure once I get the hang of it okay let's see and I want to change so this should not be two hyphens obviously that needs to be an M so I'm gonna look I'm gonna look up the code for that let's see okay so we'll replace this with an M and you'll see I'll show you the difference in case you're not sure what's what's going on so all right so I'm gonna zoom in otherwise it's not really gonna be obvious and I'll pull this over as well so if you you can see on this one we have two hyphens and there's click it's clearly to life as you can see the space in between it right here we have a real all right so that's what we're supposed to have here so this was probably maybe copy and pasted from somewhere or entered into a WYSIWYG editor and it was probably if it was copy and pasted let's say like from a Word document sometimes if you put two hyphens next to each other depending on the editor it'll automatically switch it to this so I'm assuming that that's something like what happened and when it got copy and pasted it it stayed is the two hyphens I don't know but anyway when we see something like that will definitely replace it with the HTML code for that and then one will make sure you know they don't it'll render properly okay let's get rid of this Center right so you don't want that and we don't want the center here either and may as well just put in the next the next part here and I'm just gonna copy this paste it and then I'll bring in the rest and probably about out of time for this Pomodoro session so if you got if you're asking any questions I will get to them in just a few minutes and now that we have this in this just at least give us a nice idea of how this is going to look still don't have the buttons and yet but you know we'll get to that I may as well try to add them in here until I hear the the timer go off let's see okay let me do this image though right is it button BTN nah now I can't remember what it is all right let's try it like I can't remember it if I spell out button or if it's BTN so we're about to find out okay cool that was it alright so here's the default style we're gonna go ahead and I'm gonna make put another button in here and then put the button in there and then we'll change the styles to do that inverted button that I was telling you all about at the beginning of the stream so this should give us all the buttons we want there we go great okay obviously they're not all gonna say apply this will say donate this will say visit right now it says visit campus but I I personally prefer shorter button text so I'll just put it as apply and visit and then this will be I'll keep this as donate it says support Franciscan in the button right now which i think is just way too much text for a button so we'll see I'm sure that my boss will let me know if that's if I'm allowed to do that or not at some point but get a minute okay about two minutes left so we can at least start looking for the code that I need for this so like where did I have the inverted button okay you know what we did the inverted button on project one so I just need to look at I had project one all the code open and Adam earlier today and I thought hey I'm not gonna need this anymore right and so I closed it out and here I do need it again so let's just go to github and grab that code and I'll shoot I'm still my incognito window let me go on a window where I'm still logged in and I'll be easier to find it okay see I react yep that's what we want let's see if we can search great okay so here's our button inverted styles so let's grab these and I'm being able to search your entire repository for stuff when github is just amazing like it just it's so fast okay yeah we'll just grab this and this should be yeah it should be fun and let's need to bring up our CSS so for now I'm just gonna save this and I'm gonna apply this button inverted class and see what that actually we're gonna see what that does first thing whenever we get done questionanswer so for right now I'm gonna scroll up in the live chat up to the top and just go down through and get through as many questions and comments as I can then we'll do another 25 minute session of code and it looks like we're gonna be able to get this finished in within one more 25minute session which is great okay so John Hanson said at the beginning of stream that he was getting an echo turns out there were two YouTube windows running at the same time so alright problem solves I'm glad I'm glad it wasn't some issue on my end because I don't really know that much about the audio or the like audio video end of streaming so if it was a problem on my end I would have had the a lot of research no beer says hi Jessie how are you not bad I mean honestly I have a serious lack of motivation today but other than that not too bad I had some bad news about my wife from the doctor this morning so that's kind of a downer but I think everything's gonna be all right she's gonna have to do some physical therapy for a while but the doctor thinks that she'll she'll recover so it's really crazy that she had major surgery a year ago and this is still related to that surgery she's still trying to get over so I feel really bad for that actually the doctor told her she thinks she has posttraumatic stress disorder from what happened and that like that is actually causing pain for her in addition to the physical problems so that's really stinks I just I can't do anything you know I can't I can't help her so oh I know that was a lot of info sorry usually when people ask how you're doing they're expecting like oh I'm doing alright how you going but anyway so that's how I'm doing right now the stream always gets me going like even if the whole rest of the day I just don't feel like doing anything once once the stream starts and I start talking to you all like at least for that time period I feel motivated to do something so thank you all for that for that motivation and I can usually keep the motivation going for a little while afterwards so at least if I stream I get something done that day something productive done okay John Hanson at some point says never never say never when did I say now I can't remember if I said never about something let me know what I said never about because I cannot remember at all what I was talking about them gold asks what editor are you using I'm sure you got a response to that one yeah definitely so it is Visual Studio code let me flip over to that Visio code so for the first two projects I used Adam switch to visual studio code for this project mostly because when I months ago when I initially started working a little bit with this project things didn't display right the syntax highlighting didn't really work well with the csharp files and I had been meaning to try out Visual Studio code anyway so I thought hey let's just try that I just assumed Visual Studio code would probably handle it better and it did so I I just started using it so I think it's cool to show different different editors as well because we always have discussions about what editor is the best so this would be a nice comparison you know that way if you haven't tried it out yet you at least get to see it see what it's like and see the differences okay so rook asks that's cool this person's name and the live chat is rook and then their their avatar is actually a rook from from like the Chesky the chess piece of rook so anyway that's cool my son and I played chess and occasionally so I enjoy a good game of chess every now and then but anyway the question is I saw in a previous video test being done when pushing to github what does that there's a lot of things you could do that that do that in that particular project I'm using something called nightmare and if you check if you check out that project so in that video there'll be a link to the github repo so if you check out the pull request where we added testing so turn that Kevin added that in pretty early on so check out some of the early pool requests and specifically it'll say like testing in in the title of it I can't remember offhand what the the PR number is but Kevin went through a really nice thorough explanation of what kind of testing was being done how it was being done and even some of the other types of testing that we could be doing as well so that explanation is going to be a much better answer than anything I could give you right now in the stream so I would check that out for sure if you're if you're interested in more and how you know how we're doing that alright so my timer did go off let me write down where I left off at okay and let's go set this timer again alright so we've already brought in the CSS that we need for these buttons I probably brought in more than I needed but yeah I don't know that I need this this gives us maybe we do I think we do I think this is the one we want I think we want the button inverted white this one will give us a black border I don't want a black border on the green if we were going on on a white background this would be okay I don't know what ended up happening here but it seems like I named these differently than I would normally do in a project probably at some point I needed to change him and I didn't bother changing the class name because I don't think this is really what yeah this isn't what I wanted what I normally mean by an inverted button so I'll tell you what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take this out and I'm gonna put in instead I'm gonna take out this white and this should be what we want I think I can doublecheck that actually I you know what I made a mistake this would have worked these are actually the same thing it's just one as a white border when it's a black border in any case we want the white water one for here I don't think we'll have any need for the black border one so my mistake there at the with that first one I just I I happen to look at the color variable instead of the background color and that messed me up anyway let's just add in class we may not even need but enlarge down here so we'll get rid of that yeah there we go I think we'll get rid of this button large class because I don't want really giant buttons down there I want them to be kind of slim and we'll just put in now I can't remember what it was but inverted okay and let's see what we get it should be a white outline and white text there we go great alright so now we have these when you hover it just fills it up with white okay not bad I think it's it's kind of like more sleek then let's say if we had this this you know very bright color here and I would still say you know in certain circumstances we might want to do that but I don't like having this bright color if we have lots of buttons so we have two buttons right next to each other than a third one not that far away I think it's overwhelming the accent color which is basically what this is the the accent color and I mean this is my opinion here but the accent color is only effective if you use it sparingly it's supposed to draw the eye because it's different and it's vibrant if you use it too much it no longer draws the eye because the eyes used to seeing it right so you you lose whatever benefit that you had from that accent color so if you see right now on the page it's used once the only time you see that color at all is here at this call to action so that's that's how I like to use it now not to say you couldn't use it anywhere else on the page certainly you know as we scroll down this won't be in view anymore you could probably use it somewhere else without really losing the effect but in general I tried not to use it too often on a page okay probably one let's let's put in the correct text in here and just kind of see how it lines up and I may want a little bit of space between these two buttons they're kind of close together otherwise it doesn't look too bad or you know essentially it looks how I wanted it to look so whether or not that looks bad I don't know but we I got down what I wanted to so we're gonna have which one this was apply visit and donates and if we can so I don't want to remove this right now but I think I do want to talk about removing this with my boss because we're gonna have this donate button visible here all the time so we may be able to get rid of this and then put something else useful in here instead of repeating donate or just leave it out all together and we could have just two columns yeah I mean I think well I'm certain that there's something else useful that could go here we don't necessarily need this yeah let's put in let's put in a little bit of padding and bring we use dev tools for this just so that we can see beforehand without having to do a bunch of refreshes what we want to do so let's see I'll do I'm sorry margin left I said padding but I'm we're gonna do margin let's just adding eight pixels I like that let's see eight pixels looks good to me okay so we're gonna add in eight pixels I'm just gonna do this inline yeah I'm just gonna do it inline if I find that I'm using this same kind of pattern a lot then maybe I'll do something else with it maybe I could make it class I don't know I'll figure something out if that happens but I'm not gonna do it right now I think it would be overkill so let's say style and I'm gonna have to remember not to do it the react way have been been in react land for too long and now it it's affecting my basic HTML skills so what do we say margin left and eight pixels it was it was just so hard for me not to put curly brackets in camelcase that and to put comments around that lets verify that I did that right okay great not bad I think this this font size is just way too small I want to doublecheck and see what size that actually is ooh 10 font size 15 that really man maybe it's just the resolution on my monitor but that looks really small like definitely not 15 I want to see where that's being pulled in I I kind of like having the baseline font size at at least 16 pixels see what that how much of a difference that would make not a lot just a slight difference here for most of the text the interior text in this section we're going to use that materialize that responsive font class that they have but I think the footer can be a smaller smaller font size all right I'm gonna leave that for now I don't have to think about the best way to handle this you know because the fonts being set at several different screen sizes let's just try it out right now I think I'm a let's see I just don't want to override too much so let's see what what happens if we do HTML font size 16 pixels we'll save that and let's see what it does and what I want to do is shrink this down and see if it if we're gonna don't write everything and is it gonna look too big on a smaller screen okay and then finally I want to test to see what this does is float X so this is that responsive font okay wonderful all right so that's perfect that's gonna work for us we're basically resetting so that we're at minimum were always having at least a 16 pixel font size but it's not messing up our responsive font so that's good some time with that okay now let's see what else we need whoa I don't like that oh I see what it's like that you know what let's take instead of having a left margin on this second one let's put the margin a right margin on this one so when it gets to when it stacks we don't have this weirdness going on and also we need some we need a margin between these as well so let's just move this off of here put it here and we'll change this from left to right and then while we're in here let's add actually let's just take this off completely let's add a margin of zero right eight pixels bottom eight pixels and then left zero pixels I'm really glad that we decided to do the footer now because otherwise we may have to be like scrolling down a lot to see it it's nice that the page is short here so there's not a whole lot of you know we don't really have to scroll a lot okay that looks nice let's make sure it still looks nice here aha is it no okay okay that's popping that up so I don't think the best thing to do is just to add add a bottom margin here that's just a simplest way to solve this for now so I think at least for me and this is my viewpoint on things if I'm coming into a system like an old system and trying to make things better and it's probably not even going to be around that much longer then I'm of the opinion that it's no it's a waste of time trying to make things in terms of how you're organizing your code and all that try to make things like really like you would if it was a from scratch project so a lot of things reusable and easy for other people to understand right like this is just a patch up job you know to to last us maybe another year until we can have another site so I have very limited time to work on this just until October and then I don't know when I'm going to get another chance to work on it so since we're just trying to get as much as we possibly can done that's why I do I'll do stuff like this right just some inline Styles here because this was the fastest way to solve this problem in a very straightforward way I'm not I'm not really worried about whether or not this is necessarily the technically best way to do it or you know organizationally the best way to do it so another disclaimer there's a good disclaimer these are not tutorials this is not hey I'm doing it the best way possible this is I have various jobs and projects to do with different deadlines this is how I'm getting my stuff done these are the compromises that have to be made because a lot of tutorials are trying to show like this is the best way to do it which is wonderful and I love those tutorials but I thought what was maybe lacking in in terms of videos was videos of someone saying I know this is probably not the best way to do it but here's our deadline and here's all the stuff we have to do so this is what we're going to do now and if we end up getting done early we can always come back and fix it but for right now we need to work because it's been my experience over the last like five years or so projects is that clients just don't always have the money for you to do things the absolutely perfect way and you have to make a decision do I want to just turn down the product the the client do I want to get this finished do I want to you know how do you want to do things right I mean you I don't think it's it's unique to what we do you know I'm sure they're you know when you hire a contractor to work on your house you know he'd love to be able to put in you know granite and marble and you know really nice topoftheline everything and that would look amazing we look great in in their portfolio right but not everybody has the money or the time for that so I think it's the same way with us right it'd be great if we could work on projects and do everything how we would want to do it you know completely you know cutting edge doing everything right but that's just not the reality so hopefully this shows a little bit of my reality of how I need to work so I know my other people might have you know different opinions about that but I don't know I'm just practical about it I don't want you anybody to feel bad for just doing the job you know getting things done so long as it works I you know I do want to say I'm not saying cut corners and make something that's not a good product I'm saying just get things done without worrying about little tiny details in terms of code organization I'll stress over tiny details in the UI all day right because that's the user will see that all right but if I had to choose between stressing every UI details or stretching over the organization of my CSS I'm gonna choose the CSS that's user facing the odds of another developer ever even editing this code aside from me are probably less than 1% right now so I'm not worrying about it anyway so I've been sorry for me going off on that but just wanted to kind of explain my viewpoint on that okay so what do we need to do now I got all offtrack this we need to get this in a better spot basically what I want this to I want it to be over here on this side and then we need to figure out what its gonna do when we go to a smaller screen I don't want it to do this kind of stuff I'd rather have it be probably on top of this copyright so let's give this a shot I think I'm gonna structure this differently so right now we just we have this so we have this on s12 right so it does stack eventually let's let's change first of all I want to change this just to see what it'll look like just with this kind of minor change so we're gonna switch it up and on medium screens we're gonna go full width to twelve columns and then on large we're gonna split it up let's see how much space that gives us to work with now okay all right not bad I mean obviously I want it reversed but okay so we're at that point I mean all right here's our two options I think we can either make it so that they basically just always stacked except on extra large screens or we can extend these out of their container so that we give them some more space you know in particular like here you know let's say we gave extending them out here and gave them just like 16 pixel margin on both sides that would probably be enough space I think I like the first option so let's try that I want to make sure I think that materialized did end up adding in an extra class like an Excel class let's see if it works so we're gonna go large and then X I think that's how they implemented it for a while they didn't have an extra large class and we you had to just make it yourself and then it finally got in to a pool request okay that Excel is what 1200 pixels when is that kick in I think it's yeah so we're still getting you know some of this going on that certain screen widths um I guess I'm okay with that okay yeah I think I'm okay with that but what I need to do though is we need to be able to flip these around so to do that I want to check out I made a class for an earlier project that allowed the easily allowed you without having to create a lot of extra markup to flip at certain screen sizes to flip the order around so I want to check that out first to see if we can apply that here it's been a while since I've used it but it could save us a little bit of time so we're going to go back to github and I'm gonna go to I think I showed you this project yesterday and I don't think it's in the u.s. markup I think it's it's long before we we made this organization it is so it'll be on my my repo profile there we go it'll be on my profile Franciscan Square okay so in the franciscan square site I think I had this wow this is bigger than I thought it would be uhhuh that's why I didn't search I thought I could just scroll through and find it hold on I think I remember what I called it order there we go okay so okay that's what I did so I think I use flex is that my timer Wow the timer went off okay so the only thing that I'm really gonna change I don't want it is completely finish but we're really close the only thing I wanted to change now well there are basically two things I want to make sure that these are kind of on the same line I'm not sure why they're not right now I'll just have to check in dev tools and see I probably have some sort of padding on this or something so I'm going to check that out get these on the same line and then what I'll probably do is just implement some some form of this so what I need to find is where exactly I'm using flex here so I'll just open this site up in dev tools I'll check out one of the one of the columns that I'm using this on and just see what's what's being applied to the parent containers and that should tell me everything that I need to know about that and then basically what will happen is the order property here will flip so that on large screens no no I'm sorry on small screens so this meeting you queries hang on small screens if it has the class of order one the order will be one that has the class of order the order will be so what I'll be able to do then is put and I guess I could put it on here now and then I'll just copy a copy over everything so so what one is this actually needs to be ordered to you want this to come second and that needs to be order one so even though this should always be one based on the markup what will happen is on a small screen they'll flip flop so that this one will be above that one okay now let's let me check the time okay yeah I definitely want to go to do some questions now I have you know I've some people from IT coming over in about 24 minutes so let me screw up get through some of these questions okay Tafari design says while Visual Studio code is free unbelievable yeah it is it better than sublime our Adam I like Visual Studio code so far at this point I think I like Adam better but that's probably just because of what I have set up in terms of my color scheme and my plugins so assuming I would have the equivalent plugin set up for Visual Studio code I may like that better I'm not sure I just I haven't had it set up yet so I mean it took me years to get Adam to the point where I have it now with all these different plugins and things so I've only been using Visual Studio code aside from the few times I used it a couple months ago I've only been using it for what seven days this is day seven in this project so maybe I'll get there with it in terms of plugins and then it can be a fair comparison okay so John Hanson has some good information with what I was saying about font weight and how you know this is really clean and easy to read right now on my Mac but if I were to open the same thing on a Windows machine it doesn't always look so clear so John the saying lightweight fonts light color on a dark background generally it's hard to get a clean font he says it's all about Windows running browsers interpolation there are CSS hacks but they don't work in new browsers okay yeah that's been my experience as well I've tried to use some of the CSS hacks before it's kinda it's like antialiasing something is the CSS property I can't remember the full thing now I always have to look it up but yeah it doesn't always result in what you want it to hey Sebastian's here hey Sebastian how's it going Sebastian says dotnet looks so messy or at least this code yeah it's probably just this code I don't really know this is the only time I worked with dotnet so I'm not sure but I mean this code is kind of messy I can't say anything about this I copy and pasted most of this into this this part is actually my code but one of the one of the things that's going on that's annoying me right now is this file originally was using tabs and not two spaces for indentation and I'm copying in code that was using two spaces for indentation so my indentation is all messed up and I don't I haven't gone through and fixed it because I've been made lazy by standard J s and prettier formatting all my stuff for me so yes it's definitely a little a bit messy but then even up here like all this stuff I did not do it this was way more CSS and JavaScript than I would ever import into anything Nikki says do you work with Pomodoro sorry I just joined oh don't don't be sorry about that any any questions are welcome yes I do work with Pomodoro so I guess it wasn't visible so I have this is what I use for Pomodoro it's just really basic tomato timer calm you know so I do my normal 25minute Pomodoro sessions between each we have 5minute break after four sessions do a 10minute break so it's it's a really nice way to break up the work I find that that 5minute break allows me to think about where I'm at in the project what I'm doing otherwise it's easy for me to get stuck on one thing I can keep trying to let's say find a bug in this one place without thinking of the other possibilities that 5minute break allows me to step back for a second and think one like is this problem even worth all the time that I'm putting into it and then I can decide well maybe not maybe it should be put off until later because it's not really that big of a thing and there are more you know high priority issues to deal with or I could think you know what maybe I should try this other place to look for this bug or something so I really like that aspect of it it's nice you know organization it allows me to see like at the end of the day I can say okay I've done this many Pomodoro sessions that's good for me if I haven't done that many I can think what was I doing and I you know if I look back and say okay well I had three meetings today all right I know what I was doing but if I can look back and say I didn't have any meetings today you know what did I do like I don't know like I was it was I just reading blogs about new frameworks all day or something like so it's kind of like a nice way to keep track of my my productivity as well okay cool yeah if anybody ever wants to know more about the Pomodoro Technique and how I track things so I do use that in conjunction with Trello just kind of give me estimates of my projects I've gone over that before on some of the streams but I'm definitely open to going over it again okay so here's a cool tip so no beers saying with so with Emmet instead of earlier I typed div like this to get a div but he said I can just do what he says I could have just done this and oops wait a second where'd he go just type dot and then it's not working for me maybe I have to change the setting or something but it for right now it is not working maybe if I just add a class like there we go all right cool so nobody here was right I just wasn't doing doing it right so if you just type dot and then put your class names it'll just by default put a div in there really cool thanks okay okay there's some talk about different editors and which ones are free or not that I haven't downloaded at him in a long time it's been on my machines for quite a while maybe like a year a year and a half ago might have been the last time I downloaded at them at that point it was completely free I'm assuming it's still completely free sublime and this is I'm just gonna summarize what was going on here in the live chat for a while it seems like you can use sublime somehow for free but there's a paid version as well I don't know what the difference is between the two it seems like brackets is also paid and Visual Studio code is definitely free although it was said that there seemed to be ways around paying for things I'm not gonna endorse that so that's entirely up to you whether you want to do that but at least officially you do need to pay for brackets and at least some version of sublime safari design asks if I'm recording the whole episode yes so all these streams are recorded and they're available on free code camp just within minutes after the stream ends I put all the videos into one big playlist called live coding with Jesse and then sometimes I split out and I also have videos from each project in their own playlist I don't have a playlist for this project yet but project two does have its own playlist but usually the stream is kind of at the top of the video list since I do streams you know on a ideal week I do it five times a week so it's never really that far down the list you can find one of these strains brian says show her some love I'm assuming that came when I was talking about my wife and and her doctors appointment everything so yeah thanks I mean that's really about all I can do is show some love because I'm not I mean medically it's just like you know there's some things you can do like so like cut out a lot of caffeine and do the physical therapy and things like that you know exercise you know but that's a lot of basic things and I can't I can encourage her but I can't I can't do it for her so hopefully hopefully everything gets back to normal one day so I think I talked about this on a stream awhile ago so I'm not gonna bring it all up again but about last November last October my my youngest daughter was born and my wife had a rupture when the birth happened and it was it was really really lucky that my wife and the baby didn't die but she was sent home from the hospital like the next day or maybe two days later and they never caught that it had ruptured even though there was all this I'm not gonna go into details but there were there was definitely signs that something had happened but they still let her go home and so for like a month we had no idea what's going on but there are all these problems so just to cut to the point she had to have really major surgery we can't have kids anymore and it was very traumatic for her so that's why we're at now almost a year from from when that happened and it's still she's still having medical issues and you know mental health issues so it's just been really hard for you know I think she thought and I thought too that you know she'd be completely you know kind of over this by now and and I think a lot of other people thought that too so it's hard because she's not really getting a lot of understanding or sympathy from people you know that are in the family and around her because they all assume hey well you over this yet so anyway I'm sure it'll be I'm sure it'll work out it's just going to take time let's see safari design says I always feel unmotivated when coding then my motivation spikes all of a sudden out of nowhere so yes it right around the time when I was talking about my wife I was also talking about my lack of motivation today and yes it's a it I don't know my motivation is weird I mentioned I mentioned yesterday I'm not I think it was yes maybe was the day before who knows at some time recently I had mentioned some like stuff about depression and mental health so I'm not gonna redo my whole speech about that but I think a lot of my lack of motivation is is twofold one well aside from everything going on with my wife which I'm sure is is impacting me I really have been super busy and have not even made an attempt to exercise in weeks that's definitely hurting me also I'm on a new antidepressant medication and I'm sure my body is trying to adjust to that and so that's just some days are better than others but right now it's like I just don't want to get out of bed ever so hopefully it'll all be better in four to six weeks that's what they told me so right now caffeine is is helping supply some of the lack of motivation John Hanson says all the best wishes to your wife's recovery thank you I really appreciate that okay John John Hanson clarified so a couple minutes ago I wasn't sure he was referring to some time I said never and I couldn't remember what I said so he clarified and said you said never about needing to go back into the new homepage to edit it yeah you're right I should not say never if I'm lucky I will never have but realistically I'll probably have to at least once when the URL changes for the new student applications for the prospective students to apply so I will well assuming that this version goes live before the application goes live which who knows I don't know I don't really know if we can get this new stuff live before October when I have to switch back to project one for a while I think that would be really ambitious to think that we could get it to the point where it would be good and get approval from everybody that needs to approve it so it really may not be and so closer to I don't know maybe realistically like we're probably talking like December I don't know we'll say I'm hopeful it'll be earlier than that but things tend to move really slowly around here no matter how fast I can build a site like it just seems like for the big sites like this it has to go through a lot of Hoops to get to get approval our Sebastian says last year I had a car accident where I broke my left arm I had to have surgery to fix my bone and now I have five screws my arm I couldn't lift my fingers or hand for almost three months and had no sensitivity now it's almost fully recovered still feeling weird but it's at 99% function functionality I can't lift hard stuff and my sensitivity is not 100% but it's okay all right so that's Wow and so that was a year ago okay well that's I mean I'm sorry that happened to you but I'm really glad that you brought up it's just the idea that I get at least it's somewhat normal today a whole year later not be fully recovered as I like that idea I guess it makes me feel like this is somewhat normal and you know my wife will be okay I think she'll be okay and the doctors think should be okay okay so Tafari design has another question about editors since when working at a company do they allow you to use your own editors on the company computer Roland says depends on the company that's that's exactly what I was thinking as well yeah so it does depend here at the University when I first started working here it was it was difficult to get any anything on my computer at first because so I didn't have admin access to the computer on the IT department did at some point I finally got admin access because I submitted a list of a lot of stuff that I would need for development and at that point I just came in and talked with some of the people from IT and we got on the same page about what I what my development process was like what I needed and kind of like how careful I was gonna be about everything and then I was allowed to have to have access the condition to that was that I don't have I'm not connected like to the main network but in some of the ways that other computers are connected so I was fine with that because I didn't need access to anything but just in case I happen to screw something up which I never have but it's possible that it wouldn't spread it's a lot of other computers so that's um that was that with me so since that point I've been able to use whatever editors I you know I wanted the good thing about like Adam and Visual Studio code is at least on a Mac the download process and installation actually doesn't require you to have an admin password like admin access I think it's probably has something to do with it being electron based because I've noticed that other things that our electron base also do that so anyway technically I guess you could get around it yeah but I have heard of companies where things are really locked down I talked to a guy that's a developer he lives in the same city as me but he actually works up in Pittsburgh and he said like there are some companies that he his agency works for that are even really picky about like what what linters get used in your editor like so it's you know they're picky right down to really my new details in really in situations where it doesn't make sense that they're that picky so I I guess I'm kind of fortunate and that I get a lot of leeway to pick my tools and even you've seen from project to project I like to try out different things so not everybody has it like that johnjohn pink B says is there way to upload to code pound a previously downloaded code pen zip file I don't I don't know I've never tried to do that I heard about that being done so sorry I really can't give you an answer maybe somebody else with the live chat has had experience with that but yeah I've I really have no idea okay there's a there's still a lot of talk about the the editors so I'm skipping over a lot of the editor discussion since I don't know we've have we have so many discussions about editors I'm just gonna I'm just going to skip okay at some point safari design said that I should split my screen so that we could see the code and the design at the same time I could probably do that but it kind of depends like I when we're when we're looking at like kind of a more narrow screen that's fine but if I want to get a wider view obviously I can't do that so that's why I have normally been flipping back and forth and a lot of times I like to use dev tools so I don't know maybe I could have another desktop view that split and just have that open like as a duplicate and go to that off to think about it because I do see some people in other videos that make that work with the split it's just always seemed to me like I don't have enough space when I'm splitting my screen like that so but I mean I could I could try to give it a shot sometime okay so if somebody I'm so somebody put a message in the live chat that are in other characters other than what I'm used to reading so I'm gonna do a Google Translate really quick to try to get it into something I can't understand and let's see okay so it looks like Mari Sava so let me know if that's wrong but this way I'm getting from Google Translate so Mari Sava says hello Jessi just sitting and watching your video react project to day five I love it so much that I wanted to say hello for a long time and say thank you well you're welcome thank you so much for saying that I really appreciate that that always makes me really happy when when someone appreciates what I'm doing and and get something out of it so thank you thank you again for saying that Mari also says it's 8 p.m. there so have a good evening so maybe more you didn't hear that my response to that maybe maybe later maybe a more you can watch the recording or something but let's see Tafari design says Jessie's code is so neat it makes my mind all fuzzy thinking about freshly Windex glass Thanks I don't I don't it doesn't look that neat to me like honestly this looks a lot more messy than my code normally is but but like I said normally I I have it automatically formatted for me so you can't really I can't really take credit for it before you design says is react hard a lot of companies require that skill nowadays jonbi says hey Jambi hey how's it going only way you'll find out is if you try it see if it's difficult for you or easy you might be surprised go check the react documentation page they have a tutorial for it you yeah definitely I try it out I think when I first tried react I thought it was hard just did I get my mind around the concept and and the terminology and things that was a little bit hard for me but I watched videos of people doing it and did some tutorials and then little by little I got used to it that's probably different you know for different people depending on your your experiences before trying to learn reacts for me it was a little bit of a challenge but now that I'm using reacts I think I actually think it's really easy to do you know do things and react and I mean I've we've done just on this dream alone you know we've used several different things we've done serverside rendered react we've pulled in data from api's we've done we've used create react react app and with react router so we've done a lot of cool stuff on a project I'm doing right now for for a course on the side I'm using redux I'm starting to learn react native and they all seem really cool I mean I'm not gonna lie Redux is probably the most challenging thing so far for me but still I'm you know I've only been exposed to it for you know weeks yeah maybe like a month it made probably over a month now but I really haven't been able to dedicate consistent time every day to it if I had maybe I'd understand it a bit more right now but even even with all that I think I have a good grasp of things at this point and I mean it hasn't really taken that long so I say give react a shot okay lost my place no Peter says Jessie check the the right search input when I clicked it it redirects the search page yeah right now it does that so it shouldn't do that I'm not sure what the problem is so I am gonna have to check that yeah cuz on the demo site it doesn't do that so I'll figure it out I'll get that working nobody is said to try footer copyright margin top 20 pixels okay I'll have to give that a shot later on safari design asks if I'm a freelance web developer no well I mean I do some freelance work on the side but my fulltime job as a web developer is at a university I John Hanson said break the lines out of their container it's easier and use flex and no need for media queries okay so I'll have to mess around with flex with these and see if I can get that working okay Sebastian says in Visual Studio code the bottom blue bar if you click spaces cool and then using spaces yeah too okay so I have two now so it's not did it automatically do anything I can't even tell him that oh cool it looks like maybe you do so that's definitely two spaces now cool yeah that looks like it did automatically change everything all right all right Sebastian thank you that like it looks so much better to me now awesome that's how a design said Jessie don't tell everyone all your business we respect your privacy but also said I also wish all the best for your wife as well thank you I appreciate that yeah I know I don't have to tell my business but I don't know sometimes I feel like if I talk about things it helps me but it also helps anybody else that may be going through something similar so you know it's alright I don't mind talking about that stuff I'm just worried that you all don't wouldn't want to hear that like you want to hear the code stuff so I'm worried that I go on too long about it so but otherwise you know I don't I don't mind talking about that stuff and you know especially to like about the depression stuff I really don't mind talking about that at all because I think I think people need to talk about that more and not be ashamed of it you know like you know you get if you break your leg you break your leg it's fine everybody knows you break your leg and they realize you know you're gonna walk slow for a while right you might have a wheelchair crutches right so if you have depression it's gonna impact your life and how how you can do things but if we never talk about it you know people aren't going to know people are going to realize that that that's a legitimate thing and it definitely impacts someone's ability to do things just like a broken leg would impact it I mean not not just like but in a similar way as a broken leg would impact physically how you can walk you know depression would impact mentally how you can interact with the world do your job do I mean so I don't know so I I think as long as we don't I like the idea of being open with it I don't like the idea that if you're open with it you know you could be discriminated against for jobs and things like that as long as that doesn't happen I'm all for people knowing just more about it in general and I think we could benefit so for me right now I'm not gonna lose my job if I have depression so I'm in a position where I think I can talk about it you know to other people and have it you know on YouTube so so I am so I'm going to talk about it not all the time occasionally you know and hopefully that couldn't help but I mean this thing is mainly about code so it's it's always gonna be at least like 90% about code if not more nobody said oh that's so sad to hear about your wife thank thank you I appreciate you saying that Sebastian says I'm so sorry about your wife hope she gets well soon Sampson says same I appreciate appreciate y'all Rohan says best wishes for your family I really appreciate I think thank you all I'll definitely let my my wife know that you are we're wishing her the best and everything oh cool so Mari Sava was the right the right translation of that so awesome marisol this is Jesse you made my day awesome I'm glad I'm glad that I could do that I hide a B Shaykh says is is it better than brackets for web development so it's Visual Studio code better than brackets I've never used brackets so I can't say for sure but so far I like Visual Studio code okay John B says on the subject of being worried about space with Visual Studio code you can toggle word wrap with the option key and and Z or on Windows the Alt key and Z let's actually let's do that right now so I don't forget so options cool I you know what until you said that I didn't even realize that I did not have word wrap on because I've had it on by default and Adam for so long that it didn't even occur to me and that's a lot nicer not thank you I'm learning a lot of cool stuff about Visual Studio code I'm glad I decided to use this for the stream okay all right well I'm going to wrap the stream up because the people are here from IT check things out so thank you so much for watching and I'll be back tomorrow have a great day
