00:08 - hey everybody and welcome to live
00:11 - streaming with Jesse a live coding with
00:13 - Jesse and today we're gonna do something
00:17 - different I thought we'd do some react
00:21 - native so I have a react native project
00:24 - that I'm nearly finished with and I
00:29 - don't know that it's gonna work out how
00:33 - I wanted it to so I anticipated doing
00:36 - some work with Redux and react native
00:38 - but here's my problem I don't know if
00:43 - you can see this we make it a bit bigger
00:46 - I was trying to update my packages and
00:54 - it's it's just hanging I can't I tried
00:57 - restarting my computer and doing it
01:00 - again so I'm not sure if this is gonna
01:04 - work like that but what we can do is we
01:09 - can do some other work so right now I'm
01:11 - running two different branches
01:12 - I'm running a the master branch which
01:16 - has all the same functionality but it
01:18 - doesn't use Redux and then I have a
01:20 - Redux branch so what we should be able
01:23 - to do if if this won't work is just
01:27 - switch back to the master branch and
01:28 - then work off of that branch and and
01:32 - everything should still work fine so
01:38 - just to introduce you to what we're
01:42 - working on this is a flashcard app this
01:45 - is the final project for the react nano
01:48 - degree from Udacity so this is how I'm
01:53 - implementing that project I'm sure
01:56 - there's a lot of different ways that it
01:57 - could be done basically what it does is
02:02 - it lets you create decks of flashcards
02:06 - and then you can quiz yourself on them
02:11 - so run it through quickly
02:14 - so these are the decks I can click on
02:16 - one of these decks and we can start the
02:19 - quiz and I could answer obviously you
02:25 - see the u.s. they'll need some work so I
02:29 - click the first one to be correct the
02:32 - second one will do in correct us to show
02:33 - how the grading works basically you make
02:35 - the the question and the answer and you
02:40 - can toggle back and forth between the
02:42 - question and the answer and then once
02:44 - you're done it gives you the score in
02:46 - this case we got a 50% and then you can
02:49 - also add cards so this I don't think
02:53 - will work right now but let's just try
02:57 - to add one yeah see it's not going to
02:58 - work because this branch is trying to
03:03 - use redux to do this but all the redux
03:06 - packages are not installed so let's
03:08 - dismiss that go back and you're also
03:12 - able to add a new deck this is not gonna
03:15 - work most likely as well let's submit
03:18 - that oh you know what I don't think I
03:20 - hope that went up to redux yet so that
03:24 - didn't throw an error yet but that's how
03:27 - it's supposed to work all right yeah
03:30 - this still is not working so let's just
03:33 - cancel that for now and switch over to
03:37 - our other branch
03:48 - okay I do want to probably have to
03:52 - restart this
03:59 - there we go okay let's run yarn quickly
04:05 - in this branch I'd like to at least test
04:08 - to see if it was something I was trying
04:13 - to do on the branch or if it's something
04:15 - wrong with this computer we'll let that
04:23 - go for a minute just to see see what's
04:26 - going on but let's check out a little
04:30 - bit of the code they make this a bit
04:34 - bigger
04:38 - and let me say hey to everyone in the
04:43 - live chat before we start to put it it's
04:52 - uh Nance and says you broke it yes I
04:54 - somehow I broke the Arne I don't I don't
04:58 - know what I did
04:59 - alright see that's not that's still not
05:01 - working so let's just quit that and
05:07 - let's refresh
05:15 - hmm maybe I'll restart the server this
05:25 - actually the first time I've tried to
05:26 - run this on this computer I've been
05:29 - developing this on my my laptop so it's
05:36 - probably why I'm having problems I
05:37 - didn't it didn't allow enough time
05:39 - before the stream to test everything out
05:41 - but here's some of the code that we're
05:44 - working with and I guess since we
05:48 - haven't ever worked with react native on
05:51 - this stream I'll do a little intro it's
05:54 - going to be really familiar if you're if
05:56 - you've been watching what we're doing
05:58 - with react but there are a few
06:00 - differences so I'm just going to run
06:01 - through the differences quickly just to
06:05 - make it a little bit easier to to
06:07 - understand what's going on and why we
06:10 - had to do things a little differently
06:12 - let's see dragon hunter said am I too
06:15 - late no no I haven't said yeah and
06:19 - nobody's too late yet we haven't haven't
06:23 - really started anything let's see
06:42 - yes I am using using Adam okay heart
06:47 - should also asked about your PR Arshad
06:49 - I'm testing that pool request
06:51 - so I've downloaded it to a different
06:54 - branch and I'm testing it I think I
06:56 - ended up using the service that you
07:00 - recommended the M lab setting up a
07:05 - MongoDB database and that was all
07:10 - working I think my problem still is the
07:14 - email thing
07:15 - so the was a email mail trap for some
07:22 - reason it still doesn't work I think you
07:25 - had mentioned something about possibly
07:27 - the port's being blocked by my network
07:29 - I'm thinking that that's the problem
07:31 - because I've had issues before with
07:35 - ports in the past so I know the the
07:40 - ports are kind of on lockdown here so
07:43 - what I'm gonna do and this is why I
07:46 - decided not to livestream that because
07:48 - I'm not going to try to do any work on
07:50 - that project until I'm gonna go home on
07:55 - my home network where I have more
07:57 - control over what ports or blocks I'm
08:00 - gonna test everything out there
08:02 - hopefully it all works out then and then
08:08 - if it works out I'll merge it all just
08:11 - gonna have to come up with some other
08:12 - way to do testing I guess from you know
08:18 - from work from my office so anyway
08:21 - that's why I haven't merged yet and
08:23 - that's why we're not working on it right
08:24 - now so hopefully at least don't know if
08:29 - it still doesn't work at home then maybe
08:31 - it's something else but from everything
08:34 - that I've tried doing with it it's it's
08:37 - probably a port thing so I'll have more
08:41 - info about that tomorrow
08:44 - alright so let me go no no beer it so I
08:51 - forget to shave yeah
08:53 - I have not Harsha is asking change
08:58 - support 25 I changed I tried port 25 I
09:01 - tried port for something whatever the
09:04 - other one you recommended was I tried
09:06 - all this porch nothing worked so yes
09:09 - I'll just I'll try it out at home
09:15 - Trieste if I'm drunk I am NOT drunk now
09:19 - I haven't been any alcohol today
09:23 - actually for a while I don't remember
09:25 - the last time I drank okay let's let me
09:33 - start my timer and
09:43 - okay so we're just going to go over some
09:45 - code first and then maybe we'll try to
09:48 - do some updates
09:50 - maybe with with the UI so sorry about
09:53 - the misleading title really did want to
09:56 - work with with redux but and so I figure
10:01 - out what's going on with yarn we could
10:05 - do work with redux and reasonably expect
10:08 - that it would do what we want it to do
10:09 - but I have no way to test it so let's
10:14 - check this out first of all well we'll
10:18 - start at the beginning here with our app
10:21 - dot J's file obviously you know we make
10:24 - this a bit bigger for you all so the
10:29 - setup for package.json is is actually
10:33 - should look pretty similar to any other
10:36 - react project and then I've added in our
10:38 - standard linting that we've been using
10:41 - on all our projects with with prettier
10:43 - and standard Jass you notice a little
10:47 - bit something's a little different
10:48 - instead of react strips we have react
10:50 - native scripts right so everything is is
10:52 - going to say you know react native
10:56 - instead we're using expo which it brings
11:04 - in expo does a lot of stuff you'll see
11:06 - us bringing in some components and
11:08 - things from expo we're importing it in
11:12 - various parts of our app it also comes
11:15 - with an app that you can download and
11:19 - then allows you to test out the app on
11:23 - your phone and debug and everything you
11:26 - know right there so let's see all right
11:32 - so not a lot going on with the
11:35 - package.json let's check out our app j/s
11:38 - okay so we're bringing in you know react
11:42 - just like normal we have let's go over
11:48 - some of the navigation because now the
11:49 - navigation is probably one of the
11:52 - biggest differences between react and
11:54 - back native that I've dealt with so far
11:56 - so if you notice we're bringing in we're
11:58 - not using react router we're using react
12:01 - navigation we're bringing in a tab
12:03 - navigator and a stack navigator so the
12:09 - the navigation is definitely see where
12:15 - I'm pulling this in okay so here's the
12:19 - the first part I have a tab navigator
12:23 - and now this obviously these are the
12:26 - tabs at the top or if if you're on
12:28 - Android the tabs are at the top if
12:30 - you're on iOS the tabs at the bottom one
12:32 - of the cool things about react native is
12:35 - the there are some standard components
12:38 - that get rendered differently based on
12:41 - whether you're on iOS or Android so
12:44 - it'll use like the native styling
12:47 - options for those which is really cool
12:51 - you don't have to worry about doing that
12:52 - yourself so in this case we added some
13:00 - some tabs we have a list view tab and a
13:03 - deck view tab this is really
13:05 - straightforward right we have our screen
13:08 - right this is the label tab our label
13:10 - this is what the user will see and then
13:13 - we say what component is going to render
13:17 - so you can see all our views over here
13:20 - our react components so we just tell the
13:24 - Navigator what component to display as
13:26 - the view when you click on that
13:28 - particular tab so super easy notice we
13:32 - do import this so it's very similar to
13:34 - react router in those terms but we have
13:40 - we also have some options so you can
13:43 - style your tab bar okay just your basic
13:46 - basic options colors and things like
13:49 - that but then we also have the stack
13:52 - navigator and think of the stack
13:53 - navigator like if you were to click on
13:55 - buttons within the app you wouldn't want
13:59 - the views to change right but you don't
14:01 - want every single view to be
14:03 - on your tabs that you would have to
14:05 - weigh too many tabs so this is where all
14:08 - the rest of them the rest will come into
14:10 - play so we're bringing in the tabs here
14:14 - so we're actually so we've we've named
14:19 - this tab navigator tabs right we saved
14:21 - it to that constant so we're pulling all
14:23 - of this in and then in addition to that
14:26 - we're adding a screen for what we call
14:29 - it work for a deck view our new question
14:32 - view our quiz view and you saw all those
14:35 - views when we did the demo a few minutes
14:39 - ago right so that's how navigation works
14:43 - so some elements are familiar but that
14:48 - was definitely something I had to grab
14:50 - my head around you know to understand I
14:53 - was coming from you know browser mode
14:56 - using you know react router so a little
15:00 - bit different for that let's see as far
15:04 - as this page is concerned I think that's
15:07 - all you don't want to go over maybe this
15:11 - since it's this here we'll talk about
15:12 - this we have this style sheet dot create
15:15 - and you'll notice I guess it's hard to
15:18 - see on this base we'll go to another
15:19 - page here so maybe it's a little bit
15:22 - more obvious where's your stuff there we
15:25 - go
15:25 - so we're using style sheet create we
15:29 - don't have to do it this way but there's
15:30 - a performance improvement if you add
15:33 - your Styles in like this and then you
15:37 - know this is just a JavaScript object
15:39 - and then we can put it in here so on our
15:42 - view we have style
15:43 - we just have style style container so
15:45 - then everything under container is
15:49 - applied to this component right you'll
15:52 - notice there are no there's no
15:55 - indication of pixels or anything like
15:57 - that everything in react native is just
16:02 - just straight numbers okay so they don't
16:04 - you know we don't have like VH or pixels
16:09 - or eeehm
16:10 - whatever you want to will you normally
16:12 - use in the browser obviously we're still
16:14 - doing since this is a JavaScript object
16:16 - we're camel casing everything we're
16:19 - actually importing colors so we have a
16:21 - color CAS file and we're just bringing
16:24 - in the colors from there so we have
16:27 - purple and white coming in let's see I
16:36 - have just some some test data up here so
16:39 - this will actually be gone in the the
16:42 - production version of this app but I
16:45 - needed some test data to work on before
16:48 - I had everything set up and working
16:51 - okay we're using async storage instead
16:54 - of local storage so there isn't local
16:57 - storage on your your device the
17:00 - equivalent would be async storage
17:02 - depending on your device whether it's
17:04 - iOS or Android the database that's
17:06 - holding that in the background will be
17:09 - different but you don't have to worry
17:10 - about that a sink storage takes care of
17:12 - all that and you have a simple API to
17:15 - use that so for now it's just get item
17:18 - right so we're safe everything is just
17:21 - saved as key value pairs so all of our
17:24 - our decks are saved with under the key
17:27 - decks right and then so in this
17:32 - particular case we're just getting
17:34 - everything all of them and then we're
17:36 - just looping through them all let's see
17:44 - there's oh okay the only other
17:47 - difference you'll see we don't have divs
17:48 - or P tags right we have views so instead
17:53 - of a div you're probably going to want
17:54 - to use view wherever you would normally
17:57 - use a div and instead of a P tag you
17:59 - want to use text that's just in general
18:03 - so you would never just have text right
18:07 - normally you could have just text inside
18:10 - of a view that isn't wrapped in a
18:12 - component but you can't do that in react
18:13 - native you have to have any text wrapped
18:16 - inside of a text tag so that's that's
18:21 - probably the other really big difference
18:23 - so
18:24 - probably the way you do routing and then
18:26 - the views and text instead of divs and P
18:31 - tags probably the biggest biggest
18:35 - differences I guess I could show on let
18:43 - me show one that has input so you can
18:51 - see with the inputs it's actually not
18:53 - that it's not that different from what
18:57 - you would normally see the cool thing
18:59 - though is we don't have to worry as much
19:02 - about styling inputs so by default
19:05 - depending on what you're using you get
19:08 - that default device style so so that's
19:14 - kind of nice you can of course style it
19:16 - however you want but if you if you
19:19 - didn't want to worry about that you get
19:20 - default styling which is cool all right
19:24 - so let's let's actually do some some
19:29 - coding with this and let me see how much
19:32 - time I have I do want to answer
19:33 - questions I know I see the live chat is
19:35 - a lot going on in there right now so I
19:37 - will as soon as this pommeroy time is up
19:39 - I'll go and answer some questions and
19:42 - then we'll see how much time we have I
19:44 - have a meeting in about an hour
19:46 - so I can't go any longer than that and I
19:50 - need to get I need to get some data
19:52 - ready for the meeting so probably need
19:55 - to end no later than like 45 minutes
19:59 - from now okay
20:03 - looks like my app froze on my
20:12 - my device so I'm gonna restart it so we
20:15 - can actually see what's going on well
20:18 - that's well that's working let's go back
20:22 - over here and we
20:38 - let's see okay here we go all right so
20:43 - it's back we're back here let's um let's
20:47 - take a look at the UI and see where we
20:50 - could have some improvements here one
20:52 - thing that I've noticed probably could
20:55 - be improvement is uh we need these
20:59 - titles need to be bigger and uniform
21:00 - throughout right now they're not uniform
21:02 - throughout so we can we also need that
21:09 - let's add a card because a couple of
21:14 - cards so that we can see the UI so that
21:19 - should be good but your notice right now
21:20 - here's my biggest problem the UI doesn't
21:25 - automatically update when you add a card
21:26 - so right now the data is there so the
21:36 - data for those two new cards that we
21:38 - just put in is there in a sink storage
21:41 - so but it's not reflected yet so what
21:46 - I'd have to do then is reload and when
21:49 - we reload you'll see it's it'll be
21:50 - reflected see so now we have our two
21:52 - cards okay so now we can see our quiz
21:59 - all right so we have our question and
22:02 - answer and we have this is the second
22:10 - question right so so that works now but
22:16 - what I need to have happen and this is
22:18 - why I was starting to implement Redux I
22:20 - mean also it's the data is a little bit
22:22 - cleaner with Redux anyway but I wanted
22:29 - to try to get that automatic refresh but
22:33 - since we can't really get Redux working
22:35 - right now we're gonna put that on hold
22:36 - and instead we're going to work a little
22:37 - bit on the UI so here's what I'd like to
22:40 - do these buttons are way too big in
22:44 - proportion to the other text on the page
22:46 - so the text inside the buttons as well
22:48 - as the title and everything so let's
22:50 - just do some style
22:51 - and lesson react native the stylings not
22:55 - it's not that different but it is a
22:58 - little bit odd to get used to a unitless
23:03 - styling okay so we're we knew we're deck
23:08 - view okay so we're in our deck view and
23:11 - let's go down to our styles and let's
23:17 - check out our font size I think we can
23:19 - definitely for our title we can double
23:21 - that font size and I think that'll still
23:24 - look look pretty good our number I think
23:31 - the numbers fine for right now that's
23:33 - that this area right here and you can
23:35 - see we've already seen since we have my
23:38 - device is connected to my computer right
23:40 - now and so it's Auto refreshing every
23:43 - time we change something which is nice
23:45 - so this is a lot nicer size I think I'll
23:48 - stick with that for now and let's maybe
23:50 - adjust these a bit I want to keep the
23:53 - buttons large enough so that they can
23:55 - comfortably be clicked by users even if
23:58 - the user happens to have a large thumb
24:03 - so I'm hesitant to make the buttons any
24:07 - smaller but I would like to make the
24:11 - proportions a bit nicer so let's check
24:15 - out our button let's see how we have
24:19 - this here so our text let's make another
24:26 - another we're gonna it only this works
24:30 - like a class but you know what I'm
24:31 - saying it's not really a class since
24:37 - this is just a JavaScript object that
24:39 - we're gonna call this button text and
24:47 - I call this button text I guess I don't
24:50 - have I don't have space between these
24:54 - and let's make the button text let's see
25:00 - what 20 looks like I think it might be a
25:03 - bit too big but we're gonna try it out
25:04 - so we'll go font size 20 and we'll leave
25:14 - the color alone right now let's see what
25:18 - this looks like
25:19 - oops we didn't put it I didn't apply it
25:22 - so here's what we need to do and that's
25:25 - not a comma so let's take this this text
25:29 - we're actually going to use we're going
25:32 - to apply it to both of these and we need
25:37 - to add style and let's go with styles
25:44 - dot button text
25:51 - okay now we'll save that and see how it
25:55 - looks okay not bad not bad so you can
25:58 - see this I think that that font size is
26:02 - more appropriate given the size of our
26:05 - buttons okay not bad I still don't
26:11 - really love the proportions though oh it
26:20 - would probably better if we had a title
26:22 - of this deck that it was more reasonable
26:26 - so let's add a deck let's see okay
26:39 - that's a little bit bigger I'm gonna
26:41 - submit that and once again we actually
26:44 - have to manually reload this to get it
26:46 - to show up here we go here's our test
26:49 - deck okay this is not bad not bad
27:04 - okay let's let's check out our whoops Oh
27:11 - interesting
27:13 - I have to do something like that maybe
27:17 - if there are no cards then let's disable
27:21 - that start quiz how about that let's add
27:24 - that in right now because you know we
27:27 - don't really want that behavior so I
27:28 - don't know if you saw that but when I
27:29 - click start quiz since there's no cards
27:33 - that automatically takes me to the score
27:35 - screen and obviously we can't get a
27:40 - score if there are no cards so let's
27:43 - change that so right now on that button
27:47 - to start the quiz we have on press and
27:49 - then we navigate to the quiz but what we
27:54 - want to do instead is check first to see
27:57 - if there are any cards and if there
27:59 - aren't cards we don't want to navigate
28:03 - so let's remove this yeah let's remove
28:10 - this and we're going to bring it up here
28:22 - that's
28:32 - and the navigation so I don't know about
28:37 - you but before I started react native I
28:41 - was afraid that it would just be way you
28:44 - know just so much more different that I
28:46 - wouldn't I wouldn't be able to to catch
28:49 - on very quickly but you could see I mean
28:52 - this is very much like what we what
28:56 - we're used to so let's see we're gonna
29:02 - need to put let's let's make this so
29:06 - that it can handle our clicks on both
29:08 - buttons so what we need to bring in then
29:11 - is the view and the deck and so here
29:21 - what we can bring in there is
29:37 - oops I don't know why get rid of that
29:42 - what did I call that handle navigation
29:47 - navigation and what did we call it we
29:52 - quiz so that you was quiz and then we
30:00 - did bring in where did we get that from
30:05 - oh okay
30:08 - we're already bringing in deck here so
30:13 - okay and let's copy this
30:31 - and for this one we're going to bring in
30:37 - new question
30:44 - so if you notice here normally we would
30:47 - put an on click here for a button but
30:50 - it's it's on press for react native
30:53 - which makes sense we're not not clicking
30:55 - you know this is all touchscreen alright
31:01 - let's see question you need to put in
31:09 - view and then yeah this should be fine
31:16 - the way it is let's save that and we'll
31:27 - click it
31:27 - let's see if it works
31:33 - whoops no she's not the fine
31:36 - whoops I didn't say
31:51 - all right let's chat again my addition
31:57 - is not a function
32:09 - what did I do wrong okay now it's
32:14 - working all right great
32:17 - so it's working and it looks like it's
32:21 - taking us to the right place and it's
32:24 - passing the data we can double-check
32:26 - that it's faster data by going to
32:27 - something actually does have data yeah
32:29 - and those are the right question
32:31 - oops sorry I didn't realize I didn't
32:33 - know this on the screen I'll do this
32:35 - again this we can see this one it is
32:39 - passing the right card data and it's
32:42 - obviously going to the right spot so now
32:45 - that we've implemented that we can say
32:50 - at least for this on press so we're
32:59 - gonna say if my shirts yes we're gonna
33:09 - say if deck questions dot length is
33:21 - greater than zero
33:35 - okay I've had questions length greater
33:37 - than zero
33:38 - I didn't want to deck all right let's
33:41 - see if I work no we're ready
34:12 - okay I'm getting an error be so against
34:15 - something
34:17 - my
34:35 - whoops let's try to make this irregular
34:39 - otherwise
34:55 - no questions
35:00 - all right let's make this
35:09 - oops
35:14 - all right so basically what I want to do
35:15 - with this there's no questions is
35:17 - indicate to the user that they need to
35:19 - add a question so for right now
35:33 - right now that's gonna be a console.log
35:35 - which obviously isn't gonna help the
35:36 - user that much on a device but at least
35:39 - this will remind me what I intend to do
35:41 - with this in case we don't get get to it
35:43 - during the stream all right so my timer
35:49 - is up so let me set my five-minute timer
35:53 - and oh there we go
35:56 - getting more useful feedback here that's
36:06 - my old code
36:14 - very uh there we go okay so that I keep
36:21 - forgetting you can't see my screen okay
36:23 - so I'm on this test deck now and I'm
36:25 - hitting the start quiz button you can
36:26 - see that feedback there and it's not
36:30 - doing anything but if we go to our other
36:32 - deck where we do have cards we hit start
36:35 - quiz and it does work so that's what
36:38 - we've that's what we've done here is
36:40 - just made sure that you can't start the
36:41 - quiz unless there are actually cards so
36:44 - the next step which we may or may not do
36:45 - on this dream would be to add some sort
36:48 - of visual feedback to the user to remind
36:50 - them that you need to add a card first
36:54 - okay so let me go let me restart that
37:02 - five-minute timer since I went back and
37:05 - did some work let's see I'm gonna go
37:07 - through mmm
37:08 - questions alright let me go through the
37:12 - question just see what's here we may or
37:14 - may not do another Pomodoro session
37:16 - since I do have a meeting coming up soon
37:19 - all right so I'm gonna scroll up and try
37:22 - to work my way down through as many
37:24 - questions as I can
37:25 - [Music]
37:28 - oops you guys can see that but or not
37:35 - also forgot to mention this but there's
37:38 - a live stream going on now from the
37:40 - chrome Developers Conference
37:43 - so if check that out I was watching it a
37:47 - little bit of it earlier and some
37:50 - interesting stuff so I don't know what
37:54 - the times are for everything that I
37:55 - think is going on pretty much all day
37:57 - today
38:16 - paka says i'm trying to master react
38:19 - before going on redux what do you guys
38:21 - think I don't know that you need to
38:26 - master react before getting to before
38:30 - getting to Redux yeah I mean if you end
38:39 - up working on a project project where it
38:41 - makes sense to use Redux
38:43 - I'd say go for it because there are
38:46 - definitely some times where Redux is
38:48 - going to help you significantly and
38:51 - keeping your app keeping the dataflow on
38:55 - your app more sensible so if you're
38:59 - building absolute that they don't really
39:01 - need it then don't worry about it but
39:04 - it's a good thing to know so I mean it's
39:07 - not the only option either right there
39:09 - there are other options for handling
39:10 - your data other than Redux so you may
39:12 - not need to use Redux you could go with
39:15 - what it mob X which I have not used yet
39:20 - but in general when a question is like
39:24 - do I need to master this before doing
39:25 - this my answer is almost always no like
39:29 - you don't need to just learn learn what
39:31 - you need to do for that whatever makes
39:33 - the most sense for your projects and
39:35 - it's not it's not really an either/or
39:38 - thing with these different technologies
39:39 - you can learn them both as you go
39:44 - alright hey Sebastian says update yarn
39:47 - ok cool why I did not try to update yarn
39:50 - yet so I would do that to try to fix my
39:52 - my issues with this dragon on just said
39:57 - a broken yarn still faster than NTM not
40:01 - in this case although I've heard the
40:03 - newer versions of NPM are pretty fast
40:05 - too I haven't seen data as to which
40:07 - one's faster but I think it's better
40:11 - ok Harshit says clean clean the cache
40:16 - and yarn ok I want to try that
40:30 - three thinks I sound drunk on the stream
40:34 - so do I actually sound drunk on the
40:40 - stream I don't know you know how it is
40:42 - when you hear your own voice recorded it
40:45 - always sounds weird to you so my voice
40:47 - always sounds weird I'm not a good judge
40:50 - I guess
40:58 - okay actually let me try this now since
41:07 - we'll try to clean that out and see if
41:12 - that will work
41:16 - Harshit says which version of yarn are
41:19 - you using one per point one cause
41:21 - problems for me yeah you know what I
41:32 - think I'm using a later version of yarn
41:35 - on my laptop because I just I recently
41:37 - upgraded iron on my laptop like sometime
41:40 - within the last two weeks or so so I'm
41:43 - definitely using an older version here
41:46 - so I mean let's give it a shot
41:56 - see maybe maybe something will happen
41:59 - here but okay see Z ohm boy says why do
42:09 - you use Pomodoro app what are the
42:11 - benefits
42:13 - Harshit mentions it helps to manage time
42:16 - and track work yeah definitely so in
42:18 - this case on the stream I also use it to
42:21 - help me to break up the stream and
42:23 - remember to stop coding and check out
42:26 - the live chat answer some questions and
42:28 - then also to remember to stop answering
42:30 - questions go back to the live chat but I
42:32 - do use it even when I'm not streaming
42:34 - and it does help it helps break up the
42:36 - work into manageable chunks keep me on
42:39 - track and keep me taking regular breaks
42:41 - because often it's it's easy for me at
42:44 - least to keep working on a problem and
42:47 - I'm stuck and I keep trying things and
42:48 - trying things and it doesn't work but if
42:50 - I step back and take a break even if
42:52 - it's just for a few minutes for some
42:54 - reason my brain just it needs that
42:58 - little break and then when I come back
42:59 - to it I can i often either solve the
43:02 - problem or I realize you know what there
43:05 - are better things for me to do right now
43:06 - this isn't really a main issue you know
43:11 - I may have been working really hard on
43:13 - some side thing that wasn't essential
43:15 - for the product to launch so I like that
43:22 - little break it really helps I find I'm
43:24 - a lot more productive when I'm using the
43:26 - Pomodoro timer let's see well based on
43:31 - the amount of questions I'm seeing in
43:33 - the live chat I think I should try to
43:34 - get through the questions now and not
43:37 - hey all right you got through it all
43:41 - awesome okay so if you didn't see what
43:45 - just happened there if any of you ever
43:48 - run into a similar problem where yarn
43:50 - just is hanging and not working try yarn
43:53 - cache clean as your command
43:57 - Harshit just mentioned that and thank
43:59 - you for that advice and that worked for
44:02 - me so everything installed now I would
44:07 - want to double check and test this on
44:09 - the other branch as well but we saw I
44:12 - was having the problem on both branches
44:14 - so since it worked on this branch I'm
44:17 - assuming that'll work on the other
44:18 - branch I'm not going to test it right
44:20 - now because we still have changes here
44:22 - that I want to commit first anyway so
44:28 - cool
44:29 - that'll work so maybe I would actually
44:32 - like to have everything finished and
44:34 - turn this project in today so I don't
44:35 - know if we'll work on this more on the
44:37 - stream it depends on whether or not my
44:39 - project passes the review so we'll see
44:43 - if it doesn't pass and I have more work
44:45 - to do maybe we'll do another stream on
44:46 - this otherwise I'll have to implement
44:48 - all the Redux stuff on my own but in any
44:52 - case whenever the project passes then I
44:55 - can I can show you on the ship might not
44:57 - do a whole stream about it but I can
44:59 - show you the finished product and of
45:02 - course it's on my github profile so you
45:07 - can check out the code whenever you want
45:09 - all right so let me just run through the
45:11 - rest of these questions here let's see
45:31 - okay dragon hunter says set in 8vd with
45:38 - android studio why Expo I'm not sure
45:42 - about the first part of that statement
45:44 - but it why use Expo instead of Android
45:48 - studio I'm using Expo because that's how
45:53 - so within the Udacity course that's how
45:56 - we were taught to do app development so
46:00 - I could use Android studio but but this
46:07 - was just the the quickest way to get
46:10 - everything set up
46:16 - alright see the whisper in your ears
46:20 - says that's that's actually the name
46:23 - says hey let me ask you I've been trying
46:27 - to choose full stack frame work and
46:29 - everything came down to meteor or sales
46:31 - apparently there is nothing more
46:34 - dominant these days but people say
46:36 - meteor is dead now
46:39 - Harshit says meteor is not that dead
46:42 - dragon hunter says if pearl is not dead
46:45 - yet then nothing is that I guess the
46:49 - whisper in the ears is kind of weird
46:51 - because meteor has so many stars in
46:52 - github so let's see yet to be honest
47:02 - with you I've seen really cool things
47:04 - done with meteor I don't know about
47:07 - numbers as far as how how many people
47:10 - still use meteor if it's if it is dying
47:13 - I don't really know but from what I've
47:16 - seen built with meteor it's it it was
47:19 - certainly very capable so generally I
47:23 - don't really do full stack stuff here
47:25 - I'm more front-end although we do
47:28 - include some back-end stuff when we need
47:30 - to so I don't know that I'm the best
47:33 - person to give you advice on and it's
47:36 - our framework to choose
47:40 - let's see but maybe if somebody here
47:43 - watching is
47:44 - stack or has an opinion that way you
47:48 - know please share that in the live chat
47:50 - okay all right sory says guys you're
47:58 - wasting your time this is not realistic
48:00 - go elsewhere good luck
48:04 - okay so not sure what would I did that
48:10 - upset three but I guess the streams not
48:15 - for everybody
48:19 - see I'm not sure what he means by
48:22 - realistic I mean this this actually
48:25 - really is a project that I'm doing so I
48:31 - it's realistic for me this is how I work
48:34 - so let's see a harsh it says in response
48:42 - I have already cloned and tested the app
48:44 - yesterday so I'm not wasting my time
48:49 - let's see
49:02 - okay so the whisper New Year's is saying
49:05 - it's still talking about the question of
49:07 - a full-stack framework is saying
49:09 - JavaScript doesn't have a dominant stack
49:11 - like like laravel for PHP Harshit says
49:16 - use pug with express it's really
49:19 - powerful okay Harshit says it gives
49:29 - flexibility
49:43 - okay so I'm not gonna read everything
49:46 - but there's a debate here about whether
49:48 - or not Express is capable in the same
49:54 - way as a full-stack framework is a
49:56 - dominant framework so the debate seems
49:58 - to be from well you can add things to
50:02 - Express to basically do everything that
50:04 - you want it allows a lot of flexibility
50:06 - like that but on the other hand it's not
50:11 - like ready to go you know right off the
50:14 - bat to do everything you need so let's
50:22 - see
50:26 - somebody's mentions happy use H API it's
50:30 - a framework I've never used that so I
50:32 - can't comment on it
50:45 - shree mentions do you know what async
50:51 - async' EO is that a sink that supposed
50:54 - to be a sink I don't really know
50:55 - no I'm I'm not I'm not aware of what a
51:00 - sink EO is Jamal says is this the
51:07 - Udacity project yes it is the Udacity
51:10 - project so it's it's project three of
51:13 - that react nano degree for Udacity so
51:19 - the it's the final project so as soon as
51:23 - I'm done with this and it gets accepted
51:25 - then I'm officially done with the nano
51:28 - degree and and I passed so really
51:31 - excited if you all been watching you
51:33 - know like it's been taking up a lot of
51:35 - my time doing the the nano degree so I
51:37 - learned a lot through this but I'm
51:39 - definitely excited to not spend all my
51:41 - my Saturdays and doing this I'd much
51:46 - rather to have some time to spend with
51:47 - the kids and I'm sure they would rather
51:51 - let me spend time with them as well
51:54 - let's see
51:58 - [Music]
52:14 - [Music]
52:15 - all right sir II said you really can't
52:18 - do this any more than five minutes I'm
52:24 - not sure what I was doing at the time
52:25 - when when you said that tree so I guess
52:30 - if you could elaborate maybe I'll answer
52:33 - but I can't when was that 153 yeah I'm
52:36 - not sure what I was working on at that
52:37 - time sure he also says you can't do it
52:42 - yeah I don't remember what I was working
52:45 - on at the time hard should ask if I need
52:52 - a PR in this project two already cloned
52:54 - and tested it actually hard should I
52:56 - appreciate the offer but I don't feel
52:58 - comfortable taking any PRS for this
53:00 - project since it is for a course so I
53:04 - need to I need to do it all myself since
53:08 - it's for course otherwise as you all
53:10 - know I'm perfectly you know happy to
53:14 - collaborate on projects I'm not I'm not
53:18 - one that needs all the control over
53:20 - things I realized that you all bring a
53:24 - lot of expertise to the table so I'm
53:29 - quick to admit whenever I need to take
53:34 - the help of someone else but in this
53:36 - case since it is for a class and I'm
53:37 - being graded in a sense on this I'm
53:41 - gonna have to figure it out on my own
53:43 - but again thanks for the offer I
53:46 - appreciate that and then certainly after
53:49 - I turn it in if we want to keep working
53:51 - on this I'm definitely open for that if
53:54 - we want to try to make it better and
53:56 - actually launch it as an app that's cool
53:58 - too I think I'll probably still work on
54:00 - it I'd like to maybe have my kids be
54:03 - able to use it to help them study so
54:07 - that's something I'm definitely
54:09 - definitely open to
54:22 - rook says those unitless CSS values are
54:27 - pixels can you use REM as well I'm not
54:31 - sure if they're exactly pixels
54:35 - I don't recall in that part of the
54:37 - course when they explained that I don't
54:38 - recall exactly what they are so I don't
54:43 - know maybe somebody knows but I don't
54:45 - know if they translate exactly to what
54:46 - what pixels would be let's say like if
54:50 - you are in a browser on a mobile device
54:51 - I don't think you can't so ATS also
54:57 - about using a.m. or REM I don't think
54:59 - you can use any units I actually haven't
55:02 - tried but I'm pretty sure that you
55:06 - you're not supposed to use units with
55:07 - that so if you didn't if you don't
55:10 - remember that part it when we're doing
55:12 - the CSS or the styles for in react
55:17 - native there are no units so normally
55:20 - you would see pixels or EMS or something
55:22 - here but we don't use units
55:31 - all right harsh it says I guess the unit
55:33 - is relative to device yeah I think
55:35 - that's how it works it all depends on
55:38 - the I guess the device pixel ratio well
55:44 - and that I don't know there it's hard to
55:47 - talk about it without a unit right but I
55:50 - think it does depend on the the
55:53 - resolution of the screen and size of the
55:55 - screen let's see harsh that says hey
56:05 - Jessie did you hear about Adam IDE check
56:07 - out Adam that I oh yeah actually I I saw
56:10 - something about the Adam IDE I may end
56:15 - up checking out at some point
56:18 - so we'll see maybe I'll test it out we
56:21 - could use on a stream or something when
56:25 - I first heard about it I thought I
56:26 - didn't really need any of that
56:28 - functionality but it would still be cool
56:30 - maybe to take a look at and just just to
56:32 - show everyone John Hanson says the start
56:37 - quiz button looks wider odd yeah let me
56:40 - reload see if it'll work
56:44 - there we go yeah let's check that out
56:51 - actually you're right to start quiz
56:53 - button does look wider interesting I'll
56:59 - have to check that out later on to see
57:03 - if it if it really is wider I mean
57:07 - there's there's yeah it is odd yeah I
57:11 - definitely want them to be the same I
57:13 - don't want one to be wider than the
57:14 - other I may change how these buttons
57:16 - look as well right now at this point I'm
57:21 - not as worried about the Styles because
57:22 - I just need to get this turned in before
57:24 - the deadline so unfortunately it's not
57:27 - gonna look awesome
57:28 - but I just need to fit all the project
57:32 - requirements so I can always style it
57:37 - later on
58:03 - save some debate about between view and
58:07 - reacts which I'm kind of skipping over a
58:10 - bit to look for more questions okay
58:17 - Blake says if I learned react what I
58:19 - also know almost all of react native
58:26 - well it depends on how much you mean by
58:29 - almost all you would know a lot you
58:32 - would know a lot of it so the concepts
58:38 - are the same right so the idea that you
58:44 - have these components that get rendered
58:48 - into something else right that's that's
58:49 - entirely the same but in terms of like
58:54 - specifically how you do things right
58:57 - there are some differences but I mean I
59:01 - pointed out to me at least the big
59:03 - differences for me and learning it and
59:05 - you see they weren't really that big of
59:07 - a deal so I didn't think it was that big
59:13 - of a stretch to move from react to react
59:16 - native okay now I don't know if I went
59:18 - even deeper and try to do something more
59:20 - complex than just a flash card app maybe
59:22 - I would run into some more issues but I
59:27 - think going for me at least going from
59:33 - not using react to do web development to
59:36 - using react was a much harder transition
59:39 - than transitioning from react to react
59:41 - native so that was just my experience
59:46 - but it just didn't seem that hard to
59:50 - translate the concepts into building
59:53 - something you know for phone than doing
59:56 - web development
60:06 - so Blake s so what do you think I should
60:08 - learn yes so Blake I think to be honest
60:20 - with you it depends on what your goals
60:23 - are for for learning right
60:26 - I mean learn whatever you enjoy you know
60:28 - or learn what you need to do for the
60:30 - projects that you're doing but react
60:35 - right now is growing it's continuing to
60:38 - grow there are a lot of react jobs the
60:40 - pay-for react developers is nice so if
60:45 - you enjoy working with react I said go
60:47 - for it I mean are there alternatives
60:50 - that are popular yeah there are
60:52 - alternatives that are popular but I I
60:56 - just I see react more and more in job
61:01 - listings so if your goal is to get a job
61:03 - doing this type of thing then you know
61:06 - it would be I don't think it would be
61:09 - wrong to go with react but it's just a
61:13 - pow mean if you check out to you and you
61:15 - really like you there are jobs for view
61:18 - developers if you check out angular and
61:20 - you love that then they're still you
61:22 - know there are a lot of jobs for that so
61:24 - definitely test out different things but
61:30 - I think you'd be fine if you did want to
61:34 - go with react I think you'd be fine from
61:36 - a from the standpoint of having
61:38 - marketable skills
61:47 - all right I got to keep an eye on the
61:49 - time here okay so I'm good probably
61:53 - about like 10 more minutes I'm going to
61:54 - try to get through the rest of these
61:55 - questions I think I can do it
62:03 - Blake asks well he's asking Harshit
62:06 - would you agree that there's bigger
62:07 - support base and react our [ __ ] says yes
62:10 - yeah I would agree as well John Hanson
62:15 - says does one need to use native if a
62:19 - create react app has a responsive layout
62:22 - or does this all go further than how
62:24 - react deliver is different from desktop
62:26 - to Android iOS etc Mobile portable apps
62:31 - yes
62:32 - yeah so you could potentially do like in
62:36 - one of our previous projects we use
62:38 - create react app just for a regular
62:40 - react app and then we were able to save
62:43 - it to our desktop and run it and it
62:45 - looked a lot like a native app but it
62:47 - really wasn't a native app right so to
62:50 - get more of the benefits of a native app
62:52 - you go with react native right so in a
62:55 - if you're doing just a regular react app
63:00 - you could make it seem like it was a
63:02 - native app but really it wouldn't be the
63:05 - underlying code is still JavaScript HTML
63:07 - CSS when you're using react native the
63:10 - underlying code becomes native code for
63:14 - that device so depending on where your
63:17 - iOS or Android you know it's different
63:19 - but we're no longer talking about just
63:23 - HTML CSS JavaScript that's what you see
63:26 - when you develop but what actually ends
63:28 - up getting delivered to the device is
63:30 - the native code
63:33 - so there's definitely under the hood
63:36 - there's a big difference but then you
63:38 - also have access to more more on the
63:42 - device so I know there's the support is
63:45 - pretty good for let's say a browser like
63:48 - Chrome to access a lot of things on the
63:50 - device but it's never going to be as
63:53 - and I shouldn't say never but it's it's
63:55 - not as good released now in terms of
63:59 - having direct access to all the
64:01 - functions on a device and I imagine
64:05 - there's definitely some performance
64:07 - improvements as well when you could do
64:10 - it like that so if you if your goal is
64:13 - to build an app that people can download
64:14 - from an app store then definitely use
64:19 - react native if you're not that worried
64:22 - about that and it's something that would
64:24 - make more sense to be a website that
64:26 - could potentially also act like like an
64:29 - app you know progressive web app then
64:31 - you know you could just use normal react
64:47 - let's see alright so blake link
64:50 - something i'm not gonna have time to
64:51 - read through this but the question the
64:53 - the link for the question is react je s
64:56 - vs. JS versus static what should I do
64:59 - so I'm gonna unfortunately I think if I
65:03 - want to be done in time let's let me
65:06 - save that and if I get through the rest
65:08 - of the live chat maybe I'll try to come
65:09 - back to it if I have time
65:19 - Brooke says in that logical and error
65:22 - try wrapping the arrow function in
65:24 - parentheses okay that must have been we
65:26 - were getting errors there so as we
65:28 - worked it out sorry I didn't see that
65:29 - when I was working on it there okay
65:31 - thanks thanks for helping that Roger
65:36 - says maybe you should make a video about
65:38 - how to keep up with your videos maybe I
65:42 - will do you all think that I need to do
65:43 - that have some instructions there are
65:47 - quite a few videos now and some are
65:50 - better than others I mean I'm I'm not
65:53 - gonna lie you all are very nice about it
65:54 - but I know there's some times when I
65:57 - have a goal for a stream and it just
65:59 - doesn't happen and it's just a failure
66:02 - for the most part other times we get a
66:05 - lot of stuff done and it's really cool
66:06 - but I mean that's what it's supposed to
66:09 - be right the goal of the stream isn't
66:11 - like let's get as much done as possible
66:14 - let's let's see what it's like for
66:17 - somebody to get through their work and
66:19 - sometimes fail all right rich Rishabh
66:26 - says hey man pretty excited for the
66:28 - stream working on it from last 8 months
66:31 - really excited to see if I missed
66:33 - something as per standards cool awesome
66:45 - five Huff says good morning hey how's it
66:49 - going rishabh says I've been writing
66:53 - services on meteor and consuming
66:55 - services with react native it's great
66:57 - for middle level apps alright that's
66:59 - cool that's cool let's I'm glad to hear
67:02 - you have some experience with react
67:04 - native so maybe for future projects when
67:07 - we use it you'll be a great resource for
67:09 - us then let's see and and we'll glue
67:17 - wopo sorry if I'm mispronouncing your
67:19 - name but I know Lupo says for the pages
67:24 - using the stack navigator do you have to
67:26 - import stack navigator from react native
67:29 - navigation another quick walkthrough on
67:32 - how the screen Navigator works would be
67:33 - cool okay yeah no problem let's check
67:35 - out that navigator again so I'm going to
67:37 - go back into app touch ass and let's
67:41 - check out so right now we're importing
67:43 - tab navigator and stack navigator from
67:47 - react navigation and then what we will
67:51 - we have or - so here's our main
67:53 - navigator alright well we have a home
67:56 - screen we have a deck new question and
68:01 - quiz yes we base we just have four views
68:04 - then for home we're actually importing a
68:09 - whole nother navigator because we want
68:11 - the home view to have tabs so in that
68:13 - case we've created another navigator the
68:16 - tab navigator and within tab navigator
68:18 - we have two views list view deck whew
68:21 - alright so we have four main views and
68:25 - then we have this home screen actually
68:27 - is split up into two two different parts
68:30 - so I guess that's what five in total so
68:35 - that's how we you know we bring that in
68:37 - and now that we've done this alright and
68:40 - we've we've linked all this up here in
68:42 - app j/s which is our route component now
68:46 - when we go into something like let's go
68:49 - to list view because that's home when we
68:52 - go into this view
68:55 - we can do navigation so we can actually
69:01 - do this so we have this on press this
69:03 - props navigation navigate deck right so
69:07 - we can navigate right to that view
69:10 - called deck which we added in here so
69:14 - the view is called deck and it goes to
69:17 - the screen the component of deck view
69:21 - and and for all of our sub components we
69:24 - can do that we can just run that
69:27 - navigate this props navigation navigate
69:31 - and go right there and this isn't all we
69:33 - can do there are a lot of other options
69:34 - for for what you can do with a navigator
69:37 - but this is the one that I'm using most
69:39 - often potentially this might be the only
69:42 - way that I'm doing things because the
69:44 - apps pretty simple
69:46 - and then I happen to be passing some
69:48 - data along as well which is nice to be
69:51 - able to do that but that's optional so
69:59 - hopefully that that helps I can show you
70:02 - I guess the touch as well so am i
70:05 - bringing this in
70:14 - this times no that's my status bar then
70:18 - I guess it's enlist you
70:37 - I guess it just gets added in I was
70:39 - looking to see if there was someplace
70:41 - where we had to add in the tabs but I
70:43 - don't think we did so when we when we
70:45 - choose tab navigator and we say what we
70:48 - want each one to be so we want it to
70:51 - display as decks and new deck and then
70:53 - we give it some options
70:54 - just for styling then automatically on
70:59 - the home the home screen it just adds
71:05 - those tabs and it knows what views what
71:09 - components from here we've given it the
71:12 - list view new deck for you so you don't
71:14 - actually have to plug that in anywhere
71:16 - it's just it's it's there let's go back
71:19 - to one of those views as you can see so
71:23 - there we go there's our tabs so
71:26 - hopefully that that helped to help
71:30 - understand that like I mean that's like
71:32 - just a really simple thing it took me a
71:35 - while to read through documentation and
71:37 - watch the videos and figure out how that
71:39 - all works together so if anyone is
71:42 - having trouble getting that after my
71:43 - very quick explanation don't worry about
71:46 - it I definitely needed a little while
71:49 - for that all to sink in in the process
71:57 - Thiago says our ask do you think the
72:01 - react nanodegree is a good idea are you
72:03 - enjoying it I am enjoying it so like I
72:07 - said I'm just I'm busy so I'm not
72:09 - enjoying having to spend all that time
72:11 - away from my family but I've learned a
72:14 - lot from it so it's pushed me to do
72:18 - things that I probably would not have
72:20 - pushed myself to do so I I like it I
72:28 - think it was worth it I wish I paid the
72:32 - full price for the course and then a few
72:34 - weeks later they had a sale for Half
72:37 - Price
72:37 - so my only regret is that I didn't wait
72:40 - for the sale and get it for Half Price
72:43 - but otherwise it's been great I
72:46 - especially really like
72:48 - the code reviews so when you turn in a
72:50 - project it gets reviewed by someone and
72:52 - they go through and let you know what
72:56 - you could have done better or if you
72:57 - didn't meet some of the requirements and
72:59 - they give you suggestions so that was
73:02 - really helpful because I don't usually
73:03 - have people reviewing my code and so
73:08 - that was helpful and that really pushed
73:09 - me you know to go back and say no do it
73:12 - again that's not the best way you could
73:14 - have done it and so yeah so I definitely
73:17 - learned a lot I've come a long way
73:20 - between these streams and the help that
73:22 - you are giving me and the react
73:24 - nanodegree I learned quite a bit in
73:28 - these last you know a few months of
73:31 - doing this it's I'm pretty amazed at how
73:36 - far I've come you know in terms of my
73:40 - abilities with react in just that short
73:43 - amount of time
73:45 - so I think I'll end up doing a video
73:48 - like a review of my thoughts on the
73:50 - course when I'm done with it
73:52 - so maybe sometime in November I'll be
73:54 - able to make that and I'll put that on
73:56 - my my youtube channel and just kind of
73:59 - go through what I what I thought but as
74:01 - of right now I say it was worth it oh
74:08 - cool Alexander says the in terms of the
74:11 - pixels they are di P density independent
74:14 - pixels awesome
74:15 - whoo I figured that there was there was
74:18 - some explanation for it but thanks for
74:21 - that so the the unitless let's see were
74:26 - not so the unitless values here that
74:31 - we're using for react native are
74:33 - actually device independent pixels was
74:36 - that it density independent pixel sorry
74:38 - I'm setup density independent pixels
74:42 - let's see which table uh
74:46 - alright mujtaba
74:49 - sorry if I'm mispronouncing Apple each
74:51 - table says Jesus was sent by God to
74:53 - teach people teaching is like being a
74:56 - prophet but people do never appreciate
74:58 - many things in life though
75:00 - if the knowledge is free of charge
75:03 - great yeah actually unfortunately you're
75:09 - right if if something's free people do
75:11 - usually take it for granted and don't
75:13 - appreciate it quite as much so it's
75:16 - great that free code camp is free but
75:19 - sometimes just in talking to people no
75:21 - one's come out and said it but
75:23 - occasionally I get the feeling that
75:27 - sometimes people don't take free code
75:29 - camp as seriously as some of the other
75:32 - people that teach code for profit you
75:35 - know that that cost money when I think
75:38 - what we have is free code camp is really
75:39 - high-quality and it's it's amazing and
75:42 - I'm allowed to talk about my stream I
75:44 - mean sometimes my stream is a mess but
75:46 - the other people that that do videos and
75:48 - that work on the free code camp website
75:51 - and the forum you know and all the
75:53 - different things that free code camp has
75:54 - going on it's great quality it's amazing
75:57 - what we've been able to do just with
75:58 - volunteers and keep it all completely
76:00 - free of charge so it is really good and
76:04 - I hope people realize that in this case
76:06 - free does not mean that it's somehow
76:09 - below the quality of other things I mean
76:12 - I I think free code camp in in many
76:15 - cases is a better quality than some of
76:18 - the paid paid courses that I've taken
76:21 - and that I've seen so anyway thanks for
76:24 - that much table I appreciate you saying
76:27 - that
76:29 - let's see Saucon says redux ugh it
76:33 - doesn't make sense to me the generator
76:35 - thing looks so high-level stuff would
76:37 - you use thunks saga observer or anything
76:41 - else I've used thunk so thunks pretty
76:45 - simple I've used it I have not had
76:47 - experience with saga yet so I I'll
76:51 - probably end up working with it at some
76:53 - point I just kind of like to know what
76:55 - it's like and what the differences
76:56 - between thunk and saga but if you're
77:00 - having trouble with saga I would check
77:01 - out funk it seemed it's really simple to
77:04 - use at least in my experience it's
77:11 - I should ask what mirroring software I'm
77:13 - using it's called
77:14 - visor let me see if I can bring it up so
77:18 - yeah I don't know if you can see that
77:19 - now you can't see that on the bottom
77:22 - uh-huh because my my thing some way let
77:25 - me move this oops let me move this you
77:29 - can see a little bit so visor that's the
77:33 - icon there I guess that's really small
77:35 - but it's it's called it's what is it V Y
77:39 - SOR visor
77:45 - let's see let me see the time oh man I
77:49 - got a rep let me go really quickly
77:50 - through the rest of the live chat and
77:51 - then I got a go to my meeting I can't be
77:55 - late to this meeting the head of my
77:56 - department is going to be in this one
77:57 - and my boss will be in it so definitely
78:01 - got to finish up quickly here so I'm
78:04 - gonna skip the comments so sorry I won't
78:06 - be able to read all the comments but I
78:07 - do want to get to the questions Schlow
78:11 - bird says how do I get an overview of
78:13 - all the JavaScript frameworks I just use
78:14 - basic js4 now and I don't know which
78:17 - with with which frameworks I should
78:19 - start
78:20 - I don't program for a living I don't
78:23 - know that there's a resource off the top
78:26 - of my head I don't know a resource that
78:27 - good there's an overview I imagine it
78:30 - probably exists somewhere so I'll tell
78:34 - you what send me a message on Twitter or
78:37 - something and then I'll send if I can
78:39 - find something I'll send it to you if I
78:44 - had more time in the stream I try to
78:46 - look something up right now so sorry
78:48 - about that but coming back for another
78:51 - stream or send me a message or something
78:52 - on Twitter and I'll try to help you out
78:55 - as best I can
78:57 - oh cool harsh it says there's a material
79:01 - design framework for react native so
79:04 - it's react native material design github
79:07 - I Oh awesome that sounds really cool
79:10 - like I said I'm not gonna do it now
79:12 - because I need to turn this in the
79:14 - deadlines almost here but after I turn
79:16 - it in if I do some extra work I
79:19 - I may end up using that okay all right
79:24 - hard should I see what you're saying
79:25 - about the SendGrid keys I'll test that
79:28 - out later on maybe after my meeting
79:34 - okay harsh it's asking about how to find
79:39 - freelance work yeah so like I don't have
79:42 - time to answer right now cuz I gotta go
79:44 - to my meeting but hard [ __ ] ask me that
79:46 - send me a message on Twitter or ask me
79:49 - in tomorrow stream and we can go over
79:51 - that in more depth I do have some advice
79:53 - I used to freelance for a few for like
79:55 - three years so I definitely have some
79:57 - advice on that so I'm happy to help you
80:00 - out with that
80:21 - world's s what's the disadvantage of PHP
80:24 - I don't work that much with PHP but one
80:29 - thing that I've noticed with PHP that I
80:30 - don't really like and I don't I haven't
80:33 - that looked at a lot but I have a
80:34 - co-worker that's dealt with it a lot and
80:35 - it's been a problem is the different
80:37 - versions of PHP don't always work well
80:40 - together so he's worked on some legacy
80:43 - projects where he can't upgrade to newer
80:45 - versions of things because of issues
80:48 - with different PHP versions supporting
80:50 - different things so it's kind of he's
80:53 - kind of stuck and I'm afraid at times it
80:55 - can be a security issue because he has
80:58 - to run things in different versions of
81:00 - PHP we've inherited this you know this
81:02 - old code and so we have to keep
81:05 - different versions running and try to
81:07 - keep track of what will work on these
81:08 - different versions I don't really like
81:11 - that it seems like with JavaScript
81:13 - there's not that much of an issue like
81:16 - everything's always backwards compatible
81:18 - at least I haven't really run into
81:21 - anything like that so that's the at
81:23 - least for me the only did like bad thing
81:25 - I've run into with PHP and maybe there's
81:27 - a way around that and I just don't know
81:29 - it because I'm not I don't use PHP that
81:32 - much but otherwise you know and I know
81:35 - people that they make good money you
81:38 - know doing things with PHP and they do
81:39 - really cool stuff with it so so I don't
81:44 - think there's a problem using it Harshit
81:50 - says we you stream react native tomorrow
81:52 - maybe it depends on how much I get done
81:55 - on this project today I'm gonna work on
81:57 - it
81:57 - later on today so we'll see if I get it
82:00 - finished and I turn it in
82:01 - I may not stream about it if I if I
82:04 - don't then I probably will stream so
82:08 - maybe the answers may be all right so I
82:12 - got through everything sorry I had to
82:14 - skip over a lot of the comments and I
82:15 - couldn't give as good of answers as I
82:17 - normally do I guess that I'm just
82:19 - running out of time so I will be back
82:21 - tomorrow most likely in case I'm crazy
82:23 - unless something crazy happens I'll be
82:26 - around the same time around 2 p.m.
82:28 - Eastern time tomorrow and thank you so
82:31 - much for all your your help during this
82:33 - and a lot of great discussion in a live
82:36 - chat I love when that happens you're
82:38 - helping each other out and helping me
82:39 - out so it's just awesome but anyway I
82:43 - have to go and go to a meeting now so
82:47 - I'll be back tomorrow and until then
82:50 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody and welcome to live streaming with Jesse a live coding with Jesse and today we're gonna do something different I thought we'd do some react native so I have a react native project that I'm nearly finished with and I don't know that it's gonna work out how I wanted it to so I anticipated doing some work with Redux and react native but here's my problem I don't know if you can see this we make it a bit bigger I was trying to update my packages and it's it's just hanging I can't I tried restarting my computer and doing it again so I'm not sure if this is gonna work like that but what we can do is we can do some other work so right now I'm running two different branches I'm running a the master branch which has all the same functionality but it doesn't use Redux and then I have a Redux branch so what we should be able to do if if this won't work is just switch back to the master branch and then work off of that branch and and everything should still work fine so just to introduce you to what we're working on this is a flashcard app this is the final project for the react nano degree from Udacity so this is how I'm implementing that project I'm sure there's a lot of different ways that it could be done basically what it does is it lets you create decks of flashcards and then you can quiz yourself on them so run it through quickly so these are the decks I can click on one of these decks and we can start the quiz and I could answer obviously you see the u.s. they'll need some work so I click the first one to be correct the second one will do in correct us to show how the grading works basically you make the the question and the answer and you can toggle back and forth between the question and the answer and then once you're done it gives you the score in this case we got a 50% and then you can also add cards so this I don't think will work right now but let's just try to add one yeah see it's not going to work because this branch is trying to use redux to do this but all the redux packages are not installed so let's dismiss that go back and you're also able to add a new deck this is not gonna work most likely as well let's submit that oh you know what I don't think I hope that went up to redux yet so that didn't throw an error yet but that's how it's supposed to work all right yeah this still is not working so let's just cancel that for now and switch over to our other branch okay I do want to probably have to restart this there we go okay let's run yarn quickly in this branch I'd like to at least test to see if it was something I was trying to do on the branch or if it's something wrong with this computer we'll let that go for a minute just to see see what's going on but let's check out a little bit of the code they make this a bit bigger and let me say hey to everyone in the live chat before we start to put it it's uh Nance and says you broke it yes I somehow I broke the Arne I don't I don't know what I did alright see that's not that's still not working so let's just quit that and let's refresh hmm maybe I'll restart the server this actually the first time I've tried to run this on this computer I've been developing this on my my laptop so it's probably why I'm having problems I didn't it didn't allow enough time before the stream to test everything out but here's some of the code that we're working with and I guess since we haven't ever worked with react native on this stream I'll do a little intro it's going to be really familiar if you're if you've been watching what we're doing with react but there are a few differences so I'm just going to run through the differences quickly just to make it a little bit easier to to understand what's going on and why we had to do things a little differently let's see dragon hunter said am I too late no no I haven't said yeah and nobody's too late yet we haven't haven't really started anything let's see yes I am using using Adam okay heart should also asked about your PR Arshad I'm testing that pool request so I've downloaded it to a different branch and I'm testing it I think I ended up using the service that you recommended the M lab setting up a MongoDB database and that was all working I think my problem still is the email thing so the was a email mail trap for some reason it still doesn't work I think you had mentioned something about possibly the port's being blocked by my network I'm thinking that that's the problem because I've had issues before with ports in the past so I know the the ports are kind of on lockdown here so what I'm gonna do and this is why I decided not to livestream that because I'm not going to try to do any work on that project until I'm gonna go home on my home network where I have more control over what ports or blocks I'm gonna test everything out there hopefully it all works out then and then if it works out I'll merge it all just gonna have to come up with some other way to do testing I guess from you know from work from my office so anyway that's why I haven't merged yet and that's why we're not working on it right now so hopefully at least don't know if it still doesn't work at home then maybe it's something else but from everything that I've tried doing with it it's it's probably a port thing so I'll have more info about that tomorrow alright so let me go no no beer it so I forget to shave yeah I have not Harsha is asking change support 25 I changed I tried port 25 I tried port for something whatever the other one you recommended was I tried all this porch nothing worked so yes I'll just I'll try it out at home Trieste if I'm drunk I am NOT drunk now I haven't been any alcohol today actually for a while I don't remember the last time I drank okay let's let me start my timer and okay so we're just going to go over some code first and then maybe we'll try to do some updates maybe with with the UI so sorry about the misleading title really did want to work with with redux but and so I figure out what's going on with yarn we could do work with redux and reasonably expect that it would do what we want it to do but I have no way to test it so let's check this out first of all well we'll start at the beginning here with our app dot J's file obviously you know we make this a bit bigger for you all so the setup for package.json is is actually should look pretty similar to any other react project and then I've added in our standard linting that we've been using on all our projects with with prettier and standard Jass you notice a little bit something's a little different instead of react strips we have react native scripts right so everything is is going to say you know react native instead we're using expo which it brings in expo does a lot of stuff you'll see us bringing in some components and things from expo we're importing it in various parts of our app it also comes with an app that you can download and then allows you to test out the app on your phone and debug and everything you know right there so let's see all right so not a lot going on with the package.json let's check out our app j/s okay so we're bringing in you know react just like normal we have let's go over some of the navigation because now the navigation is probably one of the biggest differences between react and back native that I've dealt with so far so if you notice we're bringing in we're not using react router we're using react navigation we're bringing in a tab navigator and a stack navigator so the the navigation is definitely see where I'm pulling this in okay so here's the the first part I have a tab navigator and now this obviously these are the tabs at the top or if if you're on Android the tabs are at the top if you're on iOS the tabs at the bottom one of the cool things about react native is the there are some standard components that get rendered differently based on whether you're on iOS or Android so it'll use like the native styling options for those which is really cool you don't have to worry about doing that yourself so in this case we added some some tabs we have a list view tab and a deck view tab this is really straightforward right we have our screen right this is the label tab our label this is what the user will see and then we say what component is going to render so you can see all our views over here our react components so we just tell the Navigator what component to display as the view when you click on that particular tab so super easy notice we do import this so it's very similar to react router in those terms but we have we also have some options so you can style your tab bar okay just your basic basic options colors and things like that but then we also have the stack navigator and think of the stack navigator like if you were to click on buttons within the app you wouldn't want the views to change right but you don't want every single view to be on your tabs that you would have to weigh too many tabs so this is where all the rest of them the rest will come into play so we're bringing in the tabs here so we're actually so we've we've named this tab navigator tabs right we saved it to that constant so we're pulling all of this in and then in addition to that we're adding a screen for what we call it work for a deck view our new question view our quiz view and you saw all those views when we did the demo a few minutes ago right so that's how navigation works so some elements are familiar but that was definitely something I had to grab my head around you know to understand I was coming from you know browser mode using you know react router so a little bit different for that let's see as far as this page is concerned I think that's all you don't want to go over maybe this since it's this here we'll talk about this we have this style sheet dot create and you'll notice I guess it's hard to see on this base we'll go to another page here so maybe it's a little bit more obvious where's your stuff there we go so we're using style sheet create we don't have to do it this way but there's a performance improvement if you add your Styles in like this and then you know this is just a JavaScript object and then we can put it in here so on our view we have style we just have style style container so then everything under container is applied to this component right you'll notice there are no there's no indication of pixels or anything like that everything in react native is just just straight numbers okay so they don't you know we don't have like VH or pixels or eeehm whatever you want to will you normally use in the browser obviously we're still doing since this is a JavaScript object we're camel casing everything we're actually importing colors so we have a color CAS file and we're just bringing in the colors from there so we have purple and white coming in let's see I have just some some test data up here so this will actually be gone in the the production version of this app but I needed some test data to work on before I had everything set up and working okay we're using async storage instead of local storage so there isn't local storage on your your device the equivalent would be async storage depending on your device whether it's iOS or Android the database that's holding that in the background will be different but you don't have to worry about that a sink storage takes care of all that and you have a simple API to use that so for now it's just get item right so we're safe everything is just saved as key value pairs so all of our our decks are saved with under the key decks right and then so in this particular case we're just getting everything all of them and then we're just looping through them all let's see there's oh okay the only other difference you'll see we don't have divs or P tags right we have views so instead of a div you're probably going to want to use view wherever you would normally use a div and instead of a P tag you want to use text that's just in general so you would never just have text right normally you could have just text inside of a view that isn't wrapped in a component but you can't do that in react native you have to have any text wrapped inside of a text tag so that's that's probably the other really big difference so probably the way you do routing and then the views and text instead of divs and P tags probably the biggest biggest differences I guess I could show on let me show one that has input so you can see with the inputs it's actually not that it's not that different from what you would normally see the cool thing though is we don't have to worry as much about styling inputs so by default depending on what you're using you get that default device style so so that's kind of nice you can of course style it however you want but if you if you didn't want to worry about that you get default styling which is cool all right so let's let's actually do some some coding with this and let me see how much time I have I do want to answer questions I know I see the live chat is a lot going on in there right now so I will as soon as this pommeroy time is up I'll go and answer some questions and then we'll see how much time we have I have a meeting in about an hour so I can't go any longer than that and I need to get I need to get some data ready for the meeting so probably need to end no later than like 45 minutes from now okay looks like my app froze on my my device so I'm gonna restart it so we can actually see what's going on well that's well that's working let's go back over here and we let's see okay here we go all right so it's back we're back here let's um let's take a look at the UI and see where we could have some improvements here one thing that I've noticed probably could be improvement is uh we need these titles need to be bigger and uniform throughout right now they're not uniform throughout so we can we also need that let's add a card because a couple of cards so that we can see the UI so that should be good but your notice right now here's my biggest problem the UI doesn't automatically update when you add a card so right now the data is there so the data for those two new cards that we just put in is there in a sink storage so but it's not reflected yet so what I'd have to do then is reload and when we reload you'll see it's it'll be reflected see so now we have our two cards okay so now we can see our quiz all right so we have our question and answer and we have this is the second question right so so that works now but what I need to have happen and this is why I was starting to implement Redux I mean also it's the data is a little bit cleaner with Redux anyway but I wanted to try to get that automatic refresh but since we can't really get Redux working right now we're gonna put that on hold and instead we're going to work a little bit on the UI so here's what I'd like to do these buttons are way too big in proportion to the other text on the page so the text inside the buttons as well as the title and everything so let's just do some style and lesson react native the stylings not it's not that different but it is a little bit odd to get used to a unitless styling okay so we're we knew we're deck view okay so we're in our deck view and let's go down to our styles and let's check out our font size I think we can definitely for our title we can double that font size and I think that'll still look look pretty good our number I think the numbers fine for right now that's that this area right here and you can see we've already seen since we have my device is connected to my computer right now and so it's Auto refreshing every time we change something which is nice so this is a lot nicer size I think I'll stick with that for now and let's maybe adjust these a bit I want to keep the buttons large enough so that they can comfortably be clicked by users even if the user happens to have a large thumb so I'm hesitant to make the buttons any smaller but I would like to make the proportions a bit nicer so let's check out our button let's see how we have this here so our text let's make another another we're gonna it only this works like a class but you know what I'm saying it's not really a class since this is just a JavaScript object that we're gonna call this button text and I call this button text I guess I don't have I don't have space between these and let's make the button text let's see what 20 looks like I think it might be a bit too big but we're gonna try it out so we'll go font size 20 and we'll leave the color alone right now let's see what this looks like oops we didn't put it I didn't apply it so here's what we need to do and that's not a comma so let's take this this text we're actually going to use we're going to apply it to both of these and we need to add style and let's go with styles dot button text okay now we'll save that and see how it looks okay not bad not bad so you can see this I think that that font size is more appropriate given the size of our buttons okay not bad I still don't really love the proportions though oh it would probably better if we had a title of this deck that it was more reasonable so let's add a deck let's see okay that's a little bit bigger I'm gonna submit that and once again we actually have to manually reload this to get it to show up here we go here's our test deck okay this is not bad not bad okay let's let's check out our whoops Oh interesting I have to do something like that maybe if there are no cards then let's disable that start quiz how about that let's add that in right now because you know we don't really want that behavior so I don't know if you saw that but when I click start quiz since there's no cards that automatically takes me to the score screen and obviously we can't get a score if there are no cards so let's change that so right now on that button to start the quiz we have on press and then we navigate to the quiz but what we want to do instead is check first to see if there are any cards and if there aren't cards we don't want to navigate so let's remove this yeah let's remove this and we're going to bring it up here that's and the navigation so I don't know about you but before I started react native I was afraid that it would just be way you know just so much more different that I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to to catch on very quickly but you could see I mean this is very much like what we what we're used to so let's see we're gonna need to put let's let's make this so that it can handle our clicks on both buttons so what we need to bring in then is the view and the deck and so here what we can bring in there is oops I don't know why get rid of that what did I call that handle navigation navigation and what did we call it we quiz so that you was quiz and then we did bring in where did we get that from oh okay we're already bringing in deck here so okay and let's copy this and for this one we're going to bring in new question so if you notice here normally we would put an on click here for a button but it's it's on press for react native which makes sense we're not not clicking you know this is all touchscreen alright let's see question you need to put in view and then yeah this should be fine the way it is let's save that and we'll click it let's see if it works whoops no she's not the fine whoops I didn't say all right let's chat again my addition is not a function what did I do wrong okay now it's working all right great so it's working and it looks like it's taking us to the right place and it's passing the data we can doublecheck that it's faster data by going to something actually does have data yeah and those are the right question oops sorry I didn't realize I didn't know this on the screen I'll do this again this we can see this one it is passing the right card data and it's obviously going to the right spot so now that we've implemented that we can say at least for this on press so we're gonna say if my shirts yes we're gonna say if deck questions dot length is greater than zero okay I've had questions length greater than zero I didn't want to deck all right let's see if I work no we're ready okay I'm getting an error be so against something my whoops let's try to make this irregular otherwise no questions all right let's make this oops all right so basically what I want to do with this there's no questions is indicate to the user that they need to add a question so for right now right now that's gonna be a console.log which obviously isn't gonna help the user that much on a device but at least this will remind me what I intend to do with this in case we don't get get to it during the stream all right so my timer is up so let me set my fiveminute timer and oh there we go getting more useful feedback here that's my old code very uh there we go okay so that I keep forgetting you can't see my screen okay so I'm on this test deck now and I'm hitting the start quiz button you can see that feedback there and it's not doing anything but if we go to our other deck where we do have cards we hit start quiz and it does work so that's what we've that's what we've done here is just made sure that you can't start the quiz unless there are actually cards so the next step which we may or may not do on this dream would be to add some sort of visual feedback to the user to remind them that you need to add a card first okay so let me go let me restart that fiveminute timer since I went back and did some work let's see I'm gonna go through mmm questions alright let me go through the question just see what's here we may or may not do another Pomodoro session since I do have a meeting coming up soon all right so I'm gonna scroll up and try to work my way down through as many questions as I can oops you guys can see that but or not also forgot to mention this but there's a live stream going on now from the chrome Developers Conference so if check that out I was watching it a little bit of it earlier and some interesting stuff so I don't know what the times are for everything that I think is going on pretty much all day today paka says i'm trying to master react before going on redux what do you guys think I don't know that you need to master react before getting to before getting to Redux yeah I mean if you end up working on a project project where it makes sense to use Redux I'd say go for it because there are definitely some times where Redux is going to help you significantly and keeping your app keeping the dataflow on your app more sensible so if you're building absolute that they don't really need it then don't worry about it but it's a good thing to know so I mean it's not the only option either right there there are other options for handling your data other than Redux so you may not need to use Redux you could go with what it mob X which I have not used yet but in general when a question is like do I need to master this before doing this my answer is almost always no like you don't need to just learn learn what you need to do for that whatever makes the most sense for your projects and it's not it's not really an either/or thing with these different technologies you can learn them both as you go alright hey Sebastian says update yarn ok cool why I did not try to update yarn yet so I would do that to try to fix my my issues with this dragon on just said a broken yarn still faster than NTM not in this case although I've heard the newer versions of NPM are pretty fast too I haven't seen data as to which one's faster but I think it's better ok Harshit says clean clean the cache and yarn ok I want to try that three thinks I sound drunk on the stream so do I actually sound drunk on the stream I don't know you know how it is when you hear your own voice recorded it always sounds weird to you so my voice always sounds weird I'm not a good judge I guess okay actually let me try this now since we'll try to clean that out and see if that will work Harshit says which version of yarn are you using one per point one cause problems for me yeah you know what I think I'm using a later version of yarn on my laptop because I just I recently upgraded iron on my laptop like sometime within the last two weeks or so so I'm definitely using an older version here so I mean let's give it a shot see maybe maybe something will happen here but okay see Z ohm boy says why do you use Pomodoro app what are the benefits Harshit mentions it helps to manage time and track work yeah definitely so in this case on the stream I also use it to help me to break up the stream and remember to stop coding and check out the live chat answer some questions and then also to remember to stop answering questions go back to the live chat but I do use it even when I'm not streaming and it does help it helps break up the work into manageable chunks keep me on track and keep me taking regular breaks because often it's it's easy for me at least to keep working on a problem and I'm stuck and I keep trying things and trying things and it doesn't work but if I step back and take a break even if it's just for a few minutes for some reason my brain just it needs that little break and then when I come back to it I can i often either solve the problem or I realize you know what there are better things for me to do right now this isn't really a main issue you know I may have been working really hard on some side thing that wasn't essential for the product to launch so I like that little break it really helps I find I'm a lot more productive when I'm using the Pomodoro timer let's see well based on the amount of questions I'm seeing in the live chat I think I should try to get through the questions now and not hey all right you got through it all awesome okay so if you didn't see what just happened there if any of you ever run into a similar problem where yarn just is hanging and not working try yarn cache clean as your command Harshit just mentioned that and thank you for that advice and that worked for me so everything installed now I would want to double check and test this on the other branch as well but we saw I was having the problem on both branches so since it worked on this branch I'm assuming that'll work on the other branch I'm not going to test it right now because we still have changes here that I want to commit first anyway so cool that'll work so maybe I would actually like to have everything finished and turn this project in today so I don't know if we'll work on this more on the stream it depends on whether or not my project passes the review so we'll see if it doesn't pass and I have more work to do maybe we'll do another stream on this otherwise I'll have to implement all the Redux stuff on my own but in any case whenever the project passes then I can I can show you on the ship might not do a whole stream about it but I can show you the finished product and of course it's on my github profile so you can check out the code whenever you want all right so let me just run through the rest of these questions here let's see okay dragon hunter says set in 8vd with android studio why Expo I'm not sure about the first part of that statement but it why use Expo instead of Android studio I'm using Expo because that's how so within the Udacity course that's how we were taught to do app development so I could use Android studio but but this was just the the quickest way to get everything set up alright see the whisper in your ears says that's that's actually the name says hey let me ask you I've been trying to choose full stack frame work and everything came down to meteor or sales apparently there is nothing more dominant these days but people say meteor is dead now Harshit says meteor is not that dead dragon hunter says if pearl is not dead yet then nothing is that I guess the whisper in the ears is kind of weird because meteor has so many stars in github so let's see yet to be honest with you I've seen really cool things done with meteor I don't know about numbers as far as how how many people still use meteor if it's if it is dying I don't really know but from what I've seen built with meteor it's it it was certainly very capable so generally I don't really do full stack stuff here I'm more frontend although we do include some backend stuff when we need to so I don't know that I'm the best person to give you advice on and it's our framework to choose let's see but maybe if somebody here watching is stack or has an opinion that way you know please share that in the live chat okay all right sory says guys you're wasting your time this is not realistic go elsewhere good luck okay so not sure what would I did that upset three but I guess the streams not for everybody see I'm not sure what he means by realistic I mean this this actually really is a project that I'm doing so I it's realistic for me this is how I work so let's see a harsh it says in response I have already cloned and tested the app yesterday so I'm not wasting my time let's see okay so the whisper New Year's is saying it's still talking about the question of a fullstack framework is saying JavaScript doesn't have a dominant stack like like laravel for PHP Harshit says use pug with express it's really powerful okay Harshit says it gives flexibility okay so I'm not gonna read everything but there's a debate here about whether or not Express is capable in the same way as a fullstack framework is a dominant framework so the debate seems to be from well you can add things to Express to basically do everything that you want it allows a lot of flexibility like that but on the other hand it's not like ready to go you know right off the bat to do everything you need so let's see somebody's mentions happy use H API it's a framework I've never used that so I can't comment on it shree mentions do you know what async async' EO is that a sink that supposed to be a sink I don't really know no I'm I'm not I'm not aware of what a sink EO is Jamal says is this the Udacity project yes it is the Udacity project so it's it's project three of that react nano degree for Udacity so the it's the final project so as soon as I'm done with this and it gets accepted then I'm officially done with the nano degree and and I passed so really excited if you all been watching you know like it's been taking up a lot of my time doing the the nano degree so I learned a lot through this but I'm definitely excited to not spend all my my Saturdays and doing this I'd much rather to have some time to spend with the kids and I'm sure they would rather let me spend time with them as well let's see all right sir II said you really can't do this any more than five minutes I'm not sure what I was doing at the time when when you said that tree so I guess if you could elaborate maybe I'll answer but I can't when was that 153 yeah I'm not sure what I was working on at that time sure he also says you can't do it yeah I don't remember what I was working on at the time hard should ask if I need a PR in this project two already cloned and tested it actually hard should I appreciate the offer but I don't feel comfortable taking any PRS for this project since it is for a course so I need to I need to do it all myself since it's for course otherwise as you all know I'm perfectly you know happy to collaborate on projects I'm not I'm not one that needs all the control over things I realized that you all bring a lot of expertise to the table so I'm quick to admit whenever I need to take the help of someone else but in this case since it is for a class and I'm being graded in a sense on this I'm gonna have to figure it out on my own but again thanks for the offer I appreciate that and then certainly after I turn it in if we want to keep working on this I'm definitely open for that if we want to try to make it better and actually launch it as an app that's cool too I think I'll probably still work on it I'd like to maybe have my kids be able to use it to help them study so that's something I'm definitely definitely open to rook says those unitless CSS values are pixels can you use REM as well I'm not sure if they're exactly pixels I don't recall in that part of the course when they explained that I don't recall exactly what they are so I don't know maybe somebody knows but I don't know if they translate exactly to what what pixels would be let's say like if you are in a browser on a mobile device I don't think you can't so ATS also about using a.m. or REM I don't think you can use any units I actually haven't tried but I'm pretty sure that you you're not supposed to use units with that so if you didn't if you don't remember that part it when we're doing the CSS or the styles for in react native there are no units so normally you would see pixels or EMS or something here but we don't use units all right harsh it says I guess the unit is relative to device yeah I think that's how it works it all depends on the I guess the device pixel ratio well and that I don't know there it's hard to talk about it without a unit right but I think it does depend on the the resolution of the screen and size of the screen let's see harsh that says hey Jessie did you hear about Adam IDE check out Adam that I oh yeah actually I I saw something about the Adam IDE I may end up checking out at some point so we'll see maybe I'll test it out we could use on a stream or something when I first heard about it I thought I didn't really need any of that functionality but it would still be cool maybe to take a look at and just just to show everyone John Hanson says the start quiz button looks wider odd yeah let me reload see if it'll work there we go yeah let's check that out actually you're right to start quiz button does look wider interesting I'll have to check that out later on to see if it if it really is wider I mean there's there's yeah it is odd yeah I definitely want them to be the same I don't want one to be wider than the other I may change how these buttons look as well right now at this point I'm not as worried about the Styles because I just need to get this turned in before the deadline so unfortunately it's not gonna look awesome but I just need to fit all the project requirements so I can always style it later on save some debate about between view and reacts which I'm kind of skipping over a bit to look for more questions okay Blake says if I learned react what I also know almost all of react native well it depends on how much you mean by almost all you would know a lot you would know a lot of it so the concepts are the same right so the idea that you have these components that get rendered into something else right that's that's entirely the same but in terms of like specifically how you do things right there are some differences but I mean I pointed out to me at least the big differences for me and learning it and you see they weren't really that big of a deal so I didn't think it was that big of a stretch to move from react to react native okay now I don't know if I went even deeper and try to do something more complex than just a flash card app maybe I would run into some more issues but I think going for me at least going from not using react to do web development to using react was a much harder transition than transitioning from react to react native so that was just my experience but it just didn't seem that hard to translate the concepts into building something you know for phone than doing web development so Blake s so what do you think I should learn yes so Blake I think to be honest with you it depends on what your goals are for for learning right I mean learn whatever you enjoy you know or learn what you need to do for the projects that you're doing but react right now is growing it's continuing to grow there are a lot of react jobs the payfor react developers is nice so if you enjoy working with react I said go for it I mean are there alternatives that are popular yeah there are alternatives that are popular but I I just I see react more and more in job listings so if your goal is to get a job doing this type of thing then you know it would be I don't think it would be wrong to go with react but it's just a pow mean if you check out to you and you really like you there are jobs for view developers if you check out angular and you love that then they're still you know there are a lot of jobs for that so definitely test out different things but I think you'd be fine if you did want to go with react I think you'd be fine from a from the standpoint of having marketable skills all right I got to keep an eye on the time here okay so I'm good probably about like 10 more minutes I'm going to try to get through the rest of these questions I think I can do it Blake asks well he's asking Harshit would you agree that there's bigger support base and react our [ __ ] says yes yeah I would agree as well John Hanson says does one need to use native if a create react app has a responsive layout or does this all go further than how react deliver is different from desktop to Android iOS etc Mobile portable apps yes yeah so you could potentially do like in one of our previous projects we use create react app just for a regular react app and then we were able to save it to our desktop and run it and it looked a lot like a native app but it really wasn't a native app right so to get more of the benefits of a native app you go with react native right so in a if you're doing just a regular react app you could make it seem like it was a native app but really it wouldn't be the underlying code is still JavaScript HTML CSS when you're using react native the underlying code becomes native code for that device so depending on where your iOS or Android you know it's different but we're no longer talking about just HTML CSS JavaScript that's what you see when you develop but what actually ends up getting delivered to the device is the native code so there's definitely under the hood there's a big difference but then you also have access to more more on the device so I know there's the support is pretty good for let's say a browser like Chrome to access a lot of things on the device but it's never going to be as and I shouldn't say never but it's it's not as good released now in terms of having direct access to all the functions on a device and I imagine there's definitely some performance improvements as well when you could do it like that so if you if your goal is to build an app that people can download from an app store then definitely use react native if you're not that worried about that and it's something that would make more sense to be a website that could potentially also act like like an app you know progressive web app then you know you could just use normal react let's see alright so blake link something i'm not gonna have time to read through this but the question the the link for the question is react je s vs. JS versus static what should I do so I'm gonna unfortunately I think if I want to be done in time let's let me save that and if I get through the rest of the live chat maybe I'll try to come back to it if I have time Brooke says in that logical and error try wrapping the arrow function in parentheses okay that must have been we were getting errors there so as we worked it out sorry I didn't see that when I was working on it there okay thanks thanks for helping that Roger says maybe you should make a video about how to keep up with your videos maybe I will do you all think that I need to do that have some instructions there are quite a few videos now and some are better than others I mean I'm I'm not gonna lie you all are very nice about it but I know there's some times when I have a goal for a stream and it just doesn't happen and it's just a failure for the most part other times we get a lot of stuff done and it's really cool but I mean that's what it's supposed to be right the goal of the stream isn't like let's get as much done as possible let's let's see what it's like for somebody to get through their work and sometimes fail all right rich Rishabh says hey man pretty excited for the stream working on it from last 8 months really excited to see if I missed something as per standards cool awesome five Huff says good morning hey how's it going rishabh says I've been writing services on meteor and consuming services with react native it's great for middle level apps alright that's cool that's cool let's I'm glad to hear you have some experience with react native so maybe for future projects when we use it you'll be a great resource for us then let's see and and we'll glue wopo sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name but I know Lupo says for the pages using the stack navigator do you have to import stack navigator from react native navigation another quick walkthrough on how the screen Navigator works would be cool okay yeah no problem let's check out that navigator again so I'm going to go back into app touch ass and let's check out so right now we're importing tab navigator and stack navigator from react navigation and then what we will we have or so here's our main navigator alright well we have a home screen we have a deck new question and quiz yes we base we just have four views then for home we're actually importing a whole nother navigator because we want the home view to have tabs so in that case we've created another navigator the tab navigator and within tab navigator we have two views list view deck whew alright so we have four main views and then we have this home screen actually is split up into two two different parts so I guess that's what five in total so that's how we you know we bring that in and now that we've done this alright and we've we've linked all this up here in app j/s which is our route component now when we go into something like let's go to list view because that's home when we go into this view we can do navigation so we can actually do this so we have this on press this props navigation navigate deck right so we can navigate right to that view called deck which we added in here so the view is called deck and it goes to the screen the component of deck view and and for all of our sub components we can do that we can just run that navigate this props navigation navigate and go right there and this isn't all we can do there are a lot of other options for for what you can do with a navigator but this is the one that I'm using most often potentially this might be the only way that I'm doing things because the apps pretty simple and then I happen to be passing some data along as well which is nice to be able to do that but that's optional so hopefully that that helps I can show you I guess the touch as well so am i bringing this in this times no that's my status bar then I guess it's enlist you I guess it just gets added in I was looking to see if there was someplace where we had to add in the tabs but I don't think we did so when we when we choose tab navigator and we say what we want each one to be so we want it to display as decks and new deck and then we give it some options just for styling then automatically on the home the home screen it just adds those tabs and it knows what views what components from here we've given it the list view new deck for you so you don't actually have to plug that in anywhere it's just it's it's there let's go back to one of those views as you can see so there we go there's our tabs so hopefully that that helped to help understand that like I mean that's like just a really simple thing it took me a while to read through documentation and watch the videos and figure out how that all works together so if anyone is having trouble getting that after my very quick explanation don't worry about it I definitely needed a little while for that all to sink in in the process Thiago says our ask do you think the react nanodegree is a good idea are you enjoying it I am enjoying it so like I said I'm just I'm busy so I'm not enjoying having to spend all that time away from my family but I've learned a lot from it so it's pushed me to do things that I probably would not have pushed myself to do so I I like it I think it was worth it I wish I paid the full price for the course and then a few weeks later they had a sale for Half Price so my only regret is that I didn't wait for the sale and get it for Half Price but otherwise it's been great I especially really like the code reviews so when you turn in a project it gets reviewed by someone and they go through and let you know what you could have done better or if you didn't meet some of the requirements and they give you suggestions so that was really helpful because I don't usually have people reviewing my code and so that was helpful and that really pushed me you know to go back and say no do it again that's not the best way you could have done it and so yeah so I definitely learned a lot I've come a long way between these streams and the help that you are giving me and the react nanodegree I learned quite a bit in these last you know a few months of doing this it's I'm pretty amazed at how far I've come you know in terms of my abilities with react in just that short amount of time so I think I'll end up doing a video like a review of my thoughts on the course when I'm done with it so maybe sometime in November I'll be able to make that and I'll put that on my my youtube channel and just kind of go through what I what I thought but as of right now I say it was worth it oh cool Alexander says the in terms of the pixels they are di P density independent pixels awesome whoo I figured that there was there was some explanation for it but thanks for that so the the unitless let's see were not so the unitless values here that we're using for react native are actually device independent pixels was that it density independent pixel sorry I'm setup density independent pixels let's see which table uh alright mujtaba sorry if I'm mispronouncing Apple each table says Jesus was sent by God to teach people teaching is like being a prophet but people do never appreciate many things in life though if the knowledge is free of charge great yeah actually unfortunately you're right if if something's free people do usually take it for granted and don't appreciate it quite as much so it's great that free code camp is free but sometimes just in talking to people no one's come out and said it but occasionally I get the feeling that sometimes people don't take free code camp as seriously as some of the other people that teach code for profit you know that that cost money when I think what we have is free code camp is really highquality and it's it's amazing and I'm allowed to talk about my stream I mean sometimes my stream is a mess but the other people that that do videos and that work on the free code camp website and the forum you know and all the different things that free code camp has going on it's great quality it's amazing what we've been able to do just with volunteers and keep it all completely free of charge so it is really good and I hope people realize that in this case free does not mean that it's somehow below the quality of other things I mean I I think free code camp in in many cases is a better quality than some of the paid paid courses that I've taken and that I've seen so anyway thanks for that much table I appreciate you saying that let's see Saucon says redux ugh it doesn't make sense to me the generator thing looks so highlevel stuff would you use thunks saga observer or anything else I've used thunk so thunks pretty simple I've used it I have not had experience with saga yet so I I'll probably end up working with it at some point I just kind of like to know what it's like and what the differences between thunk and saga but if you're having trouble with saga I would check out funk it seemed it's really simple to use at least in my experience it's I should ask what mirroring software I'm using it's called visor let me see if I can bring it up so yeah I don't know if you can see that now you can't see that on the bottom uhhuh because my my thing some way let me move this oops let me move this you can see a little bit so visor that's the icon there I guess that's really small but it's it's called it's what is it V Y SOR visor let's see let me see the time oh man I got a rep let me go really quickly through the rest of the live chat and then I got a go to my meeting I can't be late to this meeting the head of my department is going to be in this one and my boss will be in it so definitely got to finish up quickly here so I'm gonna skip the comments so sorry I won't be able to read all the comments but I do want to get to the questions Schlow bird says how do I get an overview of all the JavaScript frameworks I just use basic js4 now and I don't know which with with which frameworks I should start I don't program for a living I don't know that there's a resource off the top of my head I don't know a resource that good there's an overview I imagine it probably exists somewhere so I'll tell you what send me a message on Twitter or something and then I'll send if I can find something I'll send it to you if I had more time in the stream I try to look something up right now so sorry about that but coming back for another stream or send me a message or something on Twitter and I'll try to help you out as best I can oh cool harsh it says there's a material design framework for react native so it's react native material design github I Oh awesome that sounds really cool like I said I'm not gonna do it now because I need to turn this in the deadlines almost here but after I turn it in if I do some extra work I I may end up using that okay all right hard should I see what you're saying about the SendGrid keys I'll test that out later on maybe after my meeting okay harsh it's asking about how to find freelance work yeah so like I don't have time to answer right now cuz I gotta go to my meeting but hard [ __ ] ask me that send me a message on Twitter or ask me in tomorrow stream and we can go over that in more depth I do have some advice I used to freelance for a few for like three years so I definitely have some advice on that so I'm happy to help you out with that world's s what's the disadvantage of PHP I don't work that much with PHP but one thing that I've noticed with PHP that I don't really like and I don't I haven't that looked at a lot but I have a coworker that's dealt with it a lot and it's been a problem is the different versions of PHP don't always work well together so he's worked on some legacy projects where he can't upgrade to newer versions of things because of issues with different PHP versions supporting different things so it's kind of he's kind of stuck and I'm afraid at times it can be a security issue because he has to run things in different versions of PHP we've inherited this you know this old code and so we have to keep different versions running and try to keep track of what will work on these different versions I don't really like that it seems like with JavaScript there's not that much of an issue like everything's always backwards compatible at least I haven't really run into anything like that so that's the at least for me the only did like bad thing I've run into with PHP and maybe there's a way around that and I just don't know it because I'm not I don't use PHP that much but otherwise you know and I know people that they make good money you know doing things with PHP and they do really cool stuff with it so so I don't think there's a problem using it Harshit says we you stream react native tomorrow maybe it depends on how much I get done on this project today I'm gonna work on it later on today so we'll see if I get it finished and I turn it in I may not stream about it if I if I don't then I probably will stream so maybe the answers may be all right so I got through everything sorry I had to skip over a lot of the comments and I couldn't give as good of answers as I normally do I guess that I'm just running out of time so I will be back tomorrow most likely in case I'm crazy unless something crazy happens I'll be around the same time around 2 p.m. Eastern time tomorrow and thank you so much for all your your help during this and a lot of great discussion in a live chat I love when that happens you're helping each other out and helping me out so it's just awesome but anyway I have to go and go to a meeting now so I'll be back tomorrow and until then have a great day
