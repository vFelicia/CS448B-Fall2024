00:00 - now let's build a pinterest clone
00:03 - first let's take a look at a cool
00:05 - pinterest clone that ashley built
00:10 - so the theme of her pinterest was
00:13 - winterist
00:15 - the notion of awesome victories
00:19 - and you can even watch this video
00:20 - that'll explain kind of how she came up
00:22 - with the idea
00:25 - so let's go ahead and log in
00:29 - we can connect with twitter
00:40 - and now it's redirecting me back
00:43 - here we go we see some winds that are
00:45 - popping up here
00:47 - um so let's go ahead and see if we can
00:50 - create one of our own so if we go to our
00:52 - wind board
00:53 - we see that i've already created two of
00:54 - these
00:56 - and i'm going to add a win
00:58 - so
01:00 - what that means is i'm going to need a
01:02 - url
01:03 - so let's think of something that's
01:05 - really cool
01:06 - um
01:10 - a winner is you this is a cool meme from
01:13 - some old video game
01:15 - it's just like really bad grammar
01:20 - so we'll just copy the image url
01:28 - and
01:29 - a winner is you
01:32 - we'll paste the link here
01:34 - and you can see how quickly a fetch that
01:35 - is great
01:36 - then we choose image
01:38 - video is eventually going to be
01:40 - supported
01:42 - you can see it shows up right there in
01:44 - my pin board
01:46 - and it even swapped the position of
01:47 - these two which is pretty cool
01:50 - now
01:51 - we can go ahead and look at all the
01:52 - recent wins
01:54 - and we can see
01:55 - that my new win
01:57 - is right here pretty cool huh
01:59 - so i can go and i can like other
02:02 - people's wins
02:05 - so i can like this u.s world cup team
02:07 - the women's world cup team that just won
02:11 - we can like and unlike other things too
02:14 - so
02:15 - it's pretty cool
02:17 - and
02:19 - let's take a look at the user stories
02:24 - first as an unauthenticated user i can
02:26 - log in with twitter
02:28 - as an authenticated user i can link to
02:30 - images which we did
02:32 - as an authenticated user i can delete
02:34 - images that i've linked to
02:38 - and as an authenticated user i can see a
02:40 - pinterest style wall of all the images
02:42 - i've linked to
02:44 - and as an authenticated user i can
02:46 - browse other users walls of images i
02:49 - don't need to be authenticated for that
02:51 - so basically it's kind of like a public
02:53 - pinterest file very similar to pinterest
02:56 - much of the same functionality
02:58 - and as a bonus user story
03:00 - as an authenticated user if i upload an
03:03 - image that is broken
03:05 - it will be replaced by a placeholder
03:08 - image and you can do this with jquery
03:10 - broken image detection
03:12 - a quick hint
03:14 - mason masonry jas is an excellent
03:17 - library that will allow for you to have
03:20 - the pinterest style grids where
03:22 - different objects of different heights
03:24 - fit
03:25 - in it's kind of like breaking
03:27 - it it's a sequence of bricks like you
03:30 - see on pinterest or like you saw here on
03:31 - winters
03:33 - just to make sure that um
03:36 - you see that see how these are different
03:38 - height and it kind of figures out
03:41 - what to put where and make it look
03:42 - reasonably good that is masonry js
03:46 - so um i think you can have a lot of fun
03:49 - with this choose a cool theme
03:51 - make it fun
03:52 - and we're looking forward to seeing it
03:55 - enjoy
