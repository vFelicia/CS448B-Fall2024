00:00 - in this video i'll be introducing the
00:01 - rational numbers and set builder
00:03 - notation
00:04 - the rational numbers are defined as
00:07 - a ratio of two integers
00:09 - and examples include the integers
00:11 - themselves
00:13 - terminating decimals and repeating
00:14 - decimals so let's start with repeating
00:17 - decimals if we let 10x
00:19 - equal 9.999 repeating then if we divide
00:22 - by both sides by 10 then x equals 0.999
00:26 - repeating and if we subtract x from 10x
00:28 - we have nine x equals nine
00:31 - and then divide both sides by nine we
00:32 - have x equals one
00:34 - and then
00:35 - if we multiply by ten both sides by ten
00:37 - we have ten x equals ten so now we have
00:40 - ten x
00:41 - equals ten but ten x also equals 9.99
00:43 - and repeating so we have now and these
00:46 - are in fact true 9.99 repeating equals
00:48 - 10. so we've we can now express 10x as
00:52 - an integer which is a
00:54 - a
00:55 - rational number we can put 10 divided by
00:58 - 1 which is a ratio
01:01 - so
01:02 - another problem we have is terminating
01:04 - decimals if we have 2.78 equal to y then
01:08 - we can just
01:09 - easily say 278 divided by 100 equals y
01:12 - as well
01:13 - these are two integers and
01:16 - it's a it's another rational number so
01:19 - a convenient way to define these
01:22 - or is denoted with a q
01:25 - and this is called set builder notation
01:26 - we have the q equals the set containing
01:29 - elements
01:31 - a divided by b such that a
01:33 - and b are elements of the integers
01:36 - with the only condition that b
01:37 - cannot equal zero if you divide
01:40 - by zero uh it's it's undefined it
01:43 - doesn't mean anything so
01:45 - if you're interested in that i recommend
01:46 - googling it i think it's interesting

in this video i'll be introducing the rational numbers and set builder notation the rational numbers are defined as a ratio of two integers and examples include the integers themselves terminating decimals and repeating decimals so let's start with repeating decimals if we let 10x equal 9.999 repeating then if we divide by both sides by 10 then x equals 0.999 repeating and if we subtract x from 10x we have nine x equals nine and then divide both sides by nine we have x equals one and then if we multiply by ten both sides by ten we have ten x equals ten so now we have ten x equals ten but ten x also equals 9.99 and repeating so we have now and these are in fact true 9.99 repeating equals 10. so we've we can now express 10x as an integer which is a a rational number we can put 10 divided by 1 which is a ratio so another problem we have is terminating decimals if we have 2.78 equal to y then we can just easily say 278 divided by 100 equals y as well these are two integers and it's a it's another rational number so a convenient way to define these or is denoted with a q and this is called set builder notation we have the q equals the set containing elements a divided by b such that a and b are elements of the integers with the only condition that b cannot equal zero if you divide by zero uh it's it's undefined it doesn't mean anything so if you're interested in that i recommend googling it i think it's interesting
