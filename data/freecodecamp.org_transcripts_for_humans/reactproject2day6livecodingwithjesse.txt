00:08 - hey everybody its Jesse and it's we're
00:14 - going to start out today doing a going
00:16 - over a pool request and I was just
00:18 - testing it out so I've gotten pretty
00:22 - much nothing done since yesterday so
00:24 - we're gonna start right where we left
00:26 - off that so yesterday after I ended I
00:30 - just answer some emails talk to my boss
00:33 - a little bit and then left this morning
00:35 - I bet I've been in meetings all day so
00:39 - there actually have been interviewing
00:42 - someone for web developer position so we
00:44 - did an interview like a panel interview
00:47 - and then I just got back from doing a
00:49 - technical interview it was kind of cool
00:51 - because we actually used some free code
00:54 - camp challenges for the technical
00:56 - interview so I thought that was kind of
00:58 - fun and I've heard that other people do
01:02 - that as well so I don't know if it's a
01:04 - widespread thing but hey you know if you
01:06 - go through the free code camp challenges
01:08 - then you got a shot at maybe seeing it
01:10 - in an interview so might help you out
01:17 - also I got a comment on one of my videos
01:20 - saying that I should talk less and code
01:24 - more and I was actually thinking the
01:27 - same thing yesterday afternoon so I'm
01:30 - gonna try to do that I can't guarantee
01:32 - anything because as as you all know from
01:36 - watching a I do tend to talk so I'm
01:40 - gonna try to talk when I need to to
01:42 - explain what's going on in the code and
01:44 - then of course to answer questions but
01:47 - other than that I am going to try to do
01:49 - more code I
01:58 - let's see was I gonna say oh okay I do
02:02 - some silent streams on my own channel
02:05 - occasionally so if you really would
02:07 - rather just see the code and not worry
02:09 - about my commentary on the code check
02:11 - out those streams
02:13 - I don't really schedule them too far in
02:16 - advance I just kind of do it whenever I
02:18 - have some time here and there throughout
02:20 - the day so the best way to hear about
02:22 - them
02:22 - I usually tweet about them so if you
02:25 - follow me on Twitter you'll probably see
02:26 - the tweet or if you subscribe to my
02:28 - channel you'll get an alert but those
02:32 - are just like I said I don't schedule
02:33 - them it'll just happen and I'll do it
02:35 - until usually for like an hour or so
02:39 - until something comes up at work and I
02:40 - can't do it anymore alright so I'm gonna
02:46 - say hi to everyone in the live chat and
02:48 - I have some have some questions already
02:56 - a question have you ever had a female
03:00 - boss yeah I have so my my immediate
03:04 - supervisor is a male and then the
03:08 - director of my department and the
03:11 - executive director of my department are
03:13 - both women and I've worked for four
03:17 - women before so not not really a big
03:24 - deal to me okay also this video is going
03:33 - to be shorter than normal so I told you
03:36 - yesterday that I kept trying to go see
03:39 - this guy's computer and about an issue
03:42 - he's having with a website I made and
03:46 - it's it's on campus here and I I haven't
03:50 - been able to get a time it's the one
03:52 - that I thought possibly might be using
03:54 - Internet Explorer 9 so I got an email
03:57 - back from him saying that he'll be there
03:59 - around 4 p.m. so I'm not missing this
04:02 - opportunity I have to know what is
04:04 - really going on with this website he's
04:07 - saying he gets a blank screen and
04:08 - nothing
04:09 - happens at all which is crazy so I want
04:11 - to know so I definitely am gonna shoot
04:15 - for like being over around like 3:30
04:20 - Eastern Time
04:21 - so maybe about an hour long stream I
04:23 - could probably go a little bit longer
04:25 - than that and still make it there but I
04:27 - don't want to take any chances alright
04:32 - so let me show you what's what's going
04:34 - on here I'm working on this error
04:36 - message right now so I have let's see
04:43 - this sidebar item J s is giving me an
04:46 - error no duplicate props allowed and I
04:52 - got this because if you notice these are
04:56 - now the same color which is awesome so
05:00 - that was a a pool request that I got
05:02 - from let me show you the pool request
05:08 - where do I have it
05:17 - okay so here's the pool request and
05:24 - alright so there's a one in the name so
05:28 - let me I think I I have a message on
05:34 - Twitter from this person as well so okay
05:37 - soul a late want I'm not I'm not really
05:39 - sure I pronounce it but sent this pool
05:42 - request
05:43 - so if you're watching let me know how to
05:44 - pronounce your name cuz I don't wanna
05:45 - get it wrong so basically as it says it
05:49 - customized the hover event okay so it
05:53 - just ended up using if you remember
05:55 - yesterday we were Sebastian was saying
05:58 - it's the the list item that needs to get
06:02 - the the hover but the list item was
06:05 - being created by the I think it was the
06:08 - menu item component yeah the menu item
06:12 - component so we couldn't access it
06:14 - directly so now let's just switch to
06:16 - using the menu item directly and it
06:18 - seems like everything works the same as
06:21 - it did before so that's not exactly how
06:26 - its said to do this side drawer and the
06:29 - documentation but it works so I think
06:33 - I'm gonna pull it in but before I pull
06:35 - it in I tested it and I got that error
06:39 - so I just want to work on that error
06:41 - first and then pull this in to the
06:46 - master branch and then we can continue
06:49 - on with our layout for everybody that's
06:52 - new joining I want to explain so if
06:56 - you're joining from Twitter I had said
07:00 - I'm using material UI and materialized
07:02 - CSS which may be a little bit confusing
07:05 - so we're using material UI and all the
07:08 - nice react components that it has but
07:10 - when there's a feature that it doesn't
07:12 - have that I like from materialized then
07:18 - I'm gonna pull that in so we've pulled
07:20 - in the column classes already and we're
07:24 - probably gonna pull in some other things
07:25 - like I like how they they do they're
07:27 - responsive font so we'll probably pull
07:29 - that in and we'll
07:30 - as we go along so we're gonna use a
07:31 - blend of the two and I have started the
07:37 - and rock server so let me I'm gonna
07:40 - paste that link in for you all so you
07:42 - can follow along and in case you can't
07:49 - see the live chat right now for some
07:52 - reason here is the link this one here I
07:58 - mean this one would work too I guess but
08:00 - this one's HTTPS which is better so I
08:02 - guess so why not
08:09 - alright so the links in the chat now so
08:13 - here we go you can see getting some
08:16 - activity there so let me know if
08:19 - anything goes wrong with that I won't be
08:21 - watching this as I code so if if it
08:23 - quits working please let me know and
08:31 - let's check out that error so it did say
08:35 - it was on line line 24 of the sidebar
08:43 - item which is right here so that's not
08:46 - actually before I let me open this back
08:53 - up if you remember I think yesterday we
08:55 - were having the problem where when I
08:57 - switch branches the code wasn't
08:59 - automatically changing which I'm almost
09:02 - positive that it did automatically
09:03 - change before but for some reason it's
09:09 - not so I'm gonna open that back up again
09:11 - just to see there we go
09:13 - now this makes a lot more sense okay so
09:18 - on line 24 we have this hover color okay
09:22 - so we see the hover colors here is red
09:24 - and the hover color down here is a
09:25 - different color so let's take out this
09:27 - hover color and that should fix the air
09:30 - because you know that that makes sense
09:33 - you shouldn't have to props that have
09:36 - the same name because that's confusing
09:40 - all right cool air is fixed there we go
09:47 - we still have these hairs which I don't
09:49 - wear these air is coming from it's where
09:54 - I get these errors all the time in
09:56 - production or in development but not in
10:00 - production so not worried about them
10:04 - right now so now that that works let's
10:12 - commit that and then merge this branch
10:14 - into the master branch so I am going to
10:19 - explain every time I do something on get
10:22 - our in the command line I'm gonna
10:23 - explain that for everyone who's not
10:26 - familiar with it so for those of you who
10:28 - are familiar with it if it's kind of
10:31 - annoying that I keep explaining this and
10:33 - you all know that I'm sorry but I'm
10:36 - gonna gonna keep doing it because I
10:38 - think it's better to explain it for the
10:40 - people that don't know it then than to
10:42 - not because otherwise they'll be really
10:44 - lost so we're gonna do git status just
10:48 - to double-check that we've only changed
10:50 - the component that we meant to change
10:52 - and we have in fact only changed that
10:56 - component and then we're gonna get
10:57 - commit a.m. and that the a means we're
11:03 - gonna add everything and we're going to
11:05 - include the message right in our command
11:08 - so it'll say remove remove duplicate
11:15 - props
11:19 - all right awesome and I'm going to merge
11:26 - this now
11:32 - so I've already merged master into that
11:36 - the other branch and I did the test
11:38 - there so maybe there's a better way to
11:42 - do it but I like to do it like that
11:44 - because that way if if something there's
11:48 - some weird errors and it breaks a lot of
11:50 - stuff when I merge it it's only broken
11:53 - that one branch and I haven't messed up
11:55 - master so then it's just easier to
11:58 - switch right back to master instead of
12:01 - having to worry about trying to roll
12:03 - back you know to a different version of
12:05 - it and then it's great because once you
12:08 - have it right and it's everything's
12:10 - fixed then you just switch over to
12:12 - master emerge and everything works so
12:14 - let's do that so we're gonna go get
12:16 - merge so when you merge you go to the
12:22 - branch that you want to merge the other
12:23 - branch into so I'm in master because I
12:26 - want to merge something into master I'm
12:29 - sure there's other ways to do it as well
12:30 - but this is the way I always do it and
12:32 - I'm gonna say what branch I want to
12:35 - merge into my current branch and in this
12:37 - case I want to merge what did I call
12:39 - that thinks the only Oberon all right
12:42 - awesome so you could see we had
12:46 - obviously no conflicts because that
12:50 - branch had already merged with master
12:53 - before or had master merge into it
12:56 - before so now we'll have double check
13:03 - make sure everything's working yes it is
13:06 - working
13:07 - and
13:10 - I'm gonna push this so we'll see if
13:17 - you've never seen how for requests works
13:20 - basically you you can see the merge
13:23 - completed right there pretty much
13:26 - real-time if I go get push origin master
13:31 - to push it out to get up now it's pushed
13:35 - there and I can't remember if it
13:38 - refreshes automatically or if I have to
13:43 - refresh the page I can't remember let me
13:46 - try a page refresh basically what should
13:48 - happen is it should say merged yep there
13:55 - we go it says merge so I guess you have
14:00 - not sure if you have to wait for the
14:02 - Refresh for some reason I thought I'd
14:04 - seen it just happen automatically before
14:06 - but maybe I didn't see that maybe I
14:09 - don't know what I'm talking about
14:10 - alright so that's another pull request
14:13 - so thank you for got a lot of pull
14:16 - requests for this project so far a lot
14:19 - of really good ones so I really
14:22 - appreciate that and let me show let me
14:28 - just throw up on the screen really quick
14:30 - the contributors so far so here we go
14:36 - here's our contributors so thank you to
14:38 - everyone who has contributed and
14:43 - actually yeah yeah that's everybody ok
14:56 - okay so let's continue on with our
15:00 - layout so I think I've decided the way I
15:06 - want to do this is just run through and
15:08 - get the base layout for every page and
15:09 - then I'll go in and work on just the
15:13 - details yeah I think it would be easier
15:18 - that way I'll get an idea for when we
15:21 - reuse things so when I go to handle
15:23 - changing the styles to make it work I'll
15:26 - have a better idea of you know if I
15:28 - change the style globally how it will
15:30 - affect another page and then otherwise
15:34 - if I go page by page I might decide to
15:36 - change so globally and then later on
15:38 - have to you know edit it and so it could
15:43 - end up being a bit more messy than it
15:46 - needs to be in the in the CSS so let's
15:50 - move on so this page is basically how we
15:53 - want it with the exception of I mean
15:56 - obviously this is still lorem ipsum text
15:58 - and everything but we'll fill that in
16:03 - logos I'm gonna skip logos for now
16:09 - because that's gonna be difficult I
16:13 - don't know it won't be that difficult
16:15 - it's not like we've never done anything
16:17 - like that before in react because we
16:20 - have but it's just gonna be a lot and
16:23 - since I want to keep it short today I'm
16:25 - not gonna get into that so the posters
16:28 - view we got to bring up our the project
16:33 - as it currently stands the current live
16:37 - version so we can see what we're but we
16:39 - need to to build out
16:44 - all right on my other screen I'm
16:46 - bringing it up and I'll just pull it
16:47 - over when it's ready also I am
16:55 - broadcasting on Instagram so it looks
17:00 - like that some people watching including
17:02 - my wife so hey thanks for watching
17:07 - actually I should I showed my kids one
17:11 - of the Instagram videos of me doing this
17:13 - and they were like the baby was just
17:15 - staring and smiling she was like a mace
17:17 - that I was in the phone and also sitting
17:21 - right there that was pretty fun alright
17:25 - so here's what we have currently live
17:29 - and this is behind a like a password
17:34 - [Music]
17:35 - password protected site so sorry you
17:39 - can't check this out right now it's not
17:42 - there's not really anything private in
17:44 - here that would require having a
17:46 - password but we just that's how it was
17:49 - set up so the new one won't require a
17:53 - password and we're looking at posters
17:57 - okay so we're just gonna need while this
18:03 - would be easy so basically the same
18:05 - thing that we did on the home page
18:07 - except a different little bit different
18:10 - organization of the cards so ready go to
18:16 - 2 columns and 3 rows so that's gonna be
18:24 - super easy we can copy and paste a lot
18:26 - of what we did for home so I'm gonna
18:29 - throw foam actually I already have it
18:31 - over there cool
18:32 - so we have home on this side so we can
18:35 - easily copy it and posters there we go
18:40 - let's bring up posters
18:44 - so I'm gonna copy all of this
19:00 - I'm just double-checking okay
19:07 - all right I'm gonna copy that and we're
19:10 - just gonna have to change around the
19:13 - columns a little bit so right now we
19:19 - need to change all these m fours - we
19:26 - need them to be M twos and I do want to
19:30 - change up these rows so we only had two
19:33 - rows before and now I want three rows so
19:38 - I'm gonna copy this and we need one two
19:43 - and then after this second column we're
19:48 - gonna put in this row we also need to
19:53 - close out the first row so we're gonna
19:55 - put a closing div tag all right so now
19:59 - we've started our row we don't have to
20:01 - close that because we'll just we're
20:02 - using the closing div that was in the
20:04 - other one so we can just delete this row
20:09 - right one two actually might have to add
20:12 - another one we can't keep it straight in
20:14 - my head so we have 1 2 in the first row
20:17 - and that is properly closed good Row two
20:20 - one
20:25 - let's get rid of that yeah okay row two
20:28 - one two and close it out and then
20:36 - finally one more one more row and that
20:41 - is oh that one is already closed out so
20:44 - this should work but save it and no
20:49 - error syntax error okay what do we do
20:57 - okay I probably just forgot to yeah I
21:01 - didn't copy this stuff at the bottom so
21:05 - we just need to close that return and
21:09 - our render now it should work no oh we
21:19 - didn't I didn't copy that either so we
21:24 - need to import our components that we're
21:27 - using so we need to import that from
21:31 - material UI but save it now now will it
21:35 - work yeah okay so it works it doesn't
21:38 - look exactly the one or two but we have
21:40 - the number of cards that we want so let
21:43 - me eat you see what's going on here so
21:50 - I'm even bring over a dev tools so you
21:55 - can all see what's going on and if
21:57 - you're checking out the site using the
22:01 - link that I shared to Endre you could
22:04 - inspect this as well if you want to all
22:07 - right so let's see we have a container
22:08 - the row the columns oh I I know what cuz
22:13 - I said M - all right I'm sure you all
22:17 - caught that mistake and I just haven't
22:18 - looked at the live chat for a while but
22:22 - my mistake was I put M - in my mind I
22:25 - was thinking like I wanted it to be half
22:28 - of the page and so for some reason it
22:30 - made sense to me that - was somehow half
22:34 - but really the way it works is that you
22:37 - need to specify the number of call
22:38 - you wanted to take up out of 12 columns
22:41 - so 12 would be full width so I need to
22:43 - do 6 these are the materialized column
22:46 - classes so that should work now there we
22:52 - go now we have what we wanted and all
22:57 - right so that's it so we're good this
22:58 - page layout is fine like I said I'm I'm
23:01 - not gonna worry about this you we can
23:02 - already see having some sort of you know
23:06 - padding up here is gonna be necessary
23:09 - probably for every page so that's why I
23:12 - wasn't really worried about doing it at
23:13 - first until we get everything laid out
23:16 - and then I could see like okay well what
23:19 - element is gonna be the best to put that
23:20 - padding on that'll apply everywhere we
23:23 - need it and if there's somewhere where
23:25 - we don't need it then we want to make
23:28 - sure it won't apply there so let's move
23:31 - on posters letterhead see actually I
23:38 - just remembered I have my poem adora
23:42 - timer and I keep forgetting to use it so
23:45 - put that on there I don't think I
23:48 - mentioned this yesterday a day before
23:50 - but somebody made a Pomodoro timer in
23:53 - Java like a desktop Pomodoro timer and
23:56 - sent it to me to try out so I haven't
23:58 - gotten a chance to try it out yet but
24:00 - maybe I'll try it out and I think I want
24:04 - to try it out on my laptop and not on my
24:06 - work computer because well like the IT
24:08 - department gets a little bit upset about
24:11 - downloading things so not that I suspect
24:14 - anything from this app or the guy that
24:16 - sent me the app but just so that I don't
24:19 - possibly get in trouble I'm gonna try it
24:21 - out on my laptop see how it is and maybe
24:25 - maybe then install it here and show you
24:27 - all but let's check out what the
24:30 - letterhead view is supposed to look like
24:32 - and go back
24:38 - thank the letterhead oh okay
24:44 - so it seems like all right not too bad I
24:47 - have letterhead view is just some text
24:51 - and then each one of these is a card and
24:56 - so this is just an image alright so
25:03 - we'll just import the the cards will
25:05 - leave the media section of the card we
25:07 - need the title section and then we need
25:09 - the the action bar section of the card
25:14 - so there'll be a little bit different
25:16 - than the cards that we just used on the
25:18 - last page but the good news is I mean
25:22 - none of these are components that are
25:24 - foreign to material designs so they're
25:26 - all there they are all available for us
25:29 - to use so we would probably won't need
25:32 - to customize too much cool move that to
25:40 - the side and let's check out this
25:48 - leatherhead okay
25:53 - so within letterhead let's create
26:02 - actually let me bring in let me bring in
26:06 - what we just did for the posters because
26:12 - we're gonna we're gonna want rows of two
26:15 - and since we already have some rows of
26:18 - two then why not use them so we are
26:25 - gonna have to change the card
26:26 - significantly but at least we can keep
26:28 - all of the the column classes pretty
26:32 - much as is we'll just delete that last
26:33 - row so we'll take this row and get rid
26:37 - of it great and then let's import not
26:47 - only this will import that we will no
26:51 - longer need the card text so we'll get
26:53 - rid of that and then we'll check out the
26:57 - documentation for material UI and the
27:01 - cards and we need to add in card actions
27:07 - and card media
27:19 - Media and then we're gonna take out card
27:25 - text we don't need that or actually
27:30 - let's just do this
27:39 - put that we'll make that card actions
27:43 - get rid of all this lorem ipsum there we
27:48 - go and then let's check out the docs to
27:52 - see how we need to do this
27:55 - so within card actions we need to flat
27:58 - button so let's bring in that flat
28:00 - button let's see how that looks
28:03 - yeah that's that's pretty much what we
28:06 - want so let's bring in the flat button
28:11 - and then we'll also bring in this action
28:17 - and we only need one action some only
28:21 - gonna bring in one of these components
28:24 - there we go so we have our button the
28:26 - last thing we need to bring in is this
28:28 - card media so let's check out how it's
28:30 - done here so card media let's pull this
28:40 - and I don't really want the overlay
28:43 - though how do they do that
28:50 - not we're not gonna use the overlay but
28:54 - we are obviously going to have an image
28:57 - and this image is not gonna work all you
29:00 - know it's so we don't even have an
29:02 - images folder so we'll pull in we're
29:05 - pulling a photo from somewhere else but
29:10 - we want to place that above the title
29:13 - oops
29:17 - and
29:25 - I should have been doing this all along
29:33 - there we go
29:34 - paste that in and I'll copy this as soon
29:39 - as I remove this stuff so I don't want
29:42 - oh that's interesting I just want to
29:47 - want to show you all this because it's
29:49 - interesting
29:49 - so the props the overlay prop
29:53 - we're actually passing in a reactive
29:56 - component which is cool I don't think
29:58 - I've ever done that before
29:59 - so actually passing in another component
30:02 - with its own props as the props for the
30:07 - card media I don't know
30:11 - didn't know you could do that that's
30:12 - really cool okay so and our image all
30:22 - right let's see what did we try to use
30:24 - before that didn't work was it it was
30:28 - the Bill Murray stock photos didn't work
30:30 - right I think it was a course issue so
30:33 - we're not gonna be able to do that
30:34 - unfortunately I'd love to be able to use
30:37 - Bill Murray so I think I'm just gonna
30:38 - use unsplash so we can go to unsplash
30:47 - and I'm gonna check the proper
30:50 - dimensions here for that image so what
30:54 - dimensions are we using 509 by 659 is
30:59 - that really what dimensions I used 509 I
31:05 - mean I'm sure it's it's obviously
31:07 - responsive so it's gonna get bigger or
31:09 - smaller bucks 600 by 766 was the
31:13 - original like how do it I had to have
31:18 - gotten an image like pre-made like that
31:20 - cuz I can't I don't see how I would have
31:23 - made an image like that 600 by 776 okay
31:31 - yeah so let's get an image that's 600 by
31:36 - 776
31:38 - so I want to get a random image because
31:43 - that's fun and then you don't get as
31:45 - bored looking at it and let's pop that
31:48 - in here and I can't ever remember which
31:53 - ones with and which ones height for this
31:57 - alright so this is a two by three so
32:00 - that must mean two is the height and
32:03 - three others with all right so the
32:07 - height was now I can't remember 600 by
32:12 - 770 okay so let's do alright let's let's
32:26 - try that let's see how this works
32:29 - oops we're yet
32:35 - no no it looks like I did some bad copy
32:39 - and pasting that let's check out what
32:41 - the problem is
32:53 - all right that should fix it I should be
32:55 - good I want to check to make sure our
32:59 - URL works before I copy it hmm looks
33:04 - like it didn't that's the problem
33:19 - that's odd I'm not even there we go
33:23 - cool you just took a little louder to
33:26 - come in alright so now that we know that
33:28 - works we're going to copy this as well
33:41 - and let's see I don't know it broke
33:45 - I didn't work last time and break this
33:48 - you know what I probably yeah I click
33:53 - the the button to add another one I
33:59 - still don't know why that would cause it
34:00 - to be broken but I did add another image
34:05 - when I need to
34:13 - ah now I'm getting a Corsair that's
34:23 - weird that I didn't get one before and
34:25 - now I'm getting one
34:26 - let me try let's see can you all see the
34:36 - images over n drop okay all right cool
34:44 - I'm saying it now no I don't like how
34:48 - the random image gives you the same
34:50 - random image since you're you know
34:52 - making a call for all of it if you have
34:54 - it I think if you have the components
34:59 - like loading in it at different times
35:01 - you can get them to have different
35:03 - images I've actually I've done it before
35:07 - where I'd have it pick a random number
35:11 - and then use that to grab an image so I
35:14 - just so that I could get random images
35:16 - all in the same load but in any case it
35:20 - doesn't really matter this is only what
35:22 - we needed to see was just to get the
35:24 - dimensions
35:25 - let's move it around just a bit cool all
35:32 - right
35:32 - it looks like
35:38 - yeah we definitely I'm just checking it
35:42 - again so we definitely have to do
35:44 - something about the padding in here but
35:46 - it'll be a little tricky because so we
35:48 - have proper padding between rows this is
35:51 - our row break so I'd like to have
35:55 - consistent padding so it may have to
35:58 - have some media queries there to make
36:01 - sure that you know if we're gonna add
36:03 - padding let's say to each column we want
36:06 - to make sure we take it away from the
36:08 - row right now I'm not worried about
36:11 - adjusting anything the last thing we
36:13 - need to do is add some text at the top
36:15 - so it looked like it looked here like we
36:21 - just had two paragraphs of text so let's
36:24 - just throw in two paragraphs inside
36:26 - we're gonna put it inside another row
36:28 - and then we're gonna have a column a
36:31 - full width column and then we'll put two
36:35 - paragraphs into that column and I'm
36:40 - gonna use I think it was Sarah that
36:44 - recommended the Bible if some site to
36:49 - use for lorem ipsum so I think we'd use
36:52 - Samuel Jackson if some I've used bacon
36:55 - ipsum before but since this is a
36:58 - Catholic University I think it would be
37:01 - better if I use Bible ipsum and I think
37:03 - the people that I work for would like it
37:05 - better if I use Bible ipsum as opposed
37:07 - to Samuel Jackson quotes so hi I just
37:15 - saw the the first quote that I saw in
37:19 - Bible if some of my other screen
37:20 - actually like spells out the one of the
37:25 - words for God that is to some groups of
37:29 - Jewish people as actually you're not
37:31 - really supposed to spell that out or say
37:32 - it so I'm gonna use a different verse
37:34 - out of respect for that and not not use
37:39 - that
37:43 - oh man I'm seeing it in so many places
38:07 - why is it giving me this is actually
38:09 - really weird the the Bible if some
38:12 - generator is giving me the the same so I
38:18 - would assume it would give me like
38:19 - random stuff but it's giving me the same
38:21 - stuff let's see if I put in two if it'll
38:24 - be different no it's the same thing
38:27 - fresh now I want a different quote
38:41 - am I missing something all right all
38:45 - right I'll try I will live some a
38:46 - different day because I don't want to
38:48 - spend a lot of time on that I mean you
38:50 - would you would assume that you would
38:53 - get different Bible clothes right I
38:56 - might I might have to make my own that
39:00 - sounds like a good side project oh I'll
39:05 - make my own because your says what is it
39:07 - freak out camp has the random quote
39:08 - generator project so I'm sure there's
39:10 - some API out there and that you can get
39:12 - bible quotes from or like scrape the
39:15 - site or something so let's add in let's
39:21 - just add in what we know we need and
39:23 - just generate some lorem ipsum oops
39:27 - we're gonna do a div with a class name
39:33 - I'm gonna see cool with the class name
39:37 - of oops Roe and we also want a div with
39:46 - the class name of column and then you
39:52 - wanna make that in s 12 and that means
39:55 - if you're using materialized
39:57 - that means on small screens is gonna
39:59 - take up 12 columns and I wanted always
40:03 - to take up 12 columns so I'm not gonna
40:04 - add anything else otherwise you would
40:06 - add like in this case we added on medium
40:09 - screens the N we want to only take up 6
40:11 - out of the 12 columns so be 50% with now
40:16 - we're gonna add our P tag and eventually
40:20 - I guess said before I'll probably put in
40:22 - the float X class but I need to bring
40:24 - that in for materialized so I'm not
40:26 - gonna look for it right now but I like
40:29 - the flow text since I did this site
40:31 - originally I've read some articles on
40:33 - proper font size and I'm convinced now
40:37 - they larger font size is almost always
40:40 - better for readability so I currently on
40:46 - newer sites that I'm making I use a much
40:49 - larger font size than I had previously
40:51 - and the flow text is a nice response
40:54 - of font size and make sure that it's a
40:57 - decent size
40:58 - all right so I can generate lorem ipsum
41:03 - whoa that's long string let me
41:16 - I was hoping there'd be some setting
41:18 - that I could get to really easily to
41:21 - wrap that I might have to actually go
41:23 - into preferences
41:36 - hmm I thought there was a wrap setting
41:41 - I'm missing it
41:56 - why are you editor settings
42:06 - area
42:12 - all right so soft rap somebody had
42:15 - mentioned soft rap in a comment or
42:18 - something and I think it was I think it
42:24 - was Nathaniel so anyway yeah see how
42:28 - much nicer that is thanks to Daniel for
42:30 - bringing that up maybe I have it maybe
42:33 - it's on my laptop
42:34 - but I thought I had that enabled
42:36 - somewhere but I guess not so just we're
42:42 - gonna throw in the two paragraphs and
42:46 - all right cool so that looks looks like
42:54 - we have the layout that we want yep
43:02 - obviously we're gonna change change a
43:06 - little bit we don't need this card
43:07 - subtitle actually yeah let's take that
43:09 - out I didn't realize I have the card
43:11 - subtitle in there oh yeah actually the
43:17 - more I look at these components from
43:19 - material UI the more I like them a lot
43:21 - of these like options are really nice
43:24 - like things that I would build myself
43:26 - pretty much every time like adding a
43:29 - subtitle you know would just add a span
43:32 - and you know have to set all the
43:35 - properties to make it look like that
43:36 - it's really cool that that's built in
43:41 - but you don't want to subtitle right now
43:44 - so we're gonna take it out so I'm
43:47 - thinking that once I once I get the hang
43:50 - of material UI and really start to learn
43:53 - how it works I think I will like it all
43:57 - right cool
43:58 - so that page is done let's see that was
44:04 - letter at a share story next is that
44:06 - next dress here share story
44:09 - okay so currently for share story what
44:12 - we have is we actually have a card with
44:16 - a bunch of text and a four
44:25 - hmm I'm not exactly sure that I want to
44:29 - keep this in a card so I'm gonna go I
44:32 - haven't checked the live chat in a while
44:35 - so I am gonna check back here but I'm
44:37 - gonna ask a question first and hopefully
44:39 - you all can help me when it comes to
44:42 - material design generally you you don't
44:48 - use cards in this way right you would if
44:51 - you have pieces of content you know that
44:55 - that are gonna be separate and like it's
44:58 - okay to put those in cars but usually
44:59 - like in this case I'm essentially using
45:02 - the card as a container for everything
45:04 - that's on this page with the exception
45:06 - of the header so I don't really think
45:09 - this is the proper way to use it I think
45:12 - it may be better in this case to simply
45:15 - put this right on the screen kind of the
45:21 - paper in the background so I don't know
45:26 - what do you all think we could try to
45:28 - put this on the screen over here and see
45:32 - how it looks
45:34 - we'll have to bring in we haven't you
45:36 - worked with any form components yet so
45:38 - we'll have to bring that in so I think I
45:40 - think it's worth a try but let me check
45:44 - the time yeah actually
45:48 - at this point I'm gonna stop and I'm
45:50 - gonna go over to the live chat and
45:52 - that'll probably be all we get in today
45:55 - so we've done a couple of use the layout
45:58 - for it the next thing we'll probably do
46:00 - is bring in some of these components for
46:03 - forms and I'm at least gonna try out
46:08 - leaving out the card for this just to
46:12 - kind of more properly stick to the
46:14 - material design spec it's when I did
46:18 - this site I was I was just starting out
46:20 - with learning material design so I kind
46:22 - of used cars for everything okay so now
46:27 - if you were just here for the code part
46:29 - of it thanks for watching I'm gonna do a
46:31 - Q&A session now before
46:32 - I finish up so if you're not interested
46:34 - in sticking around for the questions and
46:36 - answers I'll see I'll be back tomorrow
46:39 - morning with another live stream so if
46:43 - you can join me then otherwise if you
46:48 - have a question put it in the live chat
46:50 - or you can ask me on any social media
46:54 - thing a lot of people ask me things on
46:56 - Twitter or you can put it in a comment
47:00 - on the video so let me scroll up to the
47:04 - top and I'm just going to get it on
47:07 - through actually I'm gonna see I'm just
47:12 - go back down to the bottom just to see
47:13 - if you all answered my question alright
47:16 - Rohan says an edge-to-edge card
47:30 - okay all right John Hanson says I
47:36 - suggest a story card looks too much like
47:37 - a modal and so its function looks like a
47:40 - person would maybe want to dismiss it so
47:43 - yes resign okay cool I'd know I didn't
47:45 - think about that but now that you said
47:47 - it it does kind of look like it could be
47:49 - a modal cool okay Kevin says I think
47:55 - with a big enough font and responsive
47:57 - container it would look just fine on the
47:59 - paper on the back if you're not sure
48:01 - what we're talking about like when I say
48:02 - paper in material design language this
48:06 - background so behind the card is the
48:09 - paper right and certain things sit
48:11 - normally on the paper and this is what I
48:13 - didn't know when I made this site but
48:15 - like the print the copy the text here
48:18 - this font is considered ink okay so ink
48:21 - goes directly onto a paper it has no
48:24 - height to it right that's why we don't
48:25 - put box or we don't put shadows on on
48:30 - text in material design all right
48:33 - because it sits on the paper the same
48:35 - thing like with an image normally an
48:36 - image sits flat all right that's that's
48:38 - ink but then if certain things we can
48:41 - bring out all right look like a card but
48:44 - it would be better like we don't want to
48:47 - put everything on the card and it's
48:49 - weird so it makes it implies almost that
48:53 - we could move the card out or get rid of
48:55 - it or there's something behind it so
48:57 - anyway that I'm no expert on material
48:58 - design but at least that's my
49:00 - understanding so if you hear me say
49:02 - paper I basically just mean the
49:03 - background that you see I mean you can
49:08 - see the entire background here so this
49:09 - is we mean me the paper
49:15 - okay and Rohan says it feels like the
49:18 - description text is too large so are you
49:23 - talking about this text I'm not sure but
49:28 - anyway yeah this is this text that I
49:31 - have at the top of these pages might
49:32 - entirely go away it might end up uh I
49:36 - think I'd rather go with a really small
49:38 - header and then move these as to be like
49:41 - titles to each page so down here we'll
49:46 - see I'm I want to see how it looks kind
49:48 - of messed around with it okay so thanks
49:51 - for your your feedback those good
49:53 - feedback definitely agree with it so now
49:57 - I'm gonna go to the top and try to
49:58 - answer some questions and let's see also
50:06 - I do have people watching on the
50:07 - Instagram stream so if you're watching
50:09 - on Instagram and you're not sure what's
50:11 - going on I just was doing some live
50:13 - coding on the free code camp YouTube
50:15 - channel if you do have a question you
50:18 - can go join the live chat on there or
50:19 - you could put it in Instagram and I'll
50:21 - answer it from there as well
50:32 - okay so Zack asks what tech does free
50:35 - code can't challenges use wondering how
50:37 - hard it is to create your own challenges
50:39 - on your own site actually that's a good
50:42 - question I'm not really sure but there
50:44 - was an article on medium that I just
50:46 - read earlier today about a company that
50:49 - actually created their own version of
50:53 - free code camp so that they could host
50:55 - code challenges and have it be a little
50:57 - bit more fair because on free code camp
50:59 - basically you could you could look up
51:01 - all the answers they're available so
51:06 - they totally like clone it all and it's
51:09 - on github I wish I still had the article
51:12 - open I closed it out and I had to get
51:15 - hub repo open right before and I just
51:18 - closed it out so I don't have the link
51:19 - ready for you but if you check it out
51:21 - that the article was something like they
51:24 - introduced I think it was in was it
51:27 - Singapore I can't remember for sure but
51:34 - they'd introduced free code camp to like
51:37 - thousands of people during the Google
51:40 - i/o event that they had over there I
51:46 - think it's in the free code camp medium
51:50 - page so if you just scroll through there
51:53 - should be near the top but anyway
51:55 - that'll give you an idea cuz you can
51:56 - check out their repo and see what they
51:58 - did but I don't know a fan I I was not
52:01 - involved I guess you could just check
52:03 - out the free code camp repo - I don't
52:05 - know what I was thinking yeah everything
52:07 - in free code camp is open source so you
52:08 - can check out the github repo for that
52:11 - as well
52:13 - but I hadn't I was not involved at all
52:16 - in the making of any of the free code
52:20 - camp challenges so I I haven't even
52:24 - submitted any pull request to help out
52:26 - with that so it would be cool to do so
52:28 - I've just been as you all know pretty
52:31 - busy with with the work that I'm doing
52:33 - right now
52:39 - roman asks so we are going with v1 alpha
52:43 - or the the zero times to the other
52:46 - version so i think i'm gonna stick with
52:49 - the older version of material UI just
52:53 - because like what is this day six i had
52:56 - hoped to be farther along by day six and
52:58 - i spent a lot more time just trying to
53:02 - figure out what version we're going to
53:05 - use and then trying to get the beta
53:06 - version to work so i don't want to deal
53:09 - with that anymore i think the other
53:11 - version is it's way more stable it's
53:13 - been used by more people there's a much
53:16 - higher chance of me being able to find
53:18 - answers to issues that i have and i
53:20 - don't really have that with a beta
53:22 - version so it'd be really cool to use
53:24 - the beta version in the future but i
53:26 - just i don't think i'm gonna be able to
53:28 - do it for this project so all the effort
53:32 - that's put into making the beta version
53:35 - work by you all by your pull requests is
53:37 - not going to go to waste because i
53:39 - really do want to try to use it on a
53:41 - future project so when that happens i'll
53:43 - go back and pull out a lot of the the
53:46 - stuff that was done on that beta branch
53:49 - that we have for this project now so
53:52 - that will be helpful in the future but i
53:54 - just want to kind of let it mature a
53:56 - little bit before i before i use it
54:06 - Isaiah says I'm having difficulty
54:09 - rendering a PDF in a react react
54:11 - component that's interesting I've never
54:14 - attempted to render a PDF in a react
54:16 - component so I'm not really sure that I
54:18 - could offer you any advice on that right
54:22 - now but I am really interested in seeing
54:25 - it so if you have some code on github
54:28 - where you're trying to do that please
54:30 - send me a link to that you know you send
54:32 - me a direct message in Twitter if you
54:34 - want and I'll try to get to it when I
54:36 - can the charity truth right now I'm a
54:38 - little bit behind on getting to the code
54:41 - and stuff that people want me to review
54:42 - on on Twitter so if you do send me
54:47 - something to review I will definitely do
54:49 - my best to get to it at some point but
54:51 - there's there's a little bit of a
54:52 - waiting list right now so don't be
54:55 - afraid to send it but just if you need
54:58 - something reviewed like immediately
54:59 - that's it's probably just not going to
55:01 - happen
55:18 - yeah in the the person in the chat with
55:24 - the with the handle lol lol says when I
55:27 - said that stream was gonna be sure they
55:29 - said is it because I'm watching the
55:30 - stream you make it shorter well not at
55:33 - all no no it has to be short and I
55:36 - explained earlier why it has to be short
55:37 - so I have to I have to get somewhere
55:39 - it's really important that I that I get
55:42 - somewhere at this point it's it's a
55:45 - matter of professional pride that I
55:47 - figure out what is going on what's going
55:50 - wrong with my the site that I built and
55:54 - fix it and I really hope that I can go
55:57 - there and say no it's the browser it
56:01 - wasn't me at all that would be the
56:03 - best-case scenario because then it
56:05 - wouldn't have been my fault this entire
56:06 - time but even if it is my fault and
56:10 - there's some bug that I don't know about
56:11 - that would still be cool because then at
56:13 - least I figure it out and and be able to
56:14 - fix it
56:45 - okay about halfway through the live chat
56:48 - now
57:01 - okay so I see Sebastian saying some
57:04 - stuff about the the mouse over and stuff
57:11 - so yeah I'm not sure yes Sebastian sent
57:16 - me a message on Twitter or something
57:17 - about that because I'm not exactly sure
57:19 - what's going on in a live chat and I
57:20 - know I'm gonna have to stop so I really
57:24 - don't have time to talk about it right
57:25 - now because I'm gonna have to end the
57:28 - stream soon someone that just has the
57:35 - string so JH k k JH ka says what is card
57:40 - tag yeah so it's not a standard s it's
57:43 - not a standard tag right yeah it's no
57:44 - it's not a standard card it's a it's a
57:46 - react component it's a custom component
57:48 - so Sebastian answered that but in case
57:51 - anyone else was wondering the HTML yet
57:54 - it it has a lot of non-standard tags so
57:57 - in my editor these tags are highlighted
58:00 - a different color than the regular tag
58:02 - so you'll be able to tell you know that
58:05 - these are special ones but they're
58:07 - definitely not not your normal tags they
58:10 - react components
58:29 - advanced says you're right it shows up
58:31 - automatically okay so maybe I just
58:33 - needed to be more patient and this is in
58:35 - regard I think to the merge whenever it
58:38 - displays that your pool request has
58:42 - actually been merged so I just didn't
58:45 - wait long enough
59:04 - maxima is asking what do you what do you
59:06 - use and and not just to meet everybody
59:09 - in the stream what do you use to uglify
59:13 - es6 Jess
59:16 - okay so John says John Simona says grunt
59:22 - can trigger glyph i Maxima is using gulp
59:30 - yeah there's a gulp uglify you'd
59:35 - probably want to use babel first so i
59:38 - don't know if anybody said that but yeah
59:40 - if you want to do es6 i mean if you want
59:45 - to keep es6 and just uglify your es6 and
59:51 - not trans pilot I'm not really sure what
59:54 - you would want to do but if you want to
59:58 - transpile yes 60s 5 for browser
60:01 - compatibility and then uglify it then
60:04 - maybe that's a step you need to put like
60:06 - in your in your workflow use like I
60:09 - think there's a gulp Babel so you want
60:13 - to use gulp babble first trans pilot and
60:16 - then uglify the code that's been
60:19 - transpiled so hopefully that makes sense
60:26 - yeah otherwise I don't really know I
60:31 - don't really know this babble have
60:33 - something like that built in I don't
60:35 - know I'm not sure but it would be
60:37 - somewhat convenient I guess if it was
60:39 - alright so the stream on Instagram just
60:43 - ended so thanks if you're if you wanted
60:50 - to see my face today you missed it now
60:52 - but yeah the Instagram stream will be
60:56 - available for 24 hours
61:08 - okay Isaiah's asked again about
61:10 - rendering the PDF in the react component
61:12 - I'm assuming those before I talked about
61:15 - how like I honestly really don't know
61:17 - how to do that but you sent me a link to
61:22 - your repo I could at least check it out
61:31 - okay Maxim a said that it was for a note
61:36 - app so es6 was supported so it didn't
61:39 - really have to worry about transpiling
61:41 - so okay
62:10 - patrick said react inception so I guess
62:13 - that was when we were I was talking
62:14 - about passing in a component which I
62:20 - think I got rid of that but yeah yeah it
62:22 - is like reacting session
62:36 - all right Patrick said there's odd
62:37 - shifting happening to toggle and on
62:40 - toggle to sidebar and watch the layout
62:42 - let me check this up
62:50 - okay I'm not seeing any shifting happen
62:53 - here maybe I don't know maybe you're
62:56 - talking with someone else about their
62:57 - site in the live chat
63:07 - or possibly it's a different browser and
63:09 - so I'm not seeing it here
63:19 - Blake asks what time the stream will be
63:21 - tomorrow I'm thinking let me think I
63:27 - have a meeting at 11:30 so maybe around
63:33 - 10:00 Eastern Time maybe it earlier
63:36 - depends on what time I get into work
63:38 - tomorrow so I'm not sure but probably at
63:42 - the latest
63:43 - I'll start the stream around 10:00 so at
63:45 - least I can get in like about an hour
63:47 - before I gotta go to my meeting so
63:51 - that's that's what I'm thinking so I'll
63:54 - try to get in early schedule the stream
63:56 - so you all have a little bit of advance
63:58 - notice but I don't really have like a
64:03 - set start time where I have to be here
64:05 - by sowed it varies depending on like how
64:09 - many times I had to wake up with my kids
64:11 - in the middle of the night
64:20 - Alexander asked Jessie what would you
64:22 - recommend to improve react skills just
64:24 - started to use it I would say if you're
64:31 - like really really beginner at reacting
64:33 - just starting
64:34 - check out the react dog the official
64:36 - react documentation their tutorial some
64:39 - of it might be kind of too advanced but
64:41 - you know you'll get a rough idea of
64:43 - what's going on and then I would I would
64:46 - use codecademy x' that's like a
64:49 - browser-based course and that's kind of
64:52 - a nice introduction as well there's some
64:55 - YouTube videos that would be helpful so
64:57 - I think learn code Academy is the
65:01 - YouTube channel I think they have some
65:04 - some beginning react videos as well that
65:07 - can be kind of helpful they're a little
65:09 - bit dated though so just kind of keep
65:14 - that in mind like you get a good
65:15 - understanding of what react is but some
65:17 - of the syntax there might be better ways
65:19 - to do it now
65:21 - and then if you're willing to spend some
65:23 - money for a course so far the Udacity
65:26 - react nano degree that I'm taking
65:29 - currently has been really good so I
65:33 - recommend that rohan says we need no
65:39 - update tomorrow what's the issue browser
65:41 - bug it's a mystery yeah the issues
65:44 - completely a mystery to me as to why
65:47 - this isn't working so evidently from
65:49 - what I can gather just from a ton of
65:50 - emails and months of trying to figure
65:53 - out what's happening here is the way it
65:57 - works it's a password list login so I'm
65:59 - talking about this meeting that I'm
66:01 - about to have in a few minutes and it's
66:04 - not really a meeting it's me gonna I'm
66:06 - gonna go check out this person's
66:08 - computer I built a website that has a
66:14 - password list login system so you enter
66:18 - your email address and it has to be a
66:20 - Franciscan dot edu email address you
66:23 - enter that in and then it sends you an
66:25 - email with the link you click the link
66:26 - and you're logged in and it saves your
66:28 - login into local storage and your
66:30 - browser
66:30 - you stay logged in for a year unless
66:33 - somehow you delete the local storage
66:36 - when this person clicks the link to log
66:40 - in it takes them to a blank page at
66:42 - least that's that's what I've been told
66:44 - so I want to go check it out now they're
66:47 - the only reason I can think of that
66:50 - that's happening is the JavaScript error
66:52 - early on and so I'm guessing that it's
66:57 - either javascript is disabled on his
67:00 - browser for some reason which you would
67:02 - think would someone would know but I
67:04 - actually went to somebody else's office
67:06 - and checked there's their computer out
67:08 - because a similar thing was happening
67:09 - and that was the issue JavaScript was
67:11 - somehow disable they have no idea how it
67:13 - happened so it could be that or the
67:16 - issue could be they're using a really
67:17 - outdated browser so those are my best
67:21 - guesses right now but I would definitely
67:23 - fill you in tomorrow on on what I find
67:26 - out all right Patrick says react PDF
67:30 - component looks simple haven't used it
67:32 - but you might take a look at that so
67:34 - isaiah's was asking about PDFs and
67:38 - rendering PDFs and react so that's
67:41 - really cool I didn't even realize that
67:42 - there was a way to do that
67:47 - Johnson muda says install another
67:49 - browser to test that's also the problem
67:52 - so I don't have access to install
67:55 - anything on anyone's computers other
67:57 - than my own because all the computers
67:59 - are basically on lock my computer's not
68:01 - on lockdown because I'm a developer and
68:03 - that doesn't really make sense to lock
68:04 - my computer down but everybody else on
68:07 - campus can't install anything or update
68:09 - anything on their own without IT so I'm
68:12 - not really gonna even have a chance to
68:13 - do updates I have to call someone from
68:16 - the help desk here at the University and
68:19 - have them do it and I don't know it's
68:22 - kind of towards the end of the day so
68:23 - I'm not even sure if that's going to be
68:25 - reasonable to expect them to be able to
68:28 - you know update something or install
68:31 - something for me right away
68:36 - okay Umberto says check if it is
68:39 - Internet Explorer check compatibility
68:40 - mode to make sure they're not running in
68:43 - compatibility mode okay that's good to
68:45 - know
68:46 - I will definitely check that if I need
68:48 - to Roland says edge is actually good
68:57 - with standards unlike ie
69:00 - yeah I agree edge is way better than
69:03 - Internet Explorer Rowland also says
69:05 - Safari is worse nowadays yeah I agree
69:08 - probably my my least favorite browser
69:11 - that's like a modern browser and I don't
69:14 - include IE in that anymore since they
69:15 - came out with edge is definitely Safari
69:20 - so we had more issues with things not
69:22 - working in Safari than with pretty much
69:25 - any other browser
69:36 - okay so Patrick says I'm not seeing the
69:39 - issue with the layout on a Mac when it's
69:43 - strolling because the scrollbar doesn't
69:46 - change the width so I'll have to check
69:47 - that out I'll use browser stack to check
69:50 - it out probably tomorrow so thanks for
69:55 - that Patrick hopefully that's not gonna
69:57 - be like a really big issue
70:01 - okay all right I've gotten to the end of
70:05 - the live chat and definitely have to
70:09 - have to get ready and go now but thank
70:11 - you all for watching and helping out in
70:15 - the live chat and thank you for all the
70:17 - contributions and pull requests and
70:19 - everything I really appreciate that I'll
70:23 - be back tomorrow probably around 10 a.m.
70:26 - Eastern Time so different time than
70:29 - normal but I'll put out a tweet and I'll
70:32 - schedule it so you should get a
70:33 - notification through YouTube as well if
70:35 - you subscribe to this channel so I guess
70:39 - I'll see you soon
70:41 - else I'll see you in the morning and
70:43 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and it's we're going to start out today doing a going over a pool request and I was just testing it out so I've gotten pretty much nothing done since yesterday so we're gonna start right where we left off that so yesterday after I ended I just answer some emails talk to my boss a little bit and then left this morning I bet I've been in meetings all day so there actually have been interviewing someone for web developer position so we did an interview like a panel interview and then I just got back from doing a technical interview it was kind of cool because we actually used some free code camp challenges for the technical interview so I thought that was kind of fun and I've heard that other people do that as well so I don't know if it's a widespread thing but hey you know if you go through the free code camp challenges then you got a shot at maybe seeing it in an interview so might help you out also I got a comment on one of my videos saying that I should talk less and code more and I was actually thinking the same thing yesterday afternoon so I'm gonna try to do that I can't guarantee anything because as as you all know from watching a I do tend to talk so I'm gonna try to talk when I need to to explain what's going on in the code and then of course to answer questions but other than that I am going to try to do more code I let's see was I gonna say oh okay I do some silent streams on my own channel occasionally so if you really would rather just see the code and not worry about my commentary on the code check out those streams I don't really schedule them too far in advance I just kind of do it whenever I have some time here and there throughout the day so the best way to hear about them I usually tweet about them so if you follow me on Twitter you'll probably see the tweet or if you subscribe to my channel you'll get an alert but those are just like I said I don't schedule them it'll just happen and I'll do it until usually for like an hour or so until something comes up at work and I can't do it anymore alright so I'm gonna say hi to everyone in the live chat and I have some have some questions already a question have you ever had a female boss yeah I have so my my immediate supervisor is a male and then the director of my department and the executive director of my department are both women and I've worked for four women before so not not really a big deal to me okay also this video is going to be shorter than normal so I told you yesterday that I kept trying to go see this guy's computer and about an issue he's having with a website I made and it's it's on campus here and I I haven't been able to get a time it's the one that I thought possibly might be using Internet Explorer 9 so I got an email back from him saying that he'll be there around 4 p.m. so I'm not missing this opportunity I have to know what is really going on with this website he's saying he gets a blank screen and nothing happens at all which is crazy so I want to know so I definitely am gonna shoot for like being over around like 330 Eastern Time so maybe about an hour long stream I could probably go a little bit longer than that and still make it there but I don't want to take any chances alright so let me show you what's what's going on here I'm working on this error message right now so I have let's see this sidebar item J s is giving me an error no duplicate props allowed and I got this because if you notice these are now the same color which is awesome so that was a a pool request that I got from let me show you the pool request where do I have it okay so here's the pool request and alright so there's a one in the name so let me I think I I have a message on Twitter from this person as well so okay soul a late want I'm not I'm not really sure I pronounce it but sent this pool request so if you're watching let me know how to pronounce your name cuz I don't wanna get it wrong so basically as it says it customized the hover event okay so it just ended up using if you remember yesterday we were Sebastian was saying it's the the list item that needs to get the the hover but the list item was being created by the I think it was the menu item component yeah the menu item component so we couldn't access it directly so now let's just switch to using the menu item directly and it seems like everything works the same as it did before so that's not exactly how its said to do this side drawer and the documentation but it works so I think I'm gonna pull it in but before I pull it in I tested it and I got that error so I just want to work on that error first and then pull this in to the master branch and then we can continue on with our layout for everybody that's new joining I want to explain so if you're joining from Twitter I had said I'm using material UI and materialized CSS which may be a little bit confusing so we're using material UI and all the nice react components that it has but when there's a feature that it doesn't have that I like from materialized then I'm gonna pull that in so we've pulled in the column classes already and we're probably gonna pull in some other things like I like how they they do they're responsive font so we'll probably pull that in and we'll as we go along so we're gonna use a blend of the two and I have started the and rock server so let me I'm gonna paste that link in for you all so you can follow along and in case you can't see the live chat right now for some reason here is the link this one here I mean this one would work too I guess but this one's HTTPS which is better so I guess so why not alright so the links in the chat now so here we go you can see getting some activity there so let me know if anything goes wrong with that I won't be watching this as I code so if if it quits working please let me know and let's check out that error so it did say it was on line line 24 of the sidebar item which is right here so that's not actually before I let me open this back up if you remember I think yesterday we were having the problem where when I switch branches the code wasn't automatically changing which I'm almost positive that it did automatically change before but for some reason it's not so I'm gonna open that back up again just to see there we go now this makes a lot more sense okay so on line 24 we have this hover color okay so we see the hover colors here is red and the hover color down here is a different color so let's take out this hover color and that should fix the air because you know that that makes sense you shouldn't have to props that have the same name because that's confusing all right cool air is fixed there we go we still have these hairs which I don't wear these air is coming from it's where I get these errors all the time in production or in development but not in production so not worried about them right now so now that that works let's commit that and then merge this branch into the master branch so I am going to explain every time I do something on get our in the command line I'm gonna explain that for everyone who's not familiar with it so for those of you who are familiar with it if it's kind of annoying that I keep explaining this and you all know that I'm sorry but I'm gonna gonna keep doing it because I think it's better to explain it for the people that don't know it then than to not because otherwise they'll be really lost so we're gonna do git status just to doublecheck that we've only changed the component that we meant to change and we have in fact only changed that component and then we're gonna get commit a.m. and that the a means we're gonna add everything and we're going to include the message right in our command so it'll say remove remove duplicate props all right awesome and I'm going to merge this now so I've already merged master into that the other branch and I did the test there so maybe there's a better way to do it but I like to do it like that because that way if if something there's some weird errors and it breaks a lot of stuff when I merge it it's only broken that one branch and I haven't messed up master so then it's just easier to switch right back to master instead of having to worry about trying to roll back you know to a different version of it and then it's great because once you have it right and it's everything's fixed then you just switch over to master emerge and everything works so let's do that so we're gonna go get merge so when you merge you go to the branch that you want to merge the other branch into so I'm in master because I want to merge something into master I'm sure there's other ways to do it as well but this is the way I always do it and I'm gonna say what branch I want to merge into my current branch and in this case I want to merge what did I call that thinks the only Oberon all right awesome so you could see we had obviously no conflicts because that branch had already merged with master before or had master merge into it before so now we'll have double check make sure everything's working yes it is working and I'm gonna push this so we'll see if you've never seen how for requests works basically you you can see the merge completed right there pretty much realtime if I go get push origin master to push it out to get up now it's pushed there and I can't remember if it refreshes automatically or if I have to refresh the page I can't remember let me try a page refresh basically what should happen is it should say merged yep there we go it says merge so I guess you have not sure if you have to wait for the Refresh for some reason I thought I'd seen it just happen automatically before but maybe I didn't see that maybe I don't know what I'm talking about alright so that's another pull request so thank you for got a lot of pull requests for this project so far a lot of really good ones so I really appreciate that and let me show let me just throw up on the screen really quick the contributors so far so here we go here's our contributors so thank you to everyone who has contributed and actually yeah yeah that's everybody ok okay so let's continue on with our layout so I think I've decided the way I want to do this is just run through and get the base layout for every page and then I'll go in and work on just the details yeah I think it would be easier that way I'll get an idea for when we reuse things so when I go to handle changing the styles to make it work I'll have a better idea of you know if I change the style globally how it will affect another page and then otherwise if I go page by page I might decide to change so globally and then later on have to you know edit it and so it could end up being a bit more messy than it needs to be in the in the CSS so let's move on so this page is basically how we want it with the exception of I mean obviously this is still lorem ipsum text and everything but we'll fill that in logos I'm gonna skip logos for now because that's gonna be difficult I don't know it won't be that difficult it's not like we've never done anything like that before in react because we have but it's just gonna be a lot and since I want to keep it short today I'm not gonna get into that so the posters view we got to bring up our the project as it currently stands the current live version so we can see what we're but we need to to build out all right on my other screen I'm bringing it up and I'll just pull it over when it's ready also I am broadcasting on Instagram so it looks like that some people watching including my wife so hey thanks for watching actually I should I showed my kids one of the Instagram videos of me doing this and they were like the baby was just staring and smiling she was like a mace that I was in the phone and also sitting right there that was pretty fun alright so here's what we have currently live and this is behind a like a password password protected site so sorry you can't check this out right now it's not there's not really anything private in here that would require having a password but we just that's how it was set up so the new one won't require a password and we're looking at posters okay so we're just gonna need while this would be easy so basically the same thing that we did on the home page except a different little bit different organization of the cards so ready go to 2 columns and 3 rows so that's gonna be super easy we can copy and paste a lot of what we did for home so I'm gonna throw foam actually I already have it over there cool so we have home on this side so we can easily copy it and posters there we go let's bring up posters so I'm gonna copy all of this I'm just doublechecking okay all right I'm gonna copy that and we're just gonna have to change around the columns a little bit so right now we need to change all these m fours we need them to be M twos and I do want to change up these rows so we only had two rows before and now I want three rows so I'm gonna copy this and we need one two and then after this second column we're gonna put in this row we also need to close out the first row so we're gonna put a closing div tag all right so now we've started our row we don't have to close that because we'll just we're using the closing div that was in the other one so we can just delete this row right one two actually might have to add another one we can't keep it straight in my head so we have 1 2 in the first row and that is properly closed good Row two one let's get rid of that yeah okay row two one two and close it out and then finally one more one more row and that is oh that one is already closed out so this should work but save it and no error syntax error okay what do we do okay I probably just forgot to yeah I didn't copy this stuff at the bottom so we just need to close that return and our render now it should work no oh we didn't I didn't copy that either so we need to import our components that we're using so we need to import that from material UI but save it now now will it work yeah okay so it works it doesn't look exactly the one or two but we have the number of cards that we want so let me eat you see what's going on here so I'm even bring over a dev tools so you can all see what's going on and if you're checking out the site using the link that I shared to Endre you could inspect this as well if you want to all right so let's see we have a container the row the columns oh I I know what cuz I said M all right I'm sure you all caught that mistake and I just haven't looked at the live chat for a while but my mistake was I put M in my mind I was thinking like I wanted it to be half of the page and so for some reason it made sense to me that was somehow half but really the way it works is that you need to specify the number of call you wanted to take up out of 12 columns so 12 would be full width so I need to do 6 these are the materialized column classes so that should work now there we go now we have what we wanted and all right so that's it so we're good this page layout is fine like I said I'm I'm not gonna worry about this you we can already see having some sort of you know padding up here is gonna be necessary probably for every page so that's why I wasn't really worried about doing it at first until we get everything laid out and then I could see like okay well what element is gonna be the best to put that padding on that'll apply everywhere we need it and if there's somewhere where we don't need it then we want to make sure it won't apply there so let's move on posters letterhead see actually I just remembered I have my poem adora timer and I keep forgetting to use it so put that on there I don't think I mentioned this yesterday a day before but somebody made a Pomodoro timer in Java like a desktop Pomodoro timer and sent it to me to try out so I haven't gotten a chance to try it out yet but maybe I'll try it out and I think I want to try it out on my laptop and not on my work computer because well like the IT department gets a little bit upset about downloading things so not that I suspect anything from this app or the guy that sent me the app but just so that I don't possibly get in trouble I'm gonna try it out on my laptop see how it is and maybe maybe then install it here and show you all but let's check out what the letterhead view is supposed to look like and go back thank the letterhead oh okay so it seems like all right not too bad I have letterhead view is just some text and then each one of these is a card and so this is just an image alright so we'll just import the the cards will leave the media section of the card we need the title section and then we need the the action bar section of the card so there'll be a little bit different than the cards that we just used on the last page but the good news is I mean none of these are components that are foreign to material designs so they're all there they are all available for us to use so we would probably won't need to customize too much cool move that to the side and let's check out this leatherhead okay so within letterhead let's create actually let me bring in let me bring in what we just did for the posters because we're gonna we're gonna want rows of two and since we already have some rows of two then why not use them so we are gonna have to change the card significantly but at least we can keep all of the the column classes pretty much as is we'll just delete that last row so we'll take this row and get rid of it great and then let's import not only this will import that we will no longer need the card text so we'll get rid of that and then we'll check out the documentation for material UI and the cards and we need to add in card actions and card media Media and then we're gonna take out card text we don't need that or actually let's just do this put that we'll make that card actions get rid of all this lorem ipsum there we go and then let's check out the docs to see how we need to do this so within card actions we need to flat button so let's bring in that flat button let's see how that looks yeah that's that's pretty much what we want so let's bring in the flat button and then we'll also bring in this action and we only need one action some only gonna bring in one of these components there we go so we have our button the last thing we need to bring in is this card media so let's check out how it's done here so card media let's pull this and I don't really want the overlay though how do they do that not we're not gonna use the overlay but we are obviously going to have an image and this image is not gonna work all you know it's so we don't even have an images folder so we'll pull in we're pulling a photo from somewhere else but we want to place that above the title oops and I should have been doing this all along there we go paste that in and I'll copy this as soon as I remove this stuff so I don't want oh that's interesting I just want to want to show you all this because it's interesting so the props the overlay prop we're actually passing in a reactive component which is cool I don't think I've ever done that before so actually passing in another component with its own props as the props for the card media I don't know didn't know you could do that that's really cool okay so and our image all right let's see what did we try to use before that didn't work was it it was the Bill Murray stock photos didn't work right I think it was a course issue so we're not gonna be able to do that unfortunately I'd love to be able to use Bill Murray so I think I'm just gonna use unsplash so we can go to unsplash and I'm gonna check the proper dimensions here for that image so what dimensions are we using 509 by 659 is that really what dimensions I used 509 I mean I'm sure it's it's obviously responsive so it's gonna get bigger or smaller bucks 600 by 766 was the original like how do it I had to have gotten an image like premade like that cuz I can't I don't see how I would have made an image like that 600 by 776 okay yeah so let's get an image that's 600 by 776 so I want to get a random image because that's fun and then you don't get as bored looking at it and let's pop that in here and I can't ever remember which ones with and which ones height for this alright so this is a two by three so that must mean two is the height and three others with all right so the height was now I can't remember 600 by 770 okay so let's do alright let's let's try that let's see how this works oops we're yet no no it looks like I did some bad copy and pasting that let's check out what the problem is all right that should fix it I should be good I want to check to make sure our URL works before I copy it hmm looks like it didn't that's the problem that's odd I'm not even there we go cool you just took a little louder to come in alright so now that we know that works we're going to copy this as well and let's see I don't know it broke I didn't work last time and break this you know what I probably yeah I click the the button to add another one I still don't know why that would cause it to be broken but I did add another image when I need to ah now I'm getting a Corsair that's weird that I didn't get one before and now I'm getting one let me try let's see can you all see the images over n drop okay all right cool I'm saying it now no I don't like how the random image gives you the same random image since you're you know making a call for all of it if you have it I think if you have the components like loading in it at different times you can get them to have different images I've actually I've done it before where I'd have it pick a random number and then use that to grab an image so I just so that I could get random images all in the same load but in any case it doesn't really matter this is only what we needed to see was just to get the dimensions let's move it around just a bit cool all right it looks like yeah we definitely I'm just checking it again so we definitely have to do something about the padding in here but it'll be a little tricky because so we have proper padding between rows this is our row break so I'd like to have consistent padding so it may have to have some media queries there to make sure that you know if we're gonna add padding let's say to each column we want to make sure we take it away from the row right now I'm not worried about adjusting anything the last thing we need to do is add some text at the top so it looked like it looked here like we just had two paragraphs of text so let's just throw in two paragraphs inside we're gonna put it inside another row and then we're gonna have a column a full width column and then we'll put two paragraphs into that column and I'm gonna use I think it was Sarah that recommended the Bible if some site to use for lorem ipsum so I think we'd use Samuel Jackson if some I've used bacon ipsum before but since this is a Catholic University I think it would be better if I use Bible ipsum and I think the people that I work for would like it better if I use Bible ipsum as opposed to Samuel Jackson quotes so hi I just saw the the first quote that I saw in Bible if some of my other screen actually like spells out the one of the words for God that is to some groups of Jewish people as actually you're not really supposed to spell that out or say it so I'm gonna use a different verse out of respect for that and not not use that oh man I'm seeing it in so many places why is it giving me this is actually really weird the the Bible if some generator is giving me the the same so I would assume it would give me like random stuff but it's giving me the same stuff let's see if I put in two if it'll be different no it's the same thing fresh now I want a different quote am I missing something all right all right I'll try I will live some a different day because I don't want to spend a lot of time on that I mean you would you would assume that you would get different Bible clothes right I might I might have to make my own that sounds like a good side project oh I'll make my own because your says what is it freak out camp has the random quote generator project so I'm sure there's some API out there and that you can get bible quotes from or like scrape the site or something so let's add in let's just add in what we know we need and just generate some lorem ipsum oops we're gonna do a div with a class name I'm gonna see cool with the class name of oops Roe and we also want a div with the class name of column and then you wanna make that in s 12 and that means if you're using materialized that means on small screens is gonna take up 12 columns and I wanted always to take up 12 columns so I'm not gonna add anything else otherwise you would add like in this case we added on medium screens the N we want to only take up 6 out of the 12 columns so be 50% with now we're gonna add our P tag and eventually I guess said before I'll probably put in the float X class but I need to bring that in for materialized so I'm not gonna look for it right now but I like the flow text since I did this site originally I've read some articles on proper font size and I'm convinced now they larger font size is almost always better for readability so I currently on newer sites that I'm making I use a much larger font size than I had previously and the flow text is a nice response of font size and make sure that it's a decent size all right so I can generate lorem ipsum whoa that's long string let me I was hoping there'd be some setting that I could get to really easily to wrap that I might have to actually go into preferences hmm I thought there was a wrap setting I'm missing it why are you editor settings area all right so soft rap somebody had mentioned soft rap in a comment or something and I think it was I think it was Nathaniel so anyway yeah see how much nicer that is thanks to Daniel for bringing that up maybe I have it maybe it's on my laptop but I thought I had that enabled somewhere but I guess not so just we're gonna throw in the two paragraphs and all right cool so that looks looks like we have the layout that we want yep obviously we're gonna change change a little bit we don't need this card subtitle actually yeah let's take that out I didn't realize I have the card subtitle in there oh yeah actually the more I look at these components from material UI the more I like them a lot of these like options are really nice like things that I would build myself pretty much every time like adding a subtitle you know would just add a span and you know have to set all the properties to make it look like that it's really cool that that's built in but you don't want to subtitle right now so we're gonna take it out so I'm thinking that once I once I get the hang of material UI and really start to learn how it works I think I will like it all right cool so that page is done let's see that was letter at a share story next is that next dress here share story okay so currently for share story what we have is we actually have a card with a bunch of text and a four hmm I'm not exactly sure that I want to keep this in a card so I'm gonna go I haven't checked the live chat in a while so I am gonna check back here but I'm gonna ask a question first and hopefully you all can help me when it comes to material design generally you you don't use cards in this way right you would if you have pieces of content you know that that are gonna be separate and like it's okay to put those in cars but usually like in this case I'm essentially using the card as a container for everything that's on this page with the exception of the header so I don't really think this is the proper way to use it I think it may be better in this case to simply put this right on the screen kind of the paper in the background so I don't know what do you all think we could try to put this on the screen over here and see how it looks we'll have to bring in we haven't you worked with any form components yet so we'll have to bring that in so I think I think it's worth a try but let me check the time yeah actually at this point I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna go over to the live chat and that'll probably be all we get in today so we've done a couple of use the layout for it the next thing we'll probably do is bring in some of these components for forms and I'm at least gonna try out leaving out the card for this just to kind of more properly stick to the material design spec it's when I did this site I was I was just starting out with learning material design so I kind of used cars for everything okay so now if you were just here for the code part of it thanks for watching I'm gonna do a Q&A session now before I finish up so if you're not interested in sticking around for the questions and answers I'll see I'll be back tomorrow morning with another live stream so if you can join me then otherwise if you have a question put it in the live chat or you can ask me on any social media thing a lot of people ask me things on Twitter or you can put it in a comment on the video so let me scroll up to the top and I'm just going to get it on through actually I'm gonna see I'm just go back down to the bottom just to see if you all answered my question alright Rohan says an edgetoedge card okay all right John Hanson says I suggest a story card looks too much like a modal and so its function looks like a person would maybe want to dismiss it so yes resign okay cool I'd know I didn't think about that but now that you said it it does kind of look like it could be a modal cool okay Kevin says I think with a big enough font and responsive container it would look just fine on the paper on the back if you're not sure what we're talking about like when I say paper in material design language this background so behind the card is the paper right and certain things sit normally on the paper and this is what I didn't know when I made this site but like the print the copy the text here this font is considered ink okay so ink goes directly onto a paper it has no height to it right that's why we don't put box or we don't put shadows on on text in material design all right because it sits on the paper the same thing like with an image normally an image sits flat all right that's that's ink but then if certain things we can bring out all right look like a card but it would be better like we don't want to put everything on the card and it's weird so it makes it implies almost that we could move the card out or get rid of it or there's something behind it so anyway that I'm no expert on material design but at least that's my understanding so if you hear me say paper I basically just mean the background that you see I mean you can see the entire background here so this is we mean me the paper okay and Rohan says it feels like the description text is too large so are you talking about this text I'm not sure but anyway yeah this is this text that I have at the top of these pages might entirely go away it might end up uh I think I'd rather go with a really small header and then move these as to be like titles to each page so down here we'll see I'm I want to see how it looks kind of messed around with it okay so thanks for your your feedback those good feedback definitely agree with it so now I'm gonna go to the top and try to answer some questions and let's see also I do have people watching on the Instagram stream so if you're watching on Instagram and you're not sure what's going on I just was doing some live coding on the free code camp YouTube channel if you do have a question you can go join the live chat on there or you could put it in Instagram and I'll answer it from there as well okay so Zack asks what tech does free code can't challenges use wondering how hard it is to create your own challenges on your own site actually that's a good question I'm not really sure but there was an article on medium that I just read earlier today about a company that actually created their own version of free code camp so that they could host code challenges and have it be a little bit more fair because on free code camp basically you could you could look up all the answers they're available so they totally like clone it all and it's on github I wish I still had the article open I closed it out and I had to get hub repo open right before and I just closed it out so I don't have the link ready for you but if you check it out that the article was something like they introduced I think it was in was it Singapore I can't remember for sure but they'd introduced free code camp to like thousands of people during the Google i/o event that they had over there I think it's in the free code camp medium page so if you just scroll through there should be near the top but anyway that'll give you an idea cuz you can check out their repo and see what they did but I don't know a fan I I was not involved I guess you could just check out the free code camp repo I don't know what I was thinking yeah everything in free code camp is open source so you can check out the github repo for that as well but I hadn't I was not involved at all in the making of any of the free code camp challenges so I I haven't even submitted any pull request to help out with that so it would be cool to do so I've just been as you all know pretty busy with with the work that I'm doing right now roman asks so we are going with v1 alpha or the the zero times to the other version so i think i'm gonna stick with the older version of material UI just because like what is this day six i had hoped to be farther along by day six and i spent a lot more time just trying to figure out what version we're going to use and then trying to get the beta version to work so i don't want to deal with that anymore i think the other version is it's way more stable it's been used by more people there's a much higher chance of me being able to find answers to issues that i have and i don't really have that with a beta version so it'd be really cool to use the beta version in the future but i just i don't think i'm gonna be able to do it for this project so all the effort that's put into making the beta version work by you all by your pull requests is not going to go to waste because i really do want to try to use it on a future project so when that happens i'll go back and pull out a lot of the the stuff that was done on that beta branch that we have for this project now so that will be helpful in the future but i just want to kind of let it mature a little bit before i before i use it Isaiah says I'm having difficulty rendering a PDF in a react react component that's interesting I've never attempted to render a PDF in a react component so I'm not really sure that I could offer you any advice on that right now but I am really interested in seeing it so if you have some code on github where you're trying to do that please send me a link to that you know you send me a direct message in Twitter if you want and I'll try to get to it when I can the charity truth right now I'm a little bit behind on getting to the code and stuff that people want me to review on on Twitter so if you do send me something to review I will definitely do my best to get to it at some point but there's there's a little bit of a waiting list right now so don't be afraid to send it but just if you need something reviewed like immediately that's it's probably just not going to happen yeah in the the person in the chat with the with the handle lol lol says when I said that stream was gonna be sure they said is it because I'm watching the stream you make it shorter well not at all no no it has to be short and I explained earlier why it has to be short so I have to I have to get somewhere it's really important that I that I get somewhere at this point it's it's a matter of professional pride that I figure out what is going on what's going wrong with my the site that I built and fix it and I really hope that I can go there and say no it's the browser it wasn't me at all that would be the bestcase scenario because then it wouldn't have been my fault this entire time but even if it is my fault and there's some bug that I don't know about that would still be cool because then at least I figure it out and and be able to fix it okay about halfway through the live chat now okay so I see Sebastian saying some stuff about the the mouse over and stuff so yeah I'm not sure yes Sebastian sent me a message on Twitter or something about that because I'm not exactly sure what's going on in a live chat and I know I'm gonna have to stop so I really don't have time to talk about it right now because I'm gonna have to end the stream soon someone that just has the string so JH k k JH ka says what is card tag yeah so it's not a standard s it's not a standard tag right yeah it's no it's not a standard card it's a it's a react component it's a custom component so Sebastian answered that but in case anyone else was wondering the HTML yet it it has a lot of nonstandard tags so in my editor these tags are highlighted a different color than the regular tag so you'll be able to tell you know that these are special ones but they're definitely not not your normal tags they react components advanced says you're right it shows up automatically okay so maybe I just needed to be more patient and this is in regard I think to the merge whenever it displays that your pool request has actually been merged so I just didn't wait long enough maxima is asking what do you what do you use and and not just to meet everybody in the stream what do you use to uglify es6 Jess okay so John says John Simona says grunt can trigger glyph i Maxima is using gulp yeah there's a gulp uglify you'd probably want to use babel first so i don't know if anybody said that but yeah if you want to do es6 i mean if you want to keep es6 and just uglify your es6 and not trans pilot I'm not really sure what you would want to do but if you want to transpile yes 60s 5 for browser compatibility and then uglify it then maybe that's a step you need to put like in your in your workflow use like I think there's a gulp Babel so you want to use gulp babble first trans pilot and then uglify the code that's been transpiled so hopefully that makes sense yeah otherwise I don't really know I don't really know this babble have something like that built in I don't know I'm not sure but it would be somewhat convenient I guess if it was alright so the stream on Instagram just ended so thanks if you're if you wanted to see my face today you missed it now but yeah the Instagram stream will be available for 24 hours okay Isaiah's asked again about rendering the PDF in the react component I'm assuming those before I talked about how like I honestly really don't know how to do that but you sent me a link to your repo I could at least check it out okay Maxim a said that it was for a note app so es6 was supported so it didn't really have to worry about transpiling so okay patrick said react inception so I guess that was when we were I was talking about passing in a component which I think I got rid of that but yeah yeah it is like reacting session all right Patrick said there's odd shifting happening to toggle and on toggle to sidebar and watch the layout let me check this up okay I'm not seeing any shifting happen here maybe I don't know maybe you're talking with someone else about their site in the live chat or possibly it's a different browser and so I'm not seeing it here Blake asks what time the stream will be tomorrow I'm thinking let me think I have a meeting at 1130 so maybe around 1000 Eastern Time maybe it earlier depends on what time I get into work tomorrow so I'm not sure but probably at the latest I'll start the stream around 1000 so at least I can get in like about an hour before I gotta go to my meeting so that's that's what I'm thinking so I'll try to get in early schedule the stream so you all have a little bit of advance notice but I don't really have like a set start time where I have to be here by sowed it varies depending on like how many times I had to wake up with my kids in the middle of the night Alexander asked Jessie what would you recommend to improve react skills just started to use it I would say if you're like really really beginner at reacting just starting check out the react dog the official react documentation their tutorial some of it might be kind of too advanced but you know you'll get a rough idea of what's going on and then I would I would use codecademy x' that's like a browserbased course and that's kind of a nice introduction as well there's some YouTube videos that would be helpful so I think learn code Academy is the YouTube channel I think they have some some beginning react videos as well that can be kind of helpful they're a little bit dated though so just kind of keep that in mind like you get a good understanding of what react is but some of the syntax there might be better ways to do it now and then if you're willing to spend some money for a course so far the Udacity react nano degree that I'm taking currently has been really good so I recommend that rohan says we need no update tomorrow what's the issue browser bug it's a mystery yeah the issues completely a mystery to me as to why this isn't working so evidently from what I can gather just from a ton of emails and months of trying to figure out what's happening here is the way it works it's a password list login so I'm talking about this meeting that I'm about to have in a few minutes and it's not really a meeting it's me gonna I'm gonna go check out this person's computer I built a website that has a password list login system so you enter your email address and it has to be a Franciscan dot edu email address you enter that in and then it sends you an email with the link you click the link and you're logged in and it saves your login into local storage and your browser you stay logged in for a year unless somehow you delete the local storage when this person clicks the link to log in it takes them to a blank page at least that's that's what I've been told so I want to go check it out now they're the only reason I can think of that that's happening is the JavaScript error early on and so I'm guessing that it's either javascript is disabled on his browser for some reason which you would think would someone would know but I actually went to somebody else's office and checked there's their computer out because a similar thing was happening and that was the issue JavaScript was somehow disable they have no idea how it happened so it could be that or the issue could be they're using a really outdated browser so those are my best guesses right now but I would definitely fill you in tomorrow on on what I find out all right Patrick says react PDF component looks simple haven't used it but you might take a look at that so isaiah's was asking about PDFs and rendering PDFs and react so that's really cool I didn't even realize that there was a way to do that Johnson muda says install another browser to test that's also the problem so I don't have access to install anything on anyone's computers other than my own because all the computers are basically on lock my computer's not on lockdown because I'm a developer and that doesn't really make sense to lock my computer down but everybody else on campus can't install anything or update anything on their own without IT so I'm not really gonna even have a chance to do updates I have to call someone from the help desk here at the University and have them do it and I don't know it's kind of towards the end of the day so I'm not even sure if that's going to be reasonable to expect them to be able to you know update something or install something for me right away okay Umberto says check if it is Internet Explorer check compatibility mode to make sure they're not running in compatibility mode okay that's good to know I will definitely check that if I need to Roland says edge is actually good with standards unlike ie yeah I agree edge is way better than Internet Explorer Rowland also says Safari is worse nowadays yeah I agree probably my my least favorite browser that's like a modern browser and I don't include IE in that anymore since they came out with edge is definitely Safari so we had more issues with things not working in Safari than with pretty much any other browser okay so Patrick says I'm not seeing the issue with the layout on a Mac when it's strolling because the scrollbar doesn't change the width so I'll have to check that out I'll use browser stack to check it out probably tomorrow so thanks for that Patrick hopefully that's not gonna be like a really big issue okay all right I've gotten to the end of the live chat and definitely have to have to get ready and go now but thank you all for watching and helping out in the live chat and thank you for all the contributions and pull requests and everything I really appreciate that I'll be back tomorrow probably around 10 a.m. Eastern Time so different time than normal but I'll put out a tweet and I'll schedule it so you should get a notification through YouTube as well if you subscribe to this channel so I guess I'll see you soon else I'll see you in the morning and have a great day
