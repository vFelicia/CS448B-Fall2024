00:07 - hey everybody it's
00:09 - Jesse and uh happy Monday hope everybody
00:14 - had a good weekend uh at the end of last
00:17 - week I was working from home my streams
00:19 - were not not the same quality in terms
00:22 - of uh video quality so I could barely
00:27 - keep 720p I am back now
00:31 - in my
00:32 - office and uh so the quality in this
00:34 - stream should be a lot
00:37 - better today uh we're going to work on
00:42 - the masonry layout so at some point I
00:45 - think last week we uh we started working
00:48 - on this and we got to the point where it
00:51 - was working and it seemed like that was
00:55 - it uh I'll just have to do a few more
00:58 - things and and it would
01:01 - work but that's not that's not how it
01:04 - went so um I had some problems so I
01:08 - decided to do a part
01:11 - two to show those problems and hopefully
01:13 - fix them Today's show is going to
01:17 - be a little bit shorter than I have been
01:21 - doing so lately I've been doing really
01:23 - long uh shows because the the things
01:27 - we've been trying to get done have been
01:28 - a little bit more complicated
01:30 - and that's it's taking a while but I
01:32 - have a meeting at 3: uh 300 p.m. eastern
01:35 - time so in less than an hour so this
01:39 - definitely has to be less than an hour
01:42 - so I'll try to cut it off and start uh
01:44 - answering questions at at
01:48 - 2:30 and unless I can get this working
01:51 - sooner than that I don't I don't know
01:53 - maybe uh and then definitely be done you
01:57 - know before 3 so
02:00 - hey everybody we have some people in the
02:02 - live
02:03 - chat uh so how's it
02:08 - going hopefully the uh the lag time will
02:12 - be better too between when I say and do
02:14 - something and when when you all actually
02:17 - see
02:19 - it also have some upgrades um I got that
02:23 - new microphone hooked up on my work
02:25 - machine now so let me know if it doesn't
02:28 - sound good
02:31 - um I'm hoping that this is better sound
02:33 - quality than just the mic that comes
02:35 - with an iMac so if it's not I definitely
02:39 - want to know and and I can return the
02:40 - mic and maybe get a better one or just
02:42 - stick with what I
02:44 - had
02:47 - and oh the other big piece of exciting
02:50 - news that I have is I just upgraded my
02:52 - ram in this iMac so I have double the
02:54 - ram so that's always fun
02:58 - um I I've noticed it is slightly faster
03:01 - so we'll see the real test will be when
03:03 - I have a million tabs open and uh we'll
03:06 - see if it if it still holds
03:09 - up but let me um let me show you the
03:13 - problem that I'm having
03:19 - and where' it go sorry I just had it oh
03:23 - okay so let me show you the issue first
03:26 - I got to go in so we're on a branch so
03:28 - let me do a get
03:31 - checkout so if you're not familiar with
03:33 - Git You can make these branches which
03:35 - are basically like alternate versions of
03:38 - your um of your app or of your site and
03:42 - you can just switch between them so
03:44 - they're like they're like parallel
03:46 - universes in programming uh so if you
03:50 - you can try out some crazy thing on one
03:52 - branch and it doesn't matter if you
03:53 - totally mess it up because you switch
03:54 - back to your master branch and
03:56 - everything is is like it like it should
03:58 - be and you can use that to push um
04:02 - depending on how your deployment is you
04:04 - know that could be the the branch that's
04:06 - stable uh and you actually push out to
04:08 - your server
04:10 - so I'm going to switch to the masonry
04:20 - branch
04:23 - and now we should be able to
04:28 - see I'm going to bring up the site on
04:33 - I'm on my other screen right now
04:35 - bringing it
04:36 - up
04:37 - um what page resources
04:44 - okay so here we go here's the page right
04:48 - and look it looks like masonry is is
04:51 - working this is what we were left with
04:53 - you know last week after we got this
04:56 - going but when I click this tab you can
05:00 - see definitely not working and this is
05:02 - actually even worse than what it
05:04 - normally gives me usually I can at least
05:06 - get like this layout but the Footers
05:09 - back here but uh this time I couldn't
05:12 - even get
05:13 - that let me see yeah okay so here's what
05:16 - I normally get something like
05:18 - this
05:20 - so that's obviously not what we want and
05:25 - also I haven't tested the images yet I'm
05:27 - assuming that'll work it talks about it
05:29 - in documentation
05:31 - for um the react uh component that we
05:35 - use and this is the component in case
05:37 - you you weren't watching uh when we
05:39 - first started this I'm using react
05:41 - masonry component and um this is a react
05:45 - component that that uses the masonry uh
05:48 - Library if you're familiar with masonry
05:50 - or isotope it's used on a lot of sites
05:54 - uh to get you know this kind
05:57 - of kind of effect you know all these are
06:00 - just positioned uh with JavaScript you
06:03 - know and so each one as As you move the
06:06 - page around the position changes so you
06:09 - always have you know kind of nice even
06:11 - spacing between
06:14 - everything
06:16 - so the problem is really I need to
06:19 - refresh the layout somehow uh when the
06:22 - tab is
06:24 - clicked
06:26 - and I think I I ran into this issue on
06:29 - on a site I did before but I wasn't
06:31 - using the react plug uh the react
06:35 - component I was using just
06:37 - masonry um you know just the the
06:40 - JavaScript plugin by itself so I had
06:43 - access to you know to everything that
06:45 - you can do with that so there was a way
06:47 - to just kind of refresh things when you
06:49 - when you press the
06:51 - tab so that's kind of what I need to do
06:54 - at least what I think will fix this
06:56 - problem but I haven't been able to
06:58 - figure out how how to do
07:01 - it uh there's not really at least on on
07:06 - the documentation here I have not
07:10 - seen how to do
07:12 - that I did find something in the
07:20 - issues yeah they have these triggers so
07:23 - like on images loaded on layout complete
07:25 - on remove complete so I don't really
07:27 - need the trigger I will need images
07:29 - loaded at some point
07:33 - but I don't need the uh the
07:39 - trigger what I need is you know that
07:42 - that refresh so does that make
07:48 - sense all right I'm just I'm checking
07:50 - the live chat just for a second so I
07:52 - have uh more people in here now uh
07:54 - talking
07:56 - so oh okay uh Sebastian says there's
07:59 - some weird Statics on oh you know what I
08:01 - have forgot to turn my fan off let me
08:03 - turn the fan off and see if that helps
08:06 - uh it's a little bit warm in here today
08:08 - so hopefully that that helps it was a
08:11 - oscillating fan so I imagine when the
08:13 - fan was blowing right on the mic uh that
08:16 - probably made the
08:25 - noise oh okay saying so it's probably
08:27 - not the fan
08:31 - it was some other s okay let
08:35 - me definitely not the fan so all right
08:38 - so if it's still happening oh someone's
08:41 - saying it was the fan let me I'm going
08:43 - to do a little bit more at least with
08:44 - that
08:48 - mic and just see if it keeps happening
08:51 - uh if not if it's gets really bad let me
08:54 - know and then I'll just uh switch to the
08:57 - uh to the internal mic and
09:00 - um yeah I'm I'm not sure it wasn't a
09:03 - really expensive mic uh so I read some
09:06 - of the reviews uh on Amazon said that it
09:09 - was better than the internal mic so I
09:11 - thought I'd give it a
09:14 - shot and um we'll see maybe uh maybe I
09:18 - need to go with something a little bit
09:20 - more expensive a little better
09:28 - quality
09:32 - okay
09:34 - so what I'm going to do is
09:37 - um I'm going to go to these
09:42 - issues
09:48 - and trying to I should have um I think I
09:52 - still have the issue open on my laptop
09:54 - and I should have checked that
09:58 - out
10:00 - layout
10:02 - complete H that's not it's not exactly
10:05 - what I want to
10:07 - do
10:11 - um can't remember what the issues
10:18 - are I may be able to just look at what
10:22 - tabs are open on my laptop right
10:25 - now
10:27 - and just open it from
10:38 - there there we go so I'm just going to
10:41 - open the um the
10:46 - issues from my tabs all right nice
10:49 - that's a nice feature if you're using
10:51 - Chrome and you're logged in on multiple
10:54 - devices uh you can see what's open on
10:56 - all of them so uh I on my other screen I
10:59 - just opened some some of the issues
11:05 - that that had to do with at least some
11:10 - somewhat had to do
11:13 - with the issue that we're dealing
11:24 - with okay so this is what let me bring
11:27 - this over this is what I found that I
11:30 - think might help
11:33 - so and I couldn't get this to work uh
11:37 - maybe late last week I was working on it
11:41 - and basically you can bind this instance
11:45 - of
11:46 - masonry and then you can you should be
11:50 - able to do something like this you know
11:52 - this masonry on layout complete and you
11:56 - know do
11:57 - something
12:01 - so I couldn't get I couldn't get it to
12:04 - the point where I could bind it and
12:06 - actually access this it kept telling me
12:08 - you know like this you know doesn't
12:11 - exist
12:15 - so let me
12:17 - check let's go to our
12:22 - code and we're on the resources
12:25 - page let me make this a bit bigger for
12:28 - you all
12:32 - and I don't really need this right
12:34 - [Music]
12:37 - now and I don't
12:42 - need I don't need that side pen all
12:45 - right so P that'll give us more
12:48 - space okay so you see we have M these uh
12:52 - components now on just the first two
12:55 - tabs so the the tab that has everything
12:58 - and then the the tab that just has the
12:59 - audio
13:01 - cards uh you know we have masonry here
13:06 - we're going to try to
13:09 - add
13:14 - these we're going to try to add
13:17 - this on one of them just to see if we
13:21 - can get something get something
13:27 - going
13:33 - okay
13:35 - um then we should be able to call
13:37 - something like this
13:41 - so let's just let's just copy this I
13:44 - know this this isn't exactly what we
13:45 - want to do right now but this will be a
13:48 - good first
13:49 - step uh so I'm just going to go up here
13:51 - and put actually I already have
13:53 - component did Mount so I don't need to
13:55 - copy the whole
13:57 - thing
14:03 - okay so there's masonry on layout
14:07 - complete
14:11 - let's all right so I guess we'll do we
14:14 - we will put a layout complete
14:18 - Handler and let's just do something
14:21 - simple
14:22 - like
14:27 - um
14:35 - all
14:38 - right let's save that and
14:42 - hopefully hopefully we'll see that uh I
14:46 - was just wondering about with server
14:47 - side rendering maybe
14:50 - um no it shouldn't worry because well
14:54 - we'll see we'll test
14:56 - it
14:57 - uh
15:00 - there we go back here and I'm going to
15:05 - inspect this so we can see the
15:10 - console and first I want to click just
15:13 - to see if there's any difference now so
15:16 - you see whatever
15:19 - tab that's pretty odd now I'm have I
15:23 - have these things appearing
15:26 - H what did we do here
15:45 - that's really weird I'm going to refresh
15:46 - this because i' I've never had that I
15:49 - don't know why that's
15:57 - happening
16:10 - okay I'm going to check the live chat
16:11 - see if someone did I put
16:15 - okay uh so good uh so Patrick in the
16:18 - live chat mentioned I must have that in
16:23 - the in the
16:25 - jsx where do I have that should
16:32 - be
16:33 - oh you're right I I must have
16:36 - accidentally put that oh I know what I
16:38 - did um I pressed uh the the wrong key
16:43 - when I was trying to close this pain the
16:45 - um command slash like
16:51 - um I guess it be like the back slash I
16:54 - can't ever remember which one's forward
16:55 - slash and which one's back slash but one
16:57 - of them makes a comment and the other
17:00 - one toggles this pain on the side so I
17:04 - pressed the wrong one and didn't realize
17:05 - that I commented that okay so that fixes
17:08 - that uh not really our problem that
17:11 - we're trying to deal with but good catch
17:13 - on that Patrick thank
17:25 - you okay I did have a question about
17:28 - masonry is but it looks like it got
17:30 - answered um in the live chat
17:38 - so uh in case you are just joining um M
17:43 - and you have the same question masonry
17:46 - layout is I mean this this is what it is
17:48 - what it ends up looking like where you
17:50 - you can have uh content of different
17:52 - heights uh you can even have different
17:54 - widths if you wanted to um and then it
17:57 - all Lays out nicely with you see there's
18:00 - always uh the same space between them
18:03 - you know on all sides uh and
18:06 - it you know it keeps that space no
18:08 - matter what uh so you see as we do this
18:11 - our our width and height
18:13 - changes but it still it still works so
18:16 - that's basically a masonry layout so and
18:18 - then there's a JavaScript plugin called
18:21 - masonry that we're also
18:27 - using all right so what I'm not
18:31 - getting
18:34 - is any any
18:37 - logging from what we wanted here so we
18:40 - wanted this console log layout complete
18:43 - Handler this layout complete Handler
18:44 - okay so this should
18:46 - have it should have done
18:49 - something although now I don't remember
18:51 - when we
18:53 - do I just want to test this
18:57 - because I'm not sure with our server
19:00 - side rendering if I should even see this
19:02 - on the on the client
19:05 - side maybe if I
19:11 - um maybe if we do our client side
19:14 - routing and uh then we'll see that I'll
19:17 - give it a try either
19:19 - way so first I'll I'll do a hard refresh
19:22 - and this should give us the
19:25 - um the completely rendered h
19:33 - HML it's assuming
19:36 - my I'm going to just restart this so I
19:39 - still I know I've said this several
19:41 - times but I still haven't figured out
19:43 - what the issue is with why uh my Dev
19:47 - server just
19:49 - keeps like
19:51 - hanging
19:52 - um it's starting to get pretty annoying
19:55 - so I think I'll I'll figure it
19:57 - out okay so I did
20:00 - get let me bring this over here and show
20:03 - you that I did actually
20:07 - get that console log
20:10 - so so we can see that that actually did
20:13 - work so what should have happened is we
20:15 - should have got those three exclamation
20:18 - points that are
20:21 - in that are here layout complete Handler
20:25 - I'm just double-checking that I spelled
20:27 - everything right yeah so this should
20:29 - have worked because our
20:34 - layout our layout should have been
20:39 - complete
20:41 - um I wonder if there's some issue with
20:45 - me using uh two
20:48 - instances of of
20:51 - masonry let's see let me um I'm going to
20:54 - switch it to this one just to check you
20:57 - know maybe
20:59 - see if we have any luck with the with
21:01 - the first one instead of the second
21:03 - one the
21:07 - um the hot module reloading does some
21:09 - weird things sometimes like
21:14 - that okay so I did get it this time so
21:18 - that we so we got these exclamation
21:20 - points this
21:22 - time uh so that's what we
21:25 - wanted I'm going to click click around
21:29 - here see if I can get him
21:36 - again scroll
21:40 - up oops wrong page we're on resources
21:43 - right there we go that's why I didn't
21:45 - get it okay so I did get it again so
21:47 - both when we do
21:50 - um I'm going to do a hard refresh double
21:52 - check that great so the client side
21:57 - routing we still get this so it it Bas
21:59 - so it works for some reason though it
22:03 - did not work when we had it on the
22:05 - second masonry
22:08 - element that's not good
22:10 - news so you need to be able to use this
22:13 - multiple times or else I have to rethink
22:15 - how this is laid
22:18 - out plan B could be if I need to if I
22:23 - can't get this to work with with
22:26 - multiple um instan of this masonry
22:29 - component on the same page then if I
22:31 - need to all of them could be within one
22:34 - masonry component and then we could do
22:37 - some sort of
22:42 - sorting some kind of sorting where I can
22:46 - pick
22:48 - um pick the categories and they all just
22:51 - all the cards are just shown in in head
22:54 - I don't know if masonry can do that
22:58 - right off the bat I'll have to check I
22:59 - know isotope which is a JavaScript
23:02 - plugin built by the same guy that built
23:05 - masonry isotope does do some cool things
23:07 - with sorting so I have to check that out
23:10 - isotope though is not free to use so may
23:13 - have to buy buy a um a license for that
23:18 - uh and then see if it works with this
23:20 - with this
23:22 - component uh I'm going to see
23:26 - thoughts
23:28 - actually uh bro
23:31 - bromo Matic uh says were you calling
23:34 - both of them this masonry actually no I
23:37 - was just using one at a time my next
23:40 - step was going to be okay do we need to
23:43 - call these different things
23:52 - um yeah I I guess that could be the next
23:56 - step let's see if we
24:09 - can yeah let's see if we can do
24:11 - something like that where we just give
24:13 - this a
24:18 - um I'm just going to put a two on the
24:20 - end I probably will not keep that keep
24:23 - that naming but uh for now we'll see if
24:26 - it works
24:55 - all right so let's see what we're going
24:56 - to get wow
24:58 - I don't know I really need to um figure
25:01 - out what is going on with
25:04 - my wow
25:07 - okay all right well I can at least see
25:10 - something I'm still getting this but I'm
25:11 - not getting um that second
25:14 - one and what force Reflow ask
25:22 - JavaScript all right so I haven't really
25:24 - seen this happen
25:26 - before
25:29 - so I'm guessing that whatever I just did
25:33 - here with this is not going to work
25:37 - out yeah I mean it's not like I did
25:39 - anything different all I did was just
25:41 - add this in a second time and then up
25:45 - here yeah I just added this there's
25:47 - nothing in here that I see that really
25:50 - should have caused this so
25:55 - um let me check one do another page just
25:58 - to verify that it's it's something on
26:02 - that page that's doing
26:07 - it actually maybe it's maybe I do need
26:10 - to restart the
26:11 - server
26:15 - um all right we'll try it one more time
26:18 - I don't really have at this point much
26:20 - hope that I can get both of them working
26:23 - so it may have to just think of some
26:24 - something
26:26 - else
26:32 - while I'm okay that should be up
26:36 - now Vlad asked Sublime Tex or adom which
26:40 - program better to use thanks uh I've
26:43 - never use Sublime so I can't really say
26:46 - I do I like Adam it
26:49 - is I've noticed Adam is slower than like
26:54 - Visual Studio
26:55 - code uh so
26:58 - I can't compare it to Sublime you know
27:00 - myself I've heard that sublime's a lot
27:04 - faster I mean I I like
27:08 - Adam I'm open to switching to something
27:10 - else though it's just hard to switch
27:12 - when you have all your packages set up
27:13 - the way you want
27:20 - them Okay it definitely is that page so
27:23 - let's take this out
27:26 - then
27:31 - we
27:51 - at all right
27:54 - since since the way that is given in the
27:58 - documentation to Target a specific
28:00 - component seems like at least at this
28:03 - point it only works if I put it on the
28:05 - first instance of this component then I
28:08 - think I'm this is a dead end that I'm
28:09 - trying to go down here
28:12 - um so we need to switch it and try
28:16 - something else okay so I'm just going
28:23 - to I'm G to kind of mess everything up
28:26 - here
28:40 - yeah so since this first instance is
28:46 - really all I
28:48 - need it'll it'll contain everything
28:51 - there are reasons that I wanted to split
28:53 - it out like this one of them being that
28:55 - um there's a limit
28:58 - by default on how many um how many posts
29:02 - you can get back when you make an API
29:04 - call to Wordpress which is what the uh
29:06 - all this content is where it's coming
29:09 - from so uh I thought it would just be a
29:11 - lot easier
29:13 - if at some point I could make separate
29:16 - calls for each one of these
29:18 - but there are other ways to get around
29:22 - that and I think that's an easier
29:24 - problem than trying to dig into this
29:27 - component and see see what I need to do
29:31 - so
29:34 - let's oops I forgot to take out the
29:37 - stuff at the top
29:40 - and something up here
29:43 - was messing this
29:52 - up so
29:55 - hopefully this will work now
29:58 - great okay so that works um now we have
30:03 - everything here of course these are not
30:06 - going to work anymore so what we need to
30:09 - do then is have some other way of
30:12 - switching these
30:15 - out uh which I think we can we
30:20 - can figure that out in where' I put
30:26 - that
30:28 - okay so let me
30:30 - search I know I saw somebody
30:36 - else pretty sure so somebody
30:40 - else how to filter select item just like
30:43 - example there we go I think that's the
30:44 - one we
30:48 - need it's SL slow all
30:56 - right
31:07 - H okay so it looks like there's not a
31:09 - built-in filter like with with
31:13 - isotope
31:23 - um all right so here's
31:26 - what
31:29 - I think we'll have to do
31:33 - then let me check this one as
31:36 - well was that one
31:51 - isotope
31:56 - Maybe
31:59 - so it looks like they do have a branch
32:00 - that works with
32:11 - isotope all right let me go back I'm
32:13 - going to check the live chat see if
32:15 - anyone has any
32:26 - ideas
32:29 - okay uh bromo mtic says maybe have one
32:32 - masonry component and clicking on the
32:34 - the all audio you know video buttons
32:37 - will change as the filter inside that
32:39 - one that one
32:45 - instance yeah I think that's that's
32:48 - probably what what needs to
32:56 - happen
33:00 - okay
33:17 - so let me look at I I want to see what
33:21 - the uh Json looks like here to see what
33:23 - I
33:25 - can what I can filter by I don't
33:28 - remember what I called everything so
33:30 - we're going to take a look at
33:55 - that
34:01 - okay I'll bring this over so you can see
34:03 - what I'm looking at um here's
34:06 - [Music]
34:07 - our here's the data that we're
34:10 - getting uh we're actually not getting
34:12 - this much I am narrowing it down a bit
34:16 - um you can see we're getting that up
34:19 - here uh so we're making this call here
34:23 - and we're actually just getting the
34:24 - title and then these custom fields that
34:26 - we set up
34:27 - [Music]
34:29 - um so in these custom Fields okay so I
34:33 - do have a field called type so this is
34:36 - what we need to check
34:47 - for okay
34:52 - so
34:55 - let's
35:02 - so I think I do want them all to show up
35:04 - at first so that this is going to stay
35:06 - the same this is going to be the first
35:08 - the first load uh what's going to happen
35:11 - then is when we
35:13 - click so let's add a click where's our
35:25 - tabs
35:31 - oh here there sorry I was looking at the
35:33 - wrong one this is what we want this is
35:35 - has all of them here's our tabs uh so
35:38 - let's
35:38 - see we'll put a
35:43 - click on click that's how it is in react
35:47 - right it's just it's on
35:55 - click
35:58 - I'm I'm checking the uh live chat just
36:02 - quickly Thor says no idea about
36:04 - front-end development especially not
36:06 - with react can't help sorry it's all
36:09 - right
36:13 - um uh Mark ask what is isotope okay so
36:16 - isotope is um just a a JavaScript uh
36:20 - plugin
36:22 - that sorts out you can sort out uh HTML
36:26 - elements um in like a grid so think like
36:30 - um like Pinterest like how it's all laid
36:32 - out in a grid like this uh so like this
36:36 - but isotope lets you like let's say I'd
36:38 - click on these and it would just sort
36:40 - them on the Fly uh so they would all you
36:43 - know come in and come out and Resort and
36:44 - everything uh really easily it can do
36:46 - other stuff too but that's mainly what
36:48 - I've used isotope
36:54 - for yeah actually Sebastian has a good
36:57 - point plan C I can just use masonry
36:59 - client
37:03 - side that's actually
37:06 - not that's not a terrible idea uh that's
37:10 - that might be a good
37:13 - idea I'm going to take a second to just
37:15 - think what would be the fastest way so I
37:18 - the the most to me the best way would be
37:22 - to me to figure out how to do this like
37:24 - the react way right uh with with within
37:26 - that
37:27 - context but a way to do it that would
37:30 - definitely work and it might it might
37:32 - make sense to just get this working
37:34 - right now uh and then work on the other
37:36 - stuff later on would be just to use
37:39 - masonry as on its own without being you
37:43 - know imported you know via this react
37:45 - masonry
37:47 - component
37:49 - um and
37:53 - then then I would have access to
37:56 - everything
38:01 - let's just do that because otherwise I
38:04 - don't think there's any way I'm going to
38:05 - get this to work right now since I well
38:07 - since I've never done it before and I've
38:09 - done the other way before
38:12 - so if I have any chance of getting this
38:14 - working today I doesn't have to be
38:16 - working today but I'd like for it to be
38:18 - working today then I'm going to go with
38:20 - Sebastian's suggestion so here's what
38:23 - we're going to do we're going to go to
38:25 - Masonry
38:28 - there we go we go to the Mason website
38:31 - and I'm going to just pull in everything
38:34 - from the CDN for
38:39 - now
38:44 - and because that'll be the
38:47 - fastest that way I don't have to
38:49 - download anything and we can just try it
38:50 - out and see if it
38:52 - works so I'm going to throw this it I
38:55 - guess it doesn't even really matter
38:56 - where I put this um just put it in
39:00 - here uh let me take out this react
39:04 - masonry
39:05 - component and let's take
39:09 - out where we've used masonry here and
39:12 - let's just make this a
39:21 - div
39:25 - and
39:27 - I don't even need this div actually
39:28 - let's just take it
39:34 - out okay so we don't need that div
39:39 - and
39:41 - column okay so we're going to S on the
39:43 - column um let's
39:48 - grab I think that's it I think that's
39:50 - all we need let's let's remove this I'm
39:52 - just trying to get rid of everything so
39:53 - we don't get any
39:55 - errors
40:03 - don't need that
40:07 - okay um so this is wow what did I
40:22 - do and I need to add
40:25 - these
40:27 - these other things in as well at some
40:29 - point um so we need to add back our
40:33 - categories because we're going to be
40:34 - able to use uh the the tabs like we were
40:37 - hopefully um we can get that to
40:52 - work so let me I'm just going to copy
40:55 - and paste on my other uh monitor I'm
40:58 - just going to copy and paste from the
41:00 - get repo what we have on the master
41:02 - Branch because that'll that's basically
41:04 - what we
41:10 - need I either could do that or I could
41:12 - just hold down you know command Z for
41:15 - like a minute and it would probably get
41:16 - us back to where we wanted but I'd still
41:18 - have to change out the uh masonry
41:25 - components
41:32 - okay Patrick said there was some audio
41:34 - static so it it for sure was not the fan
41:37 - which which is what we thought uh that
41:40 - it wasn't the fan anyway
41:43 - [Music]
41:45 - so I may be returning this
41:51 - microphone because I definitely don't
41:53 - need the
41:55 - static
42:03 - all right the microphone I really wanted
42:05 - was not the one that I got anyway so I
42:08 - don't know if I can justify buying the
42:10 - one that I really
42:11 - wanted but I think it's like a 100 bucks
42:15 - it's not like an insane amount of money
42:20 - but you know it's not really necessary I
42:23 - think everybody could hear me with the
42:24 - built-in mic all right so we
42:29 - have here's everything and oh man that
42:32 - was ugly uh they just copied in really
42:38 - really ugly looking
42:40 - so that's
42:42 - better okay so let's save that
42:46 - and just verify that this is
42:52 - working oh that's what was happening I
42:55 - left that on click and
42:57 - there U sorry I'm scrolling around
42:59 - really fast I hope I'm not making
43:01 - anybody like motion sick that would
43:04 - probably make me motion sick if I were
43:08 - watching I do I need to keep an eye on
43:11 - the time and not forget about that I
43:12 - should have set an alarm but I did
43:16 - not uh okay 242 I can go for maybe about
43:20 - 10 more minutes it doesn't look like
43:22 - there's really
43:23 - any um any questions as I'm kind of
43:27 - scrolling around or at least I did
43:30 - answer a few questions as we were going
43:33 - so
43:34 - uh so we may not even really have a a
43:38 - kind of question
43:40 - answer uh session at the end of this
43:42 - video like we normally do uh because it
43:45 - doesn't look like there's any questions
43:46 - if you do have questions uh throw them
43:47 - in there now uh into the live chat and
43:50 - then that way I know and I'll um I'll
43:52 - try to end early enough so that I could
43:54 - get to them
43:59 - and uh as always if you uh don't get
44:01 - your question in in the live chat if
44:03 - you're watching later or something then
44:06 - you
44:08 - can okay this is it this this looks bad
44:11 - but this is what it should look like uh
44:12 - then you can always put it in the
44:14 - comments on the video or you can uh
44:17 - message me on Twitter and I'll answer
44:19 - you uh whenever I get a chance so I do
44:22 - answer everybody all the comments and
44:24 - everything and any messages anybody
44:26 - sends me I do answer it sometimes it's a
44:28 - few days before I can get to it but uh I
44:31 - definitely try to answer uh every
44:33 - question all right so that's what we
44:35 - want it to look like right
44:37 - now so now since we've imported uh
44:42 - masonry
44:44 - here now
44:47 - let's initialize
44:50 - it I don't really want to initialize it
44:52 - with jQuery even though I could I'd
44:54 - rather just use uh van
44:57 - uh
44:58 - JavaScript cuz I'm
45:03 - not I guess I'm let me grab this element
45:07 - argument if
45:12 - you yeah this is what I
45:16 - need
45:18 - okay so we'll do it in component did
45:22 - Mount
45:24 - um
45:27 - let's call this and then make
45:40 - this actually do I need to
45:43 - say I probably need to do that right let
45:46 - me know if that's uh the case but I
45:49 - think I do need to do that um now we can
45:52 - paste this in
45:54 - here and and I can change
46:01 - these cons just to keep it
46:05 - consistent and the query
46:10 - selector
46:12 - is it's going to be
46:18 - row
46:23 - no yeah it will be
46:27 - it will be row because each one is going
46:28 - to be its own sorry I'm thinking out
46:30 - loud here um normally you would have you
46:33 - know
46:35 - one you know one encompassing element
46:38 - for everything but in this case we're
46:40 - going to have multiple
46:42 - so yeah it would be row actually I
46:44 - should just look to save
46:47 - time I did this on a project where I was
46:51 - using react I'm pretty sure I was
46:53 - doing nearly the same thing I didn't
46:56 - have four tabs I think I just did it
46:58 - with two uh but I should check that
47:01 - before I try to redo what I what I've
47:04 - already
47:06 - done um that would be a waste of
47:12 - time so let me
47:15 - see and I think that one is um a private
47:19 - repo so if you won't be able to see that
47:23 - one if you wanted to follow along
47:26 - yeah it is
47:28 - private but this one that I'm working on
47:30 - now is public so um you can check that
47:34 - out if you want to uh links in the
47:39 - description all
47:44 - right all right so let me bring this
47:46 - over just so you can see you see what
47:49 - I'm seeing let me go over here
47:53 - um this might be a little small sorry
47:55 - about about that but there's a lot of
47:56 - stuff so I think we need it need to be
47:58 - able to see most of this okay so I'm
48:00 - bringing in
48:05 - h here we go so I actually have named I
48:09 - have quite quite a lot of things going
48:10 - on here so we have this
48:16 - container wow this kind of looks like a
48:18 - mess I don't know what I was thinking
48:20 - um
48:22 - probably I think I had a lot of this
48:24 - from an earlier project that I just
48:26 - copied and and uh so this is not all
48:29 - necessary but it was easy okay so I I do
48:33 - have the basic structure is pretty much
48:36 - the
48:37 - same although it looks
48:40 - like I've kind of messed with the the
48:43 - normal layout here and the the container
48:46 - for everything is a column instead of a
48:49 - row so I don't want to do that again
48:51 - what I really want to see though is how
48:54 - I've set up I to uh to work here so you
48:58 - see I do have two of
49:02 - these and it looks
49:05 - like I just kind of have the container
49:07 - inside what would this would be my
49:10 - row
49:11 - um
49:13 - normally yeah I don't know why I have
49:15 - this this stuff nested so deeply
49:19 - but I'm going to go to uh I'm going to
49:22 - have to go into
49:24 - the the J JavaScript because I did not
49:26 - put that in the
49:30 - component let's
49:34 - see all right let
49:37 - me let me see where am I at upload
49:45 - search okay I think this is
49:48 - it I'm going to take this off the screen
49:50 - I just want to double check and make
49:52 - sure there's nothing in this file that
49:53 - should not be public
50:00 - no I don't think there
50:14 - is all right
50:20 - so I might actually be using isotope and
50:24 - not Masonry which is not a huge deal uh
50:27 - cuz they're similar enough but it looks
50:29 - like I am using as the item selector the
50:31 - column and as the container I'm using
50:33 - isope container so I think if I just
50:37 - put you know basically the row here I'll
50:41 - I'll give the row a class and
50:45 - then as the item Ed column that should
50:49 - work yeah so let's do that and then
50:53 - that'll be that'll probably be the last
50:55 - last thing we could do so we can at
50:56 - least just see if this
50:58 - works and I don't know we'll see
51:05 - if okay Andrew ask can we get your uh
51:09 - GitHub user script theme so yeah my
51:13 - theme for GitHub
51:15 - is it's the GitHub dark
51:18 - script uh and I'm using um tamper monkey
51:22 - to run that so I it's not a Custom
51:26 - Custom script that I did so if you look
51:27 - up GitHub dark script I think there's
51:30 - instructions for how to use it in
51:31 - different browsers uh with different
51:33 - plugins so uh check that out uh it's
51:37 - really cool there's also lots of options
51:38 - you can customize it if you want I'm
51:40 - just using the base um you know the
51:44 - default options right now all right so
51:48 - let's
51:50 - do let's give these
51:54 - rows
51:58 - let's
52:02 - go let's make a masonry containers and
52:07 - then I think we should be good within
52:09 - that to say that the just the columns so
52:13 - want this to
52:15 - be masonry container and then this one
52:20 - is going to be the
52:22 - column okay let's see what happens when
52:25 - we do
52:29 - that let's let me try to
52:34 - refresh no I really need to fix just fix
52:38 - this this Dev server and figure out why
52:40 - it's not I've never had this happen on
52:42 - any other sites that I've used next to
52:44 - build this is the first time this has
52:46 - happened so I'm not not really sure
52:48 - what's going
52:50 - on okay oh okay so something's happened
52:54 - this isn't exactly what I want um so I'm
52:57 - going to have to work on it a
53:00 - bit you know I don't want this I
53:03 - obviously want this in four columns but
53:05 - we can
53:06 - see is it not working on
53:17 - there maybe it's just working on the
53:19 - first one all right so it's definitely
53:22 - it looks like
53:24 - it's it's doing something on the first
53:26 - one and we'll verify this by inspecting
53:29 - it and checking out yeah the positioning
53:33 - so we can see like it's being
53:36 - positioned here uh so that's it let's
53:39 - see if it's doing it on any other
53:49 - tabs it might not be I might have
53:53 - to H
53:57 - H yeah
54:01 - so oh yeah definitely need some
54:05 - work but at least we got it to
54:08 - initialize we just need to work on the
54:14 - um just some of the settings that we can
54:17 - use uh so basically I don't know if I'll
54:20 - do a part three to this I might just do
54:22 - it it looks like there's not like a ton
54:23 - of interest in this at least let me know
54:25 - if if I'm wrong here but uh just based
54:28 - on like the number of viewers we're
54:29 - getting it's a little bit lower than
54:31 - normal so I'm wondering I mean maybe
54:32 - it's just Monday and everybody's busy
54:34 - but um maybe there's just not a lot of
54:36 - interest in this topic so maybe there
54:38 - might not be a part three maybe I might
54:40 - just um I'll just get it working and
54:42 - then if you're interested you can check
54:43 - out the the uh repo and uh ask me
54:46 - questions if you want
54:48 - to uh but basically if you were going to
54:50 - do this if you want of the next steps
54:52 - The Next Step would simply be um
54:55 - to so first of all I'll probably need to
54:58 - add another
55:01 - um like a container element or something
55:04 - because these columns are getting messed
55:06 - up I need to keep these column classes
55:08 - or I need to somehow I need to set the
55:11 - columns correctly like like I can't have
55:14 - this column with here um I should never
55:17 - left that in uh so I need to set it so
55:21 - that it respects oh cool there we go so
55:24 - just fix that
55:25 - I guess I needed to respect the columns
55:28 - that we had that looks nice that's
55:30 - actually working
55:31 - so so that's that's fixed great so
55:34 - basically all you need to do now is just
55:36 - put some click uh handlers on each one
55:39 - of those tabs these these tabs here and
55:43 - then each time a click
55:46 - happens yeah see that's not that's not
55:49 - work see each time a click happens it
55:52 - would then um kind of re init refresh uh
55:57 - what's going on with
56:00 - um with masonry all right so we'll have
56:03 - to redo kind of like this thing for each
56:06 - one of these on click so worst case
56:09 - scenario it actually destroys the first
56:12 - instance of it and then reinit on this
56:15 - one and then gets destroyed so I don't
56:18 - know hopefully I can just do like a
56:20 - refresh but that's probably what needs
56:22 - to be done um off to check the docs
56:25 - again it's been a while since I looked
56:27 - at the docs for masonry but that's the
56:29 - process so that's what I'm going to try
56:31 - and uh that's what I'll work on probably
56:32 - tomorrow morning so let me check
56:37 - quickly and see if there's any questions
56:40 - here at the bottom and then I got to go
56:43 - um go to my meeting at 3:00 which is in
56:47 - 4
56:49 - minutes luckily the meeting is just
56:52 - like like 10 ft from my door
57:03 - uh Mark Twain asks have you ever used
57:06 - Google uh metadata in your project is
57:08 - that an improvement for SEO um I'm not
57:12 - sure Google
57:13 - met uh I probably won't be able to
57:16 - explain this I don't have enough time
57:17 - because I need to ask what you mean do
57:19 - you mean just like the normal metadata
57:21 - like title tag and um descript SEO
57:24 - description
57:25 - or like the actual meta tags I don't use
57:28 - like The
57:29 - Meta um like the keywords I don't use
57:33 - those at all I don't think they have any
57:35 - benefit to SEO anymore but title tags
57:38 - definitely uh have a big benefit
57:40 - descriptions don't really uh benefit
57:42 - your ranking but it's good for like
57:44 - actual humans when they read that um
57:48 - let's
57:53 - see
57:57 - yeah uh bromo MX says we should totally
57:59 - do it the react way yeah I definitely do
58:02 - want to do it the react way I'd really
58:03 - love to get it working like that um so
58:06 - probably I can do it like I think I can
58:08 - do it the react way with um with masonry
58:13 - uh I can like import it probably what I
58:16 - should do is like install it with npm
58:18 - and then import it into uh my component
58:22 - uh and then set things up like that so I
58:23 - think I could do it in a more react
58:25 - friendly way than I'm doing it right now
58:28 - but it's not
58:30 - like it's not terrible right now I think
58:32 - it's going to work uh we just
58:38 - don't okay Sebastian says it's kind of
58:41 - pointless to make another live stream
58:42 - just to add that onclick thing so um the
58:46 - git link for this project is in the
58:48 - description for this
58:53 - video
58:56 - romatic says can bring back the masonry
58:59 - component add filter prop to the
59:01 - internal State update filter value after
59:03 - clicking on the tabs and you could use
59:05 - something like string match inside the
59:06 - filter all right I'm definitely going to
59:09 - check that out and take a look at it I
59:11 - got to go to my meeting right now though
59:13 - uh thanks for
59:14 - watching and uh I'll be back tomorrow 2
59:22 - P.M

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse and uh happy Monday hope everybody had a good weekend uh at the end of last week I was working from home my streams were not not the same quality in terms of uh video quality so I could barely keep 720p I am back now in my office and uh so the quality in this stream should be a lot better today uh we're going to work on the masonry layout so at some point I think last week we uh we started working on this and we got to the point where it was working and it seemed like that was it uh I'll just have to do a few more things and and it would work but that's not that's not how it went so um I had some problems so I decided to do a part two to show those problems and hopefully fix them Today's show is going to be a little bit shorter than I have been doing so lately I've been doing really long uh shows because the the things we've been trying to get done have been a little bit more complicated and that's it's taking a while but I have a meeting at 3 uh 300 p.m. eastern time so in less than an hour so this definitely has to be less than an hour so I'll try to cut it off and start uh answering questions at at 230 and unless I can get this working sooner than that I don't I don't know maybe uh and then definitely be done you know before 3 so hey everybody we have some people in the live chat uh so how's it going hopefully the uh the lag time will be better too between when I say and do something and when when you all actually see it also have some upgrades um I got that new microphone hooked up on my work machine now so let me know if it doesn't sound good um I'm hoping that this is better sound quality than just the mic that comes with an iMac so if it's not I definitely want to know and and I can return the mic and maybe get a better one or just stick with what I had and oh the other big piece of exciting news that I have is I just upgraded my ram in this iMac so I have double the ram so that's always fun um I I've noticed it is slightly faster so we'll see the real test will be when I have a million tabs open and uh we'll see if it if it still holds up but let me um let me show you the problem that I'm having and where' it go sorry I just had it oh okay so let me show you the issue first I got to go in so we're on a branch so let me do a get checkout so if you're not familiar with Git You can make these branches which are basically like alternate versions of your um of your app or of your site and you can just switch between them so they're like they're like parallel universes in programming uh so if you you can try out some crazy thing on one branch and it doesn't matter if you totally mess it up because you switch back to your master branch and everything is is like it like it should be and you can use that to push um depending on how your deployment is you know that could be the the branch that's stable uh and you actually push out to your server so I'm going to switch to the masonry branch and now we should be able to see I'm going to bring up the site on I'm on my other screen right now bringing it up um what page resources okay so here we go here's the page right and look it looks like masonry is is working this is what we were left with you know last week after we got this going but when I click this tab you can see definitely not working and this is actually even worse than what it normally gives me usually I can at least get like this layout but the Footers back here but uh this time I couldn't even get that let me see yeah okay so here's what I normally get something like this so that's obviously not what we want and also I haven't tested the images yet I'm assuming that'll work it talks about it in documentation for um the react uh component that we use and this is the component in case you you weren't watching uh when we first started this I'm using react masonry component and um this is a react component that that uses the masonry uh Library if you're familiar with masonry or isotope it's used on a lot of sites uh to get you know this kind of kind of effect you know all these are just positioned uh with JavaScript you know and so each one as As you move the page around the position changes so you always have you know kind of nice even spacing between everything so the problem is really I need to refresh the layout somehow uh when the tab is clicked and I think I I ran into this issue on on a site I did before but I wasn't using the react plug uh the react component I was using just masonry um you know just the the JavaScript plugin by itself so I had access to you know to everything that you can do with that so there was a way to just kind of refresh things when you when you press the tab so that's kind of what I need to do at least what I think will fix this problem but I haven't been able to figure out how how to do it uh there's not really at least on on the documentation here I have not seen how to do that I did find something in the issues yeah they have these triggers so like on images loaded on layout complete on remove complete so I don't really need the trigger I will need images loaded at some point but I don't need the uh the trigger what I need is you know that that refresh so does that make sense all right I'm just I'm checking the live chat just for a second so I have uh more people in here now uh talking so oh okay uh Sebastian says there's some weird Statics on oh you know what I have forgot to turn my fan off let me turn the fan off and see if that helps uh it's a little bit warm in here today so hopefully that that helps it was a oscillating fan so I imagine when the fan was blowing right on the mic uh that probably made the noise oh okay saying so it's probably not the fan it was some other s okay let me definitely not the fan so all right so if it's still happening oh someone's saying it was the fan let me I'm going to do a little bit more at least with that mic and just see if it keeps happening uh if not if it's gets really bad let me know and then I'll just uh switch to the uh to the internal mic and um yeah I'm I'm not sure it wasn't a really expensive mic uh so I read some of the reviews uh on Amazon said that it was better than the internal mic so I thought I'd give it a shot and um we'll see maybe uh maybe I need to go with something a little bit more expensive a little better quality okay so what I'm going to do is um I'm going to go to these issues and trying to I should have um I think I still have the issue open on my laptop and I should have checked that out layout complete H that's not it's not exactly what I want to do um can't remember what the issues are I may be able to just look at what tabs are open on my laptop right now and just open it from there there we go so I'm just going to open the um the issues from my tabs all right nice that's a nice feature if you're using Chrome and you're logged in on multiple devices uh you can see what's open on all of them so uh I on my other screen I just opened some some of the issues that that had to do with at least some somewhat had to do with the issue that we're dealing with okay so this is what let me bring this over this is what I found that I think might help so and I couldn't get this to work uh maybe late last week I was working on it and basically you can bind this instance of masonry and then you can you should be able to do something like this you know this masonry on layout complete and you know do something so I couldn't get I couldn't get it to the point where I could bind it and actually access this it kept telling me you know like this you know doesn't exist so let me check let's go to our code and we're on the resources page let me make this a bit bigger for you all and I don't really need this right now and I don't need I don't need that side pen all right so P that'll give us more space okay so you see we have M these uh components now on just the first two tabs so the the tab that has everything and then the the tab that just has the audio cards uh you know we have masonry here we're going to try to add these we're going to try to add this on one of them just to see if we can get something get something going okay um then we should be able to call something like this so let's just let's just copy this I know this this isn't exactly what we want to do right now but this will be a good first step uh so I'm just going to go up here and put actually I already have component did Mount so I don't need to copy the whole thing okay so there's masonry on layout complete let's all right so I guess we'll do we we will put a layout complete Handler and let's just do something simple like um all right let's save that and hopefully hopefully we'll see that uh I was just wondering about with server side rendering maybe um no it shouldn't worry because well we'll see we'll test it uh there we go back here and I'm going to inspect this so we can see the console and first I want to click just to see if there's any difference now so you see whatever tab that's pretty odd now I'm have I have these things appearing H what did we do here that's really weird I'm going to refresh this because i' I've never had that I don't know why that's happening okay I'm going to check the live chat see if someone did I put okay uh so good uh so Patrick in the live chat mentioned I must have that in the in the jsx where do I have that should be oh you're right I I must have accidentally put that oh I know what I did um I pressed uh the the wrong key when I was trying to close this pain the um command slash like um I guess it be like the back slash I can't ever remember which one's forward slash and which one's back slash but one of them makes a comment and the other one toggles this pain on the side so I pressed the wrong one and didn't realize that I commented that okay so that fixes that uh not really our problem that we're trying to deal with but good catch on that Patrick thank you okay I did have a question about masonry is but it looks like it got answered um in the live chat so uh in case you are just joining um M and you have the same question masonry layout is I mean this this is what it is what it ends up looking like where you you can have uh content of different heights uh you can even have different widths if you wanted to um and then it all Lays out nicely with you see there's always uh the same space between them you know on all sides uh and it you know it keeps that space no matter what uh so you see as we do this our our width and height changes but it still it still works so that's basically a masonry layout so and then there's a JavaScript plugin called masonry that we're also using all right so what I'm not getting is any any logging from what we wanted here so we wanted this console log layout complete Handler this layout complete Handler okay so this should have it should have done something although now I don't remember when we do I just want to test this because I'm not sure with our server side rendering if I should even see this on the on the client side maybe if I um maybe if we do our client side routing and uh then we'll see that I'll give it a try either way so first I'll I'll do a hard refresh and this should give us the um the completely rendered h HML it's assuming my I'm going to just restart this so I still I know I've said this several times but I still haven't figured out what the issue is with why uh my Dev server just keeps like hanging um it's starting to get pretty annoying so I think I'll I'll figure it out okay so I did get let me bring this over here and show you that I did actually get that console log so so we can see that that actually did work so what should have happened is we should have got those three exclamation points that are in that are here layout complete Handler I'm just doublechecking that I spelled everything right yeah so this should have worked because our layout our layout should have been complete um I wonder if there's some issue with me using uh two instances of of masonry let's see let me um I'm going to switch it to this one just to check you know maybe see if we have any luck with the with the first one instead of the second one the um the hot module reloading does some weird things sometimes like that okay so I did get it this time so that we so we got these exclamation points this time uh so that's what we wanted I'm going to click click around here see if I can get him again scroll up oops wrong page we're on resources right there we go that's why I didn't get it okay so I did get it again so both when we do um I'm going to do a hard refresh double check that great so the client side routing we still get this so it it Bas so it works for some reason though it did not work when we had it on the second masonry element that's not good news so you need to be able to use this multiple times or else I have to rethink how this is laid out plan B could be if I need to if I can't get this to work with with multiple um instan of this masonry component on the same page then if I need to all of them could be within one masonry component and then we could do some sort of sorting some kind of sorting where I can pick um pick the categories and they all just all the cards are just shown in in head I don't know if masonry can do that right off the bat I'll have to check I know isotope which is a JavaScript plugin built by the same guy that built masonry isotope does do some cool things with sorting so I have to check that out isotope though is not free to use so may have to buy buy a um a license for that uh and then see if it works with this with this component uh I'm going to see thoughts actually uh bro bromo Matic uh says were you calling both of them this masonry actually no I was just using one at a time my next step was going to be okay do we need to call these different things um yeah I I guess that could be the next step let's see if we can yeah let's see if we can do something like that where we just give this a um I'm just going to put a two on the end I probably will not keep that keep that naming but uh for now we'll see if it works all right so let's see what we're going to get wow I don't know I really need to um figure out what is going on with my wow okay all right well I can at least see something I'm still getting this but I'm not getting um that second one and what force Reflow ask JavaScript all right so I haven't really seen this happen before so I'm guessing that whatever I just did here with this is not going to work out yeah I mean it's not like I did anything different all I did was just add this in a second time and then up here yeah I just added this there's nothing in here that I see that really should have caused this so um let me check one do another page just to verify that it's it's something on that page that's doing it actually maybe it's maybe I do need to restart the server um all right we'll try it one more time I don't really have at this point much hope that I can get both of them working so it may have to just think of some something else while I'm okay that should be up now Vlad asked Sublime Tex or adom which program better to use thanks uh I've never use Sublime so I can't really say I do I like Adam it is I've noticed Adam is slower than like Visual Studio code uh so I can't compare it to Sublime you know myself I've heard that sublime's a lot faster I mean I I like Adam I'm open to switching to something else though it's just hard to switch when you have all your packages set up the way you want them Okay it definitely is that page so let's take this out then we at all right since since the way that is given in the documentation to Target a specific component seems like at least at this point it only works if I put it on the first instance of this component then I think I'm this is a dead end that I'm trying to go down here um so we need to switch it and try something else okay so I'm just going to I'm G to kind of mess everything up here yeah so since this first instance is really all I need it'll it'll contain everything there are reasons that I wanted to split it out like this one of them being that um there's a limit by default on how many um how many posts you can get back when you make an API call to Wordpress which is what the uh all this content is where it's coming from so uh I thought it would just be a lot easier if at some point I could make separate calls for each one of these but there are other ways to get around that and I think that's an easier problem than trying to dig into this component and see see what I need to do so let's oops I forgot to take out the stuff at the top and something up here was messing this up so hopefully this will work now great okay so that works um now we have everything here of course these are not going to work anymore so what we need to do then is have some other way of switching these out uh which I think we can we can figure that out in where' I put that okay so let me search I know I saw somebody else pretty sure so somebody else how to filter select item just like example there we go I think that's the one we need it's SL slow all right H okay so it looks like there's not a builtin filter like with with isotope um all right so here's what I think we'll have to do then let me check this one as well was that one isotope Maybe so it looks like they do have a branch that works with isotope all right let me go back I'm going to check the live chat see if anyone has any ideas okay uh bromo mtic says maybe have one masonry component and clicking on the the all audio you know video buttons will change as the filter inside that one that one instance yeah I think that's that's probably what what needs to happen okay so let me look at I I want to see what the uh Json looks like here to see what I can what I can filter by I don't remember what I called everything so we're going to take a look at that okay I'll bring this over so you can see what I'm looking at um here's our here's the data that we're getting uh we're actually not getting this much I am narrowing it down a bit um you can see we're getting that up here uh so we're making this call here and we're actually just getting the title and then these custom fields that we set up um so in these custom Fields okay so I do have a field called type so this is what we need to check for okay so let's so I think I do want them all to show up at first so that this is going to stay the same this is going to be the first the first load uh what's going to happen then is when we click so let's add a click where's our tabs oh here there sorry I was looking at the wrong one this is what we want this is has all of them here's our tabs uh so let's see we'll put a click on click that's how it is in react right it's just it's on click I'm I'm checking the uh live chat just quickly Thor says no idea about frontend development especially not with react can't help sorry it's all right um uh Mark ask what is isotope okay so isotope is um just a a JavaScript uh plugin that sorts out you can sort out uh HTML elements um in like a grid so think like um like Pinterest like how it's all laid out in a grid like this uh so like this but isotope lets you like let's say I'd click on these and it would just sort them on the Fly uh so they would all you know come in and come out and Resort and everything uh really easily it can do other stuff too but that's mainly what I've used isotope for yeah actually Sebastian has a good point plan C I can just use masonry client side that's actually not that's not a terrible idea uh that's that might be a good idea I'm going to take a second to just think what would be the fastest way so I the the most to me the best way would be to me to figure out how to do this like the react way right uh with with within that context but a way to do it that would definitely work and it might it might make sense to just get this working right now uh and then work on the other stuff later on would be just to use masonry as on its own without being you know imported you know via this react masonry component um and then then I would have access to everything let's just do that because otherwise I don't think there's any way I'm going to get this to work right now since I well since I've never done it before and I've done the other way before so if I have any chance of getting this working today I doesn't have to be working today but I'd like for it to be working today then I'm going to go with Sebastian's suggestion so here's what we're going to do we're going to go to Masonry there we go we go to the Mason website and I'm going to just pull in everything from the CDN for now and because that'll be the fastest that way I don't have to download anything and we can just try it out and see if it works so I'm going to throw this it I guess it doesn't even really matter where I put this um just put it in here uh let me take out this react masonry component and let's take out where we've used masonry here and let's just make this a div and I don't even need this div actually let's just take it out okay so we don't need that div and column okay so we're going to S on the column um let's grab I think that's it I think that's all we need let's let's remove this I'm just trying to get rid of everything so we don't get any errors don't need that okay um so this is wow what did I do and I need to add these these other things in as well at some point um so we need to add back our categories because we're going to be able to use uh the the tabs like we were hopefully um we can get that to work so let me I'm just going to copy and paste on my other uh monitor I'm just going to copy and paste from the get repo what we have on the master Branch because that'll that's basically what we need I either could do that or I could just hold down you know command Z for like a minute and it would probably get us back to where we wanted but I'd still have to change out the uh masonry components okay Patrick said there was some audio static so it it for sure was not the fan which which is what we thought uh that it wasn't the fan anyway so I may be returning this microphone because I definitely don't need the static all right the microphone I really wanted was not the one that I got anyway so I don't know if I can justify buying the one that I really wanted but I think it's like a 100 bucks it's not like an insane amount of money but you know it's not really necessary I think everybody could hear me with the builtin mic all right so we have here's everything and oh man that was ugly uh they just copied in really really ugly looking so that's better okay so let's save that and just verify that this is working oh that's what was happening I left that on click and there U sorry I'm scrolling around really fast I hope I'm not making anybody like motion sick that would probably make me motion sick if I were watching I do I need to keep an eye on the time and not forget about that I should have set an alarm but I did not uh okay 242 I can go for maybe about 10 more minutes it doesn't look like there's really any um any questions as I'm kind of scrolling around or at least I did answer a few questions as we were going so uh so we may not even really have a a kind of question answer uh session at the end of this video like we normally do uh because it doesn't look like there's any questions if you do have questions uh throw them in there now uh into the live chat and then that way I know and I'll um I'll try to end early enough so that I could get to them and uh as always if you uh don't get your question in in the live chat if you're watching later or something then you can okay this is it this this looks bad but this is what it should look like uh then you can always put it in the comments on the video or you can uh message me on Twitter and I'll answer you uh whenever I get a chance so I do answer everybody all the comments and everything and any messages anybody sends me I do answer it sometimes it's a few days before I can get to it but uh I definitely try to answer uh every question all right so that's what we want it to look like right now so now since we've imported uh masonry here now let's initialize it I don't really want to initialize it with jQuery even though I could I'd rather just use uh van uh JavaScript cuz I'm not I guess I'm let me grab this element argument if you yeah this is what I need okay so we'll do it in component did Mount um let's call this and then make this actually do I need to say I probably need to do that right let me know if that's uh the case but I think I do need to do that um now we can paste this in here and and I can change these cons just to keep it consistent and the query selector is it's going to be row no yeah it will be it will be row because each one is going to be its own sorry I'm thinking out loud here um normally you would have you know one you know one encompassing element for everything but in this case we're going to have multiple so yeah it would be row actually I should just look to save time I did this on a project where I was using react I'm pretty sure I was doing nearly the same thing I didn't have four tabs I think I just did it with two uh but I should check that before I try to redo what I what I've already done um that would be a waste of time so let me see and I think that one is um a private repo so if you won't be able to see that one if you wanted to follow along yeah it is private but this one that I'm working on now is public so um you can check that out if you want to uh links in the description all right all right so let me bring this over just so you can see you see what I'm seeing let me go over here um this might be a little small sorry about about that but there's a lot of stuff so I think we need it need to be able to see most of this okay so I'm bringing in h here we go so I actually have named I have quite quite a lot of things going on here so we have this container wow this kind of looks like a mess I don't know what I was thinking um probably I think I had a lot of this from an earlier project that I just copied and and uh so this is not all necessary but it was easy okay so I I do have the basic structure is pretty much the same although it looks like I've kind of messed with the the normal layout here and the the container for everything is a column instead of a row so I don't want to do that again what I really want to see though is how I've set up I to uh to work here so you see I do have two of these and it looks like I just kind of have the container inside what would this would be my row um normally yeah I don't know why I have this this stuff nested so deeply but I'm going to go to uh I'm going to have to go into the the J JavaScript because I did not put that in the component let's see all right let me let me see where am I at upload search okay I think this is it I'm going to take this off the screen I just want to double check and make sure there's nothing in this file that should not be public no I don't think there is all right so I might actually be using isotope and not Masonry which is not a huge deal uh cuz they're similar enough but it looks like I am using as the item selector the column and as the container I'm using isope container so I think if I just put you know basically the row here I'll I'll give the row a class and then as the item Ed column that should work yeah so let's do that and then that'll be that'll probably be the last last thing we could do so we can at least just see if this works and I don't know we'll see if okay Andrew ask can we get your uh GitHub user script theme so yeah my theme for GitHub is it's the GitHub dark script uh and I'm using um tamper monkey to run that so I it's not a Custom Custom script that I did so if you look up GitHub dark script I think there's instructions for how to use it in different browsers uh with different plugins so uh check that out uh it's really cool there's also lots of options you can customize it if you want I'm just using the base um you know the default options right now all right so let's do let's give these rows let's go let's make a masonry containers and then I think we should be good within that to say that the just the columns so want this to be masonry container and then this one is going to be the column okay let's see what happens when we do that let's let me try to refresh no I really need to fix just fix this this Dev server and figure out why it's not I've never had this happen on any other sites that I've used next to build this is the first time this has happened so I'm not not really sure what's going on okay oh okay so something's happened this isn't exactly what I want um so I'm going to have to work on it a bit you know I don't want this I obviously want this in four columns but we can see is it not working on there maybe it's just working on the first one all right so it's definitely it looks like it's it's doing something on the first one and we'll verify this by inspecting it and checking out yeah the positioning so we can see like it's being positioned here uh so that's it let's see if it's doing it on any other tabs it might not be I might have to H H yeah so oh yeah definitely need some work but at least we got it to initialize we just need to work on the um just some of the settings that we can use uh so basically I don't know if I'll do a part three to this I might just do it it looks like there's not like a ton of interest in this at least let me know if if I'm wrong here but uh just based on like the number of viewers we're getting it's a little bit lower than normal so I'm wondering I mean maybe it's just Monday and everybody's busy but um maybe there's just not a lot of interest in this topic so maybe there might not be a part three maybe I might just um I'll just get it working and then if you're interested you can check out the the uh repo and uh ask me questions if you want to uh but basically if you were going to do this if you want of the next steps The Next Step would simply be um to so first of all I'll probably need to add another um like a container element or something because these columns are getting messed up I need to keep these column classes or I need to somehow I need to set the columns correctly like like I can't have this column with here um I should never left that in uh so I need to set it so that it respects oh cool there we go so just fix that I guess I needed to respect the columns that we had that looks nice that's actually working so so that's that's fixed great so basically all you need to do now is just put some click uh handlers on each one of those tabs these these tabs here and then each time a click happens yeah see that's not that's not work see each time a click happens it would then um kind of re init refresh uh what's going on with um with masonry all right so we'll have to redo kind of like this thing for each one of these on click so worst case scenario it actually destroys the first instance of it and then reinit on this one and then gets destroyed so I don't know hopefully I can just do like a refresh but that's probably what needs to be done um off to check the docs again it's been a while since I looked at the docs for masonry but that's the process so that's what I'm going to try and uh that's what I'll work on probably tomorrow morning so let me check quickly and see if there's any questions here at the bottom and then I got to go um go to my meeting at 300 which is in 4 minutes luckily the meeting is just like like 10 ft from my door uh Mark Twain asks have you ever used Google uh metadata in your project is that an improvement for SEO um I'm not sure Google met uh I probably won't be able to explain this I don't have enough time because I need to ask what you mean do you mean just like the normal metadata like title tag and um descript SEO description or like the actual meta tags I don't use like The Meta um like the keywords I don't use those at all I don't think they have any benefit to SEO anymore but title tags definitely uh have a big benefit descriptions don't really uh benefit your ranking but it's good for like actual humans when they read that um let's see yeah uh bromo MX says we should totally do it the react way yeah I definitely do want to do it the react way I'd really love to get it working like that um so probably I can do it like I think I can do it the react way with um with masonry uh I can like import it probably what I should do is like install it with npm and then import it into uh my component uh and then set things up like that so I think I could do it in a more react friendly way than I'm doing it right now but it's not like it's not terrible right now I think it's going to work uh we just don't okay Sebastian says it's kind of pointless to make another live stream just to add that onclick thing so um the git link for this project is in the description for this video romatic says can bring back the masonry component add filter prop to the internal State update filter value after clicking on the tabs and you could use something like string match inside the filter all right I'm definitely going to check that out and take a look at it I got to go to my meeting right now though uh thanks for watching and uh I'll be back tomorrow 2 P.M
