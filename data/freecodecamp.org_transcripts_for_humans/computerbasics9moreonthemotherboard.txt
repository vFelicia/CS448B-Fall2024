00:00 - hi today we're going to be talking a
00:02 - little bit more about the motherboard
00:04 - now the motherboard we mentioned briefly
00:06 - in the video about basic hardware but
00:08 - we're going to go into a little bit more
00:10 - detail today
00:11 - so what makes a motherboard is the
00:14 - connection between the cpu and the
00:16 - memory if there's no connection between
00:18 - the central processing unit and the
00:20 - memory we can't call it a motherboard
00:22 - but most motherboards do a lot more than
00:25 - that primarily they have expansion slots
00:28 - and ports
00:29 - now expansion slots are where you put
00:32 - anything that can increase the
00:33 - performance of the computer without
00:35 - putting more load on the cpu for example
00:39 - a graphics or a sound card would up your
00:42 - user experience by giving you better
00:44 - video or better sound quality but it
00:46 - wouldn't slow down anything that the cpu
00:48 - had to do
00:50 - a network interface card could also go
00:52 - in an expansion slot this would help
00:54 - your computer connect with the networks
00:56 - around it we'll talk about networks a
00:58 - little bit more in videos coming up now
01:01 - pc card which has really been turned
01:03 - mostly over to express cards are found
01:06 - primarily in laptops because of the size
01:09 - express card is better it's just much
01:12 - smaller
01:13 - in addition to expansion slots
01:15 - motherboards have ports now on your
01:18 - computer i'm sure you know there's a
01:19 - place where you can plug in a usb cord
01:22 - firewire sd card ethernet
01:25 - even an audio plug-in so you can listen
01:27 - through headphones now these are all
01:30 - considered ports a place on the
01:32 - motherboard where you can connect the
01:34 - cpu to some outside source either to get
01:37 - or give information
01:39 - so just a quick review the motherboard
01:41 - at its very minimum connects the cpu and
01:45 - the memory but it also has expansion
01:47 - slots and ports
