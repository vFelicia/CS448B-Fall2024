00:06 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:08 - with jesse i'm glad to be back it's been
00:11 - a while
00:13 - and uh
00:15 - today we're going to work on
00:18 - our react native browser editor which
00:21 - we started working on
00:23 - a while ago it's been like four or five
00:26 - months so
00:28 - uh
00:30 - just to
00:31 - give a give an intro to the show and the
00:34 - project since this
00:36 - it's been a long time and there's
00:37 - probably a lot of people that are new
00:40 - uh and this
00:42 - in this stream
00:44 - uh what i'm trying to do is work on a
00:46 - real project
00:47 - and i don't rehearse beforehand so
00:50 - there's going to be mistakes but that's
00:52 - the point is just to show you what it's
00:54 - really like to work on something to make
00:56 - mistakes and to
00:59 - to work through those mistakes
01:02 - so
01:04 - the format is
01:06 - i will do
01:07 - 25 minutes where i code and i don't
01:10 - really look at the live chat very much
01:13 - and then i'll take a five minute break
01:14 - i'll look at the live chat and i'll
01:17 - answer questions
01:18 - and i usually do like maybe two sessions
01:21 - like that
01:23 - then at the end i'll look at the live
01:25 - chat and try to answer as many questions
01:27 - as i can so if you have questions
01:30 - just be patient i'll get to them
01:32 - the recording of this live stream is
01:34 - available just a few minutes after the
01:36 - live stream ends
01:38 - so
01:39 - if you have a question but you can't
01:41 - wait for the answer then check out the
01:43 - recording and i'll probably
01:46 - uh answer your question at some point
01:48 - during the stream
01:50 - um
01:52 - feel free to ask ask questions uh if
01:55 - you're a beginner you know don't worry
01:58 - about
01:59 - you know asking questions about even
02:02 - just really basic stuff
02:04 - that's totally fine
02:07 - uh try to keep the live chat positive
02:10 - so um
02:12 - you know i will
02:14 - uh
02:15 - if there's any like
02:17 - harassment or negative stuff or anything
02:19 - like that i'll just block you from the
02:22 - chat so
02:24 - i think that's it
02:25 - in terms of introduction
02:27 - for the stream
02:30 - but
02:31 - in terms of the project what i'm trying
02:33 - to do is
02:35 - i want to get
02:38 - for this demo right we're just
02:42 - using create react app
02:44 - to
02:45 - make a
02:47 - a little proof of concepts
02:50 - so that we can
02:53 - edit
02:55 - react native code in a browser and have
02:58 - it display
03:00 - right there in the browser
03:03 - so very similar to what you would see on
03:06 - freecodecamp.org
03:08 - where
03:09 - you know you have like the split screen
03:11 - and you can type in
03:13 - html
03:15 - and
03:16 - javascript and then have the result
03:19 - appear
03:20 - that's what we want but we wanted to do
03:22 - we wanted to happen with react native
03:24 - code
03:30 - so i just happen to look over the stream
03:33 - someone says can you say the start and
03:34 - end timing uh the streams usually end up
03:37 - being like
03:38 - around an hour
03:41 - sometimes a little bit more than an hour
03:43 - so
03:46 - that's what i'm that's what i'm usually
03:48 - going for
03:50 - and i see a ton of people saying hi so
03:53 - hey everybody
03:54 - uh thanks for watching
03:58 - and
03:59 - i am gonna get started now so
04:03 - i'm gonna bring up a
04:05 - pomodoro timer on my other screen here
04:17 - and i wanted to get started by
04:21 - upgrading packages right so
04:24 - this is the the same project that we
04:26 - left off on months ago i've done nothing
04:29 - to it right so
04:31 - i want the stream to be as realistic as
04:33 - possible sometimes this happens
04:35 - you come back to an old project and
04:40 - i'm coming back to this project
04:42 - after a long time
04:44 - and i want to update the packages
04:48 - right for whatever reason it won't run
04:50 - so i did try to run it just a few
04:52 - minutes ago
04:54 - and
04:56 - i'm not even gonna mess with that error
04:58 - because i know that all my packages are
05:01 - at least
05:02 - you know a few months out of date
05:05 - uh so i'm gonna go through how to how to
05:07 - do an upgrade
05:10 - like like a mass upgrade here so
05:14 - i'm gonna do
05:15 - i'm using yarn
05:17 - uh instead of npm okay so
05:22 - that's just a um
05:24 - an alternative package manager
05:29 - for javascript packages for npm packages
05:32 - so we can do yarn upgrade
05:35 - and then
05:36 - i'm going to give it the flag latest
05:40 - actually let me do upgrade interactive
05:46 - latest i believe that's the
05:49 - that's the command let's see
05:53 - yep that's it all right so
05:58 - i'm going to make this bigger and
06:00 - hopefully the font's big enough i don't
06:02 - know that i could go much bigger and
06:04 - still display things on the screen so
06:11 - this is what happens when you type in
06:15 - when you do yarn upgrade interactive
06:18 - it gives you a little display here
06:21 - that um
06:22 - tells you what packages you're using
06:25 - that are out of date
06:28 - and
06:29 - how out of date it is right so it'll say
06:31 - like
06:35 - this is where you're at this is where
06:36 - you need to go right so
06:38 - and uh it gives you a little like color
06:40 - code right so red means there's been a
06:43 - major update and it's backward
06:45 - incompatible
06:46 - right so that means like there's
06:48 - breaking changes
06:50 - and it looks like all of the stuff it's
06:52 - showing me at the top here is red now
06:54 - there there is more right so as i scroll
06:56 - down it keeps showing me more so you can
06:59 - see
07:00 - a lot of our stuff is
07:03 - it's out of date wow
07:06 - we're almost all into the into the red
07:08 - here right
07:12 - wow
07:15 - i think it just keeps keeps scrolling
07:17 - through so we're not we don't have an
07:19 - endless list of packages it just keeps
07:21 - starting back at the beginning
07:22 - so um
07:26 - yeah see it just keeps scrolling
07:29 - but let's uh let's start somewhere
07:32 - and see
07:35 - what we actually want to update in
07:37 - reality i
07:38 - i really want to try to update
07:42 - everything and then see what happens
07:46 - okay
07:47 - since this is still like a work in
07:49 - progress
07:50 - i'm okay with breaking it right we we're
07:53 - using git so we can always just roll it
07:55 - right back
07:58 - so
08:01 - i can just run
08:03 - now that we've seen it
08:05 - instead of going through and
08:08 - like picking one by one
08:10 - uh what i want let's see better chances
08:16 - i think
08:17 - i'm gonna get out of this so i'm gonna
08:20 - ctrl c to get out of it
08:22 - and then let's go with
08:29 - i'm at
08:34 - let's go with yarn upgrade and i'm going
08:36 - to get rid of the interactive
08:43 - i'm just gonna do upgrade and then i'm
08:45 - gonna say
08:47 - latest
08:49 - and this should do all the upgrading
08:51 - without giving us an option of what to
08:53 - upgrade it's just going to upgrade
08:54 - everything to the latest okay so this is
08:57 - going to take
08:58 - probably a minute or two
09:00 - which is fine because it's going to give
09:01 - me a chance to check the live chat
09:05 - for a little bit
09:08 - now i kind of expect that things aren't
09:11 - going to work when we do this because
09:15 - there's so many breaking changes
09:17 - and that's okay i just
09:19 - now is the time to try to update
09:23 - you you don't want to keep your packages
09:25 - like so out of date all the time right
09:27 - ideally we would have been working on
09:29 - this
09:30 - um
09:30 - and this this whole time in the past
09:33 - four or five months
09:35 - and when a package went out of date we
09:37 - would have updated it okay but that
09:39 - didn't happen
09:41 - so
09:42 - we're gonna try this we're gonna see
09:43 - what errors we get
09:45 - and my plan is
09:48 - if we get
09:50 - if the errors are just so crazy
09:53 - that it's going to take forever
09:55 - then
09:56 - we will just
09:58 - start a new project
10:02 - and basically copy and paste what we
10:03 - need to over since we didn't get that
10:05 - far into this project right wow that was
10:09 - fast
10:14 - i expected that to take longer but that
10:16 - seemed to be kind of
10:18 - it worked well
10:20 - okay
10:21 - um in our package json should be updated
10:24 - so um
10:28 - let's let's check some of these
10:29 - dependencies like all right so our react
10:32 - dependency
10:35 - yeah wow that is
10:37 - is that
10:40 - the latest well
10:42 - okay
10:43 - all right so that did work so
10:45 - let's just try to run it
10:52 - if this actually runs i'm gonna be like
10:56 - really surprised
10:59 - all right so it didn't it didn't run
11:01 - okay
11:10 - um interesting
11:25 - all right well now we got an error we
11:27 - know at least somewhere to start
11:29 - um
11:32 - let's see
11:34 - just
11:39 - checking this out the live chat out just
11:41 - for a second
11:43 - okay
11:44 - um
11:46 - all right so let's check this out in our
11:48 - components
11:51 - workspace
11:55 - dot js
11:57 - i am using visual studio code
12:00 - uh as my my code editor
12:04 - workspace and
12:07 - movie ads workspace.js
12:14 - [Music]
12:23 - and we're getting an error on line
12:27 - 111
12:35 - oh okay so this is a
12:39 - let's see experimental hts configuration
12:48 - oh okay so this is just the config issue
12:50 - so um
12:57 - let's see if it tells us
12:59 - so the experimental decorators option
13:03 - do we have a config
13:17 - i don't think i have a config for my
13:19 - linter right now
13:31 - that was should be
13:35 - yeah babel should be handling this
13:49 - okay
13:58 - so
14:00 - what we've done in this project is we've
14:02 - pulled in a lot of code from another
14:05 - open source project
14:07 - and we're trying to adapt that
14:09 - so this is some of that code from that
14:11 - other project they're using in
14:13 - experimental syntax
14:16 - and so that's where we're getting
14:18 - this this error from uh so what i'm
14:21 - thinking now is
14:23 - at first i thought
14:24 - okay maybe this is just a linting error
14:27 - meaning like our
14:29 - linter linters check your code for
14:31 - errors
14:33 - um
14:35 - and if you're using experimental things
14:37 - you have to tell your linter that like
14:39 - hey i'm gonna use this experimental
14:41 - stuff i know it's gonna look like it's
14:43 - broken but it's not right
14:44 - but
14:46 - now i'm seeing like maybe
14:49 - tonight it's saying parsing error right
14:51 - maybe
14:52 - i'm not actually transpiling that so if
14:54 - you want to use an experimental feature
14:57 - in javascript you need to use a
14:59 - transpiler so you usually it's this this
15:02 - tool called babel and what babel does is
15:05 - it takes your
15:06 - your experimental code
15:09 - and
15:10 - it transforms it into normal javascript
15:13 - that a browser can handle so
15:16 - um
15:20 - if that's the issue then we need to make
15:23 - sure that babel can handle that
15:27 - uh so i do have something in babel
15:31 - for
15:32 - um
15:34 - for decorators right
15:36 - which
15:37 - that's what i i believe that's what we
15:39 - were
15:40 - using
15:42 - yeah
15:44 - uh but for whatever reason
15:47 - this is not working
15:50 - so
15:57 - see
16:00 - let's see
16:10 - let's look at
16:11 - i guess the first thing to look at would
16:13 - be
16:18 - the project i want to see how they set
16:21 - up babel for the uh for the project that
16:23 - i got this code from
16:25 - you might just be able to copy and paste
16:27 - from there and and this would work
16:29 - right so
16:33 - let's do that first
16:34 - so i'm gonna bring over a browser window
16:39 - actually you know i think i have i think
16:41 - i have the project open yep i do
16:48 - there we go let's bring this browser
16:49 - window
16:51 - over so this is the
16:54 - no that's not it
16:58 - i had
17:01 - too many projects open
17:19 - that's sweet
17:27 - okay okay so it's a search for it
17:49 - or i could just check the package jason
17:51 - are we bringing in
18:01 - there we go this is the
18:04 - that's the person that is just doing
18:07 - this so
18:09 - just search for this person on github
18:18 - there we go
18:20 - github knew what i wanted
18:23 - uh okay
18:27 - so let's check out
18:31 - pebble
18:36 - all right that's it that's the same so
18:39 - we got the same babel
18:41 - config
18:45 - make this all bigger
18:50 - team battle config
18:52 - and
18:59 - let's see
19:09 - all right something to chat is saying
19:14 - something to just use
19:17 - okay let's see let's try it let's try it
19:19 - out who is this so uh fred will let's
19:21 - try it out
19:37 - too soon if i use it like this
19:45 - your legacy linter options in your vs
19:47 - code settings they're no longer being
19:49 - used
20:00 - oh interesting
20:05 - yeah i don't want to remove them right
20:07 - now
20:08 - i don't want to deal with that right now
20:10 - okay
20:11 - um
20:16 - all right should we change that
20:20 - and
20:25 - let's do it
20:27 - and it looks like
20:34 - we get a new error is that it
20:38 - i believe we did
20:43 - all right cool so shout out to fred
20:48 - because that seemed to at least get us
20:51 - around like our
20:53 - our linter is still complaining but at
20:55 - least we got past the
20:58 - the air i was afraid that we would have
21:00 - had like similar usage in a lot of other
21:02 - places
21:04 - and
21:05 - it would have been
21:07 - a mess but i guess
21:09 - we don't so
21:12 - that's who we have uh workspace line
21:16 - which is
21:38 - do not use import syntax to configure
21:40 - webpack loaders
21:48 - all right
22:05 - let's check this out and
22:09 - also
22:13 - i think so it has been a while since
22:16 - we've imported this code so it's
22:18 - probably worth checking out this
22:19 - workspace.js file
22:21 - in the uh
22:23 - the repo that we just brought in
22:26 - yeah i mean
22:36 - let's see
22:38 - components workspace
22:41 - uh in case this has been updated since
22:45 - the last time
22:49 - yeah it does it does not look like it's
22:51 - been updated
22:53 - you can see
22:54 - it's june 5th 2017 right so
22:59 - definitely not not updated
23:04 - all right
23:05 - and
23:09 - [Music]
23:20 - my lost track of where i put my pomodoro
23:24 - timer that i had set
23:26 - there it is
23:27 - all right cool in about five or six
23:30 - minutes i'm gonna take a break and i'm
23:32 - gonna answer some questions so
23:35 - just hang in there
23:36 - if you got any questions in the chat
23:42 - all right so let's
23:44 - search for
23:46 - i believe i did copy and paste the
23:49 - the error yep
23:56 - oh cool it looks like it's just a linter
23:58 - thing
23:59 - so
24:30 - interesting
24:31 - okay
24:32 - so
24:33 - esl
24:34 - [Music]
24:39 - so i guess i could just
24:48 - disable that for a line how do i turn
24:51 - off
25:06 - all right so i'm going to stack overflow
25:08 - this seems to just be a linting thing
25:12 - and so
25:13 - i don't remember how to disable eslint
25:16 - for a line so
25:19 - yes i'm disabled
25:23 - oh cool
25:30 - swedes
25:32 - so we should just be able to eslint yes
25:36 - lent disable line and then put the name
25:38 - of what the rule that we want to disable
25:43 - so let's try that out
25:47 - oops
25:48 - there we go
26:01 - yes
26:16 - oops
26:25 - all right let's see if it is
26:27 - nice
26:29 - all right cool so that
26:31 - that actually did work
26:33 - so
26:34 - good to know you can disable a single
26:37 - line
26:38 - in eslint and just disable
26:42 - that particular rule
26:49 - import and body reorder the top all
26:52 - right that's that's easy
26:56 - so let's go to our index.js which
27:04 - it's kind of weird that i had that in
27:06 - there and it ever worked right
27:09 - all right i might just
27:13 - i might have to deal with this
27:15 - this issue because it keeps popping up
27:17 - and annoying me all right we're getting
27:20 - through we're getting through the errors
27:23 - um
27:26 - unexpected use of history
27:29 - no restricted
27:56 - that's weird
28:05 - i would not have thought that
28:08 - that would give
28:11 - i would give this error but
28:14 - i guess so
28:25 - all right let's see if we just can
28:27 - disable this line as well
28:32 - yes
28:34 - disable i already forget what the
28:38 - what i just typed in the other one was
28:41 - what am i looking for
28:45 - what was this eslint
28:47 - disable
28:50 - disable line
29:04 - here's a disabled line no
29:10 - restricted
29:19 - nice
29:32 - uh i took it to take us back to that
29:35 - uh looks like that
29:37 - the little switch that we put in here
29:40 - and is still not working so
29:42 - we're going to take a little break and
29:44 - i'm going to answer some questions and
29:45 - then when we come back we're going to
29:48 - go back to this
29:52 - decorators decorative legacy isn't
29:54 - currently enabled
29:57 - um
29:58 - we're going to look at this decorator
29:59 - issue
30:00 - all right so i'm going to scroll all the
30:03 - way up to the top and go down through
30:05 - and try to answer some questions
30:07 - as many as i can
30:12 - it looks like
30:15 - i may not have access to the questions
30:17 - at the top so there's been a lot of
30:18 - activity in the chat
30:22 - um so if you ask your question like
30:24 - super early like before the stream
30:26 - started i may not see it
30:30 - uh of course of course this is
30:34 - i'll get a question says can i get
30:37 - an eight-digit salary after doing this
30:40 - course
30:41 - probably not
30:44 - eight digits is pretty
30:46 - it's a lot
31:02 - let's see
31:17 - all right so uh oncon says um a very big
31:21 - um beginner and react js want to learn
31:23 - very enthusiastic about the course
31:26 - uh
31:27 - thanks hunca
31:28 - and i just want to clarify so this this
31:32 - live stream is not exactly a course
31:34 - right so
31:36 - this is um
31:41 - it's it's not meant to be a tutorial
31:43 - that where i'll take you through like
31:45 - from beginning to end and you'll learn
31:48 - concepts and things like that
31:50 - this is a look into
31:52 - um
31:53 - like a real project it's a lot of
31:55 - troubleshooting right like we like we
31:57 - have right now is
31:59 - you know we're trying something that you
32:01 - would normally have to do right like
32:03 - projects get out of date you have to
32:05 - update packages this is what happens
32:06 - when you update packages when you wait
32:08 - too long you try to update packages you
32:11 - get errors
32:12 - the errors are in code that i didn't
32:14 - write myself right which is this happens
32:18 - like really at you know you come into a
32:20 - project you inherit someone else's code
32:22 - right so the idea in the stream is to
32:24 - try to be
32:26 - as close as possible to a real developer
32:28 - experience right because
32:30 - um
32:32 - that way
32:33 - uh
32:35 - there are things that you learn from
32:37 - just doing
32:38 - that you wouldn't necessarily learn from
32:40 - a course and that's i think the value in
32:45 - this
32:46 - in this live stream is
32:49 - when things don't go right and there
32:50 - aren't instructions
32:53 - for how to fix it like what do you do so
32:56 - that's what we're doing here so it's
32:58 - it's not exactly a course but
33:00 - hopefully
33:02 - we'll all learn something as we
33:04 - as we could
33:19 - okay it looks like um there were some
33:22 - discussions and like some questions are
33:23 - getting answered like in the chat by
33:25 - other people so i'm going to kind of
33:27 - like scroll
33:29 - past that
33:35 - um abishak is asking about what's what's
33:37 - best
33:41 - software or ai so artificial
33:43 - intelligence
33:50 - and i'm assuming for for a degree so
33:52 - what's best for a degree software or
33:54 - artificial intelligence
33:56 - um i'm not really sure about that one
33:58 - i don't know enough about it to know
34:00 - what what a better degree would be
34:02 - um i mean i do know if like you don't
34:04 - need a degree
34:07 - to do software work
34:10 - but probably if you want to be on like
34:12 - the cutting edge of ai research like in
34:14 - a university
34:15 - they're probably going to want you to
34:17 - have a doctorate's degree
34:19 - i'm assuming i don't know for sure
34:24 - of course
34:26 - there are companies that are also on the
34:27 - cutting edge of ai research that
34:30 - you wouldn't maybe necessarily need to
34:32 - be a doctor have a doctorate degree
34:36 - to work on it
34:39 - saad says what programming language
34:41 - should i start with new to programming
34:43 - which should i start with
34:47 - really you can start with anything
34:50 - uh javascript is an easy one to start
34:53 - with because it can run
34:55 - in the browser
34:57 - uh so
35:00 - and and you can
35:03 - there's a lot of free resources for it
35:06 - it's a nice one to learn it can run
35:08 - client-side and server-side but
35:10 - realistically if you're just starting
35:11 - out just to learn the programming
35:13 - concepts you can start out with anything
35:16 - and you're going to learn the same the
35:18 - same concepts
35:21 - and then switch to
35:23 - you know whatever you you need to but
35:28 - if you want to go the route of like
35:30 - freecodecamp.org and with those lessons
35:32 - then the first programming language
35:34 - you'll learn will be uh javascript
35:37 - all right cool so my
35:39 - timer my five minute timer is up i'm
35:41 - going to start a new pomodoro session of
35:43 - 25 minutes
35:44 - and we're going to get back to the code
35:46 - i'll come back to the questions looks
35:48 - like there's a ton of questions which is
35:50 - awesome so
35:52 - but i'll come back to those questions
35:55 - after
35:57 - after this next coding session
36:00 - all right so
36:03 - i'm going to copy and paste
36:06 - this part
36:09 - so when i get errors like this oh you
36:11 - probably can't see
36:12 - let me
36:15 - you probably can't see the whole message
36:17 - here so um
36:20 - yeah my face is blocking out the entire
36:22 - message but
36:25 - basically when i get an error message uh
36:28 - i i want to try to copy and paste the
36:29 - part that doesn't have
36:32 - uh reference to my project in particular
36:36 - right because when i search for that
36:37 - nobody's gonna have that right so so the
36:40 - name of the file workspace.js i don't
36:42 - want that and i don't want the
36:44 - um
36:46 - like the
36:48 - location of the error in terms of the
36:51 - the line in my file right but
36:55 - if there's anything that seems generic
36:59 - that's what i want to copy and paste so
37:01 - we'll see in a second what i'm what i've
37:03 - decided to copy and paste so
37:06 - i'm going to leave this linting thing up
37:07 - so i can keep referencing it because i'm
37:09 - sure i'll um
37:10 - i'll forget the syntax again
37:12 - all right but i've what i've pasted is
37:15 - this
37:16 - decorators
37:20 - support for experimental syntax
37:21 - decorators legacy isn't currently
37:23 - enabled right
37:28 - and hey there's a whole
37:31 - medium article on it that's interesting
37:34 - i'm going to open the stack overflow as
37:36 - well because that's usually the most
37:38 - helpful but i'm interested to see
37:42 - what is there's an entire
37:45 - medium article
37:47 - that is titled the exact name of the
37:49 - error that we got
37:51 - so
37:54 - that's awesome
37:58 - i don't know that i've ever had that
37:59 - happen before
38:04 - so let's see what we need to do
38:07 - let's see how old this is first
38:09 - okay so it's from this year it's from
38:11 - may 4th so that's relatively new
38:18 - all right let's do this
38:20 - so
38:21 - let me make this bigger so you can kind
38:23 - of see this but
38:26 - this is great i can't believe
38:29 - whoever wrote it who wrote this
38:32 - patrick
38:33 - so shout out to patrick for
38:36 - writing a medium
38:38 - article
38:39 - all about this error
38:42 - all right so we're going to install this
38:45 - new battle plug-in
38:48 - and try to use that instead of the other
38:51 - battle plug-in
38:52 - that we had so
38:57 - it's possible since so much time has
38:59 - elapsed that the old battle plug-in it
39:02 - just isn't supported anymore maybe
39:04 - that's that's why
39:06 - we're having some issues so
39:09 - we're installing that
39:10 - and
39:15 - now let's
39:17 - bumble plug in
39:18 - i think we have a babble rc so that's
39:21 - let's use this one
39:36 - so there there are two different types
39:38 - of configuration files for for babel so
39:40 - that's why there's two different here so
39:41 - you can have a babble.config.js
39:43 - and the syntax is a little different
39:46 - for each one so or you can have a dot
39:48 - babel rc so i believe we have a dot
39:51 - babel rc
39:58 - yep and we do so in our plugins
40:02 - i i'm guessing i can just get rid of
40:05 - this this transform decorators legacy
40:10 - and
40:13 - all right it doesn't like the um
40:16 - the difference in
40:22 - and the quotation works so
40:30 - here we go what is this
40:32 - incorrect type expected
40:35 - oh it thinks i'm trying to use
40:37 - typescript
40:45 - all right and
40:46 - i believe it did say in that
40:48 - thing to restart
40:52 - so
40:58 - let's try it
41:07 - oh no we still getting the same error
41:09 - yep
41:11 - all right let's see
41:14 - so
41:19 - let me double check this
41:34 - shoot
41:40 - all right let's try
41:53 - let's try the stack overflow one
42:14 - looks like is there no
42:17 - all right so i don't think they actually
42:19 - selected an answer that worked
42:21 - but this one does have the most votes
42:24 - which this seems like the same thing
42:32 - the other thing i can think of is
42:35 - maybe
42:36 - since we use create react app it's not
42:38 - picking up this um
42:40 - babel
42:42 - rc file
42:46 - so let's check that out so um
42:49 - create react app
42:52 - is a great tool to start a react
42:55 - project
42:56 - but it does limit you a little bit
43:00 - in stuff like this um so
43:02 - in in
43:04 - like anything that has to do with a
43:06 - custom webpack
43:08 - uh
43:09 - configs which we're starting to get into
43:11 - like webpack
43:13 - uh stuff here so
43:15 - or at least related to webpack
43:18 - so let's go
43:19 - [Music]
43:20 - let's see
43:31 - so i'm just typing in um use
43:34 - dot babble rc with the cr with create
43:37 - react app
43:40 - so
43:45 - when i do um
43:48 - any search i usually try to say
43:51 - i just want stuff from the past year
43:54 - because i don't want out of date
43:58 - out of date stuff there we go using
44:00 - custom
44:11 - let's see what this is this is for a
44:12 - different project but
44:16 - you might have to use cut okay
44:21 - i wasn't sure if we'd have to use this
44:23 - or not but it looks like we might
44:31 - i might have to use customize create
44:32 - react app
44:34 - let me make sure i'm not already using
44:36 - it
44:37 - uh where's our package json
44:47 - yeah
44:48 - all right so
44:52 - let's do that
44:55 - this is actually this is gonna be fun
44:57 - okay so if you need to modify your um
45:04 - create react app
45:07 - um
45:09 - like your webpack config or your babel
45:11 - stuff for create react app there's a
45:13 - plugin you can use called customize
45:15 - create react app
45:19 - actually
45:21 - customize cra
45:23 - right so
45:26 - we're gonna go to their github page
45:32 - so that we can
45:34 - see what we need to add
45:36 - so it does use
45:38 - react app rewired
45:41 - okay which
45:43 - from what i understand react app rewired
45:45 - was like the first way that came out
45:46 - that you could do stuff like this
45:48 - um but it's
45:50 - now customized create react app is kind
45:53 - of
45:56 - sorry
45:57 - this like built on top of that
46:01 - so that's why we need both
46:04 - so let's do this
46:10 - so this potentially could cause problems
46:13 - with create react app projects so
46:17 - only use it if you really need to use it
46:20 - i've had success using it on projects
46:23 - it hasn't like messed up anything before
46:26 - so um
46:30 - but just be aware that
46:32 - you know it can
46:34 - throw things off
46:37 - all right so
46:38 - now that we have that
46:40 - in there let me
46:43 - let me double check to make sure there's
46:45 - we don't need to do anything else
46:47 - usage
46:49 - config overrides
47:04 - all right so we do need a config
47:07 - overrides
47:11 - file and actually
47:22 - oh it doesn't have it i was hoping it
47:24 - would have
47:27 - that would have something in there
47:37 - so
47:47 - sorry
47:48 - what's the name of this file config
47:51 - overrides.js
47:53 - there we go so let's make a config
47:56 - overrides.js file
48:04 - and
48:06 - so we're going to make this just in the
48:08 - root of our project
48:13 - config
48:14 - overrides.js
48:16 - and
48:17 - i'm going to copy and paste
48:28 - just to get us started
48:43 - there we go
48:44 - and
48:45 - a lot of this we don't need like really
48:50 - we i want to add this decorator's
48:53 - legacy
48:55 - and
48:57 - actually disabling eslint is probably
48:59 - not a bad idea since we're getting ldts
49:01 - and errors but this is just in webpack
49:04 - um
49:08 - that's cool whatever is
49:11 - i'll need that
49:13 - and
49:15 - i don't need this
49:20 - all right and
49:21 - so now
49:23 - we don't need these
49:31 - and
49:33 - all right let's see if that'll work i'm
49:35 - gonna manually restart this
49:51 - ah
49:53 - decorate his legacy
50:02 - it's still not working
50:09 - okay
50:26 - hmm
50:40 - i wonder why
50:47 - why are we getting this
50:57 - hmm
51:04 - alright so
51:05 - we have
51:22 - all right it looks like we have
51:24 - everything that
51:26 - we've seen
51:28 - hmm
51:43 - all right let's go back
51:53 - let's get rid of that one
51:56 - and this is about focus
52:01 - okay we haven't looked at this one yet
52:02 - this is just in general how you
52:05 - use
52:06 - babel plugins with create react app so
52:09 - probably not a bad idea to look over
52:10 - this just to make sure that we did it
52:12 - right
52:15 - all right
52:29 - we do we want to use our babble rc
52:32 - okay
52:38 - this might be
52:40 - this might be it
52:42 - so we don't
52:45 - we're not going to pull this in directly
52:52 - we wanted to use battle rc
53:03 - now
53:05 - now it should actually look at our
53:06 - battle rc file
53:28 - oh
53:29 - and i need to change
53:31 - change this
53:33 - all right i can't believe i forgot this
53:35 - okay so before create react app actually
53:38 - starts
53:39 - how did i not see this in the
53:41 - documentation like
53:46 - this is not in here
53:52 - that's kind of weird
53:55 - um
53:57 - okay anyway
54:03 - so
54:05 - uh let's check our
54:08 - package.json file here
54:11 - so
54:14 - we want to run instead of running
54:16 - when our when we run our scripts
54:19 - um
54:20 - instead of running it through react
54:22 - scripts we want to run it through react
54:24 - app rewired
54:30 - and that was that was probably our issue
54:32 - so stuff
54:34 - this may have actually worked before the
54:36 - way we had it and now it
54:39 - so now it will run through react app
54:41 - rewired so let's see
54:44 - on x force override
54:46 - bevel rc is not defined use valve or c
54:49 - is not defined
54:52 - yep
54:54 - you are correct
54:57 - he's battle rushing
55:08 - now it's going to use
55:11 - our new stuff
55:13 - all right we got a new error
55:16 - sweet
55:19 - so let's go back to our code
55:22 - our new error is
55:24 - plug-in preset files are not allowed to
55:27 - export objects only functions
55:34 - whoa
55:39 - this is actually a problem in our node
55:42 - modules
55:48 - that's wild
55:57 - that's pretty crazy because like
56:01 - this is it's a node much
56:04 - uh
56:06 - all right let's look this up
56:09 - and let's get rid of some windows while
56:11 - we're at it
56:18 - maybe
56:19 - are we using we're not using a new
56:22 - version of babble
56:35 - [Music]
56:43 - all right
56:52 - [Music]
56:56 - eight seven six five
56:59 - five
57:00 - you could probably uh
57:03 - what
57:05 - um
57:06 - i
57:07 - hear my kids in the background so that's
57:10 - it
57:11 - they're on their way to school
57:13 - uh there's a question here
57:16 - isn't react native browser just react.js
57:20 - no it's not so
57:21 - what we're trying to do is is say that
57:25 - you can
57:29 - type into a browser window like a
57:33 - like an editor an in browser editor
57:37 - react native code
57:39 - and then have that code actually run and
57:42 - display
57:45 - in the browser
57:46 - right in a little like window in the
57:48 - browser
57:50 - right so
57:51 - we need the code to be converted
57:54 - into
57:56 - something that the browser can
57:57 - understand
57:59 - like on the fly in the browser
58:02 - and so
58:06 - it's it's not um
58:11 - it's not running react native so that it
58:13 - can go in the browser right it's not
58:15 - just that it's it's actually
58:18 - trying to convert the react native code
58:20 - on the fly
58:21 - in the browser
58:23 - the the use case for this is
58:26 - being able to have online tutorials
58:29 - online react native tutorials
58:32 - where someone doesn't have to go through
58:34 - everything necessary to run react native
58:37 - on their local machine and they can just
58:39 - go into the browser
58:41 - and
58:43 - type it in
58:44 - and
58:48 - type in actual react native code and
58:50 - then see what the result would be
58:53 - right
58:58 - um so you're making a thing kind of
59:00 - compiler to javascript yeah basically
59:02 - yeah yeah it's it's like
59:05 - it's going to be like an in-browser
59:06 - compiler of react native to
59:10 - normal javascript
59:15 - okay
59:16 - sorry i got kind of off track from the
59:17 - coding but that was
59:20 - i think i needed to clarify that
59:23 - otherwise what we're doing is not going
59:24 - to make that much sense
59:28 - okay so
59:34 - it looks like
59:48 - babel preset es2015 okay so this is is
59:53 - um i believe related to like a new way
59:57 - that babel's doing its stuff so like you
59:59 - see that it says at sign babble
60:02 - right so this is the way we should be
60:04 - doing it
60:05 - and
60:07 - instead we're doing it this this older
60:09 - way
60:10 - so
60:12 - we need to
60:13 - switch things up so instead of
60:18 - [Music]
60:19 - like for instance a set of reactors
60:21 - should be at battle reactor you need to
60:22 - install uh
60:24 - preset react so
60:26 - that's what we need to do next
60:28 - right now my timer is up though
60:30 - so
60:31 - i'm going to answer some questions okay
60:34 - well you need to pull them out and
60:36 - what
60:37 - um
60:40 - you need to answer some questions and
60:42 - then
60:43 - on our next live stream this is where
60:45 - we'll go so actually
60:48 - if i have time i might try to sort this
60:50 - out before the next live stream
60:52 - um but otherwise
60:54 - then we'll kind of just pick up here
60:57 - with switching over our babel stuff
61:00 - to use the latest and it looks like the
61:02 - reason we didn't see this error before
61:04 - is because
61:06 - our create react app was just completely
61:08 - bypassing our babble rc so we had it in
61:11 - here
61:13 - but
61:13 - it this was never running
61:20 - which i mean that makes sense so
61:24 - anyway let me go to the chat and i'm
61:27 - gonna scroll up to where i left off at
61:29 - i'm gonna try to get as many questions
61:31 - as i can in
61:32 - um
61:33 - so
61:34 - i may not be able to get to all the
61:35 - questions since i do have to start my my
61:38 - normal job so i i'm a
61:40 - software engineer
61:41 - and um
61:44 - so if i don't get your question you can
61:46 - always put it in the comments to the
61:48 - video
61:49 - um and then i can try to answer it
61:52 - later on
61:57 - okay
62:17 - all right
62:18 - so
62:20 - we have a question what is react all
62:22 - right so react is a javascript library
62:26 - um for
62:29 - building apps
62:30 - and so it just it gives you this um
62:34 - it helps mostly with state management
62:37 - and
62:38 - it gives you an html like syntax
62:42 - called jsx that lets you
62:45 - kind of mix together
62:47 - html what looks like html with
62:50 - javascript
62:52 - and create
62:55 - create apps so that's
62:57 - super high level
63:00 - but basically like if you want to make
63:02 - web apps
63:03 - then react helps you do that
63:12 - okay
63:13 - uh dragon stone creation says the fan is
63:15 - noisy can you reduce speed i'm sorry
63:17 - about that you know what i'm right now
63:19 - i'm set up uh in my basement so i
63:22 - believe the uh the heater was running
63:25 - um so apologies for that
63:28 - i
63:30 - i have plans to put up some walls around
63:33 - my work area and uh like soundproof it
63:36 - but
63:38 - hasn't happened yet
63:39 - uh so i'm hoping i can get that done
63:42 - soon
63:44 - and um
63:45 - then the noise won't be an issue so i'm
63:47 - sure you can hear like the garage door
63:49 - shutting now and you could hear my kids
63:50 - coming down so
63:52 - uh not an ideal situation
63:55 - for live streaming but
63:57 - um
63:59 - if i waited for everything to be ideal
64:00 - then i probably would never live stream
64:09 - okay
64:11 - i got a question will you save the
64:12 - stream yeah the stream the stream does
64:14 - get recorded
64:16 - and it's available to watch uh on the
64:18 - free code camp channel
64:21 - and
64:28 - dragonstone creation says if so many
64:30 - packages are outdated in a short time
64:31 - when building a huge project uh won't it
64:34 - be a problem yeah it's definitely a
64:36 - problem uh so i
64:38 - actually yesterday at my my job i went
64:41 - through two of the the apps that were
64:44 - building
64:45 - and i i upgraded all of the packages
64:49 - and i do that pretty regularly because
64:52 - if you wait like we've done here in this
64:55 - project until
64:56 - you get so many things outdated you can
64:58 - see there's a lot of errors that we're
65:00 - working through
65:02 - so it's much easier to say like okay
65:05 - i'm gonna go through
65:07 - and you could just set a time for your
65:09 - project if you really want to like all
65:10 - right once a month i'm going to check or
65:13 - you know whatever amount of time you set
65:16 - you can say i'm going to check the
65:17 - projects
65:18 - if there are some packages that are like
65:20 - really
65:21 - like
65:22 - key packages that you're using you might
65:24 - want to just say every time there's a
65:25 - new release i'm going to read through
65:27 - the release notes see what what
65:30 - is happening
65:32 - if there were less packages we probably
65:34 - would have done that we probably would
65:36 - have read through the release notes on
65:38 - github and seen if there were any
65:40 - breaking changes and then tried to fix
65:42 - those
65:43 - according to the instructions
65:45 - uh that
65:46 - the the um
65:48 - package maintainers set
65:51 - so
65:52 - in this case there was just too much so
65:56 - i thought hey let's just go for it
65:58 - see what happens
66:00 - um
66:01 - also you know this this isn't
66:03 - like um
66:05 - a critical application or anything like
66:06 - that so we could afford to break it okay
66:09 - but yeah in a big app that's like
66:10 - actually in use you'd want to stay on
66:13 - top of this and not let your stuff get
66:14 - out of date
66:19 - um
66:20 - servant says are you coding with expo uh
66:23 - not for this particular project but i do
66:25 - code with expo pretty much every day i
66:28 - do i like expo uh if you're not sure
66:30 - what expo is it's uh
66:32 - it's a set of tools i guess that help
66:35 - you
66:36 - build with react native
66:38 - react native is a way to use react to
66:41 - build
66:43 - mobile apps primarily mobile apps you
66:45 - can build other stuff with it too but
66:47 - the
66:48 - number one use case is android and ios
67:14 - anderson uh silva says i'm a software
67:17 - engineer at google that's awesome
67:20 - i um i did interview with google
67:23 - uh this was probably a year ago and i
67:26 - made it all the way to like when you get
67:28 - on campus and do like uh
67:31 - you know i think it's like five
67:32 - interviews on campus in a day uh but i
67:35 - didn't make it past there so maybe one
67:37 - day i'll interview with him again we'll
67:38 - see but
67:40 - um that's cool
67:45 - i did actually i did a video about it
67:47 - too so if you wanna if anybody's
67:48 - interested in what it's like to
67:50 - interview at google you can check it out
67:52 - uh so i i think it's on the free code
67:54 - cam channel it's also on my channel so
67:56 - uh
67:58 - if you like this stream and want to see
67:59 - more stuff you can check out
68:01 - uh my youtube channel the links in the
68:04 - description
68:19 - uh fred mentioned my node version
68:21 - that i need node 10 plus
68:24 - so
68:27 - i think this is when we were dealing
68:28 - with that
68:29 - that first error that decorator error
68:31 - okay so uh
68:32 - i'm not exactly sure what node version
68:34 - i'm running
68:36 - on my machine right now but i don't know
68:38 - that that would matter
68:42 - would that matter
68:44 - for
68:48 - because i think because we're trying to
68:50 - use it client-side it wouldn't
68:53 - necessarily matter
68:55 - server-side it definitely would
69:20 - luisi's his eunuchs and diamonds are
69:23 - forever
69:26 - actually that's pretty much true eunuchs
69:27 - is everywhere
69:34 - uh cherry vanilla asks what language
69:36 - this is javascript
69:58 - says can we add babble rc to normal
70:00 - react projects
70:03 - oh well i wish i would have seen that
70:05 - earlier because um
70:09 - that that actually was part of our issue
70:11 - is that you can't just add a battle or c
70:13 - to normal recreate react app projects
70:16 - right you have to do
70:20 - customize create react ad so
70:23 - good catch on that one
70:30 - uh charbelle says how will the web
70:32 - editor compile code that's a great
70:34 - question and uh so actually we're using
70:36 - uh service workers
70:38 - so like the compile stuff happens here
70:41 - in our babelworker.js
70:45 - so
70:46 - it basically like
70:49 - we're taking what
70:50 - what happens
70:52 - like
70:54 - on your local machine
70:57 - when you
71:00 - so uh there is a
71:02 - there is a package called react native
71:04 - web which takes react native and
71:08 - converts it into
71:10 - um
71:12 - basically html css and javascript that a
71:15 - browser can use
71:17 - but it does that
71:18 - right locally on your machine
71:20 - so we're taking that
71:23 - and using it
71:24 - in a service worker
71:27 - so that it happens every time you type
71:30 - in
71:32 - something
71:33 - uh in your browser
71:35 - right so like it's it's really cool but
71:37 - that's basically that's how we get it to
71:39 - work is like in place of your local
71:41 - machine
71:42 - we have a service worker running
71:48 - okay
72:05 - uh anderson silva says why are you using
72:08 - a dark theme github
72:10 - uh i just i like dark theme
72:14 - so
72:15 - yeah i have the dark theme github
72:18 - theme so it's
72:19 - [Music]
72:20 - i'm just using a tamper monkey script
72:22 - it's if you look up github dark i think
72:25 - you'll um you'll see like
72:28 - instructions for how to do a github dark
72:30 - theme
72:32 - i just prefer it
72:34 - especially when i'm coding like i have
72:35 - the dark theme on my code editor and to
72:37 - switch to github like it's just this
72:39 - flash of bright
72:41 - uh it when you have the white background
72:43 - so it's better to have as for me at
72:45 - least i prefer to have as much stuff as
72:47 - i can on the
72:49 - dark mode
72:51 - easier on my eyes
72:58 - anderson silva says you don't like linux
73:01 - i like linux
73:08 - oh man and fred fred came through with
73:11 - the uh
73:12 - syntax to disable
73:14 - eslint disable next line so thank you
73:16 - for that i didn't see it in the comments
73:19 - but that would have been helpful
73:21 - um
73:22 - i need to get back in the hang of live
73:24 - streaming since it's been a while of
73:25 - like glancing back and forth at the
73:27 - comments um
73:30 - i'll get there
74:00 - uh looks like there's a lot of
74:02 - discussion about
74:04 - in the chat so i'm still i'm scrolling
74:06 - through looking for questions
74:14 - auggie says hello jesse i'm from
74:16 - indonesia i love to watch yuko's awesome
74:19 - thanks
74:21 - thanks for watching
74:23 - uh
74:25 - let's see you have a question wrote
74:28 - ronique not sure how to pronounce that
74:30 - for sure so apologies if i'm
74:31 - mispronouncing that but anyway it says
74:33 - which platform is easier to deploy from
74:36 - react native or expo i have two mobile
74:38 - apps i want to build i am familiar with
74:39 - react and i have created a simple react
74:42 - native app
74:44 - right unclear
74:46 - all right one clear which is better
74:48 - um i think expo
74:51 - makes it uh easier to deploy like in
74:54 - terms of actually deploying to the app
74:56 - store to deploy and update
74:58 - uh so i would check out expo
75:01 - in general when you're using react
75:03 - native i recommend always using expo
75:06 - unless you have some reason like
75:08 - something you need to do in your app
75:10 - that you can't do
75:11 - with expo and even then you could always
75:14 - start with it and then eject
75:17 - but
75:18 - there
75:19 - there are so many
75:20 - expo handles so much for you um
75:24 - that it just kind of makes it a
75:27 - nicer developer experience
75:29 - so definitely recommend
75:31 - using that for react native
75:35 - [Music]
75:47 - um
75:49 - that boss says do you have a telegram
75:51 - channel or group i don't think we have a
75:53 - telegram
75:54 - i'm not 100 sure like i definitely don't
75:57 - for the live stream
75:58 - i don't know if free code camp does does
76:00 - anybody know free code camp has a
76:02 - telegram
76:05 - it's possible that we do and i just
76:06 - don't know about it
76:10 - um
76:11 - if i want to be an effective full stack
76:13 - developer should i take a cyber security
76:15 - course to be an effective full stack
76:17 - developer
76:18 - uh i don't think it's necessary to take
76:20 - a cyber security course
76:22 - to be full stack
76:24 - um if that's with what you're into and
76:27 - you want to like
76:28 - specialize in that that's fine it
76:31 - definitely wouldn't hurt you but i
76:33 - wouldn't say it's necessary
76:54 - uh santo says can you please use
76:57 - dart mode for browser
77:01 - [Music]
77:03 - dark mode for browser
77:05 - i thought i was using dark mode in my
77:07 - browser i'm not sure santu could you
77:08 - elaborate on that question
77:17 - uh jamal asked would getting a
77:18 - certificate be better than getting a
77:20 - degree because i'm in college and a
77:21 - little lost because of it uh it it
77:24 - depends on what you want to do jamal
77:26 - really um
77:27 - if you want to do like
77:30 - web development
77:32 - then
77:33 - you probably you know don't need a
77:36 - degree you could get and you don't need
77:38 - a certificate either
77:40 - you just need a portfolio you need some
77:42 - experience
77:45 - uh but different different aspects of
77:48 - like coding it it
77:50 - it just depends so like
77:53 - it depends on where you're at
77:55 - what country you're in
77:58 - certain
77:59 - certain places or certain industries
78:01 - still prefer a degree
78:03 - um
78:04 - so you would definitely need to i would
78:06 - need more information let's say to be
78:08 - able to tell for sure right like can you
78:11 - get a good job without a
78:13 - without a degree yeah definitely in
78:17 - in uh some in some type of coding
78:22 - um
78:24 - but if there's something you really
78:25 - specifically want to do then
78:28 - it may be more helpful to get a degree
78:31 - maybe not
79:07 - uh thomas says do you all understand
79:09 - what he's coding i'm new to coding and i
79:11 - have no clue uh thomas don't worry about
79:13 - it like feel free to ask any questions
79:16 - we did just we like we just jumped into
79:18 - this project so
79:20 - um
79:21 - it's it's definitely okay to be a little
79:23 - bit confused like in reality like
79:27 - this is
79:30 - like i'm a little bit lost right we're
79:33 - trying to work through bugs and
79:34 - everything
79:35 - uh so that's
79:37 - uh
79:38 - totally
79:39 - understandable um to be a little lost
79:42 - all right we're just like jumping right
79:44 - back into
79:45 - a project
79:47 - that
79:48 - we haven't some of you have not seen it
79:50 - all before i haven't looked at it in
79:52 - four months so
79:54 - um
79:55 - that's a that's a legitimate
79:57 - uh feeling to have
80:37 - uh
80:38 - let's see
80:40 - just trying to scroll through and find
80:41 - actual questions there's a lot of a lot
80:43 - of comments and stuff
80:59 - uh thomas says uh not a question but
81:02 - just wanted to say thanks for teaching
81:03 - me a lot of concepts that i know now uh
81:06 - your videos have been very helpful thank
81:08 - you i appreciate that
81:14 - um
81:16 - lupendra says is there any relation or
81:19 - similarity between react js and react
81:21 - native uh yeah definitely so
81:23 - um
81:27 - a lot of the concepts are the same um so
81:30 - like the way you handle state
81:32 - uh is the same in react.js and react
81:35 - native uh like the structure of the the
81:39 - jsx syntax is the same uh so uh honestly
81:43 - they're
81:45 - react native and react in terms of how
81:49 - you develop things like from the
81:50 - developer perspective
81:53 - uh of trying to build something with
81:55 - them
81:57 - are very very similar
82:00 - so um
82:01 - you know you're just you're using
82:03 - components
82:04 - to build apps
82:07 - the differences
82:10 - are mainly in
82:12 - what components you can use right so in
82:15 - react you can use what we call like dom
82:18 - primitives so divs spans
82:21 - p tags h h tag stuff like that
82:25 - you can't use that in react native
82:27 - so that's that's probably the biggest
82:29 - difference
82:30 - when you're developing right so there
82:32 - are other tags that come with react
82:35 - native that you would use in in that
82:37 - place but like
82:39 - if whether you start with react native
82:41 - or if you start with react switching
82:43 - from one to the other
82:44 - is
82:45 - not very difficult
83:10 - uh gavin says have you used ionic with
83:13 - react what do you think of it i've never
83:15 - used ionic with react
83:17 - i did use i've used ionic but this was
83:20 - probably like i don't know six years ago
83:23 - i used ionic so i thought it was really
83:26 - cool
83:27 - when i did use it
83:28 - um
83:30 - i probably wouldn't use it now uh ionic
83:32 - is a way to build um
83:36 - mobile apps with javascript
83:38 - so i probably wouldn't use it ionic with
83:41 - react if i wanted to build
83:44 - a mobile app
83:45 - using react i would just use react
83:47 - native
83:50 - so
83:51 - i don't know unless there's some
83:54 - benefit to using ionic with react that i
83:56 - don't know about that's which way i
83:58 - would go
84:01 - if i if i wanted to use java some other
84:05 - javascript framework
84:06 - to build a
84:08 - an app then i probably would go with
84:10 - ionic
84:21 - all right i'm getting down towards the
84:23 - end of the chat
84:26 - so
84:33 - let's see i'm trying to find the
84:35 - questions here
84:36 - okay here's one um
84:39 - why most of programmers are arrogant
84:42 - i don't know
84:45 - i don't know are programmers arrogant um
84:49 - maybe
84:51 - i don't i don't really know
84:55 - maybe that's a psychology question
84:57 - that's not my my area so i hope i don't
85:00 - come off as arrogant
85:02 - if i do i apologize
85:11 - uh there's some uh i saw a few questions
85:13 - about people saying i just joined the
85:15 - stream what are we doing um
85:17 - check out
85:18 - the uh recording
85:20 - and
85:21 - you know go back to the beginning and
85:23 - then uh you'll get a good explanation of
85:24 - what's what's happening
85:34 - uh the i.t thinker says where are you
85:36 - reading the questions from i'm just
85:38 - reading them from the chat so i'm just
85:40 - scrolling down through the chat log and
85:42 - uh and reading the questions
85:46 - decoder says hey i cannot find any of
85:48 - these questions in this chat
85:50 - um
85:52 - yeah maybe it was because i was way back
85:54 - at the beginning of the jet
86:04 - okay
86:05 - is it possible to convert angular to
86:08 - react developer
86:10 - okay so you mean like you
86:12 - you're an angular developer and you want
86:14 - to become a react developer yeah i mean
86:16 - that's definitely possible
86:20 - if the question is is it possible to
86:21 - convert an angular app to a react app
86:24 - then that that would be pretty difficult
86:27 - you would have to like basically rewrite
86:29 - it
86:34 - okay and now the question is which is
86:35 - better angular or react
86:37 - um
86:40 - that it just entirely depends it depends
86:43 - on what you're trying to build um
86:46 - what your team is good with or what
86:48 - you're good with already
86:51 - so that's
86:53 - that's a tough question to answer
86:54 - without any other
86:59 - any other information
87:18 - let's see
87:28 - uh abby scheck says i'm not able to run
87:30 - c plus in windows 10 what should i do
87:34 - i don't i don't have any experience with
87:36 - trying to run c plus in windows 10 so i
87:39 - unfortunately i can't answer your
87:41 - question
87:45 - yeah
87:46 - i don't
87:47 - i don't know the last time i did
87:48 - anything with c plus plus i was in
87:53 - probably in
87:55 - 2009
87:59 - yeah
88:00 - try 2 000 and no it was before that it
88:03 - was probably 2005.
88:06 - so it's been quite a while since i've
88:07 - done anything with c plus plus so
88:09 - uh
88:11 - sorry i can't
88:13 - can't help with that
88:15 - um
88:16 - how many days to learn react oh i i
88:19 - don't know it depends on
88:21 - how much you already know um
88:24 - how many hours per day you can
88:28 - you can dedicate to it
88:36 - uh jaeger says why is common.js and
88:39 - import syntax in that file like both of
88:42 - them
88:43 - to take truth i'm not entirely sure why
88:45 - they're both in there
88:47 - i don't remember if i did that or if
88:48 - that was some code i copied and pasted
88:50 - in
88:52 - i don't know
88:57 - uh
88:58 - truong says uh could you teach us soft
89:01 - skills
89:02 - um
89:05 - i don't know about in the stream
89:07 - uh
89:11 - but i guess um
89:13 - i could talk about soft skills maybe not
89:16 - maybe that would be like better for a
89:18 - video like on my channel
89:20 - i do more like um
89:23 - recorded video tutorials maybe that
89:25 - would be good
89:27 - but it's hard to teach like i could talk
89:29 - about it but teaching it would probably
89:30 - take like a lot of actual like practice
89:33 - and experience and stuff
89:44 - uh carlos says i just want to say thank
89:45 - you for sharing your time and knowledge
89:47 - keep up the good work oh thanks i
89:48 - appreciate it and thanks for watching um
89:52 - abhishek says can you assure can can you
89:54 - talk about the stability of a job
89:56 - without a degree
89:58 - um
90:00 - yeah honestly i
90:03 - here's the way i feel about job
90:04 - stability
90:06 - with or without a degree
90:08 - it seems like
90:12 - at least so i'm coming from the united
90:14 - states um i live near pittsburgh in the
90:17 - united states so it may not
90:19 - it's it's probably different in other
90:21 - places but it seems to me like
90:24 - like i personally don't count on
90:27 - stability uh in my job so um i
90:31 - i'm always trying to be ready like
90:34 - try to keep my res
90:36 - my resume my linkedin updated try to
90:38 - keep my skills updated and
90:42 - because
90:46 - i don't count on always being able to
90:48 - work at the same place that i'm working
90:51 - uh so
90:52 - you have companies like if you're at a
90:54 - small company small companies got a
90:56 - business or get bought out like
90:59 - all the time right so
91:03 - you're probably not going to have much
91:04 - job stability if you're at a startup or
91:07 - a small company but even large companies
91:10 - they they change things they restructure
91:13 - they you know they fire employees
91:16 - things change so frequently
91:19 - that
91:21 - i just
91:22 - think it's better to assume that no
91:24 - matter what
91:26 - you're probably not going to have much
91:28 - job stability right so
91:31 - my assumption for myself is that i'll
91:34 - probably change jobs every few years
91:37 - um
91:39 - and so i just try to keep myself
91:41 - prepared for that
91:43 - so
91:44 - just making sure that i keep track of
91:46 - like what is the most in demand
91:48 - uh what are the most in demand skills
91:50 - right now
91:52 - what should i be learning
91:54 - like trying to go to conferences and
91:57 - um
91:58 - talk to people like in terms of
92:00 - networking and stuff so
92:04 - that's how i i feel i don't i don't know
92:07 - that having a degree
92:09 - would it like in the software
92:12 - engineering field i don't know that
92:13 - having a degree would make you
92:16 - have more or less job stability
92:19 - in other fields like in general just in
92:21 - life
92:22 - having a degree probably would help you
92:24 - to get more jobs because there's still a
92:25 - lot of jobs out there that
92:27 - they just want a degree no matter what
92:28 - even if it doesn't make sense for you to
92:30 - have a degree
92:32 - but if you want to stick with software
92:34 - engineering
92:36 - once you get to the point where you have
92:37 - some job experience the degree really
92:40 - doesn't matter that much for most
92:42 - software engineering jobs
92:49 - hopefully that answered your question
92:54 - um
92:55 - donae says what is best between an
92:57 - android app or a single page app
93:01 - um
93:02 - that
93:03 - that really kind of depends like um
93:06 - on what what you're trying to do
93:08 - uh a single page app would run in the
93:10 - browser
93:12 - um
93:12 - obviously so like an android app is
93:14 - gonna be a mobile app for the phone so
93:17 - it
93:17 - it's i don't know that it's a question
93:19 - of what's the best in general it would
93:21 - be like
93:23 - what what is the goal like what's the
93:25 - what is the app which is supposed to be
93:26 - doing what's the goal
93:32 - um
93:34 - visager says what's the best place for
93:36 - finding a job online for angular or
93:38 - react um
93:41 - this is the places that i like to go for
93:43 - finding a job online so uh
93:46 - believe it or not twitter is a good
93:48 - place if you like let people know on
93:51 - twitter that you're looking
93:53 - i've had a lot of
93:55 - a lot of
93:57 - good luck with uh
94:00 - people contacting me about jobs on
94:02 - twitter
94:03 - uh linkedin
94:05 - uh there's a
94:08 - place what is it called zip recruiter
94:12 - zip recruiter um
94:15 - i like it because
94:17 - they show a lot of like salary
94:19 - information which is good to know
94:23 - like up front
94:25 - and then
94:27 - stack overflow has a job site
94:30 - so those are probably the places that
94:32 - i would recommend
94:34 - uh looking
94:35 - it but that's coming from somebody in
94:37 - the united states if you're in different
94:39 - parts of the world i don't know how
94:40 - helpful those places are there might be
94:43 - other websites that are better
94:45 - but that's where i would
94:46 - i would check
94:50 - uh amir says react native or flutter
94:53 - uh i haven't used flutter so i don't
94:55 - really think i could give a good
94:56 - comparison i do really like react native
95:00 - i've heard good things about flutter but
95:02 - like i just
95:04 - i don't know enough about it i think to
95:06 - really do a good job of of talking about
95:09 - why you would want to use it or not use
95:11 - it compared to react native
95:16 - jmo vlogs says what's your favorite
95:19 - coding language
95:20 - i like javascript i mean it's
95:24 - it's what i code with most often not
95:27 - that i don't like other languages but if
95:29 - i had to pick a favorite i'd probably
95:30 - say job is good
95:35 - um
95:37 - or do novels says can can we watch a
95:39 - recorded version of the session yep the
95:41 - recording will be available
95:42 - probably just a few minutes after i end
95:44 - this one
95:57 - let's see
96:08 - um all right abby scheck says who gets
96:12 - more salary a person with or without a
96:14 - degree
96:15 - and this is from india so i to be honest
96:18 - with you i don't know very much at all
96:19 - about the job market in india so i don't
96:21 - know that i can answer that question
96:25 - so
96:27 - uh if there's anybody from india that
96:29 - has any experience with that please you
96:31 - know maybe uh throw an answer out here
96:33 - or if you're watching the recording
96:35 - maybe later on
96:36 - in the uh
96:40 - in the comments
96:46 - um pat
96:47 - patsell says uh great job how can i how
96:50 - can i become a good programmer can i do
96:52 - that by reading people's code
96:54 - yeah reading other people's code
96:56 - definitely helps give you more ideas
96:58 - about how to do things
96:59 - but i would say more than just reading
97:01 - it is like actually working with it so
97:03 - like if you see an open source project
97:06 - like
97:07 - i think it's even more helpful instead
97:09 - of just reading it try to actually
97:11 - contribute to it
97:13 - then you really start to understand it
97:15 - like how it works
97:16 - and i think that will help you to become
97:19 - a better programmer
97:20 - because you'll
97:22 - hopefully pick up on all the good ideas
97:24 - that other programmers are having and
97:26 - like start incorporating that into your
97:28 - project
97:30 - i know like i i worked on an open source
97:33 - project recently
97:35 - i did some streams on it on my youtube
97:37 - channel it was the react native async
97:40 - storage package
97:41 - and that package was using typescript
97:44 - and so i had to learn typescript to
97:45 - contribute and now i've incorporated
97:47 - typescript into
97:49 - my other projects so it's like i kind of
97:52 - absorbed some of that
97:54 - and and just
97:56 - you know it's made my code better by
97:59 - contributing uh to this other project
98:05 - uh let's see
98:07 - i gotta make sure i keep track of time
98:08 - so i can work all right so we'll do a
98:11 - few more questions uh before i wrap this
98:13 - up
98:14 - um let's see he had a job as a junior
98:17 - dev for eight months and left on good
98:19 - terms i know front end with ujs would
98:22 - you learn back end to go full stack or
98:24 - just look for another front-end position
98:26 - um
98:28 - honestly like if i needed to find a job
98:30 - i needed money i would just look for a
98:32 - front-end position and like try to learn
98:35 - as i go uh if
98:37 - like i really wanted to go full stack
98:39 - and i didn't need a job right away then
98:41 - yeah maybe learn
98:42 - learn back end but so it kind of depends
98:44 - on your situation
98:49 - um can you talk about coding bootcamp
98:52 - thank you i have never done a coding
98:53 - bootcamp so i don't know that much about
98:55 - it my wife did do a coding boot camp and
98:58 - she loved it and she got a job right
99:00 - away
99:01 - um so she did the flat iron school
99:04 - boot camp
99:05 - so
99:06 - i think boot camps can be really helpful
99:09 - but you got to make sure you're going to
99:10 - a good boot camp so do your research
99:12 - first
99:14 - and probably like
99:17 - see you
99:19 - check out where the people are working
99:22 - that have gone through that boot camp
99:24 - right because that's the proof of
99:25 - whether or not the boot camp is gonna
99:27 - get you ready for a job like have people
99:29 - already gone through this boot camp and
99:30 - gotten jobs
99:32 - uh and don't just look at what the boot
99:34 - camp says like
99:36 - look at their
99:37 - people who've actually gone to the boot
99:38 - camp you know and like maybe try to
99:41 - reach out to him on twitter or something
99:43 - and say like hey you did this boot camp
99:45 - like what did you think of it
99:57 - um jmovlog says where's the best place
100:00 - to find conferences talks networking
100:02 - opportunities
100:03 - um
100:04 - let's see
100:08 - you can uh so this might be a weird way
100:10 - to look for conferences but if you go to
100:12 - papercall.io
100:16 - you can search for uh conferences and
100:18 - events and you can search by keyword so
100:20 - you could type in like javascript to
100:21 - react and you could find a bunch of
100:24 - conferences and events
100:25 - um
100:28 - uh there i think it's just tech
100:29 - conferences that they have on there
100:31 - so that might not be a bad way to to
100:33 - check it out
100:42 - andre says
100:44 - i'm assuming this is the question is do
100:46 - i really need to use redux in all react
100:47 - projects you definitely don't need redux
100:50 - in
100:50 - all your react projects
100:52 - so i
100:54 - i rarely use redux in my react projects
100:56 - i only use redux if it gets to the point
100:58 - where it's really the state management
101:00 - starts to get very complex and i feel
101:02 - like it could be helpful to use redux
101:11 - let's see
101:13 - xeno says for half hour i just listened
101:15 - and watched slot of nothing
101:17 - um yeah the at the end of the uh stream
101:20 - we just do question and answer so
101:23 - um
101:26 - yeah so if the coding is the first part
101:29 - of the stream second part is question
101:30 - and answer
101:41 - uh cyberworld asked to when do you start
101:42 - your coding coding is the first so like
101:44 - we're done with the coding at this point
101:46 - so
101:47 - um
101:53 - uh mulik says can you tell me the
101:56 - learning curve to be a front end dev for
101:58 - example html css js likewise yeah i
102:01 - don't know
102:03 - i don't know exactly how to
102:04 - explain the learning curve i guess but
102:06 - yeah like that's that's the way you'd
102:08 - want to go right like if you want to be
102:09 - a front-end developer start with html
102:11 - css javascript then uh maybe check out
102:15 - some sort of framework
102:17 - um
102:18 - like once you learn html css and
102:20 - javascript i would like start building
102:21 - stuff
102:24 - don't wait to actually build stuff
102:27 - and
102:28 - then
102:29 - then you'll start to get a feel for like
102:31 - oh you know i'm doing this
102:33 - this thing over and over again maybe
102:34 - there's some library that does it for me
102:36 - right that's kind of like
102:38 - um
102:40 - i think you kind of naturally
102:42 - need
102:43 - to branch out
102:45 - or want to branch out and learn other
102:47 - libraries and things
103:02 - okay
103:07 - yeah zeno um
103:09 - so i'm yeah i'm not going to code
103:11 - anymore for this stream so like for the
103:13 - first hour we code and then after that
103:16 - we uh
103:17 - do question and answer
103:21 - all right all right last question and
103:24 - then we'll be done it says why react and
103:26 - not view
103:27 - um
103:28 - i i work with react i know react
103:31 - i don't know of you i mean that's really
103:33 - it like i
103:35 - so
103:36 - i work with react at my job
103:38 - and i've been working with react for a
103:40 - while so
103:42 - um that's what i'm good with so that's
103:44 - what i'm gonna work with um
103:46 - if you use a good framework as well i
103:48 - haven't done anything with it but i've
103:49 - heard good things about it
103:51 - so
103:53 - but yeah that's why we're doing we don't
103:55 - react stuff you wouldn't want to watch
103:56 - me do a view stream because i'm no good
103:58 - with you i don't know anything about it
104:01 - all right so anyway thank you so much
104:02 - for watching
104:04 - i'm going to try to stream more
104:05 - regularly um now and get back into it
104:08 - and um
104:12 - yeah so i'm trying to put us today
104:14 - friday yeah so have a great weekend
104:16 - hopefully i'll stream again next week
104:18 - and uh
104:21 - yeah if you want
104:25 - i don't know if i have this up on github
104:27 - yet yet or not i was going to say if
104:29 - anybody wants to try to like load this
104:31 - and work on these bugs feel free
104:33 - but i'm not sure if i have this up on
104:34 - github
104:36 - if i do have it up on github the link
104:37 - will be in the description
104:39 - uh if not i'll try to get it up there
104:41 - and throw the link in the description at
104:42 - some point soon so
104:45 - anyway until next time have a great
104:47 - weekend thank you so much for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm glad to be back it's been a while and uh today we're going to work on our react native browser editor which we started working on a while ago it's been like four or five months so uh just to give a give an intro to the show and the project since this it's been a long time and there's probably a lot of people that are new uh and this in this stream uh what i'm trying to do is work on a real project and i don't rehearse beforehand so there's going to be mistakes but that's the point is just to show you what it's really like to work on something to make mistakes and to to work through those mistakes so the format is i will do 25 minutes where i code and i don't really look at the live chat very much and then i'll take a five minute break i'll look at the live chat and i'll answer questions and i usually do like maybe two sessions like that then at the end i'll look at the live chat and try to answer as many questions as i can so if you have questions just be patient i'll get to them the recording of this live stream is available just a few minutes after the live stream ends so if you have a question but you can't wait for the answer then check out the recording and i'll probably uh answer your question at some point during the stream um feel free to ask ask questions uh if you're a beginner you know don't worry about you know asking questions about even just really basic stuff that's totally fine uh try to keep the live chat positive so um you know i will uh if there's any like harassment or negative stuff or anything like that i'll just block you from the chat so i think that's it in terms of introduction for the stream but in terms of the project what i'm trying to do is i want to get for this demo right we're just using create react app to make a a little proof of concepts so that we can edit react native code in a browser and have it display right there in the browser so very similar to what you would see on freecodecamp.org where you know you have like the split screen and you can type in html and javascript and then have the result appear that's what we want but we wanted to do we wanted to happen with react native code so i just happen to look over the stream someone says can you say the start and end timing uh the streams usually end up being like around an hour sometimes a little bit more than an hour so that's what i'm that's what i'm usually going for and i see a ton of people saying hi so hey everybody uh thanks for watching and i am gonna get started now so i'm gonna bring up a pomodoro timer on my other screen here and i wanted to get started by upgrading packages right so this is the the same project that we left off on months ago i've done nothing to it right so i want the stream to be as realistic as possible sometimes this happens you come back to an old project and i'm coming back to this project after a long time and i want to update the packages right for whatever reason it won't run so i did try to run it just a few minutes ago and i'm not even gonna mess with that error because i know that all my packages are at least you know a few months out of date uh so i'm gonna go through how to how to do an upgrade like like a mass upgrade here so i'm gonna do i'm using yarn uh instead of npm okay so that's just a um an alternative package manager for javascript packages for npm packages so we can do yarn upgrade and then i'm going to give it the flag latest actually let me do upgrade interactive latest i believe that's the that's the command let's see yep that's it all right so i'm going to make this bigger and hopefully the font's big enough i don't know that i could go much bigger and still display things on the screen so this is what happens when you type in when you do yarn upgrade interactive it gives you a little display here that um tells you what packages you're using that are out of date and how out of date it is right so it'll say like this is where you're at this is where you need to go right so and uh it gives you a little like color code right so red means there's been a major update and it's backward incompatible right so that means like there's breaking changes and it looks like all of the stuff it's showing me at the top here is red now there there is more right so as i scroll down it keeps showing me more so you can see a lot of our stuff is it's out of date wow we're almost all into the into the red here right wow i think it just keeps keeps scrolling through so we're not we don't have an endless list of packages it just keeps starting back at the beginning so um yeah see it just keeps scrolling but let's uh let's start somewhere and see what we actually want to update in reality i i really want to try to update everything and then see what happens okay since this is still like a work in progress i'm okay with breaking it right we we're using git so we can always just roll it right back so i can just run now that we've seen it instead of going through and like picking one by one uh what i want let's see better chances i think i'm gonna get out of this so i'm gonna ctrl c to get out of it and then let's go with i'm at let's go with yarn upgrade and i'm going to get rid of the interactive i'm just gonna do upgrade and then i'm gonna say latest and this should do all the upgrading without giving us an option of what to upgrade it's just going to upgrade everything to the latest okay so this is going to take probably a minute or two which is fine because it's going to give me a chance to check the live chat for a little bit now i kind of expect that things aren't going to work when we do this because there's so many breaking changes and that's okay i just now is the time to try to update you you don't want to keep your packages like so out of date all the time right ideally we would have been working on this um and this this whole time in the past four or five months and when a package went out of date we would have updated it okay but that didn't happen so we're gonna try this we're gonna see what errors we get and my plan is if we get if the errors are just so crazy that it's going to take forever then we will just start a new project and basically copy and paste what we need to over since we didn't get that far into this project right wow that was fast i expected that to take longer but that seemed to be kind of it worked well okay um in our package json should be updated so um let's let's check some of these dependencies like all right so our react dependency yeah wow that is is that the latest well okay all right so that did work so let's just try to run it if this actually runs i'm gonna be like really surprised all right so it didn't it didn't run okay um interesting all right well now we got an error we know at least somewhere to start um let's see just checking this out the live chat out just for a second okay um all right so let's check this out in our components workspace dot js i am using visual studio code uh as my my code editor workspace and movie ads workspace.js and we're getting an error on line 111 oh okay so this is a let's see experimental hts configuration oh okay so this is just the config issue so um let's see if it tells us so the experimental decorators option do we have a config i don't think i have a config for my linter right now that was should be yeah babel should be handling this okay so what we've done in this project is we've pulled in a lot of code from another open source project and we're trying to adapt that so this is some of that code from that other project they're using in experimental syntax and so that's where we're getting this this error from uh so what i'm thinking now is at first i thought okay maybe this is just a linting error meaning like our linter linters check your code for errors um and if you're using experimental things you have to tell your linter that like hey i'm gonna use this experimental stuff i know it's gonna look like it's broken but it's not right but now i'm seeing like maybe tonight it's saying parsing error right maybe i'm not actually transpiling that so if you want to use an experimental feature in javascript you need to use a transpiler so you usually it's this this tool called babel and what babel does is it takes your your experimental code and it transforms it into normal javascript that a browser can handle so um if that's the issue then we need to make sure that babel can handle that uh so i do have something in babel for um for decorators right which that's what i i believe that's what we were using yeah uh but for whatever reason this is not working so see let's see let's look at i guess the first thing to look at would be the project i want to see how they set up babel for the uh for the project that i got this code from you might just be able to copy and paste from there and and this would work right so let's do that first so i'm gonna bring over a browser window actually you know i think i have i think i have the project open yep i do there we go let's bring this browser window over so this is the no that's not it i had too many projects open that's sweet okay okay so it's a search for it or i could just check the package jason are we bringing in there we go this is the that's the person that is just doing this so just search for this person on github there we go github knew what i wanted uh okay so let's check out pebble all right that's it that's the same so we got the same babel config make this all bigger team battle config and let's see all right something to chat is saying something to just use okay let's see let's try it let's try it out who is this so uh fred will let's try it out too soon if i use it like this your legacy linter options in your vs code settings they're no longer being used oh interesting yeah i don't want to remove them right now i don't want to deal with that right now okay um all right should we change that and let's do it and it looks like we get a new error is that it i believe we did all right cool so shout out to fred because that seemed to at least get us around like our our linter is still complaining but at least we got past the the air i was afraid that we would have had like similar usage in a lot of other places and it would have been a mess but i guess we don't so that's who we have uh workspace line which is do not use import syntax to configure webpack loaders all right let's check this out and also i think so it has been a while since we've imported this code so it's probably worth checking out this workspace.js file in the uh the repo that we just brought in yeah i mean let's see components workspace uh in case this has been updated since the last time yeah it does it does not look like it's been updated you can see it's june 5th 2017 right so definitely not not updated all right and my lost track of where i put my pomodoro timer that i had set there it is all right cool in about five or six minutes i'm gonna take a break and i'm gonna answer some questions so just hang in there if you got any questions in the chat all right so let's search for i believe i did copy and paste the the error yep oh cool it looks like it's just a linter thing so interesting okay so esl so i guess i could just disable that for a line how do i turn off all right so i'm going to stack overflow this seems to just be a linting thing and so i don't remember how to disable eslint for a line so yes i'm disabled oh cool swedes so we should just be able to eslint yes lent disable line and then put the name of what the rule that we want to disable so let's try that out oops there we go yes oops all right let's see if it is nice all right cool so that that actually did work so good to know you can disable a single line in eslint and just disable that particular rule import and body reorder the top all right that's that's easy so let's go to our index.js which it's kind of weird that i had that in there and it ever worked right all right i might just i might have to deal with this this issue because it keeps popping up and annoying me all right we're getting through we're getting through the errors um unexpected use of history no restricted that's weird i would not have thought that that would give i would give this error but i guess so all right let's see if we just can disable this line as well yes disable i already forget what the what i just typed in the other one was what am i looking for what was this eslint disable disable line here's a disabled line no restricted nice uh i took it to take us back to that uh looks like that the little switch that we put in here and is still not working so we're going to take a little break and i'm going to answer some questions and then when we come back we're going to go back to this decorators decorative legacy isn't currently enabled um we're going to look at this decorator issue all right so i'm going to scroll all the way up to the top and go down through and try to answer some questions as many as i can it looks like i may not have access to the questions at the top so there's been a lot of activity in the chat um so if you ask your question like super early like before the stream started i may not see it uh of course of course this is i'll get a question says can i get an eightdigit salary after doing this course probably not eight digits is pretty it's a lot let's see all right so uh oncon says um a very big um beginner and react js want to learn very enthusiastic about the course uh thanks hunca and i just want to clarify so this this live stream is not exactly a course right so this is um it's it's not meant to be a tutorial that where i'll take you through like from beginning to end and you'll learn concepts and things like that this is a look into um like a real project it's a lot of troubleshooting right like we like we have right now is you know we're trying something that you would normally have to do right like projects get out of date you have to update packages this is what happens when you update packages when you wait too long you try to update packages you get errors the errors are in code that i didn't write myself right which is this happens like really at you know you come into a project you inherit someone else's code right so the idea in the stream is to try to be as close as possible to a real developer experience right because um that way uh there are things that you learn from just doing that you wouldn't necessarily learn from a course and that's i think the value in this in this live stream is when things don't go right and there aren't instructions for how to fix it like what do you do so that's what we're doing here so it's it's not exactly a course but hopefully we'll all learn something as we as we could okay it looks like um there were some discussions and like some questions are getting answered like in the chat by other people so i'm going to kind of like scroll past that um abishak is asking about what's what's best software or ai so artificial intelligence and i'm assuming for for a degree so what's best for a degree software or artificial intelligence um i'm not really sure about that one i don't know enough about it to know what what a better degree would be um i mean i do know if like you don't need a degree to do software work but probably if you want to be on like the cutting edge of ai research like in a university they're probably going to want you to have a doctorate's degree i'm assuming i don't know for sure of course there are companies that are also on the cutting edge of ai research that you wouldn't maybe necessarily need to be a doctor have a doctorate degree to work on it saad says what programming language should i start with new to programming which should i start with really you can start with anything uh javascript is an easy one to start with because it can run in the browser uh so and and you can there's a lot of free resources for it it's a nice one to learn it can run clientside and serverside but realistically if you're just starting out just to learn the programming concepts you can start out with anything and you're going to learn the same the same concepts and then switch to you know whatever you you need to but if you want to go the route of like freecodecamp.org and with those lessons then the first programming language you'll learn will be uh javascript all right cool so my timer my five minute timer is up i'm going to start a new pomodoro session of 25 minutes and we're going to get back to the code i'll come back to the questions looks like there's a ton of questions which is awesome so but i'll come back to those questions after after this next coding session all right so i'm going to copy and paste this part so when i get errors like this oh you probably can't see let me you probably can't see the whole message here so um yeah my face is blocking out the entire message but basically when i get an error message uh i i want to try to copy and paste the part that doesn't have uh reference to my project in particular right because when i search for that nobody's gonna have that right so so the name of the file workspace.js i don't want that and i don't want the um like the location of the error in terms of the the line in my file right but if there's anything that seems generic that's what i want to copy and paste so we'll see in a second what i'm what i've decided to copy and paste so i'm going to leave this linting thing up so i can keep referencing it because i'm sure i'll um i'll forget the syntax again all right but i've what i've pasted is this decorators support for experimental syntax decorators legacy isn't currently enabled right and hey there's a whole medium article on it that's interesting i'm going to open the stack overflow as well because that's usually the most helpful but i'm interested to see what is there's an entire medium article that is titled the exact name of the error that we got so that's awesome i don't know that i've ever had that happen before so let's see what we need to do let's see how old this is first okay so it's from this year it's from may 4th so that's relatively new all right let's do this so let me make this bigger so you can kind of see this but this is great i can't believe whoever wrote it who wrote this patrick so shout out to patrick for writing a medium article all about this error all right so we're going to install this new battle plugin and try to use that instead of the other battle plugin that we had so it's possible since so much time has elapsed that the old battle plugin it just isn't supported anymore maybe that's that's why we're having some issues so we're installing that and now let's bumble plug in i think we have a babble rc so that's let's use this one so there there are two different types of configuration files for for babel so that's why there's two different here so you can have a babble.config.js and the syntax is a little different for each one so or you can have a dot babel rc so i believe we have a dot babel rc yep and we do so in our plugins i i'm guessing i can just get rid of this this transform decorators legacy and all right it doesn't like the um the difference in and the quotation works so here we go what is this incorrect type expected oh it thinks i'm trying to use typescript all right and i believe it did say in that thing to restart so let's try it oh no we still getting the same error yep all right let's see so let me double check this shoot all right let's try let's try the stack overflow one looks like is there no all right so i don't think they actually selected an answer that worked but this one does have the most votes which this seems like the same thing the other thing i can think of is maybe since we use create react app it's not picking up this um babel rc file so let's check that out so um create react app is a great tool to start a react project but it does limit you a little bit in stuff like this um so in in like anything that has to do with a custom webpack uh configs which we're starting to get into like webpack uh stuff here so or at least related to webpack so let's go let's see so i'm just typing in um use dot babble rc with the cr with create react app so when i do um any search i usually try to say i just want stuff from the past year because i don't want out of date out of date stuff there we go using custom let's see what this is this is for a different project but you might have to use cut okay i wasn't sure if we'd have to use this or not but it looks like we might i might have to use customize create react app let me make sure i'm not already using it uh where's our package json yeah all right so let's do that this is actually this is gonna be fun okay so if you need to modify your um create react app um like your webpack config or your babel stuff for create react app there's a plugin you can use called customize create react app actually customize cra right so we're gonna go to their github page so that we can see what we need to add so it does use react app rewired okay which from what i understand react app rewired was like the first way that came out that you could do stuff like this um but it's now customized create react app is kind of sorry this like built on top of that so that's why we need both so let's do this so this potentially could cause problems with create react app projects so only use it if you really need to use it i've had success using it on projects it hasn't like messed up anything before so um but just be aware that you know it can throw things off all right so now that we have that in there let me let me double check to make sure there's we don't need to do anything else usage config overrides all right so we do need a config overrides file and actually oh it doesn't have it i was hoping it would have that would have something in there so sorry what's the name of this file config overrides.js there we go so let's make a config overrides.js file and so we're going to make this just in the root of our project config overrides.js and i'm going to copy and paste just to get us started there we go and a lot of this we don't need like really we i want to add this decorator's legacy and actually disabling eslint is probably not a bad idea since we're getting ldts and errors but this is just in webpack um that's cool whatever is i'll need that and i don't need this all right and so now we don't need these and all right let's see if that'll work i'm gonna manually restart this ah decorate his legacy it's still not working okay hmm i wonder why why are we getting this hmm alright so we have all right it looks like we have everything that we've seen hmm all right let's go back let's get rid of that one and this is about focus okay we haven't looked at this one yet this is just in general how you use babel plugins with create react app so probably not a bad idea to look over this just to make sure that we did it right all right we do we want to use our babble rc okay this might be this might be it so we don't we're not going to pull this in directly we wanted to use battle rc now now it should actually look at our battle rc file oh and i need to change change this all right i can't believe i forgot this okay so before create react app actually starts how did i not see this in the documentation like this is not in here that's kind of weird um okay anyway so uh let's check our package.json file here so we want to run instead of running when our when we run our scripts um instead of running it through react scripts we want to run it through react app rewired and that was that was probably our issue so stuff this may have actually worked before the way we had it and now it so now it will run through react app rewired so let's see on x force override bevel rc is not defined use valve or c is not defined yep you are correct he's battle rushing now it's going to use our new stuff all right we got a new error sweet so let's go back to our code our new error is plugin preset files are not allowed to export objects only functions whoa this is actually a problem in our node modules that's wild that's pretty crazy because like this is it's a node much uh all right let's look this up and let's get rid of some windows while we're at it maybe are we using we're not using a new version of babble all right eight seven six five five you could probably uh what um i hear my kids in the background so that's it they're on their way to school uh there's a question here isn't react native browser just react.js no it's not so what we're trying to do is is say that you can type into a browser window like a like an editor an in browser editor react native code and then have that code actually run and display in the browser right in a little like window in the browser right so we need the code to be converted into something that the browser can understand like on the fly in the browser and so it's it's not um it's not running react native so that it can go in the browser right it's not just that it's it's actually trying to convert the react native code on the fly in the browser the the use case for this is being able to have online tutorials online react native tutorials where someone doesn't have to go through everything necessary to run react native on their local machine and they can just go into the browser and type it in and type in actual react native code and then see what the result would be right um so you're making a thing kind of compiler to javascript yeah basically yeah yeah it's it's like it's going to be like an inbrowser compiler of react native to normal javascript okay sorry i got kind of off track from the coding but that was i think i needed to clarify that otherwise what we're doing is not going to make that much sense okay so it looks like babel preset es2015 okay so this is is um i believe related to like a new way that babel's doing its stuff so like you see that it says at sign babble right so this is the way we should be doing it and instead we're doing it this this older way so we need to switch things up so instead of like for instance a set of reactors should be at battle reactor you need to install uh preset react so that's what we need to do next right now my timer is up though so i'm going to answer some questions okay well you need to pull them out and what um you need to answer some questions and then on our next live stream this is where we'll go so actually if i have time i might try to sort this out before the next live stream um but otherwise then we'll kind of just pick up here with switching over our babel stuff to use the latest and it looks like the reason we didn't see this error before is because our create react app was just completely bypassing our babble rc so we had it in here but it this was never running which i mean that makes sense so anyway let me go to the chat and i'm gonna scroll up to where i left off at i'm gonna try to get as many questions as i can in um so i may not be able to get to all the questions since i do have to start my my normal job so i i'm a software engineer and um so if i don't get your question you can always put it in the comments to the video um and then i can try to answer it later on okay all right so we have a question what is react all right so react is a javascript library um for building apps and so it just it gives you this um it helps mostly with state management and it gives you an html like syntax called jsx that lets you kind of mix together html what looks like html with javascript and create create apps so that's super high level but basically like if you want to make web apps then react helps you do that okay uh dragon stone creation says the fan is noisy can you reduce speed i'm sorry about that you know what i'm right now i'm set up uh in my basement so i believe the uh the heater was running um so apologies for that i i have plans to put up some walls around my work area and uh like soundproof it but hasn't happened yet uh so i'm hoping i can get that done soon and um then the noise won't be an issue so i'm sure you can hear like the garage door shutting now and you could hear my kids coming down so uh not an ideal situation for live streaming but um if i waited for everything to be ideal then i probably would never live stream okay i got a question will you save the stream yeah the stream the stream does get recorded and it's available to watch uh on the free code camp channel and dragonstone creation says if so many packages are outdated in a short time when building a huge project uh won't it be a problem yeah it's definitely a problem uh so i actually yesterday at my my job i went through two of the the apps that were building and i i upgraded all of the packages and i do that pretty regularly because if you wait like we've done here in this project until you get so many things outdated you can see there's a lot of errors that we're working through so it's much easier to say like okay i'm gonna go through and you could just set a time for your project if you really want to like all right once a month i'm going to check or you know whatever amount of time you set you can say i'm going to check the projects if there are some packages that are like really like key packages that you're using you might want to just say every time there's a new release i'm going to read through the release notes see what what is happening if there were less packages we probably would have done that we probably would have read through the release notes on github and seen if there were any breaking changes and then tried to fix those according to the instructions uh that the the um package maintainers set so in this case there was just too much so i thought hey let's just go for it see what happens um also you know this this isn't like um a critical application or anything like that so we could afford to break it okay but yeah in a big app that's like actually in use you'd want to stay on top of this and not let your stuff get out of date um servant says are you coding with expo uh not for this particular project but i do code with expo pretty much every day i do i like expo uh if you're not sure what expo is it's uh it's a set of tools i guess that help you build with react native react native is a way to use react to build mobile apps primarily mobile apps you can build other stuff with it too but the number one use case is android and ios anderson uh silva says i'm a software engineer at google that's awesome i um i did interview with google uh this was probably a year ago and i made it all the way to like when you get on campus and do like uh you know i think it's like five interviews on campus in a day uh but i didn't make it past there so maybe one day i'll interview with him again we'll see but um that's cool i did actually i did a video about it too so if you wanna if anybody's interested in what it's like to interview at google you can check it out uh so i i think it's on the free code cam channel it's also on my channel so uh if you like this stream and want to see more stuff you can check out uh my youtube channel the links in the description uh fred mentioned my node version that i need node 10 plus so i think this is when we were dealing with that that first error that decorator error okay so uh i'm not exactly sure what node version i'm running on my machine right now but i don't know that that would matter would that matter for because i think because we're trying to use it clientside it wouldn't necessarily matter serverside it definitely would luisi's his eunuchs and diamonds are forever actually that's pretty much true eunuchs is everywhere uh cherry vanilla asks what language this is javascript says can we add babble rc to normal react projects oh well i wish i would have seen that earlier because um that that actually was part of our issue is that you can't just add a battle or c to normal recreate react app projects right you have to do customize create react ad so good catch on that one uh charbelle says how will the web editor compile code that's a great question and uh so actually we're using uh service workers so like the compile stuff happens here in our babelworker.js so it basically like we're taking what what happens like on your local machine when you so uh there is a there is a package called react native web which takes react native and converts it into um basically html css and javascript that a browser can use but it does that right locally on your machine so we're taking that and using it in a service worker so that it happens every time you type in something uh in your browser right so like it's it's really cool but that's basically that's how we get it to work is like in place of your local machine we have a service worker running okay uh anderson silva says why are you using a dark theme github uh i just i like dark theme so yeah i have the dark theme github theme so it's i'm just using a tamper monkey script it's if you look up github dark i think you'll um you'll see like instructions for how to do a github dark theme i just prefer it especially when i'm coding like i have the dark theme on my code editor and to switch to github like it's just this flash of bright uh it when you have the white background so it's better to have as for me at least i prefer to have as much stuff as i can on the dark mode easier on my eyes anderson silva says you don't like linux i like linux oh man and fred fred came through with the uh syntax to disable eslint disable next line so thank you for that i didn't see it in the comments but that would have been helpful um i need to get back in the hang of live streaming since it's been a while of like glancing back and forth at the comments um i'll get there uh looks like there's a lot of discussion about in the chat so i'm still i'm scrolling through looking for questions auggie says hello jesse i'm from indonesia i love to watch yuko's awesome thanks thanks for watching uh let's see you have a question wrote ronique not sure how to pronounce that for sure so apologies if i'm mispronouncing that but anyway it says which platform is easier to deploy from react native or expo i have two mobile apps i want to build i am familiar with react and i have created a simple react native app right unclear all right one clear which is better um i think expo makes it uh easier to deploy like in terms of actually deploying to the app store to deploy and update uh so i would check out expo in general when you're using react native i recommend always using expo unless you have some reason like something you need to do in your app that you can't do with expo and even then you could always start with it and then eject but there there are so many expo handles so much for you um that it just kind of makes it a nicer developer experience so definitely recommend using that for react native um that boss says do you have a telegram channel or group i don't think we have a telegram i'm not 100 sure like i definitely don't for the live stream i don't know if free code camp does does anybody know free code camp has a telegram it's possible that we do and i just don't know about it um if i want to be an effective full stack developer should i take a cyber security course to be an effective full stack developer uh i don't think it's necessary to take a cyber security course to be full stack um if that's with what you're into and you want to like specialize in that that's fine it definitely wouldn't hurt you but i wouldn't say it's necessary uh santo says can you please use dart mode for browser dark mode for browser i thought i was using dark mode in my browser i'm not sure santu could you elaborate on that question uh jamal asked would getting a certificate be better than getting a degree because i'm in college and a little lost because of it uh it it depends on what you want to do jamal really um if you want to do like web development then you probably you know don't need a degree you could get and you don't need a certificate either you just need a portfolio you need some experience uh but different different aspects of like coding it it it just depends so like it depends on where you're at what country you're in certain certain places or certain industries still prefer a degree um so you would definitely need to i would need more information let's say to be able to tell for sure right like can you get a good job without a without a degree yeah definitely in in uh some in some type of coding um but if there's something you really specifically want to do then it may be more helpful to get a degree maybe not uh thomas says do you all understand what he's coding i'm new to coding and i have no clue uh thomas don't worry about it like feel free to ask any questions we did just we like we just jumped into this project so um it's it's definitely okay to be a little bit confused like in reality like this is like i'm a little bit lost right we're trying to work through bugs and everything uh so that's uh totally understandable um to be a little lost all right we're just like jumping right back into a project that we haven't some of you have not seen it all before i haven't looked at it in four months so um that's a that's a legitimate uh feeling to have uh let's see just trying to scroll through and find actual questions there's a lot of a lot of comments and stuff uh thomas says uh not a question but just wanted to say thanks for teaching me a lot of concepts that i know now uh your videos have been very helpful thank you i appreciate that um lupendra says is there any relation or similarity between react js and react native uh yeah definitely so um a lot of the concepts are the same um so like the way you handle state uh is the same in react.js and react native uh like the structure of the the jsx syntax is the same uh so uh honestly they're react native and react in terms of how you develop things like from the developer perspective uh of trying to build something with them are very very similar so um you know you're just you're using components to build apps the differences are mainly in what components you can use right so in react you can use what we call like dom primitives so divs spans p tags h h tag stuff like that you can't use that in react native so that's that's probably the biggest difference when you're developing right so there are other tags that come with react native that you would use in in that place but like if whether you start with react native or if you start with react switching from one to the other is not very difficult uh gavin says have you used ionic with react what do you think of it i've never used ionic with react i did use i've used ionic but this was probably like i don't know six years ago i used ionic so i thought it was really cool when i did use it um i probably wouldn't use it now uh ionic is a way to build um mobile apps with javascript so i probably wouldn't use it ionic with react if i wanted to build a mobile app using react i would just use react native so i don't know unless there's some benefit to using ionic with react that i don't know about that's which way i would go if i if i wanted to use java some other javascript framework to build a an app then i probably would go with ionic all right i'm getting down towards the end of the chat so let's see i'm trying to find the questions here okay here's one um why most of programmers are arrogant i don't know i don't know are programmers arrogant um maybe i don't i don't really know maybe that's a psychology question that's not my my area so i hope i don't come off as arrogant if i do i apologize uh there's some uh i saw a few questions about people saying i just joined the stream what are we doing um check out the uh recording and you know go back to the beginning and then uh you'll get a good explanation of what's what's happening uh the i.t thinker says where are you reading the questions from i'm just reading them from the chat so i'm just scrolling down through the chat log and uh and reading the questions decoder says hey i cannot find any of these questions in this chat um yeah maybe it was because i was way back at the beginning of the jet okay is it possible to convert angular to react developer okay so you mean like you you're an angular developer and you want to become a react developer yeah i mean that's definitely possible if the question is is it possible to convert an angular app to a react app then that that would be pretty difficult you would have to like basically rewrite it okay and now the question is which is better angular or react um that it just entirely depends it depends on what you're trying to build um what your team is good with or what you're good with already so that's that's a tough question to answer without any other any other information let's see uh abby scheck says i'm not able to run c plus in windows 10 what should i do i don't i don't have any experience with trying to run c plus in windows 10 so i unfortunately i can't answer your question yeah i don't i don't know the last time i did anything with c plus plus i was in probably in 2009 yeah try 2 000 and no it was before that it was probably 2005. so it's been quite a while since i've done anything with c plus plus so uh sorry i can't can't help with that um how many days to learn react oh i i don't know it depends on how much you already know um how many hours per day you can you can dedicate to it uh jaeger says why is common.js and import syntax in that file like both of them to take truth i'm not entirely sure why they're both in there i don't remember if i did that or if that was some code i copied and pasted in i don't know uh truong says uh could you teach us soft skills um i don't know about in the stream uh but i guess um i could talk about soft skills maybe not maybe that would be like better for a video like on my channel i do more like um recorded video tutorials maybe that would be good but it's hard to teach like i could talk about it but teaching it would probably take like a lot of actual like practice and experience and stuff uh carlos says i just want to say thank you for sharing your time and knowledge keep up the good work oh thanks i appreciate it and thanks for watching um abhishek says can you assure can can you talk about the stability of a job without a degree um yeah honestly i here's the way i feel about job stability with or without a degree it seems like at least so i'm coming from the united states um i live near pittsburgh in the united states so it may not it's it's probably different in other places but it seems to me like like i personally don't count on stability uh in my job so um i i'm always trying to be ready like try to keep my res my resume my linkedin updated try to keep my skills updated and because i don't count on always being able to work at the same place that i'm working uh so you have companies like if you're at a small company small companies got a business or get bought out like all the time right so you're probably not going to have much job stability if you're at a startup or a small company but even large companies they they change things they restructure they you know they fire employees things change so frequently that i just think it's better to assume that no matter what you're probably not going to have much job stability right so my assumption for myself is that i'll probably change jobs every few years um and so i just try to keep myself prepared for that so just making sure that i keep track of like what is the most in demand uh what are the most in demand skills right now what should i be learning like trying to go to conferences and um talk to people like in terms of networking and stuff so that's how i i feel i don't i don't know that having a degree would it like in the software engineering field i don't know that having a degree would make you have more or less job stability in other fields like in general just in life having a degree probably would help you to get more jobs because there's still a lot of jobs out there that they just want a degree no matter what even if it doesn't make sense for you to have a degree but if you want to stick with software engineering once you get to the point where you have some job experience the degree really doesn't matter that much for most software engineering jobs hopefully that answered your question um donae says what is best between an android app or a single page app um that that really kind of depends like um on what what you're trying to do uh a single page app would run in the browser um obviously so like an android app is gonna be a mobile app for the phone so it it's i don't know that it's a question of what's the best in general it would be like what what is the goal like what's the what is the app which is supposed to be doing what's the goal um visager says what's the best place for finding a job online for angular or react um this is the places that i like to go for finding a job online so uh believe it or not twitter is a good place if you like let people know on twitter that you're looking i've had a lot of a lot of good luck with uh people contacting me about jobs on twitter uh linkedin uh there's a place what is it called zip recruiter zip recruiter um i like it because they show a lot of like salary information which is good to know like up front and then stack overflow has a job site so those are probably the places that i would recommend uh looking it but that's coming from somebody in the united states if you're in different parts of the world i don't know how helpful those places are there might be other websites that are better but that's where i would i would check uh amir says react native or flutter uh i haven't used flutter so i don't really think i could give a good comparison i do really like react native i've heard good things about flutter but like i just i don't know enough about it i think to really do a good job of of talking about why you would want to use it or not use it compared to react native jmo vlogs says what's your favorite coding language i like javascript i mean it's it's what i code with most often not that i don't like other languages but if i had to pick a favorite i'd probably say job is good um or do novels says can can we watch a recorded version of the session yep the recording will be available probably just a few minutes after i end this one let's see um all right abby scheck says who gets more salary a person with or without a degree and this is from india so i to be honest with you i don't know very much at all about the job market in india so i don't know that i can answer that question so uh if there's anybody from india that has any experience with that please you know maybe uh throw an answer out here or if you're watching the recording maybe later on in the uh in the comments um pat patsell says uh great job how can i how can i become a good programmer can i do that by reading people's code yeah reading other people's code definitely helps give you more ideas about how to do things but i would say more than just reading it is like actually working with it so like if you see an open source project like i think it's even more helpful instead of just reading it try to actually contribute to it then you really start to understand it like how it works and i think that will help you to become a better programmer because you'll hopefully pick up on all the good ideas that other programmers are having and like start incorporating that into your project i know like i i worked on an open source project recently i did some streams on it on my youtube channel it was the react native async storage package and that package was using typescript and so i had to learn typescript to contribute and now i've incorporated typescript into my other projects so it's like i kind of absorbed some of that and and just you know it's made my code better by contributing uh to this other project uh let's see i gotta make sure i keep track of time so i can work all right so we'll do a few more questions uh before i wrap this up um let's see he had a job as a junior dev for eight months and left on good terms i know front end with ujs would you learn back end to go full stack or just look for another frontend position um honestly like if i needed to find a job i needed money i would just look for a frontend position and like try to learn as i go uh if like i really wanted to go full stack and i didn't need a job right away then yeah maybe learn learn back end but so it kind of depends on your situation um can you talk about coding bootcamp thank you i have never done a coding bootcamp so i don't know that much about it my wife did do a coding boot camp and she loved it and she got a job right away um so she did the flat iron school boot camp so i think boot camps can be really helpful but you got to make sure you're going to a good boot camp so do your research first and probably like see you check out where the people are working that have gone through that boot camp right because that's the proof of whether or not the boot camp is gonna get you ready for a job like have people already gone through this boot camp and gotten jobs uh and don't just look at what the boot camp says like look at their people who've actually gone to the boot camp you know and like maybe try to reach out to him on twitter or something and say like hey you did this boot camp like what did you think of it um jmovlog says where's the best place to find conferences talks networking opportunities um let's see you can uh so this might be a weird way to look for conferences but if you go to papercall.io you can search for uh conferences and events and you can search by keyword so you could type in like javascript to react and you could find a bunch of conferences and events um uh there i think it's just tech conferences that they have on there so that might not be a bad way to to check it out andre says i'm assuming this is the question is do i really need to use redux in all react projects you definitely don't need redux in all your react projects so i i rarely use redux in my react projects i only use redux if it gets to the point where it's really the state management starts to get very complex and i feel like it could be helpful to use redux let's see xeno says for half hour i just listened and watched slot of nothing um yeah the at the end of the uh stream we just do question and answer so um yeah so if the coding is the first part of the stream second part is question and answer uh cyberworld asked to when do you start your coding coding is the first so like we're done with the coding at this point so um uh mulik says can you tell me the learning curve to be a front end dev for example html css js likewise yeah i don't know i don't know exactly how to explain the learning curve i guess but yeah like that's that's the way you'd want to go right like if you want to be a frontend developer start with html css javascript then uh maybe check out some sort of framework um like once you learn html css and javascript i would like start building stuff don't wait to actually build stuff and then then you'll start to get a feel for like oh you know i'm doing this this thing over and over again maybe there's some library that does it for me right that's kind of like um i think you kind of naturally need to branch out or want to branch out and learn other libraries and things okay yeah zeno um so i'm yeah i'm not going to code anymore for this stream so like for the first hour we code and then after that we uh do question and answer all right all right last question and then we'll be done it says why react and not view um i i work with react i know react i don't know of you i mean that's really it like i so i work with react at my job and i've been working with react for a while so um that's what i'm good with so that's what i'm gonna work with um if you use a good framework as well i haven't done anything with it but i've heard good things about it so but yeah that's why we're doing we don't react stuff you wouldn't want to watch me do a view stream because i'm no good with you i don't know anything about it all right so anyway thank you so much for watching i'm going to try to stream more regularly um now and get back into it and um yeah so i'm trying to put us today friday yeah so have a great weekend hopefully i'll stream again next week and uh yeah if you want i don't know if i have this up on github yet yet or not i was going to say if anybody wants to try to like load this and work on these bugs feel free but i'm not sure if i have this up on github if i do have it up on github the link will be in the description uh if not i'll try to get it up there and throw the link in the description at some point soon so anyway until next time have a great weekend thank you so much for watching
