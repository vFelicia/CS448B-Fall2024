00:00 - okay let's talk about something really
00:01 - useful google fonts
00:04 - now back in 2010 google started to offer
00:07 - web fonts for free and it quickly became
00:10 - the biggest repository the fastest
00:12 - repository for free fonts to use on the
00:15 - web
00:17 - i can have fonts installed on my
00:19 - computer that's great that's wonderful
00:21 - and i can come in here and i can say
00:24 - that i want to set the font family
00:26 - to something that i have installed on my
00:28 - computer
00:29 - that's going to work for me if i'm
00:30 - looking on my web pages
00:33 - on my browser on my computer
00:35 - but somebody else may not have that same
00:37 - font installed that's why we build font
00:39 - stacks with the fallbacks
00:42 - google fonts or web fonts in general
00:45 - this is how we
00:47 - use some really nice fonts that are
00:49 - available for free
00:52 - i could in theory upload a font from my
00:55 - computer to a web server link to it from
00:58 - there and then anybody in the world can
00:59 - use it but if i don't have a license for
01:01 - it
01:02 - then i i'm guilty of copyright
01:05 - infringement there are fonts that are
01:07 - designed to be used for print publishing
01:09 - there's fonts that are designed to be
01:10 - used for the web there's ones that are
01:12 - free and there's ones that are paid
01:14 - google fonts is a collection of free
01:16 - ones you don't have to pay anything to
01:18 - use them google wants people to
01:21 - use nicer fonts to have nicer looking
01:23 - web pages
01:24 - so let's say for the sake of argument
01:27 - that i'm building this page
01:28 - and i want to use a serif font for my
01:32 - headings
01:33 - and then
01:34 - i want to use
01:36 - a sans-serif font for my body text so i
01:40 - have whatever my system wants to use is
01:42 - the serif and the sans serif right now
01:44 - i'm going to use google fonts to bring
01:46 - in and use some nicer fonts
01:49 - so
01:50 - the website
01:51 - fonts.google.com pretty easy to remember
01:55 - and this is what it looks like these are
01:57 - different fonts
01:59 - samples of lots and lots and lots and
02:01 - lots of different fonts you can see
02:03 - how far i can scroll down here there's
02:05 - tons of fonts available
02:08 - there's a search as well that allows you
02:10 - to narrow this down because if you had
02:12 - to really look at every font it would
02:14 - take forever to
02:16 - you'd die of choices
02:18 - so let's start with the serif we're
02:20 - going to try to find one for the heading
02:22 - so i will unselect
02:25 - all the other
02:26 - categories of fonts i only want to find
02:28 - a serif one
02:30 - okay so in my
02:33 - serif groups here
02:35 - we can scroll through starting to
02:38 - look for one that we like
02:40 - or
02:41 - we can actually search for if you know
02:43 - the name of a font
02:47 - so here we go
02:49 - alegria i like this font so i'm going to
02:51 - take this one what i'm going to do
02:53 - oh yeah and on the website here you can
02:55 - also
02:57 - change the text that's being displayed
02:59 - if you want to put in a piece of text
03:01 - that you're going to be using to see how
03:02 - that's going to render you can do that
03:06 - so i'm going to click the plus sign
03:08 - right here to
03:09 - select it
03:11 - so i have one family selected now
03:14 - now for the body text i'm going to have
03:16 - a serif font for my headings and
03:19 - sans-serif fonts for my body text
03:22 - so we'll unselect that
03:23 - go down to sans-serif
03:25 - now
03:27 - the one i want to use is called open
03:30 - sans here it is so open sands
03:32 - now we can change the
03:34 - style of this to see what it looks like
03:38 - but i'm just going to add this quickly
03:40 - and then
03:41 - click on here to see
03:43 - here's the two fonts that i've selected
03:46 - and these two fonts this one's a
03:50 - serif font this is a sans-serif font
03:52 - i'm going to include these in my web
03:54 - pages
03:56 - we can
03:58 - do the standard css i can add a link tag
04:01 - i can copy and paste this link tag put
04:03 - it into my page or if you prefer the
04:06 - syntax for import we can do that
04:09 - so i'm going to do this one
04:12 - i'm going to
04:13 - copy that
04:15 - come over into here and paste
04:19 - there we are i have an at import that's
04:21 - gonna bring in
04:23 - now let's expand this to make it a
04:25 - little easier to read
04:28 - we are
04:29 - so this is the url
04:31 - that all of the fonts begin with and
04:33 - then you'll have family equals
04:36 - the names of the fonts
04:38 - if you want to specify a specific weight
04:40 - we could say instead of bringing down
04:43 - everything let's only bring down 700
04:46 - weight this is bold so i want the bold
04:48 - allegria
04:50 - and now i can come in
04:54 - here add that to my list
04:57 - and
05:00 - font weight i will set to 700
05:03 - bold
05:04 - okay i have that saved
05:07 - i'll come take a look at my page there
05:08 - we are this is the font
05:10 - so if we
05:12 - here let's
05:14 - show both at the same time here
05:17 - there we go
05:18 - if i remove this
05:21 - there we go that's the default
05:22 - serif and there it is with allegria
05:26 - we can do the same thing down here this
05:27 - is the default sans-serif font
05:29 - and then i will add open sans
05:34 - there we are so there's my my font
05:36 - pairing that i'm going to use alegria
05:38 - with 700 weight
05:39 - and open sans
05:41 - falling back to sans serif
05:44 - now
05:45 - i haven't done a full font stack here
05:47 - i've just done a web font
05:48 - and then a default
05:53 - inside here i've done the basic uh
05:55 - includes for these things
05:58 - we can also customize
06:01 - so with open sans we're bringing down
06:03 - the regular
06:05 - with allegria
06:08 - i had said 700 that was what i wanted
06:12 - now if i come back here you can see
06:14 - there's the 400 and 700 i didn't want
06:17 - the 400.
06:20 - i just wanted the 700 so i put colon 700
06:23 - you can put a comma between all the
06:25 - different weights if you want
06:28 - so
06:29 - i can remove the regular i don't need
06:31 - that and
06:33 - you'll see as you
06:35 - if you add in all of these options
06:38 - this little thing up here will change
06:40 - right now it says load time slow
06:42 - because i'm loading all these different
06:44 - versions
06:45 - if i didn't bring all these versions it
06:48 - gets to become a moderate load time and
06:50 - then a fast load time so i'm bringing in
06:52 - two fonts one font weight for each
06:55 - that's so fast languages
06:58 - well do you just need the latin do you
07:00 - need the latin extended do you need
07:01 - greek and cyrillic as well so depending
07:04 - on the font and depending on the
07:05 - languages that you need
07:07 - you can do this
07:09 - okay so i've got those selected
07:11 - one other thing that
07:14 - it doesn't show in the customization but
07:16 - you can actually
07:18 - limit
07:19 - which text gets used
07:22 - i'm just going to slide this over a
07:24 - little bit
07:28 - there we are we can come in here and say
07:32 - end
07:33 - text
07:35 - equals
07:38 - there
07:39 - g and f capital g capital f so there's
07:42 - the capital g there's the capital f
07:45 - and
07:47 - i'm only
07:49 - getting those two letters being brought
07:51 - in
07:54 - that's the only text that i'm that i'm
07:56 - bringing in those the only letters
07:58 - capital g capital f
08:00 - those are the only ones that are being
08:02 - brought in
08:03 - so
08:05 - the other letters are all fallbacks
08:09 - if i
08:10 - was to write out
08:14 - there we've got google written in
08:15 - allegria
08:19 - and now i've got fonts
08:20 - so this would be an optimizing thing you
08:22 - can do or it's something like if you
08:24 - want to do that ransom note style where
08:25 - you've got different letters for
08:27 - different things
08:28 - you can limit
08:32 - which characters are actually brought in
08:34 - as part of this so that's the
08:36 - and text i will just leave it as a
08:38 - comment here
08:44 - there we are
08:46 - okay so we've got the google font we did
08:48 - import we could have brought it in as a
08:49 - link tag as well
08:51 - we specified the weight that we want we
08:54 - can specify that we only want the 400
08:56 - here we're speeding it up by saying it's
08:58 - limited to just that weight
09:01 - that's the default
09:04 - or we can say 500 or 400
09:07 - that's the
09:08 - default weight that we're getting in
09:10 - here
09:13 - step was to talk about those fallback
09:15 - fonts we've got allegria we've got this
09:17 - the generic we've got open sounds we've
09:19 - got the generic but there's nothing in
09:20 - between so if this fails to load or if
09:23 - it's really slow to load then we want to
09:26 - have something that's much closer
09:27 - matched to this
09:29 - so
09:31 - great website here
09:33 - mioni.ca
09:35 - fantastic website
09:38 - here's the web font
09:39 - i want allegria
09:41 - that's the one that i want
09:44 - it's going to download it from google
09:46 - fonts
09:50 - can play with the size
09:52 - so let's go
09:54 - 24 pixel make this
09:56 - easier to read
09:59 - there we are line height you can play
10:01 - with the weight so 700 is what we were
10:04 - using
10:06 - there we go 700
10:10 - so georgia
10:12 - that's okay
10:13 - we could take a look at some other
10:16 - serif fonts to play around with this
10:19 - times
10:23 - times new roman
10:31 - so this is
10:32 - a sans-serif font arial so you can
10:34 - compare the difference
10:35 - um
10:36 - this is how you can go through if you've
10:38 - got a list of fonts you want to compare
10:40 - it to you can
10:42 - provide the names here to find something
10:44 - that matches
10:45 - and then the section down here at the
10:46 - bottom overlapped this is showing the
10:49 - same text with both fonts
10:51 - so options so you can show them in
10:53 - different colors so red for one black
10:55 - for the other
10:57 - and then this creates a little animation
10:59 - so you can see the difference
11:02 - fouc stands for flash of unstyled
11:06 - content
11:07 - so
11:07 - you see one
11:09 - while the web font is loading and then
11:12 - it quickly changes the goal of this is
11:15 - to have something that doesn't
11:17 - dramatically change like if i were to
11:20 - come in here and say okay this one's 16
11:23 - pixels
11:26 - that one's 38 pixels
11:29 - there you can see huge change between
11:31 - the two fonts this is not an effect that
11:34 - you want to have you want to get these
11:35 - things as close as possible to one
11:37 - another so that as you were styling them
11:41 - whatever font size you're picking it's
11:43 - the same it's going to be the same font
11:44 - size regardless of the font so you want
11:46 - to make sure that these two things
11:49 - are pretty close to one another
11:51 - now this is a bad match you would never
11:53 - replace
11:54 - alegria with ariel
11:56 - but
11:59 - palatino georgia something like that
12:02 - this is something that you could use
12:07 - as a replacement font
12:08 - all right so that's google fonts i will
12:10 - include the links for this great tool
12:12 - the links to the google fonts website
12:14 - and a code pen for this code so you can
12:16 - play around with it
12:18 - if you have any questions feel free to
12:19 - leave them in the comments below if you
12:20 - found this useful please share it with
12:22 - other people and as always thanks for
12:24 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

okay let's talk about something really useful google fonts now back in 2010 google started to offer web fonts for free and it quickly became the biggest repository the fastest repository for free fonts to use on the web i can have fonts installed on my computer that's great that's wonderful and i can come in here and i can say that i want to set the font family to something that i have installed on my computer that's going to work for me if i'm looking on my web pages on my browser on my computer but somebody else may not have that same font installed that's why we build font stacks with the fallbacks google fonts or web fonts in general this is how we use some really nice fonts that are available for free i could in theory upload a font from my computer to a web server link to it from there and then anybody in the world can use it but if i don't have a license for it then i i'm guilty of copyright infringement there are fonts that are designed to be used for print publishing there's fonts that are designed to be used for the web there's ones that are free and there's ones that are paid google fonts is a collection of free ones you don't have to pay anything to use them google wants people to use nicer fonts to have nicer looking web pages so let's say for the sake of argument that i'm building this page and i want to use a serif font for my headings and then i want to use a sansserif font for my body text so i have whatever my system wants to use is the serif and the sans serif right now i'm going to use google fonts to bring in and use some nicer fonts so the website fonts.google.com pretty easy to remember and this is what it looks like these are different fonts samples of lots and lots and lots and lots of different fonts you can see how far i can scroll down here there's tons of fonts available there's a search as well that allows you to narrow this down because if you had to really look at every font it would take forever to you'd die of choices so let's start with the serif we're going to try to find one for the heading so i will unselect all the other categories of fonts i only want to find a serif one okay so in my serif groups here we can scroll through starting to look for one that we like or we can actually search for if you know the name of a font so here we go alegria i like this font so i'm going to take this one what i'm going to do oh yeah and on the website here you can also change the text that's being displayed if you want to put in a piece of text that you're going to be using to see how that's going to render you can do that so i'm going to click the plus sign right here to select it so i have one family selected now now for the body text i'm going to have a serif font for my headings and sansserif fonts for my body text so we'll unselect that go down to sansserif now the one i want to use is called open sans here it is so open sands now we can change the style of this to see what it looks like but i'm just going to add this quickly and then click on here to see here's the two fonts that i've selected and these two fonts this one's a serif font this is a sansserif font i'm going to include these in my web pages we can do the standard css i can add a link tag i can copy and paste this link tag put it into my page or if you prefer the syntax for import we can do that so i'm going to do

thing down here this is the default sansserif font and then i will add open sans there we are so there's my my font pairing that i'm going to use alegria with 700 weight and open sans falling back to sans serif now i haven't done a full font stack here i've just done a web font and then a default inside here i've done the basic uh includes for these things we can also customize so with open sans we're bringing down the regular with allegria i had said 700 that was what i wanted now if i come back here you can see there's the 400 and 700 i didn't want the 400. i just wanted the 700 so i put
