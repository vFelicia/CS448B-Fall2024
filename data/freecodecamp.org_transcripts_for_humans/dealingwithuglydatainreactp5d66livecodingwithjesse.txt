00:03 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:05 - Jesse I'm Jesse and this is my coworker
00:08 - Adam so my hands not in the picture they
00:12 - were I have to do it the opposite way
00:14 - they yeah it is confusing to get the
00:17 - directions right but anyway yeah so he
00:21 - works with me here at Franciscan
00:23 - University and he is a writer so you
00:27 - want to say what's up
00:28 - I mean apparently like within the next
00:31 - 10 years like computers are gonna be
00:32 - able to do what I do so but for the time
00:35 - being like I yeah I write stuff and yeah
00:40 - what's up everybody
00:44 - Ohio River Valley the loveliness of May
00:49 - that's great
00:51 - it is nice and May yeah cool if anyone
00:59 - is big country music fan I feel you
01:02 - really know if anyone is on your podcast
01:04 - but I don't know nobody likes country
01:07 - music let us know in the chat or in the
01:10 - comments if you're watching this either
01:11 - on okay see Don you mean him a real cool
01:14 - so yeah but anyways I'm out lovely to
01:19 - meet you all all right cool thanks Adam
01:30 - all right so I gave my Spotify on before
01:37 - we start I am in the office today as you
01:44 - might realize from the background and
01:48 - yeah so that was Adam and he's I think
01:54 - he's the newest addition to the team so
01:57 - he he's been here for I don't know if
02:01 - it's been a year yet but he's been here
02:03 - for a while but he's he's one of the
02:05 - newer people so yeah and I'm not a
02:10 - country music fan so I'm not exactly
02:12 - sure who he was talking about when he
02:14 - said he had the hook-up so but if you
02:17 - all know then I guess you you understand
02:21 - but today we're going to work on that
02:26 - same component that we were working on
02:28 - yesterday so yesterday we had mentioned
02:33 - you know probably a few times that it
02:35 - would be great to get some other pieces
02:36 - of data and not have to actually go in
02:40 - and manually edit the data so I decided
02:44 - you know afterwards like hey you know
02:46 - what that that it would probably be
02:49 - better to just do what we have to do in
02:52 - the component to just pull in that mass
02:54 - of HTML and probably poorly formatted
02:59 - HTML and just pick out the pieces of
03:02 - data that we need and use those that
03:06 - that would take probably much less time
03:11 - not only for that particular use case
03:14 - but when we do that I I'm almost
03:17 - positive we'll find some other use cases
03:20 - where with just a few adjustments the
03:23 - same bit of code that we write today
03:24 - hopefully if it works will also work and
03:27 - save us a lot of time elsewhere because
03:28 - we're talking about in terms of
03:32 - WordPress posts I mean we're talking
03:35 - about hundreds and hundreds if if not
03:38 - into the thousands of posts so if we
03:41 - spend an hour today
03:43 - writing something that can save us from
03:46 - editing I don't know even a hundred
03:51 - posts or less that's definitely worth
03:53 - our time so I am working on getting some
03:58 - student workers to come in and maybe do
04:00 - some manual editing of the data you know
04:03 - to help out so that we don't have to do
04:04 - all kind of this weird stuff in our
04:06 - components to work with it but for right
04:09 - now this is what we have I can't count
04:11 - on that it's a it's a busy time for
04:14 - students so I'm not that hopeful that
04:15 - we'll get them they're all taking their
04:17 - finals now and their students are
04:19 - graduating this weekend so may or may
04:24 - not happen I do have one student intern
04:27 - but he's working he and some of his
04:30 - classmates are working on a totally
04:32 - different section of the site so I
04:34 - they're already busy with that I don't
04:36 - want to add more to what they're doing
04:38 - okay
04:41 - Oh before we start so yeah I'm just
04:47 - gonna take another minute tell you all
04:48 - about one more thing and and that way we
04:51 - may get some more viewers here for some
04:52 - reason we're down lower lower than our
04:54 - normal count I'm not sure what happened
04:56 - with that but I just want to let you
05:01 - know let me get it up on the screen here
05:11 - and let me switch views okay so I want
05:17 - to let you know about JavaScript AF and
05:21 - I'll put I'll put the linked directly in
05:26 - the free code camp chat here so this is
05:33 - a project I'm not doing it for my main
05:35 - job at the University this is a side
05:38 - project that really a lot of you came up
05:41 - with the idea so just to give you a tiny
05:44 - overview of this a while back I had the
05:50 - idea to check to see if there were any
05:53 - dot AF domain names that might be worth
05:57 - buying and JavaScript AF was available
06:00 - so I bought it and then I asked on
06:02 - Twitter and on Instagram and I believe
06:06 - on the show what should I do with this a
06:08 - domain name now that I bought it and
06:11 - someone on Twitter I can't remember
06:13 - their name but I need to go back and
06:15 - look it up because they deserve a lot of
06:17 - the credit someone on Twitter said why
06:20 - don't you use it too and I'm
06:23 - paraphrasing here but to highlight
06:25 - different JavaScript projects that are
06:27 - really cool that are happening in the
06:29 - community and I thought that was a
06:32 - wonderful idea also had JavaScript her
06:35 - on Instagram saw it and had had some
06:38 - other ideas as well so we ended up at
06:41 - first combining all the ideas and it was
06:44 - this massive undertaking and then we
06:46 - decided to maybe split that up and break
06:49 - it down to its core so at its core it's
06:54 - a way to share awesome JavaScript
06:57 - repositories with each other and and to
07:00 - search for these cool JavaScript
07:03 - repositories so that's that's what it is
07:05 - maybe we'll have more features later on
07:08 - we'll just kind of see how it goes but
07:12 - anyway since this was kind of like born
07:15 - out of collaboration between you all
07:18 - know the whole community around this
07:19 - stream I thought it'd be cool to just
07:22 - bring it up explain that a little
07:24 - and let you all know that you could
07:27 - check it out you can log in with your
07:30 - github profile and add your own repos to
07:33 - this get some exposure for your
07:35 - repositories check out what some of the
07:37 - other people were doing and you can also
07:40 - go to the github page for this and
07:43 - contribute it's entirely open source so
07:46 - if you would like to be involved in the
07:47 - project you know please do so that would
07:52 - be that would be really awesome so we
07:54 - have a lot of open issues that at least
07:57 - we did have it I think we still do I
08:00 - haven't I haven't checked the issues yet
08:03 - today so here actually we do we do have
08:06 - some issues so let me copy and paste the
08:10 - repository link as well so that's the
08:13 - link repository on github and yeah so
08:19 - I'm gonna stop talking about that since
08:20 - that's not really the title of the video
08:22 - but just want to throw that out there
08:24 - and I really hope that this turns into
08:27 - something that is useful for the
08:29 - community so it's going to be a free
08:32 - thing if it starts getting big we're
08:35 - gonna try to work out some ways to pay
08:37 - for the servers and stuff right now I'm
08:38 - just paying for them video personally
08:42 - but for now at least it's entirely free
08:46 - I just wanted I just wanted to have be
08:49 - something cool for for you all for the
08:51 - whole community so anyway let's go on to
08:56 - see what we did yesterday trying to find
09:04 - English faculty what is wrong canonical
09:12 - class as a function
09:16 - what a great way to start the stream
09:18 - it's already broken what did I do
09:24 - let's restart the server I did pull down
09:32 - all the changes that we made yesterday
09:37 - and let's do a hard refresh
09:48 - all right well now let's let's check out
09:50 - the air then I guess so faculty list
09:53 - like to cannot call class as a function
09:58 - all right let's check it out
10:00 - faculty list j/s yeah that doesn't make
10:06 - any sense
10:07 - out
10:22 - No
10:28 - all right let's see what we're we're
10:32 - doing
10:36 - Oh also hey everybody I noticed a lot of
10:39 - you were saying hi in the end the chat
10:41 - let me let me start my Pomodoro timer
10:44 - and as soon as that finishes I'll go to
10:48 - the chat I'll check out your questions
10:49 - to answer as many as I can
10:54 - what's so for those of you who watch
10:59 - yesterday this definitely worked
11:01 - yesterday right so we had it working and
11:06 - now let me see actually let me take this
11:16 - I think this call is gonna be about the
11:18 - project so let me take this hello pretty
11:23 - good are you doing
11:26 - I could I could talk quickly is that
11:29 - okay okay mm-hm
11:49 - mm-hmm
11:58 - mmm-hmm
12:03 - mm-hmm
12:24 - okay yeah yeah for sure that's yeah we
12:28 - have some kind of bolder button styles
12:31 - that we have available so definitely I
12:35 - think I'm I'm gonna meet with with
12:37 - Steven later today yeah yeah okay yeah
12:45 - and the only the only reason about the
12:47 - San Damiano thing is on a previous site
12:50 - there was kind of a big deal about do we
12:53 - use the San Damiano cross in outline in
12:56 - such a way I think it was on my bullet
12:58 - points and the decision was made that no
13:03 - like we're not gonna use it as bullet
13:05 - points if we use it it'll be like the
13:07 - the image and not utilitarian any in any
13:11 - way so I figured I can't use it now even
13:15 - if we wanted to because you know the for
13:18 - the people that worked on the previous
13:19 - project that wanted to use it they would
13:21 - immediately if they saw I'd say well why
13:24 - couldn't we do it
13:32 - all right yeah Oh awesome thank you oh
13:39 - that's great I really appreciate that
13:42 - you too right all right so sorry about
13:50 - that I do I'd like to take calls during
13:53 - the stream because this is supposed to
13:54 - my my real work so especially if I know
13:58 - the call is gonna be about the project
14:00 - that we're working on I like to take it
14:02 - that way y'all can hear how I interact
14:04 - with other people at the office and I
14:08 - can give you a recap of what we just
14:09 - talked about so that was the director of
14:14 - missionary outreach so our students go
14:16 - on spring break and on various holidays
14:20 - our students go on mission trips to
14:23 - various poor communities throughout the
14:25 - United States and throughout the world
14:27 - and they'll do things like teach and
14:30 - take care of children at orphanages and
14:32 - help feed the poor and all different
14:36 - kinds of charitable activities so he
14:39 - organizes all of that and the section of
14:43 - the website that's gonna deal with that
14:45 - we have my intern and several other
14:47 - students are working on that section so
14:50 - I haven't talked directly with the
14:52 - director yet it's always been a
14:55 - go-between between the students meet
14:57 - with him and then the students meet with
14:59 - me so the director just called me to
15:01 - discuss one option about their his kind
15:05 - of idea for one section of the site and
15:08 - so basically the what it was is I had
15:12 - rejected that idea and it offered an
15:16 - alternate solution and he was happy with
15:18 - that and I was just explaining like why
15:21 - why we couldn't go with with that idea
15:23 - so I guess from that I just want to say
15:28 - like don't be afraid to be firm with
15:31 - your design principles that you're using
15:33 - and not compromise them and in this case
15:36 - there was no conflict it was here's why
15:40 - I don't want to do it like that here's
15:42 - an option that'll be good and
15:43 - and really he shared the reason why he
15:47 - wanted to do it like that and I think we
15:49 - could accomplish that same thing in a
15:51 - different way and I think it'd be even
15:53 - better a better user experience so he
15:57 - was fine with that
15:58 - and the call ended with him saying you
16:00 - know thank you for all your work the
16:01 - site looks awesome really excited about
16:04 - it
16:04 - so anyway doesn't always go that
16:07 - smoothly but you know it
16:11 - I guess just don't be afraid of
16:15 - potential conflicts you know over design
16:19 - especially designed user experience like
16:21 - if you know that what you want to do is
16:23 - the better way to go don't be afraid to
16:26 - stick up for it it may not even result
16:29 - in a conflict so I mean it's good to be
16:33 - flexible on things that really don't
16:35 - matter and then kind of save it for the
16:38 - things that do in this case this
16:40 - definitely did matter this was a
16:41 - decision they wanted to use the outline
16:45 - of the San Damiano crucifix which isn't
16:48 - it isn't our logo here but it's an image
16:50 - that's used frequently if you remember
16:53 - the catechetical Institute project we
16:54 - use that that image of the crucifix on
16:57 - on the homepage and they wanted to use
17:00 - the outline of it as a button to donate
17:02 - so it would essentially be the outline
17:04 - of that with the word donate in it and
17:06 - that would be a button and we had
17:07 - decided on a catechetical Institute
17:09 - project that we weren't going to
17:10 - instrumentalize the crucifix in that way
17:12 - being a sacred object for catholics and
17:16 - orthodox we didn't want to do that
17:19 - so i that was something that I
17:22 - definitely didn't want to budge on it
17:24 - was also something from a user
17:25 - experience standpoint that I thought
17:27 - would be confusing to users nowhere else
17:30 - on the site do we have a button that's
17:31 - designed like that at all I figured
17:34 - users probably wouldn't even realize
17:35 - that it was a button and was able to
17:38 - click on so it didn't have any precedent
17:41 - at all in anything we've done before or
17:43 - in material design and it would be
17:46 - confusing to the user so so for a lot of
17:50 - those reasons I had to be firm on that
17:52 - but anyway so sorry to go off on a
17:55 - little tangent
17:56 - those sorts of things I think are
17:58 - important to go over because you don't
18:00 - often get those in code tutorials that
18:02 - are just about the code but this job
18:04 - isn't always just about the code it's
18:06 - it's frequently about interaction with
18:08 - clients co-workers and things like that
18:11 - so having a product you can feel proud
18:15 - of sometimes isn't just about your skill
18:17 - as a coder you have to be able to
18:22 - influence others to accept decisions you
18:27 - make the right decisions so I've worked
18:30 - on projects before where it's at the end
18:33 - of the project I don't put my name on it
18:35 - there's no link to my website in the
18:37 - project because I couldn't be proud that
18:41 - the decisions that were made by the
18:43 - client I was not in agreement with
18:46 - so I did it but I'm not gonna say that's
18:51 - my website I wouldn't deny it if
18:53 - somebody asked but so anyway I just
18:57 - that's an important it's important skill
19:01 - that's often overlooked it's just not
19:02 - even thought of as as being a part of
19:06 - building something good but I really
19:08 - think it is on almost all of my projects
19:11 - it definitely would not have been as
19:13 - successful as it was if I had just gone
19:16 - along with whatever the people around me
19:18 - and above me suggested so especially if
19:22 - you're kind of in a position that I am
19:24 - where I'm one of the very few web
19:28 - developers that work here I have to
19:31 - remember like I I am the expert on this
19:34 - subject matter so while it might be
19:36 - someone higher up in the organization
19:39 - sometimes vice presidents of the
19:42 - organization they're giving their
19:44 - opinion but that's not their subject
19:46 - matter so very respectfully it's
19:49 - definitely up to me as the expert to say
19:53 - we're not I don't think we should do it
19:56 - that way here's why and unless the
20:00 - person is very egotistical then they're
20:03 - going to respect they're gonna respect
20:05 - that as long as you can give a good
20:07 - answer and usually I like to base it on
20:08 - data like
20:09 - you know the analytics show that if we
20:12 - do it this way we'll get more clicks
20:14 - more clicks equals more students more
20:16 - donors like then it goes well you know
20:20 - you got to know your stuff but anyway
20:22 - sorry
20:23 - enough of the sidetrack here I may have
20:26 - already used up my time I don't know
20:29 - what my timer is we're gonna go oh I'm
20:35 - still 15 minutes we'll keep this time
20:37 - we're going let's check out why this
20:41 - doesn't work maybe I'll check another
20:45 - let me check something else let's go
20:49 - with Fine Arts no it still doesn't work
20:57 - all right let's just try another pitcher
21:02 - so I'm pretty sure English has a page
21:09 - okay so that works
21:12 - it's just when I try to do faculty it's
21:17 - not working okay so obviously like this
21:23 - is giving me the line for the Distan
21:32 - like the bundled version is file which
21:34 - is not very helpful to me let's go can I
21:38 - go farther down and will it tell me
21:50 - you know let me just fine
22:12 - you know call class as a function
22:19 - you know I should check the live chat to
22:21 - see if any of you have any insight on
22:24 - the air Oh Frankie I see a lot of what
22:31 - you were saying about that it's helpful
22:32 - to hear what I was just talking about
22:34 - thank you for saying that I'm always not
22:36 - sure what's most helpful to you also I
22:38 - really appreciate that feedback
22:52 - okay I didn't look like anybody has any
22:55 - ideas yet sorry if I missed it
22:59 - all right so class cannot call class as
23:03 - a function so I don't think this is
23:08 - going to do anything but
23:33 - I'm really at a loss here you all were
23:37 - witnesses yesterday that this works who
23:40 - would we ended the stream yes hey what
23:43 - is different all right let me let me
23:45 - check to make sure the pool was
23:48 - successful so here's I did the get pool
23:54 - updating I faculty this side and that's
23:58 - what we worked on faculty the faculty
24:03 - list yes yeah I mean these look like the
24:07 - files that we work with yesterday it
24:10 - pulled down that code of conduct as well
24:13 - created that faculty this item J yes hmm
24:29 - I let's check out our faculty list item
24:32 - because I know the error is is saying
24:35 - it's in this page maybe but it maybe
24:39 - it's farther down and we're just not
24:41 - seeing it
24:50 - okay I should says try nuking node
24:54 - modules and re yarn oh good idea let's
24:57 - do that good idea I don't know why I
25:02 - always forget that hard [ __ ] this is
25:04 - like the second time this week you
25:05 - reminded me that that's a possible
25:08 - solution and hopefully it'll work
25:11 - alright so if you need to get rid of
25:13 - your node modules the easiest way I know
25:15 - of to do it is to RM RF the node modules
25:17 - do not do this command unless you are
25:21 - absolutely sure that you want to get rid
25:25 - of these files once you do this anything
25:28 - in the folder or any subfolders and any
25:30 - files in any of those folders will be
25:33 - gone and you cannot get them back they
25:35 - don't go in the trash they're gone okay
25:38 - so with that warning I'm about to do it
25:41 - so I'm gonna say RM and then given our
25:45 - RF flag and then I will say node modules
25:55 - so now let me turn the server off so
25:58 - doesn't freak out okay so if I try to go
26:04 - to let's say CD node modules it doesn't
26:09 - exist I'm trying to tab over there it's
26:10 - not Auto completing so it's gone now I'm
26:13 - gonna run yarn and it's gonna rebuild
26:16 - all those modules so for this machine
26:19 - it's probably not going to take that
26:20 - long if you have an older computer this
26:24 - may take longer if you have a non
26:27 - reliable internet connection probably
26:29 - not a good idea to do so just kind of a
26:35 - little a little warning if you need to
26:37 - get something done you might want to try
26:39 - a different method to fix it this is
26:42 - like I don't know for me this is like
26:45 - when something doesn't work on a Windows
26:47 - computer and you just reinstall windows
26:49 - like this it's like wow I don't really
26:52 - know what the problem is so let's just
26:54 - reset everything
27:00 - right while that's doing its thing I'll
27:04 - check out a few things in the live chat
27:06 - just some of the latest stuff that
27:09 - popped up Mme says hey long time no see
27:12 - how are you I'm doing pretty good how
27:15 - are you I'm glad to see you back in the
27:17 - in the chat whoa that was so fast that
27:24 - was less than a minute awesome okay so
27:29 - let's restart the server and see if it
27:33 - works for this particular project we use
27:36 - the command yarn dev may not be the same
27:41 - depending on what you're using for your
27:43 - project but for next J s projects dev is
27:48 - pretty standard alright it's refreshing
27:55 - it's refreshing refreshing no ah okay
28:03 - are we getting a different error it's no
28:07 - it's exactly the same error
28:08 - shoot I guess I ought to just read this
28:15 - it's kind of avoiding actually reading
28:18 - all of this but now maybe I'll read a
28:21 - little bit more and see if I can find
28:22 - out what what's happening
28:54 - all right that's that's not helping me
28:57 - at all I don't know if you all saw
29:00 - anything all right
29:09 - so let me see you check the network I
29:15 - want to see I'm gonna refresh this and
29:17 - see if if anything happened like did did
29:20 - an actual request get made
29:41 - nah whoops
29:52 - okay
29:57 - let's see John says I wonder if you may
30:03 - have placed your component as a child
30:05 - argument into another component if the
30:07 - child is a class it can't work if it is
30:11 - written as an argument all right
30:15 - I'm not I'm not exactly following that
30:20 - train of thought I don't know maybe John
30:27 - can you explain it to me maybe pretend
30:30 - maybe you don't have to pretend that
30:32 - much but pretend like I have no idea
30:33 - what I'm doing you explain it to me
30:35 - please
30:41 - all right you know what I didn't check
30:43 - out any of our other components that we
30:45 - change so let's do that now as well let
30:50 - me get rid of some of these
31:34 - my components of here faculty was that
31:46 - oh I should saw the error export see
31:51 - with stylus of parentheses you have open
31:53 - and close them
31:57 - okay cool
32:10 - I'm pretty sure this is what I I did in
32:14 - this work yesterday after I did this
32:28 - I thought I tried to do in a different
32:29 - way it didn't work then I looked up how
32:32 - we did it on in a different page what
32:38 - page was that was it the index
32:44 - no I doubt it was the index I mean it's
32:47 - worth looking at but yeah that's nothing
33:06 - I don't think it was the search fish
33:15 - proof
33:32 - I see
33:40 - okay ref ref all let me know if I
33:44 - mispronounce that but thank you for that
33:47 - so Rafal thinks it was majors or major
33:53 - yes awesome what a good memory thank you
33:57 - okay so here's how we did it oh okay all
34:02 - right so I it looks like I did do it
34:06 - wrong so let's check so we have one open
34:08 - front the second one here one open one
34:15 - open and and I shouldn't have it I
34:18 - shouldn't have closed it I should have
34:25 - closed it there I should have closed it
34:28 - here
34:37 - that's really odd I mean I thought it
34:39 - worked I I don't know I don't know what
34:44 - happened unless I somehow have my
34:46 - editors set differently with Auto
34:49 - formatting and it messed it up I don't I
34:53 - don't know I mean I guess we'll find out
34:56 - if we if we try to commit this and it
34:59 - formats it weird but I don't know it
35:03 - doesn't make sense
35:04 - anyway this works so everybody that that
35:07 - caught that thank you so much all right
35:14 - Wow and we're almost the end the
35:17 - Pomodoro session so I'm just gonna start
35:21 - answering questions take a five-minute
35:23 - break answer questions that'll be good
35:25 - cuz I can relax my brain for a second
35:27 - from trying to figure out that error and
35:30 - I just realized I don't have my light on
35:33 - there we go
35:38 - when we come back then we'll come back
35:41 - to this and start doing what I had hoped
35:44 - we would be doing but that's that's cool
35:47 - that happens that's because that's life
35:53 - that's how it happens sometimes so I'm
35:58 - really glad that I decided to work on
36:01 - this during the stream today because you
36:05 - you all were very very big help and
36:07 - potentially save me a lot of time
36:10 - alright let's start this whoops
36:14 - short break I'm scrolling all the way up
36:16 - to the top and I'm just gonna work my
36:17 - way down through as many questions as I
36:19 - can and anything I don't get now I'll
36:21 - get after the next Pomodoro session
36:43 - okay Christian asked if I still use the
36:46 - dev Franciscan dot University yes let me
36:49 - let me put that in there dev all right
36:57 - so I just put that in the live chat if
36:58 - you want to check out this site the
37:00 - development version go to dev da
37:01 - Franciscan University at some point
37:05 - today if I can remember I'd like to
37:08 - update that with the latest changes so
37:11 - right now it's it's a like maybe a week
37:13 - behind in terms of what we've been doing
37:15 - on the stream so I'd like to update it
37:18 - soon thanks for reminding me about that
37:26 - Christian
37:34 - Frankie says greetings as how you don't
37:36 - want hope all as well not bad I'm
37:39 - feeling really happy today actually I
37:45 - mentioned last week or so that I was
37:49 - going on a diet and exercising and so
37:51 - far I felt I felt a lot better
37:54 - definitely more energy in the morning
37:56 - I've lost seven pounds so I mean it's
38:02 - it's it seems like it's going really
38:04 - well
38:04 - and I don't know I mean you know
38:08 - everybody always says if you eat healthy
38:10 - and you exercise you'll feel better and
38:13 - I always hope that they were wrong
38:15 - because I'd like to eat donuts all the
38:17 - time and and I don't know like just I'd
38:22 - like to eat anything I want to eat right
38:24 - but over the last two weeks it's
38:28 - definitely been my experience that I do
38:31 - feel a lot better so unfortunately it is
38:34 - true if you want to feel good and have
38:36 - energy you gotta exercise and eat right
38:40 - that makes me so sad but it's true
38:54 - yeah-ha-ha I just read her should have a
38:57 - comment in here it's let's see what
38:59 - we've done yesterday then good old next
39:01 - yes error page maybe laugh at I'm I'm
39:03 - glad that it made you laugh
39:07 - yeah that's outer eyes just how it is
39:11 - sometimes
39:12 - [Music]
39:16 - jayson's notice it's a hard line the
39:19 - phone yeah so the phone in my office is
39:23 - actually connected with the cord they
39:26 - still exist
39:27 - anybody who's really young and watching
39:30 - this this is how all phones were at one
39:33 - time when I was little I remember we had
39:37 - a really long cord so that my mom could
39:40 - walk all the way around the house and do
39:42 - stuff and still be on the phone so yeah
39:48 - so those are the folks that we have sure
39:58 - sure ah sorry if I'm pronouncing that
40:01 - wrong Shura says what are all the live
40:04 - streams that free cocaine does I do most
40:08 - of the live streams occasionally we do
40:10 - have some other people live stream as
40:12 - well I think Ethan Arrowwood did some
40:14 - live streams he hasn't done one in a
40:17 - while though so I'm not sure if he's
40:19 - planning on doing anymore or not
40:22 - so yes pretty much I I believe it's
40:27 - pretty much just me and most of our
40:28 - other videos are pre-recorded at this
40:31 - point so unfortunately it's just me so
40:36 - if you if you don't like my style I
40:38 - guess there's not another option for you
40:40 - right now but if you'd be interested in
40:41 - doing something like this for free code
40:43 - camp reach out to beau Carnes or Quincy
40:47 - and you know propose something you might
40:50 - be able to do some streams as well or
40:54 - videos ronan says hello hey Ronin how's
41:00 - it going thanks for watching
41:22 - Frankie I'm just seeing all your
41:24 - messages when I was talking about the
41:26 - phone call that I had thank you so much
41:29 - for all the encouragement I don't know
41:33 - if you realize how much that that helps
41:35 - me and motivates me to keep going and
41:38 - just I mean honestly just makes me feel
41:40 - really good so thank you so much I
41:42 - appreciate that
41:53 - okay so my times up I want to write down
41:57 - where I'm leaving off in the chat so I
42:00 - can go right back to it afterwards okay
42:09 - I've written that down and let's see let
42:19 - me start this wonderful now I can tell
42:23 - you what I was going to tell you at the
42:26 - very beginning of the stream it's taking
42:29 - me a bit longer than I thought but
42:31 - here's the page we're going to be
42:33 - working on we want to make it look nicer
42:35 - here's the data that I really want to be
42:37 - here I want an image of these particular
42:43 - faculty members and I also want their
42:46 - title I want that to be like the minimum
42:50 - data that we display at some point later
42:53 - on maybe we'll display more but right
42:55 - now I think that's bare minimum because
42:57 - that's what's already on the website the
43:01 - the current website that we'll be
43:02 - replacing so let's let's get to it we
43:12 - need to we need to see the data first to
43:16 - figure out how we're gonna get it so let
43:18 - me go into WordPress and log in and
43:24 - we'll go to faculty and we'll pick I
43:29 - guess I'll go in here to classics I'll
43:34 - go to uh Sarah where because she's a
43:36 - really cool person and I know her my
43:40 - wife knows her a lot better than I do
43:42 - but I saw her when I was in the back of
43:48 - church with my kids one Sunday cuz the
43:51 - baby was making a fuss
43:53 - she had her newborn baby back there and
43:55 - she was super nice so I'm gonna feature
43:57 - her today
44:04 - we want to get this and it's inside a
44:10 - title tag which is great because we
44:15 - should be able also awesome I am super
44:20 - happy about this so we can focus on
44:25 - finding this title tag and then get the
44:29 - data out of here and use that as the
44:33 - title I just glanced at the chat and so
44:38 - Frankie ass is is your wife a coder she
44:42 - is so she actually did teach in the
44:44 - English department which I was just
44:46 - showing she was an adjunct so she didn't
44:48 - show up on the website but she taught
44:54 - there she just taught her last class
44:55 - last week and now she is learning to
44:58 - code she's been learning for a few
45:00 - months and she was with me at the Google
45:03 - i/o conference just the extension
45:06 - conference in Pittsburgh and she's she
45:09 - works now for moms can code which is a
45:12 - nonprofit to help moms learn how to code
45:14 - so she's teaching a course on blockchain
45:16 - development with solidity so really cool
45:22 - she really likes it so far of course
45:24 - I've been encouraging and and we were up
45:26 - before the kids got up this morning
45:27 - working on code and so that's been fun
45:33 - and she actually has a blog too so it's
45:38 - it's on github I should I should link it
45:43 - after somebody remind me after this
45:45 - Pomodoro session is over and I'll paste
45:47 - in the link to my wife's blog because
45:50 - she blogs about coding related stuff and
45:55 - she built her own blog as well so we can
45:59 - get title where's there's the image that
46:04 - we want okay so we have two different
46:07 - images one is supposed to be a smaller
46:09 - image and the other one is supposed to
46:11 - be a larger image assuming that they
46:14 - were all put in correctly
46:16 - into the old system which I don't know
46:19 - if they were or not actually we we could
46:28 - probably grab this entire image tag so
46:35 - we could just say anything that's inside
46:37 - this list view image we can grab the
46:40 - whole thing we'll see if this image
46:43 - works if it's too small then we'll grab
46:46 - this detail view image okay let's see
47:04 - all right so I this is actually doable I
47:07 - was worried that it would be really hard
47:08 - but this seems doable I do want to check
47:11 - I think we have some code and other
47:13 - components that can help us get a jump
47:15 - start on this so let's find what
47:16 - component already has some of this stuff
47:18 - in here and then we'll we'll try to use
47:22 - that so I'm gonna leave this up on this
47:24 - screen but jump over here quickly what
47:28 - screen is it you know what maybe it's
47:32 - the profile
47:34 - oh no that's where's the should be
47:38 - faculty is a faculty okay there we are
47:47 - so you can see in this page we're doing
47:51 - some searching for for content hmm and
48:02 - in this case we are removing removing
48:08 - things and putting in okay so actually
48:14 - we ought to keep
48:22 - okay we got to keep some of this
48:33 - countenance retirees
48:37 - hmm
48:41 - all right well let's just let's start
48:43 - into it and see see how far we can get
48:46 - so in our we'll do this in our faculty
48:52 - list should we are we passing in content
49:00 - factor this item profiling profile link
49:08 - content okay we can pass in content I
49:12 - guess we'll do it here in this component
49:15 - I think that makes more sense to do it
49:19 - here okay so let's make sure we pass in
49:27 - the content and
49:45 - content
49:48 - okay let's save that
49:54 - uh-huh Aniki noticed again that I have
49:58 - this global X content which was just in
50:02 - there for testing and I keep forgetting
50:04 - to remove it everywhere so good catch on
50:07 - that like I don't I see it and it just
50:10 - doesn't occur to me at all to take it
50:12 - out I don't know what's wrong with my
50:13 - brain it's just it's it's like it's it's
50:16 - not even there
50:18 - okay all right so now we're done with
50:22 - this and then we're going to be working
50:25 - here in our faculty list item component
50:28 - by the way if I haven't said it already
50:31 - all of this code that we're working with
50:32 - is available on github the links in the
50:35 - description it's all open source feel
50:37 - free to use any of it for any purpose
50:39 - you want I mean try not to use it for
50:40 - anything bad but I really can't stop you
50:42 - okay so what we want to do then is take
50:51 - the content and we're gonna manipulate
51:00 - it to get what we want from it so we're
51:05 - not exactly going to do it like this
51:07 - where we create a constant called
51:08 - content we're gonna split it up because
51:11 - we're basically going to want image and
51:15 - then we'll want a constant called title
51:20 - and we'll split it up like that so you
51:28 - know what let's just copy
51:29 - listen let's copy a bunch of this stuff
51:31 - here and in the context of faculty j/s
51:35 - this is this is in a different place
51:38 - than we're gonna put it here because
51:41 - we're doing different things this is
51:42 - inside a query component so this is a
51:45 - little bit different so let's see what
51:49 - we can put this
51:55 - I believe we can put it right here and
51:59 - that would be a decent spot for it so
52:03 - let's just say let's call this one image
52:11 - and let's call this one title and here
52:24 - we can take out all of this stuff and
52:27 - just say content and we can also do that
52:34 - here so let's take this we're getting
52:41 - these red lines here because we haven't
52:44 - used it yet so it's it's fine once we
52:46 - use it down here and our component it
52:47 - should work so let's see what's
52:50 - happening this replaced details we can
52:52 - get rid of that but before I completely
52:54 - take it out I'd like to see if we could
52:56 - just adjust it to do what we want so
52:59 - let's go back and look so basically what
53:02 - this is doing is finding the tag called
53:04 - details and then replacing it with a
53:06 - different tag so I don't think that
53:11 - that's really what we want to do here so
53:18 - we're not gonna do that now you know
53:21 - what let me let's let's check out an
53:24 - article on MDN why it should be sort of
53:30 - this JavaScript I don't remember exactly
53:36 - what this returns when we do search but
53:41 - this might be what we want if we notice
53:44 - with us in the sky
53:46 - the index to the first match between the
53:48 - regular expression and they give a
53:51 - string if not found on okay so it will
53:55 - return weight will turn the index of the
54:00 - first match I don't really want the
54:02 - index what I want testaments shame or
54:08 - information with sufficient use of a
54:09 - match returns for yeah I don't want the
54:15 - index okay so let's check match and
54:22 - let's see I'm just checking the chat
54:26 - really quickly usually if I'm heading
54:30 - down the wrong path in my research then
54:32 - you all let me know so that's who I
54:33 - wanted to double-check I see a lot going
54:37 - on in the chat so that's awesome I can't
54:39 - wait to to check it out after this
54:41 - Pomodoro session I clicked the wrong
54:43 - thing okay if you're not familiar with
54:46 - mdn it's the Mozilla developer Network
54:49 - and it's always like maybe the first or
54:52 - second thing that comes up in a google
54:54 - chat when you look up JavaScript stuff
54:56 - and other stuff too but I find it to be
55:02 - one of the best resources if you really
55:04 - want to get to know what certain thing
55:06 - does alright so this will return the
55:11 - string match deficient we're turning an
55:13 - array containing the entire match string
55:15 - as the first element followed by any
55:18 - results captured in parentheses if there
55:23 - were no matches null is returned okay
55:35 - let's see the examples alright so here
55:46 - they've they made a variable called
55:48 - fountain and that equals string here so
55:50 - this string and then they've matched it
55:52 - with this regular expression so the log
55:58 - shows string which is C chapter okay
56:06 - actually I sent you for more information
56:14 - okay
56:27 - all right I think this will work so if
56:30 - anybody knows of a better method to use
56:32 - maybe something more performant I'm open
56:35 - to that as well but for now I think
56:36 - we're going to use this and this this
56:39 - should work okay so let's see a non
56:44 - rigid object all right so let's grab all
56:54 - right
56:55 - oops wrong way here we go so let's get
57:01 - rid of this I want to keep the replace
57:06 - though so we're gonna do dot match and
57:12 - what we want to match is let's see let
57:21 - me look back here I'm not I don't have
57:25 - regular expression stuff you know all
57:27 - memorized so I always have to look it up
57:33 - so let's go with what is this supposed
57:38 - to be image detail I need to look at
57:48 - what this was I can't remember what it
57:50 - was exactly
57:52 - okay so I'll list view image that's what
57:56 - we were gonna use
58:06 - all right so ListView image and let's
58:10 - see we want to end
58:29 - anybody good with regular expressions
58:31 - help me out here let me explain what I
58:32 - want and then help me out if you can
58:35 - otherwise I'm gonna have to look up the
58:36 - correct syntax here which is okay I'm
58:39 - not complaining about that but I just
58:43 - want to use you all as resources if I
58:45 - can so what I'd like to do is let me go
58:49 - back to here to visa so I'd like to get
58:52 - all the data that is between this
58:55 - opening ListView image tag and this
58:58 - closing ListView image tag so that's
59:03 - what I'd like to do let's see
59:21 - drinks every are so I said read reg reg
59:27 - X which is for from regular expression
59:29 - fine string between two strings Menace
59:32 - over to match all characters between two
59:34 - strings let's see
59:37 - extract string area extract string
59:40 - between two strings that's what we want
59:42 - okay
59:51 - No look behind is not supported in
59:54 - JavaScript am I not gonna be able to use
59:59 - this then
60:12 - let's see Michael says this is what I
60:17 - was going to play around with yesterday
60:18 - I thought you're gonna get the intern to
60:19 - do it
60:20 - Oh what I was gonna do with the intern
60:22 - is I was going to get the intern to
60:24 - manually edit the data so that we didn't
60:27 - have to do this so but then I decided
60:30 - well like number one I don't really the
60:32 - intern is working on other stuff and
60:35 - then number two it would probably be
60:39 - better if I just do this because most
60:41 - likely have to apply it to other cases
60:44 - as well all right so I need to try to
60:48 - make sense of this matches a percent
60:57 - character okay so this is a look behind
61:11 - okay
61:24 - maybe won't be able to use this because
61:26 - this isn't supported in JavaScript they
61:29 - have to find another one I'll leave it
61:30 - up just in case but let's see it so much
61:36 - every character between this is a sent
61:38 - in synthesized it's still it's using the
61:47 - look behind included fuse cases
62:22 - hmm
62:24 - all right let's try
62:33 - let's try this
62:48 - okay yeah this show that
62:59 - oh okay John says if you use style
63:03 - components you can bring in the whole
63:05 - string you set a Const for your element
63:09 - name which is the element and nest the
63:13 - image in the CSS styling this can all be
63:16 - wrapped and material huh that's
63:21 - interstate hmm skewed all right let's
63:30 - let me throw this in quickly and then I
63:41 - will need
63:49 - you look at the end in I can't use you
63:56 - use this to escape this ring
64:18 - this team image
64:28 - it's an expression
64:43 - we'll see some stuff
64:53 - all right I saw some stuff pop up in the
64:55 - chat I wondered if it was about this but
64:57 - looks like our [ __ ] just came back so
65:00 - welcome back our [ __ ]
65:17 - what am I missing
65:23 - initiation
65:37 - let me check that mdn see what that one
65:46 - alright said they have all I regular the
65:49 - regular expressions as separate
65:51 - variables I mean I guess I could try it
66:01 - like that if that's
66:09 - I said I want it I check again
66:22 - okay
67:03 - again
67:21 - Oh
67:26 - I don't know what I was thinking I could
67:29 - probably move this back in here actually
67:30 - let me put it back in you
67:36 - oops I mean back in here Wow why can't i
67:42 - okay I do this right here
67:46 - wait a second oh I I highlighted
67:49 - everything there we go
67:55 - okay all right so what I'm doing then
68:04 - and now I do I want to replace or I want
68:11 - to add in Franciscan dotty to you for
68:13 - now and let's throw in image
68:46 - i order that the invalid regular
68:51 - expression let's so let's do another
68:59 - break I'll go back answer some more
69:01 - questions and then we'll work on this
69:06 - there's something wrong with my regular
69:08 - expression syntax so I think as soon as
69:11 - we figure that out it should work so may
69:16 - not need a whole nother Pomodoro session
69:18 - for that okay so I'm going to go back up
69:29 - to where I left off
69:30 - in the live chat and answering questions
69:46 - Aurra or era I'm not sure how to
69:48 - pronounce this ara it says what editor
69:51 - is this it's Visual Studio code
70:03 - okay himemiya says earlier I asked the
70:06 - many how he was no one in then I didn't
70:07 - get a chance to read their Swan [ __ ] so
70:09 - the responses says thanks I want to say
70:12 - that lately I have been accepted in a
70:14 - Google Africa scholarship for mobile web
70:17 - specialists at Udacity if you can tell
70:21 - us your option about these online
70:23 - certificates oh yeah for sure
70:26 - I think the Udacity courses are great
70:29 - you learn a lot in terms of the actual
70:31 - certificate and its value it's entirely
70:34 - dependent on a company and what the
70:36 - company thinks so if a company has
70:39 - already hired people from Udacity they
70:43 - will probably depending on how those
70:46 - employees worked out they will probably
70:48 - have a higher opinion of a nano degree
70:50 - certificate from Udacity otherwise you
70:56 - just you never know no one at the
70:58 - company may have heard of Udacity before
71:00 - and you know maybe they're skeptical of
71:05 - it so it's not a guarantee at every
71:11 - company but you can check out a company
71:13 - on LinkedIn and it should tell you you
71:19 - should be able to see how many people
71:22 - went to Udacity so I think if you have
71:25 - Udacity listed as a school in your
71:27 - LinkedIn profile when you look at
71:30 - companies profiles or at least their job
71:34 - listings it should tell you how many
71:36 - other people from Udacity got hired and
71:39 - work at that company now it's imperfect
71:41 - measurement because there could be
71:44 - people from Udacity that work at that
71:45 - company that don't have get up profiles
71:48 - so you you may not get 100% accurate
71:52 - results but that should at least let you
71:53 - know like the company hired ten people
71:56 - from Udacity you know maybe they know
72:00 - what's up you know that Udacity is a
72:02 - good place to work but my feelings are
72:06 - about it or like you you learn a lot if
72:09 - you're the type of person that does well
72:11 - when an hour
72:12 - with our deadlines and structure I think
72:17 - it's a great great way to learn you know
72:21 - the cause if you have a scholarship it's
72:22 - great because to me the only downside to
72:24 - Udacity is is paying for it when there
72:28 - are so many great free resources out
72:29 - there it's really hard to commit to
72:31 - paying for a program so I think the
72:36 - scholarship thing is wonderful my wife's
72:38 - working through the front-end nanodegree
72:40 - right now she also got a scholarship so
72:43 - and I did the react nano degree I didn't
72:46 - get a scholarship I just paid for it but
72:51 - yeah so I I definitely do recommend it
72:55 - assuming that it works within your
72:58 - budget and your financial situation
73:12 - hater says what is the best way to
73:14 - handle media queries with react that is
73:16 - a great question
73:17 - let's take a look quickly at how we
73:21 - handle it here so in in particular we
73:25 - can go in the component right we we have
73:29 - media queries here well if you're using
73:34 - a framework like material UI they may
73:36 - have ways to do media queries so
73:40 - materialise way to handle media queries
73:42 - here is they have these break points or
73:47 - we can do theme break points and then up
73:49 - and it you know extra large screen so
73:52 - basically this allows us to mimic the
73:54 - functionality of media queries when
73:57 - using CSS in within our component also
74:01 - you could just make a regular CSS file
74:04 - use media queries as you normally would
74:06 - and then pull it into the file which
74:08 - we're not doing here are we doing it yep
74:13 - we're doing it here so you can see we
74:16 - are pulling in a regular CSS file into
74:20 - our component and in this manner as well
74:23 - so and these aren't the only ways to do
74:28 - it there are a ton of different ways to
74:29 - do CSS within JavaScript for react so
74:33 - these are just two ways that we happen
74:36 - to be doing it on this project so
74:39 - they're you know I'm sure if you if you
74:41 - search for to talk to other people
74:43 - you'll find a lot of other ways to do it
74:45 - as well so my timer is up for now so
74:50 - we're gonna do one more Pomodoro session
74:52 - I'd say no matter what this is gonna be
74:56 - our final Pomodoro session so whether or
74:58 - not I get this to work we'll just we'll
75:00 - just end it then because it's it starts
75:03 - to be a really long stream and I'm sure
75:06 - it's okay for you all you could all
75:10 - could handle it at least you can handle
75:11 - the code I don't know if you had me
75:12 - talking that long but it starts to get
75:15 - really tiring for me and my brain just
75:17 - gives like too much so I know I'm gonna
75:20 - be no good after another Pomodoro
75:22 - session
75:23 - of streaming
75:37 - all right so let's start up our timer
75:40 - for one more Pomodoro session and now
75:46 - let's let's check out a regular
75:47 - expression see what I messed up with
75:50 - this and figure out what I need to do so
75:52 - I'm gonna copy this regular expression
75:54 - over to one of these services that lets
75:58 - you test your regular expressions let's
76:02 - see let me see if I can just get a new
76:11 - one well what's that one somebody put in
76:17 - a latch at the URL to another one good I
76:21 - think I've used that other one regex
76:28 - 101.com
76:29 - let's try that one
76:37 - nope not brazier is eggs
76:47 - All Right see here's our regular
76:49 - expression and then let's let's pull in
76:53 - let's bring in our data to test with and
77:04 - it matched what what the heck it words
77:09 - what is going on alright so which part
77:18 - let me let me go check this error
77:20 - message again
77:49 - Oh Phoenix just got here said there's no
77:53 - notification for the stream I don't know
77:56 - what happened with that I'm really sorry
77:57 - you didn't get a notification I started
77:59 - in early this morning I scheduled it so
78:01 - that I was hoping all the notifications
78:03 - would go out so really sorry about that
78:15 - let's see I'll use an explanation
78:21 - alright so the first part matches the
78:24 - character list view image literally
78:26 - case-sensitive which is what we want
78:28 - this question as matches the remainder
78:30 - of the pattern with the following
78:32 - effective flag s modifier use single
78:35 - line dot matches new line characters
78:38 - first capture group matches any
78:41 - character quantifier matches between
78:44 - zero and unlimited times as many times
78:46 - as possible okay this matches the
78:50 - character literally case sensitive case
78:55 - sensitive list image you literally could
78:59 - sense it okay Group one match okay
79:16 - John Hanson says JavaScript flavor oh
79:19 - okay good that was that was a very good
79:28 - idea there I was not using the
79:31 - JavaScript style of regex so I can't use
79:37 - this question mark hmm all right well
79:49 - let's change machine C strings DDoS good
80:09 - I just read is up
80:19 - all right so the look ahead doesn't work
80:23 - so you want to capture him at you cow
80:26 - for change to capture your Shima cash
80:29 - inside the parentheses okay let's try
80:34 - this
80:44 - well that was easy okay okay let's see
81:00 - what happens now cannot reap any match
81:06 - of undefined hmm all right what am i
81:16 - doing probably shouldn't be now that's
81:22 - not what I want that's when they didn't
81:24 - work
81:55 - Oh hold on a second match I need to do
82:05 - should work shrink up match there should
82:08 - be content match and then okay
82:28 - sit sing can't reprimand fine
82:39 - saying content is undefined
82:58 - all right let's try like that
83:41 - let me see
83:53 - let me make sure faculty lists are we
83:57 - passing in so we are passing content
84:01 - let's make sure
84:24 - it is zero known faculty edges
84:43 - it's
85:13 - I want to see what the data structures
85:18 - that we're getting in here so let's go
85:22 - in dev tools and I'll make this bigger
85:29 - and let's go into reader now I'm not
85:36 - using Redux so not have
85:44 - I thought I had Apollo dev tools hooked
85:49 - up here but I guess not
87:08 - trying to find where content is there we
87:21 - go Michael
87:22 - you're you thinking the same thing as
87:24 - I'm sorry I haven't been I've been quiet
87:27 - what I'm thinking is the we're not
87:31 - actually getting the correct data so our
87:34 - regular expression and our match our dot
87:37 - match can't work because there's nothing
87:38 - there for it to work on so I want to
87:45 - figure out what the data structure is I
87:47 - was hoping I could easily find it here I
87:50 - was actually hoping that I had Apollo
87:51 - dev tools I don't know why I don't have
87:55 - it and I can't find where the data is
88:10 - I guess I could let me go within the
88:12 - component and see
88:33 - okay so there's nothing so this content
88:42 - faculty node content said that this is
88:45 - not being cast down as a prop so we get
88:48 - the profile link profile name but
88:51 - nothing is here so I think yeah there's
88:56 - there's a problem there so in a page
89:03 - where we are using the content data this
89:11 - props data type edges zero that's the
89:16 - content so it's not listed so that's
89:20 - that's the problem so up here we have
89:27 - snowed faculty edges
89:36 - zero all right so let's let's say I put
89:41 - edges zero here hopefully it won't mess
89:43 - everything up but let's see if this
89:45 - would make a difference
89:56 - faculty data dot map is not a function
90:02 - okay so that's it's not working there
90:22 - I guess I could just look it up here as
90:25 - I said this extension alright so am I'm
90:36 - not actually getting the content haha
90:42 - alright let's double check this ha ha
90:47 - I'm not bringing in that piece of data
90:50 - that's what it doesn't exist
90:56 - alright okay then let's let's look at
91:07 - exactly how I brought this in here I I
91:14 - titled slow content okay great
91:30 - okay
91:37 - and then down here hey there's our
91:47 - content lots of it
91:51 - hi let's take this and we'll say no
91:59 - definitely do not want the content there
92:01 - what I want there is the title and let's
92:18 - I wonder if I still need that let's
92:20 - let's try that the place is not a
92:28 - function Shh
92:44 - he's replacing on a function
92:53 - see if I can do it this way
93:03 - okay so that did work actually so we
93:06 - could see where the content is it's
93:09 - replaced and added this franciscan dot
93:11 - e-d-u which is wonderful now let's let's
93:15 - go in here and put our image in see if
93:19 - that works and our title is still giving
93:23 - us of course everything so let's do a
93:26 - match let's get rid of all of this and
93:32 - let's match for title yay check that out
93:46 - okay so we have this professor share of
93:48 - English okay works but you know we
93:55 - actually don't want a title tag in the
93:57 - middle of our HTML right because saito
94:00 - tags have a meaning in HTML we don't
94:03 - want it to be that so let's let's grab
94:09 - this and let's add this here and first
94:20 - we're gonna replace title
94:31 - so what we'll do is instead of just
94:34 - having title tags we're going to take
94:38 - out the type of tags replace them with
94:40 - div tags and then put in the class of
94:43 - title and then
94:57 - let's see I guess I'll have to change
95:02 - this up
95:11 - let's see if I can switch it didn't let
95:14 - me switch the order but let's see if we
95:16 - can switch the order this time let's see
95:19 - what's going on with this lists you
95:21 - image probably what's happening here is
95:27 - I see
95:41 - yeah let's just put in a div and we'll
95:56 - just say actually let's do this
96:23 - image
96:45 - No okay I said you need to do this
96:51 - differently just put this here and then
97:00 - let's let's take this and make this what
97:04 - we need to match and with this let's
97:18 - just switch that to death so you know
97:30 - alright cool we have images whoa we have
97:35 - different sized images alright see so I
97:39 - I had mentioned I that the images had to
97:44 - be input correctly so obviously there
97:46 - are different sized images here so let's
97:48 - change it up and use the large size
97:50 - image for everyone since this is amazing
97:55 - all also we need to change how we input
97:59 - this this title so let's use detail view
98:07 - image instead so instead of ListView
98:15 - image we use detailed view image and
98:23 - then with our title we want to add in a
98:31 - dangerously set in our HTML in here in
98:38 - our typography
98:47 - we can do that I don't know if I've ever
98:49 - tried to do that in a typography
98:52 - component let's see see if we can do it
98:59 - what what what what what did we just do
99:04 - okay
99:07 - evidently I messed something up oh yeah
99:13 - I put content instead of title there we
99:17 - go
99:25 - Wow what what is happening what did I do
99:55 - let's see
100:19 - okay so that's detail view image there
100:23 - should be only one
100:45 - all right
100:47 - what I'm doing is getting displayed
100:50 - twice okay this isn't anything what is
100:55 - happening all right what if I what am i
101:00 - doing that displays this twice
102:14 - I did something wrong what did I do
102:37 - hmmm not exactly sure what I did I
102:42 - wasn't getting devil images before
102:45 - somehow I'm getting them now
102:56 - not sure what changed
103:06 - what cheese
103:18 - I don't know I can't see it
103:29 - Michael s why does that one image have a
103:32 - details list image tag in dev tools yeah
103:36 - I don't understand
103:42 - just one has it it's the same image
104:12 - and then it's there's a comma in between
104:16 - here and a comma in between these as
104:20 - well so we have the div with the class
104:26 - professor of English and then we
104:28 - actually have professor English at the
104:30 - end oh I see what's happening okay okay
104:38 - all right here's what we need to do
104:41 - match see image is
105:03 - all right let's see that yeah there we
105:09 - go
105:13 - still Wow these images are I might have
105:26 - to change my we might have to change
105:32 - this layout like I can't like the size
105:40 - of these images are 200 by 300 pixels
105:45 - and this is the details view which means
105:51 - they're the bigger image so if all I get
105:55 - is 2 by 3 I have 200 pixels wide we may
106:02 - need to go back to a list view or at
106:05 - least we got to change this I'm not
106:13 - gonna do it right now in today's stream
106:15 - but we got to work with the images that
106:18 - we have and right now we have small
106:21 - images so if this is the images we have
106:25 - to work with and we need to adjust our
106:28 - cards we obviously can't shrink the card
106:31 - all the way down to this image there
106:33 - wouldn't be enough room for the text
106:35 - that way it would look really weird
106:36 - right we I don't want to have stuff on a
106:38 - bunch of different lines it would be
106:40 - okay for this section I suppose but I
106:42 - don't want the titles going on two
106:44 - different lines so I mean I guess I
106:49 - could let's just try it let's try it and
106:53 - then I don't think I would like it
106:55 - though so where's our cards
107:05 - I'm gonna fix all right let's just say
107:08 - max width is 200 pixels okay so that
107:18 - shrinks all our cards down I mean what
107:22 - do you all think like a card this size I
107:28 - don't know about it I mean I could maybe
107:31 - try to reduce the padding it would be a
107:34 - little better you know and then maybe go
107:37 - one two three four like four across so
107:44 - would it be better to do that it would
107:45 - be better to have basically rows with
107:48 - the image name title link and then the
107:54 - image is here I'll let you all have some
108:00 - time to let me know what you think about
108:03 - that idea and right now I'm gonna scroll
108:07 - back up to where I left off in the in
108:10 - the chat I'm gonna answer some questions
108:13 - and then once I get down to the bottom
108:14 - out I'll see what you all think about
108:16 - that that'll determine what I do next
108:18 - with these with these cards and then I
108:23 - will I'm not gonna change it right now
108:25 - I'll commit this and then once I'm done
108:28 - streaming maybe I'll get something to
108:30 - eat because my stomachs growling sorry
108:32 - if you all heard that hum and then I
108:35 - need to get back to you data transfer so
108:37 - I'll be doing that the rest of the day
108:46 - okay so
108:57 - Phoenix is Oh No
109:00 - I'm a whole hour ahead of the live chat
109:02 - let me show that this dream has been
109:06 - we're coming up on two hours Wow since
109:14 - the stream is going on so long I'm gonna
109:16 - try to just read the questions maybe a
109:19 - comment or two of course I will look at
109:23 - them all I'm just not gonna read them
109:25 - all out loud just to save a bit of time
109:32 - John Henson says do you get some or
109:35 - maybe too many unresolved coding
109:37 - problems haunting you to try to sleep at
109:38 - night coding seems to embed itself in
109:40 - one's gray matter yeah it depends so if
109:46 - I do if I have a problem that I can't
109:49 - figure out and I've worked on it for a
109:50 - really long time I still didn't figure
109:52 - it out it does bother me especially if I
109:56 - like I'm out of ideas occasionally I
109:59 - will code in my sleep sometimes I come
110:04 - up with good ideas from my sleep coding
110:07 - and I mean like I dream about coding I
110:10 - don't actually get up and start coding
110:12 - so sometimes in my dreams I figure out
110:15 - something sometimes it actually works if
110:17 - I try it when I'm awake yeah but lately
110:21 - I've been I've been okay I haven't
110:23 - really been worrying too much about any
110:27 - code
110:35 - Matthew says do you have to use
110:37 - metaprogramming at all things like
110:39 - symbols proxies and reflection no I
110:43 - don't and I haven't really heard that
110:44 - much about it so I don't know what I'm
110:49 - kind of interested to know more about it
110:51 - though but I don't use it
111:08 - let's see
111:11 - Christian says well if you keep this up
111:14 - with a healthy eating you will find out
111:16 - eating sweets is not that tasty yeah I
111:21 - long time ago before I was married maybe
111:25 - like 1314 years ago I was on a diet
111:30 - where I didn't have anything sweet like
111:33 - not even hurt or anything for a long
111:35 - time and then when I finally did eat
111:37 - something actually I drank a half a can
111:39 - of Mountain Dew and I was sick like my
111:41 - stomach hurts so bad so I'm not to that
111:43 - point yet so I actually had a milkshake
111:46 - at the Google conference on Tuesday and
111:50 - it didn't make me sick my you know the
111:53 - my the next morning I felt I felt sick I
111:57 - did not have as much energy my stomach
112:00 - hurt like so I definitely felt the
112:02 - effects of because I didn't just have a
112:06 - milkshake I got a milkshake I had some
112:07 - gummy worms and I had a mini cupcake so
112:10 - I it was a one a little overboard but
112:16 - miraculously I still didn't go over on
112:19 - my calorie count so I don't know how
112:20 - that happened I guess I just didn't eat
112:23 - that much the rest of the day Frankie
112:31 - says we like your style Jesse Thank You
112:41 - Frankie whoa Orson says we have 37 users
112:51 - and JavaScript AF sweets
112:54 - that's awesome okay so I got to the
113:00 - point where ever my I asked you all to
113:02 - remind me if you wanted to link to my
113:04 - wife's coding blog I will get you that
113:06 - link right now let me check
113:10 - let me figure out it's only github
113:14 - profile so I'm like I pre sure I
113:22 - remember where the username is but let
113:25 - me double-check
113:26 - I did I submitted some pull requests or
113:35 - at least one pull request to it so it
113:38 - should be on my activity scroll through
113:42 - my activity on get up and find it there
113:45 - we go
113:48 - so Toby
114:03 - there we go all right so I'm gonna let
114:07 - me face this over here y'all can see it
114:08 - and then I'll paste it in the chat so it
114:11 - is Becca
114:14 - so Bek a hhw so it's two H's in a row
114:19 - got github do and that is her blog and
114:23 - she built that using jest no not just
114:28 - Jekyll justice for testing she built it
114:31 - using Jekyll and then did the theme it's
114:36 - not a premade theme so she did all that
114:38 - CSS and everything herself
114:42 - which really cool so I only helped
114:45 - slightly and you can see what I helped
114:49 - that if you check out the github repo
114:50 - you could see what-what I committed and
114:54 - what she committed and I did very little
114:56 - so really proud of her and she's a good
115:01 - writer I mean she's a writer first and
115:03 - she's been writing for a long time so
115:05 - it's cool blogging's not really my thing
115:07 - I prefer to do the video stuff but she
115:11 - does a good job with the blah
115:19 - John Hanson s if all the cards were
115:22 - links let's see you know the cards
115:28 - themselves are not links just the button
115:30 - just the button which I think that's how
115:33 - I want it maybe I'll make the image a
115:36 - link I think I'd be okay with that but
115:39 - I'd like to keep this part not a link in
115:41 - case someone wants to copy and paste a
115:43 - name or a title and you know what I
115:51 - think it'd be better if it should showed
115:54 - a regular name instead of like last name
115:56 - comma Oh what to figure out if there's a
116:00 - way to change that without having to do
116:04 - it manually just kind of automatically
116:06 - switch the order I think that might be
116:08 - maybe better hmm I think there is a way
116:14 - so I keep yawning you two need to drink
116:20 - my GP over here
116:55 - i nee ki says to slightly hijack the
116:59 - blob blog topic I'm writing a blog post
117:02 - about setting up a dev environment from
117:04 - scratch what else would you all like to
117:07 - be covered first part online already
117:11 - alright cool everybody let let leaky
117:14 - Niki know if you haven't already in the
117:16 - chat that sounds cool I don't know if
117:21 - you think about it I'll let you know if
117:23 - I think of something Niki I'm starting
117:26 - to get super hungry so I wonder I don't
117:30 - want to like think too much about it
117:31 - right now and take up more time in the
117:33 - stream but I will let you know if I
117:35 - think you saw this
118:15 - oh okay so I'm seeing now the mentioning
118:21 - using so Michael says you could use
118:24 - something like cheerio to scrape a text
118:26 - source source oh says can you use
118:29 - something like cheerio to scrape text
118:31 - source code and Harshit says you could
118:33 - use cheerio and the migration scripts so
118:39 - okay maybe I'll have to look into that
118:41 - you know what so much of the data has
118:44 - already been migrated though yeah I
118:52 - don't know at this point I don't want to
118:54 - go back and redo a bunch of the data
118:56 - that might actually take longer all
119:01 - right maybe I'll look into it I have to
119:02 - see if if I can still use it at this
119:04 - point
119:12 - Tech battle says hi hey how's it going
119:15 - thanks for watching
119:19 - okay earlier I was talking about
119:21 - LinkedIn showing who was hired to that
119:25 - company like what school air from and
119:27 - Christian is confirmed that that that is
119:29 - what LinkedIn does michael says Jesse I
119:33 - saw your tweet about Apollo hiring if
119:35 - only I was better that would be a dream
119:37 - job yeah the the job with Apollo if you
119:42 - all don't follow me on Twitter at least
119:45 - you can follow me if you want to but
119:47 - otherwise check out my profile I think
119:49 - there's a link in the description or
119:50 - maybe on my youtube page there's a link
119:54 - I recently retweeted a link from someone
119:58 - that works at Apollo saying Apollo's
120:00 - hiring I think several positions but you
120:03 - can work remotely and it seems like a
120:06 - really cool place to work with Apollo is
120:10 - like what we're using to help us out
120:12 - with some graph QL stuff here so you
120:14 - will be working on Apollo engine doing
120:17 - react stuff and well if you decided to
120:21 - do like the developer there's a couple
120:23 - other positions I believe that are open
120:25 - so I think it's cool I actually thought
120:27 - about applying
120:28 - self because I like a PO I use Apollo it
120:31 - would be cool but I already applied to a
120:34 - job at Apollo a while ago and I'm not
120:36 - sure if it was the same job or not
120:40 - I mean I guess it can't hurt to do it
120:42 - again so but anyway if anybody's
120:45 - interested you should apply it Michael I
120:46 - say why not apply I mean even if you
120:49 - don't think that you're experienced
120:51 - enough to do it you never know if if the
120:55 - application process you know isn't that
120:57 - hard to do which I don't think it is
120:59 - then you know give it a shot you know if
121:05 - you you know even if you get an
121:07 - interview and you don't get the job it's
121:08 - still great practice
121:32 - Faro spar wheel I'm not sure how to
121:37 - pronounce that but correct me if I'm
121:40 - wrong it says how experience must you be
121:43 - to start a project and react I know the
121:45 - basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript you
121:48 - know what I recommend using something
121:49 - called create react app to get started
121:53 - that'll help you it'll basically set up
121:56 - an entire working react project and then
121:59 - you just go in and edit what you can't
122:01 - and that's a great way to start so you
122:05 - you basically start with something that
122:07 - already works and you just play around
122:10 - with it so start with that and then just
122:13 - kind of work your way up in terms of
122:16 - being able to add more functionality to
122:18 - it but I mean if you already know basics
122:22 - HTML CSS and JavaScript then I say go
122:26 - for it you'll probably know pretty quick
122:28 - whether it's you don't know enough you
122:30 - know if you can't get anything to work
122:32 - then I don't know maybe you might want
122:35 - to do a little bit more learning but
122:39 - some of the best learning is just
122:41 - jumping in and encoding and trying it
122:44 - out
123:07 - spoil says is this just plain react yes
123:09 - I mean we have a lot other stuff so this
123:13 - is next j/s that we've used to create
123:18 - our react app so we are using some
123:21 - things that are next I mean we have
123:23 - materia I as well that we're using so we
123:26 - have a lot of the stuff we're using
123:27 - Apollo for graph QL so we have a lot of
123:31 - other stuff going on so I mean in terms
123:33 - of is it just plain react I don't know
123:36 - that we ever just use plain reacts we
123:39 - always have other stuff in on the
123:40 - projects but you know these these are
123:43 - react components and material is just a
123:46 - library of react components so even what
123:51 - Apollo gives us is you know basically
123:54 - react components to use that we can
123:57 - query data
124:12 - alright Phoenix says hey Jesse just
124:14 - wanted to tell you that streaming works
124:15 - totally fine on my laptop I even tried a
124:17 - test stream with code audio and camera
124:20 - input work just fine the only problem is
124:22 - that I look horrible in from the camera
124:24 - I might scare people with ha ha let's
124:26 - say that I mean if you really don't want
124:29 - your face on the camera you can just
124:30 - show your screen for all of my early
124:33 - streams I didn't show my face because I
124:35 - thought like nobody wants to see me
124:36 - right and then later on what I did find
124:39 - out from I think I read it and then I
124:47 - also I'm pretty sure that Quincy and Bo
124:49 - talked about it as well we did a Skype
124:52 - kind of group chat and we're saying that
124:55 - it's better to show your face
124:58 - essentially it's easier for people to
125:02 - understand you if they can see your
125:03 - facial expressions as you talk and then
125:08 - even beyond that it's you develop better
125:11 - relationships with your audience if they
125:13 - can see you so I thought okay well I
125:18 - need to just get over my not wanting
125:21 - anybody to see me and and just do it so
125:25 - I I do like now I'm very used to it
125:29 - and I like it at first I was kind of
125:31 - nervous and I'm like are there any like
125:32 - weird things that I do all the time that
125:34 - I don't even realize and everybody's
125:36 - going to see it and nobody's brought
125:39 - anything up so I guess I I don't but I
125:48 - don't know it just entirely depends I
125:51 - think it you know there's enough to try
125:53 - to worry about when you first start out
125:55 - that it maybe it is better to not show
125:57 - your face and just do your screen but
125:59 - it's it's definitely up to you but I'm
126:02 - glad that you got it all working though
126:39 - Michael's two columns in the card
126:41 - instead of two rows we were you thinking
126:50 - like
126:56 - leave leave the card sir you saying the
127:00 - image would be one column and then the
127:02 - content be another column I'm not sure I
127:08 - wonder see these aren't even the same
127:14 - dimensions
127:15 - yeah I'm not I I don't know but it's
127:24 - gonna take some work
127:25 - yeah I'm gonna have to rethink a little
127:28 - bit about how we've done this it just
127:31 - needs to be able to look okay with
127:36 - images of different shapes and sizes
127:37 - because evidently that's what we have to
127:39 - work with
127:43 - [Music]
127:50 - Phoenix saying could you make the image
127:52 - set with 100% I could do that but the
127:55 - problem would be then that these images
127:57 - are not large enough so they would look
127:59 - pixelated because we would be stretching
128:02 - them past their their natural width
128:09 - Michael said you could set the image of
128:12 - the the width max in a max width of the
128:18 - image to entitle to 50% so their line
128:25 - image with position and the other
128:27 - secondary text next to it then below
128:31 - them both props name across : oh yeah
128:40 - I'm gonna have to try out some different
128:42 - things albert asks how much would you
128:50 - charge your project that would only take
128:52 - you like at most three days I have an
128:55 - idea for a nice little website done and
128:58 - react firebase cloud and stripe I don't
129:03 - know so I guess the first thing is like
129:06 - a project that would only take three
129:07 - days I want it like I would I prefer to
129:11 - break it down by more like by hour if
129:14 - possible because I find that to be more
129:20 - accurate also in general and this is for
129:22 - any bug when you go to take a project
129:25 - assume you're gonna work on it a lot
129:27 - more than you a first estimate but maybe
129:31 - after you if you've been working for a
129:33 - long time you get really good at
129:34 - estimating then it'll be okay but
129:36 - generally like at least double how many
129:38 - hours you think it's gonna take and then
129:41 - consider like how much is my time really
129:43 - worth so at at this point I'm very busy
129:51 - so I know like any extra time that I
129:54 - take is gonna be time away from my kids
129:56 - it's gonna make my wife really upset
129:59 - because that means she is gonna have to
130:02 - not be able to do
130:03 - she wants to do because she's gonna have
130:05 - to watch all the kids and make sure that
130:07 - I have the you know the time to do the
130:11 - work so in fact during all of that in
130:14 - I'm gonna say like basically I'm I'm not
130:18 - interested in doing any work for you
130:21 - know anything less than I don't let's
130:24 - just say to make it a nice number a
130:26 - hundred dollars an hour one hundred US
130:29 - dollars right because it's just gonna be
130:33 - a lot it's gonna be a lot more stress a
130:34 - lot to deal with like you know
130:37 - potentially depending on the deadline
130:40 - like it could mess with my exercise
130:42 - schedule and I mean there's just a lot I
130:46 - plan on having to work overtime right
130:49 - now at work anyway from my project so
130:51 - that's what I'm saying so let's say a
130:54 - project is going to take three days
130:55 - let's assume I only worked eight hours a
130:58 - day on that project which is like a
131:00 - normal workday so what that's 20 18 24
131:11 - yeah 24 I can't do basic math on live
131:14 - streaming so let's just call it let's
131:18 - just say $50 or 50 hours let's assume
131:22 - I'm going to take 50 hours to do this
131:24 - project in reality then at $100 an hour
131:31 - like there's there's your price right so
131:40 - yeah so I mean that's that's what it is
131:43 - and I think people sometimes are shocked
131:45 - by the price of these types of projects
131:48 - but realistically like it's it's highly
131:55 - skilled work and especially if it's work
131:58 - on top of what somebody's already doing
132:00 - then you gotta value that more I mean
132:04 - even at least here in the United States
132:06 - even like government workers who are
132:09 - doing manual labor which I was doing I
132:11 - did that for six years
132:13 - just manual labor work for the
132:15 - government and you know when we would
132:19 - work overtime we got paid we call it a
132:23 - time and a half so like if I made let's
132:26 - say you know five dollars an hour then I
132:30 - would make seven dollars and fifty cents
132:34 - an hour when I got into overtime
132:36 - so like that extra time is the set is
132:39 - worth more so anyway that's my answer my
132:47 - long answer to that question is
132:49 - realistically I would probably charge
132:52 - five thousand dollars for site even if
132:56 - you think it's only gonna take three
132:57 - days I guarantee it will take more than
133:00 - three days and now like I said that's
133:04 - assuming we're talking eight hours a day
133:06 - for three days right that's you know if
133:09 - we're really talking like okay I'm gonna
133:11 - work two hours on it every day and it's
133:13 - only gonna take three days then it's a
133:16 - lot less money right but yeah and that's
133:22 - me - there may be other people that are
133:24 - in a different situation
133:25 - may be willing to take a lot less when I
133:28 - had a lot less experience like five
133:29 - years ago like five years ago when I
133:32 - started out I started before I didn't I
133:36 - knew barely anything I knew like no
133:37 - JavaScript very very basic CSS and HTML
133:42 - I worked for $10 an hour I didn't stay
133:46 - at $10 an hour for very long maybe like
133:48 - the first three months I was willing to
133:49 - work for $10 an hour after that I was
133:53 - never willing to work for that again but
133:56 - that that's how I started so I certainly
134:00 - was not as good I couldn't do this stuff
134:03 - then and it took me way longer to do the
134:07 - same thing so that's it's kind of
134:09 - another thing like you can always find
134:10 - somebody cheaper and depending on what
134:12 - you want that may be fine but you know
134:16 - you should realize one you're not gonna
134:17 - get as good of a product and it's going
134:20 - to take that person longer so if you are
134:22 - paying them by the hour realize that
134:25 - it's going to take them longer you
134:28 - so there's just so many factors that go
134:31 - into that and so when you're trying to
134:33 - price your your labor like really think
134:36 - about what like realistically what is it
134:39 - gonna mean for your lifestyle and for
134:41 - your family or you know your friends you
134:44 - know whoever is close to you what is
134:47 - that gonna mean for them
134:49 - what kind of hardship is that gonna be
134:50 - for them and and price accordingly the
134:55 - other way to price is how much value am
134:57 - I going to add to this company or this
134:59 - product and that's certainly a good
135:02 - price so for you
135:03 - you can think of how much you need to
135:06 - get paid but when you're explaining it
135:08 - to a client explain it in terms of how
135:11 - much money am I gonna make for you when
135:13 - this product goes live or how much money
135:17 - will you save when I do these
135:19 - improvements things like that
135:20 - so I wouldn't go in to a client and
135:23 - explain like what I just said to you you
135:26 - know in terms of well my wife is gonna
135:28 - have to watch the kids and all this
135:29 - stuff clients if they're nice people
135:31 - they might care but it doesn't really
135:33 - matter to their business what they want
135:35 - to hear is how is this gonna make me
135:38 - more money how is it going to make my
135:41 - the lives of my workers or my clients
135:44 - easier
135:45 - how's it gonna make me more efficient at
135:46 - what I do things like that
136:01 - Michael Carrillo says forgetting your
136:03 - wife's github username is worse than
136:05 - forgetting her birthday haha I'm gonna
136:07 - tell that to my wife and see what she
136:09 - says
136:14 - Phoenix says Becca is your wife she is
136:17 - one of my fave moms who code Twitter
136:19 - handles I never knew this until now
136:21 - coder family goes no way she'll be so
136:25 - happy when I tell her that she was
136:29 - actually really discouraged this morning
136:30 - I gave her like a pep talk well part of
136:33 - the reason she was too scared she was
136:34 - mad at me over me not letting her have
136:39 - enough time to code but then also she
136:42 - was discouraged in thinking like that
136:44 - she wouldn't be able to get a job too so
136:46 - stuff like that will really help keep
136:49 - her keep her positive so I mean I have
136:53 - my own issues with depression that get
136:55 - me down but she's working through things
136:57 - too like I'm not gonna give all her
137:00 - details away whatever you know if she
137:04 - wants to discuss things on her blog
137:05 - that's fine but like essentially like
137:06 - she's dealing with issues from traumatic
137:09 - things that happened regarding like the
137:12 - birth of our last child and so that
137:15 - that's still affecting her both mentally
137:18 - and physically so comments like that to
137:24 - my wife I think really really helped her
137:30 - so if anybody does know my wife you
137:33 - follow her on Twitter or anything like
137:35 - that please make sure you you know let
137:37 - her know if you appreciate what she's
137:39 - doing because you know sometimes she
137:44 - needs some encouragement
137:46 - we all need encouragement you know
137:55 - Frankie says blogging it's or the new
137:58 - magazines of our time oh yeah for short
138:03 - they need to make it's amazing anybody
138:06 - can set up a blog you know basically for
138:08 - nothing and yeah it's it's just it's
138:12 - great I mean there's it's hard to find
138:15 - like is this person worth reading I
138:18 - don't want to say that people aren't
138:19 - worth reading but like you know what I
138:21 - mean like figuring out who really is an
138:23 - expert on what you're trying to find out
138:25 - you know everybody's story has value but
138:28 - there's only so much time in the day so
138:30 - you're gonna find what's right but it is
138:32 - amazing that everybody has oh my a lot I
138:35 - shouldn't say everybody there are people
138:36 - that don't have access to the Internet
138:37 - and things like that but a lot of people
138:40 - have the ability to express themselves
138:42 - like that and that's that's just awesome
138:55 - so trying to get through this live chat
139:00 - all John says nikki has some great
139:03 - well-written content on his blog I'll
139:04 - need to check it out - all right yeah
139:08 - for sure what was I thought I saw him
139:10 - put the link to that in the in the chat
139:15 - off to scroll back through later on and
139:17 - find it and check it out cuz I haven't
139:19 - seen it yet
139:37 - Aniki says I thought of something I can
139:39 - add browser extensions that are handy
139:41 - for developers yeah that's a great idea
139:49 - all right Matthew says got a passing
139:53 - grade on my first front-end nanodegree
139:54 - project awesome so cool I'm very happy
139:59 - for you congratulations that's cool my
140:02 - wife I think just turned in her first
140:04 - project as well so I don't know if she
140:07 - got feedback yet she may have gotten it
140:09 - today while I'm working and I didn't
140:11 - hear about it yet but really cool Jones
140:18 - says if those cars are styled as display
140:21 - flex the width is determined from the
140:23 - image with yet but you know what John I
140:27 - think since the image is in that
140:30 - container that we brought in from the
140:33 - original markup I think it's messing
140:35 - it's messing that up also we I modified
140:40 - those cards as well so if maybe if I go
140:43 - back to doing a CSS background image so
140:48 - and use the card basically as intended
140:51 - by materialized or material UI maybe
140:54 - it'll solve so I there's a lot of
140:56 - different things I want to try so we'll
141:01 - see how it goes I don't know if I'll
141:03 - spend another stream on this or not it
141:04 - might start to get boring but we'll see
141:08 - I'll definitely show you all what the
141:11 - end result is and if I forget to show
141:13 - you just remind me world session the
141:18 - names on the card start with dr. yes for
141:20 - sure for sure they should
141:27 - Matthew says that's good advice my
141:29 - personal deadlines are always off yeah I
141:33 - assume you were talking about doubling
141:35 - the amount of time you think it's going
141:36 - to take yeah and I recommend when you're
141:39 - working on projects keep track of how
141:40 - long everything takes you you know like
141:43 - monitor your Pomodoro sessions things
141:45 - like that and that will help you to
141:47 - estimate later on yeah you can you can
141:49 - look back on previous projects and see
141:51 - like okay when I did this very similar
141:53 - thing it took me this long you know it's
141:57 - hard to just remember that you know when
141:59 - when a client asked like how long is
142:01 - this gonna take
142:02 - I'm it's almost impossible to accurately
142:04 - just rattle off a number you know you
142:07 - really need to go back in and study the
142:10 - data that you've already you know
142:12 - collected that you already put for each
142:15 - project for the amount of time how much
142:16 - it actually takes you to work on it and
142:19 - then base your estimates off of that and
142:23 - even then I would I would estimate a
142:26 - little more like if you intend to do
142:28 - anything new then it's going to take you
142:33 - longer than you think to really learn it
142:44 - world says who makes $5 an hour let me
142:47 - when I started working the first year I
142:49 - ever worked I worked for the city
142:52 - government and from the city I grew up
142:55 - in which is weird in West Virginia I
142:58 - worked for four dollars and seventy five
143:01 - cents an hour and that was what I made
143:07 - and I'm not gonna lie before that was
143:10 - actually before I could legally work so
143:12 - I had to get paid in cash I did work in
143:14 - some places where I made $2 an hour so
143:18 - it definitely happens it happens people
143:23 - work for that and I'm sure there are
143:25 - people that worked for way less than
143:27 - that still
143:38 - all right Albert says thanks I'll hit
143:40 - you up with more details to see how much
143:42 - our you think it's going to take for the
143:44 - website yeah no problem
143:53 - Tyron it's Tyr oh and I'm not sure if
143:56 - I'm pronouncing that right but anyway
143:57 - they say I know some JavaScript and I
144:00 - want to break into JavaScript frameworks
144:02 - etc but I just don't feel confident
144:05 - enough yet what are your thoughts that
144:07 - may help I'm gonna say kind of a similar
144:12 - answer that I gave earlier in the stream
144:14 - just try it out use create react app do
144:17 - like an intro a demo to react even the
144:22 - react documentation I believe starts you
144:24 - out with a really basic intro project
144:27 - and I think they use create react app
144:28 - for that if you're not familiar with
144:30 - what that is it's just something that
144:33 - helps you get started working with react
144:35 - and it actually starts you off with a
144:38 - complete working react project that's
144:40 - just very basic like a hello world
144:42 - you know project and so you start with
144:44 - something that already works and you can
144:47 - edit that so I find that very helpful
144:49 - just you know just start see how you
144:52 - like it see if it's too overwhelming for
144:55 - you you can always do something else but
144:59 - you know I would say don't don't think
145:01 - about it too much in terms of like
145:02 - wondering about it you know just jump in
145:05 - do some code like the only what are you
145:08 - going to lose you're gonna lose a little
145:10 - bit space on your computer for when you
145:12 - download all those node modules right
145:14 - and that's it and if that's not your
145:18 - thing you can always just delete it and
145:19 - move on you know you'll you'll miss
145:22 - you'll lose out on a few hours of your
145:24 - life I guess but I'd say just go for it
145:29 - alright and Matthew said thanks Jess
145:33 - you're welcome no problem
145:39 - all right finally got to the end of the
145:44 - chat this has been nearly two and a half
145:47 - hours of live stream Oh awesome I did
145:50 - pronounce them correctly I'm alright I'm
145:52 - really happy and for anybody if I ever
145:54 - do pronounce your name incorrectly
145:55 - please let me know I I would I really
146:00 - want to be respectful of how you want
146:02 - your net your name to be pronounced so
146:04 - let me know it's it's not an
146:07 - inconvenience for me at all to be
146:09 - corrected I definitely I want that so
146:14 - alright finally I'm gonna go get
146:16 - something to eat
146:17 - [Music]
146:21 - what's today alright so Mars Friday so
146:25 - us for Friday tomorrow I'll be working
146:27 - from home oh I'm gonna do my best to try
146:32 - to stream I'm not gonna lie when I work
146:34 - from home it's always harder to to
146:36 - shrink for some reason well number one
146:38 - the streams don't go as well because I
146:40 - don't have as good of internet or
146:42 - equipment but also like it's more
146:48 - comfortable at home and when you're
146:49 - comfortable it's easier to stay
146:51 - comfortable and just keep on coding and
146:53 - not like you start to do something else
146:57 - like like streaming so anyway but I'm
146:59 - gonna do my best to try to stream
147:00 - tomorrow I'll let you all know on
147:01 - Twitter on Instagram and through the
147:04 - notifications on YouTube if they work
147:06 - what time I will stream and so and so
147:10 - then have a wonderful day

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to live coding with Jesse I'm Jesse and this is my coworker Adam so my hands not in the picture they were I have to do it the opposite way they yeah it is confusing to get the directions right but anyway yeah so he works with me here at Franciscan University and he is a writer so you want to say what's up I mean apparently like within the next 10 years like computers are gonna be able to do what I do so but for the time being like I yeah I write stuff and yeah what's up everybody Ohio River Valley the loveliness of May that's great it is nice and May yeah cool if anyone is big country music fan I feel you really know if anyone is on your podcast but I don't know nobody likes country music let us know in the chat or in the comments if you're watching this either on okay see Don you mean him a real cool so yeah but anyways I'm out lovely to meet you all all right cool thanks Adam all right so I gave my Spotify on before we start I am in the office today as you might realize from the background and yeah so that was Adam and he's I think he's the newest addition to the team so he he's been here for I don't know if it's been a year yet but he's been here for a while but he's he's one of the newer people so yeah and I'm not a country music fan so I'm not exactly sure who he was talking about when he said he had the hookup so but if you all know then I guess you you understand but today we're going to work on that same component that we were working on yesterday so yesterday we had mentioned you know probably a few times that it would be great to get some other pieces of data and not have to actually go in and manually edit the data so I decided you know afterwards like hey you know what that that it would probably be better to just do what we have to do in the component to just pull in that mass of HTML and probably poorly formatted HTML and just pick out the pieces of data that we need and use those that that would take probably much less time not only for that particular use case but when we do that I I'm almost positive we'll find some other use cases where with just a few adjustments the same bit of code that we write today hopefully if it works will also work and save us a lot of time elsewhere because we're talking about in terms of WordPress posts I mean we're talking about hundreds and hundreds if if not into the thousands of posts so if we spend an hour today writing something that can save us from editing I don't know even a hundred posts or less that's definitely worth our time so I am working on getting some student workers to come in and maybe do some manual editing of the data you know to help out so that we don't have to do all kind of this weird stuff in our components to work with it but for right now this is what we have I can't count on that it's a it's a busy time for students so I'm not that hopeful that we'll get them they're all taking their finals now and their students are graduating this weekend so may or may not happen I do have one student intern but he's working he and some of his classmates are working on a totally different section of the site so I they're already busy with that I don't want to add more to what they're doing okay Oh before we start so yeah I'm just gonna take another minute tell you all about one more thing and and that way we may get some more viewers here for some reason we're down lower lower than our normal count I'm not sure what happened with that but I just want to let you know let me get it up on the screen here and let me switch views okay so I want to let you know about JavaScript AF and I'll put I'll put the linked directly in the free code camp chat here so this is a project I'm not doing it for my main job at the University this is a side project that really a lot of you came up with the idea so just to give you a tiny overview of this a while back I had the idea to check to see if there were any dot AF domain names that might be worth buying and JavaScript AF was available so I bought it and then I asked on Twitter and on Instagram and I believe on the show what should I do with this a domain name now that I bought it and someone on Twitter I can't remember their name but I need to go back and look it up because they deserve a lot of the credit someone on Twitter said why don't you use it too and I'm paraphrasing here but to highlight different JavaScript projects that are really cool that are happening in the community and I thought that was a wonderful idea also had JavaScript her on Instagram saw it and had had some other ideas as well so we ended up at first combining all the ideas and it was this massive undertaking and then we decided to maybe split that up and break it down to its core so at its core it's a way to share awesome JavaScript repositories with each other and and to search for these cool JavaScript repositories so that's that's what it is maybe we'll have more features later on we'll just kind of see how it goes but anyway since this was kind of like born out of collaboration between you all know the whole community around this stream I thought it'd be cool to just bring it up explain that a little and let you all know that you could check it out you can log in with your github profile and add your own repos to this get some exposure for your repositories check out what some of the other people were doing and you can also go to the github page for this and contribute it's entirely open source so if you would like to be involved in the project you know please do so that would be that would be really awesome so we have a lot of open issues that at least we did have it I think we still do I haven't I haven't checked the issues yet today so here actually we do we do have some issues so let me copy and paste the repository link as well so that's the link repository on github and yeah so I'm gonna stop talking about that since that's not really the title of the video but just want to throw that out there and I really hope that this turns into something that is useful for the community so it's going to be a free thing if it starts getting big we're gonna try to work out some ways to pay for the servers and stuff right now I'm just paying for them video personally but for now at least it's entirely free I just wanted I just wanted to have be something cool for for you all for the whole community so anyway let's go on to see what we did yesterday trying to find English faculty what is wrong canonical class as a function what a great way to start the stream it's already broken what did I do let's restart the server I did pull down all the changes that we made yesterday and let's do a hard refresh all right well now let's let's check out the air then I guess so faculty list like to cannot call class as a function all right let's check it out faculty list j/s yeah that doesn't make any sense out No all right let's see what we're we're doing Oh also hey everybody I noticed a lot of you were saying hi in the end the chat let me let me start my Pomodoro timer and as soon as that finishes I'll go to the chat I'll check out your questions to answer as many as I can what's so for those of you who watch yesterday this definitely worked yesterday right so we had it working and now let me see actually let me take this I think this call is gonna be about the project so let me take this hello pretty good are you doing I could I could talk quickly is that okay okay mmhm mmhmm mmmhmm mmhmm okay yeah yeah for sure that's yeah we have some kind of bolder button styles that we have available so definitely I think I'm I'm gonna meet with with Steven later today yeah yeah okay yeah and the only the only reason about the San Damiano thing is on a previous site there was kind of a big deal about do we use the San Damiano cross in outline in such a way I think it was on my bullet points and the decision was made that no like we're not gonna use it as bullet points if we use it it'll be like the the image and not utilitarian any in any way so I figured I can't use it now even if we wanted to because you know the for the people that worked on the previous project that wanted to use it they would immediately if they saw I'd say well why couldn't we do it all right yeah Oh awesome thank you oh that's great I really appreciate that you too right all right so sorry about that I do I'd like to take calls during the stream because this is supposed to my my real work so especially if I know the call is gonna be about the project that we're working on I like to take it that way y'all can hear how I interact with other people at the office and I can give you a recap of what we just talked about so that was the director of missionary outreach so our students go on spring break and on various holidays our students go on mission trips to various poor communities throughout the United States and throughout the world and they'll do things like teach and take care of children at orphanages and help feed the poor and all different kinds of charitable activities so he organizes all of that and the section of the website that's gonna deal with that we have my intern and several other students are working on that section so I haven't talked directly with the director yet it's always been a gobetween between the students meet with him and then the students meet with me so the director just called me to discuss one option about their his kind of idea for one section of the site and so basically the what it was is I had rejected that idea and it offered an alternate solution and he was happy with that and I was just explaining like why why we couldn't go with with that idea so I guess from that I just want to say like don't be afraid to be firm with your design principles that you're using and not compromise them and in this case there was no conflict it was here's why I don't want to do it like that here's an option that'll be good and and really he shared the reason why he wanted to do it like that and I think we could accomplish that same thing in a different way and I think it'd be even better a better user experience so he was fine with that and the call ended with him saying you know thank you for all your work the site looks awesome really excited about it so anyway doesn't always go that smoothly but you know it I guess just don't be afraid of potential conflicts you know over design especially designed user experience like if you know that what you want to do is the better way to go don't be afraid to stick up for it it may not even result in a conflict so I mean it's good to be flexible on things that really don't matter and then kind of save it for the things that do in this case this definitely did matter this was a decision they wanted to use the outline of the San Damiano crucifix which isn't it isn't our logo here but it's an image that's used frequently if you remember the catechetical Institute project we use that that image of the crucifix on on the homepage and they wanted to use the outline of it as a button to donate so it would essentially be the outline of that with the word donate in it and that would be a button and we had decided on a catechetical Institute project that we weren't going to instrumentalize the crucifix in that way being a sacred object for catholics and orthodox we didn't want to do that so i that was something that I definitely didn't want to budge on it was also something from a user experience standpoint that I thought would be confusing to users nowhere else on the site do we have a button that's designed like that at all I figured users probably wouldn't even realize that it was a button and was able to click on so it didn't have any precedent at all in anything we've done before or in material design and it would be confusing to the user so so for a lot of those reasons I had to be firm on that but anyway so sorry to go off on a little tangent those sorts of things I think are important to go over because you don't often get those in code tutorials that are just about the code but this job isn't always just about the code it's it's frequently about interaction with clients coworkers and things like that so having a product you can feel proud of sometimes isn't just about your skill as a coder you have to be able to influence others to accept decisions you make the right decisions so I've worked on projects before where it's at the end of the project I don't put my name on it there's no link to my website in the project because I couldn't be proud that the decisions that were made by the client I was not in agreement with so I did it but I'm not gonna say that's my website I wouldn't deny it if somebody asked but so anyway I just that's an important it's important skill that's often overlooked it's just not even thought of as as being a part of building something good but I really think it is on almost all of my projects it definitely would not have been as successful as it was if I had just gone along with whatever the people around me and above me suggested so especially if you're kind of in a position that I am where I'm one of the very few web developers that work here I have to remember like I I am the expert on this subject matter so while it might be someone higher up in the organization sometimes vice presidents of the organization they're giving their opinion but that's not their subject matter so very respectfully it's definitely up to me as the expert to say we're not I don't think we should do it that way here's why and unless the person is very egotistical then they're going to respect they're gonna respect that as long as you can give a good answer and usually I like to base it on data like you know the analytics show that if we do it this way we'll get more clicks more clicks equals more students more donors like then it goes well you know you got to know your stuff but anyway sorry enough of the sidetrack here I may have already used up my time I don't know what my timer is we're gonna go oh I'm still 15 minutes we'll keep this time we're going let's check out why this doesn't work maybe I'll check another let me check something else let's go with Fine Arts no it still doesn't work all right let's just try another pitcher so I'm pretty sure English has a page okay so that works it's just when I try to do faculty it's not working okay so obviously like this is giving me the line for the Distan like the bundled version is file which is not very helpful to me let's go can I go farther down and will it tell me you know let me just fine you know call class as a function you know I should check the live chat to see if any of you have any insight on the air Oh Frankie I see a lot of what you were saying about that it's helpful to hear what I was just talking about thank you for saying that I'm always not sure what's most helpful to you also I really appreciate that feedback okay I didn't look like anybody has any ideas yet sorry if I missed it all right so class cannot call class as a function so I don't think this is going to do anything but I'm really at a loss here you all were witnesses yesterday that this works who would we ended the stream yes hey what is different all right let me let me check to make sure the pool was successful so here's I did the get pool updating I faculty this side and that's what we worked on faculty the faculty list yes yeah I mean these look like the files that we work with yesterday it pulled down that code of conduct as well created that faculty this item J yes hmm I let's check out our faculty list item because I know the error is is saying it's in this page maybe but it maybe it's farther down and we're just not seeing it okay I should says try nuking node modules and re yarn oh good idea let's do that good idea I don't know why I always forget that hard [ __ ] this is like the second time this week you reminded me that that's a possible solution and hopefully it'll work alright so if you need to get rid of your node modules the easiest way I know of to do it is to RM RF the node modules do not do this command unless you are absolutely sure that you want to get rid of these files once you do this anything in the folder or any subfolders and any files in any of those folders will be gone and you cannot get them back they don't go in the trash they're gone okay so with that warning I'm about to do it so I'm gonna say RM and then given our RF flag and then I will say node modules so now let me turn the server off so doesn't freak out okay so if I try to go to let's say CD node modules it doesn't exist I'm trying to tab over there it's not Auto completing so it's gone now I'm gonna run yarn and it's gonna rebuild all those modules so for this machine it's probably not going to take that long if you have an older computer this may take longer if you have a non reliable internet connection probably not a good idea to do so just kind of a little a little warning if you need to get something done you might want to try a different method to fix it this is like I don't know for me this is like when something doesn't work on a Windows computer and you just reinstall windows like this it's like wow I don't really know what the problem is so let's just reset everything right while that's doing its thing I'll check out a few things in the live chat just some of the latest stuff that popped up Mme says hey long time no see how are you I'm doing pretty good how are you I'm glad to see you back in the in the chat whoa that was so fast that was less than a minute awesome okay so let's restart the server and see if it works for this particular project we use the command yarn dev may not be the same depending on what you're using for your project but for next J s projects dev is pretty standard alright it's refreshing it's refreshing refreshing no ah okay are we getting a different error it's no it's exactly the same error shoot I guess I ought to just read this it's kind of avoiding actually reading all of this but now maybe I'll read a little bit more and see if I can find out what what's happening all right that's that's not helping me at all I don't know if you all saw anything all right so let me see you check the network I want to see I'm gonna refresh this and see if if anything happened like did did an actual request get made nah whoops okay let's see John says I wonder if you may have placed your component as a child argument into another component if the child is a class it can't work if it is written as an argument all right I'm not I'm not exactly following that train of thought I don't know maybe John can you explain it to me maybe pretend maybe you don't have to pretend that much but pretend like I have no idea what I'm doing you explain it to me please all right you know what I didn't check out any of our other components that we change so let's do that now as well let me get rid of some of these my components of here faculty was that oh I should saw the error export see with stylus of parentheses you have open and close them okay cool I'm pretty sure this is what I I did in this work yesterday after I did this I thought I tried to do in a different way it didn't work then I looked up how we did it on in a different page what page was that was it the index no I doubt it was the index I mean it's worth looking at but yeah that's nothing I don't think it was the search fish proof I see okay ref ref all let me know if I mispronounce that but thank you for that so Rafal thinks it was majors or major yes awesome what a good memory thank you okay so here's how we did it oh okay all right so I it looks like I did do it wrong so let's check so we have one open front the second one here one open one open and and I shouldn't have it I shouldn't have closed it I should have closed it there I should have closed it here that's really odd I mean I thought it worked I I don't know I don't know what happened unless I somehow have my editors set differently with Auto formatting and it messed it up I don't I don't know I mean I guess we'll find out if we if we try to commit this and it formats it weird but I don't know it doesn't make sense anyway this works so everybody that that caught that thank you so much all right Wow and we're almost the end the Pomodoro session so I'm just gonna start answering questions take a fiveminute break answer questions that'll be good cuz I can relax my brain for a second from trying to figure out that error and I just realized I don't have my light on there we go when we come back then we'll come back to this and start doing what I had hoped we would be doing but that's that's cool that happens that's because that's life that's how it happens sometimes so I'm really glad that I decided to work on this during the stream today because you you all were very very big help and potentially save me a lot of time alright let's start this whoops short break I'm scrolling all the way up to the top and I'm just gonna work my way down through as many questions as I can and anything I don't get now I'll get after the next Pomodoro session okay Christian asked if I still use the dev Franciscan dot University yes let me let me put that in there dev all right so I just put that in the live chat if you want to check out this site the development version go to dev da Franciscan University at some point today if I can remember I'd like to update that with the latest changes so right now it's it's a like maybe a week behind in terms of what we've been doing on the stream so I'd like to update it soon thanks for reminding me about that Christian Frankie says greetings as how you don't want hope all as well not bad I'm feeling really happy today actually I mentioned last week or so that I was going on a diet and exercising and so far I felt I felt a lot better definitely more energy in the morning I've lost seven pounds so I mean it's it's it seems like it's going really well and I don't know I mean you know everybody always says if you eat healthy and you exercise you'll feel better and I always hope that they were wrong because I'd like to eat donuts all the time and and I don't know like just I'd like to eat anything I want to eat right but over the last two weeks it's definitely been my experience that I do feel a lot better so unfortunately it is true if you want to feel good and have energy you gotta exercise and eat right that makes me so sad but it's true yeahhaha I just read her should have a comment in here it's let's see what we've done yesterday then good old next yes error page maybe laugh at I'm I'm glad that it made you laugh yeah that's outer eyes just how it is sometimes jayson's notice it's a hard line the phone yeah so the phone in my office is actually connected with the cord they still exist anybody who's really young and watching this this is how all phones were at one time when I was little I remember we had a really long cord so that my mom could walk all the way around the house and do stuff and still be on the phone so yeah so those are the folks that we have sure sure ah sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong Shura says what are all the live streams that free cocaine does I do most of the live streams occasionally we do have some other people live stream as well I think Ethan Arrowwood did some live streams he hasn't done one in a while though so I'm not sure if he's planning on doing anymore or not so yes pretty much I I believe it's pretty much just me and most of our other videos are prerecorded at this point so unfortunately it's just me so if you if you don't like my style I guess there's not another option for you right now but if you'd be interested in doing something like this for free code camp reach out to beau Carnes or Quincy and you know propose something you might be able to do some streams as well or videos ronan says hello hey Ronin how's it going thanks for watching Frankie I'm just seeing all your messages when I was talking about the phone call that I had thank you so much for all the encouragement I don't know if you realize how much that that helps me and motivates me to keep going and just I mean honestly just makes me feel really good so thank you so much I appreciate that okay so my times up I want to write down where I'm leaving off in the chat so I can go right back to it afterwards okay I've written that down and let's see let me start this wonderful now I can tell you what I was going to tell you at the very beginning of the stream it's taking me a bit longer than I thought but here's the page we're going to be working on we want to make it look nicer here's the data that I really want to be here I want an image of these particular faculty members and I also want their title I want that to be like the minimum data that we display at some point later on maybe we'll display more but right now I think that's bare minimum because that's what's already on the website the the current website that we'll be replacing so let's let's get to it we need to we need to see the data first to figure out how we're gonna get it so let me go into WordPress and log in and we'll go to faculty and we'll pick I guess I'll go in here to classics I'll go to uh Sarah where because she's a really cool person and I know her my wife knows her a lot better than I do but I saw her when I was in the back of church with my kids one Sunday cuz the baby was making a fuss she had her newborn baby back there and she was super nice so I'm gonna feature her today we want to get this and it's inside a title tag which is great because we should be able also awesome I am super happy about this so we can focus on finding this title tag and then get the data out of here and use that as the title I just glanced at the chat and so Frankie ass is is your wife a coder she is so she actually did teach in the English department which I was just showing she was an adjunct so she didn't show up on the website but she taught there she just taught her last class last week and now she is learning to code she's been learning for a few months and she was with me at the Google i/o conference just the extension conference in Pittsburgh and she's she works now for moms can code which is a nonprofit to help moms learn how to code so she's teaching a course on blockchain development with solidity so really cool she really likes it so far of course I've been encouraging and and we were up before the kids got up this morning working on code and so that's been fun and she actually has a blog too so it's it's on github I should I should link it after somebody remind me after this Pomodoro session is over and I'll paste in the link to my wife's blog because she blogs about coding related stuff and she built her own blog as well so we can get title where's there's the image that we want okay so we have two different images one is supposed to be a smaller image and the other one is supposed to be a larger image assuming that they were all put in correctly into the old system which I don't know if they were or not actually we we could probably grab this entire image tag so we could just say anything that's inside this list view image we can grab the whole thing we'll see if this image works if it's too small then we'll grab this detail view image okay let's see all right so I this is actually doable I was worried that it would be really hard but this seems doable I do want to check I think we have some code and other components that can help us get a jump start on this so let's find what component already has some of this stuff in here and then we'll we'll try to use that so I'm gonna leave this up on this screen but jump over here quickly what screen is it you know what maybe it's the profile oh no that's where's the should be faculty is a faculty okay there we are so you can see in this page we're doing some searching for for content hmm and in this case we are removing removing things and putting in okay so actually we ought to keep okay we got to keep some of this countenance retirees hmm all right well let's just let's start into it and see see how far we can get so in our we'll do this in our faculty list should we are we passing in content factor this item profiling profile link content okay we can pass in content I guess we'll do it here in this component I think that makes more sense to do it here okay so let's make sure we pass in the content and content okay let's save that uhhuh Aniki noticed again that I have this global X content which was just in there for testing and I keep forgetting to remove it everywhere so good catch on that like I don't I see it and it just doesn't occur to me at all to take it out I don't know what's wrong with my brain it's just it's it's like it's it's not even there okay all right so now we're done with this and then we're going to be working here in our faculty list item component by the way if I haven't said it already all of this code that we're working with is available on github the links in the description it's all open source feel free to use any of it for any purpose you want I mean try not to use it for anything bad but I really can't stop you okay so what we want to do then is take the content and we're gonna manipulate it to get what we want from it so we're not exactly going to do it like this where we create a constant called content we're gonna split it up because we're basically going to want image and then we'll want a constant called title and we'll split it up like that so you know what let's just copy listen let's copy a bunch of this stuff here and in the context of faculty j/s this is this is in a different place than we're gonna put it here because we're doing different things this is inside a query component so this is a little bit different so let's see what we can put this I believe we can put it right here and that would be a decent spot for it so let's just say let's call this one image and let's call this one title and here we can take out all of this stuff and just say content and we can also do that here so let's take this we're getting these red lines here because we haven't used it yet so it's it's fine once we use it down here and our component it should work so let's see what's happening this replaced details we can get rid of that but before I completely take it out I'd like to see if we could just adjust it to do what we want so let's go back and look so basically what this is doing is finding the tag called details and then replacing it with a different tag so I don't think that that's really what we want to do here so we're not gonna do that now you know what let me let's let's check out an article on MDN why it should be sort of this JavaScript I don't remember exactly what this returns when we do search but this might be what we want if we notice with us in the sky the index to the first match between the regular expression and they give a string if not found on okay so it will return weight will turn the index of the first match I don't really want the index what I want testaments shame or information with sufficient use of a match returns for yeah I don't want the index okay so let's check match and let's see I'm just checking the chat really quickly usually if I'm heading down the wrong path in my research then you all let me know so that's who I wanted to doublecheck I see a lot going on in the chat so that's awesome I can't wait to to check it out after this Pomodoro session I clicked the wrong thing okay if you're not familiar with mdn it's the Mozilla developer Network and it's always like maybe the first or second thing that comes up in a google chat when you look up JavaScript stuff and other stuff too but I find it to be one of the best resources if you really want to get to know what certain thing does alright so this will return the string match deficient we're turning an array containing the entire match string as the first element followed by any results captured in parentheses if there were no matches null is returned okay let's see the examples alright so here they've they made a variable called fountain and that equals string here so this string and then they've matched it with this regular expression so the log shows string which is C chapter okay actually I sent you for more information okay all right I think this will work so if anybody knows of a better method to use maybe something more performant I'm open to that as well but for now I think we're going to use this and this this should work okay so let's see a non rigid object all right so let's grab all right oops wrong way here we go so let's get rid of this I want to keep the replace though so we're gonna do dot match and what we want to match is let's see let me look back here I'm not I don't have regular expression stuff you know all memorized so I always have to look it up so let's go with what is this supposed to be image detail I need to look at what this was I can't remember what it was exactly okay so I'll list view image that's what we were gonna use all right so ListView image and let's see we want to end anybody good with regular expressions help me out here let me explain what I want and then help me out if you can otherwise I'm gonna have to look up the correct syntax here which is okay I'm not complaining about that but I just want to use you all as resources if I can so what I'd like to do is let me go back to here to visa so I'd like to get all the data that is between this opening ListView image tag and this closing ListView image tag so that's what I'd like to do let's see drinks every are so I said read reg reg X which is for from regular expression fine string between two strings Menace over to match all characters between two strings let's see extract string area extract string between two strings that's what we want okay No look behind is not supported in JavaScript am I not gonna be able to use this then let's see Michael says this is what I was going to play around with yesterday I thought you're gonna get the intern to do it Oh what I was gonna do with the intern is I was going to get the intern to manually edit the data so that we didn't have to do this so but then I decided well like number one I don't really the intern is working on other stuff and then number two it would probably be better if I just do this because most likely have to apply it to other cases as well all right so I need to try to make sense of this matches a percent character okay so this is a look behind okay maybe won't be able to use this because this isn't supported in JavaScript they have to find another one I'll leave it up just in case but let's see it so much every character between this is a sent in synthesized it's still it's using the look behind included fuse cases hmm all right let's try let's try this okay yeah this show that oh okay John says if you use style components you can bring in the whole string you set a Const for your element name which is the element and nest the image in the CSS styling this can all be wrapped and material huh that's interstate hmm skewed all right let's let me throw this in quickly and then I will need you look at the end in I can't use you use this to escape this ring this team image it's an expression we'll see some stuff all right I saw some stuff pop up in the chat I wondered if it was about this but looks like our [ __ ] just came back so welcome back our [ __ ] what am I missing initiation let me check that mdn see what that one alright said they have all I regular the regular expressions as separate variables I mean I guess I could try it like that if that's I said I want it I check again okay again Oh I don't know what I was thinking I could probably move this back in here actually let me put it back in you oops I mean back in here Wow why can't i okay I do this right here wait a second oh I I highlighted everything there we go okay all right so what I'm doing then and now I do I want to replace or I want to add in Franciscan dotty to you for now and let's throw in image i order that the invalid regular expression let's so let's do another break I'll go back answer some more questions and then we'll work on this there's something wrong with my regular expression syntax so I think as soon as we figure that out it should work so may not need a whole nother Pomodoro session for that okay so I'm going to go back up to where I left off in the live chat and answering questions Aurra or era I'm not sure how to pronounce this ara it says what editor is this it's Visual Studio code okay himemiya says earlier I asked the many how he was no one in then I didn't get a chance to read their Swan [ __ ] so the responses says thanks I want to say that lately I have been accepted in a Google Africa scholarship for mobile web specialists at Udacity if you can tell us your option about these online certificates oh yeah for sure I think the Udacity courses are great you learn a lot in terms of the actual certificate and its value it's entirely dependent on a company and what the company thinks so if a company has already hired people from Udacity they will probably depending on how those employees worked out they will probably have a higher opinion of a nano degree certificate from Udacity otherwise you just you never know no one at the company may have heard of Udacity before and you know maybe they're skeptical of it so it's not a guarantee at every company but you can check out a company on LinkedIn and it should tell you you should be able to see how many people went to Udacity so I think if you have Udacity listed as a school in your LinkedIn profile when you look at companies profiles or at least their job listings it should tell you how many other people from Udacity got hired and work at that company now it's imperfect measurement because there could be people from Udacity that work at that company that don't have get up profiles so you you may not get 100% accurate results but that should at least let you know like the company hired ten people from Udacity you know maybe they know what's up you know that Udacity is a good place to work but my feelings are about it or like you you learn a lot if you're the type of person that does well when an hour with our deadlines and structure I think it's a great great way to learn you know the cause if you have a scholarship it's great because to me the only downside to Udacity is is paying for it when there are so many great free resources out there it's really hard to commit to paying for a program so I think the scholarship thing is wonderful my wife's working through the frontend nanodegree right now she also got a scholarship so and I did the react nano degree I didn't get a scholarship I just paid for it but yeah so I I definitely do recommend it assuming that it works within your budget and your financial situation hater says what is the best way to handle media queries with react that is a great question let's take a look quickly at how we handle it here so in in particular we can go in the component right we we have media queries here well if you're using a framework like material UI they may have ways to do media queries so materialise way to handle media queries here is they have these break points or we can do theme break points and then up and it you know extra large screen so basically this allows us to mimic the functionality of media queries when using CSS in within our component also you could just make a regular CSS file use media queries as you normally would and then pull it into the file which we're not doing here are we doing it yep we're doing it here so you can see we are pulling in a regular CSS file into our component and in this manner as well so and these aren't the only ways to do it there are a ton of different ways to do CSS within JavaScript for react so these are just two ways that we happen to be doing it on this project so they're you know I'm sure if you if you search for to talk to other people you'll find a lot of other ways to do it as well so my timer is up for now so we're gonna do one more Pomodoro session I'd say no matter what this is gonna be our final Pomodoro session so whether or not I get this to work we'll just we'll just end it then because it's it starts to be a really long stream and I'm sure it's okay for you all you could all could handle it at least you can handle the code I don't know if you had me talking that long but it starts to get really tiring for me and my brain just gives like too much so I know I'm gonna be no good after another Pomodoro session of streaming all right so let's start up our timer for one more Pomodoro session and now let's let's check out a regular expression see what I messed up with this and figure out what I need to do so I'm gonna copy this regular expression over to one of these services that lets you test your regular expressions let's see let me see if I can just get a new one well what's that one somebody put in a latch at the URL to another one good I think I've used that other one regex 101.com let's try that one nope not brazier is eggs All Right see here's our regular expression and then let's let's pull in let's bring in our data to test with and it matched what what the heck it words what is going on alright so which part let me let me go check this error message again Oh Phoenix just got here said there's no notification for the stream I don't know what happened with that I'm really sorry you didn't get a notification I started in early this morning I scheduled it so that I was hoping all the notifications would go out so really sorry about that let's see I'll use an explanation alright so the first part matches the character list view image literally casesensitive which is what we want this question as matches the remainder of the pattern with the following effective flag s modifier use single line dot matches new line characters first capture group matches any character quantifier matches between zero and unlimited times as many times as possible okay this matches the character literally case sensitive case sensitive list image you literally could sense it okay Group one match okay John Hanson says JavaScript flavor oh okay good that was that was a very good idea there I was not using the JavaScript style of regex so I can't use this question mark hmm all right well let's change machine C strings DDoS good I just read is up all right so the look ahead doesn't work so you want to capture him at you cow for change to capture your Shima cash inside the parentheses okay let's try this well that was easy okay okay let's see what happens now cannot reap any match of undefined hmm all right what am i doing probably shouldn't be now that's not what I want that's when they didn't work Oh hold on a second match I need to do should work shrink up match there should be content match and then okay sit sing can't reprimand fine saying content is undefined all right let's try like that let me see let me make sure faculty lists are we passing in so we are passing content let's make sure it is zero known faculty edges it's I want to see what the data structures that we're getting in here so let's go in dev tools and I'll make this bigger and let's go into reader now I'm not using Redux so not have I thought I had Apollo dev tools hooked up here but I guess not trying to find where content is there we go Michael you're you thinking the same thing as I'm sorry I haven't been I've been quiet what I'm thinking is the we're not actually getting the correct data so our regular expression and our match our dot match can't work because there's nothing there for it to work on so I want to figure out what the data structure is I was hoping I could easily find it here I was actually hoping that I had Apollo dev tools I don't know why I don't have it and I can't find where the data is I guess I could let me go within the component and see okay so there's nothing so this content faculty node content said that this is not being cast down as a prop so we get the profile link profile name but nothing is here so I think yeah there's there's a problem there so in a page where we are using the content data this props data type edges zero that's the content so it's not listed so that's that's the problem so up here we have snowed faculty edges zero all right so let's let's say I put edges zero here hopefully it won't mess everything up but let's see if this would make a difference faculty data dot map is not a function okay so that's it's not working there I guess I could just look it up here as I said this extension alright so am I'm not actually getting the content haha alright let's double check this ha ha I'm not bringing in that piece of data that's what it doesn't exist alright okay then let's let's look at exactly how I brought this in here I I titled slow content okay great okay and then down here hey there's our content lots of it hi let's take this and we'll say no definitely do not want the content there what I want there is the title and let's I wonder if I still need that let's let's try that the place is not a function Shh he's replacing on a function see if I can do it this way okay so that did work actually so we could see where the content is it's replaced and added this franciscan dot edu which is wonderful now let's let's go in here and put our image in see if that works and our title is still giving us of course everything so let's do a match let's get rid of all of this and let's match for title yay check that out okay so we have this professor share of English okay works but you know we actually don't want a title tag in the middle of our HTML right because saito tags have a meaning in HTML we don't want it to be that so let's let's grab this and let's add this here and first we're gonna replace title so what we'll do is instead of just having title tags we're going to take out the type of tags replace them with div tags and then put in the class of title and then let's see I guess I'll have to change this up let's see if I can switch it didn't let me switch the order but let's see if we can switch the order this time let's see what's going on with this lists you image probably what's happening here is I see yeah let's just put in a div and we'll just say actually let's do this image No okay I said you need to do this differently just put this here and then let's let's take this and make this what we need to match and with this let's just switch that to death so you know alright cool we have images whoa we have different sized images alright see so I I had mentioned I that the images had to be input correctly so obviously there are different sized images here so let's change it up and use the large size image for everyone since this is amazing all also we need to change how we input this this title so let's use detail view image instead so instead of ListView image we use detailed view image and then with our title we want to add in a dangerously set in our HTML in here in our typography we can do that I don't know if I've ever tried to do that in a typography component let's see see if we can do it what what what what what did we just do okay evidently I messed something up oh yeah I put content instead of title there we go Wow what what is happening what did I do let's see okay so that's detail view image there should be only one all right what I'm doing is getting displayed twice okay this isn't anything what is happening all right what if I what am i doing that displays this twice I did something wrong what did I do hmmm not exactly sure what I did I wasn't getting devil images before somehow I'm getting them now not sure what changed what cheese I don't know I can't see it Michael s why does that one image have a details list image tag in dev tools yeah I don't understand just one has it it's the same image and then it's there's a comma in between here and a comma in between these as well so we have the div with the class professor of English and then we actually have professor English at the end oh I see what's happening okay okay all right here's what we need to do match see image is all right let's see that yeah there we go still Wow these images are I might have to change my we might have to change this layout like I can't like the size of these images are 200 by 300 pixels and this is the details view which means they're the bigger image so if all I get is 2 by 3 I have 200 pixels wide we may need to go back to a list view or at least we got to change this I'm not gonna do it right now in today's stream but we got to work with the images that we have and right now we have small images so if this is the images we have to work with and we need to adjust our cards we obviously can't shrink the card all the way down to this image there wouldn't be enough room for the text that way it would look really weird right we I don't want to have stuff on a bunch of different lines it would be okay for this section I suppose but I don't want the titles going on two different lines so I mean I guess I could let's just try it let's try it and then I don't think I would like it though so where's our cards I'm gonna fix all right let's just say max width is 200 pixels okay so that shrinks all our cards down I mean what do you all think like a card this size I don't know about it I mean I could maybe try to reduce the padding it would be a little better you know and then maybe go one two three four like four across so would it be better to do that it would be better to have basically rows with the image name title link and then the image is here I'll let you all have some time to let me know what you think about that idea and right now I'm gonna scroll back up to where I left off in the in the chat I'm gonna answer some questions and then once I get down to the bottom out I'll see what you all think about that that'll determine what I do next with these with these cards and then I will I'm not gonna change it right now I'll commit this and then once I'm done streaming maybe I'll get something to eat because my stomachs growling sorry if you all heard that hum and then I need to get back to you data transfer so I'll be doing that the rest of the day okay so Phoenix is Oh No I'm a whole hour ahead of the live chat let me show that this dream has been we're coming up on two hours Wow since the stream is going on so long I'm gonna try to just read the questions maybe a comment or two of course I will look at them all I'm just not gonna read them all out loud just to save a bit of time John Henson says do you get some or maybe too many unresolved coding problems haunting you to try to sleep at night coding seems to embed itself in one's gray matter yeah it depends so if I do if I have a problem that I can't figure out and I've worked on it for a really long time I still didn't figure it out it does bother me especially if I like I'm out of ideas occasionally I will code in my sleep sometimes I come up with good ideas from my sleep coding and I mean like I dream about coding I don't actually get up and start coding so sometimes in my dreams I figure out something sometimes it actually works if I try it when I'm awake yeah but lately I've been I've been okay I haven't really been worrying too much about any code Matthew says do you have to use metaprogramming at all things like symbols proxies and reflection no I don't and I haven't really heard that much about it so I don't know what I'm kind of interested to know more about it though but I don't use it let's see Christian says well if you keep this up with a healthy eating you will find out eating sweets is not that tasty yeah I long time ago before I was married maybe like 1314 years ago I was on a diet where I didn't have anything sweet like not even hurt or anything for a long time and then when I finally did eat something actually I drank a half a can of Mountain Dew and I was sick like my stomach hurts so bad so I'm not to that point yet so I actually had a milkshake at the Google conference on Tuesday and it didn't make me sick my you know the my the next morning I felt I felt sick I did not have as much energy my stomach hurt like so I definitely felt the effects of because I didn't just have a milkshake I got a milkshake I had some gummy worms and I had a mini cupcake so I it was a one a little overboard but miraculously I still didn't go over on my calorie count so I don't know how that happened I guess I just didn't eat that much the rest of the day Frankie says we like your style Jesse Thank You Frankie whoa Orson says we have 37 users and JavaScript AF sweets that's awesome okay so I got to the point where ever my I asked you all to remind me if you wanted to link to my wife's coding blog I will get you that link right now let me check let me figure out it's only github profile so I'm like I pre sure I remember where the username is but let me doublecheck I did I submitted some pull requests or at least one pull request to it so it should be on my activity scroll through my activity on get up and find it there we go so Toby there we go all right so I'm gonna let me face this over here y'all can see it and then I'll paste it in the chat so it is Becca so Bek a hhw so it's two H's in a row got github do and that is her blog and she built that using jest no not just Jekyll justice for testing she built it using Jekyll and then did the theme it's not a premade theme so she did all that CSS and everything herself which really cool so I only helped slightly and you can see what I helped that if you check out the github repo you could see whatwhat I committed and what she committed and I did very little so really proud of her and she's a good writer I mean she's a writer first and she's been writing for a long time so it's cool blogging's not really my thing I prefer to do the video stuff but she does a good job with the blah John Hanson s if all the cards were links let's see you know the cards themselves are not links just the button just the button which I think that's how I want it maybe I'll make the image a link I think I'd be okay with that but I'd like to keep this part not a link in case someone wants to copy and paste a name or a title and you know what I think it'd be better if it should showed a regular name instead of like last name comma Oh what to figure out if there's a way to change that without having to do it manually just kind of automatically switch the order I think that might be maybe better hmm I think there is a way so I keep yawning you two need to drink my GP over here i nee ki says to slightly hijack the blob blog topic I'm writing a blog post about setting up a dev environment from scratch what else would you all like to be covered first part online already alright cool everybody let let leaky Niki know if you haven't already in the chat that sounds cool I don't know if you think about it I'll let you know if I think of something Niki I'm starting to get super hungry so I wonder I don't want to like think too much about it right now and take up more time in the stream but I will let you know if I think you saw this oh okay so I'm seeing now the mentioning using so Michael says you could use something like cheerio to scrape a text source source oh says can you use something like cheerio to scrape text source code and Harshit says you could use cheerio and the migration scripts so okay maybe I'll have to look into that you know what so much of the data has already been migrated though yeah I don't know at this point I don't want to go back and redo a bunch of the data that might actually take longer all right maybe I'll look into it I have to see if if I can still use it at this point Tech battle says hi hey how's it going thanks for watching okay earlier I was talking about LinkedIn showing who was hired to that company like what school air from and Christian is confirmed that that that is what LinkedIn does michael says Jesse I saw your tweet about Apollo hiring if only I was better that would be a dream job yeah the the job with Apollo if you all don't follow me on Twitter at least you can follow me if you want to but otherwise check out my profile I think there's a link in the description or maybe on my youtube page there's a link I recently retweeted a link from someone that works at Apollo saying Apollo's hiring I think several positions but you can work remotely and it seems like a really cool place to work with Apollo is like what we're using to help us out with some graph QL stuff here so you will be working on Apollo engine doing react stuff and well if you decided to do like the developer there's a couple other positions I believe that are open so I think it's cool I actually thought about applying self because I like a PO I use Apollo it would be cool but I already applied to a job at Apollo a while ago and I'm not sure if it was the same job or not I mean I guess it can't hurt to do it again so but anyway if anybody's interested you should apply it Michael I say why not apply I mean even if you don't think that you're experienced enough to do it you never know if if the application process you know isn't that hard to do which I don't think it is then you know give it a shot you know if you you know even if you get an interview and you don't get the job it's still great practice Faro spar wheel I'm not sure how to pronounce that but correct me if I'm wrong it says how experience must you be to start a project and react I know the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript you know what I recommend using something called create react app to get started that'll help you it'll basically set up an entire working react project and then you just go in and edit what you can't and that's a great way to start so you you basically start with something that already works and you just play around with it so start with that and then just kind of work your way up in terms of being able to add more functionality to it but I mean if you already know basics HTML CSS and JavaScript then I say go for it you'll probably know pretty quick whether it's you don't know enough you know if you can't get anything to work then I don't know maybe you might want to do a little bit more learning but some of the best learning is just jumping in and encoding and trying it out spoil says is this just plain react yes I mean we have a lot other stuff so this is next j/s that we've used to create our react app so we are using some things that are next I mean we have materia I as well that we're using so we have a lot of the stuff we're using Apollo for graph QL so we have a lot of other stuff going on so I mean in terms of is it just plain react I don't know that we ever just use plain reacts we always have other stuff in on the projects but you know these these are react components and material is just a library of react components so even what Apollo gives us is you know basically react components to use that we can query data alright Phoenix says hey Jesse just wanted to tell you that streaming works totally fine on my laptop I even tried a test stream with code audio and camera input work just fine the only problem is that I look horrible in from the camera I might scare people with ha ha let's say that I mean if you really don't want your face on the camera you can just show your screen for all of my early streams I didn't show my face because I thought like nobody wants to see me right and then later on what I did find out from I think I read it and then I also I'm pretty sure that Quincy and Bo talked about it as well we did a Skype kind of group chat and we're saying that it's better to show your face essentially it's easier for people to understand you if they can see your facial expressions as you talk and then even beyond that it's you develop better relationships with your audience if they can see you so I thought okay well I need to just get over my not wanting anybody to see me and and just do it so I I do like now I'm very used to it and I like it at first I was kind of nervous and I'm like are there any like weird things that I do all the time that I don't even realize and everybody's going to see it and nobody's brought anything up so I guess I I don't but I don't know it just entirely depends I think it you know there's enough to try to worry about when you first start out that it maybe it is better to not show your face and just do your screen but it's it's definitely up to you but I'm glad that you got it all working though Michael's two columns in the card instead of two rows we were you thinking like leave leave the card sir you saying the image would be one column and then the content be another column I'm not sure I wonder see these aren't even the same dimensions yeah I'm not I I don't know but it's gonna take some work yeah I'm gonna have to rethink a little bit about how we've done this it just needs to be able to look okay with images of different shapes and sizes because evidently that's what we have to work with Phoenix saying could you make the image set with 100% I could do that but the problem would be then that these images are not large enough so they would look pixelated because we would be stretching them past their their natural width Michael said you could set the image of the the width max in a max width of the image to entitle to 50% so their line image with position and the other secondary text next to it then below them both props name across oh yeah I'm gonna have to try out some different things albert asks how much would you charge your project that would only take you like at most three days I have an idea for a nice little website done and react firebase cloud and stripe I don't know so I guess the first thing is like a project that would only take three days I want it like I would I prefer to break it down by more like by hour if possible because I find that to be more accurate also in general and this is for any bug when you go to take a project assume you're gonna work on it a lot more than you a first estimate but maybe after you if you've been working for a long time you get really good at estimating then it'll be okay but generally like at least double how many hours you think it's gonna take and then consider like how much is my time really worth so at at this point I'm very busy so I know like any extra time that I take is gonna be time away from my kids it's gonna make my wife really upset because that means she is gonna have to not be able to do she wants to do because she's gonna have to watch all the kids and make sure that I have the you know the time to do the work so in fact during all of that in I'm gonna say like basically I'm I'm not interested in doing any work for you know anything less than I don't let's just say to make it a nice number a hundred dollars an hour one hundred US dollars right because it's just gonna be a lot it's gonna be a lot more stress a lot to deal with like you know potentially depending on the deadline like it could mess with my exercise schedule and I mean there's just a lot I plan on having to work overtime right now at work anyway from my project so that's what I'm saying so let's say a project is going to take three days let's assume I only worked eight hours a day on that project which is like a normal workday so what that's 20 18 24 yeah 24 I can't do basic math on live streaming so let's just call it let's just say $50 or 50 hours let's assume I'm going to take 50 hours to do this project in reality then at $100 an hour like there's there's your price right so yeah so I mean that's that's what it is and I think people sometimes are shocked by the price of these types of projects but realistically like it's it's highly skilled work and especially if it's work on top of what somebody's already doing then you gotta value that more I mean even at least here in the United States even like government workers who are doing manual labor which I was doing I did that for six years just manual labor work for the government and you know when we would work overtime we got paid we call it a time and a half so like if I made let's say you know five dollars an hour then I would make seven dollars and fifty cents an hour when I got into overtime so like that extra time is the set is worth more so anyway that's my answer my long answer to that question is realistically I would probably charge five thousand dollars for site even if you think it's only gonna take three days I guarantee it will take more than three days and now like I said that's assuming we're talking eight hours a day for three days right that's you know if we're really talking like okay I'm gonna work two hours on it every day and it's only gonna take three days then it's a lot less money right but yeah and that's me there may be other people that are in a different situation may be willing to take a lot less when I had a lot less experience like five years ago like five years ago when I started out I started before I didn't I knew barely anything I knew like no JavaScript very very basic CSS and HTML I worked for $10 an hour I didn't stay at $10 an hour for very long maybe like the first three months I was willing to work for $10 an hour after that I was never willing to work for that again but that that's how I started so I certainly was not as good I couldn't do this stuff then and it took me way longer to do the same thing so that's it's kind of another thing like you can always find somebody cheaper and depending on what you want that may be fine but you know you should realize one you're not gonna get as good of a product and it's going to take that person longer so if you are paying them by the hour realize that it's going to take them longer you so there's just so many factors that go into that and so when you're trying to price your your labor like really think about what like realistically what is it gonna mean for your lifestyle and for your family or you know your friends you know whoever is close to you what is that gonna mean for them what kind of hardship is that gonna be for them and and price accordingly the other way to price is how much value am I going to add to this company or this product and that's certainly a good price so for you you can think of how much you need to get paid but when you're explaining it to a client explain it in terms of how much money am I gonna make for you when this product goes live or how much money will you save when I do these improvements things like that so I wouldn't go in to a client and explain like what I just said to you you know in terms of well my wife is gonna have to watch the kids and all this stuff clients if they're nice people they might care but it doesn't really matter to their business what they want to hear is how is this gonna make me more money how is it going to make my the lives of my workers or my clients easier how's it gonna make me more efficient at what I do things like that Michael Carrillo says forgetting your wife's github username is worse than forgetting her birthday haha I'm gonna tell that to my wife and see what she says Phoenix says Becca is your wife she is one of my fave moms who code Twitter handles I never knew this until now coder family goes no way she'll be so happy when I tell her that she was actually really discouraged this morning I gave her like a pep talk well part of the reason she was too scared she was mad at me over me not letting her have enough time to code but then also she was discouraged in thinking like that she wouldn't be able to get a job too so stuff like that will really help keep her keep her positive so I mean I have my own issues with depression that get me down but she's working through things too like I'm not gonna give all her details away whatever you know if she wants to discuss things on her blog that's fine but like essentially like she's dealing with issues from traumatic things that happened regarding like the birth of our last child and so that that's still affecting her both mentally and physically so comments like that to my wife I think really really helped her so if anybody does know my wife you follow her on Twitter or anything like that please make sure you you know let her know if you appreciate what she's doing because you know sometimes she needs some encouragement we all need encouragement you know Frankie says blogging it's or the new magazines of our time oh yeah for short they need to make it's amazing anybody can set up a blog you know basically for nothing and yeah it's it's just it's great I mean there's it's hard to find like is this person worth reading I don't want to say that people aren't worth reading but like you know what I mean like figuring out who really is an expert on what you're trying to find out you know everybody's story has value but there's only so much time in the day so you're gonna find what's right but it is amazing that everybody has oh my a lot I shouldn't say everybody there are people that don't have access to the Internet and things like that but a lot of people have the ability to express themselves like that and that's that's just awesome so trying to get through this live chat all John says nikki has some great wellwritten content on his blog I'll need to check it out all right yeah for sure what was I thought I saw him put the link to that in the in the chat off to scroll back through later on and find it and check it out cuz I haven't seen it yet Aniki says I thought of something I can add browser extensions that are handy for developers yeah that's a great idea all right Matthew says got a passing grade on my first frontend nanodegree project awesome so cool I'm very happy for you congratulations that's cool my wife I think just turned in her first project as well so I don't know if she got feedback yet she may have gotten it today while I'm working and I didn't hear about it yet but really cool Jones says if those cars are styled as display flex the width is determined from the image with yet but you know what John I think since the image is in that container that we brought in from the original markup I think it's messing it's messing that up also we I modified those cards as well so if maybe if I go back to doing a CSS background image so and use the card basically as intended by materialized or material UI maybe it'll solve so I there's a lot of different things I want to try so we'll see how it goes I don't know if I'll spend another stream on this or not it might start to get boring but we'll see I'll definitely show you all what the end result is and if I forget to show you just remind me world session the names on the card start with dr. yes for sure for sure they should Matthew says that's good advice my personal deadlines are always off yeah I assume you were talking about doubling the amount of time you think it's going to take yeah and I recommend when you're working on projects keep track of how long everything takes you you know like monitor your Pomodoro sessions things like that and that will help you to estimate later on yeah you can you can look back on previous projects and see like okay when I did this very similar thing it took me this long you know it's hard to just remember that you know when when a client asked like how long is this gonna take I'm it's almost impossible to accurately just rattle off a number you know you really need to go back in and study the data that you've already you know collected that you already put for each project for the amount of time how much it actually takes you to work on it and then base your estimates off of that and even then I would I would estimate a little more like if you intend to do anything new then it's going to take you longer than you think to really learn it world says who makes $5 an hour let me when I started working the first year I ever worked I worked for the city government and from the city I grew up in which is weird in West Virginia I worked for four dollars and seventy five cents an hour and that was what I made and I'm not gonna lie before that was actually before I could legally work so I had to get paid in cash I did work in some places where I made $2 an hour so it definitely happens it happens people work for that and I'm sure there are people that worked for way less than that still all right Albert says thanks I'll hit you up with more details to see how much our you think it's going to take for the website yeah no problem Tyron it's Tyr oh and I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that right but anyway they say I know some JavaScript and I want to break into JavaScript frameworks etc but I just don't feel confident enough yet what are your thoughts that may help I'm gonna say kind of a similar answer that I gave earlier in the stream just try it out use create react app do like an intro a demo to react even the react documentation I believe starts you out with a really basic intro project and I think they use create react app for that if you're not familiar with what that is it's just something that helps you get started working with react and it actually starts you off with a complete working react project that's just very basic like a hello world you know project and so you start with something that already works and you can edit that so I find that very helpful just you know just start see how you like it see if it's too overwhelming for you you can always do something else but you know I would say don't don't think about it too much in terms of like wondering about it you know just jump in do some code like the only what are you going to lose you're gonna lose a little bit space on your computer for when you download all those node modules right and that's it and if that's not your thing you can always just delete it and move on you know you'll you'll miss you'll lose out on a few hours of your life I guess but I'd say just go for it alright and Matthew said thanks Jess you're welcome no problem all right finally got to the end of the chat this has been nearly two and a half hours of live stream Oh awesome I did pronounce them correctly I'm alright I'm really happy and for anybody if I ever do pronounce your name incorrectly please let me know I I would I really want to be respectful of how you want your net your name to be pronounced so let me know it's it's not an inconvenience for me at all to be corrected I definitely I want that so alright finally I'm gonna go get something to eat what's today alright so Mars Friday so us for Friday tomorrow I'll be working from home oh I'm gonna do my best to try to stream I'm not gonna lie when I work from home it's always harder to to shrink for some reason well number one the streams don't go as well because I don't have as good of internet or equipment but also like it's more comfortable at home and when you're comfortable it's easier to stay comfortable and just keep on coding and not like you start to do something else like like streaming so anyway but I'm gonna do my best to try to stream tomorrow I'll let you all know on Twitter on Instagram and through the notifications on YouTube if they work what time I will stream and so and so then have a wonderful day
