00:00 - hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30
00:02 - days today's day number 29 and we're
00:04 - going to just do something a little
00:06 - simple we're going to be creating a
00:09 - blurry depth of field
00:11 - blur your images unblur your images
00:13 - effect whatever we want to call it
00:15 - essentially you can make
00:17 - images and elements blurry and
00:19 - transition in and out of that blurred
00:21 - effect to whatever degree that you wish
00:24 - with just css3 now typically before
00:26 - you'd have to do this with
00:28 - photoshop
00:29 - or maybe even like a jquery plugin or
00:31 - something like that but we can do that
00:33 - in css3 and it's really cool now it's
00:36 - quite simple in its you know in its
00:39 - basic form but you can do a lot with it
00:41 - if you had layered elements and you
00:43 - wanted certain elements to be blurry in
00:44 - the background and certain ones be to be
00:46 - focused in the front
00:48 - like a legitimate depth of field effect
00:50 - where your your focus point is on a
00:54 - specific layer and then the other ones
00:56 - come in and out of focus you can play
00:58 - around with that but in this case i'm
01:00 - gonna show you just simply how the blur
01:02 - effect works and we're just gonna to
01:04 - blur and unblur and transition in and
01:06 - out of that with css3 so here we go day
01:09 - 29 the blurry effect so we just have
01:11 - four images here that are just
01:14 - standard stock images
01:16 - but down here what we're going to do is
01:18 - we're going to
01:19 - have them start out as blurry once we
01:21 - kind of hover in view
01:24 - and then when you focus on one it will
01:26 - kind of come forward and be it within
01:28 - focus with the other ones be being
01:30 - blurry in the background when we hover
01:31 - out of that it should go back to its
01:33 - blurred state and we can also hover to a
01:35 - different one it will switch and now
01:37 - that one is in focus this one is in
01:39 - focus this one is in focus
01:41 - a good uh practical example or practical
01:43 - use of this specific demo would be
01:46 - um perhaps portfolio images or a gallery
01:50 - of images now the blur effect here is
01:52 - quite dramatic now you don't have to
01:56 - have it be that
01:58 - dramatic of a blurred effect but maybe
02:00 - in some cases that might be what you
02:01 - want so let's jump into our code editor
02:04 - download day number 29 and then as you
02:06 - can see in our markup here
02:09 - uh we simply just have four images
02:11 - there's nothing crazy about this at all
02:13 - it's quite simple
02:14 - head to your sandbox and let's start
02:17 - coding so
02:19 - we're gonna select the depth gallery
02:22 - that is the div that wraps the four
02:24 - images and we're simply just going to
02:26 - position relative and then display
02:28 - inline block
02:31 - then we're going to select the depth
02:33 - gallery image
02:35 - so all the images we're gonna give them
02:37 - a border of solid
02:39 - let's do eight pixels or seven doesn't
02:42 - really matter
02:44 - white
02:46 - box shadow
02:48 - we're to go 0 0 5 pixels
02:51 - and then rgba
02:54 - 0 0 0 and then 0.3
02:58 - and then we'll say cursor pointer
03:01 - because we're hovering over it we want
03:02 - that interaction
03:04 - you don't have to you can change it to
03:06 - crosshair let's do that that'd be fun
03:09 - and we're going to say transition
03:11 - we're going to transition the filter
03:13 - property because we're going to be using
03:15 - css3 filter property i'll show you in a
03:17 - moment here 0.3 seconds linear we're
03:20 - also going to transition the transform
03:23 - property at 0.3 seconds and linear as
03:27 - well
03:29 - save
03:30 - that
03:32 - now if you go to our browser you can see
03:34 - the images now have a nice little
03:38 - like a nice border a white a white
03:40 - border around it with a little bit of a
03:42 - shadow it's just a nice
03:44 - a nice way of displaying an image just
03:47 - makes it look nice
03:49 - gives it a frame
03:51 - now we're gonna go back here we're gonna
03:52 - say depth
03:54 - gallery
03:55 - hover when you hover over the entire
03:57 - depth gallery
03:59 - and then image so when you hover over
04:01 - that element the entire pyramint element
04:04 - parent element
04:05 - do something with the images
04:08 - and that's simply going to be filter
04:10 - so we can apply some graphical effects
04:12 - we're going to say blur
04:14 - and then 5 pixels so that's how you do
04:17 - that that's how you blur an image check
04:18 - it out
04:19 - so when i hover it in there so i'm out
04:22 - of the element itself when i hover into
04:24 - that element
04:25 - it's going to blur everything 5 pixels
04:26 - now you can have it be more exaggerated
04:28 - or less exaggerated by changing the
04:30 - value higher or lower
04:32 - this is one pixel
04:34 - very subtle
04:36 - and if i did 10 pixels you can't even
04:38 - recognize what the image is really
04:41 - so there we go i'm going to stick with
04:44 - let's say 4 pixels
04:47 - and i'm going to transform it
04:50 - and i'm going to use the scale value
04:53 - here
04:54 - and scale is simply just the size the
04:55 - scale of it don't want to be
04:58 - one would equal
04:59 - it's not going to do anything it's going
05:00 - to be its
05:02 - normal size 0.9 is 90 of its size both
05:06 - height and width you can have it be 2
05:08 - and it'll be twice the size so you can
05:10 - scale an element any element using
05:12 - transform scale save it now when i hover
05:15 - into the depth gallery
05:19 - everything shrinks point nine and goes
05:21 - blurry to four pixel blur effect
05:25 - okay
05:26 - and the only thing we have to do now is
05:28 - when you hover over say depth gallery
05:32 - image and then hover over an individual
05:33 - image we're going to filter we're going
05:35 - to overwrite that filter property and
05:37 - blur to zero so just back to a standard
05:40 - in focus image transform
05:44 - scale and then 1.1 and because we're
05:47 - transitioning
05:49 - the images everything is
05:51 - got a nice kind of fluid transition in
05:53 - between so save it now let's check it
05:55 - out we hover it in everything goes down
05:57 - to 0.9 and goes blurry you hover over
05:59 - one
06:00 - comes up into focus
06:02 - and is a little bit larger
06:05 - when you hover out onto a different one
06:07 - one goes back one comes forward nice
06:10 - and simple
06:12 - so that's it for today's demo
06:14 - for the blurry effect we simply played
06:17 - around with filters
06:19 - the filter blur and the transform scale
06:21 - you could do everything from
06:22 - transforming and rotating upon that uh
06:25 - when you hover but because this was
06:27 - about blurring images we're simply using
06:29 - the filter blur effect i challenge you
06:33 - to take this a little bit further i
06:34 - showed you how to use the blur and
06:36 - transition in between in focus and
06:38 - everything like that but i challenge you
06:40 - to do something exciting with this maybe
06:43 - have the images individually be stacked
06:46 - in front of each other have them be
06:47 - cascading out in front of each other so
06:50 - you could see an image and then one in
06:51 - front and a little bit down another one
06:53 - in front and a little bit down and so on
06:54 - and so forth and when you hover over
06:56 - that image you know maybe pop it out of
06:59 - like a deck of cards and have it come in
07:01 - focus and the other ones go blurry or
07:03 - maybe you you have separate individual
07:06 - png transparent elements like a scene
07:08 - you have maybe three trees or something
07:11 - like that and when you hover over one
07:13 - tree that one's in focus you hover over
07:15 - this one it's in focus the other two are
07:17 - blurry almost like if you're a
07:18 - photographer
07:20 - and you're you're photographing someone
07:22 - and you want to
07:24 - put a certain element in focus and have
07:27 - you know the background be blurry and
07:28 - the foreground be blurry but this one
07:30 - single plane of focus that's kind of
07:33 - what you're doing here so i challenge
07:34 - you to
07:35 - experiment with this and don't just
07:37 - leave it here i've given you the tool
07:39 - and now i want you to play with it a bit
07:41 - so see what you can come up with and i
07:42 - will see you in
07:44 - tomorrow's final lesson day number 30.
07:48 - so i'll see you there
07:49 - and have fun with the blur effect cheers

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today's day number 29 and we're going to just do something a little simple we're going to be creating a blurry depth of field blur your images unblur your images effect whatever we want to call it essentially you can make images and elements blurry and transition in and out of that blurred effect to whatever degree that you wish with just css3 now typically before you'd have to do this with photoshop or maybe even like a jquery plugin or something like that but we can do that in css3 and it's really cool now it's quite simple in its you know in its basic form but you can do a lot with it if you had layered elements and you wanted certain elements to be blurry in the background and certain ones be to be focused in the front like a legitimate depth of field effect where your your focus point is on a specific layer and then the other ones come in and out of focus you can play around with that but in this case i'm gonna show you just simply how the blur effect works and we're just gonna to blur and unblur and transition in and out of that with css3 so here we go day 29 the blurry effect so we just have four images here that are just standard stock images but down here what we're going to do is we're going to have them start out as blurry once we kind of hover in view and then when you focus on one it will kind of come forward and be it within focus with the other ones be being blurry in the background when we hover out of that it should go back to its blurred state and we can also hover to a different one it will switch and now that one is in focus this one is in focus this one is in focus a good uh practical example or practical use of this specific demo would be um perhaps portfolio images or a gallery of images now the blur effect here is quite dramatic now you don't have to have it be that dramatic of a blurred effect but maybe in some cases that might be what you want so let's jump into our code editor download day number 29 and then as you can see in our markup here uh we simply just have four images there's nothing crazy about this at all it's quite simple head to your sandbox and let's start coding so we're gonna select the depth gallery that is the div that wraps the four images and we're simply just going to position relative and then display inline block then we're going to select the depth gallery image so all the images we're gonna give them a border of solid let's do eight pixels or seven doesn't really matter white box shadow we're to go 0 0 5 pixels and then rgba 0 0 0 and then 0.3 and then we'll say cursor pointer because we're hovering over it we want that interaction you don't have to you can change it to crosshair let's do that that'd be fun and we're going to say transition we're going to transition the filter property because we're going to be using css3 filter property i'll show you in a moment here 0.3 seconds linear we're also going to transition the transform property at 0.3 seconds and linear as well save that now if you go to our browser you can see the images now have a nice little like a nice border a white a white border around it with a little bit of a shadow it's just a nice a nice way of displaying an image just makes it look nice gives it a frame now we're gonna go back here we're gonna say depth gallery hover when you hover over the entire depth gallery and then image so when you hover over that element the entire pyramint element parent element do something with the images and that's simply going to be filter so we can apply some graphical effects we're going to say blur and then 5 pixels so that's how you do that that's how you blur an image check it out so when i hover it in there so i'm out of the element itself when i hover into that element it's going to blur everything 5 pixels now you can have it be more exaggerated or less exaggerated by changing the value higher or lower this is one pixel very subtle and if i did 10 pixels you can't even recognize what the image is really so there we go i'm going to stick with let's say 4 pixels and i'm going to transform it and i'm going to use the scale value here and scale is simply just the size the scale of it don't want to be one would equal it's not going to do anything it's going to be its normal size 0.9 is 90 of its size both height and width you can have it be 2 and it'll be twice the size so you can scale an element any element using transform scale save it now when i hover into the depth gallery everything shrinks point nine and goes blurry to four pixel blur effect okay and the only thing we have to do now is when you hover over say depth gallery image and then hover over an individual image we're going to filter we're going to overwrite that filter property and blur to zero so just back to a standard in focus image transform scale and then 1.1 and because we're transitioning the images everything is got a nice kind of fluid transition in between so save it now let's check it out we hover it in everything goes down to 0.9 and goes blurry you hover over one comes up into focus and is a little bit larger when you hover out onto a different one one goes back one comes forward nice and simple so that's it for today's demo for the blurry effect we simply played around with filters the filter blur and the transform scale you could do everything from transforming and rotating upon that uh when you hover but because this was about blurring images we're simply using the filter blur effect i challenge you to take this a little bit further i showed you how to use the blur and transition in between in focus and everything like that but i challenge you to do something exciting with this maybe have the images individually be stacked in front of each other have them be cascading out in front of each other so you could see an image and then one in front and a little bit down another one in front and a little bit down and so on and so forth and when you hover over that image you know maybe pop it out of like a deck of cards and have it come in focus and the other ones go blurry or maybe you you have separate individual png transparent elements like a scene you have maybe three trees or something like that and when you hover over one tree that one's in focus you hover over this one it's in focus the other two are blurry almost like if you're a photographer and you're you're photographing someone and you want to put a certain element in focus and have you know the background be blurry and the foreground be blurry but this one single plane of focus that's kind of what you're doing here so i challenge you to experiment with this and don't just leave it here i've given you the tool and now i want you to play with it a bit so see what you can come up with and i will see you in tomorrow's final lesson day number 30. so i'll see you there and have fun with the blur effect cheers
