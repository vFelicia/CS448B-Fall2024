00:00 - map is used to run a function upon each
00:03 - item in an iterable item like a list and
00:06 - create a new list with the same number
00:08 - of items but the values of each item can
00:11 - be changed so here's an example we have
00:14 - this list and then here's the function
00:17 - and then we are going to map through
00:20 - each item in the list and so here's the
00:24 - function we're going to run we're going
00:25 - to run this function on each item in the
00:28 - list and now we're going to get a new
00:31 - list so I can do print
00:33 - result so then we can always just pass
00:37 - it into the
00:39 - list function
00:41 - and then we can run the program again
00:44 - two four six so one two three became two
00:47 - for six so yeah whenever you want to do
00:49 - run a function on each item in a list
00:51 - you can use map
