00:07 - hey everybody
00:08 - uh welcome to live coding with jesse i'm
00:11 - jesse and i am trying to stream from
00:14 - home again today
00:17 - so
00:19 - i got my internet upgraded
00:21 - and i made some changes to my settings
00:25 - on obs
00:28 - but i'm still getting
00:30 - occasionally
00:33 - some some issues so
00:35 - let me know uh on your end
00:38 - how this this looks what kind of quality
00:40 - are you getting
00:42 - um
00:44 - and and we'll see i um
00:46 - there's still a few more things that i
00:48 - could try
00:49 - so
00:50 - if it gets bad
00:53 - you know it may be able to fix it
00:58 - but today
01:01 - we are going to
01:03 - work on that search page that we were
01:05 - working on yesterday
01:07 - so yesterday we worked on
01:09 - styling
01:11 - the search bar
01:13 - and
01:14 - we styled
01:16 - the sorting drop down
01:19 - and the um
01:21 - the filters the checkbox filters so
01:24 - i don't know if style would be the right
01:25 - word we um
01:27 - we arranged them differently uh so we
01:30 - laid it out differently so today i'd
01:31 - like to focus on
01:33 - uh
01:34 - styling the actual results
01:38 - so right now they look a mess and i'll
01:40 - switch over to them
01:42 - now because i think i look a mess the
01:43 - only thing i do want to show you when
01:45 - i'm in this view is
01:46 - uh
01:47 - my cool shirt so
01:50 - i get this shirt uh from my grandma at
01:54 - christmas time
01:55 - powered by ramen so anyway i'm a ramen
01:58 - fan
02:01 - um
02:07 - let me switch over now
02:09 - okay
02:11 - cool now we'll be able to see the code
02:13 - i'm gonna make it a bit bigger
02:16 - and i was working on the routing i i did
02:19 - make some pretty uh interesting changes
02:23 - to the routing function so
02:25 - if you want to check out
02:27 - what i've done
02:29 - uh look at the last thing that was let's
02:33 - see if i did this give push
02:38 - all right so i just now pushed these
02:39 - changes so the last commit that is
02:41 - pushed up to the repo
02:43 - uh has some changes to be able to handle
02:45 - some different situations uh
02:47 - particularly when we have two parameters
02:49 - for our routing in our server.js file so
02:52 - i added a lot of comments to try to make
02:55 - it easier to understand
02:57 - so someone can ask me at the end of the
02:59 - stream if you want me to go through this
03:00 - i'm not going to right now
03:03 - but hopefully the comments will help you
03:06 - if you want to check it out on your own
03:07 - the link to the repo should be in
03:10 - the description
03:12 - all right so let's go over
03:16 - and go over to the search page
03:20 - i've been slowly going through every
03:23 - link i could find on every page and
03:25 - making sure that
03:27 - the data slugs are correct in wordpress
03:30 - and that the the router handles it
03:33 - correctly so
03:34 - it's just been
03:36 - uh it it's kind of slow going because
03:39 - occasionally i'll run into something and
03:40 - i'm like are you serious that url is
03:43 - why why is it like that
03:45 - and then i'll have to go back and that's
03:46 - why i had to
03:48 - add some logic into the router
03:51 - to handle this case that i had found
03:55 - all right so we're going to go on to the
03:56 - search page
03:59 - and
04:00 - every one thing i i have noticed and we
04:03 - noticed a little bit the last time i
04:04 - tried to stream from home is that
04:06 - everything is slower
04:08 - uh so even if the stream is okay
04:11 - everything else on this machine is
04:13 - slower
04:14 - so
04:16 - if it gets too bad
04:20 - i may end up
04:22 - either using a different machine
04:24 - completely
04:26 - i have a windows desktop that might be
04:28 - better
04:29 - or
04:31 - it's possible
04:34 - and um
04:35 - the guy i believe was it matthew
04:38 - yeah i think his name was matthew
04:40 - who would help i mentioned yesterday it
04:42 - helped me out he said that it's possible
04:44 - to run
04:46 - obs on a completely different machine
04:50 - network as my laptop and then all the
04:52 - streaming stuff would be handled by that
04:54 - machine and then i would just
04:57 - handle
04:58 - uh the
04:59 - you know actually building the stuff
05:01 - so that might be the best
05:03 - solution i just need to get that all set
05:06 - up on the other computer which currently
05:08 - is on the other side of my house right
05:11 - now so i have to figure some way to make
05:14 - that work
05:16 - okay
05:20 - all right blake uh hey everybody i see
05:22 - you in the in the chat here so blake
05:24 - asks for a speed test uh yeah maybe
05:26 - we'll do a speed test later on remind me
05:28 - towards the the end of the stream or on
05:30 - the next break
05:31 - about doing a speed test it's not
05:34 - spectacular the best internet i can get
05:36 - here is uh 25 on the upload and or 25 on
05:41 - the download and 5 on the upload
05:44 - uh so
05:45 - still not great but i even asked like do
05:47 - you have anything else and i said no
05:50 - that's the the highest we can go so
05:53 - so that's what we have
05:56 - literally the best money can buy all for
05:59 - the stream
06:01 - nikki says speed test while streaming is
06:03 - not a good idea okay yeah good call so
06:06 - anyway those are i'll tell you what the
06:08 - results of my speed test were after i
06:10 - upgraded um i think i was getting like a
06:13 - little over three on the upload
06:16 - and the download was some it was like
06:18 - 17. so
06:21 - you know how that works you never really
06:22 - get what they what they say
06:26 - all right so we do have the search
06:28 - uh page up now and i'm gonna start my
06:32 - pomodoro timer we're going to do a
06:34 - 25-minute pomodoro session
06:37 - where we code
06:38 - after that we'll take a five-minute
06:40 - break and i'll answer any questions that
06:42 - are in the live chat and we're just
06:44 - going to go back and forth we'll do two
06:45 - pomodoro sessions today um unless for
06:49 - some reason we just fly through this and
06:53 - make everything look perfect within the
06:55 - first 25 minutes
06:57 - uh then when we do one
06:59 - and then at the end
07:00 - i'll take all the rest of the time to
07:03 - answer questions
07:06 - and
07:07 - let's see
07:10 - i'm just checking what's in the chat
07:11 - right now
07:13 - all right great so it seems like the
07:15 - stream's doing well i've got no weird
07:17 - messages about it uh from obs
07:20 - so
07:21 - let me check
07:23 - yeah uh most of the users are getting
07:26 - 720p so mostly you're getting 720p which
07:30 - is great that's what i'm shooting for
07:32 - all right
07:34 - i think this is doable
07:38 - so let's search for something i keep
07:40 - searching for biology so why not just
07:42 - keep going and search for biology all
07:44 - right
07:45 - so
07:49 - why did anthropology come up immediately
07:51 - when i searched biology
07:54 - i don't know i guess the word biology
07:56 - must be in there somewhere
07:58 - so here's our search results i'll zoom
08:00 - in
08:02 - so right now we're getting the category
08:04 - which is major
08:06 - although i talked to my boss and
08:08 - evidently
08:10 - it's it's really
08:11 - the department and not necessarily the
08:14 - major
08:15 - uh
08:16 - so
08:18 - the title on the current website said
08:21 - major departments or department majors
08:24 - or something like that there was or no
08:26 - programs i'm sorry these are programs so
08:28 - they said major programs
08:31 - so
08:33 - i think we're gonna go with calling them
08:34 - programs instead
08:36 - for now i'm gonna stick with majors
08:38 - because there's no sense in me changing
08:40 - everything unless i'm 100 sure
08:44 - so anyway the categories is major we see
08:47 - here here's a category for department so
08:50 - we're displaying categories we're
08:51 - displaying the date
08:54 - which we may or may not even want to
08:56 - display i just needed this displayed
08:58 - when we were testing our sorting
09:01 - and then the title
09:05 - we had talked weeks ago about also
09:08 - displaying
09:09 - a a small description
09:11 - i don't
09:13 - i don't know that that's the best idea
09:15 - right now because there's a lot of
09:17 - pieces of content that don't have either
09:20 - don't have a description or worse
09:22 - they have a really weird description
09:26 - that's
09:27 - formatted weird it has strange html tags
09:30 - in it and even if we remove the html
09:32 - tags it would look even worse
09:34 - so
09:36 - i don't think we can do that now
09:39 - so the first thing we're going to do is
09:41 - just make it look good with the category
09:44 - and
09:45 - the title
09:48 - potentially the dates
09:51 - uh the dates really don't matter right
09:53 - now though because a lot of the content
09:56 - came over and they'll all have like the
09:57 - date when it was imported over to the
10:00 - new database and not the actual publish
10:02 - date
10:03 - so
10:06 - i don't know we'll see
10:08 - uh so i think that's all we're gonna
10:10 - have right now for the search results
10:12 - it's gonna be a little bear
10:15 - at some point it'd be great to get
10:19 - reasonable
10:20 - excerpts and descriptions for each
10:23 - page that comes up in these results
10:25 - but that's
10:27 - it just depends on you know who i can
10:29 - get
10:30 - to do that i mean i certainly don't
10:32 - think it's a good use of my time to go
10:33 - through and try to write that right now
10:37 - um
10:39 - all right so let's do that
10:41 - i don't really have any
10:43 - inspiration that i'm going with here or
10:45 - any vision in my head so i'm just gonna
10:49 - we're just gonna like
10:51 - get this design going as we go so i'm
10:53 - open to
10:54 - uh to any suggestions that you all have
11:00 - uh
11:00 - yeah uh angie
11:03 - says uh
11:05 - excited to watch this i've never done a
11:07 - code with me uh before i'm such a noob
11:10 - don't worry about it we're
11:13 - i i'm a noob too at many things so um
11:16 - i'm glad that you're here in the live
11:18 - chat feel free to ask any questions uh
11:20 - that uh that pop up i'm happy to go over
11:23 - anything
11:24 - um if um i'm being confused or anything
11:27 - like that
11:28 - all right so let's pull out this date
11:31 - first that'll do a lot to clean it up
11:33 - because the state's ugly
11:35 - uh we'll go over to the code let me know
11:38 - if this code is not big enough i may
11:40 - have to go bigger than normal because
11:43 - i can't get 1080p quality
11:46 - at home
11:47 - where are we at search
11:50 - and
11:51 - i'm gonna
11:53 - get rid of as much as i can
12:01 - okay
12:03 - so
12:04 - here's where we're
12:06 - should be below
12:09 - right
12:13 - oh no i yeah we moved our check boxes
12:15 - below the um
12:19 - the results okay so here's our results
12:23 - so here's the actual markup
12:26 - uh and we just used some divs we didn't
12:27 - even use any material ui components
12:30 - for right now i think this is okay
12:34 - uh i
12:35 - i don't think i want to make cards for
12:38 - each one of these
12:40 - we can try it if whatever we come up
12:43 - with right now doesn't really look great
12:44 - we can try to do cards but
12:47 - i don't think
12:49 - i think it'll just look cleaner like
12:51 - this so we'll see see how it goes so
12:53 - let's pull out the date
12:55 - right now
12:56 - we'll get rid of that
12:58 - if we do add it back in later we'll
13:00 - definitely make it look a lot nicer than
13:03 - it did
13:05 - we currently have
13:07 - where's this
13:09 - the type here
13:11 - let's see
13:13 - the type is a slightly different color
13:15 - it's a little bit gray but
13:20 - it might not be a bad idea to make this
13:25 - an entirely different color to maybe
13:28 - have it stand out a bit more
13:33 - so let's let's see what color should we
13:35 - like this
13:37 - um let's see what color we have we can
13:39 - make it this gold color
13:40 - let's see what it looks like with the
13:42 - gold
13:45 - and
13:46 - so we already have
13:48 - the classes uh type on here so we could
13:51 - just add to that class i think that's
13:53 - what we'll do
14:02 - all the way up
14:04 - to where we have type
14:08 - and
14:09 - let's go with color
14:13 - and
14:15 - yes what color do we have is it like
14:18 - theme
14:23 - i don't i'm not sure exactly what it's
14:24 - called but let's try
14:27 - theme
14:29 - api
14:30 - oops not api i don't know what i'm
14:32 - thinking
14:33 - theme
14:34 - color
14:37 - uh
14:38 - secondary
14:43 - let's see if that works and i forgot a
14:45 - comma that's why i'm getting that red
14:47 - error line
15:00 - um
15:02 - nikki says if a different color that
15:04 - same yellow is a student profile yes i
15:07 - thought about that
15:09 - did anything happen
15:11 - no nothing happened
15:18 - i wonder if we're using that
15:23 - i may have to look up
15:27 - what that is supposed to be
15:29 - i wonder if it'll give me
15:34 - um
15:37 - i guess we can look at material ui
15:44 - documentation
15:48 - and nikki i think you're right we could
15:50 - go with that color uh but i want to see
15:52 - how the gold looks so i i know
15:56 - that yellow sometimes is a bit hard
16:00 - uh to
16:01 - to make out on
16:04 - especially uh on older monitors so
16:08 - if the if the gold looks okay i think
16:11 - i'm gonna go with the gold
16:12 - and then we may end up changing the
16:15 - cards as well on the home page
16:19 - secondary all right yeah that was
16:20 - undefined
16:27 - all right
16:38 - hopefully it'll tell us
16:45 - primary
16:51 - palette okay maybe we gotta go palette
16:53 - then
16:54 - uh so we'll go theme palette secondary
16:59 - see if that works
17:14 - no it didn't look right
17:17 - secondary
17:18 - all right that looks better
17:21 - let's try it now
17:23 - see what we have
17:31 - should be getting a refresh soon
17:35 - i guess while i'm waiting for the
17:36 - refresh i'm gonna look back in here oh
17:39 - angie says is this a class with the font
17:42 - settings on its own
17:44 - um
17:48 - yeah so
17:50 - angie i'm not sure how much you know
17:51 - about react so this is probably gonna
17:54 - look weird let me see
18:00 - okay uh john i see john's already
18:02 - answered so
18:03 - i'll just kind of add to that
18:06 - as well
18:07 - so
18:08 - in react one of the ways you can do
18:10 - styles is to make a javascript object
18:13 - with css like
18:16 - properties so you can see this is it
18:18 - looks kind of like css but we're doing
18:19 - some stuff like with camel casing
18:22 - so
18:23 - i am just making a class called type
18:25 - basically and i'm setting the color
18:28 - to
18:30 - whatever color we have saved basically
18:33 - uh in
18:35 - as as this so
18:37 - instead of putting the hex value like we
18:38 - normally would
18:41 - then um
18:43 - hey ambrose
18:45 - my
18:46 - my three-year-old is trying to
18:49 - trying to get over here ambrose we can't
18:51 - watch any shows right now i'm doing a
18:53 - live stream on youtube okay
19:00 - so um
19:01 - anyway so that's all we're doing you
19:03 - know very very similar to what we do
19:05 - normally with css just to add the color
19:08 - to the class
19:10 - so
19:11 - yay finally
19:17 - so let's search and see hmm
19:23 - did it not work
19:27 - let's check out what's going on here in
19:29 - devtools
19:31 - and see
19:32 - why
19:33 - it's not working for us
19:40 - if i need let's get rid of the console
19:43 - here at the bottom you don't need that
19:45 - but we do need
19:47 - this
19:49 - and let's
19:50 - move this over
19:55 - okay
19:56 - all right so it looks like our color
19:59 - is
20:00 - not working i messed something up
20:03 - where did i mess up
20:07 - theme palette secondary oh i know what i
20:10 - messed up
20:12 - check this out
20:14 - so secondary does return an object just
20:18 - just like it it says here i i was
20:20 - looking right at it and
20:23 - just didn't realize it so i need to add
20:24 - main
20:25 - in order to return a string
20:27 - i was trying i was
20:29 - pulling in this entire object which
20:31 - obviously
20:33 - you know you can't pass objects as
20:36 - css property uh values
20:40 - so let's go with main and that should
20:42 - give us like the color
20:44 - uh in the color palette that we want
20:51 - michael creole says ambrose in the house
20:54 - yeah it was ambrose was trying to come
20:56 - in
20:57 - um
20:59 - yeah ambrose has been sad all day
21:01 - because he just wants to sit here in my
21:03 - chair with me and he wants me to put my
21:05 - little pony on one of my monitors i have
21:07 - three monitors here
21:10 - oh okay so our secondary color is that
21:12 - yellow color interesting
21:17 - yeah that's really hard to read like
21:19 - that
21:20 - we could maybe change the font weight
21:22 - and it might be a bit better
21:26 - but anyway i've been
21:28 - what i've been doing i've actually been
21:30 - using all three monitors
21:32 - and so i said you know hey i i we can't
21:35 - watch it today
21:37 - so he's pretty sad
21:39 - uh
21:40 - i guess
21:42 - i guess this mom won't put on
21:45 - my little pony upstairs for him
21:49 - all right
21:50 - okay that's much easier to read
21:55 - what do you think about this should we
21:57 - try to go with
22:01 - the gold or should we leave it like this
22:06 - all right nikki says team gold is better
22:09 - than yellow
22:11 - uh kishore says hey jesse you didn't
22:13 - post the url for your live code
22:15 - um
22:18 - yeah you know what i didn't
22:20 - i didn't set up uh ngrok on this
22:23 - computer so i i forgot to set it up
22:28 - and by the time i thought about it today
22:29 - i just i ran out of time
22:32 - also i'm not sure if this computer can
22:34 - handle running it since it's so slow
22:35 - already so i'm gonna try to to work out
22:38 - a way to run ngrok from home
22:40 - but for now i do not have it so sorry
22:43 - about that
22:47 - john hanson says do we get a vote for my
22:49 - little pony
22:53 - yeah if if you are my little pony fans
22:55 - uh
22:56 - let me know what your favorite pony is
22:58 - in the live chat or in the comments
23:00 - below
23:01 - and
23:04 - it'll be a great discussion
23:06 - um
23:08 - all right oh n is here she says hey hey
23:10 - anna how's it going
23:19 - all right gold it looks like
23:21 - gold is
23:24 - pretty much what everybody wants i don't
23:26 - think i saw anybody vote for yellow
23:29 - okay
23:32 - i don't know what color this really is
23:34 - yup it's like yellowy orange but i've
23:37 - just been calling it yellow
23:39 - all right so let's switch it up and do
23:41 - this gold i
23:44 - i
23:45 - wonder if we should just make gold the
23:47 - secondary color in the theme
23:52 - because it seems like
23:53 - nobody's really a fan of this color at
23:56 - all
23:58 - so let's do that let's just switch up in
24:00 - the theme to gold
24:03 - and that'll be cool because we haven't
24:04 - really done any work or even looked at
24:07 - the the theme in
24:10 - i don't know probably since it was first
24:12 - put in there
24:13 - uh so let's go
24:16 - i don't even remember where it is
24:19 - let's check it out
24:21 - is it here
24:26 - yep there it is here's our theme
24:29 - so here's our secondary
24:36 - wait is this a real thing
24:47 - okay are 500 that's interesting
24:52 - it's interesting that maine actually
24:54 - worked
25:03 - that's really weird
25:09 - is there somewhere else
25:11 - let me think
25:29 - all right john says five percent darker
25:30 - the gold will be easier to read it i did
25:33 - i do have a darker version of it
25:37 - that i've used elsewhere that is a lot
25:39 - easier to read
25:42 - but now i'm
25:45 - i'm really puzzled here so let me
25:48 - i don't know if i explain why i'm
25:50 - puzzled so
25:51 - uh we saw
25:53 - you know we can see here
25:55 - that
25:57 - like we brought this in and we have our
25:59 - palette primary like light main dark
26:02 - right
26:03 - but over here
26:05 - what we're seeing is is really different
26:08 - than that
26:09 - it's it's not
26:11 - it's not showing us those options
26:13 - which i'm a little confused about
26:16 - because
26:18 - how did it work when we said maine if
26:21 - this is what
26:22 - we have so i'm wondering if we have
26:25 - something else
26:27 - somewhere
26:31 - let's see
26:47 - let's see
27:19 - okay nothing here
27:21 - it's the last place we could check is
27:24 - here
27:26 - see if we pulled anything in here
27:34 - i guess not
27:44 - all right so we are pulling from here
27:48 - lid fps
28:01 - yeah i mean this this is where it's
28:02 - pulling from
28:04 - okay
28:05 - well
28:08 - i guess it our the equivalent of main
28:11 - would be this 500
28:17 - so if we changed our 500 here
28:20 - maybe that would do something
28:23 - let's see what value we're getting right
28:24 - now
28:26 - i don't think it's that now this is a
28:28 - value
28:31 - you know what let me search for this
28:33 - value in our project and see if if it
28:35 - can come up so in visual studio code you
28:38 - can do a search throughout all the files
28:40 - in your project which is super helpful
28:43 - you can even do a replace
28:45 - that's how i um i ended up fixing a lot
28:48 - of the issues when we updated
28:51 - fus theme
28:54 - interesting
28:57 - okay so that's the color that we're
28:59 - getting here
29:09 - you know what i'm wondering i think it
29:11 - was harshit who did this
29:13 - uh i wonder if harshit took the main
29:16 - colors
29:18 - and um
29:20 - and then made all these
29:23 - variations
29:26 - i mean there's probably some tool that
29:28 - will make these variations for you
29:33 - that
29:34 - that might make more sense
29:41 - but since we see it here let's just
29:43 - let's try to manually change this
29:46 - to our
29:47 - our gold color which
29:51 - uh let me go my other screen and grab
29:53 - the hex value for that gold color
30:04 - so i do have
30:07 - an outdated style guide that i made
30:11 - over a year ago
30:13 - but it is useful to grab the hex codes
30:15 - so i'm looking at that right now
30:20 - and here we go
30:25 - all right so here's our hex code
30:31 - let's see if that makes a difference
30:36 - i mean it should be pretty obvious
30:39 - whether or not that's really where
30:41 - the color is coming from
30:43 - and if this doesn't work right now then
30:46 - i'm just going to put the hex code in
30:47 - manually
30:50 - and um
30:52 - just so that we can move on and see what
30:54 - it looks like
30:56 - i can always read through the
30:57 - documentation and material ui a little
30:59 - bit more later
31:01 - and
31:02 - you know try to add it into the theme
31:07 - that way
31:16 - okay
31:23 - hey it worked awesome
31:25 - all right so let's let's zoom out a bit
31:27 - and take a look at it
31:30 - so here's that gold color what do y'all
31:32 - think
31:33 - and i i realize i'm i'm not i'm missing
31:35 - things in the uh live chat now so
31:38 - uh
31:40 - i kind of couldn't keep up there so
31:42 - apologies if i
31:43 - am missing some advice but anyway you
31:46 - all can see the gold now my timer just
31:49 - went off so i'm gonna set the five
31:50 - minute timer and i'm gonna switch back
31:52 - to the screen so you can keep looking at
31:53 - the gold let me know what you think
32:06 - okay
32:10 - all right john says gold is gold is
32:12 - great angie said looking good all right
32:14 - cool
32:15 - cool cool
32:16 - when john says the color looks good i
32:19 - believe it right because john is an
32:21 - awesome artist so
32:23 - guaranteed he knows way more about
32:25 - colors and what looks good than than i
32:27 - do so
32:28 - um
32:30 - i'm gonna i'm gonna go with that who
32:32 - else uh
32:34 - nicole says yep that's good
32:37 - hey nicole how's it going
32:39 - uh
32:41 - welcome to the live chat so i think
32:42 - nicole and angie both i don't know that
32:45 - i've seen you in the live chat before
32:47 - apologies if you have been in the chat
32:49 - and i just didn't uh didn't see your
32:51 - message
32:52 - but uh if this is your first time
32:54 - chatting
32:55 - uh thank you and thanks for watching
33:01 - okay and john's saying you need that
33:02 - border top still okay yeah you're you're
33:04 - right we're gonna put in that border
33:07 - do you all remember on project one
33:10 - uh where we did those search listings we
33:13 - had a nice border
33:15 - uh who made that border
33:17 - shoot
33:18 - somebody in from the live chat did some
33:21 - work to make that border and i i
33:24 - modified it slightly
33:26 - but i can't remember now i mean
33:28 - obviously it shows who did it in github
33:30 - but
33:32 - uh anyway maybe we'll do something like
33:34 - that because i i really liked that
33:38 - border
33:39 - uh so
33:42 - all right cool we have um
33:44 - i think this is definitely better
33:46 - definitely an improvement so we're gonna
33:47 - keep that
33:48 - uh and this will match did we ever
33:50 - change these
33:52 - no we didn't so
33:54 - we may want if we're going with this
33:56 - color here we may want to think about
33:58 - you know do we want to change some
34:00 - colors here i'm gonna leave it for now
34:02 - but
34:03 - you know just some uh some options
34:07 - just got a message from work
34:10 - okay not really
34:12 - an issue
34:15 - okay
34:18 - and you know what i set that five minute
34:20 - timer and then didn't answer anything in
34:21 - the live chat so let me set that again
34:24 - because that's not fair
34:25 - to you all i'm gonna scroll up to the
34:27 - top of the chat try to get through as
34:29 - much as i can it looks like there's a
34:30 - lot in there so i may not be able to get
34:32 - to it all in this five minutes may have
34:33 - to wait till after the next session
34:39 - and
34:41 - let's see
34:48 - john says there he is bartholomew
34:49 - roberts a aka black bart you look like a
34:53 - pirate on the youtube preview
34:55 - yeah what do y'all think about that
34:56 - picture on the youtube preview i just i
34:59 - noticed that all my pictures started
35:00 - looking the same it's just like me
35:02 - smiling so i thought i'd do something
35:04 - goofy and different just to kind of
35:06 - break it up
35:08 - so
35:13 - uh
35:17 - yeah so i don't know if that's too silly
35:19 - let me know
35:30 - uh dt98 says what's this project all
35:33 - about
35:34 - um
35:35 - i'm making a new website for the
35:39 - university that i work for so it's a
35:40 - small university
35:42 - uh in uh ohio
35:45 - and
35:47 - their their main
35:49 - you know it's it's franciscan.edu is the
35:51 - website now
35:53 - so we're gonna replace that with this
35:55 - site um it's a react site
35:58 - and we get data from a wordpress
36:01 - content management system we pull it
36:04 - into react using graphql and apollo
36:08 - and we're using a material ui
36:11 - and following material design guidelines
36:14 - pretty closely
36:16 - you know there's we we have a little bit
36:17 - of room you know to do our own thing
36:19 - here but
36:20 - uh that's that's basically what we've
36:22 - we've been working on
36:35 - okay
36:45 - all right
36:46 - vippl says great videos but got too
36:49 - boring due to unnecessary chat and slow
36:52 - development
36:54 - all right thank you i appreciate the uh
36:59 - input there
37:00 - so uh anyway yeah let me know what you
37:03 - all think i i asked this question
37:05 - occasionally because this is not the
37:07 - first time uh that we've gotten some
37:09 - comments like that
37:10 - am i talking too much or is that
37:14 - a good thing in these videos and and
37:17 - i mean you know when we stop and do the
37:19 - question and answer stuff
37:21 - uh i do think the slow development is an
37:24 - issue
37:25 - uh i think the projects sometimes are
37:28 - unnecessary sl unnecessarily slow
37:31 - that's
37:32 - not always in my control
37:34 - you know sometimes
37:36 - like in this case the
37:39 - things happen and we had to kind of
37:40 - stretch out the the project so
37:44 - anyway not sure i
37:46 - can change the project timelines that
37:48 - much
37:51 - but i definitely could change
37:53 - about the talking so
37:55 - um if most of you think it's okay with
37:58 - the talking we'll keep going if you'd
37:59 - rather me cut back on that
38:01 - then
38:02 - i'll i'll think about doing that as well
38:15 - see
38:20 - uh okay uh michael and nikki are talking
38:22 - about attaching color values um
38:26 - here
38:26 - so you know what i did have a plug-in
38:28 - that did that in atom i don't know if i
38:30 - have that in visual studio code um
38:34 - oh you know what nikki says it does that
38:36 - in css but not here
38:40 - all right so maybe i'd have to get some
38:41 - sort of separate plug-in that would
38:43 - would do that also in
38:46 - javascript files
38:55 - okay john says it's called color
38:56 - highlight i'm not going to install it
38:58 - right now because i definitely don't
39:00 - need something else running even another
39:03 - plug-in while we're trying to do this so
39:05 - i'm afraid it'll just freeze everything
39:07 - up
39:11 - uh chris barker asks why are we why are
39:13 - you using javascript to control css
39:16 - uh
39:17 - yeah so in react we use javascript to
39:20 - control everything so
39:22 - css html
39:24 - it's all javascript
39:26 - um so that's that's kind of the react
39:28 - way to do it you can use regular css and
39:31 - we are using that as well
39:33 - uh but wherever we can we're using
39:36 - javascript because that's
39:39 - the usual way to do things with with
39:41 - react
39:50 - all right
39:51 - wow i actually almost got
39:54 - all the way through all these so but the
39:56 - timer just just went off
40:11 - all right let me
40:14 - i'm going to try to remember where i
40:15 - left off so i didn't get to everything
40:17 - um
40:18 - so if you asked something i didn't get
40:20 - to it yet
40:21 - please hang in there and then after this
40:23 - next session i will answer those
40:26 - questions
40:28 - all right
40:30 - so now that we have
40:32 - uh this color here and then we still
40:34 - have the title
40:37 - we need to do
40:40 - we need to do two things one is really
40:42 - important and necessary the other one i
40:44 - definitely want to have as well but it's
40:46 - not a hundred percent necessary so
40:48 - the on the thing that's not 100
40:50 - necessary is making that divider between
40:53 - each one we're going to do that
40:55 - uh if we have time but what we really
40:58 - need to do is we need some way for a
40:59 - user to click
41:01 - and get to the page right
41:04 - i've been thinking about this
41:06 - and a thought came to me
41:10 - i don't know a day or two ago
41:13 - and i added it in
41:16 - to an issue on github so
41:20 - let's open up github
41:24 - well we'll at least click to open it up
41:26 - and we'll come back to in a second
41:28 - uh so what we'll do is we'll make this
41:30 - title clickable
41:32 - we'll make it you know a link
41:35 - and then
41:37 - oops
41:40 - all right
41:42 - okay it finally opened okay cool
41:45 - um so i can find this issue
41:49 - it will jog my memory so i made sure i
41:51 - wrote it down in an issue so that i
41:53 - would not forget
41:56 - yeah
41:57 - here's how we're going to try to pull
41:58 - this off and
42:00 - we'll see if it works
42:09 - it's under the implement search
42:13 - okay
42:15 - so here and you all can read this too on
42:17 - your own it's you know the repos public
42:19 - uh link in the description
42:21 - so
42:25 - we're getting the data for this
42:28 - um
42:29 - you know from the wordpress api so what
42:31 - we'll have and we have already is the
42:33 - content type we're bringing that in
42:35 - we're already displaying that
42:37 - and then
42:40 - we're also bringing in the slug
42:42 - so if we have the content type and we
42:44 - have the slug for a lot of the content
42:47 - that's all we need to be able to
42:50 - recreate the correct route the correct
42:52 - url for this
42:54 - so
42:56 - let's try that see if it works
42:59 - and then we're probably going to find
43:01 - some cases where it doesn't work and
43:03 - then we can kind of modify things to try
43:06 - to fit those other cases
43:10 - so and if this is not making sense to
43:12 - you right now
43:13 - it
43:14 - hopefully it'll make sense once we start
43:15 - to actually use it
43:17 - uh and if it still doesn't make sense
43:19 - after we use it
43:20 - uh then i can explain it more just let
43:23 - me know in the chat
43:25 - i mean hopefully it works
43:28 - all right where are we at search
43:32 - okay
43:35 - so down here
43:41 - oh yes
43:45 - oops here we are
43:47 - okay i should probably pull this out
43:50 - of here so i can more easily get to it
43:52 - but it's all right now
43:55 - this this will probably end up being its
43:56 - own component at some point
44:00 - so
44:01 - here this span
44:04 - we're going to change
44:05 - [Music]
44:07 - into
44:09 - an a tag
44:10 - this is we're probably going to end up
44:12 - changing it into a link tag at some
44:15 - point
44:17 - but for testing i'm fine with just an a
44:19 - tag
44:21 - uh so we need
44:24 - an href
44:27 - and then our href we're going to put
44:29 - these back ticks so that we can do a
44:31 - template literal here
44:34 - because what we want is to do
44:38 - do we want
44:40 - we just want to do a slash for now
44:42 - and so we're going to have a slash and
44:44 - then we're going to use
44:46 - our template literal syntax to drop into
44:49 - javascript
44:52 - and
44:55 - actually oops
44:57 - my fault we need to go into javascript
45:00 - first
45:01 - to be able to use template literal
45:03 - syntax
45:04 - my fault
45:06 - okay
45:07 - if you're not familiar with template
45:09 - literal syntax put a question in the
45:11 - live chat and i'll explain it
45:16 - it's really cool and really useful so if
45:17 - you don't know about it i'm i'm more
45:19 - than happy to explain it because i i
45:21 - think it'll definitely you know benefit
45:23 - your coding uh if you know how to use it
45:26 - so
45:27 - we're going to try to recreate a route
45:29 - here so the first thing we need is item
45:32 - [Music]
45:33 - dot
45:35 - uh what did we call that uh type
45:39 - so item.type
45:41 - and then we're gonna put another slash
45:43 - and it's gonna be
45:48 - what is it going to be
46:00 - yeah
46:01 - anyway it just occurred to me how many
46:03 - like exceptions to this rule we're gonna
46:05 - have
46:06 - um
46:07 - so we have item.type and we're gonna
46:09 - have item
46:11 - dots
46:20 - and let's say that
46:25 - and see if it works
46:28 - and
46:30 - it hasn't refreshed yet so we'll have to
46:32 - give it a second
46:34 - okay
46:38 - all right cool so i have a few of you
46:40 - would like to know more about template
46:42 - little syntax so
46:43 - the
46:44 - refresh we're still waiting on the
46:46 - refresh so that'll give me a second to
46:47 - explain it so
46:49 - uh basically here's what you do so
46:51 - anywhere that you would normally use
46:52 - single quotes or double quotes in
46:54 - javascript you can instead use that
46:57 - backtick key and it's the little key
46:59 - right below your escape key right in the
47:01 - upper left hand corner your keyboard so
47:04 - uh it has the little uh like tioda
47:08 - uh character or uh it can be the back
47:11 - tick character so
47:13 - uh you use that and then within it
47:16 - you can type a string just like normal
47:19 - but you can also put a dollar sign and
47:22 - then curly brackets and within the curly
47:25 - brackets you can write javascript
47:28 - so this is useful in situations where
47:32 - let's say like normally
47:34 - we could have done it like this so we
47:36 - could have written
47:38 - href equals
47:40 - um and then you know put our normal
47:43 - quotation marks and then we would have
47:45 - had to put a slash and then we would
47:47 - have had to put a plus sign
47:49 - and then our item dot type
47:52 - and then the plus sign and then our
47:55 - [Music]
47:56 - slash and then a plus sign and then our
48:00 - item
48:02 - dot slug
48:03 - right
48:05 - well instead of having to put all those
48:07 - plus signs in different quotes we can
48:09 - just do it like this
48:11 - and it may not seem like we've saved a
48:13 - lot of space there
48:15 - but if you start adding a lot more in it
48:17 - definitely does save space and the other
48:19 - cool thing that we can do here
48:21 - is
48:22 - i could potentially put in a lot of like
48:26 - html in the string
48:29 - with spaces like i can hit enter here
48:32 - and this would still work
48:34 - normally you can't do that uh with
48:37 - strings so you can essentially create
48:39 - html templates with javascript variables
48:43 - in it
48:43 - and and use
48:45 - you know indentation and um
48:49 - line breaks right so you could hit enter
48:51 - and have them on multiple lines to make
48:53 - it look like real html
48:56 - so it's very helpful
48:58 - especially like if you're not using
48:59 - react and you you know you just want to
49:03 - make a quick you know template with some
49:05 - variables in it
49:07 - very useful
49:08 - so
49:09 - the that's template literal syntax
49:12 - um so you look that up if you want a
49:14 - better explanation you know i'm sure
49:16 - there are probably a lot of
49:18 - better like blogs and videos that
49:20 - explain it better than i can
49:22 - but that's just kind of a brief overview
49:24 - of how you would use that and why am i
49:26 - getting an error
49:28 - trailing spaces are not allowed okay
49:31 - at a trailing space
49:33 - all right
49:34 - um
49:36 - let's go and hopefully this is refreshed
49:38 - yeah it refreshed and it looks so ugly
49:41 - that's fine for now i'm okay with with
49:43 - it looking ugly but here's what we have
49:45 - see so now
49:47 - now it takes us to say major
49:49 - anthropology
49:50 - and this says department
49:53 - uh biology header
49:56 - let's try to find it one where this will
49:58 - actually work
50:00 - so biology department text there we go
50:03 - so department biology
50:05 - probably will work let's try it so let's
50:07 - click it
50:10 - and hopefully i have the data
50:14 - in there
50:15 - with the right slug
50:19 - no errors yet
50:22 - ah no
50:23 - okay so there was the air
50:26 - let's go back and try to find one where
50:28 - it works
50:38 - oh so slow
50:43 - all right
50:45 - look there again
50:48 - let's see
50:55 - see some of the times it's not gonna
50:57 - work so like right here we have
50:59 - department slash departments is the url
51:02 - okay so it's not gonna work for that
51:04 - uh
51:05 - oh we do have
51:07 - faculty
51:10 - this one should work
51:12 - all right yeah let's click on this one
51:15 - so for faculty member dr eric haney
51:20 - i know we have the data for him
51:23 - because we used him uh as an example for
51:25 - a while
51:29 - so
51:30 - slow so slow so if anyone is watching
51:33 - right now
51:34 - that is wealthy
51:36 - and really impatient
51:39 - and you'd like this to be sped up
51:42 - you can donate to the get a better
51:44 - computer so jesse can live stream faster
51:47 - from home fund
51:48 - so
51:50 - let me know i can give you my paypal and
51:52 - my wallet addresses for a variety of
51:54 - cryptocurrencies
52:00 - alright cool so that did work
52:03 - so this should work for all faculty
52:05 - members
52:07 - student profiles
52:09 - departments
52:11 - and
52:12 - [Music]
52:13 - for majors it's going to work but it's
52:16 - going to work
52:17 - a little
52:18 - differently so essentially there'll be
52:20 - two different urls that we can use to
52:22 - get to majors
52:24 - so what we'll need to do to get this to
52:25 - work for more things and i think the
52:27 - simplest way to get it to work is just
52:29 - to add to our um our server and our
52:33 - routing function that that translation
52:35 - object we're gonna have to add some more
52:38 - items to that object
52:40 - to have alternate urls for certain
52:43 - things that fit with this
52:47 - it's going to be a little bit weird to
52:49 - do that
52:51 - but
52:54 - the alternative is
52:57 - i don't i think it would be very
52:58 - complicated to try to
53:01 - switch things around and have like
53:03 - special rules for each content type
53:06 - so
53:07 - for now that's what what i'm going to do
53:10 - uh matt duchess says sorry got a jet
53:12 - catch y'all later thanks jesse uh you're
53:14 - welcome thanks for watching i'll see you
53:18 - um okay
53:20 - so cool so the concept works
53:23 - excellent
53:24 - there are some cases that aren't working
53:27 - properly
53:29 - we'll need to take care of that probably
53:30 - won't have time this stream yeah about
53:32 - 12 minutes left so i'm not going to get
53:34 - into the the more like edge cases right
53:37 - now
53:40 - that's something i think maybe i'd like
53:41 - to think about more
53:43 - um
53:44 - let you all think about it as well if
53:46 - you have any ideas
53:50 - michael creel says department slash
53:52 - departments work
53:53 - works yes
53:56 - sweet
53:57 - alright awesome so departments slash
54:00 - departments works
54:02 - so maybe there won't be as many cases as
54:04 - i i don't know exactly why that works
54:06 - but
54:07 - i'm not complaining
54:12 - blake says i love that idea but i don't
54:14 - have a lot of money yeah i don't
54:16 - i'm i'm like half joking with that as
54:18 - well so like please don't don't feel bad
54:20 - for me that my computer is too slow to
54:23 - stream like
54:24 - seriously only if there's somebody out
54:26 - there that like hit it big with crypto
54:28 - or something and like literally has
54:30 - thousands of dollars just to throw away
54:33 - like
54:34 - then i would i would
54:36 - i would accept that okay but i don't
54:38 - want any of you like
54:40 - uh
54:42 - you know who who aren't like very
54:44 - wealthy attempting to give me money for
54:46 - something because uh uh
54:49 - you know like
54:51 - i make enough money to support me and my
54:53 - family with you know a little bit left
54:55 - over so i'm not poor
54:57 - i don't you know i don't need
54:59 - uh
55:00 - i i don't want any of you who
55:02 - potentially make less money than me
55:04 - you know donating to
55:06 - to my cause uh i would just i'd feel
55:08 - terrible about that so anyway
55:11 - um
55:13 - let's uh let's see it pulls wp test tv
55:17 - with the department center and academics
55:24 - okay so michael said it it is pulling
55:27 - some data
55:29 - um
55:31 - okay cool well let's yeah let's bring
55:34 - this up again then and the last thing
55:36 - we'll do
55:37 - i do i see there's some more questions
55:39 - in the chat i will get to those in about
55:40 - 10 minutes
55:41 - uh
55:42 - what we really ought to do now is style
55:45 - this so that we don't have these
55:48 - really uh kind of ugly old school
55:50 - looking
55:52 - uh links
55:54 - so let's style that a bit
55:56 - and
55:57 - that'll probably be all we get to today
55:59 - which i think is
56:00 - significant you know we actually have
56:03 - functional links on our search page
56:06 - so let's
56:08 - let's go back here
56:09 - and i can get rid of this
56:15 - and let's see
56:17 - classes title
56:18 - so let's go up to our
56:21 - our class
56:22 - for title here
56:24 - where we have our
56:26 - css and so we still have the right font
56:29 - size the right font weight
56:31 - so
56:32 - we should only have to change
56:34 - the color and then we'll set this the
56:38 - text decoration
56:42 - to none okay that'll get rid of our
56:45 - underline
56:47 - and then
56:49 - our color
56:52 - should be
56:54 - you know what there's probably a match
56:57 - let's let's check our color page for
57:00 - whoops from material ui to see if
57:01 - there's something that we should use
57:04 - um
57:08 - where's our default
57:10 - or text um
57:14 - no i don't want gray
57:28 - hmm
57:31 - interesting
57:33 - okay so uh there probably is something
57:35 - within material ui that i could use but
57:37 - just since we're kind of running out of
57:39 - time i'm just going to use
57:41 - for color
57:43 - let's do
57:44 - rgb a
57:46 - and let's give it 0
57:50 - 0
57:51 - 0
57:53 - right that'll give us black
57:55 - wait there's no commas is there
57:58 - i always want to put commas in there and
57:59 - then it doesn't work
58:01 - zero zero zero and then the last one is
58:04 - our um
58:06 - like our transparency value
58:08 - uh so we're going to set this to 0.87
58:13 - and that's kind of the standard the
58:15 - reason we want to do this instead of
58:17 - just doing a gray hex value
58:19 - is
58:20 - because now that i see that i think i
58:23 - should put commas i'm so i'm
58:27 - i don't know what i'm doing like
58:29 - you do a thing so many times and it's
58:31 - like
58:32 - uh there are commas okay thank you nikki
58:39 - and michael says opacity that's the word
58:41 - i was looking for so opacity
58:44 - so anyway
58:46 - if you use a gray hex color it's much
58:49 - harder to read
58:50 - than if you use black
58:52 - with an opacity setting
58:55 - uh it will look grey
58:58 - but it'll be much more readable
59:00 - so
59:01 - always try to do that if you can if you
59:03 - have if you want gray text
59:06 - and if you don't believe me try it out
59:08 - try out a gray hex right next to
59:11 - an equivalent
59:12 - rgba black with opacity
59:16 - set at whatever to get that same color
59:19 - and it's amazing the first time i tried
59:21 - it and saw the difference i was
59:23 - wow i don't know why i don't know why it
59:25 - does that but you can check that out
59:27 - that's that's i didn't invent that
59:28 - that's straight out of the material
59:30 - design documentation
59:32 - all right anyway
59:35 - uh so
59:37 - i guess we'll have to wait for the uh
59:40 - reload
59:43 - um
59:44 - yeah but that should be fine
59:49 - why is our
59:50 - is our font weight
59:57 - while we're waiting let's inspect this
59:59 - and make sure font weight isn't
60:02 - there you go no it looks like it's it's
60:04 - it's in there
60:05 - all right cool there we are
60:07 - so now
60:09 - you can see we have our color
60:13 - okay so it's it it looks pretty dark
60:15 - like almost black but it's not black
60:18 - uh
60:19 - and
60:21 - great
60:23 - very cool
60:25 - um
60:26 - no i mean it may not be like 100
60:29 - immediately
60:31 - noticeable like oh hey that's a link
60:34 - we'll just have to see i'd like to maybe
60:36 - do some testing with users and just
60:39 - tell them to do a search and not say
60:41 - anything
60:42 - and just see where they go to click if
60:44 - they immediately go and try to click the
60:46 - title they think it'll be okay
60:48 - if they like try to click on something
60:50 - else first
60:52 - i don't know we'll see
60:53 - uh maybe we'll have to change the color
60:58 - um
60:59 - let's see
61:01 - let me check
61:02 - alright about four minutes
61:08 - all that time to wait for an error that
61:11 - i knew was coming
61:16 - okay well
61:18 - i don't
61:20 - i don't think i have time to implement
61:22 - the um
61:27 - that
61:28 - border like uh between
61:31 - you that little line separating each
61:34 - each item
61:35 - uh so five minute yeah and then actually
61:37 - it's less than four now so i'm just
61:40 - gonna go ahead and and start answering
61:41 - questions now so cut that pomodoro
61:44 - session just a bit short
61:46 - oh you know what and i always forget to
61:48 - do this
61:49 - let's
61:50 - let me take the last minute or so of the
61:52 - session to um
61:55 - uh commit this and then push it to
61:57 - github and that way you know you all
61:59 - will have a chance to review anything
62:01 - that we've done
62:02 - and it's a lot easier if you wanted to
62:04 - try to like use some of this on your own
62:07 - it's a lot easier to copy and paste from
62:08 - github
62:09 - instead of trying to type out what's on
62:11 - the video
62:12 - so in my terminal which it's a little
62:14 - bit small there so
62:15 - sorry if you can't
62:17 - read that right now but i'm going to say
62:20 - what i'm writing anyway so we're going
62:21 - to do a git status just to see what
62:24 - we've done and we've changed that fus
62:27 - theme dot js and we've changed search.js
62:30 - so
62:31 - i always like to verify that first and
62:34 - then that way if i've accidentally
62:36 - changed some other file and i didn't
62:38 - realize it
62:39 - uh then i can i can tell i mean it it
62:42 - rarely happens but occasionally you know
62:44 - you
62:45 - it it does happen sometimes so before we
62:48 - commit that and mess something up always
62:50 - check
62:51 - so now we'll do a git add
62:54 - and that adds those changes to the
62:56 - staging area so these are staged now
62:59 - ready to commit
63:00 - and i'm going to say do yarn cm and
63:03 - that's a special
63:05 - tool that we have here that helps us to
63:07 - write a good commit message
63:09 - if you don't have that tool you can just
63:11 - type git commit
63:13 - and then you can put
63:15 - hyphen m
63:16 - and then in
63:17 - quotation marks you can write your
63:19 - commit message right there in line it'll
63:21 - do the same thing as what we're doing
63:22 - now except you'll write your commit
63:24 - message all yourself instead of having
63:27 - this little walkthrough so we've added
63:29 - new features
63:31 - and
63:34 - what we've done is styled
63:40 - styled search
63:42 - results and
63:44 - we haven't broken anything
63:46 - does it change any open issues uh i
63:50 - suppose if we want to say that implement
63:52 - search issue which is 74 we can
63:55 - reference that issue
63:56 - um so let's say yes
64:00 - and let's put number 74
64:04 - um
64:07 - actually
64:09 - number
64:11 - 74
64:14 - and hit enter
64:17 - all right and now it'll run through and
64:19 - we have our project set up
64:21 - to do some testing and auto formatting
64:24 - the code so if you
64:26 - download this if you clone this repo and
64:29 - start working on it
64:30 - it will auto format your code it will
64:33 - link your code it will run tests
64:36 - so just be aware of that it could take a
64:38 - while depending on the speed of your
64:39 - computer
64:41 - so if you want to take this project and
64:43 - do something else with it on your own
64:45 - maybe you might want to disable that
64:47 - maybe you don't like the style we use
64:49 - that's totally fine but if you are going
64:51 - to try to
64:53 - submit code to this project which is
64:55 - totally cool if you want to do that that
64:56 - would be awesome
64:58 - just be aware that that does need to run
65:01 - uh because we want to keep everything
65:03 - really uniform as much as possible so
65:05 - you can code in whatever style you like
65:08 - but then when you go to commit it'll
65:09 - reformat to the style that we're using
65:11 - on this project which is the standard
65:14 - js style
65:17 - the biggest thing you'll notice about
65:19 - that is that we don't use semicolons
65:26 - all right so i'm just going to let that
65:27 - go while i go back to the live chat my
65:29 - pomodoro session just ended
65:32 - and let me scroll up to where i left off
65:35 - and answer some questions
65:40 - okay
65:42 - so
65:47 - all right so angie uh says never
65:51 - uh never been before thanks for the
65:52 - welcome i'm really new to coding and i'm
65:54 - trying to gain confidence oh awesome
65:56 - uh well i i hope that this is a place
65:59 - that can help you get some confidence
66:01 - and um
66:03 - yeah don't worry any questions are
66:05 - totally fine
66:06 - uh
66:08 - i i love getting questions and i'm very
66:10 - happy to explain what's going on i want
66:12 - this to be as beginner friendly as
66:14 - possible
66:17 - um
66:18 - yeah and let me know if there's anything
66:20 - i can do to make the stream better for
66:22 - you
66:23 - and uh if it if it's possible i'll
66:26 - definitely try it out
66:28 - uh chris barker says do you have to use
66:31 - javascript to control css and react
66:34 - no you don't
66:35 - you can use regular css and just you
66:39 - know import it as normal
66:43 - you could use sas if you wanted to
66:45 - so yeah you don't have to to use it like
66:48 - that
66:50 - react is very flexible when it comes to
66:52 - how you want to do css it actually has
66:56 - it has so many options for how to do css
66:59 - like i i can't even keep track of them
67:01 - all
67:03 - and all through our projects uh
67:05 - that we've done on the live stream
67:07 - i think we've used a different
67:10 - some different way to do css on everyone
67:13 - it seems like we're always trying out
67:14 - something something new
67:32 - let's see it says michael says jesse
67:35 - regarding the preview
67:38 - uh
67:39 - there are
67:43 - there are new women in here today just
67:45 - saying
67:48 - all right i don't
67:50 - michael let me know what you were saying
67:52 - there i'm not
67:59 - i'm not exactly sure what you say are
68:01 - you saying that i should do like my
68:03 - normal thing where i tell everybody what
68:05 - the streams about that i usually forget
68:07 - to do
68:09 - for the new people anyway let me let me
68:11 - know i guess it's kind of late in the
68:13 - stream to do that i'll have to remember
68:14 - to do it next time though
68:16 - i need to just write a little script so
68:18 - i can just
68:19 - go through it
68:20 - i've been streaming for almost a year
68:22 - now you think i would have sorted that
68:23 - out
68:26 - uh
68:28 - jason lee says from columbus ohio oh
68:30 - awesome
68:32 - awesome jason yeah so i'm i'm in
68:34 - steubenville ohio
68:35 - uh so like right um right there on the
68:39 - border between ohio and west virginia
68:41 - and
68:42 - pennsylvania is right there as well
68:46 - [Music]
68:51 - who is that

69:02 - she's really upset because the door is
69:04 - closed so she can't get in
69:14 - uh nikki says try giving that gold text
69:16 - uh the css letter spacing 1.4 okay cool
69:20 - i'll keep in mind to mess with the
69:22 - letter spacing there
69:24 - hey you got the door open no no no come
69:27 - here you want to you want to see data
69:28 - come here do you want me to hold you
69:31 - no you just want to get all my cups
69:36 - she's down here
69:40 - here
69:41 - do you want to be on youtube here it's
69:43 - okay i'm almost done
69:45 - all right
69:46 - hey everybody this is cordelia could do
69:48 - you say hi
69:50 - you say hi
69:52 - wave right there wave right there
69:55 - hello
69:56 - hi
70:00 - all right can you can you say hello
70:05 - all right
70:09 - what
70:10 - what do you want
70:12 - you you want milk i don't have any milk
70:14 - do you want to go upstairs and get your
70:16 - milk from mama
70:17 - okay
70:18 - go ahead
70:20 - go ahead
70:21 - go get it
70:22 - good girl
70:25 - all right so that was cordelia that's my
70:27 - my baby
70:30 - uh
70:31 - all right sorry about that
70:33 - let me find my place
70:35 - okay uh matt duchess says
70:38 - you do you no such thing is too silly
70:40 - all right so that was when i was asking
70:42 - if my my picture was too silly today so
70:45 - thank you
70:48 - um
70:50 - let's see
70:51 - uh nikki says it makes all caps a bit
70:53 - easier to read if they're spaced out a
70:54 - bit more
70:56 - oh okay cool that makes sense that
70:58 - totally makes sense
71:03 - anna says i like when you talk too much
71:06 - all right thanks and i appreciate the
71:08 - the input
71:09 - um
71:10 - i usually when
71:13 - in the past every time that somebody has
71:15 - suggested that i talk less and code more
71:18 - um i've gotten a bunch of people saying
71:21 - no i actually like the talking that's
71:23 - what's unique about
71:25 - this stream that i do take the time to
71:26 - answer all the questions and explain
71:28 - things so
71:30 - if i keep getting that reaction then
71:32 - i'll i'll keep talking um
71:35 - i think the pomodoro
71:39 - method that we're using here
71:41 - does help to keep a balance
71:44 - so i guess i'll keep going with that and
71:46 - for those of you that would prefer less
71:47 - talking
71:48 - and more coding um you can always uh
71:51 - wait and watch the recordings you can
71:53 - watch it on like two time speed
71:56 - i've heard that i'm you can still
71:58 - understand me at two time speed probably
71:59 - because i don't talk very fast normally
72:02 - uh and then you can skip the breaks
72:05 - whenever i'm talking
72:06 - so you know maybe
72:10 - that might make things a little bit
72:12 - less boring for you
72:14 - uh but
72:16 - if it is too boring i totally understand
72:18 - there's so many other really useful
72:19 - videos out there like go
72:22 - you can watch those and it it'll be fine
72:25 - you gotta find the tools that work for
72:26 - you um so i totally understand that
72:31 - um
72:32 - matt duchess says talking is preferred
72:34 - it helps to see your thought process
72:38 - cool angie says you
72:39 - you haven't confused me yet i think
72:41 - you're fine
72:42 - uh blake says i like the talking uh
72:45 - development isn't slow necessarily but
72:47 - it is a little during the live streams
72:49 - uh by the way the stream quality is good
72:51 - awesome
72:52 - okay yeah
72:53 - um
72:54 - all right well i will keep talking then
72:58 - um okay angie asks uh what to react
73:04 - okay cool so john says you can go to
73:06 - react.js.org
73:08 - which is great
73:09 - um
73:11 - let me give you um
73:14 - just a brief explanation of what react
73:16 - is uh so certainly you'll get a better
73:18 - explanation at react.js.org but just for
73:20 - you and anybody else that's watching
73:22 - it's not familiar with react
73:24 - react is a javascript library
73:27 - that allows you to make
73:30 - uh web applications
73:32 - and it takes care of a lot of the behind
73:34 - the scenes thing that sometimes things
73:36 - that can be really tricky
73:38 - uh so
73:40 - updating the state of your application
73:43 - uh manipulating the dom so the document
73:46 - object model basically the elements the
73:48 - html elements that are on the page
73:51 - so
73:52 - those are just some of the things that
73:54 - it does
73:56 - it can do a lot more
73:59 - kind of behind the scenes what it's
74:00 - doing is
74:02 - you're writing javascript functions and
74:04 - then those functions are adding the html
74:07 - elements to the page
74:09 - but it looks still a lot like html
74:12 - because there's this layer on top of it
74:14 - called jsx
74:16 - that makes it way easier to use so you
74:19 - can write what seems like normal html
74:21 - but in reality
74:23 - you're writing javascript functions
74:26 - so reacts uh the some of the benefits of
74:30 - react are um you have these components
74:33 - that are really easy to reuse
74:35 - uh you can have large projects still be
74:38 - like manageable
74:39 - uh you can it it's fast
74:42 - like
74:43 - things happening on the page happen
74:45 - really fast so
74:46 - i don't want to get too in-depth i said
74:48 - it would be a short explanation but
74:49 - that's that's some of what react is
74:52 - you've probably seen a lot of websites
74:54 - that use react uh facebook users react
74:56 - um
74:59 - uh trying to think instagram at least
75:01 - the web version of instagram is react i
75:03 - don't know if the app is react native or
75:05 - not
75:05 - uh let's see what else is react
75:09 - netflix uses react
75:12 - uh
75:13 - godaddy's website is react
75:16 - i'm trying to think what uh i'm like
75:18 - blanking out here but there are a lot of
75:19 - websites that use uh react
75:23 - right now so
75:25 - if you haven't heard of it
75:27 - you know you've at least probably seen
75:29 - it without even realizing
75:38 - uh nino says is the github thing that
75:40 - helps you push better github commits
75:42 - available for npm yeah it is
75:44 - so it's uh committed let me bring up on
75:47 - the screen my
75:49 - package.json file
75:56 - i should just leave that file up all the
75:58 - time because i
75:59 - it seems like i always refer to it at
76:01 - some point
76:03 - so
76:08 - committed c-o-m-m-i-t-i-z-e-n
76:11 - [Music]
76:12 - um and then
76:14 - uh cz conventional change log
76:18 - so
76:21 - those i believe it's those two packages
76:24 - that are doing most of that and then
76:26 - it's tied in i i think with our
76:28 - pre-commit hook so
76:30 - the documentation for committees should
76:32 - cover a lot of which you need to set it
76:34 - up and you can check out our project to
76:36 - see you know how we've set it up as well
76:39 - but um
76:40 - yeah if you want to see version numbers
76:42 - and stuff and copy and paste it check
76:44 - out the package.json file in in this
76:46 - github repo
76:58 - oh nikki i just saw that you already
77:01 - answered nina's question so sorry about
77:03 - that
77:03 - thank you nikki for answering that
77:15 - oh okay so nikki i didn't realize so for
77:18 - those of you that use the
77:20 - azerty keyboard instead of the qwerty
77:23 - keyboard keyboard
77:25 - um the backtick is
77:28 - next to the enter key and
77:32 - it's via alt
77:35 - gr
77:36 - so
77:38 - for qwerty users the way i explained it
77:40 - earlier is where you get it but
77:42 - no i guess not so for everyone else so
77:44 - thanks nikki i was not aware of that
78:01 - all right almost to the bottom of the
78:03 - chat so if you have a question you
78:04 - haven't put it in there yet um
78:07 - get it in there quickly because once i
78:09 - get to the bottom i'll um i'll end the
78:10 - stream and if you're watching this later
78:13 - on and want to ask a question please put
78:14 - it in the comments or you can ask me the
78:17 - question um through any
78:20 - uh social media channel that you can
78:22 - find me at uh if you check out the link
78:24 - to my youtube channel from there i have
78:26 - linked all my different social media
78:28 - profiles so
78:30 - reach out to me however you would like
78:32 - uh it doesn't matter to me whatever is
78:34 - best for you and i'll do my best to get
78:36 - back to you as soon as i can
78:42 - uh carlos says hi jesse what back end
78:45 - are you using what's the setup for your
78:46 - front end uh sorry if you've said this
78:48 - before
78:50 - okay so i had some
78:53 - um
78:57 - some answers to this in the live chat
78:59 - but let me just give a really brief
79:01 - overview for everyone so
79:04 - front end is react the back end
79:07 - is for at least for the react stuff is
79:09 - we were using nodes we're using node and
79:12 - express
79:14 - um
79:15 - to handle a lot of stuff a lot of
79:17 - routing and things like that
79:18 - and then separate from there located on
79:21 - an entirely different server is a
79:25 - wordpress installation that we're just
79:27 - using to handle the data we're not using
79:30 - any of like wordpress themes or anything
79:32 - like that
79:34 - and so that's the setup so the data
79:36 - database is tied in with wordpress so
79:39 - essentially we just use wordpress to
79:40 - manage the database so mysql database we
79:43 - pull data out of that mysql database
79:45 - using graphql
79:47 - we pull that into our
79:50 - react app the only exception being on
79:52 - our search page we don't use graphql we
79:54 - just use the standard rest api for
79:56 - wordpress
80:11 - um nikki asked when i was talking about
80:13 - the difference between gray text and
80:15 - black text with um
80:18 - opacity at
80:19 - i mean we use values like 0.87 for
80:22 - normal text 0.54 for um
80:26 - for input text
80:28 - but
80:29 - nikki says what's the reason it looks
80:31 - more readable better anti-aliasing or
80:33 - something i'm teddy truth i'm not really
80:35 - sure
80:37 - uh michael says just a guess but it's
80:38 - not as hard as the solid gray since it's
80:41 - slightly see-through
80:43 - it could be yeah
80:48 - michael says just realize you're using
80:50 - the second terminal
80:54 - michael says no the picture
80:58 - what picture
81:05 - oh i know now so when you're talking
81:07 - about explain the preview all right yeah
81:10 - so
81:12 - so the preview thumbnail for the video i
81:14 - took a goofy picture of my face because
81:18 - just to switch things up
81:20 - like because i normally just take the
81:23 - same type of picture of just me smiling
81:25 - so anyway i just thought i'd be goofy
81:26 - today to change things up but
81:30 - this is like somewhat of a serious
81:32 - stream though so
81:52 - angie says my brother lives in yellow
81:54 - springs ohio okay cool yeah it's always
81:56 - fun to learn where people are from
81:57 - because sometimes it's like
82:00 - find out people are actually like close
82:01 - to where i'm at or like really cool one
82:04 - day i think it would be super awesome to
82:06 - have some type of meetup for all the
82:08 - people that like watch the stream uh
82:12 - either like
82:14 - maybe if i'm traveling somewhere
82:16 - and
82:17 - it's in a location where a lot of you
82:19 - are or something like that
82:21 - i mean maybe it'll just be every time i
82:23 - travel somewhere i'll let you all know
82:24 - where i'm going and anybody that's close
82:26 - we can just like hang out or something
82:29 - uh if any of you would be up for that
82:31 - let me know
82:33 - i just think it'd be fun like to
82:34 - actually hang out in person um
82:37 - at some point
82:39 - since i mean like we we spent a lot of
82:41 - time together online doing these streams
82:44 - so
82:45 - uh
82:46 - it would be it would be kind of cool
82:50 - uh kishore says uh how to make a react
82:52 - app into a progressive web app which is
82:55 - popping up on
82:57 - dev blog
83:01 - hey baby
83:02 - you want to be on youtube
83:15 - um
83:18 - yeah
83:20 - so kishore's talking about that yeah so
83:22 - there is a recent article uh i didn't
83:24 - read it yet
83:26 - but it does talk about how to turn a
83:27 - react app into progressive web app
83:30 - um yeah so check that out if you're
83:32 - interested in that it is actually really
83:34 - easy so
83:35 - uh we've done it before

83:38 - projects that we've done um
83:41 - that's actually been done usually
83:43 - harshit takes care of that
83:45 - um
83:46 - but yeah it's it's
83:47 - just a few extra lines and it's it's

87:20 - oh nikki says visual studio code tip
87:24 - control clicking on a component name
87:26 - brings you to that file
87:29 - interesting
87:31 - let's let's try it
87:37 - that sounds really cool so uh let's see
87:40 - if i have component name
87:43 - [Music]
87:47 - i may not have my own component name in
87:50 - here or a component in here at all
87:53 - i should try index that's that's
87:55 - probably
87:56 - where i have okay so let's control
87:59 - click
88:03 - definition
88:05 - i guess it didn't
88:08 - nope didn't work for me let me try
88:10 - command since i'm on a mac command click
88:12 - ctrl click
88:15 - hmm
88:18 - okay it didn't work for me yeah
88:21 - did you a box just popped up yeah they
88:23 - can teleport they can see it this is
88:25 - what they see on the screen
88:29 - all right
88:32 - michael says regarding graphql
88:36 - oops
88:38 - my window
88:40 - my chat window just jumped down to the
88:42 - bottom so i lost track where i was there
88:44 - we go so michael says regarding graphql
88:46 - i've sort of gotten a hand on it but
88:48 - can't figure out how to connect the the
88:51 - test wordpress database you set up
88:54 - i can hard code the search result url
88:56 - but not search your main url
89:00 - huh
89:02 - um so do i need to have admin rights to
89:04 - do the search on wordpress or is there a
89:06 - graphql plugin that i might need maybe
89:10 - dada you um you know what
89:13 - you could
89:14 - um let the computer
89:17 - um let him in to your thing
89:21 - well we could let me
89:23 - hmm
89:26 - let me i'm trying to think over this
89:28 - look at the problem could be
89:30 - so
89:32 - maybe they're not allowed to do that so
89:34 - they
89:35 - because they might mess a mess
89:37 - everything up
89:39 - um i think that like
89:42 - why but he's not gonna ask anything
89:45 - i'm not saying now
89:47 - okay so you're saying so the search
89:49 - results work for you but the graphql
89:53 - stuff doesn't is that
89:57 - let me know because like the the search
89:59 - uses the rest api so that should work
90:02 - right off the bat with any wordpress
90:04 - instance it should be fine um
90:07 - the graph the graphql should work too
90:10 - i'm i'm not sure why it wouldn't be
90:12 - working i don't have any
90:15 - like restrictions or limitations set on
90:17 - it
90:19 - at least not right now
90:24 - what if everyone was
90:26 - who was doing it was just right next to
90:29 - your computer
90:31 - yeah that would be crazy if they
90:34 - all right let me let me answer these
90:36 - questions then we can talk okay what are
90:38 - other questions there's all right here
90:40 - there's more questions see
90:42 - um
90:43 - yeah so they're waiting for me to answer
90:45 - the questions so i don't want to make
90:47 - them wait for too long okay that's a ton
90:49 - of questions all right well let's get
90:50 - through them uh le levitt says
90:54 - vim awesome also uses react
90:56 - cool very cool
90:58 - um blake says i ended up getting a
91:00 - surface pro 2 again
91:02 - okay cool blake let me know how that
91:04 - goes for you um and how you like it
91:12 - uh psy sai i'm not sure how to pronounce
91:15 - that let me know if i pronouncing it
91:16 - wrong but anyway so i says uh learning a
91:19 - lot of things awesome
91:21 - uh i'm
91:23 - super glad whenever somebody learned
91:24 - something from these streams so
91:27 - i imagine that you all don't always
91:28 - learn it from me there's a lot of really
91:30 - smart people on the live chat giving um
91:33 - some some good information but as long
91:35 - as you learn something
91:37 - yeah they're smarter than
91:43 - gummy me
91:44 - i don't have any gummy bears down here
91:47 - can i
91:48 - get go back upstairs uh think about it
91:52 - let's talk to your mom
91:56 - [Music]
91:59 - uh let's see nikki says i was watching a
92:01 - tutorial and the instructor used it
92:02 - without mentioning it my mind was blown
92:04 - it was so cool okay that was the uh the
92:06 - tip
92:07 - in visual studio code that i couldn't
92:09 - get to work but i'm probably just doing
92:11 - something wrong so i'll have to try it
92:13 - again later
92:16 - your coffee
92:18 - yeah you know what there's coffee
92:19 - grounds in the bottom
92:21 - so you can i didn't even realize there's
92:23 - anything left i thought i drank it all
92:27 - if you don't if you don't want the
92:29 - coffee grounds it's fine i'll just i'll
92:31 - drink it i don't mind it when i was
92:34 - little mama used to
92:36 - mama once gave me a haul like
92:39 - different a whole like
92:41 - like a little jar of coffee and i drank
92:45 - it all wow okay listen listen remember
92:48 - coffee gemma remember we're gonna talk
92:50 - later okay all right thank you um
92:55 - i'm gonna say one more thing my shoes
92:57 - kept getting untied in school
93:00 - oh okay well you have to you have to
93:02 - double knot them you know how to double
93:04 - knot double knotting all right well
93:06 - we're not doubling mine um okay well we
93:10 - can we can test test out some notes
93:12 - later okay
93:14 - um
93:16 - uh dev moore says hi new here and to
93:18 - react i was wondering if it's a good
93:21 - idea to go through your earlier projects
93:24 - it could be
93:25 - the only thing about some of the earlier
93:27 - projects are so i've been streaming for
93:28 - almost a year now so some of the things
93:31 - that we did early on are outdated
93:33 - so
93:34 - you know a lot of the packages that
93:35 - we've used have have new changes and and
93:38 - some of the changes are breaking changes
93:40 - uh even react has has come you know when
93:43 - we started this that was pre-react 16.
93:48 - baby you gotta let me talk i wanna say
93:50 - one more thing
93:52 - can it wait
93:53 - no so after no
93:56 - so anyway you can look you can probably
93:58 - still get some good info from the
94:00 - previous projects
94:01 - but just be aware that some of that
94:03 - stuff may be outdated
94:06 - um
94:07 - so
94:10 - if if you're okay with that then yeah go
94:12 - ahead and watch some of the previous
94:13 - stuff i probably do a better job of
94:15 - explaining things earlier on and like as
94:18 - i've gone on i kind of just
94:20 - stopped explaining like the same thing
94:22 - over and over again i have two things to
94:24 - say
94:25 - why don't you
94:26 - write down what you want to say so you
94:28 - don't forget and then we can talk about
94:30 - it after
94:32 - um
94:33 - well the world says did you become a
94:35 - remote worker uh yeah so i'm semi remote
94:39 - right now
94:40 - uh so i'll probably be spending like
94:44 - a few days a week at home a few days in
94:47 - the office
94:50 - uh
94:52 - carlos says thanks for explaining very
94:54 - intricate back end routing and stuff
94:56 - from wordpress to node.js express and
94:58 - then react cool yeah it's
95:01 - it's a little bit more complicated than
95:03 - probably most uh university websites are
95:06 - but i think the results are gonna be
95:09 - they're gonna be worth it
95:16 - as long as you don't get on my computer
95:18 - i'm all right with that
95:19 - um
95:20 - yeah so i think the results gonna be a
95:22 - very fast and flexible
95:24 - website
95:29 - john says jesse have you seen the movie
95:31 - brainstorm a scary precursor to your new
95:34 - headset
95:35 - i haven't seen it maybe i have to check
95:36 - it out if it's on netflix i'll check it
95:38 - out
95:40 - yeah actually so i got the headset in
95:42 - the mail today
95:43 - so if if you want to know more i have a
95:45 - project where i'm going to work with a
95:47 - uh brain computer interface to try to
95:49 - help my son raphael with his uh his
95:52 - mental illness he has obsessive
95:53 - compulsive disorder
95:55 - um and get some anxiety
95:57 - you can use yeah you can use it too
95:59 - so
96:00 - i'm gonna be working on that project
96:03 - uh i'll i'll probably be putting some
96:05 - videos on my own youtube channel about
96:07 - it so if you're interested you can
96:09 - subscribe to my youtube channel the
96:10 - links in the description
96:12 - and um
96:14 - i'll be doing videos on that soon i'd
96:15 - like to work on it like later today and
96:18 - tomorrow if i can
96:19 - uh so anyway um
96:22 - i don't know hopefully i can help my son
96:24 - and then maybe help other people too if
96:26 - if it works
96:31 - but anyway if you want to know more
96:32 - about it watch yesterday's stream
96:34 - because i i explain more in depth what i
96:36 - want to do and there is a conversation
96:38 - on twitter more about it too so uh if
96:41 - you want to check out my twitter it's
96:42 - it's a somewhat recent tweet there's a
96:45 - kind of a big conversation going on
96:47 - there
96:48 - um blake says the meetup would be cool
96:51 - cool
96:52 - cool that's well i'll definitely let you
96:54 - all know whenever i'm going right now
96:56 - i'm the closest big city i am that i'm
96:59 - to is pittsburgh so if any of you
97:02 - gemmas is too loud you see the red for
97:04 - the microphone thing when it gets to red
97:07 - it's too loud
97:10 - why we don't want it to get to the red
97:11 - it's like the noise meter at school
97:14 - except there are a ton of balls okay
97:17 - remember you're gonna write down
97:20 - you're going to write i wanted to go on
97:22 - all the way down
97:23 - no no you're going to hurt everybody's
97:25 - ears
97:30 - i'm going to have to
97:31 - i might have to turn down the mic here
97:33 - let me turn it down a bit
97:35 - hopefully you can still hear me hey
97:38 - yeah damn angel
97:40 - i'm not gonna let you be down here for
97:41 - these if you don't quit talking
97:44 - okay
97:45 - and don't don't shake the chair
97:48 - baby i like having you on here but you
97:50 - gotta listen okay
97:52 - um
97:54 - where are we at
97:56 - oh anyway if anybody is in or around the
97:59 - pittsburgh area now or if you're ever
98:01 - traveling around there definitely let me
98:03 - know because it wouldn't be that hard
98:04 - for me to uh drive up and and you know
98:07 - meet up there
98:15 - all right blake's in upstate south
98:17 - carolina
98:18 - cool i may be in charleston later i'm
98:20 - thinking about going to a conference in
98:22 - charleston i haven't bought tickets yet
98:23 - though but i'll let you know if i go
98:26 - i mean i know charleston isn't
98:28 - isn't really uh that is rich upstate but
98:32 - it's closer than where i am now
98:34 - dad is rich
98:37 - you think i'm rich you're rich oh yeah
98:40 - you're a rich man with a beard on your
98:43 - head
98:44 - okay
98:47 - remember we're gonna write down our
98:49 - ideas what we want to talk about write
98:50 - them down oh yeah
98:56 - john says basically create react app out
98:57 - of the box builds a progressive web app
98:59 - automatically yeah you know what you are
99:01 - right john uh
99:04 - that's true like you have everything you
99:05 - need for a progressive web app yeah
99:07 - right mr john gemma
99:12 - michael cruz says uh have franciscan
99:15 - university host a conference and pay for
99:17 - us to get there it really wouldn't be
99:20 - that many people think how much we could
99:21 - do on a hackathon over the over a
99:23 - weekend oh actually that's a great idea
99:26 - yeah right
99:28 - michael gemma or my channel whatever
99:30 - your name is
99:32 - do you go upstairs no all right
99:35 - so
99:36 - i had an idea and i presented it to the
99:39 - head of my department at franciscan
99:42 - gemma
99:43 - why don't you go play in the other room
99:44 - and i'll come get you when i'm done
99:46 - nope
99:48 - i'm saying you're going to hurt
99:49 - everybody's ears when you scream like
99:50 - that because they probably have
99:51 - headphones on okay okay i don't want you
99:55 - hurting everybody's ears okay all right
99:58 - okay okay
100:01 - uh you're not gonna get any any gummy
100:02 - bears if you scream anymore okay
100:05 - no gummy bears
100:08 - all right you gotta be a good girl then
100:10 - i wouldn't make it all the way to that
100:12 - yellow no
100:13 - all right so
100:15 - here was my idea
100:17 - uh i had an idea to start a
100:20 - boot camp like a coding boot camp a code
100:23 - school at franciscan so it wouldn't be
100:25 - for actually you know
100:27 - university credit
100:30 - and that would actually be an advantage
100:31 - because
100:32 - being accredited uh and all that means
100:35 - like we'd have to have people with
100:36 - masters and phds teaching
100:38 - um and the the process to get courses
100:41 - approved is really really slow
100:43 - but if we did it as this separate entity
100:46 - kind of like catechetical institute did
100:48 - that site that we did for them they're
100:50 - an institute people don't get real
100:51 - degrees through there they get a
100:53 - certificate
100:54 - it would be somewhat like that
100:56 - but it would be tied into franciscan so
100:59 - since i wouldn't be like a real
101:01 - professor i could teach there
101:03 - or you know other people you know could
101:06 - teach that don't necessarily need to
101:07 - have a degree so anyway i thought it
101:10 - would be cool and then we could branch
101:12 - out like start with web dev stuff but
101:13 - branch out into maybe like some other
101:15 - cool things like machine learning and
101:17 - then that way like
101:20 - i don't know i think it could be useful
101:22 - uh i think people might might like that
101:24 - and
101:25 - it could be good for the university too
101:27 - so i just need to tell the right people
101:30 - i guess and get it started probably find
101:33 - donors who are willing to donate to get
101:35 - it started as well
101:36 - but um
101:38 - i think it'd be cool
101:40 - all right i'm gonna read it after
101:42 - after
101:44 - gemma
101:47 - and angie said hello and john said hello
101:51 - carlos too i thought i said mr johnny
102:03 - see
102:04 - your beard's getting in my face
102:07 - it's not even your bearded your hair
102:10 - what technically your beard in your hair
102:13 - i think there's a line right there
102:16 - i like that i might have just made a
102:18 - lightweight they said that you sound
102:20 - smart
102:24 - who said that was that
102:26 - who said that was that mr j johnson
102:29 - yeah that was mr johnny hi mr johnny
102:36 - all right anna says you're so cute
102:40 - crazy says uh what's up hey how's it
102:44 - going thanks for joining in the the live
102:46 - chat cornelia is coming
102:51 - you want us
102:53 - you want to be
102:54 - you want to
103:03 - what's that cchs crusaders oh okay
103:05 - that's the um
103:07 - central yeah the catholic the catholic
103:10 - high school here in stephenville is is
103:12 - catholic central high school and the
103:14 - mascot is the crusaders so cchs
103:17 - crusaders
103:19 - say hi
103:23 - michael says my youngest has autism
103:25 - along with adhd so your project sounds
103:27 - interesting oh yeah i mean i
103:30 - i don't have any medical background i
103:31 - don't have experience with this yet but
103:33 - i did
103:34 - i i don't know i
103:36 - the idea makes sense that it could
103:38 - happen it just it's just a matter of if
103:40 - i can get reliable consistent data
103:43 - from this headset
103:44 - if not like i might have to buy a more
103:46 - expensive headset
103:48 - to get good data but i think like
103:57 - um
104:03 - [Music]
104:05 - jose says cool stuff regards from el
104:07 - salvador
104:11 - hey how's it going
104:14 - uh let's see
104:17 - javascript says hey i was born and lived
104:19 - until age four in charleston oh cool
104:22 - you probably don't remember that much if
104:23 - you left at age four but i think
104:24 - charleston is one of my favorite cities
104:27 - really beautiful city especially in the
104:29 - spring
104:41 - [Music]
104:43 - yeah you see the headphones
104:46 - you wanna wear them
104:49 - all right
104:53 - blake says do i get a name i guess not
104:55 - she left
105:04 - and blake says family reunion
105:07 - uh blake also said hey jesse that sounds
105:09 - like a cool project what language are
105:11 - you using we're actually gonna use
105:12 - javascript
105:13 - so um
105:15 - alex castillo has done a lot of work
105:18 - with us already and uh he has some
105:20 - github repos where he's able to get the
105:21 - data and use javascript to display it uh
105:25 - like on a website like on a web app so
105:28 - that's that's we're going to use it's
105:29 - going to be cool
105:32 - [Music]
105:34 - and all right so i've gotten to the
105:36 - bottom of the live chat so i'm going to

106:58 - ya

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody uh welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and i am trying to stream from home again today so i got my internet upgraded and i made some changes to my settings on obs but i'm still getting occasionally some some issues so let me know uh on your end how this this looks what kind of quality are you getting um and and we'll see i um there's still a few more things that i could try so if it gets bad you know it may be able to fix it but today we are going to work on that search page that we were working on yesterday so yesterday we worked on styling the search bar and we styled the sorting drop down and the um the filters the checkbox filters so i don't know if style would be the right word we um we arranged them differently uh so we laid it out differently so today i'd like to focus on uh styling the actual results so right now they look a mess and i'll switch over to them now because i think i look a mess the only thing i do want to show you when i'm in this view is uh my cool shirt so i get this shirt uh from my grandma at christmas time powered by ramen so anyway i'm a ramen fan um let me switch over now okay cool now we'll be able to see the code i'm gonna make it a bit bigger and i was working on the routing i i did make some pretty uh interesting changes to the routing function so if you want to check out what i've done uh look at the last thing that was let's see if i did this give push all right so i just now pushed these changes so the last commit that is pushed up to the repo uh has some changes to be able to handle some different situations uh particularly when we have two parameters for our routing in our server.js file so i added a lot of comments to try to make it easier to understand so someone can ask me at the end of the stream if you want me to go through this i'm not going to right now but hopefully the comments will help you if you want to check it out on your own the link to the repo should be in the description all right so let's go over and go over to the search page i've been slowly going through every link i could find on every page and making sure that the data slugs are correct in wordpress and that the the router handles it correctly so it's just been uh it it's kind of slow going because occasionally i'll run into something and i'm like are you serious that url is why why is it like that and then i'll have to go back and that's why i had to add some logic into the router to handle this case that i had found all right so we're going to go on to the search page and every one thing i i have noticed and we noticed a little bit the last time i tried to stream from home is that everything is slower uh so even if the stream is okay everything else on this machine is slower so if it gets too bad i may end up either using a different machine completely i have a windows desktop that might be better or it's possible and um the guy i believe was it matthew yeah i think his name was matthew who would help i mentioned yesterday it helped me out he said that it's possible to run obs on a completely different machine network as my laptop and then all the streaming stuff would be handled by that machine and then i would just handle uh the you know actually building the stuff so that might be the best solution i just need to get that all set up on the other computer which currently is on the other side of my house right now so i have to figure some way to make that work okay all right blake uh hey everybody i see you in the in the chat here so blake asks for a speed test uh yeah maybe we'll do a speed test later on remind me towards the the end of the stream or on the next break about doing a speed test it's not spectacular the best internet i can get here is uh 25 on the upload and or 25 on the download and 5 on the upload uh so still not great but i even asked like do you have anything else and i said no that's the the highest we can go so so that's what we have literally the best money can buy all for the stream nikki says speed test while streaming is not a good idea okay yeah good call so anyway those are i'll tell you what the results of my speed test were after i upgraded um i think i was getting like a little over three on the upload and the download was some it was like 17. so you know how that works you never really get what they what they say all right so we do have the search uh page up now and i'm gonna start my pomodoro timer we're going to do a 25minute pomodoro session where we code after that we'll take a fiveminute break and i'll answer any questions that are in the live chat and we're just going to go back and forth we'll do two pomodoro sessions today um unless for some reason we just fly through this and make everything look perfect within the first 25 minutes uh then when we do one and then at the end i'll take all the rest of the time to answer questions and let's see i'm just checking what's in the chat right now all right great so it seems like the stream's doing well i've got no weird messages about it uh from obs so let me check yeah uh most of the users are getting 720p so mostly you're getting 720p which is great that's what i'm shooting for all right i think this is doable so let's search for something i keep searching for biology so why not just keep going and search for biology all right so why did anthropology come up immediately when i searched biology i don't know i guess the word biology must be in there somewhere so here's our search results i'll zoom in so right now we're getting the category which is major although i talked to my boss and evidently it's it's really the department and not necessarily the major uh so the title on the current website said major departments or department majors or something like that there was or no programs i'm sorry these are programs so they said major programs so i think we're gonna go with calling them programs instead for now i'm gonna stick with majors because there's no sense in me changing everything unless i'm 100 sure so anyway the categories is major we see here here's a category for department so we're displaying categories we're displaying the date which we may or may not even want to display i just needed this displayed when we were testing our sorting and then the title we had talked weeks ago about also displaying a a small description i don't i don't know that that's the best idea right now because there's a lot of pieces of content that don't have either don't have a description or worse they have a really weird description that's formatted weird it has strange html tags in it and even if we remove the html tags it would look even worse so i don't think we can do that now so the first thing we're going to do is just make it look good with the category and the title potentially the dates uh the dates really don't matter right now though because a lot of the content came over and they'll all have like the date when it was imported over to the new database and not the actual publish date so i don't know we'll see uh so i think that's all we're gonna have right now for the search results it's gonna be a little bear at some point it'd be great to get reasonable excerpts and descriptions for each page that comes up in these results but that's it just depends on you know who i can get to do that i mean i certainly don't think it's a good use of my time to go through and try to write that right now um all right so let's do that i don't really have any inspiration that i'm going with here or any vision in my head so i'm just gonna we're just gonna like get this design going as we go so i'm open to uh to any suggestions that you all have uh yeah uh angie says uh excited to watch this i've never done a code with me uh before i'm such a noob don't worry about it we're i i'm a noob too at many things so um i'm glad that you're here in the live chat feel free to ask any questions uh that uh that pop up i'm happy to go over anything um if um i'm being confused or anything like that all right so let's pull out this date first that'll do a lot to clean it up because the state's ugly uh we'll go over to the code let me know if this code is not big enough i may have to go bigger than normal because i can't get 1080p quality at home where are we at search and i'm gonna get rid of as much as i can okay so here's where we're should be below right oh no i yeah we moved our check boxes below the um the results okay so here's our results so here's the actual markup uh and we just used some divs we didn't even use any material ui components for right now i think this is okay uh i i don't think i want to make cards for each one of these we can try it if whatever we come up with right now doesn't really look great we can try to do cards but i don't think i think it'll just look cleaner like this so we'll see see how it goes so let's pull out the date right now we'll get rid of that if we do add it back in later we'll definitely make it look a lot nicer than it did we currently have where's this the type here let's see the type is a slightly different color it's a little bit gray but it might not be a bad idea to make this an entirely different color to maybe have it stand out a bit more so let's let's see what color should we like this um let's see what color we have we can make it this gold color let's see what it looks like with the gold and so we already have the classes uh type on here so we could just add to that class i think that's what we'll do all the way up to where we have type and let's go with color and yes what color do we have is it like theme i don't i'm not sure exactly what it's called but let's try theme api oops not api i don't know what i'm thinking theme color uh secondary let's see if that works and i forgot a comma that's why i'm getting that red error line um nikki says if a different color that same yellow is a student profile yes i thought about that did anything happen no nothing happened i wonder if we're using that i may have to look up what that is supposed to be i wonder if it'll give me um i guess we can look at material ui documentation and nikki i think you're right we could go with that color uh but i want to see how the gold looks so i i know that yellow sometimes is a bit hard uh to to make out on especially uh on older monitors so if the if the gold looks okay i think i'm gonna go with the gold and then we may end up changing the cards as well on the home page secondary all right yeah that was undefined all right hopefully it'll tell us primary palette okay maybe we gotta go palette then uh so we'll go theme palette secondary see if that works no it didn't look right secondary all right that looks better let's try it now see what we have should be getting a refresh soon i guess while i'm waiting for the refresh i'm gonna look back in here oh angie says is this a class with the font settings on its own um yeah so angie i'm not sure how much you know about react so this is probably gonna look weird let me see okay uh john i see john's already answered so i'll just kind of add to that as well so in react one of the ways you can do styles is to make a javascript object with css like properties so you can see this is it looks kind of like css but we're doing some stuff like with camel casing so i am just making a class called type basically and i'm setting the color to whatever color we have saved basically uh in as as this so instead of putting the hex value like we normally would then um hey ambrose my my threeyearold is trying to trying to get over here ambrose we can't watch any shows right now i'm doing a live stream on youtube okay so um anyway so that's all we're doing you know very very similar to what we do normally with css just to add the color to the class so yay finally so let's search and see hmm did it not work let's check out what's going on here in devtools and see why it's not working for us if i need let's get rid of the console here at the bottom you don't need that but we do need this and let's move this over okay all right so it looks like our color is not working i messed something up where did i mess up theme palette secondary oh i know what i messed up check this out so secondary does return an object just just like it it says here i i was looking right at it and just didn't realize it so i need to add main in order to return a string i was trying i was pulling in this entire object which obviously you know you can't pass objects as css property uh values so let's go with main and that should give us like the color uh in the color palette that we want michael creole says ambrose in the house yeah it was ambrose was trying to come in um yeah ambrose has been sad all day because he just wants to sit here in my chair with me and he wants me to put my little pony on one of my monitors i have three monitors here oh okay so our secondary color is that yellow color interesting yeah that's really hard to read like that we could maybe change the font weight and it might be a bit better but anyway i've been what i've been doing i've actually been using all three monitors and so i said you know hey i i we can't watch it today so he's pretty sad uh i guess i guess this mom won't put on my little pony upstairs for him all right okay that's much easier to read what do you think about this should we try to go with the gold or should we leave it like this all right nikki says team gold is better than yellow uh kishore says hey jesse you didn't post the url for your live code um yeah you know what i didn't i didn't set up uh ngrok on this computer so i i forgot to set it up and by the time i thought about it today i just i ran out of time also i'm not sure if this computer can handle running it since it's so slow already so i'm gonna try to to work out a way to run ngrok from home but for now i do not have it so sorry about that john hanson says do we get a vote for my little pony yeah if if you are my little pony fans uh let me know what your favorite pony is in the live chat or in the comments below and it'll be a great discussion um all right oh n is here she says hey hey anna how's it going all right gold it looks like gold is pretty much what everybody wants i don't think i saw anybody vote for yellow okay i don't know what color this really is yup it's like yellowy orange but i've just been calling it yellow all right so let's switch it up and do this gold i i wonder if we should just make gold the secondary color in the theme because it seems like nobody's really a fan of this color at all so let's do that let's just switch up in the theme to gold and that'll be cool because we haven't really done any work or even looked at the the theme in i don't know probably since it was first put in there uh so let's go i don't even remember where it is let's check it out is it here yep there it is here's our theme so here's our secondary wait is this a real thing okay are 500 that's interesting it's interesting that maine actually worked that's really weird is there somewhere else let me think all right john says five percent darker the gold will be easier to read it i did i do have a darker version of it that i've used elsewhere that is a lot easier to read but now i'm i'm really puzzled here so let me i don't know if i explain why i'm puzzled so uh we saw you know we can see here that like we brought this in and we have our palette primary like light main dark right but over here what we're seeing is is really different than that it's it's not it's not showing us those options which i'm a little confused about because how did it work when we said maine if this is what we have so i'm wondering if we have something else somewhere let's see let's see okay nothing here it's the last place we could check is here see if we pulled anything in here i guess not all right so we are pulling from here lid fps yeah i mean this this is where it's pulling from okay well i guess it our the equivalent of main would be this 500 so if we changed our 500 here maybe that would do something let's see what value we're getting right now i don't think it's that now this is a value you know what let me search for this value in our project and see if if it can come up so in visual studio code you can do a search throughout all the files in your project which is super helpful you can even do a replace that's how i um i ended up fixing a lot of the issues when we updated fus theme interesting okay so that's the color that we're getting here you know what i'm wondering i think it was harshit who did this uh i wonder if harshit took the main colors and um and then made all these variations i mean there's probably some tool that will make these variations for you that that might make more sense but since we see it here let's just let's try to manually change this to our our gold color which uh let me go my other screen and grab the hex value for that gold color so i do have an outdated style guide that i made over a year ago but it is useful to grab the hex codes so i'm looking at that right now and here we go all right so here's our hex code let's see if that makes a difference i mean it should be pretty obvious whether or not that's really where the color is coming from and if this doesn't work right now then i'm just going to put the hex code in manually and um just so that we can move on and see what it looks like i can always read through the documentation and material ui a little bit more later and you know try to add it into the theme that way okay hey it worked awesome all right so let's let's zoom out a bit and take a look at it so here's that gold color what do y'all think and i i realize i'm i'm not i'm missing things in the uh live chat now so uh i kind of couldn't keep up there so apologies if i am missing some advice but anyway you all can see the gold now my timer just went off so i'm gonna set the five minute timer and i'm gonna switch back to the screen so you can keep looking at the gold let me know what you think okay all right john says gold is gold is great angie said looking good all right cool cool cool when john says the color looks good i believe it right because john is an awesome artist so guaranteed he knows way more about colors and what looks good than than i do so um i'm gonna i'm gonna go with that who else uh nicole says yep that's good hey nicole how's it going uh welcome to the live chat so i think nicole and angie both i don't know that i've seen you in the live chat before apologies if you have been in the chat and i just didn't uh didn't see your message but uh if this is your first time chatting uh thank you and thanks for watching okay and john's saying you need that border top still okay yeah you're you're right we're gonna put in that border do you all remember on project one uh where we did those search listings we had a nice border uh who made that border shoot somebody in from the live chat did some work to make that border and i i modified it slightly but i can't remember now i mean obviously it shows who did it in github but uh anyway maybe we'll do something like that because i i really liked that border uh so all right cool we have um i think this is definitely better definitely an improvement so we're gonna keep that uh and this will match did we ever change these no we didn't so we may want if we're going with this color here we may want to think about you know do we want to change some colors here i'm gonna leave it for now but you know just some uh some options just got a message from work okay not really an issue okay and you know what i set that five minute timer and then didn't answer anything in the live chat so let me set that again because that's not fair to you all i'm gonna scroll up to the top of the chat try to get through as much as i can it looks like there's a lot in there so i may not be able to get to it all in this five minutes may have to wait till after the next session and let's see john says there he is bartholomew roberts a aka black bart you look like a pirate on the youtube preview yeah what do y'all think about that picture on the youtube preview i just i noticed that all my pictures started looking the same it's just like me smiling so i thought i'd do something goofy and different just to kind of break it up so uh yeah so i don't know if that's too silly let me know uh dt98 says what's this project all about um i'm making a new website for the university that i work for so it's a small university uh in uh ohio and their their main you know it's it's franciscan.edu is the website now so we're gonna replace that with this site um it's a react site and we get data from a wordpress content management system we pull it into react using graphql and apollo and we're using a material ui and following material design guidelines pretty closely you know there's we we have a little bit of room you know to do our own thing here but uh that's that's basically what we've we've been working on okay all right vippl says great videos but got too boring due to unnecessary chat and slow development all right thank you i appreciate the uh input there so uh anyway yeah let me know what you all think i i asked this question occasionally because this is not the first time uh that we've gotten some comments like that am i talking too much or is that a good thing in these videos and and i mean you know when we stop and do the question and answer stuff uh i do think the slow development is an issue uh i think the projects sometimes are unnecessary sl unnecessarily slow that's not always in my control you know sometimes like in this case the things happen and we had to kind of stretch out the the project so anyway not sure i can change the project timelines that much but i definitely could change about the talking so um if most of you think it's okay with the talking we'll keep going if you'd rather me cut back on that then i'll i'll think about doing that as well see uh okay uh michael and nikki are talking about attaching color values um here so you know what i did have a plugin that did that in atom i don't know if i have that in visual studio code um oh you know what nikki says it does that in css but not here all right so maybe i'd have to get some sort of separate plugin that would would do that also in javascript files okay john says it's called color highlight i'm not going to install it right now because i definitely don't need something else running even another plugin while we're trying to do this so i'm afraid it'll just freeze everything up uh chris barker asks why are we why are you using javascript to control css uh yeah so in react we use javascript to control everything so css html it's all javascript um so that's that's kind of the react way to do it you can use regular css and we are using that as well uh but wherever we can we're using javascript because that's the usual way to do things with with react all right wow i actually almost got all the way through all these so but the timer just just went off all right let me i'm going to try to remember where i left off so i didn't get to everything um so if you asked something i didn't get to it yet please hang in there and then after this next session i will answer those questions all right so now that we have uh this color here and then we still have the title we need to do we need to do two things one is really important and necessary the other one i definitely want to have as well but it's not a hundred percent necessary so the on the thing that's not 100 necessary is making that divider between each one we're going to do that uh if we have time but what we really need to do is we need some way for a user to click and get to the page right i've been thinking about this and a thought came to me i don't know a day or two ago and i added it in to an issue on github so let's open up github well we'll at least click to open it up and we'll come back to in a second uh so what we'll do is we'll make this title clickable we'll make it you know a link and then oops all right okay it finally opened okay cool um so i can find this issue it will jog my memory so i made sure i wrote it down in an issue so that i would not forget yeah here's how we're going to try to pull this off and we'll see if it works it's under the implement search okay so here and you all can read this too on your own it's you know the repos public uh link in the description so we're getting the data for this um you know from the wordpress api so what we'll have and we have already is the content type we're bringing that in we're already displaying that and then we're also bringing in the slug so if we have the content type and we have the slug for a lot of the content that's all we need to be able to recreate the correct route the correct url for this so let's try that see if it works and then we're probably going to find some cases where it doesn't work and then we can kind of modify things to try to fit those other cases so and if this is not making sense to you right now it hopefully it'll make sense once we start to actually use it uh and if it still doesn't make sense after we use it uh then i can explain it more just let me know in the chat i mean hopefully it works all right where are we at search okay so down here oh yes oops here we are okay i should probably pull this out of here so i can more easily get to it but it's all right now this this will probably end up being its own component at some point so here this span we're going to change into an a tag this is we're probably going to end up changing it into a link tag at some point but for testing i'm fine with just an a tag uh so we need an href and then our href we're going to put these back ticks so that we can do a template literal here because what we want is to do do we want we just want to do a slash for now and so we're going to have a slash and then we're going to use our template literal syntax to drop into javascript and actually oops my fault we need to go into javascript first to be able to use template literal syntax my fault okay if you're not familiar with template literal syntax put a question in the live chat and i'll explain it it's really cool and really useful so if you don't know about it i'm i'm more than happy to explain it because i i think it'll definitely you know benefit your coding uh if you know how to use it so we're going to try to recreate a route here so the first thing we need is item dot uh what did we call that uh type so item.type and then we're gonna put another slash and it's gonna be what is it going to be yeah anyway it just occurred to me how many like exceptions to this rule we're gonna have um so we have item.type and we're gonna have item dots and let's say that and see if it works and it hasn't refreshed yet so we'll have to give it a second okay all right cool so i have a few of you would like to know more about template little syntax so the refresh we're still waiting on the refresh so that'll give me a second to explain it so uh basically here's what you do so anywhere that you would normally use single quotes or double quotes in javascript you can instead use that backtick key and it's the little key right below your escape key right in the upper left hand corner your keyboard so uh it has the little uh like tioda uh character or uh it can be the back tick character so uh you use that and then within it you can type a string just like normal but you can also put a dollar sign and then curly brackets and within the curly brackets you can write javascript so this is useful in situations where let's say like normally we could have done it like this so we could have written href equals um and then you know put our normal quotation marks and then we would have had to put a slash and then we would have had to put a plus sign and then our item dot type and then the plus sign and then our slash and then a plus sign and then our item dot slug right well instead of having to put all those plus signs in different quotes we can just do it like this and it may not seem like we've saved a lot of space there but if you start adding a lot more in it definitely does save space and the other cool thing that we can do here is i could potentially put in a lot of like html in the string with spaces like i can hit enter here and this would still work normally you can't do that uh with strings so you can essentially create html templates with javascript variables in it and and use you know indentation and um line breaks right so you could hit enter and have them on multiple lines to make it look like real html so it's very helpful especially like if you're not using react and you you know you just want to make a quick you know template with some variables in it very useful so the that's template literal syntax um so you look that up if you want a better explanation you know i'm sure there are probably a lot of better like blogs and videos that explain it better than i can but that's just kind of a brief overview of how you would use that and why am i getting an error trailing spaces are not allowed okay at a trailing space all right um let's go and hopefully this is refreshed yeah it refreshed and it looks so ugly that's fine for now i'm okay with with it looking ugly but here's what we have see so now now it takes us to say major anthropology and this says department uh biology header let's try to find it one where this will actually work so biology department text there we go so department biology probably will work let's try it so let's click it and hopefully i have the data in there with the right slug no errors yet ah no okay so there was the air let's go back and try to find one where it works oh so slow all right look there again let's see see some of the times it's not gonna work so like right here we have department slash departments is the url okay so it's not gonna work for that uh oh we do have faculty this one should work all right yeah let's click on this one so for faculty member dr eric haney i know we have the data for him because we used him uh as an example for a while so slow so slow so if anyone is watching right now that is wealthy and really impatient and you'd like this to be sped up you can donate to the get a better computer so jesse can live stream faster from home fund so let me know i can give you my paypal and my wallet addresses for a variety of cryptocurrencies alright cool so that did work so this should work for all faculty members student profiles departments and for majors it's going to work but it's going to work a little differently so essentially there'll be two different urls that we can use to get to majors so what we'll need to do to get this to work for more things and i think the simplest way to get it to work is just to add to our um our server and our routing function that that translation object we're gonna have to add some more items to that object to have alternate urls for certain things that fit with this it's going to be a little bit weird to do that but the alternative is i don't i think it would be very complicated to try to switch things around and have like special rules for each content type so for now that's what what i'm going to do uh matt duchess says sorry got a jet catch y'all later thanks jesse uh you're welcome thanks for watching i'll see you um okay so cool so the concept works excellent there are some cases that aren't working properly we'll need to take care of that probably won't have time this stream yeah about 12 minutes left so i'm not going to get into the the more like edge cases right now that's something i think maybe i'd like to think about more um let you all think about it as well if you have any ideas michael creel says department slash departments work works yes sweet alright awesome so departments slash departments works so maybe there won't be as many cases as i i don't know exactly why that works but i'm not complaining blake says i love that idea but i don't have a lot of money yeah i don't i'm i'm like half joking with that as well so like please don't don't feel bad for me that my computer is too slow to stream like seriously only if there's somebody out there that like hit it big with crypto or something and like literally has thousands of dollars just to throw away like then i would i would i would accept that okay but i don't want any of you like uh you know who who aren't like very wealthy attempting to give me money for something because uh uh you know like i make enough money to support me and my family with you know a little bit left over so i'm not poor i don't you know i don't need uh i i don't want any of you who potentially make less money than me you know donating to to my cause uh i would just i'd feel terrible about that so anyway um let's uh let's see it pulls wp test tv with the department center and academics okay so michael said it it is pulling some data um okay cool well let's yeah let's bring this up again then and the last thing we'll do i do i see there's some more questions in the chat i will get to those in about 10 minutes uh what we really ought to do now is style this so that we don't have these really uh kind of ugly old school looking uh links so let's style that a bit and that'll probably be all we get to today which i think is significant you know we actually have functional links on our search page so let's let's go back here and i can get rid of this and let's see classes title so let's go up to our our class for title here where we have our css and so we still have the right font size the right font weight so we should only have to change the color and then we'll set this the text decoration to none okay that'll get rid of our underline and then our color should be you know what there's probably a match let's let's check our color page for whoops from material ui to see if there's something that we should use um where's our default or text um no i don't want gray hmm interesting okay so uh there probably is something within material ui that i could use but just since we're kind of running out of time i'm just going to use for color let's do rgb a and let's give it 0 0 0 right that'll give us black wait there's no commas is there i always want to put commas in there and then it doesn't work zero zero zero and then the last one is our um like our transparency value uh so we're going to set this to 0.87 and that's kind of the standard the reason we want to do this instead of just doing a gray hex value is because now that i see that i think i should put commas i'm so i'm i don't know what i'm doing like you do a thing so many times and it's like uh there are commas okay thank you nikki and michael says opacity that's the word i was looking for so opacity so anyway if you use a gray hex color it's much harder to read than if you use black with an opacity setting uh it will look grey but it'll be much more readable so always try to do that if you can if you have if you want gray text and if you don't believe me try it out try out a gray hex right next to an equivalent rgba black with opacity set at whatever to get that same color and it's amazing the first time i tried it and saw the difference i was wow i don't know why i don't know why it does that but you can check that out that's that's i didn't invent that that's straight out of the material design documentation all right anyway uh so i guess we'll have to wait for the uh reload um yeah but that should be fine why is our is our font weight while we're waiting let's inspect this and make sure font weight isn't there you go no it looks like it's it's it's in there all right cool there we are so now you can see we have our color okay so it's it it looks pretty dark like almost black but it's not black uh and great very cool um no i mean it may not be like 100 immediately noticeable like oh hey that's a link we'll just have to see i'd like to maybe do some testing with users and just tell them to do a search and not say anything and just see where they go to click if they immediately go and try to click the title they think it'll be okay if they like try to click on something else first i don't know we'll see uh maybe we'll have to change the color um let's see let me check alright about four minutes all that time to wait for an error that i knew was coming okay well i don't i don't think i have time to implement the um that border like uh between you that little line separating each each item uh so five minute yeah and then actually it's less than four now so i'm just gonna go ahead and and start answering questions now so cut that pomodoro session just a bit short oh you know what and i always forget to do this let's let me take the last minute or so of the session to um uh commit this and then push it to github and that way you know you all will have a chance to review anything that we've done and it's a lot easier if you wanted to try to like use some of this on your own it's a lot easier to copy and paste from github instead of trying to type out what's on the video so in my terminal which it's a little bit small there so sorry if you can't read that right now but i'm going to say what i'm writing anyway so we're going to do a git status just to see what we've done and we've changed that fus theme dot js and we've changed search.js so i always like to verify that first and then that way if i've accidentally changed some other file and i didn't realize it uh then i can i can tell i mean it it rarely happens but occasionally you know you it it does happen sometimes so before we commit that and mess something up always check so now we'll do a git add and that adds those changes to the staging area so these are staged now ready to commit and i'm going to say do yarn cm and that's a special tool that we have here that helps us to write a good commit message if you don't have that tool you can just type git commit and then you can put hyphen m and then in quotation marks you can write your commit message right there in line it'll do the same thing as what we're doing now except you'll write your commit message all yourself instead of having this little walkthrough so we've added new features and what we've done is styled styled search results and we haven't broken anything does it change any open issues uh i suppose if we want to say that implement search issue which is 74 we can reference that issue um so let's say yes and let's put number 74 um actually number 74 and hit enter all right and now it'll run through and we have our project set up to do some testing and auto formatting the code so if you download this if you clone this repo and start working on it it will auto format your code it will link your code it will run tests so just be aware of that it could take a while depending on the speed of your computer so if you want to take this project and do something else with it on your own maybe you might want to disable that maybe you don't like the style we use that's totally fine but if you are going to try to submit code to this project which is totally cool if you want to do that that would be awesome just be aware that that does need to run uh because we want to keep everything really uniform as much as possible so you can code in whatever style you like but then when you go to commit it'll reformat to the style that we're using on this project which is the standard js style the biggest thing you'll notice about that is that we don't use semicolons all right so i'm just going to let that go while i go back to the live chat my pomodoro session just ended and let me scroll up to where i left off and answer some questions okay so all right so angie uh says never uh never been before thanks for the welcome i'm really new to coding and i'm trying to gain confidence oh awesome uh well i i hope that this is a place that can help you get some confidence and um yeah don't worry any questions are totally fine uh i i love getting questions and i'm very happy to explain what's going on i want this to be as beginner friendly as possible um yeah and let me know if there's anything i can do to make the stream better for you and uh if it if it's possible i'll definitely try it out uh chris barker says do you have to use javascript to control css and react no you don't you can use regular css and just you know import it as normal you could use sas if you wanted to so yeah you don't have to to use it like that react is very flexible when it comes to how you want to do css it actually has it has so many options for how to do css like i i can't even keep track of them all and all through our projects uh that we've done on the live stream i think we've used a different some different way to do css on everyone it seems like we're always trying out something something new let's see it says michael says jesse regarding the preview uh there are there are new women in here today just saying all right i don't michael let me know what you were saying there i'm not i'm not exactly sure what you say are you saying that i should do like my normal thing where i tell everybody what the streams about that i usually forget to do for the new people anyway let me let me know i guess it's kind of late in the stream to do that i'll have to remember to do it next time though i need to just write a little script so i can just go through it i've been streaming for almost a year now you think i would have sorted that out uh jason lee says from columbus ohio oh awesome awesome jason yeah so i'm i'm in steubenville ohio uh so like right um right there on the border between ohio and west virginia and pennsylvania is right there as well who is that cordelia my my oneyearold is trying to come in here now hi cordelia she's really upset because the door is closed so she can't get in uh nikki says try giving that gold text uh the css letter spacing 1.4 okay cool i'll keep in mind to mess with the letter spacing there hey you got the door open no no no come here you want to you want to see data come here do you want me to hold you no you just want to get all my cups she's down here here do you want to be on youtube here it's okay i'm almost done all right hey everybody this is cordelia could do you say hi you say hi wave right there wave right there hello hi all right can you can you say hello all right what what do you want you you want milk i don't have any milk do you want to go upstairs and get your milk from mama okay go ahead go ahead go get it good girl all right so that was cordelia that's my my baby uh all right sorry about that let me find my place okay uh matt duchess says you do you no such thing is too silly all right so that was when i was asking if my my picture was too silly today so thank you um let's see uh nikki says it makes all caps a bit easier to read if they're spaced out a bit more oh okay cool that makes sense that totally makes sense anna says i like when you talk too much all right thanks and i appreciate the the input um i usually when in the past every time that somebody has suggested that i talk less and code more um i've gotten a bunch of people saying no i actually like the talking that's what's unique about this stream that i do take the time to answer all the questions and explain things so if i keep getting that reaction then i'll i'll keep talking um i think the pomodoro method that we're using here does help to keep a balance so i guess i'll keep going with that and for those of you that would prefer less talking and more coding um you can always uh wait and watch the recordings you can watch it on like two time speed i've heard that i'm you can still understand me at two time speed probably because i don't talk very fast normally uh and then you can skip the breaks whenever i'm talking so you know maybe that might make things a little bit less boring for you uh but if it is too boring i totally understand there's so many other really useful videos out there like go you can watch those and it it'll be fine you gotta find the tools that work for you um so i totally understand that um matt duchess says talking is preferred it helps to see your thought process cool angie says you you haven't confused me yet i think you're fine uh blake says i like the talking uh development isn't slow necessarily but it is a little during the live streams uh by the way the stream quality is good awesome okay yeah um all right well i will keep talking then um okay angie asks uh what to react okay cool so john says you can go to react.js.org which is great um let me give you um just a brief explanation of what react is uh so certainly you'll get a better explanation at react.js.org but just for you and anybody else that's watching it's not familiar with react react is a javascript library that allows you to make uh web applications and it takes care of a lot of the behind the scenes thing that sometimes things that can be really tricky uh so updating the state of your application uh manipulating the dom so the document object model basically the elements the html elements that are on the page so those are just some of the things that it does it can do a lot more kind of behind the scenes what it's doing is you're writing javascript functions and then those functions are adding the html elements to the page but it looks still a lot like html because there's this layer on top of it called jsx that makes it way easier to use so you can write what seems like normal html but in reality you're writing javascript functions so reacts uh the some of the benefits of react are um you have these components that are really easy to reuse uh you can have large projects still be like manageable uh you can it it's fast like things happening on the page happen really fast so i don't want to get too indepth i said it would be a short explanation but that's that's some of what react is you've probably seen a lot of websites that use react uh facebook users react um uh trying to think instagram at least the web version of instagram is react i don't know if the app is react native or not uh let's see what else is react netflix uses react uh godaddy's website is react i'm trying to think what uh i'm like blanking out here but there are a lot of websites that use uh react right now so if you haven't heard of it you know you've at least probably seen it without even realizing uh nino says is the github thing that helps you push better github commits available for npm yeah it is so it's uh committed let me bring up on the screen my package.json file i should just leave that file up all the time because i it seems like i always refer to it at some point so committed commitizen um and then uh cz conventional change log so those i believe it's those two packages that are doing most of that and then it's tied in i i think with our precommit hook so the documentation for committees should cover a lot of which you need to set it up and you can check out our project to see you know how we've set it up as well but um yeah if you want to see version numbers and stuff and copy and paste it check out the package.json file in in this github repo oh nikki i just saw that you already answered nina's question so sorry about that thank you nikki for answering that oh okay so nikki i didn't realize so for those of you that use the azerty keyboard instead of the qwerty keyboard keyboard um the backtick is next to the enter key and it's via alt gr so for qwerty users the way i explained it earlier is where you get it but no i guess not so for everyone else so thanks nikki i was not aware of that all right almost to the bottom of the chat so if you have a question you haven't put it in there yet um get it in there quickly because once i get to the bottom i'll um i'll end the stream and if you're watching this later on and want to ask a question please put it in the comments or you can ask me the question um through any uh social media channel that you can find me at uh if you check out the link to my youtube channel from there i have linked all my different social media profiles so reach out to me however you would like uh it doesn't matter to me whatever is best for you and i'll do my best to get back to you as soon as i can uh carlos says hi jesse what back end are you using what's the setup for your front end uh sorry if you've said this before okay so i had some um some answers to this in the live chat but let me just give a really brief overview for everyone so front end is react the back end is for at least for the react stuff is we were using nodes we're using node and express um to handle a lot of stuff a lot of routing and things like that and then separate from there located on an entirely different server is a wordpress installation that we're just using to handle the data we're not using any of like wordpress themes or anything like that and so that's the setup so the data database is tied in with wordpress so essentially we just use wordpress to manage the database so mysql database we pull data out of that mysql database using graphql we pull that into our react app the only exception being on our search page we don't use graphql we just use the standard rest api for wordpress um nikki asked when i was talking about the difference between gray text and black text with um opacity at i mean we use values like 0.87 for normal text 0.54 for um for input text but nikki says what's the reason it looks more readable better antialiasing or something i'm teddy truth i'm not really sure uh michael says just a guess but it's not as hard as the solid gray since it's slightly seethrough it could be yeah michael says just realize you're using the second terminal michael says no the picture what picture oh i know now so when you're talking about explain the preview all right yeah so so the preview thumbnail for the video i took a goofy picture of my face because just to switch things up like because i normally just take the same type of picture of just me smiling so anyway i just thought i'd be goofy today to change things up but this is like somewhat of a serious stream though so angie says my brother lives in yellow springs ohio okay cool yeah it's always fun to learn where people are from because sometimes it's like find out people are actually like close to where i'm at or like really cool one day i think it would be super awesome to have some type of meetup for all the people that like watch the stream uh either like maybe if i'm traveling somewhere and it's in a location where a lot of you are or something like that i mean maybe it'll just be every time i travel somewhere i'll let you all know where i'm going and anybody that's close we can just like hang out or something uh if any of you would be up for that let me know i just think it'd be fun like to actually hang out in person um at some point since i mean like we we spent a lot of time together online doing these streams so uh it would be it would be kind of cool uh kishore says uh how to make a react app into a progressive web app which is popping up on dev blog hey baby you want to be on youtube um yeah so kishore's talking about that yeah so there is a recent article uh i didn't read it yet but it does talk about how to turn a react app into progressive web app um yeah so check that out if you're interested in that it is actually really easy so uh we've done it before uh so if you check out most of the projects that we've done um that's actually been done usually harshit takes care of that um but yeah it's it's just a few extra lines and it's it's really cool uh a lot of you were saying hi to cordelia and saying she was cute so thank you thank you i appreciate it um yeah i just love that little girl i was spoiler so much i hope she turns out all right but she's just my baby and uh she just she wants me to hold her all the time i just can't like i can't say no to her she's so cute um carlos says hello from switzerland hey how's it going hey this is uh this is gemma this is my oldest daughter you wanna say hi gemma hi and gemma maybe wants to be a coder too when she grows up i think i might go to a coding club today you're gonna go to coding club today i think so i think it's tomorrow huh i think it's tomorrow morning yeah so gemma's gonna go to a coding club tomorrow you're gonna come with us yeah and you're gonna code well i'm yeah i'm not gonna code i'm gonna come with you and and hang out and help you out yeah all right you can hang out here while i'm i'm doing this if you want or you can go play i have the i have students on lexi i mean ar they are at um library they are what at library um they are on the computers at library um it's this thing where you um read a book and then you have to take a test on the on the chromebooks um on the book and you're not allowed to look at the book and uh i pretty much always get um all that right good job baby yeah gemma is very smart and always gets good grades except for the one time i got a c i see that happens sometimes that's okay and once i thought i got a c but it was actually charlie's paper yeah okay all right well if you want to stay down here i'm gonna finish this soon so i gotta answer a few more questions okay hey you got mcdonald's coffee i got mcdonald's coffee this morning after i took you to school all right let me answer these questions okay sorry about the the camera moving uh so i'm gonna try to get a stationary camera soon uh because i don't want to make any of you motion sick okay um oh anna says uh i enjoy your english oh thank you i uh i guess i guess it's okay english i try do you even speak english who that person who said anna yeah julie yeah you remember anna you talked to her i didn't speak english she was the one who said she was going to teach me the other language i think yeah oh yeah i remember her yeah try not to move around a lot you're actually making me motion sick okay i get motion sick very very easily it's like you okay yeah all right this just has a hole in the chair oh nikki says visual studio code tip control clicking on a component name brings you to that file interesting let's let's try it that sounds really cool so uh let's see if i have component name i may not have my own component name in here or a component in here at all i should try index that's that's probably where i have okay so let's control click definition i guess it didn't nope didn't work for me let me try command since i'm on a mac command click ctrl click hmm okay it didn't work for me yeah did you a box just popped up yeah they can teleport they can see it this is what they see on the screen all right michael says regarding graphql oops my window my chat window just jumped down to the bottom so i lost track where i was there we go so michael says regarding graphql i've sort of gotten a hand on it but can't figure out how to connect the the test wordpress database you set up i can hard code the search result url but not search your main url huh um so do i need to have admin rights to do the search on wordpress or is there a graphql plugin that i might need maybe dada you um you know what you could um let the computer um let him in to your thing well we could let me hmm let me i'm trying to think over this look at the problem could be so maybe they're not allowed to do that so they because they might mess a mess everything up um i think that like why but he's not gonna ask anything i'm not saying now okay so you're saying so the search results work for you but the graphql stuff doesn't is that let me know because like the the search uses the rest api so that should work right off the bat with any wordpress instance it should be fine um the graph the graphql should work too i'm i'm not sure why it wouldn't be working i don't have any like restrictions or limitations set on it at least not right now what if everyone was who was doing it was just right next to your computer yeah that would be crazy if they all right let me let me answer these questions then we can talk okay what are other questions there's all right here there's more questions see um yeah so they're waiting for me to answer the questions so i don't want to make them wait for too long okay that's a ton of questions all right well let's get through them uh le levitt says vim awesome also uses react cool very cool um blake says i ended up getting a surface pro 2 again okay cool blake let me know how that goes for you um and how you like it uh psy sai i'm not sure how to pronounce that let me know if i pronouncing it wrong but anyway so i says uh learning a lot of things awesome uh i'm super glad whenever somebody learned something from these streams so i imagine that you all don't always learn it from me there's a lot of really smart people on the live chat giving um some some good information but as long as you learn something yeah they're smarter than gummy me i don't have any gummy bears down here can i get go back upstairs uh think about it let's talk to your mom uh let's see nikki says i was watching a tutorial and the instructor used it without mentioning it my mind was blown it was so cool okay that was the uh the tip in visual studio code that i couldn't get to work but i'm probably just doing something wrong so i'll have to try it again later your coffee yeah you know what there's coffee grounds in the bottom so you can i didn't even realize there's anything left i thought i drank it all if you don't if you don't want the coffee grounds it's fine i'll just i'll drink it i don't mind it when i was little mama used to mama once gave me a haul like different a whole like like a little jar of coffee and i drank it all wow okay listen listen remember coffee gemma remember we're gonna talk later okay all right thank you um i'm gonna say one more thing my shoes kept getting untied in school oh okay well you have to you have to double knot them you know how to double knot double knotting all right well we're not doubling mine um okay well we can we can test test out some notes later okay um uh dev moore says hi new here and to react i was wondering if it's a good idea to go through your earlier projects it could be the only thing about some of the earlier projects are so i've been streaming for almost a year now so some of the things that we did early on are outdated so you know a lot of the packages that we've used have have new changes and and some of the changes are breaking changes uh even react has has come you know when we started this that was prereact 16. baby you gotta let me talk i wanna say one more thing can it wait no so after no so anyway you can look you can probably still get some good info from the previous projects but just be aware that some of that stuff may be outdated um so if if you're okay with that then yeah go ahead and watch some of the previous stuff i probably do a better job of explaining things earlier on and like as i've gone on i kind of just stopped explaining like the same thing over and over again i have two things to say why don't you write down what you want to say so you don't forget and then we can talk about it after um well the world says did you become a remote worker uh yeah so i'm semi remote right now uh so i'll probably be spending like a few days a week at home a few days in the office uh carlos says thanks for explaining very intricate back end routing and stuff from wordpress to node.js express and then react cool yeah it's it's a little bit more complicated than probably most uh university websites are but i think the results are gonna be they're gonna be worth it as long as you don't get on my computer i'm all right with that um yeah so i think the results gonna be a very fast and flexible website john says jesse have you seen the movie brainstorm a scary precursor to your new headset i haven't seen it maybe i have to check it out if it's on netflix i'll check it out yeah actually so i got the headset in the mail today so if if you want to know more i have a project where i'm going to work with a uh brain computer interface to try to help my son raphael with his uh his mental illness he has obsessive compulsive disorder um and get some anxiety you can use yeah you can use it too so i'm gonna be working on that project uh i'll i'll probably be putting some videos on my own youtube channel about it so if you're interested you can subscribe to my youtube channel the links in the description and um i'll be doing videos on that soon i'd like to work on it like later today and tomorrow if i can uh so anyway um i don't know hopefully i can help my son and then maybe help other people too if if it works but anyway if you want to know more about it watch yesterday's stream because i i explain more in depth what i want to do and there is a conversation on twitter more about it too so uh if you want to check out my twitter it's it's a somewhat recent tweet there's a kind of a big conversation going on there um blake says the meetup would be cool cool cool that's well i'll definitely let you all know whenever i'm going right now i'm the closest big city i am that i'm to is pittsburgh so if any of you gemmas is too loud you see the red for the microphone thing when it gets to red it's too loud why we don't want it to get to the red it's like the noise meter at school except there are a ton of balls okay remember you're gonna write down you're going to write i wanted to go on all the way down no no you're going to hurt everybody's ears i'm going to have to i might have to turn down the mic here let me turn it down a bit hopefully you can still hear me hey yeah damn angel i'm not gonna let you be down here for these if you don't quit talking okay and don't don't shake the chair baby i like having you on here but you gotta listen okay um where are we at oh anyway if anybody is in or around the pittsburgh area now or if you're ever traveling around there definitely let me know because it wouldn't be that hard for me to uh drive up and and you know meet up there all right blake's in upstate south carolina cool i may be in charleston later i'm thinking about going to a conference in charleston i haven't bought tickets yet though but i'll let you know if i go i mean i know charleston isn't isn't really uh that is rich upstate but it's closer than where i am now dad is rich you think i'm rich you're rich oh yeah you're a rich man with a beard on your head okay remember we're gonna write down our ideas what we want to talk about write them down oh yeah john says basically create react app out of the box builds a progressive web app automatically yeah you know what you are right john uh that's true like you have everything you need for a progressive web app yeah right mr john gemma michael cruz says uh have franciscan university host a conference and pay for us to get there it really wouldn't be that many people think how much we could do on a hackathon over the over a weekend oh actually that's a great idea yeah right michael gemma or my channel whatever your name is do you go upstairs no all right so i had an idea and i presented it to the head of my department at franciscan gemma why don't you go play in the other room and i'll come get you when i'm done nope i'm saying you're going to hurt everybody's ears when you scream like that because they probably have headphones on okay okay i don't want you hurting everybody's ears okay all right okay okay uh you're not gonna get any any gummy bears if you scream anymore okay no gummy bears all right you gotta be a good girl then i wouldn't make it all the way to that yellow no all right so here was my idea uh i had an idea to start a boot camp like a coding boot camp a code school at franciscan so it wouldn't be for actually you know university credit and that would actually be an advantage because being accredited uh and all that means like we'd have to have people with masters and phds teaching um and the the process to get courses approved is really really slow but if we did it as this separate entity kind of like catechetical institute did that site that we did for them they're an institute people don't get real degrees through there they get a certificate it would be somewhat like that but it would be tied into franciscan so since i wouldn't be like a real professor i could teach there or you know other people you know could teach that don't necessarily need to have a degree so anyway i thought it would be cool and then we could branch out like start with web dev stuff but branch out into maybe like some other cool things like machine learning and then that way like i don't know i think it could be useful uh i think people might might like that and it could be good for the university too so i just need to tell the right people i guess and get it started probably find donors who are willing to donate to get it started as well but um i think it'd be cool all right i'm gonna read it after after gemma and angie said hello and john said hello carlos too i thought i said mr johnny see your beard's getting in my face it's not even your bearded your hair what technically your beard in your hair i think there's a line right there i like that i might have just made a lightweight they said that you sound smart who said that was that who said that was that mr j johnson yeah that was mr johnny hi mr johnny all right anna says you're so cute crazy says uh what's up hey how's it going thanks for joining in the the live chat cornelia is coming you want us you want to be you want to what's that cchs crusaders oh okay that's the um central yeah the catholic the catholic high school here in stephenville is is catholic central high school and the mascot is the crusaders so cchs crusaders say hi michael says my youngest has autism along with adhd so your project sounds interesting oh yeah i mean i i don't have any medical background i don't have experience with this yet but i did i i don't know i the idea makes sense that it could happen it just it's just a matter of if i can get reliable consistent data from this headset if not like i might have to buy a more expensive headset to get good data but i think like um jose says cool stuff regards from el salvador hey how's it going uh let's see javascript says hey i was born and lived until age four in charleston oh cool you probably don't remember that much if you left at age four but i think charleston is one of my favorite cities really beautiful city especially in the spring yeah you see the headphones you wanna wear them all right blake says do i get a name i guess not she left and blake says family reunion uh blake also said hey jesse that sounds like a cool project what language are you using we're actually gonna use javascript so um alex castillo has done a lot of work with us already and uh he has some github repos where he's able to get the data and use javascript to display it uh like on a website like on a web app so that's that's we're going to use it's going to be cool and all right so i've gotten to the bottom of the live chat so i'm going to end this cordelia you want to say goodbye say goodbye to everyone say bye bye uh noble and savage is just here so jesse i always miss your streams i'm sorry about that hopefully you can you can make it for a stream sometime soon all right so i am going to i am going to end the stream and oh it's friday i was about to say i'll be back tomorrow but it's friday so i'll be back um on monday uh if i have time and i work on that headset project the brain computer interface thing this weekend then maybe i'll do a stream on that on my channel we'll see how it goes i'd like to do at least a video for my channel sometime soon uh so if i hopefully i'll have time uh if not i'll see you all on monday yeah until then uh have a wonderful weekend and thank you all so much for watching and uh for uh all your advice on the live chat uh really appreciate it as always and i can't find the button to stop the streams all right i'm leaving for real now see ya
