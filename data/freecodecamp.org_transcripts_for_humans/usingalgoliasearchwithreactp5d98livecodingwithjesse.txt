00:05 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:06 - with jesse i'm jesse and today
00:09 - we're going to work on something that i
00:11 - think is really cool
00:14 - we're going to make our search function
00:17 - a lot better because we're going to use
00:20 - algolia
00:21 - and i'll explain what that is
00:24 - but we're going to use algolia to handle
00:27 - all our our search um
00:30 - all like
00:31 - getting all the data going through it
00:33 - all and providing the results and we're
00:35 - just gonna display it
00:37 - with react
00:39 - so that's the plan for today
00:41 - uh first of all i just want to say thank
00:45 - you to everybody uh yesterday who
00:48 - uh provided some encouragement and
00:51 - support to me on twitter and instagram
00:55 - so
00:56 - as many of you know i launched this
00:58 - project last week the one that we've
01:00 - been working on for so long
01:03 - um
01:04 - and
01:06 - so i i got a lot of positive feedback
01:09 - but i did get some negative feedback and
01:12 - um
01:12 - some of it was was very constructive and
01:15 - good and i'm okay with that uh but some
01:17 - of it was
01:18 - um
01:20 - a little bit
01:21 - more mean spirited i guess and didn't
01:24 - really even contain anything
01:26 - constructive
01:28 - um so that was kind of getting me down
01:31 - and i think i've just been stressed
01:32 - because i've been working a lot
01:34 - a lot more than than usual
01:38 - i wasn't feeling well uh because my even
01:40 - though i've i have been trying to
01:42 - exercise regularly i think my immune
01:44 - system was just wearing down so
01:46 - all these factors just combined at the
01:48 - point of yesterday morning
01:50 - i was just feeling down and it just was
01:52 - like
01:54 - you know little bugs in the site kept
01:56 - coming and i kept getting comments from
01:59 - people through email and social media
02:01 - and things that uh you know negative
02:03 - feedback and so i knew
02:06 - like
02:07 - you know i just i know how i am and with
02:09 - my history of depression i knew
02:11 - i got to do something or else i'm going
02:13 - to get really depressed here i'm not
02:14 - going to be able to function so
02:16 - that's why i um i reached out to you all
02:19 - uh on social media and just
02:23 - i'm just you all responded just
02:25 - overwhelmingly
02:26 - and
02:27 - i
02:28 - thank you thank you i really appreciate
02:30 - it and it definitely helped
02:32 - uh it helped me to feel a lot better i
02:35 - mean some of the messages were just
02:36 - amazing and there were some people like
02:38 - i had no idea that some people
02:41 - even knew
02:42 - who i was or watched the show or that i
02:45 - impacted them at all and it was awesome
02:47 - to hear that so i don't want to spend
02:49 - too much time and not do any coding but
02:51 - i just i had to say thank you to you all
02:53 - because that
02:55 - uh it really meant a lot to me and i'm
02:58 - i'm going to be going back and looking
02:59 - at those messages probably many times to
03:02 - you know just give me some motivation
03:05 - and and help me
03:06 - you know stay focused on you know just
03:08 - trying to do the best i can
03:11 - so
03:12 - anyway
03:14 - um
03:16 - i see we have a lot of people here so
03:18 - i'm sure there's new people uh let me
03:20 - explain briefly what's going on here i'm
03:23 - a front-end developer i'm employed
03:24 - full-time at a small university and this
03:27 - is me doing my everyday work i'm in my
03:29 - office right now
03:31 - i'm about to work on a project
03:33 - the main website for this university
03:35 - that we just launched last week
03:37 - and uh so this is not a tutorial but i
03:40 - do my best to try to explain what i'm
03:42 - doing and i'm welcome to any questions
03:44 - that you have just let me know i'll take
03:46 - breaks periodically and answer questions
03:48 - at the end if there are any questions
03:50 - left i'll answer all your questions
03:55 - so hopefully you can still learn
03:56 - something from me or from the other
03:58 - people in the chat
04:00 - um
04:01 - even though
04:03 - right it's we're kind of going in the
04:05 - middle of the project right we've been
04:06 - working on this project for a really
04:08 - long time this is video 98
04:13 - so yeah so that's what we're gonna do
04:15 - i'm gonna set a timer here in just a
04:17 - minute and we're gonna start with the
04:19 - code and i'm gonna kind of ignore the
04:21 - chat for a little bit while i code
04:23 - uh and then i'll come back to the chat
04:25 - and catch up on things so let me just
04:28 - very briefly just check out who's in the
04:30 - chat now and say hello
04:32 - uh hey i see a lot of you you're saying
04:34 - hi
04:35 - how's it going
04:37 - um
04:38 - i see there are some questions
04:41 - uh there are a few questions about why
04:43 - i'm using algolia over elasticsearch
04:47 - um
04:48 - so let me address this since it it's
04:50 - definitely gonna deal directly with uh
04:52 - what we're doing
04:53 - um
04:54 - i've tell you truth um i'm really
04:58 - impressed with algolia and
05:01 - yesterday i already put a bunch of data
05:03 - in there uh so i like what i see so
05:06 - i'm open to elasticsearch maybe in the
05:09 - future
05:10 - if i learn more about it and figure out
05:12 - that's a better way to go i'm definitely
05:14 - open to it but for now this is a feature
05:17 - that i really want to get live as soon
05:19 - as possible i'm not satisfied at all
05:21 - with the search that i created before
05:25 - it worked well for some of our previous
05:27 - projects because there was a small
05:28 - amount of data but with such a large
05:30 - amount of data with this site it just
05:32 - does not work
05:34 - there's there's too much
05:37 - it there's too much data
05:38 - for a user to be able to find what
05:40 - they're looking for
05:42 - you know the search we did before was
05:43 - just very simple if that word existed
05:46 - in that particular post it would show up
05:50 - well we're talking about thousands of
05:51 - posts here
05:52 - uh so a user's not gonna be able to
05:55 - scroll through all those
05:57 - uh so this is gonna help and and you'll
06:00 - see uh i'll show you what we can do with
06:02 - this data uh in a little while so if
06:05 - you're still confused about what algolia
06:07 - is or what it's going to do just stick
06:08 - around
06:10 - you know you'll see it in action
06:13 - okay
06:14 - so any of the other questions in there
06:16 - right now i'm going to get to those
06:17 - after we do our first coding session
06:20 - so let me switch my screens here you can
06:22 - see this is the site this morning i
06:25 - added a feature where
06:26 - different images would show up
06:28 - so it's kind of just a random
06:31 - as to what image shows up just a simple
06:33 - uh you know math
06:35 - math.random and uh in javascript and i
06:39 - just put all the images in an array and
06:42 - so
06:43 - it just does a random it grabs a url
06:45 - from the array and puts it in as the
06:47 - background image
06:48 - so if you click
06:50 - you get different images
06:53 - sometimes you click and it's the same
06:54 - one obviously because it's random
06:56 - so i just have some different i had some
06:58 - feedback on the images and they said
07:00 - it'd be nice to get images from
07:02 - different parts of campus and about
07:04 - different things going on um i did i
07:06 - definitely i got
07:08 - the most vocal feedback and this
07:10 - actually came from some students where
07:13 - um where actually they said well you
07:15 - know we're we're a catholic college but
07:17 - it doesn't really say anything about us
07:19 - being catholic on the uh main page
07:22 - except for this little thing right here
07:24 - and that was actually true
07:26 - uh it was kind of
07:28 - not really my intention to to do that i
07:30 - just kind of wanted to highlight all of
07:32 - our degrees because
07:34 - i wanted people to know we have really
07:36 - good academics here uh and from our
07:38 - research it showed that that was an area
07:40 - that we could improve on uh in terms of
07:42 - the public's opinion of our university
07:45 - uh but i threw some pictures in there
07:47 - see this is our original picture and uh
07:50 - actually from what i heard
07:51 - um these two women um
07:55 - saw this this picture and we're sharing
07:57 - it on social media and we're excited
07:58 - that they got on the website so i
08:00 - actually don't know who they are
08:02 - uh i just this picture i thought was
08:04 - really great to put on here shows women
08:06 - in stem
08:08 - and
08:09 - they just looked really joyful in the
08:11 - picture so i thought this would be a
08:12 - good picture to use
08:14 - but i'm glad that they like it
08:16 - so
08:18 - anyway
08:20 - let's uh
08:22 - let's get started
08:25 - let me go
08:27 - try to find my timer
08:29 - i'm all
08:31 - let's see
08:36 - okay
08:37 - that's better
08:39 - uh i'm going to start up my server
08:42 - let me make this bigger
08:46 - let's start up our dev server
08:50 - i did a get pool this morning so we're
08:52 - all up to date i've been working a lot
08:54 - from home
08:55 - um so i had a ton of of changes
08:59 - um
09:01 - lately i've been
09:03 - i i it seems like i'm busier now after
09:05 - the site launch than i was before the
09:07 - site launched
09:09 - we ended up finding a lot of of broken
09:11 - links because there were multiple urls
09:13 - for each page
09:15 - that i didn't really know about so that
09:17 - was that was a little bit crazy so i
09:18 - think we found almost all the broken
09:20 - links i mean i'm sure we'll find some
09:22 - more but
09:23 - um
09:24 - i'm trying to get some consistency in
09:26 - only having one url
09:29 - go to one page
09:30 - and not have all this stuff everywhere
09:33 - um
09:34 - okay so we got dev servers running
09:36 - now i'll be able to start up ngrok
09:39 - i'm going to copy and paste the link in
09:41 - the live chat right now
09:43 - and that's going to let you all check
09:45 - out the changes we're making to the
09:46 - website in real time and you'll be able
09:49 - to inspect it and everything
09:51 - right there on your machine
09:55 - so
09:57 - i guess i'll go over here and this is
09:58 - the live site this is at franciscan.edu
10:02 - you could check that out if you want
10:04 - um
10:05 - but i'm gonna go to localhost right now
10:10 - and i'm gonna put this on a different
10:11 - branch let me make this a bit bigger i
10:13 - think that's probably still too small
10:15 - okay
10:16 - so
10:18 - down here in my my terminal
10:21 - and i'm using visual studio code i know
10:23 - usually people ask about this and i just
10:25 - have the the little terminal option down
10:27 - there so if you go to view
10:30 - you can open your terminal
10:32 - right there
10:33 - and i always have two open one to run
10:36 - the
10:37 - uh dev server and the other one for
10:39 - commands usually like git commands
10:43 - but i'm going to go to a different
10:44 - branch right now and
10:47 - if you're not familiar with git uh it's
10:49 - basically like i can test out some
10:51 - things like a separate version of my
10:53 - project without
10:56 - messing up my main version that that i'm
10:58 - gonna push to my live server at some
11:01 - point so this will let us work without
11:04 - having to worry about breaking something
11:06 - because if we do we can always switch
11:08 - back to master branch make a quick
11:10 - change if we need to right so
11:12 - that's that's why i'm going to make this
11:14 - branch so i'm going to do a git checkout
11:17 - with a b flag that b flag is what's
11:19 - going to make the branch check out's
11:20 - actually going to switch us to the
11:22 - branch so we're combining two git
11:24 - commands and then after that i just type
11:26 - the name of the branch so this is going
11:27 - to be
11:28 - let's just call it search
11:31 - hopefully
11:32 - hopefully i don't have a branch called
11:35 - search
11:36 - all right nice i thought i might so we
11:38 - have a new branch called search
11:42 - and
11:43 - now what i'd like to do
11:46 - is i'm going to use a package from
11:48 - algolia called react instant search
11:52 - so
11:54 - i'm just going to copy and paste what
11:56 - they have
11:58 - in their uh instructions and get so
12:00 - that's yarn add react instant search dom
12:04 - and then algolia
12:06 - um
12:07 - algolia search
12:10 - so while that's
12:11 - loading up
12:12 - i'm going to paste i'm going to copy and
12:14 - paste into the live chat the link to
12:16 - this
12:18 - uh repository
12:23 - okay so if you want to check out this
12:25 - this package
12:27 - there's the link right there
12:29 - also let me give you a link to
12:36 - the documentation
12:38 - so you can check that out as well
12:41 - the second link is the documentation
12:44 - and then
12:45 - we'll go i'll show you the algolia
12:48 - dashboard and what's going on over there
12:50 - in just a minute all right so all of
12:52 - this
12:53 - is now loaded
12:56 - and i'm going to try to do just
12:58 - something really basic first to make
12:59 - sure everything works we're definitely
13:01 - i'm going to have to set up some api
13:03 - keys
13:05 - before it will work with the data that i
13:08 - brought in
13:09 - so let's get that running
13:12 - and i need to
13:18 - i'm just going to copy and paste
13:24 - the basic getting started code so you'll
13:27 - see it in a second when i paste it in
13:29 - here
13:30 - and
13:31 - let's see
13:33 - let's just do this on the search page so
13:35 - we already have a search page
13:38 - but what i'd like to do here is
13:42 - i guess add this search in
13:46 - hmm
13:50 - let's get rid of
13:53 - you know let's not get rid of anything
13:55 - for right now let's just add this in
13:58 - and then we know we'll probably end up
13:59 - getting rid of most of this but for now
14:02 - i just want a page where we can
14:04 - view what's happening
14:06 - so right here in this
14:11 - grid where we have our original search
14:14 - whoa and i tried to copy everything in
14:17 - there and that was that was a bad move
14:19 - okay
14:23 - let me do this a better way
14:28 - okay so i'm just gonna copy this
14:30 - component into in here
14:34 - oops and i don't even need this
14:40 - okay so we have this instant search
14:42 - component and we're going to pass in
14:45 - the index name and the search client so
14:47 - i don't have an index called best buy
14:51 - i'm going to have to figure out where my
14:52 - index i do believe i have an index
14:54 - called
14:57 - faculty or something like that uh let's
15:00 - see
15:04 - yeah wp post faculty so let's use that
15:14 - okay
15:15 - so
15:16 - i'm gonna this
15:17 - index um contains all of the data we
15:20 - have on faculty so all of our faculty
15:23 - profiles uh this one's kind of cool
15:25 - because we should also be able to pull
15:28 - images since we have featured images
15:31 - so
15:32 - hopefully we can get that working and
15:34 - then our search results will contain
15:35 - little thumbnail images as well
15:38 - which is kind of it looks kind of cool
15:41 - looks fancy right um now our search
15:44 - client we need to uh pass in some data
15:46 - for that
15:48 - and i'm gonna need to
15:50 - probably put that in a dot end file so i
15:53 - don't
15:54 - put all of my api keys out there let me
15:57 - see what i need
15:59 - i may need
16:01 - search clan index
16:06 - settings components to your app
16:11 - all right um if you're following along
16:15 - let me you know let me bring some of
16:16 - this over so you can see what i'm
16:18 - looking at
16:20 - so
16:22 - here's
16:24 - oops
16:25 - not that
16:26 - or am i looking
16:29 - okay here we go
16:31 - so here's the
16:33 - um
16:35 - documentation
16:37 - and then this is the readme for the
16:40 - github page so i'm right here i've just
16:41 - been copying and pasting some of this
16:43 - over and let me grab this while i'm here
16:45 - and i while i remember
16:48 - we'll just pop this down here
16:51 - okay
16:53 - i'll go with this
16:55 - um and then we need to do
16:58 - we need to bring this in
17:01 - and we can put
17:02 - this i guess wherever let's just put it
17:05 - right here
17:07 - it'll be easier less less scrolling
17:09 - around
17:10 - um so
17:12 - i'm not sure what values need to be here
17:14 - so that's what we need to look up
17:18 - so
17:19 - [Music]
17:20 - let's just check here in the
17:21 - documentation see if we can find it
17:24 - hmm
17:33 - okay it looks like this one is
17:35 - it's a little bit different
17:45 - huh
17:50 - all right let me know if you if you are
17:52 - seeing what i'm seeing here it looks
17:54 - like the instructions are different
17:56 - here and
17:58 - here
18:01 - i wonder let's see when the last time
18:03 - the readme was updated
18:05 - readme was updated a month ago
18:08 - so i'd say that's that's pretty new
18:10 - we're looking at
18:13 - i don't know what version this is
18:18 - okay
18:21 - i'm gonna check the chat too uh just to
18:23 - see if if you all notice something
18:26 - um
18:30 - api
18:32 - id and key
18:36 - okay uh hardship from the live chat is
18:38 - saying the one on github is old is that
18:41 - use the docs okay cool
18:44 - um
18:47 - okay and michael creole was saying the
18:49 - app id is latency the api key and the
18:52 - index name okay cool so actually
18:55 - this shouldn't be a problem for me to
18:56 - put this uh in here because it's not my
18:59 - secret api key right so uh algolia
19:03 - uh can be used client-side
19:06 - so
19:07 - like
19:08 - it it should be fine uh in terms of
19:13 - your your api will be fine right
19:15 - nobody's going to get access
19:16 - to be able to change anything on your
19:18 - api they maybe could pull data from your
19:21 - api which in my opinion is fine right
19:23 - because this is all information we want
19:26 - the public to have so
19:28 - uh why not give it to them
19:30 - all right so let's do that let me go to
19:34 - on my other screen i am going to go to
19:37 - my dashboard just to grab my api keys
19:40 - actually
19:41 - yeah let me show you the dashboard
19:43 - because the uh
19:46 - the secret api key is
19:51 - um is hidden right so nobody can see
19:53 - that anyway so i'm okay with that
19:55 - so this is the algolia dashboard we've
19:57 - gone to api keys and this is our
20:01 - application id i'm going to copy that
20:03 - and let's put it
20:04 - uh actually let's let's go with what the
20:07 - doc said
20:08 - um
20:12 - actually the docs don't even have me
20:14 - using
20:16 - algolia
20:18 - search
20:20 - so maybe i don't need that
20:22 - all right so let's let's go with what
20:24 - they say here
20:26 - let's get rid of this
20:29 - and get rid of this
20:34 - and scroll down
20:40 - there we go
20:41 - okay so we're not gonna have search
20:44 - client
20:45 - i'm gonna paste this we already have
20:47 - index name so let's get rid of that
20:49 - now we can throw in our app id
20:52 - oops
20:54 - our app id
21:00 - and our api key
21:07 - okay
21:09 - let's save that
21:10 - and
21:14 - let's see oh harshit says uh it's
21:17 - feeling too sleepy today see you
21:19 - horseshit i know it's really late where
21:20 - you're at thank you so much for uh for
21:22 - joining us and for helping out
21:26 - okay
21:27 - so hopefully
21:29 - everything else is okay i know i kind of
21:31 - switched instructions there in the
21:33 - middle we could probably get rid of
21:37 - i'm not gonna do it right now we can
21:39 - clean it up later but we may not need
21:41 - that algolia search package that i
21:43 - loaded so
21:44 - maybe i'll get rid of that
21:46 - in a little bit but first let's just see
21:48 - if if this is working
21:50 - uh let's see
21:54 - all right so it says use widgets here
21:56 - which it looks like we've already put in
21:59 - yeah we put in a search box and it hits
22:01 - so let's see if anything shows up
22:03 - uh you all may already know you may be
22:06 - going to that page already
22:07 - so i'm gonna go to search and see
22:11 - hmm
22:13 - nothing showing up here
22:18 - yes so
22:20 - it looks like
22:24 - nothing is rendering let me
22:28 - i want to inspect this
22:30 - and just see if anything is there
22:32 - see what's going on
22:35 - inspect
22:37 - oh it's popping up on my other screen
22:41 - let's see
22:42 - so it should be
22:49 - hmm
22:57 - yeah that's weird
23:00 - all right let's
23:03 - insert search box it's
23:18 - all right let's go back to the
23:21 - uh
23:22 - documentation
23:24 - i feel like i can't talk today i keep
23:26 - like searching for the words
23:29 - i'm pretty tired
23:30 - i was up before 5 a.m today
23:33 - it was actually exciting so there's a
23:37 - conference in russia a javascript
23:40 - conference called
23:42 - uh holy js
23:44 - and it's
23:46 - held i think twice a year once in moscow
23:49 - and once i can't remember the other
23:50 - location uh but i got uh i guess kind of
23:54 - interviewed to be a speaker at the one
23:56 - in moscow at the end of november so
23:59 - i had to do the interview at a time that
24:01 - was convenient in moscow time
24:04 - so it was 1 p.m in moscow when i did the
24:07 - interview but it was 6 00 am where i'm
24:10 - at so i wanted to make sure i got up
24:11 - early and was prepared
24:13 - so i may be speaking about how we built
24:16 - this app at a conference in russia in
24:20 - november i really hope i get to go uh
24:22 - because i've never been out of the
24:24 - country
24:25 - um oh i am gonna go to germany though
24:27 - for the um
24:28 - for uh the doc fest uh conference so
24:32 - that'll be cool
24:34 - so i may go from being 30 i'll be 33 in
24:38 - october so i'll go from being 33 years
24:40 - old never leave in the country to go
24:42 - into two foreign countries in november
24:44 - maybe
24:45 - that'll be fun
24:47 - all right let's see what our
24:49 - widgets are
24:52 - okay so search box
24:54 - that's good we did that right
24:56 - search box
24:58 - okay
25:00 - and then
25:02 - all right let's see about styling the
25:03 - widgets maybe
25:11 - i don't
25:12 - i mean it just it seems like
25:14 - i should see something without the
25:16 - styling right anything
25:21 - hmm
25:22 - maybe i'll i'm going to get rid of hits
25:24 - because i don't really know what that
25:25 - does right now and i'd rather keep it
25:27 - simple just
25:29 - you know if we're just trying to make
25:30 - this work so let's get rid of that
25:32 - and let's also get rid of
25:36 - see i don't want to try to i don't want
25:38 - to get rid of too much and then have
25:42 - let's just move this somewhere
25:44 - uh my fear is that i start removing this
25:46 - stuff and then it causes errors and then
25:48 - i have to try to go back and see
25:51 - it we're going to take up half the
25:52 - stream just removing things
25:54 - so uh let's see
25:58 - let's just throw something in here
26:02 - put a little further down the page maybe
26:04 - we'll have better luck if it's showing
26:05 - up
26:09 - yay look we got something
26:12 - so right here we have a search whoops i
26:14 - accidentally clicked on a link
26:17 - okay so we have a search here
26:23 - uh let's see what happens um
26:28 - uh let's see if we can find some
26:32 - uh education faculty members
26:36 - search
26:42 - okay
26:43 - nothing happened
26:45 - i'm gonna check the console i have it
26:47 - open another screen
26:49 - and it looks like
26:54 - we're getting an error
27:03 - hmm
27:09 - all right let me show you the air we're
27:10 - getting
27:23 - okay
27:31 - oh it's not here let me make this bigger
27:34 - okay
27:36 - okay so
27:37 - it failed
27:41 - failed loading post
27:49 - so it looks like it was trying to get
27:51 - something
27:52 - and failed
27:56 - and
28:00 - we got some errors here which
28:06 - tell you truth i'm not 100 sure this is
28:09 - just from algolia i
28:11 - i suspect it is but i'm trying to see
28:17 - i don't see anything that says
28:21 - for sure that it's coming from there
28:23 - so
28:26 - i guess we'll try
28:31 - um
28:36 - so it's trying to make a call
28:45 - let's see what's happening here's all
28:47 - our algolia queries and we can see let's
28:50 - let's make this large so we can kind of
28:52 - see what's happening
28:53 - um
28:55 - here's the results that we get
28:58 - um from the index post faculty
29:02 - and it looks like
29:04 - yeah we're getting we're getting data
29:07 - right so we we have here um
29:10 - dr alex plato i just saw him earlier
29:13 - today he's a good guy
29:15 - um
29:16 - he's also a philosophy professor and he
29:19 - has the best name for a philosophy
29:21 - professor
29:22 - okay so we we actually did get the data
29:24 - i'm just not exactly sure
29:26 - why
29:29 - what happened here okay so we got the
29:31 - data it's just not displayed
29:34 - let's look at our console again so it
29:36 - failed
29:42 - no that's not it
29:47 - there we go okay so
29:50 - it looks like it failed
29:51 - up here but it actually worked down here
29:55 - so maybe let's just get rid of
29:56 - everything uh restart it and then see
29:59 - what's happening if i can find
30:03 - here we are okay
30:05 - um let's just try it again we'll hit
30:08 - search again
30:14 - um let me refresh and then we'll do a
30:17 - search
30:22 - all right actually let me check first
30:25 - okay
30:26 - looks like we're getting whatever errors
30:27 - we just got before may not even be due
30:30 - to algolia
30:32 - let's go
30:34 - i'm gonna search again and see what
30:36 - happens
30:39 - interesting okay so
30:41 - it seems like we fail first
30:44 - and then it works
30:49 - um but in any case nothing is actually
30:52 - being displayed so let's go back to our
30:55 - documentation
30:57 - in about three minutes i'm going to go
30:58 - back and answer some things in the live
31:00 - chat
31:02 - harshit says you need hits component to
31:04 - display data
31:07 - thanks harshit i guess
31:09 - that component i just deleted was more
31:11 - important than i thought so let's throw
31:13 - that back in there we'll put it down
31:15 - under the search box
31:20 - the hits component and we'll go up here
31:22 - and make sure we import hits component
31:29 - hardship i thought you're going to sleep
31:30 - but you came back to save the day
31:33 - thank you
31:36 - okay oops let's
31:38 - hey look at this we we have it it looks
31:41 - not great but we have it
31:45 - cool so the data's here
31:46 - um
31:49 - look it's a live search so i just type
31:51 - biology let me zoom in this is
31:54 - so i just typed in biology and we get
31:56 - the the data uh let's type in i don't
32:00 - know see if we have anybody named joe no
32:02 - no jojo's
32:04 - there we go we do have some josephs
32:06 - though that that works
32:08 - um
32:11 - cool
32:12 - all right
32:16 - so
32:17 - next step then
32:19 - we need to make this look good we it's
32:21 - working obviously
32:23 - uh so that's important right it it's
32:25 - it's on the site we're getting the data
32:27 - it works here's the next steps because
32:29 - the timer's about to go off so i'm going
32:30 - to do these next steps just
32:33 - so we know where to pick off
32:34 - all right um
32:36 - not only do we need to make it look good
32:38 - which is definitely important but we've
32:39 - only searched for faculty right i have a
32:41 - lot of other things i want to search for
32:43 - so right now every post type is an
32:45 - individual index in algolia
32:48 - so we need to figure out how do you
32:50 - search multiple indices
32:54 - with algolia uh michael says that's fast
32:56 - yeah it's insanely fast it's so much
32:58 - faster than what we built so it's
33:00 - definitely it's better in many ways
33:03 - um
33:06 - so
33:06 - we need to probably the first thing we
33:08 - should do is make sure we have all the
33:10 - data in order so let's figure out how to
33:11 - search multiple indices then once we see
33:14 - what all the data is going to be like
33:16 - then we can figure out how we're going
33:17 - to display it first thing we'll do
33:20 - though is uh
33:22 - before we try to make our own solution
33:23 - we'll see what solution comes
33:25 - prepackaged with algolia i think that
33:27 - styling section that i skipped over is
33:29 - probably going to come in handy here
33:31 - so that's what we'll look for if we like
33:33 - how algolia styles it then maybe we'll
33:36 - do it
33:37 - like that hopefully maybe it'll work
33:40 - right off the bat maybe some minimal
33:42 - styling changes and then we can have
33:43 - this thing live
33:45 - like before i leave today which would be
33:47 - awesome
33:48 - okay
33:51 - short break i'm gonna go to the live
33:52 - chat i'm scrolling all the way up to the
33:54 - top i'm gonna answer as many questions
33:55 - as i can
33:57 - uh let's see
33:58 - just a lot of people saying hello so i'm
34:00 - not gonna read out all the individual
34:02 - hellos but i am reading them so i know
34:04 - that you said hi and i'm saying hi back
34:07 - uh
34:07 - [Music]
34:08 - mauro says uh
34:11 - if possible use test driven development
34:14 - i know i know i i need to be better with
34:17 - using tests and
34:19 - um
34:21 - i'm just always busy and i don't make it
34:22 - a priority realistically i mean that's
34:24 - that's the truth if if i made it a
34:26 - priority i would probably do it
34:28 - um
34:29 - but it's so tempting to just
34:32 - you know get code written without
34:34 - worrying about tests uh so i need to do
34:36 - a better job at that and um feel free to
34:39 - call me out on that if you all see me
34:40 - doing it too
34:42 - uh maybe i ought to take a course on um
34:45 - tests
34:46 - writing tests uh and
34:48 - part of the reason why i don't do it is
34:50 - because i just don't feel confident in
34:51 - my skills at it
34:53 - so
34:54 - that might be
34:55 - a good idea
34:57 - um
35:00 - karma says you're doing an amazing job
35:03 - don't listen to the negative feedback
35:05 - thank you i appreciate that i appreciate
35:07 - it i mean i
35:09 - sometimes there's some truth in the
35:11 - negative feedback so i'm just i'm trying
35:12 - to
35:14 - i'm trying to read it hear it you know
35:16 - and and see like what what is the truth
35:18 - to it
35:19 - um so like some of the feedback about
35:22 - not actually showing any
35:24 - not giving any indication that this is a
35:26 - catholic university
35:28 - you know the way that people were saying
35:30 - it was kind of mean but the truth was
35:32 - yeah actually i mean the previous
35:34 - website it was really obvious in this
35:36 - website it wasn't so
35:39 - the truth was hey maybe i wouldn't
35:41 - include some type of image that would
35:43 - show that so i mean it
35:46 - it's true but it you know when you get
35:48 - so much of that uh it does just kind of
35:50 - wear you down like even if i'm trying to
35:52 - to ignore it you know it still gets
35:55 - it's in there you know it's in your
35:56 - brain
35:59 - lorehan says
36:01 - uh
36:02 - uh a word i can't say uh to the haters
36:06 - no worries you're doing a majestic job
36:08 - oh i love that i'm a majestic job thank
36:10 - you i appreciate that
36:14 - morrow says algolia uses elasticsearch
36:16 - in the background it just makes it easy
36:18 - to implement oh awesome that's really
36:20 - cool i did not realize that
36:23 - um
36:24 - euro says you're looking bad don't take
36:27 - it so close to your heart oh well thank
36:29 - you i i appreciate the sentiment
36:34 - that stinks that i'm looking bad but
36:36 - like realistically my my eyes were
36:38 - probably red like i'm i was up super
36:41 - early
36:44 - uh
36:45 - let's see
36:49 - morrow says algolia is better for just
36:51 - front end devs if you're a full stack
36:53 - you can use elasticsearch so you have
36:54 - more control over the search okay good
36:56 - to know
36:58 - good to know like i said maybe i'll
36:59 - check it out at some point and
37:02 - use it on a future project or work it
37:04 - into this project
37:06 - seems like something maybe i'd i'd need
37:07 - to research a little bit more to get
37:09 - right though
37:10 - uh tripp says do you enjoy your job uh
37:13 - not are you happy with it but do you
37:14 - enjoy it i i really i do enjoy my job i
37:18 - mean there are always parts of a job
37:19 - that you don't enjoy so um uh
37:23 - sometimes like the the attitude of
37:25 - people that i work with not necessarily
37:27 - in my own department but like
37:28 - in the the larger organization
37:31 - um is frustrating
37:33 - um
37:34 - so
37:35 - i don't necessarily enjoy that part of
37:38 - my job
37:39 - uh but i do enjoy what i do i enjoy
37:42 - building um
37:44 - websites apps uh
37:47 - making them look nice making them fast
37:50 - and
37:50 - through that helping people to
37:53 - get information or do their jobs you
37:56 - know better uh than they did before i
37:58 - mean i think that's really cool um
38:00 - that's
38:01 - that's pretty awesome so i definitely
38:04 - enjoy that
38:07 - trip says as much as you did when you
38:08 - started coding honestly i think i enjoy
38:11 - what i do now more than i did when i
38:12 - started because i'm better at it now
38:17 - before there was just so much
38:19 - i had to think about everything
38:21 - everything was hard
38:22 - right there was so much that i didn't
38:24 - know and uh so much that i was like i
38:27 - don't know if i can do that
38:29 - now
38:30 - uh i know i'm more confident in the
38:33 - things that i know and i'm okay with the
38:35 - things that i don't know right i realize
38:38 - that i can't be an expert at everything
38:40 - so i've just been able to let go
38:43 - and not worry that i'm not an expert at
38:45 - everything and just say you know what
38:47 - like i'm i'm gonna do what i know how to
38:49 - do i'm gonna try to learn as much as i
38:51 - can but at the end of the day like i'm
38:53 - gonna try to produce something awesome
38:55 - you know no matter what technology end
38:57 - up using or whatever like
38:59 - um
39:00 - so i i like that
39:02 - uh
39:04 - i don't know i think it can be like that
39:06 - with everything when you first start
39:07 - something it's it's fun because it's new
39:10 - right
39:10 - but then you get into this area where
39:12 - like
39:14 - you start to realize um
39:17 - how
39:18 - bad you are at it because you're new
39:21 - and then it's not as fun because you see
39:22 - other people doing awesome stuff and you
39:24 - can't do that yet
39:26 - so
39:27 - once you get past that and i i think i'm
39:30 - i'm past that to a certain extent right
39:32 - there's still a ton of cool stuff i want
39:34 - to be able to do but i can't yet uh but
39:36 - i can do a lot so
39:38 - now it's it's fun you know i know okay
39:41 - if somebody asked me to do this thing
39:43 - i know i got this right now it's not a
39:46 - matter of can i do it it's
39:48 - well like how am i gonna do it how fast
39:50 - can i make it how nice can i make it
39:52 - look um
39:54 - what new tech can i use and learn while
39:57 - i'm doing this
39:58 - and that's just
40:00 - that's fun it's fun for me
40:02 - um
40:03 - and the added thing of being able to see
40:05 - you all in the live stream is just like
40:07 - this whole another level of just
40:09 - coolness to the
40:10 - to what i do that uh was is just
40:13 - unexpected and really amazing so
40:17 - um that's a really good question that
40:18 - made me think but i i i like that i like
40:21 - that question okay
40:23 - definitely didn't get through all the
40:24 - questions
40:25 - i'm gonna start up my pomodoro timer
40:27 - again
40:28 - and let's see
40:31 - cool hershey just
40:34 - gave me the algolia css awesome
40:39 - so
40:41 - let's go over and throw this css
40:44 - in our head
40:46 - there we go so we have our layout here
40:48 - and
40:49 - let's grab
40:51 - harsha put in that css but i want to
40:53 - just
40:54 - you know what i'm i'm just
40:56 - don't feel like actually typing out a
40:58 - link tag so
40:59 - i'm going to grab this
41:01 - uh let's see i think this is what
41:03 - horseshit does instances
41:07 - themes
41:09 - oh maybe this is different
41:18 - actually this is different
41:20 - i wonder
41:27 - i'm going to grab these because they're
41:29 - already there
41:31 - reset
41:32 - this
41:37 - all right
41:38 - we'll try the reset one first what is
41:40 - the difference
41:44 - okay
41:45 - all right let's they recommend using the
41:47 - reset so let me grab this one
41:52 - and
41:54 - we'll paste this in so we have this
41:56 - little
41:57 - head component
41:59 - and that lets us throw in things like
42:01 - link tags right so we already have this
42:03 - link tag of our
42:05 - page.css
42:09 - and
42:11 - which page.css gets used on
42:15 - almost everything so
42:18 - might not be a bad idea to just make
42:19 - that global
42:21 - i'd have to make sure
42:24 - okay let's see what
42:25 - we have now
42:30 - hmm
42:33 - okay
42:34 - looks like
42:36 - maybe didn't do anything
42:44 - where's my
42:48 - css
42:50 - okay that came in why did not do
42:52 - anything
42:55 - reset is basic algolia is more stylish
42:58 - okay
43:01 - so
43:02 - let's go with
43:04 - the more stylish one
43:12 - okay let's go back here and see
43:19 - let's see what the algolia one
43:24 - is where's my
43:34 - whoops
43:37 - gotta close that tag
43:45 - whoops keep going the wrong way
43:47 - okay all right oh yeah that's definitely
43:51 - uh different here
43:53 - okay cool so now we're getting this
43:54 - still like we're getting
43:56 - a lot of um
44:00 - a lot of this so we probably need to say
44:02 - to indicate somehow exactly what data we
44:04 - want to display because a lot of this is
44:06 - is completely irrelevant
44:10 - but this is pretty cool i mean this is
44:12 - not it's not exactly
44:14 - the style that we use for the for the
44:17 - website so
44:20 - i would be okay with adding it like in
44:22 - here
44:23 - with this type of styling temporarily
44:26 - just to get a good search in there
44:28 - because the functionality is important
44:30 - uh to get in there right away but
44:33 - and then maybe going back and redoing it
44:35 - so that it matches our material design
44:37 - style
44:38 - but this is good enough i think it could
44:41 - work
44:41 - uh definitely need to figure out
44:44 - oh you know what i just said at the last
44:46 - end of the last pomodoro session that we
44:48 - were gonna get all our data before we
44:50 - started styling
44:51 - and i completely forgot
44:54 - okay
44:56 - well we reversed
44:58 - reverse that
45:02 - and
45:06 - let's see
45:12 - sorry my boss just sent me a question
45:14 - um
45:28 - okay
45:31 - so up to this point it's been mostly me
45:33 - entering data and some student workers
45:35 - and i haven't gone through the process
45:37 - yet of uh really teaching anybody else
45:40 - how to enter data so it's a little bit
45:42 - crazy for me because every time some of
45:44 - these change like i get these questions
45:46 - so
45:47 - um
45:49 - all right let's check our documentation
45:52 - and figure out how to get
45:54 - uh search multiple
45:56 - uh indices right is that how you do it
45:58 - and it's not indexes right it's indices
46:02 - i don't know
46:03 - i think it's indices
46:05 - okay
46:07 - let's see if it says it
46:16 - um
46:17 - parameters
46:29 - hmm
46:37 - okay charbel says
46:39 - sometimes it is indexes all right let's
46:41 - go to the dashboard and see what it says
46:44 - all right algolia
46:47 - uses the term indices so i guess we'll
46:49 - just use indices for now
46:52 - and
46:53 - [Music]
46:54 - all right
47:00 - there we go multi-index why didn't i see
47:02 - that
47:07 - there we go
47:09 - you can use multiple index components
47:13 - each index component takes one prop
47:21 - okay
47:39 - all right
47:40 - let's check out both examples so it
47:42 - looks like there's there's two different
47:44 - ways to do it
47:47 - um
47:50 - not that one uh let's go to source and
47:54 - check out app okay
47:57 - so
47:59 - they have instant search and they have
48:00 - one index there and then
48:06 - underneath hits they use index
48:10 - oh and then
48:12 - results in the second database
48:14 - all right let's just copy and paste this
48:16 - and see how it looks
48:17 - see if this is what
48:20 - kind of what we're going for
48:23 - let's
48:24 - import index first
48:32 - and then we'll use it down here
48:34 - whoops down here
48:37 - so under hits
49:06 - um
49:07 - sorry i did my boss messaged me again
49:11 - so
49:12 - let's put in a real index name
49:17 - let's go to our dashboard and see
49:22 - um faculty
49:29 - i thought i had more than this
49:33 - oh well
49:42 - um could go with
49:50 - campus security because i i think that's
49:52 - all those those all have the data that
49:54 - they need so we'll go with that
49:57 - so
50:04 - jesus
50:12 - is that what it was
50:18 - oh it's hyphenated
50:20 - there we go
50:26 - okay
50:53 - all right
50:58 - oh okay
50:59 - all right so this will put them they'll
51:01 - be displayed but they'll just be
51:03 - displayed
51:06 - below
51:10 - interesting
51:24 - okay
51:31 - all right let's see
51:33 - we need
51:37 - i'm just not sure about that i mean i
51:47 - i just don't know about it
51:49 - it works but i'm not
51:51 - i'm not sure that that's the best thing
51:59 - hmm
52:07 - let's look at the other option
52:10 - so what is this react instant search
52:15 - multi-index
52:52 - it seems a lot more complicated but
52:54 - maybe it'll give us what we want
52:57 - um
53:01 - mad touch this says my phone is tripping
53:03 - i'll catch you later see ya thanks for
53:06 - watching
53:07 - all right um
53:11 - i'm just telling you 12 minutes okay
53:12 - let's try to get this other
53:14 - example working
53:35 - let's see
53:37 - we may need to put this
53:43 - yeah you know what let's just grab this
53:45 - whole component let's make a new
53:47 - component
53:51 - and we'll we'll do this or
53:55 - how about this
53:56 - let's just get rid of this entire search
53:58 - page
53:59 - and pop this in here
54:01 - and call it search
54:10 - no
54:23 - okay
54:24 - and
54:26 - react auto suggest
54:28 - i guess i have to do this um
54:31 - yarn and
54:37 - all right so we're getting react auto
54:39 - suggest
54:41 - and
54:44 - uh api keys i got to put my api key in
54:47 - again
54:54 - it's so convenient when they have that
54:56 - little button that copies automatically
55:01 - i mean it seems like something like i
55:03 - don't need this you know but really
55:06 - it's so helpful
55:10 - and
55:11 - what did we have uh
55:13 - wpp
55:15 - post
55:18 - faculty
55:21 - and then
55:29 - campus
55:32 - and let's go with
55:40 - news
55:44 - cool let's see
55:47 - carousel react instant search connectors
55:54 - hmm
56:03 - uh let's check out the package json from
56:07 - this example
56:11 - make sure we have everything
56:16 - react on react instant search i'll just
56:18 - suggest
56:21 - uh
56:22 - looks
56:23 - like we have all the packages
56:52 - michael was shocked that i just deleted
56:54 - everything
57:01 - all right why is this not working
57:14 - what the heck
57:22 - it should be
57:23 - react instant surge connectors
57:44 - all right let's go back to the
57:45 - documentation
57:49 - maybe
57:52 - you need to use the autocomplete
57:53 - connectors
57:56 - all right so let's see what it says
57:58 - about this
58:24 - let's see
58:32 - all right let's
58:35 - copy and paste this
58:39 - and just search for it and see
58:42 - what comes up
58:51 - okay
58:57 - when you want to display a widget using
58:59 - another library like material ui hey
59:01 - cool i do want to
59:02 - um
59:06 - what are connectors how to use them
59:30 - hmm
59:40 - okay
59:59 - when i
60:09 - when i first installed this
60:11 - i installed react instant search
60:15 - dom
60:18 - and not react instant search right
60:24 - let's check our package json
60:33 - yep
60:35 - okay
60:36 - here's we need to do let's go
60:39 - yarn
60:40 - i don't know what the command is let's
60:41 - try to remove
60:50 - let's double check and make sure i don't
60:51 - need this
60:53 - thumb thing
60:57 - okay
61:01 - cool we removed it
61:02 - all right
61:05 - also while we're at it let's remove
61:08 - algolia search
61:12 - you're
61:17 - going
61:17 - to go your search
61:25 - then uh we can install
61:29 - yarn
61:31 - or we could we could do yarn
61:33 - what is it called
61:35 - instant react instant search
61:44 - all right so as horseshit mentioned
61:46 - earlier the
61:47 - for whatever reason the instructions in
61:50 - the readme were out of date so
61:53 - we started with those instructions and
61:55 - then we moved over to the other ones
61:57 - which were newer
61:58 - unfortunately it was actually different
62:01 - packages so
62:03 - hopefully now
62:05 - things will work
62:09 - so let's go back and see
62:13 - yay
62:14 - all right look how beautiful this page
62:16 - is
62:17 - all right let's
62:19 - let's see um
62:22 - we want to say
62:27 - see if we have
62:28 - computer
62:32 - computer science
62:35 - nothing
62:37 - what is happening
62:46 - we expect i can't see anything why is
62:48 - this
62:50 - this box
62:52 - all right yeah
62:54 - what is going on
62:56 - can't read property trump undefined
62:58 - all right looks like some weirdness is
63:00 - happening
63:04 - finish loading posts here
63:11 - all right we're getting stuff right
63:13 - let's see who we got from here
63:17 - there we got these queries
63:20 - results
63:22 - faculty yeah yeah we got
63:25 - who is this
63:28 - yeah dr christina safranski she's a very
63:31 - nice woman
63:32 - talked to her last week
63:34 - um
63:36 - all right so for whatever reason we're
63:38 - having some issues getting this
63:40 - rendered
63:42 - but
63:45 - it looks like it works though
63:48 - it's just
63:50 - um
63:54 - it's not
63:58 - so we're getting the data
64:01 - that works that's important
64:04 - let's see where i've gone wrong
64:07 - hey maybe i'll look at the error message
64:09 - that
64:10 - that seems like a good idea
64:15 - okay
64:18 - uncle type can i read property trimble
64:19 - undefined auto suggest js41
64:31 - it's just 77.
64:38 - all right let's check this out 77 ought
64:41 - to suggest okay you know what probably
64:43 - one of these props i passed in is not
64:45 - working right with the data that we
64:47 - actually have
64:49 - all right so
64:51 - those look good
65:05 - all right so see what these are doing
65:08 - it's value
65:10 - stage search for product placeholder
65:13 - section hit section index
65:29 - all right my timer went off let's do
65:31 - another break
65:34 - and
65:36 - i'm gonna scroll up and try to figure
65:38 - out where i left off so we can answer
65:40 - more questions
65:42 - and
65:44 - probably do another pomodoro session
65:46 - after this figure out what's going on
65:48 - just it feels like we're close you know
65:52 - just have to sort out what's going on
65:53 - there with all those props
65:55 - uh
65:56 - might not be a bad idea to just go to
65:58 - the um
66:00 - uh documentation and figure out what
66:03 - those props actually do
66:15 - uh massoud says i want to learn computer
66:17 - software coding system uh awesome

67:32 - probably really early on before i said i
67:33 - was gonna use it
67:35 - uh
67:35 - let's see
67:45 - phoenix says today i successfully
67:47 - created my blog site using gatsby it was
67:50 - previously plain html and javascript
67:52 - it's a great tool made a few uh mistakes

67:58 - learned oh that's awesome
67:59 - congratulations
68:02 - uh
68:03 - how many says uh amazing progress on the
68:06 - website since last time i saw a great

68:44 - awesome well i'm glad that you are able
68:46 - to watch live it's good to see you
68:49 - john says i guess i missed a bunch
68:53 - at the point you came in not too much i
68:55 - guess
69:02 - carlos says jesse maybe you can come to
69:04 - switzerland would be great that would be
69:06 - so awesome
69:07 - so
69:08 - all right so anybody that
69:10 - uh may at some point ever want to like
69:12 - hang out with me or get a cup of coffee
69:14 - or whatever
69:15 - um
69:16 - if you're ever near pittsburgh
69:18 - let me know because i'm not that far
69:21 - from pittsburgh and i would drive up
69:22 - there and hang out
69:24 - but
69:24 - if there's a tech conference near you
69:28 - let me know
69:29 - like in enough time that i can
69:32 - try to apply to speak there
69:35 - and then i'll go or
69:36 - if it's in the united states
69:39 - my employer would may pay for me to go
69:41 - so that would also be okay if it's
69:43 - outside the united states i doubt
69:45 - they'll pay for me but if i be if i was
69:47 - a speaker the conference would probably
69:48 - pay for me to go and then i'd be more
69:51 - than happy to come hang out uh so i try
69:53 - to stay up to date on the conferences
69:55 - but
69:56 - there's so many of them it's just it's
69:57 - hard to keep track of all of them and
70:00 - i really like going to conferences and
70:02 - meeting people and speaking
70:06 - let's see
70:20 - let's see john says nice opportunity
70:23 - think of me on your travels since you
70:24 - share your birthday with me
70:28 - oh really
70:30 - we share a birthday
70:32 - no way so my birthday is october 29th
70:35 - so uh if anybody has lots of money
70:37 - laying around and wants to buy me
70:38 - something i'll send you a link to my
70:40 - amazon wishlist and no i'm just
70:43 - i'm just messing around
70:45 - uh
70:47 - but um
70:48 - if you want to wish me happy birthday
70:50 - that'd be cool
70:52 - let's see
70:54 - i mean you don't have to right now but
70:56 - like
70:57 - in october
71:03 - turbo asked if i've ever been to an
71:04 - o'reilly conference i have not but i'm
71:06 - really interested in it they seem like
71:08 - huge like cool conferences so um
71:12 - definitely would be be interested in
71:14 - going
71:15 - they aren't they they're
71:17 - they're kind of expensive
71:20 - i can't i don't want to say for sure but
71:22 - i like vaguely remember
71:23 - that those conferences were a little bit
71:25 - more expensive than
71:27 - the conferences i usually go to
71:33 - okay
71:36 - my timer went off again so
71:43 - i'm gonna
71:45 - i'm just kind of scanning through to see
71:48 - where the next question is so i can
71:49 - start there next time
71:55 - okay
71:56 - 235
71:58 - i'm gonna write down this question
72:03 - or that time stamp
72:05 - oh my goodness
72:07 - i just looked at my phone i don't think
72:09 - i've ever had this many
72:12 - notifications let me see
72:15 - i wonder if y'all can see that
72:19 - like that's all the notifications across
72:21 - the bottom there
72:23 - i so many all right
72:28 - i don't know what's happening
72:32 - it's lots of news stories and youtube
72:34 - notifications
72:39 - all right
72:41 - we're gonna do one more pomodoro session
72:42 - try to get this working if i can't get
72:44 - it in one more session then
72:47 - i'll just read the rest of the questions
72:49 - and we'll end it and i'll work on it
72:51 - later on hopefully and
72:53 - um
72:55 - i got until
72:56 - five
72:57 - so at five the university's having this
72:59 - this like um oktoberfest thing so we
73:02 - have a campus in austria in gaming and
73:05 - uh so they call it garming fest but it's
73:07 - basically like an oktoberfest thing and
73:10 - that's at five and my kids are coming my
73:12 - wife's coming so i gotta finish by then
73:19 - oops my boss just sent me this to show
73:22 - me that
73:23 - the title
73:25 - hmm
73:41 - okay so that is actually a big deal i
73:43 - don't know if you can see because it's
73:44 - small but there's no title tag on these
73:47 - pages
73:49 - so that's important for search engine
73:50 - optimization also
73:52 - there's no
73:53 - indicator that of what this page
73:56 - actually is
73:57 - so the url you can see it's the theology
73:59 - faculty
74:00 - but it'd be cool to have a title on the
74:02 - page which is already on my list anyway
74:04 - but it's
74:06 - it's gonna move higher up on my list now
74:07 - that my boss said to do it
74:11 - so
74:11 - i just told my boss that i'm gonna
74:13 - finish the search thing first and then i
74:15 - will move on to that
74:16 - um so
74:20 - i think that that will be good
74:22 - uh let's see
74:28 - where do we leave off
74:32 - oh the props so we're getting an error
74:36 - about
74:40 - okay so the error happened let's see if
74:42 - we can get
74:44 - a better
74:47 - filter render under suggestions
74:52 - all right just kind of wanted to check
74:54 - out that error message see if we can get
74:55 - a hint of exactly where it was
74:58 - render suggestion
75:00 - it looks like it's the suggestions part
75:03 - tag name
75:06 - um
75:09 - all right so let's read about this
75:11 - render suggestion prop first and see if
75:13 - we can figure it out
75:16 - um where are we at
75:18 - autocomplete
75:26 - that's the autocomplete component right
75:29 - yeah let's see if we can find that then
75:46 - so
76:00 - let's see
76:09 - did anything come up when i search for
76:11 - that
76:16 - connect autocomplete let's see there
76:25 - that does not look like what i'm looking
76:27 - for
76:45 - all right let's see what this does
77:07 - hmm
77:10 - i just want
77:19 - i just want to know what these props do
77:22 - right it's not
77:34 - hmm
77:35 - i actually named
77:44 - all right so it seems like
77:47 - let me read this error message again
77:53 - so it's trying to trim a property that
77:56 - is undefined i'm assuming then that
78:01 - it's that hit
78:03 - property that's undefined so we're
78:05 - passing in
78:06 - a string of name and a string of marks
78:09 - so that should be fine it should be
78:10 - defined the only thing that potentially
78:12 - could be undefined is hit
78:14 - so
78:15 - we're passing in
78:17 - render
78:20 - is it render suggestion
78:23 - oh that's just render suggestion period
78:29 - get suggestions oh you know we need to
78:31 - go
78:36 - up to
78:38 - suggestions fetch my suggestions clearly
78:41 - requested
78:43 - justin's value
78:48 - let's figure out where all this stuff is
78:50 - getting
78:51 - passed around
79:01 - okay so that's supposed to return
79:04 - hit name
79:06 - maybe
79:08 - maybe name isn't a value
79:14 - so i mean hit should work right
79:17 - but if it's trying to get name
79:19 - let's let's see our data
79:22 - let's go back to our network and see
79:24 - what we're getting so
79:26 - a result
79:28 - and we have hits right so
79:30 - each hit
79:32 - is going to be
79:35 - here so we have hits and we have name
79:38 - we don't right
79:48 - no we don't have name so what do we want
79:50 - to use
79:53 - so this is supposed to be
79:55 - git suggestion value
79:58 - now we don't really want name we want
80:01 - i'm assuming that name would be what's
80:03 - actually displayed
80:05 - so let's see
80:07 - i guess we want title post title so a1
80:11 - is
80:12 - for this particular hit
80:18 - it's just going to go ahead it's in a
80:20 - particular head let's see if we can just
80:22 - do a hit dot
80:24 - uh post title and see if that'll work
80:36 - okay
80:43 - just kind of scanning through to see if
80:45 - there's anything else that
80:47 - we might need to change
80:54 - okay and there should be a title
80:58 - what did i call that post yeah there
81:00 - should be a post title for every piece
81:02 - of data that we pull in since we're
81:03 - dealing with with all posts
81:07 - uh
81:08 - i'm gonna refresh this
81:10 - and
81:12 - let's go back to the console see what
81:13 - we're getting
81:14 - window id okay that's fine
81:17 - um
81:19 - so we're gonna go
81:26 - see we're getting
81:28 - okay uh we're not getting that error
81:30 - anymore
81:32 - that's good uh we're still not
81:35 - displaying anything
81:42 - we're not displaying anything so let's
81:47 - let's inspect just to see if if it's
81:49 - just um
81:54 - yeah nothing's coming up
82:02 - ah
82:04 - that says post underscore title oh is
82:06 - that it was it did i put the wrong thing
82:08 - in
82:11 - uh good
82:13 - good catch on that
82:15 - let's double check that it's
82:19 - it is post underscore title awesome
82:22 - i'm so glad you saw that who was that uh
82:25 - swag swaga caught the post underscore
82:28 - title
82:29 - and
82:31 - that's probably our issue
82:33 - i'm really glad you caught that because
82:34 - it may have taken me forever to figure
82:36 - it out
82:40 - all right let's see if we get something
82:42 - now
82:44 - no
82:46 - let me refresh manually just double
82:49 - check and make sure
82:51 - okay still not let's see if we're
82:53 - getting any errors though okay no errors
82:56 - oops not on the console all right no
82:58 - errors which is good
83:01 - let's see if we can do that and
83:03 - yeah i was wondering if we can make an
83:04 - error by typing in some gibberish but
83:07 - still no errors so that's good
83:09 - okay let's see
83:13 - render section title
83:16 - let's check out where that's at render
83:19 - render section title
83:22 - all right actually that's not it we want
83:24 - not the section
83:25 - we want the suggestion
83:34 - hmm
83:35 - and let's say
83:38 - instead of the hit let's let's see if we
83:40 - can get the title to render
83:44 - here
83:46 - i'm not really sure what
83:51 - yeah i'm
83:55 - there's got to be some documentation for
83:57 - this that i'm missing that explains more
83:59 - about what what this does
84:07 - failed prop type
84:10 - string supply it's a highlighter
84:11 - expected okay so it does expect an
84:13 - object not a string so let's bring it
84:15 - back down the head
84:20 - okay
84:27 - oh okay
84:29 - that's a great idea let's log this
84:37 - we're gonna console log hit
84:40 - just to see what we're getting and that
84:41 - was
84:44 - destroyer of worlds says log the object
84:47 - great idea
84:49 - when all else fails
84:50 - console log to the rescue
84:54 - i'm just i'm going to do that to um
84:59 - just to clear the console
85:02 - all right let's see what we get whoa
85:05 - all right
85:08 - up here
85:12 - okay so this is what
85:13 - we get when we get uh hits
85:16 - so
85:17 - it should be hit
85:19 - dot
85:21 - and this post
85:23 - title would give us the title
85:38 - okay um
85:50 - maybe wasn't the same name before
85:53 - maybe it's looking for the attribute and
85:56 - it's going to highlight that so maybe
85:58 - what we need to do is say
86:04 - maybe it's going to use this value
86:07 - for the search well it's worth a try
86:08 - we'll figure it out in a second
86:15 - yes that was it okay cool
86:19 - yeah who needs
86:20 - documentation trial and error right
86:25 - all right cool
86:26 - so all right so that's that's what we
86:28 - need basically it will show
86:32 - uh whatever we put in here
86:36 - tag name
86:38 - i don't know what this tag name thing is
86:40 - um
86:42 - let's try to give it another value uh
86:45 - let's give it this post type value and
86:48 - see what happens
87:03 - okay so i don't know what that is
87:06 - it didn't do anything visually let's see
87:08 - if it did anything down here
87:10 - oh post type
87:14 - what's bio highlighted
87:21 - it's supposed to be highlighted
87:23 - and it's not
87:26 - interesting
87:43 - hmm
87:49 - let's see
88:04 - all right this class is supposed to be
88:06 - highlighting it but it looks like
88:08 - i don't know maybe we're missing some
88:09 - styles
88:16 - but i still can't find
88:22 - what happened
88:26 - yeah i don't know what this uh
88:28 - tag name
88:30 - is for but
88:31 - at least we know we can get
88:33 - that uh displayed which is cool
88:52 - okay viple says the name that you are
88:54 - giving to tag name is becoming the tag
88:57 - name
89:00 - um
89:09 - oh
89:16 - okay
89:35 - no it's not
89:56 - okay yeah so
89:57 - the
90:00 - the post type
90:02 - should be campus security but if we
90:05 - search that's not actually listed
90:07 - anywhere on the page
90:08 - kept here but this is not
90:10 - it has extra stuff there so that's not
90:12 - it so i'm not exactly sure what this is
90:15 - doing right now
90:21 - all right but this is this is good um
90:24 - this at least lets us know
90:30 - like what
90:33 - it's working we can get the data back
90:35 - and we can display the data on the page
90:38 - right so
90:41 - this is good news
90:44 - and what we'll be able to do then let's
90:46 - see the data we have
90:50 - make sure we have the the proper data
90:53 - okay so what we need is
91:02 - okay so we definitely need the title
91:06 - and
91:09 - content
91:11 - or i should say we don't
91:13 - we don't necessarily need to show the
91:15 - content i guess we just need to make
91:17 - sure that i get searched
91:22 - if we have an image it'll be cool to
91:24 - show the thumbnail image the only piece
91:26 - of data that we're really that we're
91:27 - missing that's
91:29 - very important is
91:30 - we have a special field called
91:33 - uh what's it called
91:36 - called search url
91:38 - and
91:40 - that was added with a wordpress plugin
91:42 - called
91:44 - advanced custom fields i need to
91:47 - create a plug-in to be able uh to have
91:51 - algolia
91:53 - through the algolia wordpress plug-in be
91:55 - able to get the data that's in advanced
91:58 - custom fields
91:59 - so
92:01 - i can't
92:03 - complete this until i do that
92:06 - so that's definitely going to be
92:09 - i mean that's a crucial step that has to
92:11 - be done
92:18 - and it would also be good to find some
92:21 - documentation for what what i can do
92:23 - with this component this uh
92:26 - autocompletes
92:30 - or is it auto suggests was i searching
92:32 - for the wrong thing the whole time
92:34 - i was
92:57 - hmm
93:02 - where is auto suggest from
93:14 - so
93:25 - hmm
93:28 - okay so this is why i couldn't find
93:30 - documentation i think this is a
93:32 - completely separate
93:33 - thing
93:37 - okay
93:52 - there we go
93:54 - cool look at this we got all the props
93:57 - right
93:58 - nice
94:00 - now we can see what this is
94:19 - all right so
94:20 - suggestion
94:21 - value implemented to teach auto suggests
94:24 - what should be the input value when
94:26 - suggestion is clicked
94:30 - okay
94:33 - render suggestion
94:36 - okay so in render suggestion we could do
94:38 - whatever we want
94:40 - all right so that's that's pretty cool
94:42 - um input props pass through arbitrary
94:45 - props to the input
94:46 - must sustain at least value not change
94:48 - okay
94:50 - go to everything just
94:52 - it's just highlighted we'll be called
94:54 - every time the highlighting session
94:55 - changes
94:56 - should render suggestions all these
94:58 - other suggestions
95:07 - all right there's all kind of cool stuff
95:09 - i'm not going to read through all this
95:10 - right now on the stream that will be
95:12 - boring for you all but this is really
95:14 - cool
95:15 - i'm gonna
95:16 - paste this in the
95:19 - live chat and that way if you all want
95:20 - to check that out you can
95:22 - but this seems
95:24 - really cool like uh we could definitely
95:27 - do a lot with it
95:28 - and customize
95:30 - let's see render suggestions
95:48 - okay so we're getting i wondered where
95:50 - we were bringing in highlight we're
95:52 - pulling in highlight from instant
95:54 - search all right so if we want to know
95:56 - what's going on with highlight we need
95:58 - to look that up in the instant search
96:01 - documentation
96:05 - there we go
96:23 - all right we use the mark tag to
96:25 - highlight this tag is specifically made
96:28 - for highlighting pieces of text the
96:30 - default tag
96:31 - is em
96:32 - mostly for legacy okay
96:35 - so this
96:36 - is the actual html tag that gets used
96:39 - then interesting
96:41 - let's see what that looks we should be
96:42 - able to see that now
96:48 - now that i know what i'm looking for
96:51 - yay look at that so post
96:54 - it's literally taking the word post type
96:56 - and putting it there that makes sense
96:58 - now
96:59 - so we could
97:01 - throw in mark and see what that looks
97:03 - like
97:08 - okay now we can see the highlighting is
97:10 - working
97:11 - that makes a lot of sense
97:14 - all right cool
97:16 - so
97:18 - highlight yes so this just says what we
97:20 - want to highlight
97:27 - create a custom hit widget we create a
97:30 - custom widget for the results
97:37 - oh okay
97:46 - interesting
97:57 - hmm
98:06 - so i wonder if we could do something
98:08 - like
98:21 - i wonder if this will work if we could
98:23 - do this
98:44 - so i started using a different keyboard
98:45 - at home so my typing is like
98:50 - all over the place
98:51 - i think because of this
98:53 - um
98:55 - let's see if we can get content to show
98:57 - up here
98:58 - i want to see if i can put both of them
99:00 - together if it'll work
99:05 - yes
99:06 - check that out
99:08 - nice
99:10 - so oops didn't mean to click on that
99:17 - nice
99:19 - let's just throw in a an ugly br in here
99:22 - for a second
99:33 - what it didn't work
99:34 - all right
99:36 - anyway that's really cool so
99:41 - that's awesome
99:45 - alright anyway my timer went off so
99:48 - for now
99:51 - i think we made a lot of good progress
99:53 - not ready to go live with it just yet
99:55 - but
99:58 - it came really far it's
100:02 - it's nice
100:05 - so let me go back to the chat
100:08 - right where i left off at
100:10 - i'm gonna answer all your questions
100:18 - okay
100:20 - first i need to take a drink of this
100:23 - g-fuel
100:24 - because i'm tired
100:28 - i haven't said this in a while but if
100:29 - anybody from g-fuel is watching
100:34 - uh i would definitely allow you to have
100:36 - the honor of me sponsoring you
100:42 - just if you give me some
100:44 - free g fuel
100:46 - i would
100:47 - shout it out on the show
100:55 - just a suggestion started out there
100:59 - or if you're a rival company 2g fuel
101:02 - i would be interested in switching
101:06 - if i could get free stuff
101:08 - that has caffeine in it
101:16 - all right
101:19 - i'm sorry i lost my place i'm just
101:21 - stalling okay here's my
101:23 - it's a question
101:26 - okay
101:30 - 12 35 what am i listening to
101:33 - i'm like distracted by this atlantis
101:35 - morissette song that's playing right now
101:37 - on my headphones i had 90s music playing
101:41 - it says how does it get all that data
101:43 - does it send a get request so we're
101:45 - talking about algolia does it send a
101:47 - gate request per letter you type to
101:49 - algolia which does what amounts uh to
101:53 - magic and then sends back a response
101:57 - um
102:22 - um let's see
102:31 - uh let's see what it does
102:42 - uh we can go
102:45 - let's move the console back in so we can
102:48 - see it at the same time
102:52 - what is that
102:55 - okay so we'll we'll keep the console
102:58 - here
103:01 - and
103:03 - let's see what's happening
103:09 - yeah it looks like we're getting data
103:10 - back on every
103:13 - on every click we can look at the
103:14 - network
103:16 - um at the xhr request and see
103:21 - should we go
103:24 - actually it's hard to see there's too
103:25 - many
103:29 - all right but i mean that's a lot of
103:31 - requests so i'm well yeah i'm guessing
103:33 - on every single time we type i have no
103:35 - idea how it does it that fast uh but
103:38 - that's that's pretty cool
103:40 - we can check
103:41 - our dashboard and see
103:43 - i wonder if it'll tell us like the
103:45 - activity
103:49 - 24
103:50 - minutes
103:52 - wow yeah so in the last 20 last 24 hours
103:56 - we had 455 queries
103:58 - uh 90 of queries under 15 milliseconds
104:04 - wow that's cool
104:23 - let's see
104:40 - okay so there's a conversation going on
104:42 - a little side conversation about
104:45 - this all stem from birthdays and age and
104:50 - keto and weight loss so
104:52 - it's has
104:53 - i've seen so mad that's just saying i've
104:54 - seen a couple of people do the snake
104:57 - keto
104:58 - diet and drop a billion pounds quick i'm
105:00 - not a huge cake fan but sweet coffee is
105:03 - my weakness
105:04 - so
105:06 - i just brought that up because uh i
105:09 - i did earlier in the year i did like
105:11 - kind of a really strict diet and i
105:13 - wasn't trying to do keto but it ended up
105:15 - being kind of like a keto diet and i did
105:18 - i lost
105:19 - like 15 pounds
105:21 - uh and it it was like somewhat quickly
105:24 - so definitely worked but i
105:27 - it's funny because part of the thing
105:28 - that i did have to give up was like
105:31 - putting a lot of stuff in my coffee
105:33 - so i got in the habit of just drinking
105:34 - black coffee because it's you know
105:36 - almost no calories
105:38 - so you just drink black coffee all day
105:41 - caffeine's like kind of an appetite
105:42 - suppressant and you feel kind of full so
105:45 - anyway
105:46 - just just reminded me i'm back on a diet
105:49 - but it's way more relaxed
105:52 - at this point
106:02 - john hanson says uh it is fast it's
106:04 - going round trip to google where pista
106:06 - is oh actually so we're not going around
106:08 - trips so this may explain a little bit
106:09 - about why this is fast
106:13 - so we have a round trip
106:16 - not back to wordpress but what we've
106:18 - done is we've exported as json
106:21 - all of the data in wordpress
106:23 - and it's just sits here in you know on
106:26 - algolia servers or whatever so it just
106:29 - goes to there it grabs that data and
106:31 - comes back
106:32 - so
106:33 - i think that helps explain some of the
106:35 - speed that it doesn't have to go through
106:37 - wordpress through php into
106:41 - my sequel and then back out
106:44 - which uh you know that saves a lot of
106:46 - time
107:05 - see
107:10 - nikki says uh front end masters is free
107:12 - right now can't follow any lessons there
107:14 - now sadly but i recommend to check it
107:16 - out oh cool all right so everybody uh
107:19 - front end masters is free right now so
107:21 - check it out
107:23 - i can't i don't remember if i've ever
107:24 - done one of their courses or not but
107:26 - i've heard good things about them so if
107:28 - you're looking for a course
107:29 - um
107:30 - you know definitely check that out
107:34 - michael says earlier we were talking
107:36 - about how i i did get a lot of
107:38 - complaints i don't know about a lot but
107:39 - um
107:40 - very um
107:43 - intense complaints about
107:46 - the
107:47 - new website
107:48 - not um showing the university as being
107:52 - really catholic so like here's the new
107:54 - site
107:55 - um and michael says isn't the name
107:58 - franciscan kind of a giveaway that is
107:59 - catholic yeah i mean i i think there's a
108:02 - good argument to be made that the the
108:04 - university uh already has enough
108:06 - catholic stuff associated with it that
108:08 - we're not really at risk of losing that
108:10 - just because we
108:12 - uh don't explicitly talk about it on the
108:14 - homepage like our logo has a cross in it
108:17 - um we do have the name franciscan right
108:20 - so
108:21 - i mean there's
108:22 - uh there's something to be said for that
108:25 - but uh it wasn't an unreasonable
108:27 - suggestion that maybe we put something a
108:30 - little bit more overtly uh catholic
108:33 - you know on the website so
108:36 - um
108:37 - so since i wasn't really opposed to the
108:39 - idea you know i i put it there but i i
108:42 - mean i think
108:44 - based on the data that we have we we do
108:47 - have um a problem with the
108:50 - the perception
108:52 - that
108:53 - our academic programs aren't as good as
108:56 - academic programs from other schools
108:57 - okay so i don't know that that's true
109:01 - but that's the perception that we got
109:03 - back from from some uh surveys and stuff
109:06 - so that's what we want to try to
109:08 - showcase what we do have so people
109:10 - realize what that we have a lot of good
109:12 - stuff going on here academically as well
109:22 - char bill says
109:23 - ask for a quick tutorial on ngrok
109:27 - i don't really know much about ngrok
109:28 - other than it works it's a command line
109:30 - tool
109:31 - uh you just start running a server
109:33 - locally and then you put in
109:36 - you just run a command basically saying
109:38 - ngrok here's where my server is port
109:41 - 3000 you hit enter and it it gives you
109:44 - these urls and it does everything else
109:48 - so um they have free plans that are
109:51 - pretty limited uh
109:54 - incontrivable who built ngrok was
109:56 - extremely generous and allows us to
109:59 - basically have an unlimited free plan
110:01 - for free codecamp live streams
110:04 - otherwise if you want to be able to have
110:05 - a lot of users at the same time a lot of
110:08 - people accessing your url you do need to
110:10 - have uh you know a paid plan i think
110:12 - it's a monthly thing
110:14 - but that's pretty much it i mean in
110:16 - terms of like setup and what you need to
110:18 - do it's
110:19 - you know really easy there's like a few
110:20 - steps to set it up but once you do it
110:23 - like you're good it's set up forever on
110:24 - that computer
110:38 - all right
111:01 - i'm trying to find a question there's a
111:03 - lot of like back and forth talk between
111:04 - everybody in the live chat which is
111:06 - awesome
111:07 - but if anybody's interested you can read
111:09 - the the live chat when you're watching
111:11 - this later on but i'm not going to read
111:13 - it all out
111:14 - uh let's see
111:16 - uh rithik says what is the name of the
111:18 - software visual basic uh sorry if it
111:20 - sound weird but i don't know it's um
111:22 - visual studio code i think you're
111:25 - referring to the code editor visual
111:26 - studio code
111:31 - thanks that dutchess says uh there's
111:34 - nothing wrong with bald for guys anyway
111:36 - earlier somebody said that i i think
111:38 - they were trying to say that i was gonna
111:39 - go bald
111:41 - which may be true
111:42 - uh and i said i didn't want to go bald
111:44 - matt duchess says there's nothing wrong
111:45 - with bald well i thank you i appreciate
111:47 - it i actually used to shave my head
111:49 - um
111:50 - it was especially nice like during the
111:52 - summer time it's nice and cool
111:54 - uh you can wear a hat you don't mess up
111:56 - your hair like you're basically your
111:58 - hair never get gets messed up because
111:59 - you don't have any so it wouldn't be
112:02 - like completely weird but i like the
112:04 - option of having hair
112:19 - oh nikki says so nikki i think correct
112:22 - me if i'm wrong but i think you're
112:23 - talking about this
112:25 - said you had no idea at first what the
112:27 - this number was in the top
112:29 - until you saw it was a tell link
112:33 - as did anybody else have that impression
112:35 - is it obvious that this is a phone
112:36 - number
112:38 - or not if it's not obvious what could i
112:40 - do
112:41 - that would look nice that would make it
112:44 - more obvious that this is a phone number
112:47 - because i
112:49 - i mean i obviously knew it's a phone
112:50 - number because i put it in there but
112:52 - i don't know how it appears to other
112:54 - people so let let me know
112:57 - um do you think this is obvious enough
113:00 - or not
113:01 - if not what should i do
113:08 - uh
113:09 - julio says try this cool new extension
113:12 - for live sessions vs live stream vs code
113:15 - that's that is really awesome i've heard
113:16 - of that i haven't had a chance to use it
113:18 - yet but i
113:19 - i would love to
113:21 - um
113:22 - to use it at some point
113:25 - eva says you should bind your class
113:26 - methods or use arrow functions uh like
113:29 - methods of class
113:31 - um
113:33 - yeah
113:34 - i wonder
113:36 - at that point in the stream
113:38 - i wonder if i had already i was copying
113:40 - and pasting a lot of code
113:42 - so that may have been stuff i copy and
113:44 - paste it in
113:45 - um
113:47 - if not if it was stuff i had already
113:48 - coded then
113:50 - let me know because i if i can improve
113:52 - it i definitely want to
113:54 - so anyway thank you for mentioning that
113:56 - ava
114:21 - let's see
114:22 - dextre of world says are you using sass
114:25 - or style components uh
114:29 - no we're using
114:32 - what are we we're using a variety of
114:34 - we're not using either one of those
114:36 - we're using like plain css inline css i
114:39 - don't even know what's it called css and
114:41 - js is that what's called when we do the
114:44 - um
114:45 - css as a javascript object so we have a
114:48 - variety of methods unfortunately i don't
114:50 - have sas
114:51 - uh set up
114:54 - so but i normally do prefer to use sas
114:56 - i've used style components a little bit
114:59 - before in another project and
115:01 - i think i
115:03 - i think they would be cool if i knew
115:04 - more about them
115:06 - but i'm not comfortable enough with them
115:08 - yet to really be good with them
115:20 - nikki says was that atlantis morrissette
115:22 - song called ironic
115:24 - cause it's like rain incomprehensible
115:27 - gibberish no it wasn't ironic what was
115:28 - the one
115:29 - what's it called let me check
115:35 - it was uh you oughta know that was what
115:37 - it was called
115:40 - it's actually kind of like hardcore
115:42 - atlantis moreso was pretty hardcore back
115:44 - in the day
115:46 - that was from the jagged little pill
115:48 - album
115:55 - john hanson says i'm doing keto drop 20
115:57 - pounds awesome
115:58 - congratulations i said i also do
116:00 - intermittent fasting no more afternoon
116:03 - energy crash and better focus than ever
116:05 - workouts are much better too that's
116:07 - awesome
116:08 - that's that's really cool
116:13 - uh codaly says hi there hey how's it
116:16 - going
116:17 - carlos says
116:18 - having been a university psychology
116:20 - professor for 11 years i don't think
116:22 - that overtly showing that the university
116:24 - of catholic is a is a plus um
116:30 - yeah
116:31 - this university is a little bit like um
116:34 - so there's like a small niche of uh
116:36 - universities that
116:38 - attract like um
116:43 - let's say like very devout catholic
116:46 - students and families
116:47 - uh so franciscan university is is one of
116:50 - those one of the leading universities
116:52 - that does that so
116:54 - um the families that send their their
116:56 - kids here kids that come here like
116:58 - basically are looking for a place where
117:01 - um
117:02 - they won't feel like an outsider
117:05 - for being a devout catholic you know um
117:09 - so it is kind of it it is a plus for
117:11 - what we
117:12 - for our target audience
117:15 - so
117:16 - uh and that was what some of the
117:18 - students and some of the professors were
117:20 - worried about was
117:22 - like are we dropping that you know or
117:24 - are we trying to attract you know
117:26 - different students now are we trying so
117:29 - i mean that really it wasn't what we
117:30 - were doing at all in fact we were just
117:33 - unfortunately what we have happened
117:34 - sometimes is a student will really want
117:36 - to come here
117:38 - you know because of the reputation that
117:41 - this is a good place where you can come
117:42 - you don't have to worry about a lot of
117:44 - bad stuff going on
117:46 - but
117:48 - they didn't feel like they get a good
117:50 - academic education in whatever
117:52 - particular field they wanted to go into
117:54 - so they went somewhere else
117:56 - so
117:57 - our attempt the idea was okay well let's
117:59 - let those students know
118:01 - that we also have good academics right
118:03 - so
118:04 - carlos i think you're right for for a
118:06 - large majority of of people out there
118:09 - you know they they would either could
118:10 - care less about the
118:12 - to university being catholic or it might
118:14 - be a negative thing
118:16 - but like i said we have a kind of a
118:17 - unique niche that we're in right now
118:22 - uh carlos says i would go with what you
118:24 - would research or do a blind test
118:25 - showing click-through rate with the
118:27 - catholic symbol or without it and see
118:29 - which gives you better click-through
118:30 - rate for action actually i do i really
118:32 - want to do um some some tests on
118:36 - different
118:37 - like different images and different
118:39 - things we do and measure click-through
118:41 - rates so
118:42 - that's going to be something that i hope
118:44 - to get set up soon
118:46 - so that we can really measure those
118:47 - things so that when people come to me
118:49 - with with ideas or criticisms or
118:52 - complaints i can have this data to show
118:55 - like you know i can see why you feel
118:57 - that way but that's not really what's
118:59 - happening you know and show them i mean
119:01 - also i'd like to know what works you
119:03 - know maybe i'm mistaken maybe they're
119:05 - right you know so
119:07 - i do really want to have that data
119:08 - that's a great idea
119:12 - oh okay um i had asked about the phone
119:15 - number
119:17 - and um
119:20 - several of you are saying put a phone
119:22 - icon in front of it that is a great idea
119:26 - that's a great idea i'm gonna add that
119:28 - to my trello board right now
119:32 - so i got let me bring over my trello
119:35 - board just so y'all can see what i what
119:36 - i have going on here in case you haven't
119:38 - seen it before so like this is the
119:40 - algolia search thing and we put it we
119:42 - just put in three pomodoro sessions so
119:44 - i'm gonna up this to six to say that
119:46 - i've already done six sessions i
119:47 - estimate it would take five but actually
119:50 - this card was just for research so
119:53 - i guess i should do another card for
119:54 - implementation but anyway
119:56 - uh the research part only took me like
119:58 - one pomodoro session before i figured
120:00 - out i definitely want to use this but
120:02 - let's say add
120:16 - okay and i'm gonna
120:17 - it says add phone number add phone icon
120:20 - in front of that bar phone number i'm
120:21 - gonna estimate that that's gonna take me
120:23 - one pomodoro session
120:25 - and then i am going to assign that to
120:28 - myself
120:30 - there we go
120:32 - all right
120:37 - okay
120:45 - okay nikki says i'm not familiar with
120:47 - that format for the telephone number you
120:48 - know what actually
120:49 - this is not really a common format in
120:51 - the united states i just like it for
120:53 - style reasons
120:55 - so
120:56 - i i think that's
120:58 - you're you're not alone and being
120:59 - unfamiliar with that format i think a
121:01 - lot of people might be and i just didn't
121:03 - i didn't even think about it
121:06 - so normally there would be hyphens and
121:08 - maybe even uh you know parentheses so
121:12 - i think i like the the periods
121:16 - but
121:18 - i i agree that's probably confusing so i
121:20 - think i'm going to go with the icon i'm
121:22 - going to keep the periods but i'm going
121:23 - to go with the phone icon that makes it
121:24 - really obvious
121:31 - all right
121:34 - uh swagga says uh nikki that's how most
121:37 - toll-free numbers look minus the periods
121:39 - in between
121:40 - yeah yeah i mean that's
121:42 - yeah the periods are um
121:45 - uh
121:47 - not not really common i don't really
121:50 - know where i picked that up from but i
121:51 - saw it on a site before and i thought
121:53 - that looks that was kind of cool
121:56 - gerald perez says what are you doing
121:58 - um well we're just kind of finishing up
122:00 - doing some question and answer we did
122:02 - some coding earlier um
122:05 - morrow says that okay so a lot of you
122:08 - say add phone icon i appreciate the
122:09 - feedback from you all i think that's a
122:11 - great idea
122:14 - um it looks like gerald is not a fan of
122:16 - uh atlantis uh
122:19 - elena's morris said so
122:22 - i'm telling her early stuff i think is
122:24 - is pretty good
122:26 - i i think it's better her i'm not a huge
122:29 - fan of her later stuff but she was
122:31 - really edgy at first and it was i liked
122:33 - it
122:35 - um
122:36 - nikki says uh the devout catholics
122:38 - seeing the site will immediately link
122:40 - franciscan with well saint francis so
122:43 - it's not needed in my opinion but i get
122:44 - the point i nikki that is a great point
122:47 - like i like i said i'm not going to make
122:49 - a big deal about it or argue because
122:51 - i mean at the end of the day i want to
122:53 - code i want to make things right that
122:54 - are performant and look nice right so
122:57 - content is not even exactly my thing um
123:01 - and unless it starts affecting
123:02 - performance or like really messing up
123:04 - the look of the site and then i want to
123:05 - get involved
123:06 - uh but i i think you are right i think
123:09 - it's an overreaction on the part of the
123:11 - people that were saying it is that uh
123:14 - you know the the people
123:16 - you're right the people who are devout
123:17 - catholics will know
123:19 - that
123:21 - that franciscan university is
123:24 - a catholic school right and they will
123:26 - will understand the reputation and
123:28 - um there's a ton of other information on
123:31 - the rest of the website in our social
123:33 - media on our youtube that will
123:34 - definitely explain that so
123:37 - yeah i think
123:38 - um having i mean what images do you end
123:41 - up having like this one right with the
123:43 - students praying right
123:45 - images like that i think will help to to
123:49 - you know calm
123:51 - you know so people can just calm down
123:53 - and realize like you know we're not
123:55 - we're not trying to take away anything
123:57 - um
123:59 - so
124:00 - you know i think that'll be good you
124:02 - know but at the same time it is it is
124:03 - kind of odd to see that as like hey i'm
124:04 - looking for university so i can get a
124:06 - degree so i can get a job and this is
124:08 - your image here so it's just like
124:11 - um you know it's it's an interesting
124:13 - thing right there there are several um
124:16 - like schools of thought here on campus
124:18 - about like who we are as a university
124:21 - and um
124:23 - i think there's a a good group of people
124:25 - that realize that we're we're a mix of
124:27 - different things right there's all kind
124:29 - of reasons that people come here but
124:30 - then there's some very opposite groups
124:32 - that say
124:33 - like we need to focus on um
124:36 - academics right academics is the main
124:39 - thing and there are other people saying
124:40 - like no we need to focus on on uh our
124:43 - faith and like that's why people want to
124:44 - come here
124:45 - and
124:46 - so
124:47 - yeah there's a huge difference and then
124:49 - even within the academics it's like some
124:51 - people say well we we don't care about
124:54 - making people job ready we're going to
124:56 - learn for the sake of learning you know
124:57 - and there are other people that are
124:58 - saying no like we need
125:00 - we need to have programs that will
125:02 - enable students to like provide for
125:04 - their families and get jobs and things
125:06 - so there's there's just a whole lot of
125:08 - discussion uh so
125:10 - um
125:12 - you know it
125:14 - and something as visible as the front
125:16 - page of the main website becomes the
125:18 - focus of discussion you know
125:21 - because everybody sees it so anyway
125:26 - uh we actually did have data that showed
125:27 - that students really responded
125:30 - positively to like aerial like drone
125:32 - footage and stuff so that's why we threw
125:33 - this in here
125:35 - um
125:36 - carlos says you guys need to do market
125:37 - research for those things yeah that's
125:39 - the thing like we have market research
125:41 - but
125:42 - number one like it's just not
125:45 - not everybody has seen the research
125:47 - right it's not like we publish it
125:49 - everywhere um
125:51 - although there's no reason why we
125:52 - couldn't
125:53 - so not everybody's seen the research and
125:55 - even when people do see them see the
125:57 - research
126:00 - people
126:01 - want to like think how they want to
126:02 - think right it's hard to convince them
126:04 - otherwise so if they already have this
126:06 - opinion
126:07 - that they hold strongly even when you
126:09 - show them the research they come up with
126:10 - all these reasons why it doesn't matter
126:12 - right so
126:14 - um
126:16 - when i'm gonna make when i make
126:17 - decisions i really try to follow the
126:19 - research that way i always have that to
126:21 - fall back on it's like this is not my
126:23 - opinion or at least
126:24 - it's as little about my opinion as i can
126:27 - make it
126:28 - uh and it's more about the numbers it's
126:30 - more about what we see from the research
126:32 - so
126:33 - uh when i was doing redoing this page
126:36 - for the last time i had a pdf of the
126:39 - market research open at the same time
126:42 - and was looking at it all and saying
126:44 - okay this is what we want i also had
126:46 - like the most visited pages on the
126:48 - website from analytics over the past
126:50 - year up saying like this is what people
126:52 - are clicking on so
126:54 - um
126:55 - anyway
126:57 - so i'm with you right there like carlos
126:59 - i'm i'm totally on board with that i
127:01 - think that's the way we need to go uh we
127:03 - need to get data on everything and we
127:04 - need to actually do things based on that
127:07 - data
127:08 - that's not exactly what how things have
127:10 - been done in the past uh here
127:13 - so
127:14 - it just takes a while for people to
127:16 - switch over and and learn to trust the
127:19 - data
127:20 - and not
127:21 - you know their intuition about
127:23 - about things so
127:25 - uh you know it's just gonna take not
127:27 - everybody's gonna gonna change some
127:29 - people are really excited about the
127:30 - change and they're like yes finally
127:33 - other people
127:34 - you know they they resist it so
127:37 - we'll see how it goes i mean my
127:38 - department is pretty far ahead when it
127:41 - comes to this kind of stuff
127:43 - i've been here three years and since day
127:44 - one i've been trying to get
127:46 - data and make decisions based on data
127:49 - so
127:50 - we've come a long way from where we were
127:53 - uh
127:54 - and
127:56 - hopefully it'll get better but anyway
128:00 - i'm getting far afield from actual
128:02 - coding here
128:04 - uh
128:04 - anyway my department is marketing by the
128:06 - way so i'm not like in it or anything
128:08 - like that i'm in marketing so market
128:10 - research and as much data as we can get
128:12 - from that from our interrelate analytics
128:14 - is very important to us
128:17 - uh
128:18 - let's see
128:19 - oh wow i've been streaming for over two
128:21 - hours now okay so it looks like i've
128:23 - gotten through all the questions thank
128:24 - you all so much for uh for watching and
128:27 - uh for all the help uh there's
128:29 - definitely like several times in the
128:31 - stream where i would have been stuck and
128:33 - i you all y'all helped me out
128:36 - so
128:37 - i appreciate uh you watching and
128:40 - appreciate all the the kind comments uh
128:42 - that you all had today uh man on social
128:45 - media and
128:46 - yeah don't forget to i'm active mostly
128:48 - on twitter and on instagram but
128:51 - you know check check it out like if
128:53 - you're interested i do put some content
128:54 - up on on both of those platforms
128:57 - i also have my own youtube channel
129:00 - you can i think there's a link in the
129:01 - description this video i haven't done
129:03 - anything on there for a while but i
129:05 - really would like to i have some
129:06 - tutorial videos and things like that so
129:08 - if you if you like what i'm doing here
129:10 - and you want to see more of it you can
129:12 - check that out
129:13 - um let's see

129:18 - again thank you so much and have a great
129:20 - weekend i should be back with another
129:22 - stream on monday

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to work on something that i think is really cool we're going to make our search function a lot better because we're going to use algolia and i'll explain what that is but we're going to use algolia to handle all our our search um all like getting all the data going through it all and providing the results and we're just gonna display it with react so that's the plan for today uh first of all i just want to say thank you to everybody uh yesterday who uh provided some encouragement and support to me on twitter and instagram so as many of you know i launched this project last week the one that we've been working on for so long um and so i i got a lot of positive feedback but i did get some negative feedback and um some of it was was very constructive and good and i'm okay with that uh but some of it was um a little bit more mean spirited i guess and didn't really even contain anything constructive um so that was kind of getting me down and i think i've just been stressed because i've been working a lot a lot more than than usual i wasn't feeling well uh because my even though i've i have been trying to exercise regularly i think my immune system was just wearing down so all these factors just combined at the point of yesterday morning i was just feeling down and it just was like you know little bugs in the site kept coming and i kept getting comments from people through email and social media and things that uh you know negative feedback and so i knew like you know i just i know how i am and with my history of depression i knew i got to do something or else i'm going to get really depressed here i'm not going to be able to function so that's why i um i reached out to you all uh on social media and just i'm just you all responded just overwhelmingly and i thank you thank you i really appreciate it and it definitely helped uh it helped me to feel a lot better i mean some of the messages were just amazing and there were some people like i had no idea that some people even knew who i was or watched the show or that i impacted them at all and it was awesome to hear that so i don't want to spend too much time and not do any coding but i just i had to say thank you to you all because that uh it really meant a lot to me and i'm i'm going to be going back and looking at those messages probably many times to you know just give me some motivation and and help me you know stay focused on you know just trying to do the best i can so anyway um i see we have a lot of people here so i'm sure there's new people uh let me explain briefly what's going on here i'm a frontend developer i'm employed fulltime at a small university and this is me doing my everyday work i'm in my office right now i'm about to work on a project the main website for this university that we just launched last week and uh so this is not a tutorial but i do my best to try to explain what i'm doing and i'm welcome to any questions that you have just let me know i'll take breaks periodically and answer questions at the end if there are any questions left i'll answer all your questions so hopefully you can still learn something from me or from the other people in the chat um even though right it's we're kind of going in the middle of the project right we've been working on this project for a really long time this is video 98 so yeah so that's what we're gonna do i'm gonna set a timer here in just a minute and we're gonna start with the code and i'm gonna kind of ignore the chat for a little bit while i code uh and then i'll come back to the chat and catch up on things so let me just very briefly just check out who's in the chat now and say hello uh hey i see a lot of you you're saying hi how's it going um i see there are some questions uh there are a few questions about why i'm using algolia over elasticsearch um so let me address this since it it's definitely gonna deal directly with uh what we're doing um i've tell you truth um i'm really impressed with algolia and yesterday i already put a bunch of data in there uh so i like what i see so i'm open to elasticsearch maybe in the future if i learn more about it and figure out that's a better way to go i'm definitely open to it but for now this is a feature that i really want to get live as soon as possible i'm not satisfied at all with the search that i created before it worked well for some of our previous projects because there was a small amount of data but with such a large amount of data with this site it just does not work there's there's too much it there's too much data for a user to be able to find what they're looking for you know the search we did before was just very simple if that word existed in that particular post it would show up well we're talking about thousands of posts here uh so a user's not gonna be able to scroll through all those uh so this is gonna help and and you'll see uh i'll show you what we can do with this data uh in a little while so if you're still confused about what algolia is or what it's going to do just stick around you know you'll see it in action okay so any of the other questions in there right now i'm going to get to those after we do our first coding session so let me switch my screens here you can see this is the site this morning i added a feature where different images would show up so it's kind of just a random as to what image shows up just a simple uh you know math math.random and uh in javascript and i just put all the images in an array and so it just does a random it grabs a url from the array and puts it in as the background image so if you click you get different images sometimes you click and it's the same one obviously because it's random so i just have some different i had some feedback on the images and they said it'd be nice to get images from different parts of campus and about different things going on um i did i definitely i got the most vocal feedback and this actually came from some students where um where actually they said well you know we're we're a catholic college but it doesn't really say anything about us being catholic on the uh main page except for this little thing right here and that was actually true uh it was kind of not really my intention to to do that i just kind of wanted to highlight all of our degrees because i wanted people to know we have really good academics here uh and from our research it showed that that was an area that we could improve on uh in terms of the public's opinion of our university uh but i threw some pictures in there see this is our original picture and uh actually from what i heard um these two women um saw this this picture and we're sharing it on social media and we're excited that they got on the website so i actually don't know who they are uh i just this picture i thought was really great to put on here shows women in stem and they just looked really joyful in the picture so i thought this would be a good picture to use but i'm glad that they like it so anyway let's uh let's get started let me go try to find my timer i'm all let's see okay that's better uh i'm going to start up my server let me make this bigger let's start up our dev server i did a get pool this morning so we're all up to date i've been working a lot from home um so i had a ton of of changes um lately i've been i i it seems like i'm busier now after the site launch than i was before the site launched we ended up finding a lot of of broken links because there were multiple urls for each page that i didn't really know about so that was that was a little bit crazy so i think we found almost all the broken links i mean i'm sure we'll find some more but um i'm trying to get some consistency in only having one url go to one page and not have all this stuff everywhere um okay so we got dev servers running now i'll be able to start up ngrok i'm going to copy and paste the link in the live chat right now and that's going to let you all check out the changes we're making to the website in real time and you'll be able to inspect it and everything right there on your machine so i guess i'll go over here and this is the live site this is at franciscan.edu you could check that out if you want um but i'm gonna go to localhost right now and i'm gonna put this on a different branch let me make this a bit bigger i think that's probably still too small okay so down here in my my terminal and i'm using visual studio code i know usually people ask about this and i just have the the little terminal option down there so if you go to view you can open your terminal right there and i always have two open one to run the uh dev server and the other one for commands usually like git commands but i'm going to go to a different branch right now and if you're not familiar with git uh it's basically like i can test out some things like a separate version of my project without messing up my main version that that i'm gonna push to my live server at some point so this will let us work without having to worry about breaking something because if we do we can always switch back to master branch make a quick change if we need to right so that's that's why i'm going to make this branch so i'm going to do a git checkout with a b flag that b flag is what's going to make the branch check out's actually going to switch us to the branch so we're combining two git commands and then after that i just type the name of the branch so this is going to be let's just call it search hopefully hopefully i don't have a branch called search all right nice i thought i might so we have a new branch called search and now what i'd like to do is i'm going to use a package from algolia called react instant search so i'm just going to copy and paste what they have in their uh instructions and get so that's yarn add react instant search dom and then algolia um algolia search so while that's loading up i'm going to paste i'm going to copy and paste into the live chat the link to this uh repository okay so if you want to check out this this package there's the link right there also let me give you a link to the documentation so you can check that out as well the second link is the documentation and then we'll go i'll show you the algolia dashboard and what's going on over there in just a minute all right so all of this is now loaded and i'm going to try to do just something really basic first to make sure everything works we're definitely i'm going to have to set up some api keys before it will work with the data that i brought in so let's get that running and i need to i'm just going to copy and paste the basic getting started code so you'll see it in a second when i paste it in here and let's see let's just do this on the search page so we already have a search page but what i'd like to do here is i guess add this search in hmm let's get rid of you know let's not get rid of anything for right now let's just add this in and then we know we'll probably end up getting rid of most of this but for now i just want a page where we can view what's happening so right here in this grid where we have our original search whoa and i tried to copy everything in there and that was that was a bad move okay let me do this a better way okay so i'm just gonna copy this component into in here oops and i don't even need this okay so we have this instant search component and we're going to pass in the index name and the search client so i don't have an index called best buy i'm going to have to figure out where my index i do believe i have an index called faculty or something like that uh let's see yeah wp post faculty so let's use that okay so i'm gonna this index um contains all of the data we have on faculty so all of our faculty profiles uh this one's kind of cool because we should also be able to pull images since we have featured images so hopefully we can get that working and then our search results will contain little thumbnail images as well which is kind of it looks kind of cool looks fancy right um now our search client we need to uh pass in some data for that and i'm gonna need to probably put that in a dot end file so i don't put all of my api keys out there let me see what i need i may need search clan index settings components to your app all right um if you're following along let me you know let me bring some of this over so you can see what i'm looking at so here's oops not that or am i looking okay here we go so here's the um documentation and then this is the readme for the github page so i'm right here i've just been copying and pasting some of this over and let me grab this while i'm here and i while i remember we'll just pop this down here okay i'll go with this um and then we need to do we need to bring this in and we can put this i guess wherever let's just put it right here it'll be easier less less scrolling around um so i'm not sure what values need to be here so that's what we need to look up so let's just check here in the documentation see if we can find it hmm okay it looks like this one is it's a little bit different huh all right let me know if you if you are seeing what i'm seeing here it looks like the instructions are different here and here i wonder let's see when the last time the readme was updated readme was updated a month ago so i'd say that's that's pretty new we're looking at i don't know what version this is okay i'm gonna check the chat too uh just to see if if you all notice something um api id and key okay uh hardship from the live chat is saying the one on github is old is that use the docs okay cool um okay and michael creole was saying the app id is latency the api key and the index name okay cool so actually this shouldn't be a problem for me to put this uh in here because it's not my secret api key right so uh algolia uh can be used clientside so like it it should be fine uh in terms of your your api will be fine right nobody's going to get access to be able to change anything on your api they maybe could pull data from your api which in my opinion is fine right because this is all information we want the public to have so uh why not give it to them all right so let's do that let me go to on my other screen i am going to go to my dashboard just to grab my api keys actually yeah let me show you the dashboard because the uh the secret api key is um is hidden right so nobody can see that anyway so i'm okay with that so this is the algolia dashboard we've gone to api keys and this is our application id i'm going to copy that and let's put it uh actually let's let's go with what the doc said um actually the docs don't even have me using algolia search so maybe i don't need that all right so let's let's go with what they say here let's get rid of this and get rid of this and scroll down there we go okay so we're not gonna have search client i'm gonna paste this we already have index name so let's get rid of that now we can throw in our app id oops our app id and our api key okay let's save that and let's see oh harshit says uh it's feeling too sleepy today see you horseshit i know it's really late where you're at thank you so much for uh for joining us and for helping out okay so hopefully everything else is okay i know i kind of switched instructions there in the middle we could probably get rid of i'm not gonna do it right now we can clean it up later but we may not need that algolia search package that i loaded so maybe i'll get rid of that in a little bit but first let's just see if if this is working uh let's see all right so it says use widgets here which it looks like we've already put in yeah we put in a search box and it hits so let's see if anything shows up uh you all may already know you may be going to that page already so i'm gonna go to search and see hmm nothing showing up here yes so it looks like nothing is rendering let me i want to inspect this and just see if anything is there see what's going on inspect oh it's popping up on my other screen let's see so it should be hmm yeah that's weird all right let's insert search box it's all right let's go back to the uh documentation i feel like i can't talk today i keep like searching for the words i'm pretty tired i was up before 5 a.m today it was actually exciting so there's a conference in russia a javascript conference called uh holy js and it's held i think twice a year once in moscow and once i can't remember the other location uh but i got uh i guess kind of interviewed to be a speaker at the one in moscow at the end of november so i had to do the interview at a time that was convenient in moscow time so it was 1 p.m in moscow when i did the interview but it was 6 00 am where i'm at so i wanted to make sure i got up early and was prepared so i may be speaking about how we built this app at a conference in russia in november i really hope i get to go uh because i've never been out of the country um oh i am gonna go to germany though for the um for uh the doc fest uh conference so that'll be cool so i may go from being 30 i'll be 33 in october so i'll go from being 33 years old never leave in the country to go into two foreign countries in november maybe that'll be fun all right let's see what our widgets are okay so search box that's good we did that right search box okay and then all right let's see about styling the widgets maybe i don't i mean it just it seems like i should see something without the styling right anything hmm maybe i'll i'm going to get rid of hits because i don't really know what that does right now and i'd rather keep it simple just you know if we're just trying to make this work so let's get rid of that and let's also get rid of see i don't want to try to i don't want to get rid of too much and then have let's just move this somewhere uh my fear is that i start removing this stuff and then it causes errors and then i have to try to go back and see it we're going to take up half the stream just removing things so uh let's see let's just throw something in here put a little further down the page maybe we'll have better luck if it's showing up yay look we got something so right here we have a search whoops i accidentally clicked on a link okay so we have a search here uh let's see what happens um uh let's see if we can find some uh education faculty members search okay nothing happened i'm gonna check the console i have it open another screen and it looks like we're getting an error hmm all right let me show you the air we're getting okay oh it's not here let me make this bigger okay okay so it failed failed loading post so it looks like it was trying to get something and failed and we got some errors here which tell you truth i'm not 100 sure this is just from algolia i i suspect it is but i'm trying to see i don't see anything that says for sure that it's coming from there so i guess we'll try um so it's trying to make a call let's see what's happening here's all our algolia queries and we can see let's let's make this large so we can kind of see what's happening um here's the results that we get um from the index post faculty and it looks like yeah we're getting we're getting data right so we we have here um dr alex plato i just saw him earlier today he's a good guy um he's also a philosophy professor and he has the best name for a philosophy professor okay so we we actually did get the data i'm just not exactly sure why what happened here okay so we got the data it's just not displayed let's look at our console again so it failed no that's not it there we go okay so it looks like it failed up here but it actually worked down here so maybe let's just get rid of everything uh restart it and then see what's happening if i can find here we are okay um let's just try it again we'll hit search again um let me refresh and then we'll do a search all right actually let me check first okay looks like we're getting whatever errors we just got before may not even be due to algolia let's go i'm gonna search again and see what happens interesting okay so it seems like we fail first and then it works um but in any case nothing is actually being displayed so let's go back to our documentation in about three minutes i'm going to go back and answer some things in the live chat harshit says you need hits component to display data thanks harshit i guess that component i just deleted was more important than i thought so let's throw that back in there we'll put it down under the search box the hits component and we'll go up here and make sure we import hits component hardship i thought you're going to sleep but you came back to save the day thank you okay oops let's hey look at this we we have it it looks not great but we have it cool so the data's here um look it's a live search so i just type biology let me zoom in this is so i just typed in biology and we get the the data uh let's type in i don't know see if we have anybody named joe no no jojo's there we go we do have some josephs though that that works um cool all right so next step then we need to make this look good we it's working obviously uh so that's important right it it's it's on the site we're getting the data it works here's the next steps because the timer's about to go off so i'm going to do these next steps just so we know where to pick off all right um not only do we need to make it look good which is definitely important but we've only searched for faculty right i have a lot of other things i want to search for so right now every post type is an individual index in algolia so we need to figure out how do you search multiple indices with algolia uh michael says that's fast yeah it's insanely fast it's so much faster than what we built so it's definitely it's better in many ways um so we need to probably the first thing we should do is make sure we have all the data in order so let's figure out how to search multiple indices then once we see what all the data is going to be like then we can figure out how we're going to display it first thing we'll do though is uh before we try to make our own solution we'll see what solution comes prepackaged with algolia i think that styling section that i skipped over is probably going to come in handy here so that's what we'll look for if we like how algolia styles it then maybe we'll do it like that hopefully maybe it'll work right off the bat maybe some minimal styling changes and then we can have this thing live like before i leave today which would be awesome okay short break i'm gonna go to the live chat i'm scrolling all the way up to the top i'm gonna answer as many questions as i can uh let's see just a lot of people saying hello so i'm not gonna read out all the individual hellos but i am reading them so i know that you said hi and i'm saying hi back uh mauro says uh if possible use test driven development i know i know i i need to be better with using tests and um i'm just always busy and i don't make it a priority realistically i mean that's that's the truth if if i made it a priority i would probably do it um but it's so tempting to just you know get code written without worrying about tests uh so i need to do a better job at that and um feel free to call me out on that if you all see me doing it too uh maybe i ought to take a course on um tests writing tests uh and part of the reason why i don't do it is because i just don't feel confident in my skills at it so that might be a good idea um karma says you're doing an amazing job don't listen to the negative feedback thank you i appreciate that i appreciate it i mean i sometimes there's some truth in the negative feedback so i'm just i'm trying to i'm trying to read it hear it you know and and see like what what is the truth to it um so like some of the feedback about not actually showing any not giving any indication that this is a catholic university you know the way that people were saying it was kind of mean but the truth was yeah actually i mean the previous website it was really obvious in this website it wasn't so the truth was hey maybe i wouldn't include some type of image that would show that so i mean it it's true but it you know when you get so much of that uh it does just kind of wear you down like even if i'm trying to to ignore it you know it still gets it's in there you know it's in your brain lorehan says uh uh a word i can't say uh to the haters no worries you're doing a majestic job oh i love that i'm a majestic job thank you i appreciate that morrow says algolia uses elasticsearch in the background it just makes it easy to implement oh awesome that's really cool i did not realize that um euro says you're looking bad don't take it so close to your heart oh well thank you i i appreciate the sentiment that stinks that i'm looking bad but like realistically my my eyes were probably red like i'm i was up super early uh let's see morrow says algolia is better for just front end devs if you're a full stack you can use elasticsearch so you have more control over the search okay good to know good to know like i said maybe i'll check it out at some point and use it on a future project or work it into this project seems like something maybe i'd i'd need to research a little bit more to get right though uh tripp says do you enjoy your job uh not are you happy with it but do you enjoy it i i really i do enjoy my job i mean there are always parts of a job that you don't enjoy so um uh sometimes like the the attitude of people that i work with not necessarily in my own department but like in the the larger organization um is frustrating um so i don't necessarily enjoy that part of my job uh but i do enjoy what i do i enjoy building um websites apps uh making them look nice making them fast and through that helping people to get information or do their jobs you know better uh than they did before i mean i think that's really cool um that's that's pretty awesome so i definitely enjoy that trip says as much as you did when you started coding honestly i think i enjoy what i do now more than i did when i started because i'm better at it now before there was just so much i had to think about everything everything was hard right there was so much that i didn't know and uh so much that i was like i don't know if i can do that now uh i know i'm more confident in the things that i know and i'm okay with the things that i don't know right i realize that i can't be an expert at everything so i've just been able to let go and not worry that i'm not an expert at everything and just say you know what like i'm i'm gonna do what i know how to do i'm gonna try to learn as much as i can but at the end of the day like i'm gonna try to produce something awesome you know no matter what technology end up using or whatever like um so i i like that uh i don't know i think it can be like that with everything when you first start something it's it's fun because it's new right but then you get into this area where like you start to realize um how bad you are at it because you're new and then it's not as fun because you see other people doing awesome stuff and you can't do that yet so once you get past that and i i think i'm i'm past that to a certain extent right there's still a ton of cool stuff i want to be able to do but i can't yet uh but i can do a lot so now it's it's fun you know i know okay if somebody asked me to do this thing i know i got this right now it's not a matter of can i do it it's well like how am i gonna do it how fast can i make it how nice can i make it look um what new tech can i use and learn while i'm doing this and that's just that's fun it's fun for me um and the added thing of being able to see you all in the live stream is just like this whole another level of just coolness to the to what i do that uh was is just unexpected and really amazing so um that's a really good question that made me think but i i i like that i like that question okay definitely didn't get through all the questions i'm gonna start up my pomodoro timer again and let's see cool hershey just gave me the algolia css awesome so let's go over and throw this css in our head there we go so we have our layout here and let's grab harsha put in that css but i want to just you know what i'm i'm just don't feel like actually typing out a link tag so i'm going to grab this uh let's see i think this is what horseshit does instances themes oh maybe this is different actually this is different i wonder i'm going to grab these because they're already there reset this all right we'll try the reset one first what is the difference okay all right let's they recommend using the reset so let me grab this one and we'll paste this in so we have this little head component and that lets us throw in things like link tags right so we already have this link tag of our page.css and which page.css gets used on almost everything so might not be a bad idea to just make that global i'd have to make sure okay let's see what we have now hmm okay looks like maybe didn't do anything where's my css okay that came in why did not do anything reset is basic algolia is more stylish okay so let's go with the more stylish one okay let's go back here and see let's see what the algolia one is where's my whoops gotta close that tag whoops keep going the wrong way okay all right oh yeah that's definitely uh different here okay cool so now we're getting this still like we're getting a lot of um a lot of this so we probably need to say to indicate somehow exactly what data we want to display because a lot of this is is completely irrelevant but this is pretty cool i mean this is not it's not exactly the style that we use for the for the website so i would be okay with adding it like in here with this type of styling temporarily just to get a good search in there because the functionality is important uh to get in there right away but and then maybe going back and redoing it so that it matches our material design style but this is good enough i think it could work uh definitely need to figure out oh you know what i just said at the last end of the last pomodoro session that we were gonna get all our data before we started styling and i completely forgot okay well we reversed reverse that and let's see sorry my boss just sent me a question um okay so up to this point it's been mostly me entering data and some student workers and i haven't gone through the process yet of uh really teaching anybody else how to enter data so it's a little bit crazy for me because every time some of these change like i get these questions so um all right let's check our documentation and figure out how to get uh search multiple uh indices right is that how you do it and it's not indexes right it's indices i don't know i think it's indices okay let's see if it says it um parameters hmm okay charbel says sometimes it is indexes all right let's go to the dashboard and see what it says all right algolia uses the term indices so i guess we'll just use indices for now and all right there we go multiindex why didn't i see that there we go you can use multiple index components each index component takes one prop okay all right let's check out both examples so it looks like there's there's two different ways to do it um not that one uh let's go to source and check out app okay so they have instant search and they have one index there and then underneath hits they use index oh and then results in the second database all right let's just copy and paste this and see how it looks see if this is what kind of what we're going for let's import index first and then we'll use it down here whoops down here so under hits um sorry i did my boss messaged me again so let's put in a real index name let's go to our dashboard and see um faculty i thought i had more than this oh well um could go with campus security because i i think that's all those those all have the data that they need so we'll go with that so jesus is that what it was oh it's hyphenated there we go okay all right oh okay all right so this will put them they'll be displayed but they'll just be displayed below interesting okay all right let's see we need i'm just not sure about that i mean i i just don't know about it it works but i'm not i'm not sure that that's the best thing hmm let's look at the other option so what is this react instant search multiindex it seems a lot more complicated but maybe it'll give us what we want um mad touch this says my phone is tripping i'll catch you later see ya thanks for watching all right um i'm just telling you 12 minutes okay let's try to get this other example working let's see we may need to put this yeah you know what let's just grab this whole component let's make a new component and we'll we'll do this or how about this let's just get rid of this entire search page and pop this in here and call it search no okay and react auto suggest i guess i have to do this um yarn and all right so we're getting react auto suggest and uh api keys i got to put my api key in again it's so convenient when they have that little button that copies automatically i mean it seems like something like i don't need this you know but really it's so helpful and what did we have uh wpp post faculty and then campus and let's go with news cool let's see carousel react instant search connectors hmm uh let's check out the package json from this example make sure we have everything react on react instant search i'll just suggest uh looks like we have all the packages michael was shocked that i just deleted everything all right why is this not working what the heck it should be react instant surge connectors all right let's go back to the documentation maybe you need to use the autocomplete connectors all right so let's see what it says about this let's see all right let's copy and paste this and just search for it and see what comes up okay when you want to display a widget using another library like material ui hey cool i do want to um what are connectors how to use them hmm okay when i when i first installed this i installed react instant search dom and not react instant search right let's check our package json yep okay here's we need to do let's go yarn i don't know what the command is let's try to remove let's double check and make sure i don't need this thumb thing okay cool we removed it all right also while we're at it let's remove algolia search you're going to go your search then uh we can install yarn or we could we could do yarn what is it called instant react instant search all right so as horseshit mentioned earlier the for whatever reason the instructions in the readme were out of date so we started with those instructions and then we moved over to the other ones which were newer unfortunately it was actually different packages so hopefully now things will work so let's go back and see yay all right look how beautiful this page is all right let's let's see um we want to say see if we have computer computer science nothing what is happening we expect i can't see anything why is this this box all right yeah what is going on can't read property trump undefined all right looks like some weirdness is happening finish loading posts here all right we're getting stuff right let's see who we got from here there we got these queries results faculty yeah yeah we got who is this yeah dr christina safranski she's a very nice woman talked to her last week um all right so for whatever reason we're having some issues getting this rendered but it looks like it works though it's just um it's not so we're getting the data that works that's important let's see where i've gone wrong hey maybe i'll look at the error message that that seems like a good idea okay uncle type can i read property trimble undefined auto suggest js41 it's just 77. all right let's check this out 77 ought to suggest okay you know what probably one of these props i passed in is not working right with the data that we actually have all right so those look good all right so see what these are doing it's value stage search for product placeholder section hit section index all right my timer went off let's do another break and i'm gonna scroll up and try to figure out where i left off so we can answer more questions and probably do another pomodoro session after this figure out what's going on just it feels like we're close you know just have to sort out what's going on there with all those props uh might not be a bad idea to just go to the um uh documentation and figure out what those props actually do uh massoud says i want to learn computer software coding system uh awesome well hopefully you'll be able to learn something from my my streams feel free to ask any questions what's up dude says hey you future bald guy it said blad guy but i'm assuming bald guy i hope i don't go bald but i mean it could happen am i kind of like my hair uh aditya says hey you're doing a really good great job please keep it up thank you i appreciate it divya says today i had a react redux interview i was supposed to uh to make an app which renders data from their bitcoin api and it made me so confused because i made a fetch data action with axios uh get request oh well i mean what happened did you end up being able to do it i mean how did it go uh mit plus says thank you for your awesome informative answers you're welcome thanks for watching uh hardship says are you gonna use react instant search yep actually that was probably really early on before i said i was gonna use it uh let's see phoenix says today i successfully created my blog site using gatsby it was previously plain html and javascript it's a great tool made a few uh mistakes they cost a couple of hours but i learned oh that's awesome congratulations uh how many says uh amazing progress on the website since last time i saw a great work oh thank you i appreciate it um albert asks what css library i'm using it's called material ui uh mamo'd gave me a little um winking kissy face with a heart emoji so thank you carlos says hi jesse hello everyone good to be able to watch live again haven't been able to watch live these days back awesome well i'm glad that you are able to watch live it's good to see you john says i guess i missed a bunch at the point you came in not too much i guess carlos says jesse maybe you can come to switzerland would be great that would be so awesome so all right so anybody that uh may at some point ever want to like hang out with me or get a cup of coffee or whatever um if you're ever near pittsburgh let me know because i'm not that far from pittsburgh and i would drive up there and hang out but if there's a tech conference near you let me know like in enough time that i can try to apply to speak there and then i'll go or if it's in the united states my employer would may pay for me to go so that would also be okay if it's outside the united states i doubt they'll pay for me but if i be if i was a speaker the conference would probably pay for me to go and then i'd be more than happy to come hang out uh so i try to stay up to date on the conferences but there's so many of them it's just it's hard to keep track of all of them and i really like going to conferences and meeting people and speaking let's see let's see john says nice opportunity think of me on your travels since you share your birthday with me oh really we share a birthday no way so my birthday is october 29th so uh if anybody has lots of money laying around and wants to buy me something i'll send you a link to my amazon wishlist and no i'm just i'm just messing around uh but um if you want to wish me happy birthday that'd be cool let's see i mean you don't have to right now but like in october turbo asked if i've ever been to an o'reilly conference i have not but i'm really interested in it they seem like huge like cool conferences so um definitely would be be interested in going they aren't they they're they're kind of expensive i can't i don't want to say for sure but i like vaguely remember that those conferences were a little bit more expensive than the conferences i usually go to okay my timer went off again so i'm gonna i'm just kind of scanning through to see where the next question is so i can start there next time okay 235 i'm gonna write down this question or that time stamp oh my goodness i just looked at my phone i don't think i've ever had this many notifications let me see i wonder if y'all can see that like that's all the notifications across the bottom there i so many all right i don't know what's happening it's lots of news stories and youtube notifications all right we're gonna do one more pomodoro session try to get this working if i can't get it in one more session then i'll just read the rest of the questions and we'll end it and i'll work on it later on hopefully and um i got until five so at five the university's having this this like um oktoberfest thing so we have a campus in austria in gaming and uh so they call it garming fest but it's basically like an oktoberfest thing and that's at five and my kids are coming my wife's coming so i gotta finish by then oops my boss just sent me this to show me that the title hmm okay so that is actually a big deal i don't know if you can see because it's small but there's no title tag on these pages so that's important for search engine optimization also there's no indicator that of what this page actually is so the url you can see it's the theology faculty but it'd be cool to have a title on the page which is already on my list anyway but it's it's gonna move higher up on my list now that my boss said to do it so i just told my boss that i'm gonna finish the search thing first and then i will move on to that um so i think that that will be good uh let's see where do we leave off oh the props so we're getting an error about okay so the error happened let's see if we can get a better filter render under suggestions all right just kind of wanted to check out that error message see if we can get a hint of exactly where it was render suggestion it looks like it's the suggestions part tag name um all right so let's read about this render suggestion prop first and see if we can figure it out um where are we at autocomplete that's the autocomplete component right yeah let's see if we can find that then so let's see did anything come up when i search for that connect autocomplete let's see there that does not look like what i'm looking for all right let's see what this does hmm i just want i just want to know what these props do right it's not hmm i actually named all right so it seems like let me read this error message again so it's trying to trim a property that is undefined i'm assuming then that it's that hit property that's undefined so we're passing in a string of name and a string of marks so that should be fine it should be defined the only thing that potentially could be undefined is hit so we're passing in render is it render suggestion oh that's just render suggestion period get suggestions oh you know we need to go up to suggestions fetch my suggestions clearly requested justin's value let's figure out where all this stuff is getting passed around okay so that's supposed to return hit name maybe maybe name isn't a value so i mean hit should work right but if it's trying to get name let's let's see our data let's go back to our network and see what we're getting so a result and we have hits right so each hit is going to be here so we have hits and we have name we don't right no we don't have name so what do we want to use so this is supposed to be git suggestion value now we don't really want name we want i'm assuming that name would be what's actually displayed so let's see i guess we want title post title so a1 is for this particular hit it's just going to go ahead it's in a particular head let's see if we can just do a hit dot uh post title and see if that'll work okay just kind of scanning through to see if there's anything else that we might need to change okay and there should be a title what did i call that post yeah there should be a post title for every piece of data that we pull in since we're dealing with with all posts uh i'm gonna refresh this and let's go back to the console see what we're getting window id okay that's fine um so we're gonna go see we're getting okay uh we're not getting that error anymore that's good uh we're still not displaying anything we're not displaying anything so let's let's inspect just to see if if it's just um yeah nothing's coming up ah that says post underscore title oh is that it was it did i put the wrong thing in uh good good catch on that let's double check that it's it is post underscore title awesome i'm so glad you saw that who was that uh swag swaga caught the post underscore title and that's probably our issue i'm really glad you caught that because it may have taken me forever to figure it out all right let's see if we get something now no let me refresh manually just double check and make sure okay still not let's see if we're getting any errors though okay no errors oops not on the console all right no errors which is good let's see if we can do that and yeah i was wondering if we can make an error by typing in some gibberish but still no errors so that's good okay let's see render section title let's check out where that's at render render section title all right actually that's not it we want not the section we want the suggestion hmm and let's say instead of the hit let's let's see if we can get the title to render here i'm not really sure what yeah i'm there's got to be some documentation for this that i'm missing that explains more about what what this does failed prop type string supply it's a highlighter expected okay so it does expect an object not a string so let's bring it back down the head okay oh okay that's a great idea let's log this we're gonna console log hit just to see what we're getting and that was destroyer of worlds says log the object great idea when all else fails console log to the rescue i'm just i'm going to do that to um just to clear the console all right let's see what we get whoa all right up here okay so this is what we get when we get uh hits so it should be hit dot and this post title would give us the title okay um maybe wasn't the same name before maybe it's looking for the attribute and it's going to highlight that so maybe what we need to do is say maybe it's going to use this value for the search well it's worth a try we'll figure it out in a second yes that was it okay cool yeah who needs documentation trial and error right all right cool so all right so that's that's what we need basically it will show uh whatever we put in here tag name i don't know what this tag name thing is um let's try to give it another value uh let's give it this post type value and see what happens okay so i don't know what that is it didn't do anything visually let's see if it did anything down here oh post type what's bio highlighted it's supposed to be highlighted and it's not interesting hmm let's see all right this class is supposed to be highlighting it but it looks like i don't know maybe we're missing some styles but i still can't find what happened yeah i don't know what this uh tag name is for but at least we know we can get that uh displayed which is cool okay viple says the name that you are giving to tag name is becoming the tag name um oh okay no it's not okay yeah so the the post type should be campus security but if we search that's not actually listed anywhere on the page kept here but this is not it has extra stuff there so that's not it so i'm not exactly sure what this is doing right now all right but this is this is good um this at least lets us know like what it's working we can get the data back and we can display the data on the page right so this is good news and what we'll be able to do then let's see the data we have make sure we have the the proper data okay so what we need is okay so we definitely need the title and content or i should say we don't we don't necessarily need to show the content i guess we just need to make sure that i get searched if we have an image it'll be cool to show the thumbnail image the only piece of data that we're really that we're missing that's very important is we have a special field called uh what's it called called search url and that was added with a wordpress plugin called advanced custom fields i need to create a plugin to be able uh to have algolia through the algolia wordpress plugin be able to get the data that's in advanced custom fields so i can't complete this until i do that so that's definitely going to be i mean that's a crucial step that has to be done and it would also be good to find some documentation for what what i can do with this component this uh autocompletes or is it auto suggests was i searching for the wrong thing the whole time i was hmm where is auto suggest from so hmm okay so this is why i couldn't find documentation i think this is a completely separate thing okay there we go cool look at this we got all the props right nice now we can see what this is all right so suggestion value implemented to teach auto suggests what should be the input value when suggestion is clicked okay render suggestion okay so in render suggestion we could do whatever we want all right so that's that's pretty cool um input props pass through arbitrary props to the input must sustain at least value not change okay go to everything just it's just highlighted we'll be called every time the highlighting session changes should render suggestions all these other suggestions all right there's all kind of cool stuff i'm not going to read through all this right now on the stream that will be boring for you all but this is really cool i'm gonna paste this in the live chat and that way if you all want to check that out you can but this seems really cool like uh we could definitely do a lot with it and customize let's see render suggestions okay so we're getting i wondered where we were bringing in highlight we're pulling in highlight from instant search all right so if we want to know what's going on with highlight we need to look that up in the instant search documentation there we go all right we use the mark tag to highlight this tag is specifically made for highlighting pieces of text the default tag is em mostly for legacy okay so this is the actual html tag that gets used then interesting let's see what that looks we should be able to see that now now that i know what i'm looking for yay look at that so post it's literally taking the word post type and putting it there that makes sense now so we could throw in mark and see what that looks like okay now we can see the highlighting is working that makes a lot of sense all right cool so highlight yes so this just says what we want to highlight create a custom hit widget we create a custom widget for the results oh okay interesting hmm so i wonder if we could do something like i wonder if this will work if we could do this so i started using a different keyboard at home so my typing is like all over the place i think because of this um let's see if we can get content to show up here i want to see if i can put both of them together if it'll work yes check that out nice so oops didn't mean to click on that nice let's just throw in a an ugly br in here for a second what it didn't work all right anyway that's really cool so that's awesome alright anyway my timer went off so for now i think we made a lot of good progress not ready to go live with it just yet but it came really far it's it's nice so let me go back to the chat right where i left off at i'm gonna answer all your questions okay first i need to take a drink of this gfuel because i'm tired i haven't said this in a while but if anybody from gfuel is watching uh i would definitely allow you to have the honor of me sponsoring you just if you give me some free g fuel i would shout it out on the show just a suggestion started out there or if you're a rival company 2g fuel i would be interested in switching if i could get free stuff that has caffeine in it all right i'm sorry i lost my place i'm just stalling okay here's my it's a question okay 12 35 what am i listening to i'm like distracted by this atlantis morissette song that's playing right now on my headphones i had 90s music playing it says how does it get all that data does it send a get request so we're talking about algolia does it send a gate request per letter you type to algolia which does what amounts uh to magic and then sends back a response um um let's see uh let's see what it does uh we can go let's move the console back in so we can see it at the same time what is that okay so we'll we'll keep the console here and let's see what's happening yeah it looks like we're getting data back on every on every click we can look at the network um at the xhr request and see should we go actually it's hard to see there's too many all right but i mean that's a lot of requests so i'm well yeah i'm guessing on every single time we type i have no idea how it does it that fast uh but that's that's pretty cool we can check our dashboard and see i wonder if it'll tell us like the activity 24 minutes wow yeah so in the last 20 last 24 hours we had 455 queries uh 90 of queries under 15 milliseconds wow that's cool let's see okay so there's a conversation going on a little side conversation about this all stem from birthdays and age and keto and weight loss so it's has i've seen so mad that's just saying i've seen a couple of people do the snake keto diet and drop a billion pounds quick i'm not a huge cake fan but sweet coffee is my weakness so i just brought that up because uh i i did earlier in the year i did like kind of a really strict diet and i wasn't trying to do keto but it ended up being kind of like a keto diet and i did i lost like 15 pounds uh and it it was like somewhat quickly so definitely worked but i it's funny because part of the thing that i did have to give up was like putting a lot of stuff in my coffee so i got in the habit of just drinking black coffee because it's you know almost no calories so you just drink black coffee all day caffeine's like kind of an appetite suppressant and you feel kind of full so anyway just just reminded me i'm back on a diet but it's way more relaxed at this point john hanson says uh it is fast it's going round trip to google where pista is oh actually so we're not going around trips so this may explain a little bit about why this is fast so we have a round trip not back to wordpress but what we've done is we've exported as json all of the data in wordpress and it's just sits here in you know on algolia servers or whatever so it just goes to there it grabs that data and comes back so i think that helps explain some of the speed that it doesn't have to go through wordpress through php into my sequel and then back out which uh you know that saves a lot of time see nikki says uh front end masters is free right now can't follow any lessons there now sadly but i recommend to check it out oh cool all right so everybody uh front end masters is free right now so check it out i can't i don't remember if i've ever done one of their courses or not but i've heard good things about them so if you're looking for a course um you know definitely check that out michael says earlier we were talking about how i i did get a lot of complaints i don't know about a lot but um very um intense complaints about the new website not um showing the university as being really catholic so like here's the new site um and michael says isn't the name franciscan kind of a giveaway that is catholic yeah i mean i i think there's a good argument to be made that the the university uh already has enough catholic stuff associated with it that we're not really at risk of losing that just because we uh don't explicitly talk about it on the homepage like our logo has a cross in it um we do have the name franciscan right so i mean there's uh there's something to be said for that but uh it wasn't an unreasonable suggestion that maybe we put something a little bit more overtly uh catholic you know on the website so um so since i wasn't really opposed to the idea you know i i put it there but i i mean i think based on the data that we have we we do have um a problem with the the perception that our academic programs aren't as good as academic programs from other schools okay so i don't know that that's true but that's the perception that we got back from from some uh surveys and stuff so that's what we want to try to showcase what we do have so people realize what that we have a lot of good stuff going on here academically as well char bill says ask for a quick tutorial on ngrok i don't really know much about ngrok other than it works it's a command line tool uh you just start running a server locally and then you put in you just run a command basically saying ngrok here's where my server is port 3000 you hit enter and it it gives you these urls and it does everything else so um they have free plans that are pretty limited uh incontrivable who built ngrok was extremely generous and allows us to basically have an unlimited free plan for free codecamp live streams otherwise if you want to be able to have a lot of users at the same time a lot of people accessing your url you do need to have uh you know a paid plan i think it's a monthly thing but that's pretty much it i mean in terms of like setup and what you need to do it's you know really easy there's like a few steps to set it up but once you do it like you're good it's set up forever on that computer all right i'm trying to find a question there's a lot of like back and forth talk between everybody in the live chat which is awesome but if anybody's interested you can read the the live chat when you're watching this later on but i'm not going to read it all out uh let's see uh rithik says what is the name of the software visual basic uh sorry if it sound weird but i don't know it's um visual studio code i think you're referring to the code editor visual studio code thanks that dutchess says uh there's nothing wrong with bald for guys anyway earlier somebody said that i i think they were trying to say that i was gonna go bald which may be true uh and i said i didn't want to go bald matt duchess says there's nothing wrong with bald well i thank you i appreciate it i actually used to shave my head um it was especially nice like during the summer time it's nice and cool uh you can wear a hat you don't mess up your hair like you're basically your hair never get gets messed up because you don't have any so it wouldn't be like completely weird but i like the option of having hair oh nikki says so nikki i think correct me if i'm wrong but i think you're talking about this said you had no idea at first what the this number was in the top until you saw it was a tell link as did anybody else have that impression is it obvious that this is a phone number or not if it's not obvious what could i do that would look nice that would make it more obvious that this is a phone number because i i mean i obviously knew it's a phone number because i put it in there but i don't know how it appears to other people so let let me know um do you think this is obvious enough or not if not what should i do uh julio says try this cool new extension for live sessions vs live stream vs code that's that is really awesome i've heard of that i haven't had a chance to use it yet but i i would love to um to use it at some point eva says you should bind your class methods or use arrow functions uh like methods of class um yeah i wonder at that point in the stream i wonder if i had already i was copying and pasting a lot of code so that may have been stuff i copy and paste it in um if not if it was stuff i had already coded then let me know because i if i can improve it i definitely want to so anyway thank you for mentioning that ava let's see dextre of world says are you using sass or style components uh no we're using what are we we're using a variety of we're not using either one of those we're using like plain css inline css i don't even know what's it called css and js is that what's called when we do the um css as a javascript object so we have a variety of methods unfortunately i don't have sas uh set up so but i normally do prefer to use sas i've used style components a little bit before in another project and i think i i think they would be cool if i knew more about them but i'm not comfortable enough with them yet to really be good with them nikki says was that atlantis morrissette song called ironic cause it's like rain incomprehensible gibberish no it wasn't ironic what was the one what's it called let me check it was uh you oughta know that was what it was called it's actually kind of like hardcore atlantis moreso was pretty hardcore back in the day that was from the jagged little pill album john hanson says i'm doing keto drop 20 pounds awesome congratulations i said i also do intermittent fasting no more afternoon energy crash and better focus than ever workouts are much better too that's awesome that's that's really cool uh codaly says hi there hey how's it going carlos says having been a university psychology professor for 11 years i don't think that overtly showing that the university of catholic is a is a plus um yeah this university is a little bit like um so there's like a small niche of uh universities that attract like um let's say like very devout catholic students and families uh so franciscan university is is one of those one of the leading universities that does that so um the families that send their their kids here kids that come here like basically are looking for a place where um they won't feel like an outsider for being a devout catholic you know um so it is kind of it it is a plus for what we for our target audience so uh and that was what some of the students and some of the professors were worried about was like are we dropping that you know or are we trying to attract you know different students now are we trying so i mean that really it wasn't what we were doing at all in fact we were just unfortunately what we have happened sometimes is a student will really want to come here you know because of the reputation that this is a good place where you can come you don't have to worry about a lot of bad stuff going on but they didn't feel like they get a good academic education in whatever particular field they wanted to go into so they went somewhere else so our attempt the idea was okay well let's let those students know that we also have good academics right so carlos i think you're right for for a large majority of of people out there you know they they would either could care less about the to university being catholic or it might be a negative thing but like i said we have a kind of a unique niche that we're in right now uh carlos says i would go with what you would research or do a blind test showing clickthrough rate with the catholic symbol or without it and see which gives you better clickthrough rate for action actually i do i really want to do um some some tests on different like different images and different things we do and measure clickthrough rates so that's going to be something that i hope to get set up soon so that we can really measure those things so that when people come to me with with ideas or criticisms or complaints i can have this data to show like you know i can see why you feel that way but that's not really what's happening you know and show them i mean also i'd like to know what works you know maybe i'm mistaken maybe they're right you know so i do really want to have that data that's a great idea oh okay um i had asked about the phone number and um several of you are saying put a phone icon in front of it that is a great idea that's a great idea i'm gonna add that to my trello board right now so i got let me bring over my trello board just so y'all can see what i what i have going on here in case you haven't seen it before so like this is the algolia search thing and we put it we just put in three pomodoro sessions so i'm gonna up this to six to say that i've already done six sessions i estimate it would take five but actually this card was just for research so i guess i should do another card for implementation but anyway uh the research part only took me like one pomodoro session before i figured out i definitely want to use this but let's say add okay and i'm gonna it says add phone number add phone icon in front of that bar phone number i'm gonna estimate that that's gonna take me one pomodoro session and then i am going to assign that to myself there we go all right okay okay nikki says i'm not familiar with that format for the telephone number you know what actually this is not really a common format in the united states i just like it for style reasons so i i think that's you're you're not alone and being unfamiliar with that format i think a lot of people might be and i just didn't i didn't even think about it so normally there would be hyphens and maybe even uh you know parentheses so i think i like the the periods but i i agree that's probably confusing so i think i'm going to go with the icon i'm going to keep the periods but i'm going to go with the phone icon that makes it really obvious all right uh swagga says uh nikki that's how most tollfree numbers look minus the periods in between yeah yeah i mean that's yeah the periods are um uh not not really common i don't really know where i picked that up from but i saw it on a site before and i thought that looks that was kind of cool gerald perez says what are you doing um well we're just kind of finishing up doing some question and answer we did some coding earlier um morrow says that okay so a lot of you say add phone icon i appreciate the feedback from you all i think that's a great idea um it looks like gerald is not a fan of uh atlantis uh elena's morris said so i'm telling her early stuff i think is is pretty good i i think it's better her i'm not a huge fan of her later stuff but she was really edgy at first and it was i liked it um nikki says uh the devout catholics seeing the site will immediately link franciscan with well saint francis so it's not needed in my opinion but i get the point i nikki that is a great point like i like i said i'm not going to make a big deal about it or argue because i mean at the end of the day i want to code i want to make things right that are performant and look nice right so content is not even exactly my thing um and unless it starts affecting performance or like really messing up the look of the site and then i want to get involved uh but i i think you are right i think it's an overreaction on the part of the people that were saying it is that uh you know the the people you're right the people who are devout catholics will know that that franciscan university is a catholic school right and they will will understand the reputation and um there's a ton of other information on the rest of the website in our social media on our youtube that will definitely explain that so yeah i think um having i mean what images do you end up having like this one right with the students praying right images like that i think will help to to you know calm you know so people can just calm down and realize like you know we're not we're not trying to take away anything um so you know i think that'll be good you know but at the same time it is it is kind of odd to see that as like hey i'm looking for university so i can get a degree so i can get a job and this is your image here so it's just like um you know it's it's an interesting thing right there there are several um like schools of thought here on campus about like who we are as a university and um i think there's a a good group of people that realize that we're we're a mix of different things right there's all kind of reasons that people come here but then there's some very opposite groups that say like we need to focus on um academics right academics is the main thing and there are other people saying like no we need to focus on on uh our faith and like that's why people want to come here and so yeah there's a huge difference and then even within the academics it's like some people say well we we don't care about making people job ready we're going to learn for the sake of learning you know and there are other people that are saying no like we need we need to have programs that will enable students to like provide for their families and get jobs and things so there's there's just a whole lot of discussion uh so um you know it and something as visible as the front page of the main website becomes the focus of discussion you know because everybody sees it so anyway uh we actually did have data that showed that students really responded positively to like aerial like drone footage and stuff so that's why we threw this in here um carlos says you guys need to do market research for those things yeah that's the thing like we have market research but number one like it's just not not everybody has seen the research right it's not like we publish it everywhere um although there's no reason why we couldn't so not everybody's seen the research and even when people do see them see the research people want to like think how they want to think right it's hard to convince them otherwise so if they already have this opinion that they hold strongly even when you show them the research they come up with all these reasons why it doesn't matter right so um when i'm gonna make when i make decisions i really try to follow the research that way i always have that to fall back on it's like this is not my opinion or at least it's as little about my opinion as i can make it uh and it's more about the numbers it's more about what we see from the research so uh when i was doing redoing this page for the last time i had a pdf of the market research open at the same time and was looking at it all and saying okay this is what we want i also had like the most visited pages on the website from analytics over the past year up saying like this is what people are clicking on so um anyway so i'm with you right there like carlos i'm i'm totally on board with that i think that's the way we need to go uh we need to get data on everything and we need to actually do things based on that data that's not exactly what how things have been done in the past uh here so it just takes a while for people to switch over and and learn to trust the data and not you know their intuition about about things so uh you know it's just gonna take not everybody's gonna gonna change some people are really excited about the change and they're like yes finally other people you know they they resist it so we'll see how it goes i mean my department is pretty far ahead when it comes to this kind of stuff i've been here three years and since day one i've been trying to get data and make decisions based on data so we've come a long way from where we were uh and hopefully it'll get better but anyway i'm getting far afield from actual coding here uh anyway my department is marketing by the way so i'm not like in it or anything like that i'm in marketing so market research and as much data as we can get from that from our interrelate analytics is very important to us uh let's see oh wow i've been streaming for over two hours now okay so it looks like i've gotten through all the questions thank you all so much for uh for watching and uh for all the help uh there's definitely like several times in the stream where i would have been stuck and i you all y'all helped me out so i appreciate uh you watching and appreciate all the the kind comments uh that you all had today uh man on social media and yeah don't forget to i'm active mostly on twitter and on instagram but you know check check it out like if you're interested i do put some content up on on both of those platforms i also have my own youtube channel you can i think there's a link in the description this video i haven't done anything on there for a while but i really would like to i have some tutorial videos and things like that so if you if you like what i'm doing here and you want to see more of it you can check that out um let's see yeah i think that's it for me so once again thank you so much and have a great weekend i should be back with another stream on monday
