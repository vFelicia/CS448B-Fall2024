00:02 - hey everybody is Jessie and welcome to
00:05 - live coding with Jessie today we're
00:07 - gonna continue on with what we were
00:09 - doing yesterday which was making a
00:12 - homepage using material design so we got
00:19 - our our buttons sorted out yesterday I
00:25 - think we got our bunch sorted out I just
00:30 - looked at it on my other screen here and
00:33 - they don't look right anymore
00:35 - he'll be on all right I'm on a different
00:38 - branch alright so I have my node member
00:48 - hat on today so you kind of see the node
00:53 - member on there so it's cold and today
00:57 - we get to dress down and my coworkers
01:02 - are trying to peek in on the last string
01:04 - we got to dress down today so I got to
01:06 - wear normally I have to wear dress
01:08 - clothes but I got to wear jeans my
01:10 - November hoodie so I haven't gotten to
01:15 - show off any of this gear on the stream
01:17 - so I figured I would today rights
01:30 - all right so let's get started
01:34 - I let me switch to y'all can see the
01:38 - screen okay so yesterday we got these
01:48 - buttons in here and they will keep this
01:51 - configuration no matter what the screen
01:53 - sizes and their narrow enough that they
02:00 - will fit on small screens even on the
02:05 - narrowest of phones the only thing I was
02:09 - thinking of with this and I'm not
02:11 - worrying about it right now cuz we're
02:12 - just gonna try to lay out a potential
02:15 - you know homepage to show my boss
02:19 - we might actually they have more than
02:21 - one will just I will probably just do it
02:24 - on different branches but I'm thinking
02:29 - maybe on a larger screen these buttons
02:31 - could be larger and then we'll use some
02:33 - media queries to scale them down on
02:35 - small screens we also put in this events
02:41 - section within this card and right now
02:45 - you know it's really basic I think this
02:47 - is enough just to kind of get the
02:49 - concept that we could put a list here it
02:51 - could be events it could be news
02:52 - whatever we wanted to put there now I'd
02:55 - like to fill in this using kind of like
02:59 - a masonry grid style and just throw in
03:04 - some different types of content just
03:07 - maybe some stock photos some areas for
03:10 - text some areas for video just so we
03:14 - have a nice visual what could happen
03:16 - with this homepage and I don't think
03:20 - we'll get this done today but if we do
03:21 - get that done today then maybe we'll
03:23 - move on and I'd like to do maybe a more
03:25 - traditional homepage that would be kind
03:28 - of linear and tell a story so you know
03:31 - would you'd still the hope here a
03:33 - section would be the same but then you
03:36 - may have just some full width sections
03:38 - that would explain what's so great about
03:40 - Franciscan University why would you want
03:43 - to come
03:43 - and finish up with another
03:44 - call-to-action at the bottom I think
03:48 - those will be two good points to start
03:51 - from and then I think we can get some
03:54 - feedback and you know we rework it
03:58 - we'll probably come back to this page
04:00 - several times over the next month or so
04:02 - and work on some interior pages as well
04:05 - but we'll go through a couple cycles of
04:08 - you know trying some stuff out getting
04:10 - feedback and then making some
04:12 - adjustments getting more feedback so
04:17 - enough talk let's start out this
04:20 - Pomodoro timer and I started doing some
04:23 - code now if you're not familiar with
04:26 - Pomodoro timer this is a way to break up
04:28 - your work and I like to use it when I'm
04:33 - working throughout the day but it's also
04:36 - nice on the stream because it reminds me
04:38 - to quit coding and check out the live
04:39 - chat and answer any questions that there
04:42 - may be in there so that's what I'm gonna
04:44 - do if you ask a question in the live
04:46 - chat during the 25 minute session please
04:48 - be patient and I will get to your
04:49 - question whenever the 25 minute period
04:54 - is over we'll do a break answer some
04:56 - questions do another 25 minute session
04:58 - so I'm hoping to do two coding sessions
05:00 - today let's start the first one
05:04 - all right so yep this is our our code
05:10 - and right now we're using react and
05:15 - we're using next js' to kind of scaffold
05:19 - out our react app next j/s offers a
05:23 - server-side rendering without very much
05:26 - work on our part and then it offers us a
05:28 - routing system built in so anything in
05:32 - this pages folder will become its own
05:35 - route so the home page is indexed j/s
05:38 - but then the other pages are just you
05:41 - know what their names are here so we
05:42 - have we have a page called page we have
05:44 - a page called faculty all right so we're
05:48 - going to be working on just on the home
05:49 - page today so we're gonna scroll down
05:55 - normally you wouldn't want to
05:57 - hard-code things in your component like
05:58 - this this end is going to end up being a
06:00 - really big component once we're done
06:02 - with it but then what we'll do is once
06:05 - we're set on a design we'll go back and
06:09 - we'll actually break these down into
06:12 - other components and have it populated
06:17 - with data you know from an a database
06:20 - we'll pull it in with a graph QL API and
06:23 - then that way these will get a lot
06:25 - smaller
06:26 - we won't clutter them up with you know
06:28 - with a lot of you know text content
06:31 - right here in the component okay so I'd
06:35 - like to add let's see I think I'd like
06:40 - to break up this section here and two
06:46 - maybe two cars let's see how this looks
06:53 - breaking this up into two cards I don't
06:55 - want it to be too too small but at least
07:04 - on a large screen I think I would it
07:07 - would be okay to have it like that so
07:11 - let's try that first
07:16 - see
07:21 - all right so here's that first card and
07:24 - just has an image at the top so what
07:29 - we'll do is we'll just copy this now
07:33 - we're using material UI for a lot of our
07:38 - components because it uses that Google's
07:41 - material design if you're not familiar
07:43 - with react just think about using the
07:45 - bootstrap for a regular site material UI
07:50 - plays the same role for a react app as
07:53 - bootstrap plays for just a normal you
07:56 - know HTML site but in in this case it's
08:01 - following material design and this we
08:07 - need to make this alright that's good
08:12 - and then let's change these values so
08:14 - instead of we have a 12 column grid so
08:17 - if you give it a value of 12 that means
08:20 - it's full width if you give it a value
08:22 - of 6 that means it takes a path the
08:24 - width of the screen so we want it to
08:26 - take up 1/4 so we're gonna put in 3 so
08:31 - that each one of these takes up only 3
08:33 - columns let's say that see what we get
08:38 - alright great so now we've lit this up
08:41 - into two cards on let's see what screen
08:46 - size we can get I'm gonna shrink this
08:50 - down just to get a more realistic screen
08:55 - size the screen that I have on right now
08:58 - that you can see is is pretty large 20
09:01 - it's over 20 inches I don't remember how
09:04 - how much over 20 inches it is and it's
09:08 - also a 2k screen so it's not not
09:12 - everybody's gonna have a screen like
09:14 - this ok not bad I think we can
09:23 - definitely fit some content in here and
09:25 - it won't look you know too small
09:32 - let's see so I just checking out the
09:40 - live chat a bit hey everybody
09:45 - alright so let's throw in some text
09:48 - content in here and I don't have to
09:52 - think about what I want to put in here
09:57 - so let's remove this media and you know
10:07 - let's remove this card actions so I
10:11 - think what happen is when we originally
10:14 - put this in here
10:15 - I think the card content would have been
10:22 - the proper thing to use but it was
10:25 - overlaying over top of the image or
10:27 - something was happening so that's why we
10:29 - ended up born with this card actions
10:30 - normally you would actually have you
10:32 - know clickable actions in here so let's
10:35 - get rid of some of this yeah this just
10:41 - get rid of that and let's put in I
10:44 - believe it's card Connie has card
10:47 - content so if you're not familiar with
10:53 - what's going on here these components
10:57 - that we're using they don't come
10:58 - built-in with react these come from the
11:00 - material UI component library so we have
11:04 - to bring in material which we just added
11:08 - it through node package manager and
11:10 - we've import these components up the top
11:14 - you see we're bringing in these
11:16 - components for material UI and
11:31 - and I am using Visual Studio code as my
11:35 - editor if you've seen in previous videos
11:37 - you know that I I've used atom before so
11:41 - I'm still getting used to what I have
11:42 - here I was expecting a auto-complete for
11:46 - this for this tag I thought it would
11:50 - make the closing tag automatically but
11:51 - it didn't so to check my settings but a
11:57 - bit of the card content and then we'll
11:59 - want to do a typography typography tag
12:04 - and let's go with type and give it a
12:16 - type of let's give it a type of h3 just
12:25 - see what size it is
12:33 - and let's just say it's a 99% graduates
12:51 - I was super awesome alright so that is
13:03 - definitely going to draw students in
13:05 - let's see how that looks
13:08 - wow that's really small I can't believe
13:14 - h3 is that small maybe that's not even a
13:16 - real type
13:30 - I guess we'll try an h2 and see I hate
13:34 - to use age tags
13:35 - unless they're actually headings hmm
13:41 - all right something's wrong let's look
13:49 - up typography in the material UI
13:52 - documentation may be under style yep
13:58 - typography okay if you want to follow
14:02 - along and check out the documentation be
14:04 - sure to get the documentation for the
14:06 - latest version so for the beta version
14:08 - so the URL is material - UI - next calm
14:28 - - okay
14:33 - check out the API hmm
14:44 - okay you can't put an H you could put in
14:48 - display that's weird
14:53 - for some reason I thought you could put
14:56 - in a stag's maybe my memory is just
14:59 - terrible or maybe this changed at some
15:01 - point all right well now we definitely
15:04 - need to switch things up a bit so let's
15:11 - see what we want
15:11 - let's try display two
15:22 - there we go all right not bad just to
15:24 - show and we're gonna have to be
15:42 - hmm
15:47 - here's where we're gonna have to be
15:49 - careful and we'll be able to see it when
15:52 - I add some more cards in but I want to
15:56 - make sure that these gaps get filled in
15:58 - so we wouldn't have the next row all
16:01 - starting here and then a big gap here
16:04 - and I also don't want this card just to
16:08 - fill up the space and have a lot of
16:10 - white space here so let's see what
16:15 - happens when we do this with this
16:17 - current grid system we're using if we
16:20 - don't get what we want we're gonna have
16:23 - to try something different but I do have
16:24 - some ideas so I think I have at least
16:29 - two ideas one of them I know has worked
16:31 - for me before on previous sites so we'll
16:36 - try them up okay and I know that I see
16:43 - there's some questions in the live chat
16:44 - I'm gonna go over all the questions in
16:46 - about 13 minutes so whenever this timer
16:49 - is is done I'm gonna get all the
16:53 - questions so just please be patient and
16:56 - I'll do my best to answer everything all
16:59 - right so let's just add in some more
17:01 - cards I really want to see how these
17:02 - stack and the easiest way to do this is
17:08 - just going to be to throw in some more
17:13 - items so first thing I'm going to try to
17:18 - do is still like this within the same
17:25 - container I'm not sure exactly if this
17:32 - will work or novelist's try it out
17:35 - okay so doing it this way you see we
17:38 - have the problem that I thought we would
17:40 - have let's go to the documentation and
17:44 - see if there's already a built-in way to
17:45 - solve this
17:52 - okay I'm sorry I just glanced there
17:58 - michael says can't follow along as usual
18:00 - at the hospital getting my bi-weekly
18:02 - phlebotomy for a blood issue I hope
18:06 - everything's okay with your your health
18:09 - issues Michael so I didn't realize that
18:12 - you had that so I hope it's not really
18:16 - serious always like talking with you
18:20 - here on the live chat so anyway if doing
18:27 - the stream at this time conflicts
18:29 - regularly with your appointments let me
18:31 - know and maybe eggs try to do it a
18:33 - different time because I'd hate for you
18:35 - to have to miss okay where we at
18:44 - grid area
18:47 - okay so we're we're checking out the
18:50 - grid here online content interface
18:57 - between his face around
19:02 - the foolish
19:19 - well alright let's check out the demos
19:28 - I don't not worry about that
19:54 - all right I don't think there's anything
19:56 - covering that
20:08 - stretch centers my staff listens
20:18 - I'm a maybe align content or align items
20:21 - would work but I don't know I'm I'm a
20:31 - little skeptical that this would do
20:33 - anything all right so I'm gonna go to my
20:38 - next options right so I have two ideas
20:43 - one idea we've used before previous
20:45 - projects and that's to bring in masonry
20:50 - layout package that'll handle all this
20:53 - for us and we'll position things using
20:56 - javascript I'd rather not do that if we
20:59 - don't have to but we might have to my
21:03 - other idea and we saw this yesterday
21:08 - briefly it just kind of caught my eye so
21:10 - I thought why not try is to use or is it
21:15 - I don't remember what it was called so
21:17 - I'm I have to go through this list
21:20 - it was a great list you know what I
21:24 - don't want to go through the API I want
21:25 - the demos component demos
21:35 - I think this was it I think it was the
21:37 - grid list
21:44 - let me see if this is actually giving us
21:46 - what we want you know it's so far I'm
21:49 - just seeing I'm seeing everything in the
21:53 - same height in each row so the still
21:56 - isn't really solving the issue
22:08 - so let me check
22:17 - and check the source
22:23 - okay there they're mapping over this
22:27 - [Music]
22:44 - all right so I'm going to
22:57 - I'm gonna adjust the height okay yeah
23:02 - this is pretty much what I thought
23:06 - let's adjust see if there's anything
23:08 - happens
23:15 - yeah so this isn't gonna help us either
23:17 - we still have these gaps okay I don't
23:23 - think there's anything built-in to
23:26 - material UI I'm going to go through this
23:29 - list quickly just to see if there's
23:31 - something that maybe I'm missing here
23:37 - yeah I'm I'm not seeing anything okay so
23:48 - we're still gonna be able to use the
23:52 - grid the grid elements most likely but
23:58 - we're gonna add in package it's going to
24:01 - use a little bit of JavaScript to
24:03 - position each one of these cards and the
24:07 - position will update if the screen width
24:10 - changes and that way we're always going
24:17 - to have we're going to make use of all
24:20 - our space we're not gonna have these big
24:22 - gaps trying to think where did we use
24:26 - this we did use this on on the project
24:37 - actually let me let me see if it bullets
24:56 - I don't know if I actually made this
24:57 - site now I didn't I think I just have
25:03 - the site locally I don't I don't have a
25:05 - live version of it but we did this on
25:08 - the bulletin site so that'll probably be
25:12 - the best thing to look at to figure out
25:17 - how we're gonna do this so let's check
25:20 - out github and I'll make my font size a
25:29 - bit bigger wow I just got a bunch of
25:35 - emails my work email alright it looks
25:38 - like nothing is important here we go
25:46 - bulletin react so I'm going to that FUS
25:49 - mark home bulletin react repository and
25:53 - let's check out a source and it's our
26:03 - views
26:09 - probably homework it's been a while
26:17 - since I've looked at this repo grid
26:20 - renderer okay so you got to find rid
26:24 - renderer
26:30 - cojones
26:35 - there we go let's open up grid view and
26:39 - list our grid render and grid view to
26:42 - try to see what's going on and let's see
26:51 - okay
26:58 - all right I see it looks like what we
27:00 - had done here was we imported some CSS
27:06 - from another library so not material UI
27:09 - I think we imported some of the :
27:12 - classes from materialized CSS which is
27:17 - basically just like bootstrap accepted
27:20 - as material design styles so I'd rather
27:25 - not import this if we don't have to
27:28 - certainly not gonna import the whole
27:31 - thing I mean I maybe would pull little
27:34 - pieces of it if we need it but it seems
27:38 - like yeah this is something we could
27:43 - definitely do alright and let me check
27:51 - this one out as well
27:53 - grid renderer okay this is just
28:01 - switching us between the different views
28:04 - so we have in this particular project we
28:06 - had a toggle well actually is more than
28:09 - at all you could you could toggle grid
28:10 - view or list view but then you could
28:12 - also go to a print view if you wanted to
28:14 - it's not going to be that complicated
28:16 - for us we're gonna have one view I mean
28:21 - we could certainly have more than one if
28:22 - we wanted but let's just start off with
28:24 - one okay I'm gonna pull this over onto
28:29 - my other screen to make it easier for me
28:32 - to reference it and then let's pull up
28:37 - our code on this screen and let's make
28:46 - sure let's double check that this repo
28:51 - that we are using is up-to-date react
28:56 - react nation tree component check to
29:00 - make sure it's up to date they haven't
29:02 - had any braking changes or anything that
29:04 - we need to be aware of so we can go to
29:07 - the releases and see their last release
29:09 - was up
29:11 - 20 second let me think I think that we
29:17 - we worked on this project the bulletin
29:20 - project around or after that time so
29:23 - there shouldn't be changes we could
29:25 - always verify by looking at the
29:27 - package.json and our project so we'll
29:31 - bring back that repo here check out the
29:33 - package.json and see react nation
29:38 - component six-point 0.1 yeah so we'll
29:42 - have the same versions which is good so
29:44 - we won't we should be able to do this
29:45 - the same way and a reward and yep that
29:54 - makes me components all right so my
29:57 - timer is about up I'd say the last thing
30:00 - we could do is yarn add react masonry
30:10 - components and we'll let that install
30:14 - while I go back to the live chat I'm
30:18 - going to take a short break and scroll
30:22 - up and try to answer all your questions
30:41 - all right Dimitri yes where I got the
30:46 - the grid where I import the grid from
30:49 - its hero UI so let's check that out
30:51 - where you import so I had to do like an
30:55 - NPM install of material UI so I have
31:01 - already done it so I'm not going to do
31:02 - it again but you if you're using NPM I
31:07 - think what would be NPM it's it install
31:14 - save so how you do it it's been so long
31:19 - since I just used NPM but co UI or what
31:25 - I usually do is I use yarn so I do the
31:29 - yarn add material UI that will bring
31:36 - that into your project and then you can
31:38 - do the imports and you can use material
31:42 - UI so check out the material UI github
31:45 - repo or their website and it'll walk you
31:47 - through how to import that into your
31:49 - project and use it and this is for react
31:55 - only that you want to use those
31:57 - components so if you're not doing a
31:58 - react project that's this is not what
32:01 - you want to use if you'd like to use
32:03 - material design and a non react project
32:05 - try out materialized CSS and I think
32:09 - that's I think it's materialized calm
32:12 - and mature as a materialized CSS calm
32:14 - it's worth looking up
32:16 - yeah materialized CSS calm that's what
32:22 - you want to use for you know like a non
32:24 - reacts ight you know plain HTML site
32:27 - it's basically any site that you
32:29 - normally want to use bootstrap for you
32:31 - can replace bootstrap with materialise
32:33 - and it'll give you the same stuff just
32:35 - in material design style
32:46 - Patrick's is one percent of graduates
32:49 - are super lame yeah I didn't really
32:53 - think that one through but I guess that
32:55 - that's they could just be regular
32:57 - awesome they don't have to be lame so
32:59 - it's 99% of graduates are super awesome
33:03 - and yeah let's change that up right now
33:10 - because I could see that could be
33:12 - problematic
33:29 - how's that see then there's no negative
33:34 - connotation everybody's some type of
33:36 - awesome the hopeless Brit says might be
33:43 - a silly question but do web developers
33:45 - working in offices have an open mind
33:47 - about people who think out loud when
33:49 - programming
33:50 - I guess it shouldn't matter if people
33:53 - have earphones in I actually can hear it
33:57 - so I have my own office so I don't have
34:01 - other people working right next to me so
34:03 - it's not really a problem but I can hear
34:05 - the person in the office next to me I
34:07 - can hear them on the other side of my
34:08 - wall talking sometimes but only if I
34:12 - don't have my headphones on so you're
34:14 - right I wear headphones all the time
34:16 - when I'm working I always have music
34:17 - going so noise doesn't bother me if I
34:21 - happen to not have headphones on for
34:23 - some reason I can hear noise it's
34:26 - usually not a problem for me there's a
34:29 - classroom right on this side of my
34:32 - office and I can hear the professor's
34:35 - lecturing in their classroom depending
34:39 - on who the professor is I can hear them
34:41 - and that can be somewhat distracting if
34:46 - I don't have my headphones on but I
34:51 - would say I mean if if you're the type
34:55 - of person that needs to talk things out
34:57 - out loud then if you can at all like
35:00 - stay away from the other people you know
35:02 - get a little bit farther away from that
35:04 - probably best just to be respectful I
35:09 - guess you can't make them wear
35:11 - headphones so huh I don't know how I'd
35:15 - handle that luckily I don't have to deal
35:16 - with that I'm not sure how I would
35:18 - handle that one yeah it doesn't bother
35:20 - me personally because I can always wear
35:23 - the headphones
35:34 - I'm gonna go back to the coding here in
35:38 - just a second
35:39 - I wanted to make sure I made a note of
35:43 - where I'm leaving off 19 okay so the
35:52 - last comment that I got to a live chat
35:53 - is from a beam of sis I don't know how
35:58 - but I'm in love with material design all
36:00 - right well this is this is the stream
36:03 - for you because we material design
36:05 - everything here all right so the rest of
36:10 - the questions I'm going to get to after
36:12 - this next coding session if you can't
36:17 - stick around to hear the answer then
36:18 - check out the recording of this stream
36:20 - later on when you have a chance and I'll
36:23 - answer all the questions towards the end
36:25 - of the the stream
36:37 - all right what were you doing okay I
36:41 - just installed the masonry layout great
36:45 - so let's bring in masonry and like I
36:53 - mentioned at the beginning the stream
36:55 - but I think it's worth mentioning again
36:56 - I wouldn't keep this component as it is
37:00 - now in this state I would definitely
37:03 - refactor this and remove as much of this
37:08 - as I could into separate components so
37:11 - just for now when we're messing around I
37:13 - don't think it's worth it to make all
37:15 - these different components because we
37:18 - may not even keep half of them you know
37:20 - for the finished product but eventually
37:22 - this will need to be refactored
37:24 - it would just be a mess to come in here
37:26 - and try to figure out what's going on if
37:28 - we left it like this also we are going
37:31 - to be able to reuse a lot of these
37:33 - components and other places in the site
37:35 - so right we can't reuse them if they
37:37 - only exist in here all right so we got
37:42 - masonry in here now now let's try to do
37:46 - something with it so let's wrap that was
37:51 - a really hard piece out I just made
37:53 - those weird
37:55 - let's wrap our components in this
38:01 - masonry hmm let's see what happens if I
38:08 - change this grid to masonry
38:17 - I'm not really expecting this to work
38:19 - but if it does it'll be pretty awesome
38:21 - and quick so it's always worth a shot
38:32 - then I wrap the wrong thing in here I
38:35 - did all right let's try it again
38:40 - I didn't mean to wrap that part and it
38:42 - this is what I wanted to wrap in in
38:47 - masonry and I need to get rid of
38:51 - container and all the way down here
39:01 - Mason
39:08 - all right well that's something right
39:13 - let's see probably let's see
39:35 - i flex
39:50 - Thanks
40:08 - I think our we're gonna we're not going
40:11 - to be able to use grid okay just rook
40:17 - just says in the live chat that for the
40:21 - new newest versions of NPM you don't
40:24 - need to use the save flag anymore you
40:26 - can just NPM I and then the package name
40:30 - alright cool that's that's a lot shorter
40:32 - so I mean I mentioned earlier a much
40:37 - longer way to do it it's unnecessary so
40:39 - you could just do NPM I and then with
40:44 - your UI or whatever package you have
40:45 - thanks for that rook I'm behind the
40:48 - times on on NPM that is much easier all
40:53 - right so let's change these let's change
40:58 - all this grid stuff because the the CSS
41:10 - that's going along with all this these
41:12 - grid components is conflicting with what
41:15 - we're trying to do in masonry so let's
41:18 - for now just change these all to divs
41:31 - all right so they're all going to be
41:33 - divs I don't think it's going to work
41:35 - we're gonna have to add some other
41:36 - classes to that all right let's
41:50 - all right so for everything where we
41:53 - have the three let's just say hmm now I
42:03 - understand why we added in the
42:05 - materialized classes last time I'd hoped
42:10 - we wouldn't need to do that but we
42:14 - probably will so let's go with style
42:22 - with 25% we have a 25% with for that one
42:39 - and then for the ones that are six
42:52 - oh why don't we have another six yeah
42:59 - three three six we should have another
43:02 - six do we not add another one I guess we
43:11 - didn't okay so only have one that's
43:14 - small six and for this one we're going
43:19 - to change it to be 50% we're not going
43:27 - to keep things like this this is just to
43:29 - test it out if this works we'll change
43:32 - these into classes so just to test we're
43:38 - kind of making our own little grid
43:40 - system here our little column system I
43:44 - said probably won't stay like this once
43:49 - mmm let me see what the styles aren't
43:53 - here
44:31 - I gotta be missing something
44:50 - okay
45:13 - I'm checking out how we implemented this
45:16 - in the previous project just to see if
45:20 - I'm missing something
46:00 - hmm
46:02 - I think we're missing anything let's see
46:09 - we had our masonry layout up didn't we
46:22 - their react nation tree component let's
46:25 - take a look at their documentation
46:32 - just look at that basic usage mystery
46:39 - options
47:26 - you
47:45 - let me check I think we're using the
47:48 - Maestri component right I think the
47:50 - problem is our containers
48:08 - this a little bit better let's try this
48:14 - so we we had a display flex on our hero
48:19 - cards which this is not really a great
48:26 - name for these now at one time they were
48:29 - gonna peak up into the hero section
48:32 - let's try to use this without display
48:35 - there we go
48:36 - all right better much better there we go
48:39 - okay all right so you can see how this
48:42 - is supposed to work obviously we need to
48:44 - set our our gutter right our space
48:47 - between which we haven't done but aside
48:53 - from the awkwardness of that you can see
48:56 - we're not wasting space right if we had
49:00 - more cards you would see it would really
49:01 - not be wasting a lot of space we we
49:04 - didn't add in anything for smaller
49:05 - strains but this would of course
49:07 - everything would go full width and for a
49:09 - smaller screen but this is what I wanted
49:14 - this kind of fluid grid system that
49:18 - automatically adjusts it doesn't take up
49:21 - space all right
49:22 - not bad would rather not have have to do
49:28 - this in a totally different way let me
49:34 - think
49:36 - just wondering if I could read implement
49:40 - our grid and just adjust the CSS for the
49:44 - container and if that would work
49:51 - I think it's worth a shot it's not like
49:53 - I did that much work that it would be
49:55 - hard to to get it back so I'm just gonna
49:59 - hit the back button a bit bring our grid
50:04 - back and then take these out see what
50:15 - happens
50:21 - okay not not super terrible actually so
50:29 - if we can just figure out what's making
50:31 - this so thin we might be able to
50:36 - continue to use our grid which is nice
50:38 - that means we don't have to come up with
50:39 - our own our own system our own column
50:43 - system or we don't have to import it
50:45 - from materialize all right so let's
50:49 - check out this is the container div and
50:53 - I can bring dev tools over for this so
50:57 - we're checking out that container div
50:58 - that definitely needs to be bigger or
51:00 - else you all can't see it let's switch
51:08 - this around a bit to move this over and
51:13 - stretch this out there we go alright so
51:22 - this is a container you can see it's
51:25 - getting this position:absolute the exact
51:30 - positioning from the JavaScript which is
51:34 - what we wanted let's see I'm gonna go
51:40 - through
51:47 - so removing that doesn't really do
51:49 - anything let's see there's anything in
51:56 - here that looks like it might mess
51:58 - things up no nothing there just
52:01 - double-check yeah if we took out
52:07 - everything we needed there okay
52:22 - okay so if we switch from using having
52:27 - it say max with 25% and instead have
52:31 - with 25% then that works a lot better
52:44 - mmm
52:50 - so I guess now the question is is it
52:53 - worth it to go in and switch these
52:55 - classes up or should we bring in our own
53:02 - system so much time we have before we
53:08 - tackle at eight minutes let's we don't
53:19 - really have to change anything in here
53:22 - we just need to add with
53:36 - oh okay John Hansen I just saw your
53:39 - comment about the image with that makes
53:41 - sense so notice this was only happening
53:44 - on images so let's take this back to max
53:50 - with so the text was fine the events are
53:58 - the events are okay they do look
54:00 - different than they did before but this
54:02 - actually isn't yeah let's see if we can
54:09 - do this so we want the interior of not
54:13 - of that one this one
54:31 - hmm the card width is set to a hundred
54:35 - percent interesting let's see
55:07 - all right so we're actually not getting
55:15 - hmm yeah Joanne you caught that they're
55:19 - using a CSS background image yeah so
55:22 - that's kind of not that's not obvious
55:25 - from the way it looks in the code right
55:28 - let's show where the code is yeah so you
55:32 - have this card media and you put an
55:34 - image and Atari right it looks like this
55:36 - should convert it to an image tag but
55:38 - it's not it's a background image so I
55:42 - mean that's fine there's nothing wrong
55:44 - with that
55:47 - but it is gonna make we just have to
55:50 - make a decision really about what we're
55:53 - gonna do with these with these cards how
55:55 - we're gonna handle this this issue here
55:59 - I guess we could make
56:19 - John Hanson says you need to have the
56:21 - elements in each flex div stretch
56:40 - all right so what's the as it flex I'm
56:47 - not good enough with flexbox to know
56:49 - what the command is where you put
56:51 - stretch on flex start
56:57 - so is it flex flex basis flex direction
57:06 - I can look it up but I figured John if
57:13 - you knew offhand it might be faster
57:40 - yeah definitely not not basis I just saw
57:44 - it somewhere where did I have it at I
57:46 - was just thinking I just saw it in the
57:50 - documentation for material you I it was
57:55 - in the it was in the API for grid I
58:00 - think
58:06 - no not grid list
58:12 - do they not have an API grid align items
58:22 - okay we're justify content yep that's it
58:25 - that's what I just I just remember I saw
58:28 - it there
58:29 - you had it first that John thank you all
58:33 - right let's see flex yeah let's go
58:40 - million item stretch all right not that
58:45 - one
58:46 - let's try I might be putting it on the
58:48 - wrong thing - one time stretch let's try
58:57 - putting it on a different or something
59:00 - here
59:07 - nope hi this one
59:17 - nope
59:36 - okay alright so that's not working hi
59:40 - there I'm I may be doing it wrong but I
59:48 - think now we're back to we're not going
59:56 - to be able to use grid unless we make
60:00 - our own classes
60:15 - let's see you need to see what direction
60:18 - first row or column
60:29 - hmm let's see
60:35 - or what we have now that's for index e
60:45 - we don't have a container anymore that's
60:47 - setting it if we did it it was said it
60:49 - column don't know if we have our overall
60:55 - container still as is using flex
61:06 - yeah all right well my timer is up so I
61:13 - guess I'll work on this work on this for
61:18 - a little bit today maybe or tomorrow
61:22 - morning
61:23 - and so maybe before tomorrow a stream
61:27 - I'll have I'll have this working I'm not
61:32 - sure what the best solution will be at
61:34 - this point but I'll either create some
61:36 - of my own classes to handle the width
61:40 - issue or and continue using it with the
61:44 - the grid elements or I will just import
61:49 - the column classes from materialize and
61:55 - bring them in and use them just like we
61:57 - did in that bulletin project if we do it
62:03 - just like the bulletin project that does
62:04 - have the benefit of being able to just
62:06 - really reuse you know code between the
62:10 - two projects which is nice
62:14 - I'm also way more familiar with
62:17 - materialized column classes than I am
62:20 - with the material you eye classes for
62:24 - grid and all the options they have so
62:28 - we'll see it'll be one of those - all
62:34 - right so let me scroll up now to where I
62:39 - left off in the live chat and I'm gonna
62:41 - go through an answer everything that's
62:43 - in the live chat now if you have a
62:45 - question please put it in the chat now
62:47 - when I get through everything that'll be
62:50 - the end of the stream
62:52 - let's see kou-kun and Angie says Sweden
62:59 - says hello hello Sweden thanks for
63:02 - watching
63:10 - novena why can't we use polymer for
63:13 - material designs you can use polymer in
63:16 - a lot of cases I'm not sure where we're
63:19 - at as far as being able to use polymer
63:23 - components in react
63:25 - I'm sure it's either been done or
63:27 - there's somebody working on it some sort
63:29 - of you know library to be able to use
63:31 - that but I just haven't tried it so I I
63:37 - mean I'd be open to trying it probably
63:40 - not on this project because we you know
63:42 - we have a tight deadline so I don't want
63:44 - to have to learn something new if I can
63:48 - help it for this project but maybe for a
63:49 - future project we'll have to find it I
63:52 - said I'm not aware exactly if of anybody
63:55 - doing that right now but I'm sure
63:58 - somebody is doing it
64:13 - ah hey sin sins s YNS says hey how do
64:19 - you make your github look like that yes
64:22 - so I'm using the dark theme for github
64:24 - so you have to download tampermonkey if
64:30 - you're on Chrome
64:31 - I believe Firefox has an equivalent I
64:35 - don't know if it's called tampermonkey
64:36 - or something else and then you need to
64:38 - get the github dark script so if you
64:42 - type in github dark it should come up in
64:45 - the search and it'll have directions for
64:48 - how to make that work then you get this
64:50 - theme and you also get more options so
64:53 - you get all these github dark settings
64:55 - to change things and you know I have
65:00 - this theme on but there's lots of
65:01 - different themes that I could be using
65:04 - so anyway it's pretty cool I always like
65:08 - the dark themes better I think it's
65:10 - easier on the eyes but that's how I get
65:13 - my github it look like that
65:26 - journeys
65:48 - wait ah all right so w ey ir a waiver
65:54 - way uh sorry I want to pronounce that
65:58 - right so let me know I'm probably
66:00 - pronouncing it wrong let me know how it
66:01 - should be pronounced and I'll do my best
66:03 - to remember and pronounce it right
66:05 - but anyway they say I joined today and
66:08 - would love to do all five projects how
66:11 - do I find it okay
66:12 - I don't I have every project in its own
66:15 - playlist yet some of them have their own
66:17 - playlist but the live coding with Jessie
66:19 - playlist on this channel the free code
66:21 - camp channel on YouTube has all the
66:24 - projects in order if you go back to the
66:27 - first video that's project one and you
66:30 - go through right now the titles will
66:31 - tell you what project it is I think for
66:36 - project one I don't actually say it's
66:38 - project one but for all the projects
66:40 - after that I have it right in the title
66:42 - so it'll say like P two and then D like
66:46 - five for your like project to day five
66:49 - so right now that's like the one big
66:52 - playlist as everything I'm going to
66:54 - continue to break things out as well in
66:57 - the separate playlist to make it easier
66:59 - to follow along and I'm glad you join
67:05 - welcome
67:10 - I'm I'm mission says how long did it
67:14 - take you to learn graph QL I I don't
67:21 - know I mean I kind of I learned it on
67:23 - the stream with you also
67:25 - I've only been streaming for like eight
67:28 - months something like that maybe nine
67:31 - months so less than nine months for sure
67:34 - and probably way less than nine months
67:38 - so I don't I don't know graph QL like
67:42 - I'm no expert at graph QL I know enough
67:45 - to definitely use graph QL you know in
67:48 - terms of from the client side of getting
67:50 - things from graph QL in terms of setting
67:54 - things up servers
67:55 - I'm I don't really know that much about
67:58 - it so I haven't created my own graphic
68:00 - you of API from scratch or anything yet
68:03 - I imagine probably end up doing it at
68:06 - some point but to be able to learn how
68:09 - to get data from a graph QL API that's
68:13 - that's pretty easy especially if you
68:15 - already understand how API is work like
68:17 - a REST API it's not really that hard to
68:20 - make a jump to graph QL and if you're
68:23 - using some sort of helper library like
68:26 - if you're using Apollo you know it makes
68:29 - it really easy so if you want to get
68:32 - into graph QL I'd say like client side
68:37 - it shouldn't take too long at all
68:40 - server side I don't really know because
68:42 - I haven't gotten into that yet guru Tegh
68:52 - says why don't you try material design
68:54 - bootstrap you know what actually I I
69:00 - haven't checked on that in quite a while
69:02 - to see if that was good I remember you
69:05 - know several years ago when I was trying
69:07 - to decide on a material design
69:09 - you know framework to use I didn't like
69:13 - it as much as materialize I don't know
69:16 - where that projects at now although
69:17 - maybe it's better now I just don't know
69:23 - let's see Robert asks is it better to
69:27 - use materializer bootstrap I I don't I
69:31 - think it depends on what kind of look
69:34 - you want if you're trying to go for a
69:36 - material design look you're gonna it's
69:38 - going to be easier for you to use
69:40 - materialize you could certainly use
69:42 - bootstrap and then just adjust it you
69:45 - know I I wouldn't adjust it directly but
69:47 - I maybe like add you know a theme on the
69:50 - of your own on to use in addition to
69:52 - bootstrap then you could make it look
69:57 - like the tier design - but why you know
70:00 - I don't really see the point in spending
70:02 - all that time trying to turn bootstrap
70:04 - into something else
70:08 - so it just depends on the look if I
70:10 - didn't want a material design look if I
70:13 - didn't if it didn't matter whether or
70:14 - not I had a material design look maybe
70:17 - I'd go to bootstrap because more people
70:19 - use it so the odds of you know the
70:21 - testing is better right there's just way
70:23 - more people using it reporting errors
70:25 - and things like that more people working
70:27 - on it it would take me a little while to
70:31 - get used to the bootstrap way of doing
70:33 - things because I have much more
70:34 - experience with materialised I have
70:36 - build things with bootstrap before but
70:39 - you know with materialised I remember a
70:42 - lot of the classes without having to
70:44 - look them up with bootstrap I don't so
70:49 - for me I would probably go with
70:50 - materialise just because of that but if
70:52 - I was starting from scratch
70:54 - I'd go with if you want material design
70:56 - use materialized otherwise build a
70:59 - bootstrap that'd be my recommendation
71:09 - kaathal says only came in now what is
71:13 - masonry used for so the masonry the
71:18 - concept of a masonry grid is I mean it's
71:22 - pretty basically just this isn't a good
71:27 - example and it's all messed up now but
71:30 - basically you just have all these
71:32 - different you know elements with
71:36 - different shapes different sizes right
71:39 - different widths and Heights and they
71:41 - all fit together with the same amount of
71:43 - space in between with the same gutter
71:45 - and as you change the window width they
71:49 - all adjust so that you don't have this
71:50 - weird space in between that's what I
71:53 - mean when I'm talking about masonry and
71:55 - so we actually use this masonry
71:57 - component there it is react masonry
72:03 - component and what this does is it takes
72:06 - the masonry package that was made for up
72:10 - by I think it's like dis saundra or
72:12 - something like that trying to make one
72:16 - of the other thing so masonry use the
72:18 - free version
72:19 - there's another package JavaScript
72:22 - plug-in called isotope this is a paid
72:27 - version and it basically handles this
72:29 - masonry layout some sorting and things
72:33 - like that but it's just a regular you
72:37 - know JavaScript plug-in this is a
72:39 - component that takes that and you know
72:45 - it actually uses that code but it makes
72:48 - it into a react component so it makes it
72:51 - a lot easier to use with with react so
72:54 - that's how we're using you know masonry
72:58 - in our project and this is the best
73:04 - masonry layout library this one here
73:08 - that I've seen I wonder if there's a
73:12 - link I'm actually surprised that there's
73:22 - not a link to the original the original
73:27 - site
73:32 - hmm if you look up masonry or isotope as
73:37 - you know like a JavaScript plug-in you
73:40 - should find it and you'll see more demos
73:43 - and it kind of like what it could do
73:44 - here we go there's a link to dis Andros
73:50 - page so here it is this is the masonry
73:57 - grid layout so you can use it with
74:01 - jQuery without jQuery and the regular
74:04 - version but then if you want to use it
74:07 - with materialise I recommend using the
74:09 - the component that that we were just
74:12 - looking at just makes it a whole lot
74:16 - easier I believe we tried to do it with
74:18 - this on one project and it wasn't
74:22 - impossible to do but it was definitely
74:24 - more difficult
74:32 - I look says anyone here heard of em you
74:38 - URI Murray grid system does say miss
74:43 - thing as masonry only saw a live demo
74:47 - I've never heard of it I've never used
74:49 - it so I might be cool to check out you
74:52 - know see if it's if it's better than
74:55 - masonry I mean it seems like masonry is
74:58 - kept up to date I mean there's some
75:00 - updates from five days ago that's pretty
75:05 - cool yeah so maybe it's kept up to date
75:09 - but has been around for quite a while
75:11 - there might be something new or out
75:13 - there that does a better job maybe more
75:15 - lightweight
75:35 - Edwin says you robbed bro thanks for the
75:38 - for constant the constant motivation
75:40 - you're welcome I'm glad I can give you
75:43 - some some motivation here I actually had
75:46 - trouble getting motivated coming back
75:48 - from the holiday break there I thought
75:51 - about making a video about how I ended
75:54 - up getting myself motivated to help out
75:57 - so we'll see maybe I'll make one
76:01 - but this stream always motivates me so
76:04 - if I can help motivate you all I'm
76:06 - really happy about that
76:14 - then a yak says background size cover or
76:18 - 100% for the image maybe yeah let's try
76:21 - that out
76:22 - where's our here
76:40 - backgrounds cover about mmm nope
76:55 - good suggestion though
77:09 - Oh sin says they see the dark theme for
77:14 - github with stylish not same alright
77:17 - let's check out that dark theme then
77:23 - let's see I think this is what I use
77:34 - yeah this is this is what I use
77:43 - yeah so basically what you want to do is
77:59 - I think I used the userscript add-on
78:02 - it's yeah so I did the chrome install
78:07 - with tampermonkey so evidently there's a
78:12 - lot of different ways to use this so I
78:14 - already had tampermonkey installed
78:16 - that's why I did it this way if you
78:18 - don't have tampermonkey installed it
78:20 - looks like you can get you can get
78:24 - add-ons you know for other things so one
78:28 - of these ways should work the way I use
78:31 - was to add the script directly into
78:33 - tampermonkey beyond ad IO and any I'm
78:46 - pretty sure it's Dion right I think we
78:49 - may have talked about this before
78:50 - correct me if it's not if it's not
78:53 - pronounced that way
78:54 - Dion says bootstrap is more flexible
78:57 - materialized as more rigid to custom
78:59 - changes I definitely agree that's
79:01 - actually that's a really good answer so
79:03 - we were talking about whether or not to
79:05 - use materialized bootstrap that's a
79:07 - really good point bootstrap is more like
79:10 - designed neutral and meant to be changed
79:12 - but you realize it has a purpose of
79:15 - being material design style so it's it
79:19 - definitely is not as open to being
79:21 - adjusted so yeah I definitely agree so
79:24 - that's if you want material design go
79:27 - with it but if you don't care about
79:30 - material design bootstrap is definitely
79:33 - the way to go
79:34 - you'll have an easier time of creating
79:37 - your own style thanks for that deal and
79:40 - that was a really good point
79:51 - ketosis thanks for the thorough
79:54 - explanation on masonry you're welcome I
79:56 - hope that was helping for you let's see
80:08 - ok sin says yeah I use it with stylish
80:12 - and that works but it's not the same as
80:13 - yours that's interesting I wonder why
80:16 - it's possible mine's different because I
80:19 - have an older version I am an older
80:27 - version that's not been updated awhile
80:29 - co2 4 - oops
80:39 - oh yeah I think I may be pretty behind
80:45 - in terms of versions whoops
80:53 - where'd I find that 120 I don't know
81:01 - actually is this the CSS version you
81:05 - know I'm not that far behind
81:17 - that's weird does it auto-update then
81:23 - anyway I have no idea why mine looks
81:26 - different okay since ed I installed the
81:34 - tampermonkey one and it seems way better
81:36 - than the others okay cool I had never
81:39 - tried any other ones so I just lucked
81:41 - out then and got the good one right off
81:43 - the bat okay and it is the same cool
81:47 - yeah I did tell you truth I didn't even
81:49 - realize there were other ways to use it
81:51 - it's I sold it a while ago and I haven't
81:55 - looked at the documentation since then I
81:58 - haven't really tried out any options it
82:01 - might be cool to you mess with those at
82:03 - some point all right so I've got through
82:10 - the live chat and Wow my slack for work
82:14 - has a lot of messages and so does my
82:17 - email so now is a great time to wrap
82:22 - things up and see what's going on before
82:26 - I before I head out I actually have to
82:28 - leave work early because my car won't
82:30 - start so cold my car won't start
82:32 - so my wife's car is a lot newer and it
82:36 - is starting up so she has to pick me up
82:39 - from work and so she needs to pick me up
82:41 - earlier than normal so I need to quit
82:44 - talking and get ready and leave but
82:49 - thank you all so much for watching and
82:52 - for helping out in the live chat and
82:55 - thanks for all the questions I love it
82:57 - when there's a lot of questions gives me
83:00 - something to talk about and it's cool I
83:04 - like whenever we can help each other out
83:05 - I should be back tomorrow's Taurus
83:10 - Friday already Wow
83:12 - this week went so fast so anyway I
83:15 - should be back tomorrow around the same
83:17 - time I'm gonna try to do the streams
83:18 - closer to one o'clock now I used to
83:21 - always aim for two o'clock but I really
83:23 - want to do it earlier for everybody over
83:25 - and
83:26 - and in that area in that time zone
83:28 - because you know I don't want to keep
83:31 - you all up really late and I know
83:33 - there's a lot of viewers from that from
83:36 - that area of the world so plan on being
83:39 - around 1:00 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time
83:41 - I'll do my best to to keep it around
83:46 - that time and hopefully tomorrow I have
83:49 - some of this sorted out some of this
83:50 - masonry stuff sorted out and we'll have
83:52 - something a little bit nicer to look at
83:54 - but until then thanks again and have a
83:57 - great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie and welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're gonna continue on with what we were doing yesterday which was making a homepage using material design so we got our our buttons sorted out yesterday I think we got our bunch sorted out I just looked at it on my other screen here and they don't look right anymore he'll be on all right I'm on a different branch alright so I have my node member hat on today so you kind of see the node member on there so it's cold and today we get to dress down and my coworkers are trying to peek in on the last string we got to dress down today so I got to wear normally I have to wear dress clothes but I got to wear jeans my November hoodie so I haven't gotten to show off any of this gear on the stream so I figured I would today rights all right so let's get started I let me switch to y'all can see the screen okay so yesterday we got these buttons in here and they will keep this configuration no matter what the screen sizes and their narrow enough that they will fit on small screens even on the narrowest of phones the only thing I was thinking of with this and I'm not worrying about it right now cuz we're just gonna try to lay out a potential you know homepage to show my boss we might actually they have more than one will just I will probably just do it on different branches but I'm thinking maybe on a larger screen these buttons could be larger and then we'll use some media queries to scale them down on small screens we also put in this events section within this card and right now you know it's really basic I think this is enough just to kind of get the concept that we could put a list here it could be events it could be news whatever we wanted to put there now I'd like to fill in this using kind of like a masonry grid style and just throw in some different types of content just maybe some stock photos some areas for text some areas for video just so we have a nice visual what could happen with this homepage and I don't think we'll get this done today but if we do get that done today then maybe we'll move on and I'd like to do maybe a more traditional homepage that would be kind of linear and tell a story so you know would you'd still the hope here a section would be the same but then you may have just some full width sections that would explain what's so great about Franciscan University why would you want to come and finish up with another calltoaction at the bottom I think those will be two good points to start from and then I think we can get some feedback and you know we rework it we'll probably come back to this page several times over the next month or so and work on some interior pages as well but we'll go through a couple cycles of you know trying some stuff out getting feedback and then making some adjustments getting more feedback so enough talk let's start out this Pomodoro timer and I started doing some code now if you're not familiar with Pomodoro timer this is a way to break up your work and I like to use it when I'm working throughout the day but it's also nice on the stream because it reminds me to quit coding and check out the live chat and answer any questions that there may be in there so that's what I'm gonna do if you ask a question in the live chat during the 25 minute session please be patient and I will get to your question whenever the 25 minute period is over we'll do a break answer some questions do another 25 minute session so I'm hoping to do two coding sessions today let's start the first one all right so yep this is our our code and right now we're using react and we're using next js' to kind of scaffold out our react app next j/s offers a serverside rendering without very much work on our part and then it offers us a routing system built in so anything in this pages folder will become its own route so the home page is indexed j/s but then the other pages are just you know what their names are here so we have we have a page called page we have a page called faculty all right so we're going to be working on just on the home page today so we're gonna scroll down normally you wouldn't want to hardcode things in your component like this this end is going to end up being a really big component once we're done with it but then what we'll do is once we're set on a design we'll go back and we'll actually break these down into other components and have it populated with data you know from an a database we'll pull it in with a graph QL API and then that way these will get a lot smaller we won't clutter them up with you know with a lot of you know text content right here in the component okay so I'd like to add let's see I think I'd like to break up this section here and two maybe two cars let's see how this looks breaking this up into two cards I don't want it to be too too small but at least on a large screen I think I would it would be okay to have it like that so let's try that first see all right so here's that first card and just has an image at the top so what we'll do is we'll just copy this now we're using material UI for a lot of our components because it uses that Google's material design if you're not familiar with react just think about using the bootstrap for a regular site material UI plays the same role for a react app as bootstrap plays for just a normal you know HTML site but in in this case it's following material design and this we need to make this alright that's good and then let's change these values so instead of we have a 12 column grid so if you give it a value of 12 that means it's full width if you give it a value of 6 that means it takes a path the width of the screen so we want it to take up 1/4 so we're gonna put in 3 so that each one of these takes up only 3 columns let's say that see what we get alright great so now we've lit this up into two cards on let's see what screen size we can get I'm gonna shrink this down just to get a more realistic screen size the screen that I have on right now that you can see is is pretty large 20 it's over 20 inches I don't remember how how much over 20 inches it is and it's also a 2k screen so it's not not everybody's gonna have a screen like this ok not bad I think we can definitely fit some content in here and it won't look you know too small let's see so I just checking out the live chat a bit hey everybody alright so let's throw in some text content in here and I don't have to think about what I want to put in here so let's remove this media and you know let's remove this card actions so I think what happen is when we originally put this in here I think the card content would have been the proper thing to use but it was overlaying over top of the image or something was happening so that's why we ended up born with this card actions normally you would actually have you know clickable actions in here so let's get rid of some of this yeah this just get rid of that and let's put in I believe it's card Connie has card content so if you're not familiar with what's going on here these components that we're using they don't come builtin with react these come from the material UI component library so we have to bring in material which we just added it through node package manager and we've import these components up the top you see we're bringing in these components for material UI and and I am using Visual Studio code as my editor if you've seen in previous videos you know that I I've used atom before so I'm still getting used to what I have here I was expecting a autocomplete for this for this tag I thought it would make the closing tag automatically but it didn't so to check my settings but a bit of the card content and then we'll want to do a typography typography tag and let's go with type and give it a type of let's give it a type of h3 just see what size it is and let's just say it's a 99% graduates I was super awesome alright so that is definitely going to draw students in let's see how that looks wow that's really small I can't believe h3 is that small maybe that's not even a real type I guess we'll try an h2 and see I hate to use age tags unless they're actually headings hmm all right something's wrong let's look up typography in the material UI documentation may be under style yep typography okay if you want to follow along and check out the documentation be sure to get the documentation for the latest version so for the beta version so the URL is material UI next calm okay check out the API hmm okay you can't put an H you could put in display that's weird for some reason I thought you could put in a stag's maybe my memory is just terrible or maybe this changed at some point all right well now we definitely need to switch things up a bit so let's see what we want let's try display two there we go all right not bad just to show and we're gonna have to be hmm here's where we're gonna have to be careful and we'll be able to see it when I add some more cards in but I want to make sure that these gaps get filled in so we wouldn't have the next row all starting here and then a big gap here and I also don't want this card just to fill up the space and have a lot of white space here so let's see what happens when we do this with this current grid system we're using if we don't get what we want we're gonna have to try something different but I do have some ideas so I think I have at least two ideas one of them I know has worked for me before on previous sites so we'll try them up okay and I know that I see there's some questions in the live chat I'm gonna go over all the questions in about 13 minutes so whenever this timer is is done I'm gonna get all the questions so just please be patient and I'll do my best to answer everything all right so let's just add in some more cards I really want to see how these stack and the easiest way to do this is just going to be to throw in some more items so first thing I'm going to try to do is still like this within the same container I'm not sure exactly if this will work or novelist's try it out okay so doing it this way you see we have the problem that I thought we would have let's go to the documentation and see if there's already a builtin way to solve this okay I'm sorry I just glanced there michael says can't follow along as usual at the hospital getting my biweekly phlebotomy for a blood issue I hope everything's okay with your your health issues Michael so I didn't realize that you had that so I hope it's not really serious always like talking with you here on the live chat so anyway if doing the stream at this time conflicts regularly with your appointments let me know and maybe eggs try to do it a different time because I'd hate for you to have to miss okay where we at grid area okay so we're we're checking out the grid here online content interface between his face around the foolish well alright let's check out the demos I don't not worry about that all right I don't think there's anything covering that stretch centers my staff listens I'm a maybe align content or align items would work but I don't know I'm I'm a little skeptical that this would do anything all right so I'm gonna go to my next options right so I have two ideas one idea we've used before previous projects and that's to bring in masonry layout package that'll handle all this for us and we'll position things using javascript I'd rather not do that if we don't have to but we might have to my other idea and we saw this yesterday briefly it just kind of caught my eye so I thought why not try is to use or is it I don't remember what it was called so I'm I have to go through this list it was a great list you know what I don't want to go through the API I want the demos component demos I think this was it I think it was the grid list let me see if this is actually giving us what we want you know it's so far I'm just seeing I'm seeing everything in the same height in each row so the still isn't really solving the issue so let me check and check the source okay there they're mapping over this all right so I'm going to I'm gonna adjust the height okay yeah this is pretty much what I thought let's adjust see if there's anything happens yeah so this isn't gonna help us either we still have these gaps okay I don't think there's anything builtin to material UI I'm going to go through this list quickly just to see if there's something that maybe I'm missing here yeah I'm I'm not seeing anything okay so we're still gonna be able to use the grid the grid elements most likely but we're gonna add in package it's going to use a little bit of JavaScript to position each one of these cards and the position will update if the screen width changes and that way we're always going to have we're going to make use of all our space we're not gonna have these big gaps trying to think where did we use this we did use this on on the project actually let me let me see if it bullets I don't know if I actually made this site now I didn't I think I just have the site locally I don't I don't have a live version of it but we did this on the bulletin site so that'll probably be the best thing to look at to figure out how we're gonna do this so let's check out github and I'll make my font size a bit bigger wow I just got a bunch of emails my work email alright it looks like nothing is important here we go bulletin react so I'm going to that FUS mark home bulletin react repository and let's check out a source and it's our views probably homework it's been a while since I've looked at this repo grid renderer okay so you got to find rid renderer cojones there we go let's open up grid view and list our grid render and grid view to try to see what's going on and let's see okay all right I see it looks like what we had done here was we imported some CSS from another library so not material UI I think we imported some of the classes from materialized CSS which is basically just like bootstrap accepted as material design styles so I'd rather not import this if we don't have to certainly not gonna import the whole thing I mean I maybe would pull little pieces of it if we need it but it seems like yeah this is something we could definitely do alright and let me check this one out as well grid renderer okay this is just switching us between the different views so we have in this particular project we had a toggle well actually is more than at all you could you could toggle grid view or list view but then you could also go to a print view if you wanted to it's not going to be that complicated for us we're gonna have one view I mean we could certainly have more than one if we wanted but let's just start off with one okay I'm gonna pull this over onto my other screen to make it easier for me to reference it and then let's pull up our code on this screen and let's make sure let's double check that this repo that we are using is uptodate react react nation tree component check to make sure it's up to date they haven't had any braking changes or anything that we need to be aware of so we can go to the releases and see their last release was up 20 second let me think I think that we we worked on this project the bulletin project around or after that time so there shouldn't be changes we could always verify by looking at the package.json and our project so we'll bring back that repo here check out the package.json and see react nation component sixpoint 0.1 yeah so we'll have the same versions which is good so we won't we should be able to do this the same way and a reward and yep that makes me components all right so my timer is about up I'd say the last thing we could do is yarn add react masonry components and we'll let that install while I go back to the live chat I'm going to take a short break and scroll up and try to answer all your questions all right Dimitri yes where I got the the grid where I import the grid from its hero UI so let's check that out where you import so I had to do like an NPM install of material UI so I have already done it so I'm not going to do it again but you if you're using NPM I think what would be NPM it's it install save so how you do it it's been so long since I just used NPM but co UI or what I usually do is I use yarn so I do the yarn add material UI that will bring that into your project and then you can do the imports and you can use material UI so check out the material UI github repo or their website and it'll walk you through how to import that into your project and use it and this is for react only that you want to use those components so if you're not doing a react project that's this is not what you want to use if you'd like to use material design and a non react project try out materialized CSS and I think that's I think it's materialized calm and mature as a materialized CSS calm it's worth looking up yeah materialized CSS calm that's what you want to use for you know like a non reacts ight you know plain HTML site it's basically any site that you normally want to use bootstrap for you can replace bootstrap with materialise and it'll give you the same stuff just in material design style Patrick's is one percent of graduates are super lame yeah I didn't really think that one through but I guess that that's they could just be regular awesome they don't have to be lame so it's 99% of graduates are super awesome and yeah let's change that up right now because I could see that could be problematic how's that see then there's no negative connotation everybody's some type of awesome the hopeless Brit says might be a silly question but do web developers working in offices have an open mind about people who think out loud when programming I guess it shouldn't matter if people have earphones in I actually can hear it so I have my own office so I don't have other people working right next to me so it's not really a problem but I can hear the person in the office next to me I can hear them on the other side of my wall talking sometimes but only if I don't have my headphones on so you're right I wear headphones all the time when I'm working I always have music going so noise doesn't bother me if I happen to not have headphones on for some reason I can hear noise it's usually not a problem for me there's a classroom right on this side of my office and I can hear the professor's lecturing in their classroom depending on who the professor is I can hear them and that can be somewhat distracting if I don't have my headphones on but I would say I mean if if you're the type of person that needs to talk things out out loud then if you can at all like stay away from the other people you know get a little bit farther away from that probably best just to be respectful I guess you can't make them wear headphones so huh I don't know how I'd handle that luckily I don't have to deal with that I'm not sure how I would handle that one yeah it doesn't bother me personally because I can always wear the headphones I'm gonna go back to the coding here in just a second I wanted to make sure I made a note of where I'm leaving off 19 okay so the last comment that I got to a live chat is from a beam of sis I don't know how but I'm in love with material design all right well this is this is the stream for you because we material design everything here all right so the rest of the questions I'm going to get to after this next coding session if you can't stick around to hear the answer then check out the recording of this stream later on when you have a chance and I'll answer all the questions towards the end of the the stream all right what were you doing okay I just installed the masonry layout great so let's bring in masonry and like I mentioned at the beginning the stream but I think it's worth mentioning again I wouldn't keep this component as it is now in this state I would definitely refactor this and remove as much of this as I could into separate components so just for now when we're messing around I don't think it's worth it to make all these different components because we may not even keep half of them you know for the finished product but eventually this will need to be refactored it would just be a mess to come in here and try to figure out what's going on if we left it like this also we are going to be able to reuse a lot of these components and other places in the site so right we can't reuse them if they only exist in here all right so we got masonry in here now now let's try to do something with it so let's wrap that was a really hard piece out I just made those weird let's wrap our components in this masonry hmm let's see what happens if I change this grid to masonry I'm not really expecting this to work but if it does it'll be pretty awesome and quick so it's always worth a shot then I wrap the wrong thing in here I did all right let's try it again I didn't mean to wrap that part and it this is what I wanted to wrap in in masonry and I need to get rid of container and all the way down here Mason all right well that's something right let's see probably let's see i flex Thanks I think our we're gonna we're not going to be able to use grid okay just rook just says in the live chat that for the new newest versions of NPM you don't need to use the save flag anymore you can just NPM I and then the package name alright cool that's that's a lot shorter so I mean I mentioned earlier a much longer way to do it it's unnecessary so you could just do NPM I and then with your UI or whatever package you have thanks for that rook I'm behind the times on on NPM that is much easier all right so let's change these let's change all this grid stuff because the the CSS that's going along with all this these grid components is conflicting with what we're trying to do in masonry so let's for now just change these all to divs all right so they're all going to be divs I don't think it's going to work we're gonna have to add some other classes to that all right let's all right so for everything where we have the three let's just say hmm now I understand why we added in the materialized classes last time I'd hoped we wouldn't need to do that but we probably will so let's go with style with 25% we have a 25% with for that one and then for the ones that are six oh why don't we have another six yeah three three six we should have another six do we not add another one I guess we didn't okay so only have one that's small six and for this one we're going to change it to be 50% we're not going to keep things like this this is just to test it out if this works we'll change these into classes so just to test we're kind of making our own little grid system here our little column system I said probably won't stay like this once mmm let me see what the styles aren't here I gotta be missing something okay I'm checking out how we implemented this in the previous project just to see if I'm missing something hmm I think we're missing anything let's see we had our masonry layout up didn't we their react nation tree component let's take a look at their documentation just look at that basic usage mystery options you let me check I think we're using the Maestri component right I think the problem is our containers this a little bit better let's try this so we we had a display flex on our hero cards which this is not really a great name for these now at one time they were gonna peak up into the hero section let's try to use this without display there we go all right better much better there we go okay all right so you can see how this is supposed to work obviously we need to set our our gutter right our space between which we haven't done but aside from the awkwardness of that you can see we're not wasting space right if we had more cards you would see it would really not be wasting a lot of space we we didn't add in anything for smaller strains but this would of course everything would go full width and for a smaller screen but this is what I wanted this kind of fluid grid system that automatically adjusts it doesn't take up space all right not bad would rather not have have to do this in a totally different way let me think just wondering if I could read implement our grid and just adjust the CSS for the container and if that would work I think it's worth a shot it's not like I did that much work that it would be hard to to get it back so I'm just gonna hit the back button a bit bring our grid back and then take these out see what happens okay not not super terrible actually so if we can just figure out what's making this so thin we might be able to continue to use our grid which is nice that means we don't have to come up with our own our own system our own column system or we don't have to import it from materialize all right so let's check out this is the container div and I can bring dev tools over for this so we're checking out that container div that definitely needs to be bigger or else you all can't see it let's switch this around a bit to move this over and stretch this out there we go alright so this is a container you can see it's getting this positionabsolute the exact positioning from the JavaScript which is what we wanted let's see I'm gonna go through so removing that doesn't really do anything let's see there's anything in here that looks like it might mess things up no nothing there just doublecheck yeah if we took out everything we needed there okay okay so if we switch from using having it say max with 25% and instead have with 25% then that works a lot better mmm so I guess now the question is is it worth it to go in and switch these classes up or should we bring in our own system so much time we have before we tackle at eight minutes let's we don't really have to change anything in here we just need to add with oh okay John Hansen I just saw your comment about the image with that makes sense so notice this was only happening on images so let's take this back to max with so the text was fine the events are the events are okay they do look different than they did before but this actually isn't yeah let's see if we can do this so we want the interior of not of that one this one hmm the card width is set to a hundred percent interesting let's see all right so we're actually not getting hmm yeah Joanne you caught that they're using a CSS background image yeah so that's kind of not that's not obvious from the way it looks in the code right let's show where the code is yeah so you have this card media and you put an image and Atari right it looks like this should convert it to an image tag but it's not it's a background image so I mean that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but it is gonna make we just have to make a decision really about what we're gonna do with these with these cards how we're gonna handle this this issue here I guess we could make John Hanson says you need to have the elements in each flex div stretch all right so what's the as it flex I'm not good enough with flexbox to know what the command is where you put stretch on flex start so is it flex flex basis flex direction I can look it up but I figured John if you knew offhand it might be faster yeah definitely not not basis I just saw it somewhere where did I have it at I was just thinking I just saw it in the documentation for material you I it was in the it was in the API for grid I think no not grid list do they not have an API grid align items okay we're justify content yep that's it that's what I just I just remember I saw it there you had it first that John thank you all right let's see flex yeah let's go million item stretch all right not that one let's try I might be putting it on the wrong thing one time stretch let's try putting it on a different or something here nope hi this one nope okay alright so that's not working hi there I'm I may be doing it wrong but I think now we're back to we're not going to be able to use grid unless we make our own classes let's see you need to see what direction first row or column hmm let's see or what we have now that's for index e we don't have a container anymore that's setting it if we did it it was said it column don't know if we have our overall container still as is using flex yeah all right well my timer is up so I guess I'll work on this work on this for a little bit today maybe or tomorrow morning and so maybe before tomorrow a stream I'll have I'll have this working I'm not sure what the best solution will be at this point but I'll either create some of my own classes to handle the width issue or and continue using it with the the grid elements or I will just import the column classes from materialize and bring them in and use them just like we did in that bulletin project if we do it just like the bulletin project that does have the benefit of being able to just really reuse you know code between the two projects which is nice I'm also way more familiar with materialized column classes than I am with the material you eye classes for grid and all the options they have so we'll see it'll be one of those all right so let me scroll up now to where I left off in the live chat and I'm gonna go through an answer everything that's in the live chat now if you have a question please put it in the chat now when I get through everything that'll be the end of the stream let's see koukun and Angie says Sweden says hello hello Sweden thanks for watching novena why can't we use polymer for material designs you can use polymer in a lot of cases I'm not sure where we're at as far as being able to use polymer components in react I'm sure it's either been done or there's somebody working on it some sort of you know library to be able to use that but I just haven't tried it so I I mean I'd be open to trying it probably not on this project because we you know we have a tight deadline so I don't want to have to learn something new if I can help it for this project but maybe for a future project we'll have to find it I said I'm not aware exactly if of anybody doing that right now but I'm sure somebody is doing it ah hey sin sins s YNS says hey how do you make your github look like that yes so I'm using the dark theme for github so you have to download tampermonkey if you're on Chrome I believe Firefox has an equivalent I don't know if it's called tampermonkey or something else and then you need to get the github dark script so if you type in github dark it should come up in the search and it'll have directions for how to make that work then you get this theme and you also get more options so you get all these github dark settings to change things and you know I have this theme on but there's lots of different themes that I could be using so anyway it's pretty cool I always like the dark themes better I think it's easier on the eyes but that's how I get my github it look like that journeys wait ah all right so w ey ir a waiver way uh sorry I want to pronounce that right so let me know I'm probably pronouncing it wrong let me know how it should be pronounced and I'll do my best to remember and pronounce it right but anyway they say I joined today and would love to do all five projects how do I find it okay I don't I have every project in its own playlist yet some of them have their own playlist but the live coding with Jessie playlist on this channel the free code camp channel on YouTube has all the projects in order if you go back to the first video that's project one and you go through right now the titles will tell you what project it is I think for project one I don't actually say it's project one but for all the projects after that I have it right in the title so it'll say like P two and then D like five for your like project to day five so right now that's like the one big playlist as everything I'm going to continue to break things out as well in the separate playlist to make it easier to follow along and I'm glad you join welcome I'm I'm mission says how long did it take you to learn graph QL I I don't know I mean I kind of I learned it on the stream with you also I've only been streaming for like eight months something like that maybe nine months so less than nine months for sure and probably way less than nine months so I don't I don't know graph QL like I'm no expert at graph QL I know enough to definitely use graph QL you know in terms of from the client side of getting things from graph QL in terms of setting things up servers I'm I don't really know that much about it so I haven't created my own graphic you of API from scratch or anything yet I imagine probably end up doing it at some point but to be able to learn how to get data from a graph QL API that's that's pretty easy especially if you already understand how API is work like a REST API it's not really that hard to make a jump to graph QL and if you're using some sort of helper library like if you're using Apollo you know it makes it really easy so if you want to get into graph QL I'd say like client side it shouldn't take too long at all server side I don't really know because I haven't gotten into that yet guru Tegh says why don't you try material design bootstrap you know what actually I I haven't checked on that in quite a while to see if that was good I remember you know several years ago when I was trying to decide on a material design you know framework to use I didn't like it as much as materialize I don't know where that projects at now although maybe it's better now I just don't know let's see Robert asks is it better to use materializer bootstrap I I don't I think it depends on what kind of look you want if you're trying to go for a material design look you're gonna it's going to be easier for you to use materialize you could certainly use bootstrap and then just adjust it you know I I wouldn't adjust it directly but I maybe like add you know a theme on the of your own on to use in addition to bootstrap then you could make it look like the tier design but why you know I don't really see the point in spending all that time trying to turn bootstrap into something else so it just depends on the look if I didn't want a material design look if I didn't if it didn't matter whether or not I had a material design look maybe I'd go to bootstrap because more people use it so the odds of you know the testing is better right there's just way more people using it reporting errors and things like that more people working on it it would take me a little while to get used to the bootstrap way of doing things because I have much more experience with materialised I have build things with bootstrap before but you know with materialised I remember a lot of the classes without having to look them up with bootstrap I don't so for me I would probably go with materialise just because of that but if I was starting from scratch I'd go with if you want material design use materialized otherwise build a bootstrap that'd be my recommendation kaathal says only came in now what is masonry used for so the masonry the concept of a masonry grid is I mean it's pretty basically just this isn't a good example and it's all messed up now but basically you just have all these different you know elements with different shapes different sizes right different widths and Heights and they all fit together with the same amount of space in between with the same gutter and as you change the window width they all adjust so that you don't have this weird space in between that's what I mean when I'm talking about masonry and so we actually use this masonry component there it is react masonry component and what this does is it takes the masonry package that was made for up by I think it's like dis saundra or something like that trying to make one of the other thing so masonry use the free version there's another package JavaScript plugin called isotope this is a paid version and it basically handles this masonry layout some sorting and things like that but it's just a regular you know JavaScript plugin this is a component that takes that and you know it actually uses that code but it makes it into a react component so it makes it a lot easier to use with with react so that's how we're using you know masonry in our project and this is the best masonry layout library this one here that I've seen I wonder if there's a link I'm actually surprised that there's not a link to the original the original site hmm if you look up masonry or isotope as you know like a JavaScript plugin you should find it and you'll see more demos and it kind of like what it could do here we go there's a link to dis Andros page so here it is this is the masonry grid layout so you can use it with jQuery without jQuery and the regular version but then if you want to use it with materialise I recommend using the the component that that we were just looking at just makes it a whole lot easier I believe we tried to do it with this on one project and it wasn't impossible to do but it was definitely more difficult I look says anyone here heard of em you URI Murray grid system does say miss thing as masonry only saw a live demo I've never heard of it I've never used it so I might be cool to check out you know see if it's if it's better than masonry I mean it seems like masonry is kept up to date I mean there's some updates from five days ago that's pretty cool yeah so maybe it's kept up to date but has been around for quite a while there might be something new or out there that does a better job maybe more lightweight Edwin says you robbed bro thanks for the for constant the constant motivation you're welcome I'm glad I can give you some some motivation here I actually had trouble getting motivated coming back from the holiday break there I thought about making a video about how I ended up getting myself motivated to help out so we'll see maybe I'll make one but this stream always motivates me so if I can help motivate you all I'm really happy about that then a yak says background size cover or 100% for the image maybe yeah let's try that out where's our here backgrounds cover about mmm nope good suggestion though Oh sin says they see the dark theme for github with stylish not same alright let's check out that dark theme then let's see I think this is what I use yeah this is this is what I use yeah so basically what you want to do is I think I used the userscript addon it's yeah so I did the chrome install with tampermonkey so evidently there's a lot of different ways to use this so I already had tampermonkey installed that's why I did it this way if you don't have tampermonkey installed it looks like you can get you can get addons you know for other things so one of these ways should work the way I use was to add the script directly into tampermonkey beyond ad IO and any I'm pretty sure it's Dion right I think we may have talked about this before correct me if it's not if it's not pronounced that way Dion says bootstrap is more flexible materialized as more rigid to custom changes I definitely agree that's actually that's a really good answer so we were talking about whether or not to use materialized bootstrap that's a really good point bootstrap is more like designed neutral and meant to be changed but you realize it has a purpose of being material design style so it's it definitely is not as open to being adjusted so yeah I definitely agree so that's if you want material design go with it but if you don't care about material design bootstrap is definitely the way to go you'll have an easier time of creating your own style thanks for that deal and that was a really good point ketosis thanks for the thorough explanation on masonry you're welcome I hope that was helping for you let's see ok sin says yeah I use it with stylish and that works but it's not the same as yours that's interesting I wonder why it's possible mine's different because I have an older version I am an older version that's not been updated awhile co2 4 oops oh yeah I think I may be pretty behind in terms of versions whoops where'd I find that 120 I don't know actually is this the CSS version you know I'm not that far behind that's weird does it autoupdate then anyway I have no idea why mine looks different okay since ed I installed the tampermonkey one and it seems way better than the others okay cool I had never tried any other ones so I just lucked out then and got the good one right off the bat okay and it is the same cool yeah I did tell you truth I didn't even realize there were other ways to use it it's I sold it a while ago and I haven't looked at the documentation since then I haven't really tried out any options it might be cool to you mess with those at some point all right so I've got through the live chat and Wow my slack for work has a lot of messages and so does my email so now is a great time to wrap things up and see what's going on before I before I head out I actually have to leave work early because my car won't start so cold my car won't start so my wife's car is a lot newer and it is starting up so she has to pick me up from work and so she needs to pick me up earlier than normal so I need to quit talking and get ready and leave but thank you all so much for watching and for helping out in the live chat and thanks for all the questions I love it when there's a lot of questions gives me something to talk about and it's cool I like whenever we can help each other out I should be back tomorrow's Taurus Friday already Wow this week went so fast so anyway I should be back tomorrow around the same time I'm gonna try to do the streams closer to one o'clock now I used to always aim for two o'clock but I really want to do it earlier for everybody over and and in that area in that time zone because you know I don't want to keep you all up really late and I know there's a lot of viewers from that from that area of the world so plan on being around 100 100 p.m. Eastern Time I'll do my best to to keep it around that time and hopefully tomorrow I have some of this sorted out some of this masonry stuff sorted out and we'll have something a little bit nicer to look at but until then thanks again and have a great day
