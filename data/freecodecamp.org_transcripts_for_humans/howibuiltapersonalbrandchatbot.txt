00:00 - Yo, what's up  it's your roomie and I'm back. So, in this video
00:03 - I'm going to talk to you about how I built a personal Chatbot for myself.
00:07 - Yes, I built a Yoroomie Chatbot
00:10 - How I've leveraged this Chatbot to scale my reach and build my brand as you probably noticed from the past videos
00:17 - I'm not just a serial entrepreneur
00:19 - I am a maker so I love building things and taking my ideas to MVP to launching them to getting feedback and
00:26 - Turning them into revenue generating startups, or if I understand this not something people do not want and there
00:32 - I'm going to charge money
00:33 - I pay for simply shut it down also something that I would say and this is more recently which
00:38 - Really is something that I enjoy is actually documenting the process sharing as much as I can about the process of going from
00:46 - Idea to revenue generating startups
00:48 - so
00:49 - They're doing this the best way to do it is obviously through
00:52 - Content. One of the recent builds that I did is our Chatbot which I'l link down here the previous video
00:57 - I did on our Chatbot but I built our Chatbot in the open and really just
01:02 - Kind of let everyone follow along. The feedback I got from it. It was amazing
01:08 - People loved seeing me take an idea to Chatbot - literally generating thousands of messages
01:13 - via this Chatbot and eventually turning this into something more than just an idea an initial kind of MVP, so
01:20 - After I did this build I also really became
01:25 - Convinced in the power of Chatbots. You know with Chatbots, I immediately saw how I could kind of
01:31 - Leverage this conversational design that Chatbots have with other
01:36 - Concepts and so I knew that I needed to then build another Chabot. Now, I was kind of thinking
01:42 - You know, what should I build?
01:43 - And I didn't really just want to build another standalone product that didn't kind of benefit everything
01:48 - I was already doing and I'd also think you know thought about my
01:52 - Personal kind of open content that I put out and my personal brand, and I just realized that
01:57 - You know how beneficial it would be for me to build a you ever be chat line now one of the first reasons why I?
02:03 - Thought this would be beneficial is because it's basically
02:07 - social platforms consolidated into one
02:10 - So everyone's like hey be omnipresent across all all social platforms and get your content
02:15 - you know purposed across everything and I was just thinking like that's a lot to keep up with of course I tried to be
02:21 - Omnipresent, but I really want one kind of one place to send one message in this route
02:27 - You know the highest quality message
02:28 - I could and it's make it easier for people to not have to like follow me on everything so I thought facebook Messenger would be
02:34 - A perfect place to do this because I can kind of package up all the channels and all the content into this
02:40 - Chatbot this would be ultimately ultimately the kind of centralized place where I would want to push people to
02:45 - All right now
02:46 - The other is it that I thought was the ability to control the narrative
02:50 - So that's something when you know you have content across all the channels it can kind of become fragmented
02:55 - And then the message can also become fragmented so having this one channel
02:59 - would allow me to control what I wanted to tell people in that narrative and then ultimately how its received
03:05 - Which of course is very beneficial when you're trying to get something out to people and then people add scale. The other
03:12 - That I was thinking about which is a big benefit of having a personal Chatbot is
03:18 - You know people spend all their time on Facebook like let's admit you and I both spend a ton of time on Facebook
03:24 - And when you get that message someone messages you through Facebook, and you hear that Ding
03:29 - You're gonna look at your phone most likely well at least probably over an email or a text message
03:34 - I know I do personally so I just thought wow I mean what better way to reach people than where they spent all their time
03:40 - Which is Facebook Messenger, which is where the Chatbot would be?
03:44 - Accessible to people now that I kind of thought about the benefits of it. I was totally convinced all right
03:49 - I just need to build this Chatbot. The process that I use to build my Yoroomie Chatbot was fairly straightforward
03:56 - It kind of follows a lot of the other
03:58 - process from my other side projects
04:00 - but I first thought about
04:02 - You know why I was building this and how this will be valuable for people and try to define that come up with this?
04:07 - kind of Chatbot
04:08 - And it was really first off just identifying the goal of just making a place where people can learn more about me
04:16 - consume my content and
04:18 - Contact me regarding
04:21 - projects, or you know helping them out if they have any questions about this when I kind of
04:25 - Have that down, then I needed to kind of go into okay?
04:28 - All these channels that I just mentioned for instance all these medium articles
04:32 - How do I then include those because they're already out there?
04:34 - Their already  something that I get a ton of really good feedback on even these YouTube videos
04:39 - So how do I then package them in my Chatbot because that's the best way you know to let people consume this content
04:46 - Featured in there so what I came up with was actually a Yoroomie playbook
04:50 - So I thought you know what does all the content cover?
04:53 - And it's really about going from an idea to MVP to revenue-generating startup to scale and even some acquisitions
05:00 - That I've had in the past so what better way to
05:03 - Kind of package this up and make it easier for people to navigate and having a Yoroomie Playbook in my Chatbot
05:10 - so that's actually what I did so I
05:13 - repurposed a lot of medium articles in sequence in a playbook and also these videos in the Chatbot I'll screenshot here a
05:21 - For the actual dashboard for Chatfuel so I did use Chatfuel and I used I actually took the "Our Chatbot"
05:28 - Template and I repurposed it so I simply
05:31 - Duplicated that to create the Yoroomie bot and then I simply modified using the blocks
05:35 - The content that would be there, so on the screenshot here, you can see the Chatfuel dashboard
05:40 - And it's actually my playbook, and then it's the about me ask a question, and then It's contact me or
05:48 - And then after that is the actual kind of share
05:50 - So there's a little reality effect in theirs that people could then message their other friends through messenger and share, so that's kind of basic
05:58 - Template that. I you used in chat fuel so they're very
06:02 - straightforward, so this took less than an hour honestly what it came down to is just getting all the existing content that I had
06:09 - Already put out kind of packaging it up
06:12 - Through this Chatbot you know just modifying the templates and then kind of testing that conversational interface and design
06:19 - And just modifying it so I can make it kind of as natural and smooth as possible
06:23 - based off of what people actually want to see
06:26 - And would be interested in. After about an hour.
06:29 - Maybe an hour at most I actually had this Yoroomie Chatbot live. What I did from that was I actually
06:35 - Responded to some emails that I got from people asking me questions
06:39 - And I pointed them towards the link for the Chatbot, and and you know just I said hey
06:44 - I'm building this Chatbot. You know because I get a lot of questions that are similar to yours
06:49 - Here's a direct answer to your question
06:51 - But I would love if you could give me some feedback on this Chatbot that I just made by literally like 30 minutes ago
06:57 - so I did that and
07:00 - you know people were very receptive to that. It was only like five or six at first, but I got some really good feedback, so I
07:07 - Made some improvements on that conversational flow
07:09 - And now that's great so it's like my first kind of user feedback then from there
07:14 - I followed a typical kind of launch framework that I take for products because this was and it is a kind of a product
07:21 - It's just my chatbot for myself featuring my content packaged up as a playbook
07:26 - but I then went to Botlist which I know I've mentioned Seth the founder of Botlist. He is
07:31 - Amazing when it comes down to chatbots. He knows everything. Well his website
07:36 - Botlist is a great place to take your Chatbot and get your first users
07:41 - So I posted on, Yoroomie bot, on Botlist which I'll screenshot the profile here
07:46 - But it got around 4,000 initial views
07:49 - So I'm would say maybe a couple hundred users from that from people had actually tried it out
07:54 - Got a few people to review it so it's kind of like an app store for Chatbots.
07:58 - So it was a perfect place for me to launch from there
08:01 - I've actually taken  created a bitly short link so I have a bit.ly slash
08:07 - Yoroomie and that's actually my chatbot link so now instead of just having my website and all my content everywhere
08:13 - I can actually link directly to my ChatBot and the benefit of that is people can obviously consume that content and
08:21 - And you know find my playbook through there, but then when people when people use the Chatbot they can contact me
08:28 - But they're also kind of a subscribed user so then when I come out with new content
08:33 - I can actually push them a message
08:35 - And they'll be the first to know through my chatbot
08:38 - About this new content that I have coming out so I actually want to go into another video talking about now
08:44 - After I've launched the Chatbot how effective Chatbots can be for sending messages
08:49 - Versus sending emails, but I'm gonna keep this video short
08:52 - You can expect another video coming up soon talking about that results, but so far
08:57 - I've had some amazing feedback on it
08:58 - And it seems to be actually adding value to people that do have questions and are interested in taking their idea to an MVP
09:06 - To live--to revenue generating startup, so why don't you check it out? I'll link down here below the Chatbot but comment below
09:13 - Let me know what you think give me some real honest feedback on it
09:16 - And I definitely want to improve and hit subscribe so I keep making these videos. See you :)
