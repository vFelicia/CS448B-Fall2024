With timestamps:

00:00 - this is my 20th year in the industry um
00:03 - you know it would be sadly it would be a
00:06 - bit strange if I didn't have a little
00:07 - bit a burnout at this point right
00:13 - [Music]
00:43 - welcome back to the Freo Camp podcast
00:46 - I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of
00:48 - freecodecamp.org each week we're
00:51 - bringing you Insight from developers
00:53 - Founders and ambitious people getting
00:54 - into Tech this week we're joined by Suz
00:58 - Hinton she's a software engineer
01:00 - security researcher and she was one of
01:02 - the pioneers of live coding on Twitch Su
01:06 - how's everything going with you well
01:08 - it's going great thanks um I'm really
01:09 - excited to be on this podcast given that
01:11 - we've known each other for a while so
01:13 - yeah and this is like the first time
01:15 - we've actually had like a synchronous
01:17 - conversation I think we may have been on
01:19 - some podcasts together like guests on
01:21 - like JS party or some of these other
01:23 - podcast but I don't think that I've ever
01:26 - actually talked to you in real time back
01:28 - and forth like this no it's it's always
01:30 - been like email or again yeah it was
01:31 - with the gaggle of other people so yeah
01:34 - yeah well was so cool uh I am hyped to
01:37 - learn about you uh I'm going to be
01:38 - taking notes furiously as we go through
01:41 - this and uh I've already done a lot of
01:43 - research like rereading your awesome
01:45 - article that's on free C Camp about your
01:47 - live stream live coding setup and uh I'm
01:50 - going to be linking that and other cool
01:52 - things that Su mentions in the show
01:54 - notes but yeah let's let's get into it
01:56 - uh I always like to start with just
01:58 - giving people perspective and
02:00 - understanding your kind of origin story
02:03 - as a developer because you have like a
02:05 - really interesting twisting and turning
02:07 - whining path through Tech because you
02:10 - were in Tech very early and then you
02:11 - just went and basically did like every
02:14 - single sub area of tech over the years
02:17 - it seems like yeah we and and the other
02:21 - thing to note is I know I've been
02:23 - talking most of this podcast so if you
02:26 - heard some of what Sue said she does
02:28 - have a little bit of a non-north
02:29 - American accent she hails from Down
02:33 - Under yeah so you're based in
02:36 - Melbourne yeah that's right Melbourne
02:38 - Australia which is southeast kind of
02:41 - like on the way to Antarctica
02:44 - so so you can kind of stop over that's
02:47 - usually how I try and describe it yeah
02:49 - apparently yeah yeah and I had the
02:53 - pleasure of visiting Melbourne uh a few
02:56 - years ago for a conference and it was
02:58 - just I love that City my goodness I'm
03:00 - not sure if I'll ever go again just
03:02 - because it was a huge plane trip to get
03:04 - over there from California I mean like
03:07 - it was like a the longest flight I've
03:09 - ever taken was to Melbourne I think yeah
03:12 - but uh yeah like what was it like
03:15 - growing up in Australia and like what
03:17 - were your early Ambitions as a
03:20 - kid I loved going up here I think I was
03:24 - definitely somebody who felt very lucky
03:27 - very very lucky and we we used to sort
03:29 - of affectionately refer to our country
03:31 - as The Lucky Country just because we
03:32 - knew if you were born here that you
03:35 - already had a really good Head Start in
03:36 - life um wasn't a very ambitious person
03:39 - you know like I you know even just
03:42 - growing up I didn't have huge travel
03:44 - aspirations or anything so it is funny
03:46 - in the end that I ended up living in um
03:49 - in the United States for about 12 years
03:52 - um but yeah I just loved growing up here
03:54 - this city has gotten the world's most
03:56 - livable city award like years and years
03:58 - and years in a row um it's just it is
04:01 - actually an objectively good City even
04:04 - though I'm very biased because I was
04:05 - born and raised here but yeah um there's
04:08 - a reason why I'm living back here again
04:10 - right and I haven't chosen elsewhere
04:12 - so yeah well what did you like what were
04:16 - your early interests because I know like
04:19 - whenever I talk like you're like the
04:21 - third Australian I've interviewed for
04:23 - like the re recent recent history on the
04:25 - podcast and uh it sounds like like a lot
04:28 - of the technology that that we had in
04:30 - the states uh like a lot of like early
04:34 - Apple Computers uh Commodore 64 Amiga uh
04:38 - a lot of those computer like did you
04:39 - grow up did were you lucky enough to
04:41 - like have a computer in your home what
04:43 - type of gear were you working
04:46 - with yeah that's a great question so um
04:49 - I know that a lot of that stuff
04:50 - originated in America but it does kind
04:52 - of find its way to the I guess like
04:54 - secondary and tertiary markets so um my
04:58 - family growing up didn't have like a ton
04:59 - of money uh we I was very fortunate to
05:02 - to grow up middle class but it's not
05:04 - like we could afford to buy like the
05:06 - brand new computers um all the time and
05:09 - it was sort of hard to justify buying
05:10 - one back then um because it was you know
05:14 - the late 80s early 90s it was really
05:16 - only a few are very geeky about
05:18 - computers um this was pre- Windows and
05:20 - all of that so I was lucky enough to
05:23 - inherit a Commodore 64 from my uncle and
05:26 - mind you this was still this was the
05:28 - early '90s so we were starting to move
05:30 - into Windows 3.1 um but I didn't care
05:33 - that it was behind I didn't even know
05:35 - that it was a computer that was behind
05:37 - um but given that there's no sort of
05:39 - goey there's all you do is type into a
05:41 - prompt you know I I turned to my dad and
05:43 - said how do you you use this it looks
05:46 - cool but I don't know how to use it and
05:48 - so he showed me a few prompts uh he
05:51 - taught me a tiny bit of basic and then
05:52 - he just kind of left the the the
05:55 - computer manuals with me um and I just
05:57 - got really hooked straight away so I
05:59 - think that I was was lucky in that I did
06:00 - inherit an older computer because I had
06:02 - to sort of learn computers like the hard
06:04 - way um and so even when we moved into
06:07 - things like Windows 3.1 95 98 things
06:11 - like that I was still trying to code you
06:13 - know um regardless because I found that
06:16 - that was quite interesting yeah and was
06:20 - there anything that pushed you in like a
06:22 - creative Direction like were were there
06:23 - some applications that you were using
06:26 - that like really uh it what point did
06:30 - you start saying I want to learn more
06:32 - computers learn more computers more
06:34 - about computers and I want this to be
06:36 - like a thing that I do when I grow up
06:38 - did was that like in your mind at
06:41 - all yeah the last part was not in my
06:43 - mind at all I just thought it was a fun
06:45 - hobby like again I'm not very ambitious
06:47 - and so I just I was just like I like
06:49 - this computer so I'm going to keep
06:50 - playing with it but I think what really
06:53 - brought things home for me was once you
06:55 - once batch files were a thing in Windows
06:57 - and you can start automating things um
07:00 - that's when I got really excited because
07:01 - you know you can set things up so as
07:03 - soon as you log in to your account you
07:05 - can run a batch file and that batch file
07:07 - will you know pop up all the different
07:09 - programs that on games or like Windows
07:11 - Media Player or something and I just
07:13 - thought that was so cool that you could
07:15 - you know just script something like that
07:17 - um and then once I actually started
07:19 - getting onto the internet um I would
07:21 - catch the bus to my local library
07:23 - because we didn't have the internet at
07:24 - home um I just thought websites were so
07:27 - cool and I figured out that you can
07:30 - actually make them you know I found a
07:32 - book in the library for kids called your
07:34 - own website um I actually ended up
07:36 - finding a copy um years later for
07:39 - nostalgic reasons but I looked at it and
07:41 - I was like oh you just type stuff in
07:44 - notepad this is actually like way easier
07:47 - than I thought it would be and so I
07:48 - think my big moment was really learning
07:51 - how to use computers to do things for
07:54 - you so it was like the batch files but
07:55 - it was also making websites was just
07:58 - such a creative thing
08:00 - as a kid and then putting it on the
08:02 - internet being able to tell your friends
08:03 - they can go look at it at home as well
08:05 - you know there's something very magical
08:06 - about that experience especially back
08:08 - then when not a lot of your friends
08:10 - actually had websites or or you know
08:12 - were interested in that yeah yeah I mean
08:15 - you got to be like the first kid on the
08:17 - Block so to speak or one of the first
08:19 - kids in your class to to have their own
08:21 - web presence if you
08:23 - will yeah it was exciting it was like
08:25 - the late '90s and I just thought it was
08:27 - the coolest thing ever yeah
08:30 - yeah so like uh at what point did you
08:32 - start thinking about like School Beyond
08:35 - High
08:38 - School yeah I originally wanted to be a
08:41 - veter nurse um
08:44 - but I kind of just lost interest like I
08:48 - I really like animals but then I
08:50 - realized that it was going to be maybe a
08:51 - bit of a depressing job I think that
08:54 - unless you go on to become a full uh
08:56 - veterinarian you kind of don't have the
08:58 - nice jobs as vet nurse um so I sort of
09:01 - went back to the drawing board and I
09:03 - didn't really think of computers for the
09:05 - longest time until probably the last
09:07 - year of high school and I had never
09:10 - heard of computer science um I didn't
09:12 - hear of it until years and years later
09:15 - and so I'm just you know looking in the
09:17 - you had this big reference book back
09:19 - then uh in Australia of all of the
09:21 - different university courses you could
09:23 - take and so it was a physical book that
09:26 - you you you sort of like palmed through
09:28 - and I just kind of started looking up
09:30 - information technology and applying to
09:32 - random um universities that way but none
09:35 - of those courses were anything that I
09:37 - actually wanted to do so to be honest I
09:39 - was pretty lost and I didn't know if I
09:42 - could even get a job you know it was
09:44 - still just a hobby for me at that stage
09:45 - so I sort of locked out in the end I
09:47 - think yeah what did you end up doing
09:50 - like in terms of
09:53 - studies yeah so I got into like an
09:56 - information technology degree but it was
09:58 - going to be like a I think a 2 to 3 hour
10:01 - um public transport ride there and back
10:04 - so you know like 4 to 6 hours round trip
10:06 - every day I just figured out that that
10:08 - just wasn't feasible I wasn't ready to
10:10 - move out yet so um my mom actually saw
10:14 - like an advertisement in the local
10:15 - newspaper for a um I guess the
10:18 - equivalent in America is community
10:20 - college but here it's called ta which is
10:22 - tertiary and further education so it's
10:24 - more of a trade school um she found like
10:27 - an advertisement for like um multimedia
10:30 - it was a multimedia course it's now been
10:32 - renamed to interactive media and it just
10:35 - looked like everything I've ever wanted
10:37 - to do in one right it was like sound
10:39 - production and 3D modeling and um video
10:43 - and making interactive games and making
10:46 - websites and things like that so um just
10:49 - got just just kind of just a spur of
10:52 - the- moment thing we went down to the
10:53 - school and applied and it was past the
10:56 - deadline and everything but they
10:57 - actually let me in based on the websites
10:59 - I'd been making as a kid you know um so
11:02 - honestly it was just very serendipitous
11:04 - because that course that sort of twoe um
11:08 - associate of Arts sort of put me on a
11:11 - good pathway for me realizing that this
11:13 - might be a thing that I can do
11:15 - professionally yeah and what kind of uh
11:19 - skills did you walk out of that program
11:21 - with and like I don't want to gloss over
11:23 - the entire program because we've got so
11:25 - much to talk about but like while you're
11:28 - answering that question just like any
11:29 - other like interesting kind of
11:31 - discoveries you had about yourself or
11:33 - about technology during those two years
11:35 - uh getting your
11:38 - Associates yeah I think what I found was
11:41 - that as long as it was creative like it
11:44 - was as long as it was a you know using
11:45 - the computer in a creative sense I would
11:47 - just really latch on and get very
11:49 - engaged um with learning but the course
11:52 - was not really learning any programming
11:54 - there was a little bit of scripting and
11:55 - Flash but it was mostly just doing
11:59 - everything else but programming um which
12:01 - sort of gives you this huge grab bag of
12:04 - skills that I've been able to reach into
12:06 - over and over again over my career and
12:08 - also in my personal life as well you
12:09 - know especially the the sound production
12:12 - the video creation you know because
12:14 - we'll talk about that later but even
12:16 - just the 3D modeling you know that came
12:18 - in way more useful in my life than I
12:20 - thought it ever would um and so it was
12:23 - just good to learn a bunch of different
12:25 - things that I didn't even know was sort
12:28 - of you know a a path of expertise just
12:31 - to get a sample of everything so I sort
12:33 - of came out of that course as a very
12:35 - sort of well-rounded creative
12:37 - technologist I guess you could say yeah
12:40 - yeah that makes a lot of sense um and it
12:43 - sounds almost kind of like the
12:44 - equivalent of like going to like video
12:45 - game design school or something like
12:47 - that is yeah yeah there was actually a
12:50 - video game track that they opened up
12:51 - later on and I was really annoyed
12:53 - because they they released that like a
12:55 - year into my course and I was like oh do
12:57 - I switch to that one that seems so cool
13:01 - yeah well I mean you've described your
13:04 - uh your education as a quote unquote
13:06 - jack of all trades um and
13:10 - uh you know could you talk about why
13:13 - this process was like a big asset just
13:15 - having like such a grab bag of skills uh
13:18 - and like what your first jobs like what
13:21 - they were after you finished this
13:24 - program mhm yeah I think it definitely
13:27 - set me up for um my first couple of jobs
13:29 - I was just sort of taking contract work
13:31 - for a little bit and when you take
13:33 - contract work you know sometimes they
13:35 - will just ask if you um you know if you
13:41 - can do this or do that and they sort of
13:43 - try and sort of use as many skills as
13:45 - they can um and so it meant that I could
13:48 - just jump from contract to contract and
13:50 - not worry about the fact that I was like
13:52 - very Junior um because I could just sort
13:54 - of like use that jack of all trades to
13:57 - problem solve in in a lot of different
13:58 - cases
13:59 - and so for example you know one of my
14:01 - first jobs I was making Flash banners
14:04 - for like a major car company and just
14:07 - making cars Zoom around you know on and
14:09 - I was that person that made the annoying
14:11 - ad banners that you saw on the early
14:13 - internet which you know whenever you AR
14:15 - I'm quite
14:18 - ashamed cleaning of the
14:21 - industry yeah I was just thinking like
14:23 - so for people that don't know uh what
14:25 - sus is talking about like I just had
14:28 - these memories like certainly the early
14:31 - 2000s you you would arrive my kids are
14:34 - like yelling something in
14:36 - incomprehensible about Sour Patch
14:39 - Kids mom's coming to uh escort them away
14:42 - from the
14:43 - premise all right uh so what I was
14:46 - saying is um yeah like I remember you'd
14:49 - like arrive at like IGN or like some
14:51 - video game website and like you'd be
14:52 - like all right I can't wait to read this
14:54 - article like all this stuff starts
14:56 - popping out like all this animation and
14:58 - and of course your site like your
15:00 - internet connection starts chunking and
15:02 - everything is like super duper slow
15:04 - because this overly ambitious you know
15:06 - thing is like blocking your view of the
15:08 - article you're trying to read exactly so
15:11 - you were like developing that those
15:12 - kinds of things for like advertising
15:13 - agencies or who who were you working
15:16 - with yeah so that was me that was me
15:18 - making those annoying ads and they were
15:20 - particularly animation heavy back then
15:23 - just to get the people's attention uh it
15:25 - was the advertising agency Jay Walter
15:27 - Thompson that's who I worked for early
15:30 - in my career um and so yeah they one day
15:33 - they'd say uh we need you to do these
15:35 - flash banners and then another day that'
15:37 - say oh we have this um InDesign document
15:40 - that we're making into a PDF but we want
15:42 - you to add sort of some interactive
15:44 - hotspots in it do you know how to do
15:45 - that and then another time you know
15:47 - they'd be asking me to make this full-on
15:50 - sort of immersive video website that
15:53 - where the video sort of Blends in with
15:54 - the web page and it was it was very sort
15:56 - of futuristic back then um and so being
16:00 - being able to be on the video set as we
16:02 - were sort of filming and me having that
16:04 - background really helped me say yes this
16:07 - is something that I'll be able to blend
16:08 - in and just having all of these
16:10 - different pieces of um even though it
16:13 - was all very surface level obviously
16:15 - like Jack of all trades there was just
16:17 - these really nice instinctive moments
16:19 - where I could come in and and
16:21 - intuitively you know understand how
16:23 - something would be put together and in
16:25 - the advertising agency world that is
16:27 - just so bizarre are just really wild
16:30 - stuff happening all the time um thinking
16:33 - on your feate was very high highly
16:35 - valued at the time I
16:37 - guess yeah so a lot of people who are
16:40 - entering software development like the
16:42 - way I describe the free cocan podcast
16:44 - audience is like onethird developers
16:46 - one-third High School University
16:48 - students and onethird people who are
16:50 - working in other fields that want to get
16:52 - into software development maybe they're
16:54 - driving trucks maybe they are working as
16:57 - an accountant maybe they are uh just
17:01 - coming out of rehab or coming out of
17:03 - incarceration or any number of different
17:04 - things right maybe they're just getting
17:06 - out of like uh you know some sort of
17:08 - situation where they were previously
17:10 - like a stay-at-home spouse and now they
17:12 - have to reenter the workforce right so
17:15 - like like there's a wide variety of
17:17 - people and a lot of those people may
17:19 - have like skills from a past life like
17:22 - they used to work in uh one field or
17:25 - another like as a developer just
17:27 - day-to-day do you find yourself calling
17:30 - on all these kind of random skills that
17:32 - at the time may may have felt like I'm
17:34 - not sure if I'm ever actually going to
17:35 - use this in a professional capacity like
17:37 - have you have you found just like random
17:39 - things that you picked up to continue to
17:41 - be useful and helpful for getting things
17:44 - done yeah yes and no I think it greatly
17:47 - depends on what your profession is you
17:50 - know like I think that there'll be
17:51 - little random things that come in handy
17:53 - and obviously I can't comment on that
17:55 - because I haven't done a lot of those
17:56 - different careers but um um just things
17:59 - from time to time so for example you
18:01 - know I've never worked at a video game
18:03 - agency um and I've never you know had to
18:07 - do anything professional in that
18:08 - capacity but because we played with some
18:11 - of those physics a little bit in tap um
18:14 - I've being able to just you know
18:17 - intuitively understand when a certain
18:19 - animation needs to happen on a website
18:20 - when you're using CSS animations and
18:23 - like the the tweening or the key um you
18:25 - know creating the of just like drawing a
18:28 - blank what are they called the key key
18:30 - key frames no not yeah key frames is
18:34 - that like like when you're like
18:35 - animating something like you you kind of
18:37 - like yeah put the character in different
18:39 - shapes and then the software
18:41 - interpolates like what the animation is
18:43 - supposed to happen Okay M yeah I don't
18:46 - know anything about animation I just got
18:47 - lucky and knew that for that
18:49 - term yeah exactly and so that stuff came
18:52 - along for web pages like years and years
18:54 - and years later right like flash was
18:56 - already dead I thought okay I'm never
18:58 - going to use any of those skills over
18:59 - again um and then all of a sudden you
19:01 - know we had things like key frames and
19:03 - CSS and I'm like oh my God you know I
19:05 - can actually use that now or even when
19:08 - 3js came to um the web right um in
19:12 - JavaScript you know I was at a hackathon
19:14 - once and um somebody wanted to create
19:18 - this sort of like 3D lathing system and
19:20 - you know I already had some of the kind
19:23 - of theory on that even just like
19:24 - calculating the frost room and things
19:25 - like that and you know for actually
19:27 - programmatically creating it even though
19:29 - I'd never touched programmatic 3D
19:31 - modeling I had that you know intuitive
19:34 - background where I could figure things
19:36 - out and I sort of had that that that you
19:38 - know reasoning in order to problem solve
19:40 - so it hasn't come in handy all the time
19:43 - but it sort of surprises me when it does
19:45 - because it does tend to be quite
19:47 - spontaneous like that yeah yeah that's
19:50 - cool it sounds like this uh broad skill
19:52 - said has been very helpful so from
19:55 - developing uh you know banner ads and
19:58 - and other things that advertising
19:59 - agencies needed like like where did you
20:01 - move from there in terms of like the
20:03 - what was the next step step in your
20:06 - career yeah advertising was definitely
20:08 - not for me like if you've seen Mad Men
20:11 - um it's very much I love Mad Men I love
20:13 - I love that show we talk about it often
20:15 - it's like my favorite show of all time
20:17 - but I would never want to live in that
20:18 - world that's that's
20:19 - funny yeah exactly exactly it is funny
20:22 - that it's one of your favorite shows but
20:23 - yeah it it was very much like that right
20:25 - like every every agency is its own
20:27 - flavor of that depending on the decade
20:28 - and like you know there's just different
20:30 - different nuances to it it just wasn't
20:32 - for me I think I was there for maybe a
20:35 - year a year and a half or something I
20:36 - forget but I just wanted something a bit
20:39 - more
20:40 - quiet um and something that wasn't
20:42 - advertising it just didn't sit with me
20:44 - you know I just was like I don't like
20:47 - making these annoying things that people
20:49 - have to run into on the internet right
20:50 - it just didn't feel right so um I ended
20:53 - up just pivoting into different roles so
20:55 - I moved into e-learning next um I was
20:58 - actually teaching
20:59 - part-time um the back at the the tap the
21:03 - university that I studied at I went back
21:05 - to teach for 3 years to part-time so I
21:08 - just moved right into education actually
21:10 - so I was sort of I was doing QA and
21:14 - accessibility testing for a bunch of
21:16 - e-learning tools that are used in
21:18 - various ta institutions in Australia and
21:20 - then yeah I would then go in Moonlight
21:22 - as a teacher and so that was nice and
21:25 - then I just worked for a bunch of web
21:27 - shops right like consultancies and stuff
21:29 - before you know working for more SAS um
21:33 - companies later in the last in the sorry
21:35 - in the the second part of my career so
21:37 - far so it was just kind of stumbling
21:39 - around trying to find stuff that you
21:42 - know was was a bit more
21:45 - morally in line with what I wanted to
21:48 - work
21:49 - on yeah so you had problems with like
21:52 - working in the advertising agent agency
21:55 - industry if you will I mean that whole
21:57 - industry is based around like
22:00 - manufacturing desire of products that
22:03 - people don't necessarily need right
22:04 - getting them to spend money getting
22:05 - people going to De lots of products that
22:08 - are very bad for obviously Mad Men the
22:10 - whole the whole theme going through the
22:12 - entire Series this isn't a big spoiler
22:14 - because it comes up in the very first
22:15 - episode is cigarettes right like
22:17 - cigarettes are an unnecessary thing that
22:20 - are incredibly damaging to people like
22:23 - they're damaging to the environment
22:24 - they're damaging obviously to Public
22:27 - Health like uh a huge portion of my tax
22:30 - dollars that I pay are going to help
22:31 - people who smoked a bunch of cigarettes
22:33 - and are now need all this end of life
22:35 - care that's caused by that and you know
22:37 - like man like Don Draper the main
22:40 - character himself is like addicted to
22:42 - smoking and he can't quit and he just
22:44 - kind of like accepts that's that's one
22:45 - of the things I love about madman sorry
22:47 - to go off on a Madman tangent but like
22:49 - it was no I get it inconceivable that
22:52 - you could actually quit and he's just
22:53 - like really pissed off at the cigarette
22:54 - companies whom he's been benefiting from
22:56 - his entire career as an Advertiser
22:58 - advertising executive right um he's just
23:01 - upset like because he realizes like I'm
23:03 - hooked this is going to kill me and I
23:05 - can't quit like I I'm just going to be
23:08 - addicted to this for the rest of my life
23:09 - he feels like he's been hoodwinked
23:11 - essentially and it's like kind of like
23:12 - the it's like this angry chip on his
23:15 - shoulder throughout the series but um
23:17 - but yeah like I I can totally see like I
23:19 - have lots of friends who are in
23:21 - advertising and not everybody's
23:23 - advertising something as damaging as
23:25 - cigarettes but I can I can I can still
23:26 - see like maybe you could talk about that
23:29 - like don't worry about sliding the
23:31 - advertising industry just talk about
23:33 - like how you really feel about the field
23:36 - having worked in it like were there any
23:38 - moments where you really felt you look
23:40 - back and you regret doing certain things
23:42 - that you
23:44 - did yeah it's good because I I it's a
23:47 - good question because I did go in very
23:50 - naive right and the that was sort of the
23:54 - job to get back in the day if you um
23:57 - were kind of more on the creative side
23:59 - of software as well um and so it was so
24:02 - exciting you know I was competing with
24:04 - other graduates in my class for that job
24:07 - like we all wanted that job so badly and
24:09 - so to be honest you know I think there
24:12 - are a lot of parallels with that
24:13 - nowadays in certain jobs that seem
24:15 - really cool but might be a bit morally
24:17 - questionable um but that was my first
24:19 - experience with it really opened my eyes
24:22 - I don't know it was just working in
24:24 - advertising was really cool for a lot of
24:26 - different reasons it was very like
24:27 - fastpaced
24:29 - you know there were times when we were
24:30 - pulling all nighters to um Pitch to to
24:34 - win a certain account you know like
24:35 - there was this big Lottery account that
24:37 - we were trying to win and we made their
24:40 - entire pit into a huge game show in one
24:43 - of the meeting rooms so we converted one
24:45 - of the rooms into a massive game show
24:47 - and everyone had to dress up and you
24:49 - know and so I was being picked up at 4
24:51 - in the morning to come and work on the
24:54 - interactive PDF because you know that's
24:56 - when the designers actually finally
24:57 - finished the work went to bed right and
24:59 - then I got the phone call in the middle
25:00 - of the night and that's like really
25:02 - really bad right that's a very bad thing
25:04 - and we don't encourage that but that was
25:06 - sort of the adrenaline rush of working
25:09 - in advertising where sometimes you get a
25:12 - bit Stockholm syndrom in where you
25:14 - you're all in it together you know and
25:16 - so it's exciting and we might win the
25:18 - pitch and things like that and you sort
25:20 - of feel like you're part of something um
25:22 - and so I would say that it was just very
25:24 - mixed I wasn't always
25:26 - creating annoying crappy things
25:35 - were websites for um Brands as well
25:39 - where you know the the the the actual
25:41 - user had to want to go to the website
25:43 - they had to want to go to kelloggs.com
25:45 - or something and you know visit that
25:48 - website and so we weren't sort of
25:49 - annoying them in that way and so I would
25:52 - just say it was mixed but after I left I
25:56 - definitely regretted that I added to the
25:59 - advertising on the internet because I
26:01 - think that back then it was pretty
26:03 - simple there wasn't there was no such
26:05 - thing as tracking pixels and things like
26:07 - that at least when I first started but
26:10 - by the time I moved to the industry and
26:12 - I saw how much more creepy and
26:14 - manipulative advertising was getting
26:17 - that's when I started feeling
26:18 - embarrassed that I was sort of part of
26:19 - the beginnings of it if that makes
26:22 - sense yeah that totally makes sense
26:24 - because like adte advertising technology
26:27 - like being able like there have been a
26:29 - lot of breakthroughs and trying to
26:31 - successfully get you to part with your
26:34 - money really or or to make some sort of
26:36 - big purchasing decision on behalf of
26:38 - your company or whatever it is uh and
26:42 - the thing that uh it works right like if
26:46 - you go raise a bunch of venture capital
26:48 - and you have this war chest uh you can
26:51 - go out and you can pretty much
26:53 - guaranteed get customers through running
26:55 - Google ads or Facebook ads right and uh
26:58 - because there's just this big audience
27:00 - and you can go through and you can
27:01 - microt Target and you can ab test and
27:04 - you can just kind of use these different
27:05 - processes to arrive at an ad that will
27:08 - convert um were you involved in any of
27:11 - that stuff or did that that come later
27:12 - after you got out of the
27:14 - industry yeah thankfully I wasn't
27:16 - involved with that um and back then
27:19 - because internet speeds were so slow
27:21 - especially in Australia you know we were
27:23 - required to keep those flash banners
27:25 - really small like I submitted I uploaded
27:27 - one to you know the marketing platform
27:29 - once and I got a this was back in the
27:31 - day you had a phone on your desk too
27:33 - yeah like I would get a call from the
27:36 - guy at the marketing agency totally
27:39 - separate from the advertising agency and
27:40 - he'd be like yeah so your flash Banner
27:42 - was 16 kiloby but we needed to be
27:45 - 15 and so you know we we did have razor
27:49 - thin file size margins back then and
27:51 - that's quite hard to do when you have
27:52 - like a car asset and the jpeg background
27:55 - for it and a bunch of text and a bunch
27:56 - of key frames and things like that you
27:58 - had to get really creative you
28:00 - know yes yeah you had to get really
28:03 - creative asiz
28:06 - yeah sorry I didn't mean to interrupt
28:08 - you by the way like there's like a big
28:10 - time difference between Texas and
28:13 - Melbourne uh so if it seems like I'm
28:15 - interrupting Sue or if Su is taking a
28:17 - little longer to react like it's hard to
28:20 - get much farther around the earth than
28:22 - you and I are right now when we're
28:23 - talking to one another so I just for the
28:25 - sake of the audence I'm wide into the
28:27 - AET
28:28 - yeah yeah me too I've got like 500
28:30 - megabits like super duper fast internet
28:32 - you've got super duper fast internet the
28:34 - physical distance the packets need to
28:36 - travel is just so
28:37 - long so sorry anyway uh saying not that
28:41 - fast anyway um yes yeah so you know you
28:46 - really had to creatively optimize that
28:47 - kind of stuff and I felt that that was
28:49 - at least considerate right where you
28:51 - didn't want to encroach on the user you
28:53 - didn't want them to have to pay extra
28:55 - for like downloading extra stuffff junk
28:58 - and so back then um as well this was
29:02 - when I was doing this right when
29:05 - Facebook had just launched publicly
29:07 - right and I would say that Facebook has
29:10 - been responsible for a lot of the really
29:12 - creepy and really manipulative
29:13 - advertising right you know and I think
29:16 - that was sort of the dawn of the more
29:18 - sophisticated advertising the same with
29:20 - Google when Gmail came out and they
29:22 - started advertising on you know the
29:24 - AdSense the keywords and things it was
29:26 - right at the dawn of that so thankfully
29:28 - I didn't get to be part of that you know
29:30 - I'd left and it's not as if I saw that
29:33 - and thought I'm getting out I don't like
29:35 - it obviously it took me took us all a
29:36 - few years to really understand what was
29:38 - going on and and for those those really
29:40 - creepy tactics to come out um but yeah I
29:44 - was lucky enough that I sort of don't
29:46 - really attach myself to that but I just
29:48 - yeah still feel a bit dodgy while the
29:50 - same yeah so where do you go from there
29:53 - like like you've got these skills uh but
29:55 - you're kind of disenchanted with the
29:57 - industry that you're in so so you said
30:00 - you went back to school uh which is
30:03 - really cool by the way like going to
30:04 - teach I heard that you kind of even
30:06 - helped rewrite some of the curriculum
30:08 - that you yourself learned when you were
30:10 - at uh I'm going to get the the acronym
30:14 - wrong uh the Community College
30:16 - equivalent in t yes uh yeah
30:20 - like did teaching did that like fire you
30:25 - up did you enjoy teaching
30:29 - yeah I did actually I really enjoyed it
30:31 - um I'm not sure why I just really liked
30:34 - you I mean you you're the perfect person
30:36 - to talk to about this um you know you
30:38 - know when you get that you see that
30:40 - light bulb go off on in someone and you
30:43 - know you see them actually like really
30:45 - enjoy what they're learning and they
30:47 - feel like oh I can actually do this too
30:49 - and it's the same as like any hobby like
30:52 - I think any hobby that you do most
30:54 - people are very very happy to teach
30:55 - somebody else because just bringing them
30:57 - in and and sharing that Joy with someone
30:59 - is really really great so that was
31:02 - something that I think was what
31:04 - motivated me um to teach I wanted to
31:07 - spread the same joy that I felt when I
31:08 - sat down at the Commodore 64 for the
31:10 - first time um and I rewrote the
31:12 - curriculum mostly just because uh when
31:15 - we did our web design 3
31:18 - semester uh it was using a Microsoft
31:21 - access database and cold fusion
31:25 - and that was sort of starting to become
31:29 - uh just old Legacy kind of software and
31:33 - so I thought this isn't Preparing People
31:34 - for the workplace very well so I rewrote
31:36 - it in PHP and basically the um we did
31:40 - the wamp stack in the end so the windows
31:43 - uh Apache uh MySQL and um PHP stuck so I
31:49 - just rewrote the whole curriculum to do
31:50 - that and instead of creating um I forget
31:55 - what we actually made in that c fusion
31:56 - class but I said okay everyone's going
31:57 - to make a Blog and then you can use that
31:59 - also as your portfolio if you want when
32:01 - you graduate um because back then you
32:03 - had to actually show portfolios to get
32:04 - web jobs you weren't doing like leak
32:06 - code or hacker ranker or anything like
32:08 - that right um and so I just rewrote it
32:11 - to make it more useful for them when
32:12 - they graduated and I just thought that
32:14 - cold fusion and access was just not
32:16 - going to be the way going forward so
32:18 - that was the main reason why I rote it I
32:19 - just thought it would be more engaging
32:20 - that way yeah well I I do want to get to
32:24 - live coding uh before we get to live
32:26 - coding though um I mean again I'm trying
32:28 - to like piece together the chronology of
32:29 - your career in real time but uh but like
32:33 - teaching and live coding have got to be
32:35 - pretty related like those skills that
32:37 - you got helping light bu go off in
32:40 - people's heads like face to face and now
32:44 - you're jumping on Twitch and you're
32:47 - basically just coding live right there
32:49 - and like them and like showing people
32:51 - everything you're doing and explaining
32:53 - what you're doing and talking out loud
32:54 - thinking out loud and interacting with
32:56 - chat and stuff maybe you can talk about
32:59 - the process of getting into live coding
33:01 - what inspired you to first start doing
33:03 - it yeah for sure I mean I got inspired
33:06 - by the people that were doing it really
33:09 - early on so um Casey from hand handmade
33:12 - hero um he I think was one of the very
33:15 - very first to do it um but I think what
33:18 - gave me the boot up the bum so to speak
33:21 - to to actually try it myself was I had a
33:24 - friend who was doing um he was doing
33:26 - open source
33:28 - and he just I think he just did YouTube
33:31 - live or something like that I forget
33:33 - what he did but he just um I just don't
33:35 - want to put him on blast so I'm just
33:37 - giving him some privacy by not calling
33:39 - out who they are but um he just did some
33:42 - open source he's like hi you know I work
33:44 - on I'm helping to maintain pouch DB I'm
33:47 - just like you know I just need to do
33:48 - some open source work I just want you to
33:51 - show I just want to show people like
33:53 - what is it like to actually maintain
33:54 - open source cuz I think there's a lot of
33:56 - sort of misconceptions at the time know
33:58 - I think this was back in 2015 2014 there
34:00 - were just a lot of misconceptions about
34:02 - open source and contributing to it and
34:04 - you know a lot of people sort of put
34:06 - open source maintainers on a big
34:07 - platform and found them intimidating so
34:09 - he's just like oh just you know just sit
34:11 - and watch what I do for an hour and
34:13 - watch me flipping through issues and
34:15 - closing them out or replying to them and
34:17 - he was also just showing that there's a
34:18 - lot of drudgery in it it's not just like
34:20 - heroic coding and pushing up pull
34:22 - requests you know there's also just a
34:23 - lot of staring at something and figuring
34:25 - out if it is a bug or not or like
34:27 - answering somebody you know back and
34:29 - forth in an issue so I just thought that
34:31 - was really interesting I really
34:32 - appreciated it at the time because all
34:35 - of the open source stuff I did was so
34:36 - small and it was only me and so seeing
34:38 - someone maintain something big that
34:40 - everyone sort of had to collaborate on I
34:42 - thought was really interesting so I
34:43 - remember putting a comment on his
34:45 - YouTube video saying this is actually
34:46 - really
34:47 - cool maybe I could do the same for my
34:51 - embedded Hardware libraries because
34:52 - people are scared of those kinds of
34:55 - projects and maybe I can show people
34:57 - that it's really not a big deal it's
34:58 - just still JavaScript at the end of the
35:00 - day that you're writing so that was the
35:02 - kind of origin story of why I started I
35:04 - was literally like hey I found this
35:06 - useful maybe I'll do my own version of
35:08 - it that sort of sheds some of the
35:10 - intimidation factor for like a slightly
35:12 - different angle you know yeah and we
35:16 - didn't really even get into like your
35:18 - love of embedded development but like
35:21 - you've been very vocal about that um
35:24 - over the years like being really into
35:26 - like building things like physical
35:29 - Hardware like like uh you know I think
35:32 - you you had like the Ada of fruit like
35:35 - you know chip set of the month thing or
35:37 - something the box that they was in you
35:39 - that was so cool the monthly boxes yeah
35:41 - that was so cool yeah it fruit is like
35:43 - the raspberry pie company right like
35:45 - they they they ship out raspberry pies
35:47 - no that's element 14 but they do do they
35:51 - do make their own stuff yeah so they
35:53 - make their own boards and um things like
35:56 - that yeah ad fruit are amazing thing
35:57 - they based out of New
35:59 - York so and and you've got like quite a
36:02 - bit like I mean you're kind of blocking
36:04 - it in the frame for people who are
36:05 - watching the video they can see you got
36:07 - like a a detailed workbench like a
36:09 - pegboard is that like a some sort of
36:12 - like uh you know CNC machine or
36:14 - something or a 3D printer what is that
36:16 - big thing behind you the big boxy thing
36:19 - yeah yeah so that's a it's a 3D printer
36:21 - laser cutter and CNC machine in one um
36:26 - yeah it's really it's very big it's very
36:29 - heavy I had to actually um so I I bought
36:32 - that as an Ikea table you know with the
36:34 - legs and everything but I had to then go
36:37 - and buy a new tabletop like basically a
36:40 - huge slab of uh plywood from the
36:42 - hardware store and paint it just to be
36:44 - able to support the weight of it which
36:47 - is quite funny but yeah so um I am
36:50 - really interested in that I've always
36:51 - been interested in that and that's
36:52 - because of it again a teacher in my T
36:54 - course one day brought in an arcade
36:56 - cabinet that he built from
36:58 - scratch um and it was amazing it was
37:00 - like the sit down coffee table one and
37:03 - coil he showed us
37:05 - how yeah is that what they called a
37:08 - cocktail that's what they're called in
37:09 - the states like cocktail model it's like
37:11 - basically like Pac-Man or something
37:13 - where you got one controller on each
37:15 - side and the screen kind of flips
37:16 - depending on that's exactly what it was
37:18 - yeah yes yeah it was really cool um so
37:23 - he made one of those and he just asked
37:26 - people if they were interested to come
37:27 - in on a Saturday so we all came in on a
37:29 - Saturday and he just grabbed it out of
37:31 - the back of his car and he took the
37:33 - whole thing apart and showed us how it
37:34 - works and back then there was no
37:37 - Arduino so what you did was you took the
37:40 - circuit boards out of keyboards old
37:43 - recycled keyboards computer keyboards
37:46 - and then you just like kind of um hacked
37:49 - them and solded your own sort of uh
37:51 - wires to different you know parts of the
37:54 - keyboard Matrix and you use that to you
37:57 - know solder your joystick buttons and
37:59 - and things like that to the actual um
38:03 - yeah to the actual arcade machine and so
38:06 - you know he was showing us how to do all
38:08 - of this and he's like here's how to
38:09 - avoid all the ghosting problems on your
38:11 - keyboard because back then there were
38:13 - ghosting issues what is ghosting exactly
38:15 - I just thought that was
38:17 - the yeah so ghosting used to be a thing
38:20 - on um old school keyboards like the PS2
38:24 - connected keyboards where because like
38:26 - keyboards are sort of like on a on a
38:28 - circuit Matrix if you pushed certain key
38:31 - combinations too fast you'd either get
38:34 - the wrong keystroke or you wouldn't the
38:35 - keystroke wouldn't register I can't
38:37 - remember exactly just cuz I haven't
38:39 - needed this knowledge for a long time
38:40 - but it was called ghosting where you'd
38:42 - either get the wrong key press or you'd
38:43 - get like another different random letter
38:45 - because of um certain letters having
38:48 - certain uh or certain Keys having
38:50 - certain relationships in the electronic
38:52 - circuit um where it would just cause
38:54 - issues so um I guess cross wires so to
38:58 - speak so it was really interesting so he
39:00 - would he would show us how to kind of
39:01 - pick the different letters on the
39:03 - keyboard to avoid the ghosting issues
39:05 - when people were playing a video game
39:07 - cuz obviously that would be very
39:08 - frustrating so sorry that was a really
39:10 - long story but that was sort of how I
39:12 - got involved in it and I remember I
39:13 - started like I started collecting all
39:16 - these old keyboards I was that person
39:18 - that was like yes and then I'm going to
39:19 - make something with them these you know
39:21 - and then a few years later the Arduino
39:23 - came out and I was like oh this this is
39:25 - what we needed this whole time so then I
39:28 - went and did an Arduino course in Sydney
39:31 - um and the rest was kind of History I
39:33 - think this was 2006 2007 I did that and
39:36 - then I just started playing with
39:37 - embedded stuff like in my spare time for
39:40 - for basically every year since yeah and
39:43 - so like even today you still will like
39:45 - bust out like gear and just start
39:48 - Hardware
39:50 - hacking yeah so I don't have a lot of
39:52 - time these days just cuz I went back to
39:53 - UNI which we'll talk about later but um
39:55 - I still like make stuff like I'm just
39:58 - going to grab something don't judge me
39:59 - cuz I'm wearing my slippers cuz it's
40:01 - cold no worries and I'm going to
40:03 - verbally describe so she's got a big
40:04 - room she's walking across it uh she's
40:07 - got again this beautiful white
40:09 - workbench uh with like perfectly spaced
40:12 - and like like very deliberately planned
40:15 - out like where you're going to put your
40:16 - drill and where you're going to put all
40:17 - your different you know screwdrivers and
40:18 - stuff it's a really cool looking U
40:21 - backdrop uh so she's back in her chair
40:24 - cuz a lot of people like half the people
40:26 - watch yeah sorry sorry sorry I didn't me
40:27 - interrupt
40:28 - you no no go on I was just going to say
40:31 - cuz like about half the people that
40:33 - listen to like maybe a little more than
40:35 - half of the people will just listen to
40:36 - the audio Edition like I just listen to
40:38 - the audio Edition um I don't usually
40:40 - watch the video but for those of people
40:42 - who are watching the video Edition yes
40:44 - we do have a video Edition on YouTube
40:45 - you can go there and you can see what
40:47 - su's background is or if you've got like
40:49 - a a phot if you want to just snap a
40:50 - quick photo of it I can just throw it up
40:52 - in the show notes and people can like
40:53 - link directly to the photo um yeah she's
40:56 - given me the thumbs up so it sounds like
40:57 - we're going to have a cool workspace
40:59 - photo we might if you take a good one
41:01 - like and we can get it into a square we
41:03 - could even potentially put you at your
41:05 - desk on the Instagram because Freo Camp
41:07 - does have an Instagram it's about you
41:10 - know I don't know we've got maybe like
41:13 - several hundred images of people in
41:14 - their work workbenches and stuff so
41:17 - proud of it um but yes what' you grab
41:20 - show
41:21 - us yeah so I'm really lucky to have that
41:24 - space behind me by the way um so I'll
41:27 - just describe it again for the audio
41:28 - people this is something that I made
41:30 - years and years ago but I actually got
41:31 - it out recently just to repair it
41:33 - because it broke when you know one of my
41:36 - moves that I did um so it's supposed to
41:38 - be like a a a um one to one size replica
41:44 - of the metro card from New York City
41:47 - subway so it's like a train ticket and
41:50 - so the actual silk screen on the um
41:53 - circuit board is supposed to look
41:54 - exactly like it you've got the magnetic
41:56 - strip here which is Sil silk screened in
41:58 - like a big white strip um and so it's
42:01 - got like a little greeting card sticker
42:03 - that sorry speaker that you can take
42:06 - just out of one of those musical
42:07 - greeting cards um and it has like a
42:11 - little um 3D printed sort of like
42:14 - gramophone style sort of you know that
42:16 - horn shape yeah so it's just supposed to
42:19 - play Train noises that's literally all
42:21 - it does um but it it sort of shows the
42:25 - different skills that come together
42:26 - right and why have a 3D printer just so
42:28 - you can do that um and you know the
42:32 - soldering iron behind me you know I use
42:34 - that to actually repair it so the
42:35 - speaker actually broke off um and the
42:38 - wire snapped as well so I resolder that
42:40 - together glued this back down with a
42:41 - little bit of super glue and then it's
42:43 - it's good to go again so so that's just
42:45 - an example little things like that will
42:48 - it work right now yeah I don't know if
42:50 - you'll be able to hear it cuz it's very
42:51 - soft CU it's not an amplified speaker
42:55 - okay
42:57 - the cling doors
43:03 - please that's pretty cool yeah that that
43:06 - came through fine I think so it just
43:08 - does the you know stand clear of the
43:10 - closing doors and that was a noise that
43:12 - I heard every day in New York City when
43:14 - I lived there so it makes me very
43:15 - nostalgic
43:18 - yeah yeah and I love it like on the note
43:21 - of geeking out about mass transit I love
43:22 - mass transit whenever I go to a new city
43:24 - I love to like just take their train
43:25 - system around of course I live in a city
43:27 - that doesn't even have a train system
43:29 - unfortunately well technically we do
43:31 - it's just like I I've never used it
43:33 - before cuz it only goes in like to
43:35 - certain parts of town that I've never
43:36 - even been to basically like you can take
43:38 - it to get to like the the fairgrounds
43:41 - basically where they have this the Texas
43:43 - state fair with the giant cowboy guy Big
43:46 - Tex but that's it and I've never got an
43:49 - opportunity to write it anyway sorry for
43:50 - the the you know tangent about mass
43:54 - transit but yeah like
43:57 - so you're building things uh you're
43:59 - you're F you're feeling inspiration and
44:01 - you're just like you have the skills and
44:03 - you have the gear to be able to like 3D
44:05 - print things or use subtractive you know
44:08 - um technology like CNC to get metal into
44:11 - a certain shape that you need it um so
44:13 - you you have your own kind of Hardware
44:15 - lab that you can go into and get things
44:18 - done
44:20 - with yeah that's what I call it behind
44:22 - me the
44:25 - lab yeah are there so what's the most
44:28 - ambitious Hardware project you've worked
44:32 - on
44:37 - um this is going to
44:39 - sound unexpected but I it was actually
44:42 - when I was working
44:44 - for
44:46 - Microsoft um I was trying to I was
44:50 - working with like a
44:52 - medical medical equipment company for
44:55 - the hollow lens okay I guess that's mic
44:59 - the yeah yeah so I would say that that's
45:02 - embedded because it was like an actual
45:04 - kind of wearable device right and we
45:07 - were trying to um basically set up like
45:11 - the beginnings of what sort of live
45:14 - streamed 3D virtual experiences right so
45:18 - let's say we had something so the hollow
45:20 - lens is not like the um some of the
45:22 - other virtual reality headsets um
45:25 - although it's mixed reality everything
45:27 - all the processing was on the actual
45:29 - device so you didn't connect it to a
45:30 - computer like the Oculus or whatever
45:32 - right so it couldn't you know it didn't
45:35 - have as much power as something like an
45:37 - Oculus Rift uh and so if if something if
45:41 - we had to do like 3D manipulations or
45:43 - something like that that were like
45:44 - really really processor intensive we
45:46 - couldn't do it on the device so we were
45:48 - trying to figure out a way to um
45:51 - use like streaming technology um and I
45:55 - think we were trying to do it over
45:57 - RTC I think um and directex we were
46:01 - trying to figure out how to actually
46:03 - like have this very sort of zero latency
46:06 - you know like the sensors in the hollow
46:08 - lands would would transmit over that RTC
46:10 - channel the data Channel over to the
46:12 - server then the server would use
46:13 - directex to render the actual 3D view
46:16 - based on how you moved your head and
46:18 - then like whip it back to the machine to
46:20 - render as quickly as possible and so I
46:23 - thought that was probably one of the
46:24 - more challenging things that I've worked
46:25 - on because I had to like learn a I mean
46:27 - I'd never worked with RTC before um and
46:30 - I just had to just really think about
46:33 - how to optimize things as much as
46:35 - possible and just the concept of
46:37 - realtime streaming was sort of new back
46:39 - then you know I don't think stadia was
46:42 - was a thing and I don't think Amazon's
46:44 - version of game streaming was a thing so
46:46 - for us we were like is it even actually
46:48 - possible like are we going to achieve
46:49 - the latency we want without making
46:51 - people feel motion sick right with that
46:53 - sort of slight delay so I thought that
46:55 - was actually a really interesting
46:56 - project that I worked on
46:57 - yeah what was the result were you able
46:59 - to figure out a way to do it in a way
47:01 - that didn't make people emotion
47:04 - sick yeah so we were able to finish the
47:06 - Prototype and the job that I was in at
47:08 - the time that's all we kind of got to do
47:11 - yeah we're like here's the Prototype
47:12 - we've validated it and then you just
47:14 - kind of move on so I'm not sure what
47:15 - actually happened to that given that
47:16 - it's proprietary and sort of like not
47:19 - sort of public so yeah yeah you've
47:21 - worked at a lot of big tech companies
47:23 - and I will get back to live coding but
47:24 - like since you mentioned you're work at
47:26 - Microsoft you worked at like
47:31 - [Music]
47:56 - was like a funny thing that her sister
47:58 - had done she' worked at like all the
47:59 - different fan companies but
48:01 - uh what was your time as zos
48:05 - like yeah not a lot of people ask about
48:07 - that so I appreciate that um it was my
48:09 - first job in the US
48:12 - and I was moving to Las Vegas so like
48:15 - there weren't really a lot of places to
48:17 - apply for jobs there and I was just like
48:19 - I someone told me about Zappos because
48:22 - they're just being bought by Amazon
48:23 - they're not a thing in Australia you
48:25 - don't like order from zappos.com or
48:26 - anything and they're just like oh it's
48:28 - sort of a bit cooky there it's quite
48:30 - creative you know I think that it fits
48:32 - your personality you should totally
48:33 - apply and it was a total
48:36 - moonshot um but I managed to get a job
48:38 - there and I was there for almost 4 years
48:40 - and it was wild um probably one of the
48:45 - most formative jobs that I've had in my
48:46 - career just because of the timing of it
48:48 - and when it was good it was really good
48:50 - um a lot of the Amazon stuff started
48:53 - some of that culture started seeping in
48:54 - towards the end which was why I left
48:57 - but the first 2 or 3 years were again
49:00 - just really formative very influential
49:02 - on me the front end team there at the
49:04 - time was world class I mean like world
49:06 - class um you know they cared a lot about
49:10 - performance which is something that I'd
49:12 - never really had to um worry about in my
49:15 - career to a degree like I worked for
49:17 - mostly advertising Consulting so you
49:19 - just created a website for your client
49:21 - and then you handed it off and you never
49:23 - saw it again you know and they were very
49:25 - simple websites they weren't super
49:27 - JavaScript heavy maybe some Google Maps
49:30 - and that was about it um and so I hadn't
49:32 - really written a lot of JavaScript
49:33 - either so I wouldn't know the first
49:34 - thing about performance and so I learned
49:37 - so many things in that job and the
49:40 - front-end team were just so talented and
49:43 - so nice um and so inspiring and so I
49:47 - think that was when I went from just
49:50 - stumbling through my career to oh I
49:52 - actually want to be on this level I want
49:54 - to be at this caliber and it really sort
49:56 - of P me to improve a lot so um even just
50:00 - outside of the really cool culture of
50:02 - Zap where it's very creative or the
50:04 - meeting rooms really zany and you know
50:07 - the CEO uh at the time was was quite a
50:10 - character I just found it really
50:12 - inspiring because of the front-end team
50:13 - like they've really brought me up to the
50:15 - next level of
50:17 - skills yeah so
50:19 - it what was it like moving to the states
50:22 - I mean a huge proportion of the people
50:24 - listening to this podcast are from
50:26 - overseas and a lot of them would love to
50:28 - come and work for one of the big frankly
50:30 - like high-paying US tech companies
50:33 - because uh Americans may take this for
50:35 - granted that like tech jobs just pay a a
50:37 - lot of money uh often like a lot more
50:39 - than you know working in accounting or
50:42 - working in other not like non software
50:45 - engineering fields of engineering for
50:46 - example um but
50:49 - like moving to the US from Australia
50:52 - like there are lots of cultural
50:53 - differences even though you got the same
50:54 - language and everything like had you
50:56 - been to the US before you came to uh
50:58 - apply this was your first trip to the US
51:01 - really
51:04 - no um I'd been to I've been overseas
51:07 - once I went to venatu which is just an
51:10 - an island off the you know a few hours
51:13 - from the coast of uh Northeastern
51:16 - Australia no I'd never been to America
51:18 - um my partner scored a job in Nevada and
51:21 - so it was more just like we were going
51:23 - for his job but I quickly discovered
51:26 - that you can't just move to America like
51:28 - you sort of have to have a Visa and that
51:30 - usually means you have to have a job um
51:32 - and so that was the reason why I moved
51:35 - overseas um but yeah the I actually took
51:38 - a pay cut um because at the time like
51:41 - Nevada was really low cost of living and
51:44 - the front end engineers at zapo weren't
51:47 - valued in the same way they they were
51:49 - seen as less technical than the backend
51:51 - Engineers so we got paid a lot less than
51:54 - some of the other Engineers of the
51:55 - company they then corrected that a few
51:57 - years later but I took a pay cut
51:59 - actually to go work in America which I
52:01 - know is not the usual path but after
52:03 - that obviously like my the the jobs I
52:06 - got after that and especially at some of
52:08 - the larger tech companies obviously I
52:10 - started earning a lot more money there
52:11 - so it was a wild experience to go
52:14 - from you know being on a salary that I
52:16 - was relatively comfortable with but had
52:18 - to sort of budget carefully and things
52:20 - like that right and couldn't live
52:21 - outside my means to then being on
52:23 - salaries that were just almost
52:25 - uncomfortable for me me you know because
52:27 - I just thought it was so much money um
52:30 - really wild experience very challenging
52:33 - to get through the first set of
52:35 - immigration paperwork as well I wasn't
52:37 - prepared for that and that was quite
52:38 - stressful so for anyone who has that in
52:40 - mind that's something to expect how long
52:43 - did you live in the US
52:45 - total 12 years I think yeah did you get
52:50 - did you apply for like a green card or
52:52 - any sort of permanent residency or did
52:53 - you always have the plan to go back to a
52:57 - Australia yeah it sort of flip-flopped a
53:00 - lot when I first moved there it was only
53:02 - going to be for a year and then I
53:03 - thought I'll stay a few years but I'm
53:05 - definitely going back um and then I kept
53:08 - staying and I've been in some long-term
53:10 - romantic relationships over there right
53:12 - so if I was in a long-term relationship
53:14 - at the time I thought oh well this sort
53:17 - of has given me some incentive to
53:19 - actually stay um and so at some point
53:21 - you know I did start working on a Green
53:23 - Card application just to make things a
53:24 - bit easier for myself because it's
53:26 - really stressful to know that when you
53:28 - lose your job or if you quit you need
53:31 - one immediately or you have to basically
53:33 - Deport yourself um and I found that
53:35 - enormously stressful it was always a big
53:37 - thing in my head I felt like I couldn't
53:40 - really buy property or do anything
53:41 - permanent there until I had that
53:43 - permanent residency so I did actually
53:45 - spend a number of years trying and
53:47 - failing to get a green card it's not as
53:48 - easy as it sounds and some people just
53:50 - have a much harder time than other
53:52 - people sometimes it's just really bad
53:53 - luck but I never really got there so for
53:56 - that entire 12 years I was sort of
53:58 - precariously on a a work visa but I
54:00 - think that's very normal for people from
54:03 - um countries like India where the Green
54:05 - Card applications are oversaturated in
54:07 - for their quota um so it's not as if you
54:10 - know that's a unique experience I know
54:12 - some people that are waiting you know 20
54:14 - to 30 years for their green card so um I
54:17 - don't want to trivialize that either but
54:19 - I was in a similar situation where I
54:20 - just felt like I kept running into dead
54:22 - ends or you know the pandemic happened
54:25 - which put a hold on a lot of um Green
54:28 - Card applications I know that right now
54:30 - because of all the layoffs in Tech most
54:32 - companies have to pause their Green Card
54:34 - applications for everyone because the
54:36 - Market's too saturated with um American
54:38 - citizens so uh because of the process
54:41 - you can't justify hiring somebody from
54:43 - overseas so it's it's just a very
54:45 - fraught process um but I did try uh to
54:49 - get there it just didn't happen so yeah
54:52 - yeah I mean how do you feel I mean it's
54:56 - not too back too bad of a fallback plan
54:58 - moving to the world's most livable City
55:00 - where you happen to also have grown up I
55:01 - was going to say yeah yeah I come from a
55:04 - lot of privilege and so you
55:06 - know there was a point where I realized
55:09 - that it wasn't worth all the trade-offs
55:11 - but also I come from an an amazing
55:15 - country and so you know having that up
55:17 - my sleeve was always something that was
55:19 - obviously very comforting for me so yeah
55:21 - that helped a lot thank you for bringing
55:23 - that up yeah uh so
55:26 - again you worked at a lot of big tech
55:28 - companies you got to like learn
55:30 - JavaScript from people who were
55:33 - underappreciated by you know
55:57 - do you know when you started actually
55:58 - live coding 2016 I think I think 2016
56:02 - yeah yeah something like that um yeah no
56:05 - I just gave it a go and I just told a
56:07 - couple of people on social media and my
56:09 - family I was doing it and I think like
56:11 - three to five people showed up for that
56:13 - first one and uh I remember rehearsing
56:16 - it the night before cuz I was so nervous
56:18 - to Live code um I was like oh I need to
56:21 - actually have some idea of what I'm
56:22 - doing otherwise I'm just going to like
56:24 - draw a massive blank so uh yeah that was
56:28 - sort of when I started and then I ended
56:30 - up just finding it a really good excuse
56:33 - to work on open source task that I
56:34 - needed to do but I didn't really feel
56:36 - like doing so that's kind of why it
56:37 - continued I was like oh this is actually
56:39 - like really helpful for me and hopefully
56:41 - if people watch that's a bonus so that
56:43 - was sort of how I got started with it
56:45 - yeah and maybe you can talk about what
56:47 - like a typical session would be like
56:51 - when you sat down and I realized that
56:53 - you haven't streamed in like 3 years if
56:55 - you go to to noop cat twitch.com
56:59 - noat uh which is your your old handle n
57:02 - o o p k a t I believe um y yeah uh
57:09 - there's it just there's like literally
57:10 - nothing there it just says last streamed
57:12 - three years ago and there's no like
57:15 - video on demand it's like it and I went
57:18 - there and I was just like I really
57:20 - wanted to watch your old streams in
57:21 - preparation for this but I don't I don't
57:23 - know if any of those were preserved
57:24 - anywhere is it just lost time or do you
57:26 - have like some hard drive with all
57:30 - the they're all on the hard drive um so
57:34 - I was very diligent about backing them
57:36 - up and things like that so they're not
57:37 - lost of time they're just not online so
57:40 - yeah yeah well um what was it like like
57:43 - the you did it for a few years I think
57:46 - uh like do you remember how regularly
57:49 - you were like how it progressed um just
57:51 - what the experience was like cuz live
57:53 - coding is seeing kind of a Resurgence
57:55 - like I was just talking with the
57:56 - primagen like last week and uh he he's a
58:00 - YouTube or he he records on Twitch and
58:04 - then he takes it chops it up and has an
58:06 - editor that puts it onto YouTube and
58:08 - he's very um I think deliberate about
58:11 - how he approaches it but
58:14 - um you know the way that you were doing
58:16 - it was it when I when I watched it back
58:19 - in the day it felt very very different
58:21 - vibe it was much more chill uh much less
58:24 - like social commentary
58:26 - it was much much more just like a a love
58:29 - of The Craft and just like focusing on
58:31 - the code I didn't it didn't seem like
58:33 - there were nearly as many memes or
58:34 - inside jokes or anything it just seemed
58:36 - very wholesome is that how you remember
58:39 - it yeah that's that's how I remember it
58:41 - I think it was different days back then
58:43 - but also I think I had different
58:45 - motivations but I don't want to speak
58:46 - for the other streamers so I W elaborate
58:48 - on that I just think that I came in with
58:49 - it with those different motivations I
58:52 - only did it once a week which is not
58:54 - something that twitch really likes to do
58:56 - they want you to do it more often but I
58:58 - just knew that that was sustainable 2
58:59 - hours every Sunday morning was when I
59:01 - did it um and I usually so for the first
59:05 - few I would just pick a feature I wanted
59:07 - to implement in a open in an open source
59:09 - library then after that I was like I
59:11 - need to make this even more sustainable
59:13 - for myself and enjoyable and so that I
59:14 - don't have to spend hours grinding
59:17 - before you know to figure out what I
59:18 - want to do I would just literally like
59:20 - roll out of bed put clothes on put a put
59:22 - a little bit of makeup on and then show
59:25 - up and say all right let's look through
59:26 - the issues and maybe the night before if
59:28 - I was particularly drawing a blank on
59:30 - like I don't even know what I'd work on
59:32 - I'd go through the issues and you know
59:34 - on one of my repos and and sort of think
59:36 - okay has someone opened a poor request
59:39 - sometimes someone would actually open a
59:40 - PO request the night before and I could
59:42 - tell they would hoping I'd review it on
59:45 - the stream so you know I tried to sort
59:47 - of look for something to prioritize um
59:49 - you know as far as that went so it was a
59:51 - very different vibe um we did have only
59:53 - a couple of inside jokes but they
59:55 - weren't sort of
59:57 - we would always explain them and you
59:59 - know we they were very subtle anyway um
60:02 - and so it was just it was supposed to be
60:04 - cozy time it wasn't my intention I never
60:07 - really designed My Stream in to be a
60:09 - certain way I just wanted to show up be
60:11 - myself not be a character get some work
60:13 - done you know that kind of thing so yeah
60:17 - and it was practical in the sense that
60:19 - you were actually working on real stuff
60:20 - that you'd be interested in working on
60:21 - like even if you weren't streaming uh
60:23 - open source
60:26 - yeah yeah pretty much what role has open
60:28 - source played in your career and in your
60:32 - life a lot yeah I actually feel really
60:35 - bad because I when I so I streamed for 5
60:39 - years and then I decided to just sort of
60:41 - step away um from it for a lot of
60:44 - different reasons um you know none of
60:46 - them were like really negative reasons
60:47 - or anything and I stopped working on
60:50 - open source too it's like I didn't have
60:53 - that sort of reason to get up and do it
60:54 - on the weekend so I feel bad I have
60:57 - stepped away from that a bit it is
60:58 - something I want to get back into this
60:59 - year um but it's had a huge impact on my
61:03 - life um in a lot of different ways and
61:05 - it's again it wasn't something that I
61:07 - designed I did open source because I saw
61:09 - other people around me doing it and I
61:11 - thought it was a really cool just
61:12 - Concept in general right and I thought
61:14 - it was again it was just a a very
61:17 - admirable um thing to do and I wanted to
61:20 - be sort of part of that and contribute
61:22 - you know my perspective on embedded
61:25 - software and things like that and and
61:27 - you know it's a really lovely way to
61:29 - meet a community um and hopefully
61:31 - Inspire other people too and so but
61:34 - through that you know I accidentally got
61:35 - introduced to all sorts of employment
61:37 - opportunities and even the live coding
61:39 - you know I had a couple of years in in
61:43 - developer relations as a result of that
61:45 - because people saw my stuff and reached
61:47 - out and wanted to hire me and so there
61:49 - was a lot of unintentional benefits to
61:50 - it a lot of amazing privileges that I
61:53 - don't think I would have foreseen that I
61:55 - know that some people we're getting into
61:56 - streaming now they do it with the aim of
61:58 - achieving those things because they can
61:59 - see that it's possible but it was very
62:02 - surprising to me how much the stuff I
62:05 - was just doing for myself ended up sort
62:08 - of being noticed by other people and and
62:10 - and opened a lot of doors for me that I
62:12 - didn't necessarily um you know plan for
62:15 - which is awesome but it's been mostly
62:16 - jobs and just meeting new people and
62:18 - being able to speak at conferences and
62:20 - all sorts of stuff
62:23 - yeah well I want to talk a little bit
62:26 - about like more recently since you
62:28 - stepped away from live coding uh you
62:30 - know recently you've gone and you've got
62:33 - like a whole lot of different CompTIA
62:35 - certifications you went back and you got
62:37 - like a proper like four-year degree from
62:40 - Western Governor's University where Bo
62:42 - K's studied where several people who've
62:44 - been on the free cocam podcast got their
62:46 - undergrad in uh computer science uh
62:49 - maybe you can talk about like the back
62:51 - to school back like hitting the books
62:53 - again because you had like this pretty
62:55 - you were really high up in your career
62:58 - and from the outside from my perspective
63:00 - it sounds like you're like hey I want to
63:02 - climb down this ladder and I want to go
63:04 - climb up this ladder like this perched
63:06 - against a different bookshelf almost
63:08 - that that's kind of how I view it is
63:09 - that an accurate representation what was
63:11 - going through your mind you didn't want
63:13 - to like just stay in this one field
63:17 - okay sort of um I think that I see
63:20 - school in a different way to most people
63:22 - do I know that school is or school I
63:25 - guess college or university I know that
63:28 - it's very heavily um focused on like
63:32 - workplace career finding a job things
63:34 - like that um but I love learning and I
63:38 - love having a structured learning
63:40 - environment and because I had such an
63:42 - amazing experience with that tap course
63:44 - I just it just really engaged me um I
63:48 - still wanted to actually go and get a
63:50 - full degree so that is what's called an
63:52 - advanced diploma here um in interactive
63:55 - media that's what I technically have but
63:57 - it's not the same like I always felt
63:59 - like I missed out because I just like
64:01 - didn't end up going to college and
64:03 - getting an actual degree I just felt
64:05 - that that is a an experience for me that
64:08 - I would just really cherish and enjoy
64:10 - and and it had nothing to do with a
64:12 - career or anything like that it's just
64:14 - it felt like such a luxury Indulgence
64:18 - almost to be able to go to a place that
64:21 - is catering for you to learn things
64:23 - there are experts there that you can
64:25 - talk to to and it is a structured
64:27 - environment so that you understand what
64:31 - you you don't have to figure out what
64:33 - you don't know because a lot of the time
64:34 - you don't know what you don't know right
64:36 - and so someone is giving you that
64:38 - syllabus and saying here are the things
64:39 - that we think it's important for you to
64:41 - know and again that just felt like this
64:44 - huge Indulgence to be able to do and so
64:46 - I've been dreaming about going back to
64:48 - college for years and years and years
64:49 - and so cyber security was something I
64:51 - was really interested in but felt very
64:53 - intimidated by how broad and how huge
64:55 - and how deep it can go so I wanted to
64:58 - have that sort of expertise to sort of
65:01 - lead me and and give me the foundations
65:04 - I guess
65:06 - yeah what did you do like like describe
65:09 - kind of your path into cyber security
65:11 - from a more you know jack of all trades
65:15 - software developer type
65:19 - background yeah I think cyber security
65:21 - just kept coming up again and again and
65:23 - again um I think obviously it's become
65:25 - like a huge problem right like we've
65:27 - actually seen sort of the um the growth
65:30 - of things like ransomware and scammers
65:32 - and you know whing that even in the age
65:34 - of of you know generative AI now that's
65:36 - another tool that scamers are using it
65:38 - just kept popping up again and again and
65:40 - again and every time it popped up for me
65:41 - I just got like really excited um
65:45 - because I just thought it was really
65:46 - really fascinating and so you know I did
65:50 - OS training at uh zapo which I now know
65:54 - is a privilege that most workplace don't
65:56 - give their software Engineers they just
65:59 - expect you to know but when I started it
66:01 - was mandatory that I did an OAS training
66:03 - that was held on site at zapo and that
66:05 - was my first introduction actually to
66:08 - just hacking and threat actors and uh
66:11 - how you can manipulate websites to you
66:13 - know to gain things and that just blew
66:16 - the top off the lid off my brain you
66:19 - know and I was like this is just
66:21 - ridiculously cool I've never thought
66:23 - about software in this adversarial way
66:26 - and I was just obsessed um and so you
66:28 - know for years after that I just kept
66:31 - sort of reading different books you know
66:33 - I'd read like uh books such as cuckoo's
66:36 - egg which is an amazing sort of you know
66:38 - dramatized reenactment of um of you know
66:41 - something that happened at Berkeley um
66:44 - in
66:45 - California it was so cool and then stuck
66:47 - net I read about stuck net and I was
66:49 - like oh my God that's so cool um and so
66:52 - I just it just kept coming up as a
66:54 - reoccurring theme and with embedded iot
66:57 - stuff you know that iot devices are
66:59 - riddled with software um security issues
67:02 - and so it just kept popping up again and
67:03 - again and again in my career and and I'm
67:06 - interested in it enough on a personal
67:07 - level that I decided to go to school
67:09 - right just to actually finally learn
67:11 - what I could about
67:13 - it yeah and you also earned some
67:17 - certifications which I think is worth
67:18 - noting because a lot of people out there
67:20 - listening to this may be thinking about
67:21 - getting like some like the Security Plus
67:24 - or network Plus or some of I think
67:26 - they're all CompTIA certifications there
67:28 - may be some additional certifications
67:30 - from other vendors can you just like
67:32 - quickly rattle off some of the
67:33 - certifications you've earned over the
67:35 - past few years and what you learned from
67:37 - them what they involve for people that
67:40 - might be interested in getting
67:42 - them so just a disclaimer um all of
67:45 - those certifications were requirements
67:47 - for my bachelor degree in cyber security
67:49 - so WGU like puts a big sort of heavy um
67:53 - focus on getting indust
67:56 - certifications um which you know a lot
67:58 - of Industry actually recommends that
68:00 - students get that's what they desire in
68:02 - new grads especially cyber security new
68:04 - grads so I got um A+ I've always wanted
68:07 - to get my comper A+ actually and I I was
68:10 - so emotional when I finally got it um so
68:12 - A+ Network plus Security Plus um cyber
68:16 - analyst plus pentester plus um I got the
68:21 - um there were a bunch of other ones that
68:24 - I I ass squ
68:27 - um I think like
68:31 - secure it's basically the is ISC squ
68:34 - equivalent of Security Plus I feel so
68:36 - bad cuz now I can't remember them off
68:38 - the top of my head I also got project
68:39 - plus which is a project management one
68:41 - which was I actually found really
68:43 - interesting uh a lot of people hated
68:44 - that one but I thought it was useful
68:47 - because project management is useful in
68:48 - any kind of capacity right whether
68:50 - you're planning to move cities whether
68:52 - you're like you know writing software
68:53 - right so I found that really helpful
68:56 - so yeah just a whole bunch of them there
68:58 - were more I've just forgotten them so
69:01 - yeah and yeah the experience was really
69:03 - good what was the experience like like
69:06 - you just studied did you actually have
69:07 - to report to a physical testing center
69:09 - and like take a test with like some
69:11 - somebody standing over you to make sure
69:13 - you didn't
69:14 - cheat for one of them I had to um and
69:18 - that was the ISC squ one because they do
69:20 - like a palm vein scan to make sure that
69:23 - you are the identity you're saying w you
69:26 - are and I got sort of searched and I had
69:28 - to put my glasses on a tray and that to
69:29 - spin the glasses around to make sure
69:31 - that they weren't augmented glasses it
69:32 - was really
69:34 - intense but the the rest of them I
69:37 - actually did Via online proctoring and
69:39 - that's because I was doing that bachelor
69:41 - degree during the pandemic so CompTIA
69:43 - had actually pivoted to allowing people
69:46 - to test from home um so I don't know if
69:49 - that's still an option but it definitely
69:51 - was during the pandemic where they would
69:52 - install basically spyware software on
69:54 - your computer which sucked um and then
69:57 - you had to quit everything you had to
69:58 - show the Proctor that you weren't
69:59 - running any like cheating software or
70:01 - anything and then you would do your exam
70:04 - on the computer at home so I was lucky
70:06 - that I didn't have to find a testing
70:08 - center for most of them because I think
70:09 - that just adds extra stress yeah and uh
70:14 - so you finish the degree you finish
70:18 - these certifications you're going back
70:20 - into the job market but this time not as
70:23 - a general software engineer frontend
70:26 - developer like all the different things
70:27 - you were doing before but as an actual
70:30 - security researcher what was that
70:32 - process like and you know what was it
70:35 - like kind of assuming that new role
70:40 - and yeah it was really cool I think that
70:43 - um what gave me a soft Landing was that
70:46 - it was still a software role but I was
70:48 - just moving over to work for a research
70:51 - team um and so I'd be working with data
70:53 - scientists and um actual researchers
70:56 - with phds right in cyber security and
70:59 - things like that um and so it was more
71:01 - sort of a soft move over there and I got
71:04 - noticed because you know I was putting
71:05 - all these certifications on my LinkedIn
71:07 - and I was I was doing a security lead
71:11 - position at stripe at the time too so I
71:12 - was sort of trying to cut my teeth on
71:14 - more security focused roles so I sort of
71:16 - tried to just subtly transition and take
71:19 - on more and more in my current job and
71:21 - that's sort of what got me
71:23 - noticed um by my boss at crowd strike
71:27 - who actually cold reached out to me um
71:30 - and said would you be interested in you
71:33 - know applying for this specific job in
71:34 - research and it was threat hunting
71:36 - research specifically and so but when I
71:40 - joined um so I ended up applying getting
71:42 - the job and I joined crowdstrike and I
71:45 - can tell you that the bachelor's degree
71:48 - made my job so much easier even though I
71:51 - was still writing software I understood
71:53 - why I was writing things I knew how to
71:55 - use all the language and the words with
71:57 - the researchers and I could talk to the
71:59 - threat hunters and they'd mention like a
72:01 - hacking tool you know um they'd mention
72:04 - something like blood hound or they'd be
72:06 - talking about Mimi cats or something and
72:09 - like I knew exactly the even just the
72:11 - context of what that you know particular
72:13 - intrusion was that we were looking at um
72:15 - and that my software was trying to
72:16 - surface and so it was huge um it made me
72:20 - feel like I didn't just do that degree
72:23 - for my own enjoyment it ended up really
72:26 - just making my job much more fulfilling
72:28 - because I didn't feel intimidated and I
72:30 - I understood everything that was going
72:31 - on so that was a really really lovely
72:34 - transition that I made in my career
72:37 - where everything just lined up really
72:39 - nicely and you know the because I went
72:42 - so deep on all of the you know things in
72:46 - my bachelor degree I didn't just do
72:48 - things to pass exams I really engaged
72:50 - with things I played with the tools I
72:52 - really studied the certifications not
72:54 - for the certification but to actually
72:56 - learn something from the certification
72:58 - it ended up just being such a huge
73:00 - reward when I actually moved into a
73:02 - position like that yeah so it sounds
73:04 - like you're pretty happy with the
73:06 - transition
73:07 - like was it all sunshine and rainbows or
73:11 - like is the grass always greener on the
73:14 - other side like like what was it like
73:16 - being an actual security researcher
73:18 - working I mean you were working you say
73:20 - oh I took I cut my teeth on a job at
73:22 - stripe as a security leader uh what was
73:25 - it I mean that sounds like the type of
73:27 - job yeah I was the lead of my team yeah
73:30 - yeah but but like yeah it was it it was
73:33 - really more of a security Champion like
73:35 - you know there were security Champion
73:37 - programs in um different software
73:39 - companies where I was the tech lead of
73:41 - my actual team um of my software team
73:44 - but then everyone like the security team
73:47 - at stripe I did not work for the
73:48 - security team they wanted every team to
73:50 - kind of have a security lead so that
73:52 - were the representative for making sure
73:54 - that we were doing all the right things
73:55 - and that everyone was educated on the
73:57 - team when it comes to like good security
73:59 - practices and things like that just
74:00 - because otherwise they Spread Way Too
74:02 - Thin so that was where I could say I was
74:04 - cutting my teeth on something that was
74:05 - not super high responsibility but gave
74:08 - me an excuse to engage with the security
74:10 - team too and just like use the actively
74:13 - use the knowledge that I was studying in
74:15 - the bachelor's so that was it was
74:17 - actually one of the best transitions
74:19 - I've ever had in my career honestly like
74:21 - it just everything was just so lucky
74:24 - like when I moved over to crowd strike
74:26 - uh they write a lot of their software in
74:28 - go in goang and I learned goang at
74:31 - stripe and so the transition just could
74:33 - not have been nicer um especially given
74:36 - it was a remote job I was the only one
74:38 - in Australia working for that team at
74:41 - crowd strike so I really had to be quite
74:44 - self-sufficient even when I was ramping
74:46 - up because there wasn't always someone
74:48 - available to help me at the during the
74:50 - time zone um you know non overlaps I
74:53 - guess yeah is is crowd strike an
74:55 - American
74:57 - company sorry I know this is like a
74:59 - super ignorant question I could have
75:00 - just Googled but like uh pretty much
75:02 - every big company you worked at it
75:04 - sounds like has been an American company
75:06 - so you've always had to deal with the
75:08 - like I guess since you moved back to
75:09 - Australia you've always had to deal with
75:11 - this like substantial time difference I
75:14 - mean it's incredible time difference
75:15 - like I'm getting ready to put my kids to
75:17 - bed and you're literally waking up and
75:18 - it's like 8: a.m. there and you're
75:20 - you're kind of getting started with your
75:21 - day uh yeah so you had to learn a did
75:26 - you do a lot of this asynchronously do
75:28 - you think that a lot of your experience
75:29 - doing open source and doing
75:30 - communicating through GitHub issues and
75:32 - pquest and stuff was that helpful just
75:34 - having that experience communicating
75:37 - through open source for working remotely
75:40 - at an American company from
75:43 - Australia yeah 100% actually I've never
75:45 - drawn that link before that's very ex um
75:49 - that definitely helped me just being
75:50 - comfortable with asynchronous stuff and
75:52 - going to bed you know having left a
75:54 - message for someone and knowing that
75:55 - when you wake up in the morning they
75:56 - will have responded and just learning to
75:57 - be patient absolutely that was very
76:00 - helpful and um yeah I guess I've never
76:02 - thought about it before but that was
76:03 - very um very very similar experience um
76:07 - and you know in in open source sometimes
76:10 - you're just like well I'd open an issue
76:12 - but what if I just go splunking through
76:13 - the code base maybe I'll actually be
76:15 - able to find the issue and fix it myself
76:16 - and save everyone some time and then
76:18 - just open a poor request it's that same
76:20 - kind of thing where sometimes I'd have
76:22 - questions and I'm like screw it you know
76:24 - it's it's um like I would work from 7:00
76:26 - a.m. my time till 3:00 p.m. uh my time
76:30 - just to get a bit more overlap with
76:31 - people in the states um you know I
76:33 - willingly did those hours but once you
76:36 - got to like noon my time I was like well
76:39 - I'm just going to smun through the
76:40 - source code because there's no
76:41 - documentation CU we're a research team
76:43 - you know we just have a lot of ephemeral
76:45 - stuff that we can't always be
76:46 - documenting so I'll just jump into the
76:49 - code base so yeah I think it was a very
76:50 - similar approach to that that it was to
76:52 - open source yeah how do you feel about
76:55 - like real-time communication tools like
76:57 - slack and things like that versus you
77:00 - know asynchronous communication like
77:02 - email and I guess ircc is more like
77:06 - slack but like uh systems where you
77:09 - communicate through the system like you
77:11 - open a ticket as opposed to just B you
77:13 - know jumping in and immediately talking
77:15 - to somebody in slack or something like
77:17 - that like do you do you think that what
77:19 - are your thoughts on that synchronous
77:22 - versus asynchronous question
77:25 - yeah I I don't like asynchronous at all
77:29 - um slack stresses me out but I think
77:31 - that's the case for just about everybody
77:33 - um I prefer real time at all times
77:37 - honestly um unless you know unless you
77:41 - need time to think so what was really
77:43 - nice was you know like obviously slack
77:45 - and emails and everything and meetings
77:46 - would all fall off at a certain point of
77:48 - my day so I would get a lot of focused
77:51 - time so I think asynchronous
77:52 - communication is really great for that
77:54 - where you don't
78:26 - [Music]
79:08 - [Music]
79:25 - you know my peers when I was studying
79:27 - cyber security um and so I took part in
79:30 - a lot of Collegiate ones actually so
79:32 - once for students so it's not as
79:34 - difficult um but also you can kind of
79:36 - Benchmark yourself against your your
79:38 - peers so I did a number of ctfs um which
79:42 - I really enjoyed uh it just gives you a
79:44 - chance to apply your skills and to see
79:48 - kind of where you're at and what you
79:50 - need to improve at and so yeah CTF
79:52 - stands for capture the flag and it's
79:54 - really just they're sort of just hacking
79:56 - challenges um sometimes your job is to
79:59 - defend something or to be um someone who
80:03 - reverse Engineers something so you're
80:05 - sort of on the the good guys side and
80:07 - then sometimes the um CTF events are
80:11 - about actually being the bad person um
80:14 - and you know being the threat actor and
80:16 - you have to try and hack into something
80:17 - and some are like both they're a mix you
80:19 - know and so I guess it's kind of similar
80:22 - to a software hackathon you know where
80:24 - there's a competition and you have to
80:25 - make an app this is sort of the infosec
80:27 - version of it where you have to apply
80:28 - your skills to either defend or attack
80:30 - something which is just really cool um
80:32 - and so I did code breaker which is put
80:35 - on by the National Security Agency the
80:38 - NSA n like the big bad NSA that
80:41 - everybody's terrified of yeah the NSA
80:43 - I'm going to guess something really
80:44 - funny for you to yeah okay so Su has
80:47 - gotten up from her chair she's running
80:49 - back to herbench to pull something off
80:51 - the
80:52 - pegboard so this is a fidget spinner
80:56 - from the
80:57 - NSA and this was what I got from them
81:00 - because I finished in like I was in the
81:02 - top 100 or whatever of their reverse
81:05 - engineering competition so that's my
81:07 - little um weird souvenir a lime green
81:11 - NSA fidget spinner have you taken it
81:13 - apart to make sure there's not like a
81:15 - microphone in
81:16 - there no but a lot of people have said
81:19 - that and I think it's really interesting
81:21 - I remember getting the um envelope in
81:24 - the mail the package in the mail and it
81:26 - just says like from National Security
81:27 - Agency and I think I put it on social
81:29 - media and I said oh well the found me it
81:31 - was nice knowing you all or something
81:33 - like that it's like every time you get a
81:35 - message from the IRS it's just like you
81:37 - you see that IRS that iconic you know
81:40 - typ face they use and you're just like
81:42 - your stomach just goes oh no you know
81:45 - then you open it and it's just like
81:48 - because I
81:50 - forgot exactly exactly so when it came I
81:53 - had a similar thought I forgot all about
81:56 - that I'd filled out my shipping address
81:57 - and everything and I was like what is oh
82:02 - and then I realized a second later so I
82:03 - definitely had that IRS moment where I
82:05 - was just like I hope this is what I
82:07 - think it is because I have gotten
82:08 - letters like that from the IRS and it's
82:10 - absolutely
82:11 - terrifying yeah awesome well I want I
82:14 - want to be respectful of your time I've
82:15 - got a lot of Rapid Fire questions I'm
82:17 - going to start asking if that's cool
82:19 - with you Su yes do it so just just to
82:21 - like kind of like uh recap your journey
82:24 - so far are so you you uh you started off
82:27 - with a computer in your house uh
82:29 - Commodore 64 The thankfully it was an
82:32 - older model and that was a that way you
82:35 - got to spend a lot more time in the
82:36 - command line and stuff like that that
82:37 - spurred your creativity you went on to
82:39 - study a great deal of different
82:42 - Technologies in as at a uh gosh what is
82:46 - the acronym T TEF T the uh Community t a
82:51 - f Ty yeah t a f and I I've written what
82:54 - that acronym stands for in here uh it
82:58 - stands for somewhere in my
83:01 - notes sorry I'm learning all about
83:03 - Australia um okay so I'm not going to
83:06 - Define that acronym I'm sorry I'll put
83:08 - it in the show notes uh but uh basically
83:11 - like community colleges so you went
83:13 - there and from there um you ultimately
83:16 - were able to work at advertising
83:17 - agencies you applied for a job in Las
83:19 - Vegas got to move and to the iconic
83:22 - Campus of uh
83:45 - zaposlite to Silicon Valley that was you
83:48 - know five or six hour drive away totes
83:51 - so you did that totes that's something
83:53 - only a Australians say like tot's
83:56 - cool am I am I correct like have you
83:59 - ever okay so if you ever hear an
84:01 - Australian cool oh is it British okay
84:04 - well um I've only heard so I didn't
84:06 - think we made it up okay yeah well um
84:09 - sorry if I'm uh attributing something to
84:11 - the Australian people that should be
84:13 - attributed to the Brits um okay
84:16 - so what I want to know is uh during your
84:20 - streaming back when you were live coding
84:22 - a lot you had this like very cool like
84:25 - first of all you got like beautiful
84:26 - taste in like mechanical keyboards and
84:28 - everything's like very elegant and uh
84:31 - like thoughtfully put together and and
84:33 - you know just like your your uh your
84:35 - background there uh with like like
84:38 - everything is very deliberately thought
84:40 - out in terms of your physical space but
84:43 - in terms of the software you use do you
84:45 - put a lot of time into customizing your
84:48 - tooling for when you're sitting down to
84:50 - write some
84:52 - code I do but then I just leave it like
84:56 - I'm not constantly tweaking it um yeah
84:59 - MP mpj from fun fun function back in the
85:02 - day I think he put it best like he stops
85:04 - himself doing it cuz he knows they'll
85:06 - just do it forever and it's just a
85:07 - distraction so um I've had the exact
85:09 - same Vim config file for years now years
85:12 - and years and years and years this
85:13 - probably hasn't changed in 5 years just
85:16 - set something up make it so that it's
85:18 - tolerable to you and then just let it go
85:21 - like you know that's sort of been my
85:23 - attitude it's not for every one but
85:24 - that's worked really really well for me
85:26 - so yeah it's just nice color scheme all
85:28 - of that it's got some of the basic tools
85:30 - that I need um and I don't try to
85:33 - customize anything to death anymore it's
85:35 - just frustrating to have to set up
85:37 - automated scripts to get it all back the
85:39 - way you want it when you have a new
85:40 - computer or if you know something
85:42 - happens and it's just a waste of
85:45 - time yeah so just good enough and then
85:50 - don't micromanage it anymore sounds like
85:52 - yeah and so you're yeah just leave it
85:54 - learn yeah if somebody wanted to learn
85:57 - them which is kind of like a a code
85:59 - editor that has a little bit steeper of
86:01 - a learning curve because you have to
86:02 - learn like all the keyboard uh shortcuts
86:05 - you got to learn like the different the
86:06 - three I think it's three different modes
86:08 - like insertion mode and you know like
86:12 - how would you recommend it like do you
86:14 - think it was worth learning
86:16 - it yes and no honestly I think it's like
86:19 - one of those huge it depends kind of
86:21 - things um if you do want to learn it you
86:23 - want to go C Turkey um I found it was
86:27 - very frustrating for 2 weeks but I
86:28 - wouldn't let myself go back to Sublime
86:30 - Text which is what I used to use just
86:33 - get through it um and I would say it's
86:36 - been really good because I do spend much
86:38 - more time on servers these days just
86:41 - like you know like into shell sessions
86:43 - and stuff like that it is so useful to
86:45 - just pop open vim and start typing but
86:47 - at the same time like Nano is there for
86:48 - people to use too and it's much easier
86:50 - to use so to be honest I wouldn't
86:52 - recommend it because it just depends on
86:54 - what you want to actually get out of
86:56 - something you know um I really enjoy it
86:58 - just because it feels minimal it uses
87:00 - not as not as much process as on my
87:02 - computer sorry not not as much you know
87:04 - resources on my computer but you know at
87:07 - the same time it's been a net positive
87:09 - for me but I wouldn't say you know it's
87:11 - been life-changing I think I'm just such
87:13 - a casual Vim User it's not like the
87:15 - primagen or um Gary burnhard or other
87:19 - people who you you see they're just like
87:21 - total Wizards in it I don't know I just
87:24 - I'm not someone who's really obsessed
87:26 - about my editor it's just if it's good
87:27 - enough it's good enough so yeah yeah
87:30 - it's a bit of a nothing Burger answer
87:32 - but I just don't think it's worth it if
87:34 - you're already happy with your tool
87:36 - whatever you know well to quote
87:38 - something that you said that I thought
87:39 - was was kind of interesting uh that
87:42 - interesting enough to be written down
87:43 - and quoted on the free cam podcast you
87:47 - said don't put your identity don't put
87:49 - your identity into a single tool and it
87:53 - sounds like m yeah it sounds like that's
87:55 - the the vibe you're good like if the
87:57 - tool works well enough you know Nano I
88:00 - use Nano all the time when I go on
88:01 - servers uh you can just type Nano and
88:04 - it's built into like I think every Linux
88:06 - distribution uh and it's just like a
88:08 - emac like environment emac curiously
88:11 - isn't default in a lot of like different
88:14 - server versions of Ubuntu and stuff so I
88:16 - can't use emac when I go in there so I
88:17 - just use Nano which is very similar uh
88:19 - shortcuts and stuff but you know
88:21 - whatever gets the job done really at the
88:23 - end of the day right
88:24 - um
88:27 - and I want to like
88:30 - reconcile the so you have spent a lot of
88:33 - time Shoring up the foundational
88:35 - knowledge of computer science of how
88:38 - networks work uh you know security
88:41 - Concepts uh how computers actually work
88:44 - and it sounds like early on in your
88:45 - career you were working with like really
88:47 - powerful tools that were like highly
88:49 - abstracted away and now as you've
88:52 - Advanced your skills you've gone like
88:54 - kind of further down the the you know
88:57 - veritable stack of mattresses that the
88:59 - princess is lying on top of to see where
89:01 - the P's are you
89:03 - know um how do you reconcile the tension
89:06 - between wanting to get things done and
89:09 - also wanting to like further cement your
89:11 - understanding of fundamentals so you can
89:13 - get things done faster in the
89:16 - future yeah I think that's actually a
89:18 - really tough thing for anybody to manage
89:21 - including myself I don't have a great
89:23 - answer for it um I think for me what I
89:28 - find really enjoyable when you go deep
89:30 - on something is when you're not having
89:31 - to be constantly distracted by having to
89:34 - look things up or feeling like you're
89:36 - hitting a brick wall because you're just
89:38 - missing some foundations on something
89:40 - it's not enjoyable to go deep if you
89:43 - know that you're missing certain
89:45 - foundations especially like right around
89:47 - that particular topic area so I think
89:49 - the motivation for me a lot of the time
89:51 - now is to zoom back even though it feels
89:53 - awful to rip yourself out of that you
89:55 - know Rabbit Hole you're in it's it's the
89:58 - excitement of knowing that okay I'm
89:59 - going to fill in these foundations I'm
90:01 - going to find something super
90:02 - interesting while filling that in anyway
90:05 - so it's still going to be an enjoyable
90:06 - process and then when I actually go deep
90:09 - it's going to be so much more productive
90:12 - you're going to have this lovely
90:13 - intuition you're going to have those
90:14 - deep flow moments you know you're going
90:16 - to be playing the synth music and just
90:18 - like churning something out I think it's
90:20 - just you've got to find a motivation to
90:24 - enjoy those deep Dives way more because
90:27 - you're not feeling imposter syndrome and
90:30 - you're not just feeling like I'm never
90:31 - going to get this you know the
90:33 - foundations have just opened up so much
90:37 - in my programming world where I I can
90:40 - just like flip-flop around and and just
90:42 - kind of dive in and out of different
90:44 - things now and I'm just not feeling like
90:48 - it's this awful kind of stumble in the
90:51 - dark um and so there are times when I
90:55 - still find it hard not to just go deep
90:57 - on something um but I think it's worth
91:00 - putting in the effort because things
91:03 - just feel way more effortless later on
91:06 - and it's really hard to give people this
91:08 - advice because it's one of those things
91:10 - where you don't get it until you
91:12 - actually do
91:13 - it um and so yeah it's it's really
91:16 - difficult for me to really give that
91:18 - advice just because you you don't know
91:20 - until you actually feel that uh and feel
91:23 - that reward of it
91:24 - sorry
91:26 - yeah when you were streaming for several
91:29 - years basically articulating your
91:31 - thoughts and like making them palatable
91:33 - you know as a teacher kind of like
91:35 - taking your thought process and Orting
91:37 - it uh uh verbalizing it do you think
91:41 - that that helped you um code
91:45 - better do you think or do you think like
91:48 - would you encourage people to like kind
91:49 - of think out loud while they're coding
91:51 - do you do you ever do that anymore is
91:53 - that like a habit like do you talk to
91:54 - yourself while you're coding or do you
91:56 - think that that slows things slows
91:58 - things down a
92:00 - lot yeah I'm I'm going to go out there
92:03 - and just say I think in general whenever
92:05 - I streamed on a Sunday as far as
92:07 - productivity problem solving challenge
92:10 - Factor it was net negative
92:13 - honestly you know I just sometimes it
92:16 - was nice to explain to other people and
92:18 - they they'd sort of give another
92:19 - perspective but a lot of the time
92:21 - because I had a lot of the domain
92:22 - knowledge of the embedded stuff like
92:24 - some people could jump in with like oh
92:26 - well what if you just like did a promise
92:28 - here instead or something like some of
92:29 - the JavaScript kind of side of things I
92:31 - would get some cool ideas from people
92:33 - but overall it was a net negative
92:35 - because I find it so hard to focus while
92:38 - I'm also talking I find it so hard to be
92:41 - kind of on the spot and have people
92:43 - watching me and so it's not helpful but
92:47 - the the thing that it did help me with
92:49 - was peir programming at work became like
92:53 - just not intimidating at all I'm like
92:54 - let's just jump into it and I was okay
92:56 - with saying I didn't know something and
92:58 - it gave me a lot more confidence with
93:00 - like working with other people because
93:02 - if you can live stream in front of a
93:03 - couple hundred people on a Sunday and
93:05 - make mistakes in front of them then you
93:07 - can pretty much just not feel afraid of
93:09 - of of working with any colleague after
93:11 - that in my opinion so it definitely
93:13 - helped with that I would say that that
93:15 - was actually kind of life-changing to be
93:17 - honest um it made my day-to-day work
93:19 - with other people much better cuz I used
93:21 - to feel very intimidated about coding in
93:23 - front of others um but the rest of it
93:25 - was honestly just a net
93:28 - negative yeah well it sounds like uh you
93:32 - did get something out of the process
93:34 - even if like those particular days like
93:37 - it was a lot of fun yeah yeah it was a
93:41 - lot of actual fun like we had heaps of
93:43 - fun I just meant programming wise and
93:45 - actually getting stuff done and things
93:47 - like that it was a bit of a a drag on
93:49 - that so there's the saying that like if
93:50 - you want to go far go together if you
93:53 - want to go fast go alone or something
93:55 - like that uh yeah I it's it's more
93:58 - interesting if you reverse it if you
93:59 - want to go fast go alone if you want to
94:01 - go far go together right and so it's
94:04 - kind of like you had the entire you know
94:07 - hundreds of people like cheering you on
94:08 - yeah s s s and like you're trying to you
94:11 - know close the pr or whatever right so
94:15 - uh yeah it sounds like the fact that you
94:17 - stuck with it for so long I mean you
94:20 - even I think I heard you built your own
94:23 - streaming platform or you started to
94:24 - build a streaming platform just because
94:26 - you were unsatis what was what's the
94:28 - story behind the sus Hinton streaming
94:32 - platform yeah I just thought that twitch
94:35 - was crap for software programming
94:38 - streams I'll just come out and say it's
94:39 - crap it's not good for that and also
94:42 - twitch incentivizes you know it's a it's
94:45 - a company that wants to profit so you
94:48 - know the profit incentives just created
94:50 - bad experiences especially for like
94:52 - programming streamers like I could talk
94:53 - to you about this for an hour so I won't
94:55 - um and so I just went out and wanted to
94:57 - create my own platform that respected
94:59 - the privacy of my users that didn't that
95:02 - allowed them to use emotes without
95:04 - having to sign up for a paid
95:05 - subscription you know so we could have
95:07 - her own inside jokes and things um that
95:10 - allowed me to just have all these
95:11 - different features that were useful for
95:14 - programming streams that twitch would
95:15 - never do right um and so there were just
95:18 - a lot of misalign incentives I felt
95:19 - using twitch as a platform uh and I I
95:22 - had enough of a community that I felt
95:24 - that they would be willing to make an
95:26 - account on my website and then actually
95:27 - watch me and and interact with me there
95:30 - and that they'd remember I was streaming
95:31 - there and things like that so I went out
95:33 - and started making that and then the
95:36 - pandemic hit right when I was getting
95:37 - close to releasing it and you know just
95:40 - obviously that just put you know a lot
95:43 - of different things in perspective and I
95:45 - put it down for a bit just because you
95:46 - know the pandemic was a tough thing to
95:48 - get through and by the time I was sort
95:50 - of coming out of that I wanted to stop
95:53 - streaming so it just never got released
95:55 - unfortunately but it was a really cool
95:56 - experience actually programming it yeah
95:59 - maybe it'll come back one day definitely
96:02 - and if if there's like an open source
96:04 - alternative that people can just self
96:05 - host a website and stream themselves on
96:08 - it I mean streaming has got to be
96:09 - expensive though in terms of like all
96:11 - the data that is involved and like like
96:15 - only a company like Amazon would have
96:17 - the coffers to be able
96:20 - to do that like economically like I I
96:23 - don't know how expensive it is to pipe
96:25 - HD video to like 200 people
96:30 - concurrently uh is that something where
96:32 - you think an individual Creator could
96:34 - actually run like a streaming platform
96:35 - like let's say it was like you know a
96:37 - self-hosted tool and you just threw up
96:39 - your server would would the bandwidth on
96:41 - that be like crazy or How would how
96:44 - would it
96:46 - work yeah that's a good question I ended
96:49 - up creating like a matrix in Microsoft
96:52 - Excel and I looked at every single
96:53 - streaming option everything from
96:56 - Amazon's own streaming technology uh to
96:59 - you know uh just like smaller companies
97:01 - that were offering at the time and all
97:02 - of the different features and whether or
97:04 - not they had closed captioning for the
97:06 - live streams whether you had video on
97:08 - demand all that kind of thing so I did
97:10 - actually do all the research and it is
97:12 - possible so I ended up standing up a
97:14 - very beefy machine I got a dedicated
97:16 - server in a data center um wasn't
97:19 - actually that expensive and then um I
97:21 - ended up H having like
97:24 - several hundred gigs of like bandwidth I
97:26 - think it was up to a terabyte of
97:28 - bandwidth or something like that um per
97:30 - month um and so and then I did a whole
97:32 - bunch of tests like I spun up kubernetes
97:35 - to create all of these like spontaneous
97:37 - you up to 500 connections to see if the
97:39 - box would stand up and if the traffic
97:42 - you know how much traffic that was
97:43 - generating and how much bandwidth and
97:45 - things like that so it's definitely
97:46 - possible because years ago I was able to
97:49 - prove that as a proof of concept in 2019
97:51 - and I think the tools have gotten a lot
97:53 - better since then anyway so yeah the
97:54 - answer is yes it's possible you just
97:56 - have to do the research and be willing
97:58 - to have your own dedicated piece of
98:01 - metal so yeah have you ever heard of
98:05 - cloud flare
98:07 - TV it's like a 247 at the time but yeah
98:11 - yeah our 247 stream focused on technical
98:13 - topics and uh it's it's kind of like
98:16 - what you're talking about it's like a
98:17 - platform but it's really just cloudfl
98:19 - like I'm I'm you can just press play and
98:21 - you can watch people like live streaming
98:23 - their 247 and I think some of it's
98:25 - probably pre-recorded it doesn't have
98:27 - chat uh but it is cool like the notion
98:30 - that like like I always fancied like
98:31 - free C Camp could have free C Camp TV
98:33 - and it would just be like an old school
98:35 - broadcast channel from you know the
98:38 - terrestrial you know uh satle like
98:42 - airwave you know like UHF if you ever
98:44 - saw the 1980s movie UHF where with weird
98:46 - inic like we could theoretically do that
98:49 - using tools that cloud fler has
98:51 - published but I still think that like
98:53 - what you're talking about is is a little
98:55 - bit different because it's like twitch
98:57 - in a box basically it sounds like
99:01 - yeah yeah I would be very interested if
99:04 - you do pursue that uh at some point or
99:07 - if you decide to get back into that
99:08 - project let me know I would be very
99:10 - interested in following that and uh I'll
99:12 - certainly try to help encourage people
99:14 - to uh contribute to it so what is on the
99:17 - horizon for Su Hinton what what are the
99:20 - big goals like we're basically out of
99:23 - the p pmic um you have an entire new
99:27 - skill set that you gain it sounds like
99:29 - you made Incredible use of that time uh
99:32 - what are your plans for the next few
99:35 - years yeah you kind of caught me at a
99:37 - Crossroads so I I I quit that job the
99:41 - research job um couple of months ago it
99:43 - was an amazing job um I
99:47 - just want to take a little bit of time
99:49 - off for myself that's all that was a
99:51 - very hard decision actually because I
99:52 - loved my team I just need some time off
99:55 - I I am carrying a little bit of burnout
99:57 - and I'm just finishing up my Master's
99:59 - Degree as well I'm working on my thesis
100:01 - at the moment so it seemed like good
100:03 - timing for me to just focus just on the
100:06 - thesis just spend a little bit of time
100:09 - like recouping um you know just being
100:12 - well enough again and things like that
100:15 - um so yeah like I'm keeping things open
100:17 - ended this year um I will be finished
100:19 - and hopefully graduating by July so
100:22 - that's actually not that far away it's
100:23 - May right now so I think 6 to 8 weeks
100:26 - I'll be finished with the master uh
100:28 - thesis and to be honest I'm trying to
100:31 - keep things open um and so I'll be doing
100:33 - a little bit of contract work for the
100:34 - rest of the year in software um and I'm
100:38 - looking to maybe start working on some
100:40 - online education courses because I'd
100:42 - love to get back into teaching so yeah
100:45 - just not putting a lot of pressure on
100:46 - myself but just getting around to
100:48 - personal software projects I've been
100:50 - putting off for years cuz I've been in
100:52 - school you know since the p mic started
100:54 - and and things like that so just you
100:56 - know sort of being able to slow down a
100:59 - bit and just come back to some of the
101:00 - things that are just really important to
101:02 - me um so that I can also just help shed
101:05 - a lot of the burnout of just working in
101:07 - the industry as well cuz this is my 20th
101:09 - year in the industry um you know it
101:12 - would be sadly it would be a bit strange
101:15 - if I didn't have a little bit of burnout
101:17 - at this point
101:18 - right yeah can you talk about like and I
101:21 - don't want to put you on the spot uh but
101:24 - can you talk about like how you sensed
101:26 - burnout was setting in like what was
101:29 - there some like moment that you just
101:31 - like damn I think I'm burning out or was
101:33 - it just like a gradual creeping process
101:36 - like be because I mean it seems like you
101:38 - have arrived at that conclusion I'm
101:40 - burning out I need to change I need to
101:41 - take some time off I'm curious for
101:44 - people that are listening to this who
101:45 - may also be closing in on a decade or
101:48 - two decades doing software development
101:50 - like how they can recognize this and
101:52 - know that they need to take time off
101:54 - before things get even
101:57 - worse yeah for sure it's a it's a really
102:00 - important question a lot of it is
102:01 - creeping up um but for me it was like a
102:05 - spike in anxiety every day when you just
102:08 - have to do normal things so if someone
102:10 - hits you up on slack and it's just
102:12 - totally normal it's they're not asking
102:14 - you for anything urgent they just want
102:15 - to talk to you and you just start
102:16 - feeling overwhelmed every time um or
102:19 - just it spikes your anxiety and you just
102:21 - you start withdrawing from people don't
102:23 - want to talk to them at work even though
102:25 - they're your teammates you just yeah you
102:27 - find yourself isolating yourself and
102:29 - then on top of that your productivity
102:30 - just takes a huge dive so you know that
102:33 - there'll be days where there'll be
102:34 - nothing wrong going in your life but
102:37 - getting out of bed is really hard and
102:38 - then you sit at the computer and you
102:40 - just don't do any work and you're just
102:43 - sort of your brain is screaming at you
102:45 - you're like we have to do something
102:46 - today and it just doesn't happen you
102:49 - know and then the next day there's a lot
102:50 - of pressure you feel guilty so you're
102:52 - able to kind of push through and and do
102:54 - it but it just feels everything just
102:56 - feels like you're walking through you
102:59 - know trying to get out of quicksand even
103:01 - though you're getting your job done it
103:03 - just feels so wrong and you're having to
103:06 - just absolutely force yourself and
103:08 - you're avoiding talking to anybody and
103:11 - everything just feels like a huge
103:13 - overload on you when it's just normal
103:16 - day-to-day duties I think that was the
103:18 - first signs for me just total
103:20 - disengagement but you know obviously
103:23 - still trying your best to do your job
103:25 - because you need to make money to
103:27 - survive right um and it just feeling
103:30 - wrong even though you couldn't find any
103:32 - other reason in your life why you're
103:33 - struggling to show up every day if that
103:35 - makes sense yeah thank you for sharing
103:38 - that and uh what are some things you're
103:40 - doing now that you have some time to
103:42 - yourself like how are you kind of
103:44 - decompressing and like rejuvenating
103:47 - yourself uh and uh like I guess tending
103:50 - to that that wound of just burn out I
103:53 - guess that psychic
103:56 - wound mhm yeah I think I've just been a
103:59 - would trying to find Joy um so that when
104:03 - I start feeling better like I'm still
104:06 - engaged with the things I enjoy I
104:08 - haven't taken a total break from
104:09 - everything if that makes sense so I'm
104:11 - reading a lot reading way more um and
104:14 - I'm reading about things like Computer
104:16 - History um
104:19 - and just other things you know like um
104:23 - watching a lot of video game
104:24 - documentaries on how video games are put
104:26 - together like just and and watching a
104:28 - lot of creators on YouTube do what they
104:30 - love so just watching other people who
104:32 - aren't burned out or who I don't think
104:34 - are burnt out really engaging with the
104:36 - things they enjoy so that I can get that
104:39 - reminder of why I you know why I love
104:42 - being a software engineer or why I love
104:44 - doing embedded stuff or or why you know
104:47 - I have these hobbies that I have that I
104:49 - just don't feel like I can engage with
104:51 - at the moment so just trying to stay
104:53 - connected um but also trying to do low
104:57 - energy things like that right like
104:58 - reading a book or watching a documentary
105:00 - is is quite low energy it's forgiving
105:03 - yourself for not being productive but
105:05 - it's just keeping you connected all the
105:07 - same to the communities that you feel
105:09 - inspired by I think that's been the
105:11 - biggest thing I've been able to do so
105:14 - that I'm not just sitting around feeling
105:16 - sorry for myself if that makes sense or
105:18 - feeling guilty for it you know
105:21 - yeah yeah I mean that sounds great like
105:25 - I'll you know share that like I watch
105:28 - lots of documentaries on YouTube uh I I
105:31 - read a lot uh I go for long walks with
105:33 - podcasts and I attribute I guess my
105:36 - longevity which isn't as long as yours
105:37 - 20 like I I've been doing free cocing
105:39 - for like 10 years almost uh so I'm very
105:43 - much trying to Pace myself because I've
105:44 - had so many friends who've just hit a
105:46 - brick wall with burnout and uh but I'm
105:49 - it sounds like you're doing everything
105:50 - you need to do to recover so we're
105:53 - pulling for you to be like back to full
105:55 - power eventually whenever that is uh but
105:59 - um yeah thank I really appreciate you
106:01 - sharing that because in Tech we have
106:03 - this like kind of Mythos around like
106:06 - productivity and it's it's an American
106:08 - thing right America's obsessed with
106:10 - productivity uh and you know uh I don't
106:13 - know if that was like a cultural shock
106:14 - when you went to the US where
106:15 - everybody's like so focused on work and
106:17 - career defines who they are so much yeah
106:23 - I mean was there a moment huge uh it was
106:24 - really hot actually was there a moment
106:27 - where you were like a dinner party and
106:28 - like people asked you what you did and
106:30 - like like where you realize wow this is
106:32 - different from like where I'm from like
106:34 - people don't you know immediately the
106:37 - difference was was immediate um and just
106:41 - yeah just seeing seeing people really
106:43 - struggle to even like leave a job
106:46 - because they felt like their identity
106:48 - was in it or like people who try to
106:49 - build empires in jobs because that's
106:52 - like their identity it's just people's
106:53 - identity being so deeply embedded in not
106:57 - just like what they do for a living but
107:00 - also that specific company and the team
107:02 - or like the the project that they're on
107:04 - like people putting their identity into
107:06 - the specific project and them feeling
107:09 - bad if they're working on something
107:11 - that's not as exciting as their their as
107:13 - their other colleague is is you know
107:15 - working on something way cooler that
107:17 - really really shocked me I feel very
107:21 - very um grateful that that's not
107:24 - something that I've ever really had a
107:25 - problem with like I can see that and see
107:28 - it's unhealthy and I'm not interested
107:30 - and um it's just been it's just been a a
107:34 - huge contrast and and I don't think
107:38 - that I just don't think that I could
107:41 - ever really do that and again that's
107:43 - probably privileged to a degree but I
107:45 - just I turn off I want to do the best
107:48 - job I can within reason and then I want
107:50 - to be a really great teammate to work
107:52 - with but I just don't want to put any
107:54 - identity in it beyond that if that makes
107:56 - sense yeah but it it really threw me
107:58 - when I first moved there and some people
108:00 - did actually judge me for that they
108:01 - thought that I wasn't being a team
108:02 - player and things like that and but I
108:05 - would say that what I was doing was
108:06 - completely reasonable I wasn't slacking
108:09 - off or anything like that uh I was just
108:11 - being realistic yeah you weren't letting
108:14 - my opinion so you weren't letting work
108:15 - completely take over your life like a
108:17 - lot of people allow that to happen
108:19 - exactly like like your employer will let
108:21 - will take as much of your time energy as
108:23 - they can they'll put you on that fancy
108:25 - you know Google bus and and have you
108:28 - writing code while you commute instead
108:29 - of you know uh like like as much of your
108:33 - time and energy they'll serve dinner
108:35 - really late at night so you'll stay for
108:36 - the free meal so you'll work a little
108:38 - later right like all those little tricks
108:40 - that they do to get you uh or or they
108:42 - call the company a family instead of
108:44 - just being you know a team right um a
108:47 - lot of those things that are like I
108:49 - don't know if they do it I mean I think
108:50 - they do that in places like China and
108:52 - Japan and stuff like other countries
108:53 - that have unhealthy work cultures but uh
108:57 - but I'm hardened to hear that it it
108:59 - isn't like that in Australia right like
109:02 - not not to the extent it is in the
109:05 - US not to the extent it can be I think
109:09 - that I think that we all fall into the
109:11 - Trap I think that no country is really
109:12 - like completely immune it's just not to
109:15 - the same degree for sure so I definitely
109:18 - feel that I fit more into the C the
109:20 - working culture here um people are
109:22 - working a lot right now just because
109:24 - cost of living and and working is very
109:26 - stressful but it's just not the same
109:29 - identity entrenchment here um and yeah
109:33 - people do want to go home to their
109:34 - families and stuff like that so yeah
109:37 - well I don't us like I want to end on a
109:39 - positive note and not just on on like U
109:41 - you know American work culture and my
109:43 - beef with it and and you know burnout
109:45 - and things like that since you've been
109:46 - reading a lot of books we don't usually
109:48 - do recommendations since you've been
109:49 - reading a lot of books and you watch a
109:50 - lot of video game documentaries
109:53 - what are some recommends that you have
109:56 - for people who've listened this far into
109:57 - the podcast are there any channels that
109:59 - you just like love watching to fire you
110:03 - up yeah so um one of the main channels
110:06 - that I love so much is nerd Forge nerd
110:09 - Forge um I'll yeah I'll list all of
110:12 - these they just do really creative stuff
110:14 - I'm so into them I'm trying to figure
110:16 - out what the documentary one I watch I
110:18 - think it's called cut clip cut clip but
110:20 - I'm trying to remember the name of the
110:22 - channel
110:23 - I'm just scrolling through YouTube right
110:25 - now trying to find it for you while
110:27 - you're while you're scrolling for it I'm
110:28 - going to throw in one of my
110:29 - recommendations this channel is so great
110:32 - they do like Retro Gaming documentaries
110:34 - and they do like the best kind of like
110:36 - nostalgic 3D graphics and stuff it's
110:37 - called uh it's called
110:40 - splashwave and so they'll cover like how
110:42 - Sonic Sonic the Hedgehog was made you
110:45 - know talk about Michael Jackson's
110:46 - involvement in the development of the
110:48 - music and that he was like a huge fan of
110:50 - Sonic the Hedgehog and he actually
110:51 - approached him because he wanted to make
110:53 - that's cool uh or um they'll talk about
110:55 - uh you know the history of like
110:57 - different like Sega games different
110:59 - arcade games they'll talk about like the
111:00 - architecture that made certain arcade
111:02 - games possible and they they model all
111:04 - this stuff so a lot of the shots are
111:06 - like effect shots and stuff it's so cool
111:08 - and it's got like that that kind of like
111:11 - you know synth retrowave type uh sound
111:14 - going on so um yeah what are some other
111:17 - channels you
111:19 - recommend yeah so the the channel is no
111:22 - clip no clip um that's the Video Game
111:24 - documentary Channel yeah they are
111:26 - fantastic um and as far as books go
111:29 - right now I am absolutely loving the
111:31 - dream
111:32 - machine it's just it's such a good book
111:36 - um it's very dense and very long but I
111:38 - just it is it is the best narrative
111:41 - about just how Computing came to be um
111:45 - it's just an absolutely delightful read
111:46 - I've been really inspired by that so
111:48 - that's the main one that I'm reading at
111:50 - the moment but before that I read um
111:54 - space Rogue I think space
111:56 - Rogue that one is about you know the um
111:59 - original Cult of the dead cow um hacking
112:02 - group they're really really cool and so
112:05 - space Rogue was one of the um pseudonyms
112:08 - of the one of the members of the group I
112:11 - believe very cool yeah I remember
112:13 - believe I'm blanking on all of this
112:14 - stuff I remember the cult of the dead
112:16 - cow back in like the the BBS days and
112:18 - stuff we would they are so cool yeah
112:20 - yeah very cool dream machine space Rogue
112:23 - nerd Forge no clip I will second that I
112:25 - love the no clip Hades development uh
112:29 - series it's like four hours worth of
112:31 - like how they made the game Hades I
112:33 - think it is called Hades right like it's
112:35 - like a kind of isometric perspective
112:38 - where you're like zipping around and
112:39 - fighting like all these Greek gods and
112:41 - stuff it's cool um so Su I just want to
112:45 - thank you again for like 20 years in the
112:48 - field and you're still sharing your
112:49 - wisdom and uh I'm very excited to talk
112:52 - with you
112:53 - offline about like you know software
112:56 - development education that's something
112:58 - very passionate about and uh we will
113:00 - take as much Suz Hinton as we can on the
113:03 - free C Camp YouTube channel like
113:04 - publishing your tutorials anything we
113:06 - can do to help get that wisdom out there
113:08 - uh to as many people as we can freely um
113:11 - so I want to thank you again for making
113:13 - time to come on the Freo Camp
113:17 - podcast yeah thanks for having me this
113:19 - has been a really fun conversation yeah
113:21 - and everybody listening until next week
113:23 - happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

this is my 20th year in the industry um you know it would be sadly it would be a bit strange if I didn't have a little bit a burnout at this point right welcome back to the Freo Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of freecodecamp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by Suz Hinton she's a software engineer security researcher and she was one of the pioneers of live coding on Twitch Su how's everything going with you well it's going great thanks um I'm really excited to be on this podcast given that we've known each other for a while so yeah and this is like the first time we've actually had like a synchronous conversation I think we may have been on some podcasts together like guests on like JS party or some of these other podcast but I don't think that I've ever actually talked to you in real time back and forth like this no it's it's always been like email or again yeah it was with the gaggle of other people so yeah yeah well was so cool uh I am hyped to learn about you uh I'm going to be taking notes furiously as we go through this and uh I've already done a lot of research like rereading your awesome article that's on free C Camp about your live stream live coding setup and uh I'm going to be linking that and other cool things that Su mentions in the show notes but yeah let's let's get into it uh I always like to start with just giving people perspective and understanding your kind of origin story as a developer because you have like a really interesting twisting and turning whining path through Tech because you were in Tech very early and then you just went and basically did like every single sub area of tech over the years it seems like yeah we and and the other thing to note is I know I've been talking most of this podcast so if you heard some of what Sue said she does have a little bit of a nonnorth American accent she hails from Down Under yeah so you're based in Melbourne yeah that's right Melbourne Australia which is southeast kind of like on the way to Antarctica so so you can kind of stop over that's usually how I try and describe it yeah apparently yeah yeah and I had the pleasure of visiting Melbourne uh a few years ago for a conference and it was just I love that City my goodness I'm not sure if I'll ever go again just because it was a huge plane trip to get over there from California I mean like it was like a the longest flight I've ever taken was to Melbourne I think yeah but uh yeah like what was it like growing up in Australia and like what were your early Ambitions as a kid I loved going up here I think I was definitely somebody who felt very lucky very very lucky and we we used to sort of affectionately refer to our country as The Lucky Country just because we knew if you were born here that you already had a really good Head Start in life um wasn't a very ambitious person you know like I you know even just growing up I didn't have huge travel aspirations or anything so it is funny in the end that I ended up living in um in the United States for about 12 years um but yeah I just loved growing up here this city has gotten the world's most livable city award like years and years and years in a row um it's just it is actually an objectively good City even though I'm very biased because I was born and raised here but yeah um there's a reason why I'm living back here again right and I haven't chosen elsewhere so yeah well what did you like what were your early interests because I know like whenever I talk like you're like the third Australian I've interviewed for like the re recent recent history on the podcast and uh it sounds like like a lot of the technology that that we had in the states uh like a lot of like early Apple Computers uh Commodore 64 Amiga uh a lot of those computer like did you grow up did were you lucky enough to like have a computer in your home what type of gear were you working with yeah that's a great question so um I know that a lot of that stuff originated in America but it does kind of find its way to the I guess like secondary and tertiary markets so um my family growing up didn't have like a ton of money uh we I was very fortunate to to grow up middle class but it's not like we could afford to buy like the brand new computers um all the time and it was sort of hard to justify buying one back then um because it was you know the late 80s early 90s it was really only a few are very geeky about computers um this was pre Windows and all of that so I was lucky enough to inherit a Commodore 64 from my uncle and mind you this was still this was the early '90s so we were starting to move into Windows 3.1 um but I didn't care that it was behind I didn't even know that it was a computer that was behind um but given that there's no sort of goey there's all you do is type into a prompt you know I I turned to my dad and said how do you you use this it looks cool but I don't know how to use it and so he showed me a few prompts uh he taught me a tiny bit of basic and then he just kind of left the the the computer manuals with me um and I just got really hooked straight away so I think that I was was lucky in that I did inherit an older computer because I had to sort of learn computers like the hard way um and so even when we moved into things like Windows 3.1 95 98 things like that I was still trying to code you know um regardless because I found that that was quite interesting yeah and was there anything that pushed you in like a creative Direction like were were there some applications that you were using that like really uh it what point did you start saying I want to learn more computers learn more computers more about computers and I want this to be like a thing that I do when I grow up did was that like in your mind at all yeah the last part was not in my mind at all I just thought it was a fun hobby like again I'm not very ambitious and so I just I was just like I like this computer so I'm going to keep playing with it but I think what really brought things home for me was once you once batch files were a thing in Windows and you can start automating things um that's when I got really excited because you know you can set things up so as soon as you log in to your account you can run a batch file and that batch file will you know pop up all the different programs that on games or like Windows Media Player or something and I just thought that was so cool that you could you know just script something like that um and then once I actually started getting onto the internet um I would catch the bus to my local library because we didn't have the internet at home um I just thought websites were so cool and I figured out that you can actually make them you know I found a book in the library for kids called your own website um I actually ended up finding a copy um years later for nostalgic reasons but I looked at it and I was like oh you just type stuff in notepad this is actually like way easier than I thought it would be and so I think my big moment was really learning how to use computers to do things for you so it was like the batch files but it was also making websites was just such a creative thing as a kid and then putting it on the internet being able to tell your friends they can go look at it at home as well you know there's something very magical about that experience especially back then when not a lot of your friends actually had websites or or you know were interested in that yeah yeah I mean you got to be like the first kid on the Block so to speak or one of the first kids in your class to to have their own web presence if you will yeah it was exciting it was like the late '90s and I just thought it was the coolest thing ever yeah yeah so like uh at what point did you start thinking about like School Beyond High School yeah I originally wanted to be a veter nurse um but I kind of just lost interest like I I really like animals but then I realized that it was going to be maybe a bit of a depressing job I think that unless you go on to become a full uh veterinarian you kind of don't have the nice jobs as vet nurse um so I sort of went back to the drawing board and I didn't really think of computers for the longest time until probably the last year of high school and I had never heard of computer science um I didn't hear of it until years and years later and so I'm just you know looking in the you had this big reference book back then uh in Australia of all of the different university courses you could take and so it was a physical book that you you you sort of like palmed through and I just kind of started looking up information technology and applying to random um universities that way but none of those courses were anything that I actually wanted to do so to be honest I was pretty lost and I didn't know if I could even get a job you know it was still just a hobby for me at that stage so I sort of locked out in the end I think yeah what did you end up doing like in terms of studies yeah so I got into like an information technology degree but it was going to be like a I think a 2 to 3 hour um public transport ride there and back so you know like 4 to 6 hours round trip every day I just figured out that that just wasn't feasible I wasn't ready to move out yet so um my mom actually saw like an advertisement in the local newspaper for a um I guess the equivalent in America is community college but here it's called ta which is tertiary and further education so it's more of a trade school um she found like an advertisement for like um multimedia it was a multimedia course it's now been renamed to interactive media and it just looked like everything I've ever wanted to do in one right it was like sound production and 3D modeling and um video and making interactive games and making websites and things like that so um just got just just kind of just a spur of the moment thing we went down to the school and applied and it was past the deadline and everything but they actually let me in based on the websites I'd been making as a kid you know um so honestly it was just very serendipitous because that course that sort of twoe um associate of Arts sort of put me on a good pathway for me realizing that this might be a thing that I can do professionally yeah and what kind of uh skills did you walk out of that program with and like I don't want to gloss over the entire program because we've got so much to talk about but like while you're answering that question just like any other like interesting kind of discoveries you had about yourself or about technology during those two years uh getting your Associates yeah I think what I found was that as long as it was creative like it was as long as it was a you know using the computer in a creative sense I would just really latch on and get very engaged um with learning but the course was not really learning any programming there was a little bit of scripting and Flash but it was mostly just doing everything else but programming um which sort of gives you this huge grab bag of skills that I've been able to reach into over and over again over my career and also in my personal life as well you know especially the the sound production the video creation you know because we'll talk about that later but even just the 3D modeling you know that came in way more useful in my life than I thought it ever would um and so it was just good to learn a bunch of different things that I didn't even know was sort of you know a a path of expertise just to get a sample of everything so I sort of came out of that course as a very sort of wellrounded creative technologist I guess you could say yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense um and it sounds almost kind of like the equivalent of like going to like video game design school or something like that is yeah yeah there was actually a video game track that they opened up later on and I was really annoyed because they they released that like a year into my course and I was like oh do I switch to that one that seems so cool yeah well I mean you've described your uh your education as a quote unquote jack of all trades um and uh you know could you talk about why this process was like a big asset just having like such a grab bag of skills uh and like what your first jobs like what they were after you finished this program mhm yeah I think it definitely set me up for um my first couple of jobs I was just sort of taking contract work for a little bit and when you take contract work you know sometimes they will just ask if you um you know if you can do this or do that and they sort of try and sort of use as many skills as they can um and so it meant that I could just jump from contract to contract and not worry about the fact that I was like very Junior um because I could just sort of like use that jack of all trades to problem solve in in a lot of different cases and so for example you know one of my first jobs I was making Flash banners for like a major car company and just making cars Zoom around you know on and I was that person that made the annoying ad banners that you saw on the early internet which you know whenever you AR I'm quite ashamed cleaning of the industry yeah I was just thinking like so for people that don't know uh what sus is talking about like I just had these memories like certainly the early 2000s you you would arrive my kids are like yelling something in incomprehensible about Sour Patch Kids mom's coming to uh escort them away from the premise all right uh so what I was saying is um yeah like I remember you'd like arrive at like IGN or like some video game website and like you'd be like all right I can't wait to read this article like all this stuff starts popping out like all this animation and and of course your site like your internet connection starts chunking and everything is like super duper slow because this overly ambitious you know thing is like blocking your view of the article you're trying to read exactly so you were like developing that those kinds of things for like advertising agencies or who who were you working with yeah so that was me that was me making those annoying ads and they were particularly animation heavy back then just to get the people's attention uh it was the advertising agency Jay Walter Thompson that's who I worked for early in my career um and so yeah they one day they'd say uh we need you to do these flash banners and then another day that' say oh we have this um InDesign document that we're making into a PDF but we want you to add sort of some interactive hotspots in it do you know how to do that and then another time you know they'd be asking me to make this fullon sort of immersive video website that where the video sort of Blends in with the web page and it was it was very sort of futuristic back then um and so being being able to be on the video set as we were sort of filming and me having that background really helped me say yes this is something that I'll be able to blend in and just having all of these different pieces of um even though it was all very surface level obviously like Jack of all trades there was just these really nice instinctive moments where I could come in and and intuitively you know understand how something would be put together and in the advertising agency world that is just so bizarre are just really wild stuff happening all the time um thinking on your feate was very high highly valued at the time I guess yeah so a lot of people who are entering software development like the way I describe the free cocan podcast audience is like onethird developers onethird High School University students and onethird people who are working in other fields that want to get into software development maybe they're driving trucks maybe they are working as an accountant maybe they are uh just coming out of rehab or coming out of incarceration or any number of different things right maybe they're just getting out of like uh you know some sort of situation where they were previously like a stayathome spouse and now they have to reenter the workforce right so like like there's a wide variety of people and a lot of those people may have like skills from a past life like they used to work in uh one field or another like as a developer just daytoday do you find yourself calling on all these kind of random skills that at the time may may have felt like I'm not sure if I'm ever actually going to use this in a professional capacity like have you have you found just like random things that you picked up to continue to be useful and helpful for getting things done yeah yes and no I think it greatly depends on what your profession is you know like I think that there'll be little random things that come in handy and obviously I can't comment on that because I haven't done a lot of those different careers but um um just things from time to time so for example you know I've never worked at a video game agency um and I've never you know had to do anything professional in that capacity but because we played with some of those physics a little bit in tap um I've being able to just you know intuitively understand when a certain animation needs to happen on a website when you're using CSS animations and like the the tweening or the key um you know creating the of just like drawing a blank what are they called the key key key frames no not yeah key frames is that like like when you're like animating something like you you kind of like yeah put the character in different shapes and then the software interpolates like what the animation is supposed to happen Okay M yeah I don't know anything about animation I just got lucky and knew that for that term yeah exactly and so that stuff came along for web pages like years and years and years later right like flash was already dead I thought okay I'm never going to use any of those skills over again um and then all of a sudden you know we had things like key frames and CSS and I'm like oh my God you know I can actually use that now or even when 3js came to um the web right um in JavaScript you know I was at a hackathon once and um somebody wanted to create this sort of like 3D lathing system and you know I already had some of the kind of theory on that even just like calculating the frost room and things like that and you know for actually programmatically creating it even though I'd never touched programmatic 3D modeling I had that you know intuitive background where I could figure things out and I sort of had that that that you know reasoning in order to problem solve so it hasn't come in handy all the time but it sort of surprises me when it does because it does tend to be quite spontaneous like that yeah yeah that's cool it sounds like this uh broad skill said has been very helpful so from developing uh you know banner ads and and other things that advertising agencies needed like like where did you move from there in terms of like the what was the next step step in your career yeah advertising was definitely not for me like if you've seen Mad Men um it's very much I love Mad Men I love I love that show we talk about it often it's like my favorite show of all time but I would never want to live in that world that's that's funny yeah exactly exactly it is funny that it's one of your favorite shows but yeah it it was very much like that right like every every agency is its own flavor of that depending on the decade and like you know there's just different different nuances to it it just wasn't for me I think I was there for maybe a year a year and a half or something I forget but I just wanted something a bit more quiet um and something that wasn't advertising it just didn't sit with me you know I just was like I don't like making these annoying things that people have to run into on the internet right it just didn't feel right so um I ended up just pivoting into different roles so I moved into elearning next um I was actually teaching parttime um the back at the the tap the university that I studied at I went back to teach for 3 years to parttime so I just moved right into education actually so I was sort of I was doing QA and accessibility testing for a bunch of elearning tools that are used in various ta institutions in Australia and then yeah I would then go in Moonlight as a teacher and so that was nice and then I just worked for a bunch of web shops right like consultancies and stuff before you know working for more SAS um companies later in the last in the sorry in the the second part of my career so far so it was just kind of stumbling around trying to find stuff that you know was was a bit more morally in line with what I wanted to work on yeah so you had problems with like working in the advertising agent agency industry if you will I mean that whole industry is based around like manufacturing desire of products that people don't necessarily need right getting them to spend money getting people going to De lots of products that are very bad for obviously Mad Men the whole the whole theme going through the entire Series this isn't a big spoiler because it comes up in the very first episode is cigarettes right like cigarettes are an unnecessary thing that are incredibly damaging to people like they're damaging to the environment they're damaging obviously to Public Health like uh a huge portion of my tax dollars that I pay are going to help people who smoked a bunch of cigarettes and are now need all this end of life care that's caused by that and you know like man like Don Draper the main character himself is like addicted to smoking and he can't quit and he just kind of like accepts that's that's one of the things I love about madman sorry to go off on a Madman tangent but like it was no I get it inconceivable that you could actually quit and he's just like really pissed off at the cigarette companies whom he's been benefiting from his entire career as an Advertiser advertising executive right um he's just upset like because he realizes like I'm hooked this is going to kill me and I can't quit like I I'm just going to be addicted to this for the rest of my life he feels like he's been hoodwinked essentially and it's like kind of like the it's like this angry chip on his shoulder throughout the series but um but yeah like I I can totally see like I have lots of friends who are in advertising and not everybody's advertising something as damaging as cigarettes but I can I can I can still see like maybe you could talk about that like don't worry about sliding the advertising industry just talk about like how you really feel about the field having worked in it like were there any moments where you really felt you look back and you regret doing certain things that you did yeah it's good because I I it's a good question because I did go in very naive right and the that was sort of the job to get back in the day if you um were kind of more on the creative side of software as well um and so it was so exciting you know I was competing with other graduates in my class for that job like we all wanted that job so badly and so to be honest you know I think there are a lot of parallels with that nowadays in certain jobs that seem really cool but might be a bit morally questionable um but that was my first experience with it really opened my eyes I don't know it was just working in advertising was really cool for a lot of different reasons it was very like fastpaced you know there were times when we were pulling all nighters to um Pitch to to win a certain account you know like there was this big Lottery account that we were trying to win and we made their entire pit into a huge game show in one of the meeting rooms so we converted one of the rooms into a massive game show and everyone had to dress up and you know and so I was being picked up at 4 in the morning to come and work on the interactive PDF because you know that's when the designers actually finally finished the work went to bed right and then I got the phone call in the middle of the night and that's like really really bad right that's a very bad thing and we don't encourage that but that was sort of the adrenaline rush of working in advertising where sometimes you get a bit Stockholm syndrom in where you you're all in it together you know and so it's exciting and we might win the pitch and things like that and you sort of feel like you're part of something um and so I would say that it was just very mixed I wasn't always creating annoying crappy things were websites for um Brands as well where you know the the the the actual user had to want to go to the website they had to want to go to kelloggs.com or something and you know visit that website and so we weren't sort of annoying them in that way and so I would just say it was mixed but after I left I definitely regretted that I added to the advertising on the internet because I think that back then it was pretty simple there wasn't there was no such thing as tracking pixels and things like that at least when I first started but by the time I moved to the industry and I saw how much more creepy and manipulative advertising was getting that's when I started feeling embarrassed that I was sort of part of the beginnings of it if that makes sense yeah that totally makes sense because like adte advertising technology like being able like there have been a lot of breakthroughs and trying to successfully get you to part with your money really or or to make some sort of big purchasing decision on behalf of your company or whatever it is uh and the thing that uh it works right like if you go raise a bunch of venture capital and you have this war chest uh you can go out and you can pretty much guaranteed get customers through running Google ads or Facebook ads right and uh because there's just this big audience and you can go through and you can microt Target and you can ab test and you can just kind of use these different processes to arrive at an ad that will convert um were you involved in any of that stuff or did that that come later after you got out of the industry yeah thankfully I wasn't involved with that um and back then because internet speeds were so slow especially in Australia you know we were required to keep those flash banners really small like I submitted I uploaded one to you know the marketing platform once and I got a this was back in the day you had a phone on your desk too yeah like I would get a call from the guy at the marketing agency totally separate from the advertising agency and he'd be like yeah so your flash Banner was 16 kiloby but we needed to be 15 and so you know we we did have razor thin file size margins back then and that's quite hard to do when you have like a car asset and the jpeg background for it and a bunch of text and a bunch of key frames and things like that you had to get really creative you know yes yeah you had to get really creative asiz yeah sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you by the way like there's like a big time difference between Texas and Melbourne uh so if it seems like I'm interrupting Sue or if Su is taking a little longer to react like it's hard to get much farther around the earth than you and I are right now when we're talking to one another so I just for the sake of the audence I'm wide into the AET yeah yeah me too I've got like 500 megabits like super duper fast internet you've got super duper fast internet the physical distance the packets need to travel is just so long so sorry anyway uh saying not that fast anyway um yes yeah so you know you really had to creatively optimize that kind of stuff and I felt that that was at least considerate right where you didn't want to encroach on the user you didn't want them to have to pay extra for like downloading extra stuffff junk and so back then um as well this was when I was doing this right when Facebook had just launched publicly right and I would say that Facebook has been responsible for a lot of the really creepy and really manipulative advertising right you know and I think that was sort of the dawn of the more sophisticated advertising the same with Google when Gmail came out and they started advertising on you know the AdSense the keywords and things it was right at the dawn of that so thankfully I didn't get to be part of that you know I'd left and it's not as if I saw that and thought I'm getting out I don't like it obviously it took me took us all a few years to really understand what was going on and and for those those really creepy tactics to come out um but yeah I was lucky enough that I sort of don't really attach myself to that but I just yeah still feel a bit dodgy while the same yeah so where do you go from there like like you've got these skills uh but you're kind of disenchanted with the industry that you're in so so you said you went back to school uh which is really cool by the way like going to teach I heard that you kind of even helped rewrite some of the curriculum that you yourself learned when you were at uh I'm going to get the the acronym wrong uh the Community College equivalent in t yes uh yeah like did teaching did that like fire you up did you enjoy teaching yeah I did actually I really enjoyed it um I'm not sure why I just really liked you I mean you you're the perfect person to talk to about this um you know you know when you get that you see that light bulb go off on in someone and you know you see them actually like really enjoy what they're learning and they feel like oh I can actually do this too and it's the same as like any hobby like I think any hobby that you do most people are very very happy to teach somebody else because just bringing them in and and sharing that Joy with someone is really really great so that was something that I think was what motivated me um to teach I wanted to spread the same joy that I felt when I sat down at the Commodore 64 for the first time um and I rewrote the curriculum mostly just because uh when we did our web design 3 semester uh it was using a Microsoft access database and cold fusion and that was sort of starting to become uh just old Legacy kind of software and so I thought this isn't Preparing People for the workplace very well so I rewrote it in PHP and basically the um we did the wamp stack in the end so the windows uh Apache uh MySQL and um PHP stuck so I just rewrote the whole curriculum to do that and instead of creating um I forget what we actually made in that c fusion class but I said okay everyone's going to make a Blog and then you can use that also as your portfolio if you want when you graduate um because back then you had to actually show portfolios to get web jobs you weren't doing like leak code or hacker ranker or anything like that right um and so I just rewrote it to make it more useful for them when they graduated and I just thought that cold fusion and access was just not going to be the way going forward so that was the main reason why I rote it I just thought it would be more engaging that way yeah well I I do want to get to live coding uh before we get to live coding though um I mean again I'm trying to like piece together the chronology of your career in real time but uh but like teaching and live coding have got to be pretty related like those skills that you got helping light bu go off in people's heads like face to face and now you're jumping on Twitch and you're basically just coding live right there and like them and like showing people everything you're doing and explaining what you're doing and talking out loud thinking out loud and interacting with chat and stuff maybe you can talk about the process of getting into live coding what inspired you to first start doing it yeah for sure I mean I got inspired by the people that were doing it really early on so um Casey from hand handmade hero um he I think was one of the very very first to do it um but I think what gave me the boot up the bum so to speak to to actually try it myself was I had a friend who was doing um he was doing open source and he just I think he just did YouTube live or something like that I forget what he did but he just um I just don't want to put him on blast so I'm just giving him some privacy by not calling out who they are but um he just did some open source he's like hi you know I work on I'm helping to maintain pouch DB I'm just like you know I just need to do some open source work I just want you to show I just want to show people like what is it like to actually maintain open source cuz I think there's a lot of sort of misconceptions at the time know I think this was back in 2015 2014 there were just a lot of misconceptions about open source and contributing to it and you know a lot of people sort of put open source maintainers on a big platform and found them intimidating so he's just like oh just you know just sit and watch what I do for an hour and watch me flipping through issues and closing them out or replying to them and he was also just showing that there's a lot of drudgery in it it's not just like heroic coding and pushing up pull requests you know there's also just a lot of staring at something and figuring out if it is a bug or not or like answering somebody you know back and forth in an issue so I just thought that was really interesting I really appreciated it at the time because all of the open source stuff I did was so small and it was only me and so seeing someone maintain something big that everyone sort of had to collaborate on I thought was really interesting so I remember putting a comment on his YouTube video saying this is actually really cool maybe I could do the same for my embedded Hardware libraries because people are scared of those kinds of projects and maybe I can show people that it's really not a big deal it's just still JavaScript at the end of the day that you're writing so that was the kind of origin story of why I started I was literally like hey I found this useful maybe I'll do my own version of it that sort of sheds some of the intimidation factor for like a slightly different angle you know yeah and we didn't really even get into like your love of embedded development but like you've been very vocal about that um over the years like being really into like building things like physical Hardware like like uh you know I think you you had like the Ada of fruit like you know chip set of the month thing or something the box that they was in you that was so cool the monthly boxes yeah that was so cool yeah it fruit is like the raspberry pie company right like they they they ship out raspberry pies no that's element 14 but they do do they do make their own stuff yeah so they make their own boards and um things like that yeah ad fruit are amazing thing they based out of New York so and and you've got like quite a bit like I mean you're kind of blocking it in the frame for people who are watching the video they can see you got like a a detailed workbench like a pegboard is that like a some sort of like uh you know CNC machine or something or a 3D printer what is that big thing behind you the big boxy thing yeah yeah so that's a it's a 3D printer laser cutter and CNC machine in one um yeah it's really it's very big it's very heavy I had to actually um so I I bought that as an Ikea table you know with the legs and everything but I had to then go and buy a new tabletop like basically a huge slab of uh plywood from the hardware store and paint it just to be able to support the weight of it which is quite funny but yeah so um I am really interested in that I've always been interested in that and that's because of it again a teacher in my T course one day brought in an arcade cabinet that he built from scratch um and it was amazing it was like the sit down coffee table one and coil he showed us how yeah is that what they called a cocktail that's what they're called in the states like cocktail model it's like basically like PacMan or something where you got one controller on each side and the screen kind of flips depending on that's exactly what it was yeah yes yeah it was really cool um so he made one of those and he just asked people if they were interested to come in on a Saturday so we all came in on a Saturday and he just grabbed it out of the back of his car and he took the whole thing apart and showed us how it works and back then there was no Arduino so what you did was you took the circuit boards out of keyboards old recycled keyboards computer keyboards and then you just like kind of um hacked them and solded your own sort of uh wires to different you know parts of the keyboard Matrix and you use that to you know solder your joystick buttons and and things like that to the actual um yeah to the actual arcade machine and so you know he was showing us how to do all of this and he's like here's how to avoid all the ghosting problems on your keyboard because back then there were ghosting issues what is ghosting exactly I just thought that was the yeah so ghosting used to be a thing on um old school keyboards like the PS2 connected keyboards where because like keyboards are sort of like on a on a circuit Matrix if you pushed certain key combinations too fast you'd either get the wrong keystroke or you wouldn't the keystroke wouldn't register I can't remember exactly just cuz I haven't needed this knowledge for a long time but it was called ghosting where you'd either get the wrong key press or you'd get like another different random letter because of um certain letters having certain uh or certain Keys having certain relationships in the electronic circuit um where it would just cause issues so um I guess cross wires so to speak so it was really interesting so he would he would show us how to kind of pick the different letters on the keyboard to avoid the ghosting issues when people were playing a video game cuz obviously that would be very frustrating so sorry that was a really long story but that was sort of how I got involved in it and I remember I started like I started collecting all these old keyboards I was that person that was like yes and then I'm going to make something with them these you know and then a few years later the Arduino came out and I was like oh this this is what we needed this whole time so then I went and did an Arduino course in Sydney um and the rest was kind of History I think this was 2006 2007 I did that and then I just started playing with embedded stuff like in my spare time for for basically every year since yeah and so like even today you still will like bust out like gear and just start Hardware hacking yeah so I don't have a lot of time these days just cuz I went back to UNI which we'll talk about later but um I still like make stuff like I'm just going to grab something don't judge me cuz I'm wearing my slippers cuz it's cold no worries and I'm going to verbally describe so she's got a big room she's walking across it uh she's got again this beautiful white workbench uh with like perfectly spaced and like like very deliberately planned out like where you're going to put your drill and where you're going to put all your different you know screwdrivers and stuff it's a really cool looking U backdrop uh so she's back in her chair cuz a lot of people like half the people watch yeah sorry sorry sorry I didn't me interrupt you no no go on I was just going to say cuz like about half the people that listen to like maybe a little more than half of the people will just listen to the audio Edition like I just listen to the audio Edition um I don't usually watch the video but for those of people who are watching the video Edition yes we do have a video Edition on YouTube you can go there and you can see what su's background is or if you've got like a a phot if you want to just snap a quick photo of it I can just throw it up in the show notes and people can like link directly to the photo um yeah she's given me the thumbs up so it sounds like we're going to have a cool workspace photo we might if you take a good one like and we can get it into a square we could even potentially put you at your desk on the Instagram because Freo Camp does have an Instagram it's about you know I don't know we've got maybe like several hundred images of people in their work workbenches and stuff so proud of it um but yes what' you grab show us yeah so I'm really lucky to have that space behind me by the way um so I'll just describe it again for the audio people this is something that I made years and years ago but I actually got it out recently just to repair it because it broke when you know one of my moves that I did um so it's supposed to be like a a a um one to one size replica of the metro card from New York City subway so it's like a train ticket and so the actual silk screen on the um circuit board is supposed to look exactly like it you've got the magnetic strip here which is Sil silk screened in like a big white strip um and so it's got like a little greeting card sticker that sorry speaker that you can take just out of one of those musical greeting cards um and it has like a little um 3D printed sort of like gramophone style sort of you know that horn shape yeah so it's just supposed to play Train noises that's literally all it does um but it it sort of shows the different skills that come together right and why have a 3D printer just so you can do that um and you know the soldering iron behind me you know I use that to actually repair it so the speaker actually broke off um and the wire snapped as well so I resolder that together glued this back down with a little bit of super glue and then it's it's good to go again so so that's just an example little things like that will it work right now yeah I don't know if you'll be able to hear it cuz it's very soft CU it's not an amplified speaker okay the cling doors please that's pretty cool yeah that that came through fine I think so it just does the you know stand clear of the closing doors and that was a noise that I heard every day in New York City when I lived there so it makes me very nostalgic yeah yeah and I love it like on the note of geeking out about mass transit I love mass transit whenever I go to a new city I love to like just take their train system around of course I live in a city that doesn't even have a train system unfortunately well technically we do it's just like I I've never used it before cuz it only goes in like to certain parts of town that I've never even been to basically like you can take it to get to like the the fairgrounds basically where they have this the Texas state fair with the giant cowboy guy Big Tex but that's it and I've never got an opportunity to write it anyway sorry for the the you know tangent about mass transit but yeah like so you're building things uh you're you're F you're feeling inspiration and you're just like you have the skills and you have the gear to be able to like 3D print things or use subtractive you know um technology like CNC to get metal into a certain shape that you need it um so you you have your own kind of Hardware lab that you can go into and get things done with yeah that's what I call it behind me the lab yeah are there so what's the most ambitious Hardware project you've worked on um this is going to sound unexpected but I it was actually when I was working for Microsoft um I was trying to I was working with like a medical medical equipment company for the hollow lens okay I guess that's mic the yeah yeah so I would say that that's embedded because it was like an actual kind of wearable device right and we were trying to um basically set up like the beginnings of what sort of live streamed 3D virtual experiences right so let's say we had something so the hollow lens is not like the um some of the other virtual reality headsets um although it's mixed reality everything all the processing was on the actual device so you didn't connect it to a computer like the Oculus or whatever right so it couldn't you know it didn't have as much power as something like an Oculus Rift uh and so if if something if we had to do like 3D manipulations or something like that that were like really really processor intensive we couldn't do it on the device so we were trying to figure out a way to um use like streaming technology um and I think we were trying to do it over RTC I think um and directex we were trying to figure out how to actually like have this very sort of zero latency you know like the sensors in the hollow lands would would transmit over that RTC channel the data Channel over to the server then the server would use directex to render the actual 3D view based on how you moved your head and then like whip it back to the machine to render as quickly as possible and so I thought that was probably one of the more challenging things that I've worked on because I had to like learn a I mean I'd never worked with RTC before um and I just had to just really think about how to optimize things as much as possible and just the concept of realtime streaming was sort of new back then you know I don't think stadia was was a thing and I don't think Amazon's version of game streaming was a thing so for us we were like is it even actually possible like are we going to achieve the latency we want without making people feel motion sick right with that sort of slight delay so I thought that was actually a really interesting project that I worked on yeah what was the result were you able to figure out a way to do it in a way that didn't make people emotion sick yeah so we were able to finish the Prototype and the job that I was in at the time that's all we kind of got to do yeah we're like here's the Prototype we've validated it and then you just kind of move on so I'm not sure what actually happened to that given that it's proprietary and sort of like not sort of public so yeah yeah you've worked at a lot of big tech companies and I will get back to live coding but like since you mentioned you're work at Microsoft you worked at like was like a funny thing that her sister had done she' worked at like all the different fan companies but uh what was your time as zos like yeah not a lot of people ask about that so I appreciate that um it was my first job in the US and I was moving to Las Vegas so like there weren't really a lot of places to apply for jobs there and I was just like I someone told me about Zappos because they're just being bought by Amazon they're not a thing in Australia you don't like order from zappos.com or anything and they're just like oh it's sort of a bit cooky there it's quite creative you know I think that it fits your personality you should totally apply and it was a total moonshot um but I managed to get a job there and I was there for almost 4 years and it was wild um probably one of the most formative jobs that I've had in my career just because of the timing of it and when it was good it was really good um a lot of the Amazon stuff started some of that culture started seeping in towards the end which was why I left but the first 2 or 3 years were again just really formative very influential on me the front end team there at the time was world class I mean like world class um you know they cared a lot about performance which is something that I'd never really had to um worry about in my career to a degree like I worked for mostly advertising Consulting so you just created a website for your client and then you handed it off and you never saw it again you know and they were very simple websites they weren't super JavaScript heavy maybe some Google Maps and that was about it um and so I hadn't really written a lot of JavaScript either so I wouldn't know the first thing about performance and so I learned so many things in that job and the frontend team were just so talented and so nice um and so inspiring and so I think that was when I went from just stumbling through my career to oh I actually want to be on this level I want to be at this caliber and it really sort of P me to improve a lot so um even just outside of the really cool culture of Zap where it's very creative or the meeting rooms really zany and you know the CEO uh at the time was was quite a character I just found it really inspiring because of the frontend team like they've really brought me up to the next level of skills yeah so it what was it like moving to the states I mean a huge proportion of the people listening to this podcast are from overseas and a lot of them would love to come and work for one of the big frankly like highpaying US tech companies because uh Americans may take this for granted that like tech jobs just pay a a lot of money uh often like a lot more than you know working in accounting or working in other not like non software engineering fields of engineering for example um but like moving to the US from Australia like there are lots of cultural differences even though you got the same language and everything like had you been to the US before you came to uh apply this was your first trip to the US really no um I'd been to I've been overseas once I went to venatu which is just an an island off the you know a few hours from the coast of uh Northeastern Australia no I'd never been to America um my partner scored a job in Nevada and so it was more just like we were going for his job but I quickly discovered that you can't just move to America like you sort of have to have a Visa and that usually means you have to have a job um and so that was the reason why I moved overseas um but yeah the I actually took a pay cut um because at the time like Nevada was really low cost of living and the front end engineers at zapo weren't valued in the same way they they were seen as less technical than the backend Engineers so we got paid a lot less than some of the other Engineers of the company they then corrected that a few years later but I took a pay cut actually to go work in America which I know is not the usual path but after that obviously like my the the jobs I got after that and especially at some of the larger tech companies obviously I started earning a lot more money there so it was a wild experience to go from you know being on a salary that I was relatively comfortable with but had to sort of budget carefully and things like that right and couldn't live outside my means to then being on salaries that were just almost uncomfortable for me me you know because I just thought it was so much money um really wild experience very challenging to get through the first set of immigration paperwork as well I wasn't prepared for that and that was quite stressful so for anyone who has that in mind that's something to expect how long did you live in the US total 12 years I think yeah did you get did you apply for like a green card or any sort of permanent residency or did you always have the plan to go back to a Australia yeah it sort of flipflopped a lot when I first moved there it was only going to be for a year and then I thought I'll stay a few years but I'm definitely going back um and then I kept staying and I've been in some longterm romantic relationships over there right so if I was in a longterm relationship at the time I thought oh well this sort of has given me some incentive to actually stay um and so at some point you know I did start working on a Green Card application just to make things a bit easier for myself because it's really stressful to know that when you lose your job or if you quit you need one immediately or you have to basically Deport yourself um and I found that enormously stressful it was always a big thing in my head I felt like I couldn't really buy property or do anything permanent there until I had that permanent residency so I did actually spend a number of years trying and failing to get a green card it's not as easy as it sounds and some people just have a much harder time than other people sometimes it's just really bad luck but I never really got there so for that entire 12 years I was sort of precariously on a a work visa but I think that's very normal for people from um countries like India where the Green Card applications are oversaturated in for their quota um so it's not as if you know that's a unique experience I know some people that are waiting you know 20 to 30 years for their green card so um I don't want to trivialize that either but I was in a similar situation where I just felt like I kept running into dead ends or you know the pandemic happened which put a hold on a lot of um Green Card applications I know that right now because of all the layoffs in Tech most companies have to pause their Green Card applications for everyone because the Market's too saturated with um American citizens so uh because of the process you can't justify hiring somebody from overseas so it's it's just a very fraught process um but I did try uh to get there it just didn't happen so yeah yeah I mean how do you feel I mean it's not too back too bad of a fallback plan moving to the world's most livable City where you happen to also have grown up I was going to say yeah yeah I come from a lot of privilege and so you know there was a point where I realized that it wasn't worth all the tradeoffs but also I come from an an amazing country and so you know having that up my sleeve was always something that was obviously very comforting for me so yeah that helped a lot thank you for bringing that up yeah uh so again you worked at a lot of big tech companies you got to like learn JavaScript from people who were underappreciated by you know do you know when you started actually live coding 2016 I think I think 2016 yeah yeah something like that um yeah no I just gave it a go and I just told a couple of people on social media and my family I was doing it and I think like three to five people showed up for that first one and uh I remember rehearsing it the night before cuz I was so nervous to Live code um I was like oh I need to actually have some idea of what I'm doing otherwise I'm just going to like draw a massive blank so uh yeah that was sort of when I started and then I ended up just finding it a really good excuse to work on open source task that I needed to do but I didn't really feel like doing so that's kind of why it continued I was like oh this is actually like really helpful for me and hopefully if people watch that's a bonus so that was sort of how I got started with it yeah and maybe you can talk about what like a typical session would be like when you sat down and I realized that you haven't streamed in like 3 years if you go to to noop cat twitch.com noat uh which is your your old handle n o o p k a t I believe um y yeah uh there's it just there's like literally nothing there it just says last streamed three years ago and there's no like video on demand it's like it and I went there and I was just like I really wanted to watch your old streams in preparation for this but I don't I don't know if any of those were preserved anywhere is it just lost time or do you have like some hard drive with all the they're all on the hard drive um so I was very diligent about backing them up and things like that so they're not lost of time they're just not online so yeah yeah well um what was it like like the you did it for a few years I think uh like do you remember how regularly you were like how it progressed um just what the experience was like cuz live coding is seeing kind of a Resurgence like I was just talking with the primagen like last week and uh he he's a YouTube or he he records on Twitch and then he takes it chops it up and has an editor that puts it onto YouTube and he's very um I think deliberate about how he approaches it but um you know the way that you were doing it was it when I when I watched it back in the day it felt very very different vibe it was much more chill uh much less like social commentary it was much much more just like a a love of The Craft and just like focusing on the code I didn't it didn't seem like there were nearly as many memes or inside jokes or anything it just seemed very wholesome is that how you remember it yeah that's that's how I remember it I think it was different days back then but also I think I had different motivations but I don't want to speak for the other streamers so I W elaborate on that I just think that I came in with it with those different motivations I only did it once a week which is not something that twitch really likes to do they want you to do it more often but I just knew that that was sustainable 2 hours every Sunday morning was when I did it um and I usually so for the first few I would just pick a feature I wanted to implement in a open in an open source library then after that I was like I need to make this even more sustainable for myself and enjoyable and so that I don't have to spend hours grinding before you know to figure out what I want to do I would just literally like roll out of bed put clothes on put a put a little bit of makeup on and then show up and say all right let's look through the issues and maybe the night before if I was particularly drawing a blank on like I don't even know what I'd work on I'd go through the issues and you know on one of my repos and and sort of think okay has someone opened a poor request sometimes someone would actually open a PO request the night before and I could tell they would hoping I'd review it on the stream so you know I tried to sort of look for something to prioritize um you know as far as that went so it was a very different vibe um we did have only a couple of inside jokes but they weren't sort of we would always explain them and you know we they were very subtle anyway um and so it was just it was supposed to be cozy time it wasn't my intention I never really designed My Stream in to be a certain way I just wanted to show up be myself not be a character get some work done you know that kind of thing so yeah and it was practical in the sense that you were actually working on real stuff that you'd be interested in working on like even if you weren't streaming uh open source yeah yeah pretty much what role has open source played in your career and in your life a lot yeah I actually feel really bad because I when I so I streamed for 5 years and then I decided to just sort of step away um from it for a lot of different reasons um you know none of them were like really negative reasons or anything and I stopped working on open source too it's like I didn't have that sort of reason to get up and do it on the weekend so I feel bad I have stepped away from that a bit it is something I want to get back into this year um but it's had a huge impact on my life um in a lot of different ways and it's again it wasn't something that I designed I did open source because I saw other people around me doing it and I thought it was a really cool just Concept in general right and I thought it was again it was just a a very admirable um thing to do and I wanted to be sort of part of that and contribute you know my perspective on embedded software and things like that and and you know it's a really lovely way to meet a community um and hopefully Inspire other people too and so but through that you know I accidentally got introduced to all sorts of employment opportunities and even the live coding you know I had a couple of years in in developer relations as a result of that because people saw my stuff and reached out and wanted to hire me and so there was a lot of unintentional benefits to it a lot of amazing privileges that I don't think I would have foreseen that I know that some people we're getting into streaming now they do it with the aim of achieving those things because they can see that it's possible but it was very surprising to me how much the stuff I was just doing for myself ended up sort of being noticed by other people and and and opened a lot of doors for me that I didn't necessarily um you know plan for which is awesome but it's been mostly jobs and just meeting new people and being able to speak at conferences and all sorts of stuff yeah well I want to talk a little bit about like more recently since you stepped away from live coding uh you know recently you've gone and you've got like a whole lot of different CompTIA certifications you went back and you got like a proper like fouryear degree from Western Governor's University where Bo K's studied where several people who've been on the free cocam podcast got their undergrad in uh computer science uh maybe you can talk about like the back to school back like hitting the books again because you had like this pretty you were really high up in your career and from the outside from my perspective it sounds like you're like hey I want to climb down this ladder and I want to go climb up this ladder like this perched against a different bookshelf almost that that's kind of how I view it is that an accurate representation what was going through your mind you didn't want to like just stay in this one field okay sort of um I think that I see school in a different way to most people do I know that school is or school I guess college or university I know that it's very heavily um focused on like workplace career finding a job things like that um but I love learning and I love having a structured learning environment and because I had such an amazing experience with that tap course I just it just really engaged me um I still wanted to actually go and get a full degree so that is what's called an advanced diploma here um in interactive media that's what I technically have but it's not the same like I always felt like I missed out because I just like didn't end up going to college and getting an actual degree I just felt that that is a an experience for me that I would just really cherish and enjoy and and it had nothing to do with a career or anything like that it's just it felt like such a luxury Indulgence almost to be able to go to a place that is catering for you to learn things there are experts there that you can talk to to and it is a structured environment so that you understand what you you don't have to figure out what you don't know because a lot of the time you don't know what you don't know right and so someone is giving you that syllabus and saying here are the things that we think it's important for you to know and again that just felt like this huge Indulgence to be able to do and so I've been dreaming about going back to college for years and years and years and so cyber security was something I was really interested in but felt very intimidated by how broad and how huge and how deep it can go so I wanted to have that sort of expertise to sort of lead me and and give me the foundations I guess yeah what did you do like like describe kind of your path into cyber security from a more you know jack of all trades software developer type background yeah I think cyber security just kept coming up again and again and again um I think obviously it's become like a huge problem right like we've actually seen sort of the um the growth of things like ransomware and scammers and you know whing that even in the age of of you know generative AI now that's another tool that scamers are using it just kept popping up again and again and again and every time it popped up for me I just got like really excited um because I just thought it was really really fascinating and so you know I did OS training at uh zapo which I now know is a privilege that most workplace don't give their software Engineers they just expect you to know but when I started it was mandatory that I did an OAS training that was held on site at zapo and that was my first introduction actually to just hacking and threat actors and uh how you can manipulate websites to you know to gain things and that just blew the top off the lid off my brain you know and I was like this is just ridiculously cool I've never thought about software in this adversarial way and I was just obsessed um and so you know for years after that I just kept sort of reading different books you know I'd read like uh books such as cuckoo's egg which is an amazing sort of you know dramatized reenactment of um of you know something that happened at Berkeley um in California it was so cool and then stuck net I read about stuck net and I was like oh my God that's so cool um and so I just it just kept coming up as a reoccurring theme and with embedded iot stuff you know that iot devices are riddled with software um security issues and so it just kept popping up again and again and again in my career and and I'm interested in it enough on a personal level that I decided to go to school right just to actually finally learn what I could about it yeah and you also earned some certifications which I think is worth noting because a lot of people out there listening to this may be thinking about getting like some like the Security Plus or network Plus or some of I think they're all CompTIA certifications there may be some additional certifications from other vendors can you just like quickly rattle off some of the certifications you've earned over the past few years and what you learned from them what they involve for people that might be interested in getting them so just a disclaimer um all of those certifications were requirements for my bachelor degree in cyber security so WGU like puts a big sort of heavy um focus on getting indust certifications um which you know a lot of Industry actually recommends that students get that's what they desire in new grads especially cyber security new grads so I got um A+ I've always wanted to get my comper A+ actually and I I was so emotional when I finally got it um so A+ Network plus Security Plus um cyber analyst plus pentester plus um I got the um there were a bunch of other ones that I I ass squ um I think like secure it's basically the is ISC squ equivalent of Security Plus I feel so bad cuz now I can't remember them off the top of my head I also got project plus which is a project management one which was I actually found really interesting uh a lot of people hated that one but I thought it was useful because project management is useful in any kind of capacity right whether you're planning to move cities whether you're like you know writing software right so I found that really helpful so yeah just a whole bunch of them there were more I've just forgotten them so yeah and yeah the experience was really good what was the experience like like you just studied did you actually have to report to a physical testing center and like take a test with like some somebody standing over you to make sure you didn't cheat for one of them I had to um and that was the ISC squ one because they do like a palm vein scan to make sure that you are the identity you're saying w you are and I got sort of searched and I had to put my glasses on a tray and that to spin the glasses around to make sure that they weren't augmented glasses it was really intense but the the rest of them I actually did Via online proctoring and that's because I was doing that bachelor degree during the pandemic so CompTIA had actually pivoted to allowing people to test from home um so I don't know if that's still an option but it definitely was during the pandemic where they would install basically spyware software on your computer which sucked um and then you had to quit everything you had to show the Proctor that you weren't running any like cheating software or anything and then you would do your exam on the computer at home so I was lucky that I didn't have to find a testing center for most of them because I think that just adds extra stress yeah and uh so you finish the degree you finish these certifications you're going back into the job market but this time not as a general software engineer frontend developer like all the different things you were doing before but as an actual security researcher what was that process like and you know what was it like kind of assuming that new role and yeah it was really cool I think that um what gave me a soft Landing was that it was still a software role but I was just moving over to work for a research team um and so I'd be working with data scientists and um actual researchers with phds right in cyber security and things like that um and so it was more sort of a soft move over there and I got noticed because you know I was putting all these certifications on my LinkedIn and I was I was doing a security lead position at stripe at the time too so I was sort of trying to cut my teeth on more security focused roles so I sort of tried to just subtly transition and take on more and more in my current job and that's sort of what got me noticed um by my boss at crowd strike who actually cold reached out to me um and said would you be interested in you know applying for this specific job in research and it was threat hunting research specifically and so but when I joined um so I ended up applying getting the job and I joined crowdstrike and I can tell you that the bachelor's degree made my job so much easier even though I was still writing software I understood why I was writing things I knew how to use all the language and the words with the researchers and I could talk to the threat hunters and they'd mention like a hacking tool you know um they'd mention something like blood hound or they'd be talking about Mimi cats or something and like I knew exactly the even just the context of what that you know particular intrusion was that we were looking at um and that my software was trying to surface and so it was huge um it made me feel like I didn't just do that degree for my own enjoyment it ended up really just making my job much more fulfilling because I didn't feel intimidated and I I understood everything that was going on so that was a really really lovely transition that I made in my career where everything just lined up really nicely and you know the because I went so deep on all of the you know things in my bachelor degree I didn't just do things to pass exams I really engaged with things I played with the tools I really studied the certifications not for the certification but to actually learn something from the certification it ended up just being such a huge reward when I actually moved into a position like that yeah so it sounds like you're pretty happy with the transition like was it all sunshine and rainbows or like is the grass always greener on the other side like like what was it like being an actual security researcher working I mean you were working you say oh I took I cut my teeth on a job at stripe as a security leader uh what was it I mean that sounds like the type of job yeah I was the lead of my team yeah yeah but but like yeah it was it it was really more of a security Champion like you know there were security Champion programs in um different software companies where I was the tech lead of my actual team um of my software team but then everyone like the security team at stripe I did not work for the security team they wanted every team to kind of have a security lead so that were the representative for making sure that we were doing all the right things and that everyone was educated on the team when it comes to like good security practices and things like that just because otherwise they Spread Way Too Thin so that was where I could say I was cutting my teeth on something that was not super high responsibility but gave me an excuse to engage with the security team too and just like use the actively use the knowledge that I was studying in the bachelor's so that was it was actually one of the best transitions I've ever had in my career honestly like it just everything was just so lucky like when I moved over to crowd strike uh they write a lot of their software in go in goang and I learned goang at stripe and so the transition just could not have been nicer um especially given it was a remote job I was the only one in Australia working for that team at crowd strike so I really had to be quite selfsufficient even when I was ramping up because there wasn't always someone available to help me at the during the time zone um you know non overlaps I guess yeah is is crowd strike an American company sorry I know this is like a super ignorant question I could have just Googled but like uh pretty much every big company you worked at it sounds like has been an American company so you've always had to deal with the like I guess since you moved back to Australia you've always had to deal with this like substantial time difference I mean it's incredible time difference like I'm getting ready to put my kids to bed and you're literally waking up and it's like 8 a.m. there and you're you're kind of getting started with your day uh yeah so you had to learn a did you do a lot of this asynchronously do you think that a lot of your experience doing open source and doing communicating through GitHub issues and pquest and stuff was that helpful just having that experience communicating through open source for working remotely at an American company from Australia yeah 100% actually I've never drawn that link before that's very ex um that definitely helped me just being comfortable with asynchronous stuff and going to bed you know having left a message for someone and knowing that when you wake up in the morning they will have responded and just learning to be patient absolutely that was very helpful and um yeah I guess I've never thought about it before but that was very um very very similar experience um and you know in in open source sometimes you're just like well I'd open an issue but what if I just go splunking through the code base maybe I'll actually be able to find the issue and fix it myself and save everyone some time and then just open a poor request it's that same kind of thing where sometimes I'd have questions and I'm like screw it you know it's it's um like I would work from 700 a.m. my time till 300 p.m. uh my time just to get a bit more overlap with people in the states um you know I willingly did those hours but once you got to like noon my time I was like well I'm just going to smun through the source code because there's no documentation CU we're a research team you know we just have a lot of ephemeral stuff that we can't always be documenting so I'll just jump into the code base so yeah I think it was a very similar approach to that that it was to open source yeah how do you feel about like realtime communication tools like slack and things like that versus you know asynchronous communication like email and I guess ircc is more like slack but like uh systems where you communicate through the system like you open a ticket as opposed to just B you know jumping in and immediately talking to somebody in slack or something like that like do you do you think that what are your thoughts on that synchronous versus asynchronous question yeah I I don't like asynchronous at all um slack stresses me out but I think that's the case for just about everybody um I prefer real time at all times honestly um unless you know unless you need time to think so what was really nice was you know like obviously slack and emails and everything and meetings would all fall off at a certain point of my day so I would get a lot of focused time so I think asynchronous communication is really great for that where you don't you know my peers when I was studying cyber security um and so I took part in a lot of Collegiate ones actually so once for students so it's not as difficult um but also you can kind of Benchmark yourself against your your peers so I did a number of ctfs um which I really enjoyed uh it just gives you a chance to apply your skills and to see kind of where you're at and what you need to improve at and so yeah CTF stands for capture the flag and it's really just they're sort of just hacking challenges um sometimes your job is to defend something or to be um someone who reverse Engineers something so you're sort of on the the good guys side and then sometimes the um CTF events are about actually being the bad person um and you know being the threat actor and you have to try and hack into something and some are like both they're a mix you know and so I guess it's kind of similar to a software hackathon you know where there's a competition and you have to make an app this is sort of the infosec version of it where you have to apply your skills to either defend or attack something which is just really cool um and so I did code breaker which is put on by the National Security Agency the NSA n like the big bad NSA that everybody's terrified of yeah the NSA I'm going to guess something really funny for you to yeah okay so Su has gotten up from her chair she's running back to herbench to pull something off the pegboard so this is a fidget spinner from the NSA and this was what I got from them because I finished in like I was in the top 100 or whatever of their reverse engineering competition so that's my little um weird souvenir a lime green NSA fidget spinner have you taken it apart to make sure there's not like a microphone in there no but a lot of people have said that and I think it's really interesting I remember getting the um envelope in the mail the package in the mail and it just says like from National Security Agency and I think I put it on social media and I said oh well the found me it was nice knowing you all or something like that it's like every time you get a message from the IRS it's just like you you see that IRS that iconic you know typ face they use and you're just like your stomach just goes oh no you know then you open it and it's just like because I forgot exactly exactly so when it came I had a similar thought I forgot all about that I'd filled out my shipping address and everything and I was like what is oh and then I realized a second later so I definitely had that IRS moment where I was just like I hope this is what I think it is because I have gotten letters like that from the IRS and it's absolutely terrifying yeah awesome well I want I want to be respectful of your time I've got a lot of Rapid Fire questions I'm going to start asking if that's cool with you Su yes do it so just just to like kind of like uh recap your journey so far are so you you uh you started off with a computer in your house uh Commodore 64 The thankfully it was an older model and that was a that way you got to spend a lot more time in the command line and stuff like that that spurred your creativity you went on to study a great deal of different Technologies in as at a uh gosh what is the acronym T TEF T the uh Community t a f Ty yeah t a f and I I've written what that acronym stands for in here uh it stands for somewhere in my notes sorry I'm learning all about Australia um okay so I'm not going to Define that acronym I'm sorry I'll put it in the show notes uh but uh basically like community colleges so you went there and from there um you ultimately were able to work at advertising agencies you applied for a job in Las Vegas got to move and to the iconic Campus of uh zaposlite to Silicon Valley that was you know five or six hour drive away totes so you did that totes that's something only a Australians say like tot's cool am I am I correct like have you ever okay so if you ever hear an Australian cool oh is it British okay well um I've only heard so I didn't think we made it up okay yeah well um sorry if I'm uh attributing something to the Australian people that should be attributed to the Brits um okay so what I want to know is uh during your streaming back when you were live coding a lot you had this like very cool like first of all you got like beautiful taste in like mechanical keyboards and everything's like very elegant and uh like thoughtfully put together and and you know just like your your uh your background there uh with like like everything is very deliberately thought out in terms of your physical space but in terms of the software you use do you put a lot of time into customizing your tooling for when you're sitting down to write some code I do but then I just leave it like I'm not constantly tweaking it um yeah MP mpj from fun fun function back in the day I think he put it best like he stops himself doing it cuz he knows they'll just do it forever and it's just a distraction so um I've had the exact same Vim config file for years now years and years and years and years this probably hasn't changed in 5 years just set something up make it so that it's tolerable to you and then just let it go like you know that's sort of been my attitude it's not for every one but that's worked really really well for me so yeah it's just nice color scheme all of that it's got some of the basic tools that I need um and I don't try to customize anything to death anymore it's just frustrating to have to set up automated scripts to get it all back the way you want it when you have a new computer or if you know something happens and it's just a waste of time yeah so just good enough and then don't micromanage it anymore sounds like yeah and so you're yeah just leave it learn yeah if somebody wanted to learn them which is kind of like a a code editor that has a little bit steeper of a learning curve because you have to learn like all the keyboard uh shortcuts you got to learn like the different the three I think it's three different modes like insertion mode and you know like how would you recommend it like do you think it was worth learning it yes and no honestly I think it's like one of those huge it depends kind of things um if you do want to learn it you want to go C Turkey um I found it was very frustrating for 2 weeks but I wouldn't let myself go back to Sublime Text which is what I used to use just get through it um and I would say it's been really good because I do spend much more time on servers these days just like you know like into shell sessions and stuff like that it is so useful to just pop open vim and start typing but at the same time like Nano is there for people to use too and it's much easier to use so to be honest I wouldn't recommend it because it just depends on what you want to actually get out of something you know um I really enjoy it just because it feels minimal it uses not as not as much process as on my computer sorry not not as much you know resources on my computer but you know at the same time it's been a net positive for me but I wouldn't say you know it's been lifechanging I think I'm just such a casual Vim User it's not like the primagen or um Gary burnhard or other people who you you see they're just like total Wizards in it I don't know I just I'm not someone who's really obsessed about my editor it's just if it's good enough it's good enough so yeah yeah it's a bit of a nothing Burger answer but I just don't think it's worth it if you're already happy with your tool whatever you know well to quote something that you said that I thought was was kind of interesting uh that interesting enough to be written down and quoted on the free cam podcast you said don't put your identity don't put your identity into a single tool and it sounds like m yeah it sounds like that's the the vibe you're good like if the tool works well enough you know Nano I use Nano all the time when I go on servers uh you can just type Nano and it's built into like I think every Linux distribution uh and it's just like a emac like environment emac curiously isn't default in a lot of like different server versions of Ubuntu and stuff so I can't use emac when I go in there so I just use Nano which is very similar uh shortcuts and stuff but you know whatever gets the job done really at the end of the day right um and I want to like reconcile the so you have spent a lot of time Shoring up the foundational knowledge of computer science of how networks work uh you know security Concepts uh how computers actually work and it sounds like early on in your career you were working with like really powerful tools that were like highly abstracted away and now as you've Advanced your skills you've gone like kind of further down the the you know veritable stack of mattresses that the princess is lying on top of to see where the P's are you know um how do you reconcile the tension between wanting to get things done and also wanting to like further cement your understanding of fundamentals so you can get things done faster in the future yeah I think that's actually a really tough thing for anybody to manage including myself I don't have a great answer for it um I think for me what I find really enjoyable when you go deep on something is when you're not having to be constantly distracted by having to look things up or feeling like you're hitting a brick wall because you're just missing some foundations on something it's not enjoyable to go deep if you know that you're missing certain foundations especially like right around that particular topic area so I think the motivation for me a lot of the time now is to zoom back even though it feels awful to rip yourself out of that you know Rabbit Hole you're in it's it's the excitement of knowing that okay I'm going to fill in these foundations I'm going to find something super interesting while filling that in anyway so it's still going to be an enjoyable process and then when I actually go deep it's going to be so much more productive you're going to have this lovely intuition you're going to have those deep flow moments you know you're going to be playing the synth music and just like churning something out I think it's just you've got to find a motivation to enjoy those deep Dives way more because you're not feeling imposter syndrome and you're not just feeling like I'm never going to get this you know the foundations have just opened up so much in my programming world where I I can just like flipflop around and and just kind of dive in and out of different things now and I'm just not feeling like it's this awful kind of stumble in the dark um and so there are times when I still find it hard not to just go deep on something um but I think it's worth putting in the effort because things just feel way more effortless later on and it's really hard to give people this advice because it's one of those things where you don't get it until you actually do it um and so yeah it's it's really difficult for me to really give that advice just because you you don't know until you actually feel that uh and feel that reward of it sorry yeah when you were streaming for several years basically articulating your thoughts and like making them palatable you know as a teacher kind of like taking your thought process and Orting it uh uh verbalizing it do you think that that helped you um code better do you think or do you think like would you encourage people to like kind of think out loud while they're coding do you do you ever do that anymore is that like a habit like do you talk to yourself while you're coding or do you think that that slows things slows things down a lot yeah I'm I'm going to go out there and just say I think in general whenever I streamed on a Sunday as far as productivity problem solving challenge Factor it was net negative honestly you know I just sometimes it was nice to explain to other people and they they'd sort of give another perspective but a lot of the time because I had a lot of the domain knowledge of the embedded stuff like some people could jump in with like oh well what if you just like did a promise here instead or something like some of the JavaScript kind of side of things I would get some cool ideas from people but overall it was a net negative because I find it so hard to focus while I'm also talking I find it so hard to be kind of on the spot and have people watching me and so it's not helpful but the the thing that it did help me with was peir programming at work became like just not intimidating at all I'm like let's just jump into it and I was okay with saying I didn't know something and it gave me a lot more confidence with like working with other people because if you can live stream in front of a couple hundred people on a Sunday and make mistakes in front of them then you can pretty much just not feel afraid of of of working with any colleague after that in my opinion so it definitely helped with that I would say that that was actually kind of lifechanging to be honest um it made my daytoday work with other people much better cuz I used to feel very intimidated about coding in front of others um but the rest of it was honestly just a net negative yeah well it sounds like uh you did get something out of the process even if like those particular days like it was a lot of fun yeah yeah it was a lot of actual fun like we had heaps of fun I just meant programming wise and actually getting stuff done and things like that it was a bit of a a drag on that so there's the saying that like if you want to go far go together if you want to go fast go alone or something like that uh yeah I it's it's more interesting if you reverse it if you want to go fast go alone if you want to go far go together right and so it's kind of like you had the entire you know hundreds of people like cheering you on yeah s s s and like you're trying to you know close the pr or whatever right so uh yeah it sounds like the fact that you stuck with it for so long I mean you even I think I heard you built your own streaming platform or you started to build a streaming platform just because you were unsatis what was what's the story behind the sus Hinton streaming platform yeah I just thought that twitch was crap for software programming streams I'll just come out and say it's crap it's not good for that and also twitch incentivizes you know it's a it's a company that wants to profit so you know the profit incentives just created bad experiences especially for like programming streamers like I could talk to you about this for an hour so I won't um and so I just went out and wanted to create my own platform that respected the privacy of my users that didn't that allowed them to use emotes without having to sign up for a paid subscription you know so we could have her own inside jokes and things um that allowed me to just have all these different features that were useful for programming streams that twitch would never do right um and so there were just a lot of misalign incentives I felt using twitch as a platform uh and I I had enough of a community that I felt that they would be willing to make an account on my website and then actually watch me and and interact with me there and that they'd remember I was streaming there and things like that so I went out and started making that and then the pandemic hit right when I was getting close to releasing it and you know just obviously that just put you know a lot of different things in perspective and I put it down for a bit just because you know the pandemic was a tough thing to get through and by the time I was sort of coming out of that I wanted to stop streaming so it just never got released unfortunately but it was a really cool experience actually programming it yeah maybe it'll come back one day definitely and if if there's like an open source alternative that people can just self host a website and stream themselves on it I mean streaming has got to be expensive though in terms of like all the data that is involved and like like only a company like Amazon would have the coffers to be able to do that like economically like I I don't know how expensive it is to pipe HD video to like 200 people concurrently uh is that something where you think an individual Creator could actually run like a streaming platform like let's say it was like you know a selfhosted tool and you just threw up your server would would the bandwidth on that be like crazy or How would how would it work yeah that's a good question I ended up creating like a matrix in Microsoft Excel and I looked at every single streaming option everything from Amazon's own streaming technology uh to you know uh just like smaller companies that were offering at the time and all of the different features and whether or not they had closed captioning for the live streams whether you had video on demand all that kind of thing so I did actually do all the research and it is possible so I ended up standing up a very beefy machine I got a dedicated server in a data center um wasn't actually that expensive and then um I ended up H having like several hundred gigs of like bandwidth I think it was up to a terabyte of bandwidth or something like that um per month um and so and then I did a whole bunch of tests like I spun up kubernetes to create all of these like spontaneous you up to 500 connections to see if the box would stand up and if the traffic you know how much traffic that was generating and how much bandwidth and things like that so it's definitely possible because years ago I was able to prove that as a proof of concept in 2019 and I think the tools have gotten a lot better since then anyway so yeah the answer is yes it's possible you just have to do the research and be willing to have your own dedicated piece of metal so yeah have you ever heard of cloud flare TV it's like a 247 at the time but yeah yeah our 247 stream focused on technical topics and uh it's it's kind of like what you're talking about it's like a platform but it's really just cloudfl like I'm I'm you can just press play and you can watch people like live streaming their 247 and I think some of it's probably prerecorded it doesn't have chat uh but it is cool like the notion that like like I always fancied like free C Camp could have free C Camp TV and it would just be like an old school broadcast channel from you know the terrestrial you know uh satle like airwave you know like UHF if you ever saw the 1980s movie UHF where with weird inic like we could theoretically do that using tools that cloud fler has published but I still think that like what you're talking about is is a little bit different because it's like twitch in a box basically it sounds like yeah yeah I would be very interested if you do pursue that uh at some point or if you decide to get back into that project let me know I would be very interested in following that and uh I'll certainly try to help encourage people to uh contribute to it so what is on the horizon for Su Hinton what what are the big goals like we're basically out of the p pmic um you have an entire new skill set that you gain it sounds like you made Incredible use of that time uh what are your plans for the next few years yeah you kind of caught me at a Crossroads so I I I quit that job the research job um couple of months ago it was an amazing job um I just want to take a little bit of time off for myself that's all that was a very hard decision actually because I loved my team I just need some time off I I am carrying a little bit of burnout and I'm just finishing up my Master's Degree as well I'm working on my thesis at the moment so it seemed like good timing for me to just focus just on the thesis just spend a little bit of time like recouping um you know just being well enough again and things like that um so yeah like I'm keeping things open ended this year um I will be finished and hopefully graduating by July so that's actually not that far away it's May right now so I think 6 to 8 weeks I'll be finished with the master uh thesis and to be honest I'm trying to keep things open um and so I'll be doing a little bit of contract work for the rest of the year in software um and I'm looking to maybe start working on some online education courses because I'd love to get back into teaching so yeah just not putting a lot of pressure on myself but just getting around to personal software projects I've been putting off for years cuz I've been in school you know since the p mic started and and things like that so just you know sort of being able to slow down a bit and just come back to some of the things that are just really important to me um so that I can also just help shed a lot of the burnout of just working in the industry as well cuz this is my 20th year in the industry um you know it would be sadly it would be a bit strange if I didn't have a little bit of burnout at this point right yeah can you talk about like and I don't want to put you on the spot uh but can you talk about like how you sensed burnout was setting in like what was there some like moment that you just like damn I think I'm burning out or was it just like a gradual creeping process like be because I mean it seems like you have arrived at that conclusion I'm burning out I need to change I need to take some time off I'm curious for people that are listening to this who may also be closing in on a decade or two decades doing software development like how they can recognize this and know that they need to take time off before things get even worse yeah for sure it's a it's a really important question a lot of it is creeping up um but for me it was like a spike in anxiety every day when you just have to do normal things so if someone hits you up on slack and it's just totally normal it's they're not asking you for anything urgent they just want to talk to you and you just start feeling overwhelmed every time um or just it spikes your anxiety and you just you start withdrawing from people don't want to talk to them at work even though they're your teammates you just yeah you find yourself isolating yourself and then on top of that your productivity just takes a huge dive so you know that there'll be days where there'll be nothing wrong going in your life but getting out of bed is really hard and then you sit at the computer and you just don't do any work and you're just sort of your brain is screaming at you you're like we have to do something today and it just doesn't happen you know and then the next day there's a lot of pressure you feel guilty so you're able to kind of push through and and do it but it just feels everything just feels like you're walking through you know trying to get out of quicksand even though you're getting your job done it just feels so wrong and you're having to just absolutely force yourself and you're avoiding talking to anybody and everything just feels like a huge overload on you when it's just normal daytoday duties I think that was the first signs for me just total disengagement but you know obviously still trying your best to do your job because you need to make money to survive right um and it just feeling wrong even though you couldn't find any other reason in your life why you're struggling to show up every day if that makes sense yeah thank you for sharing that and uh what are some things you're doing now that you have some time to yourself like how are you kind of decompressing and like rejuvenating yourself uh and uh like I guess tending to that that wound of just burn out I guess that psychic wound mhm yeah I think I've just been a would trying to find Joy um so that when I start feeling better like I'm still engaged with the things I enjoy I haven't taken a total break from everything if that makes sense so I'm reading a lot reading way more um and I'm reading about things like Computer History um and just other things you know like um watching a lot of video game documentaries on how video games are put together like just and and watching a lot of creators on YouTube do what they love so just watching other people who aren't burned out or who I don't think are burnt out really engaging with the things they enjoy so that I can get that reminder of why I you know why I love being a software engineer or why I love doing embedded stuff or or why you know I have these hobbies that I have that I just don't feel like I can engage with at the moment so just trying to stay connected um but also trying to do low energy things like that right like reading a book or watching a documentary is is quite low energy it's forgiving yourself for not being productive but it's just keeping you connected all the same to the communities that you feel inspired by I think that's been the biggest thing I've been able to do so that I'm not just sitting around feeling sorry for myself if that makes sense or feeling guilty for it you know yeah yeah I mean that sounds great like I'll you know share that like I watch lots of documentaries on YouTube uh I I read a lot uh I go for long walks with podcasts and I attribute I guess my longevity which isn't as long as yours 20 like I I've been doing free cocing for like 10 years almost uh so I'm very much trying to Pace myself because I've had so many friends who've just hit a brick wall with burnout and uh but I'm it sounds like you're doing everything you need to do to recover so we're pulling for you to be like back to full power eventually whenever that is uh but um yeah thank I really appreciate you sharing that because in Tech we have this like kind of Mythos around like productivity and it's it's an American thing right America's obsessed with productivity uh and you know uh I don't know if that was like a cultural shock when you went to the US where everybody's like so focused on work and career defines who they are so much yeah I mean was there a moment huge uh it was really hot actually was there a moment where you were like a dinner party and like people asked you what you did and like like where you realize wow this is different from like where I'm from like people don't you know immediately the difference was was immediate um and just yeah just seeing seeing people really struggle to even like leave a job because they felt like their identity was in it or like people who try to build empires in jobs because that's like their identity it's just people's identity being so deeply embedded in not just like what they do for a living but also that specific company and the team or like the the project that they're on like people putting their identity into the specific project and them feeling bad if they're working on something that's not as exciting as their their as their other colleague is is you know working on something way cooler that really really shocked me I feel very very um grateful that that's not something that I've ever really had a problem with like I can see that and see it's unhealthy and I'm not interested and um it's just been it's just been a a huge contrast and and I don't think that I just don't think that I could ever really do that and again that's probably privileged to a degree but I just I turn off I want to do the best job I can within reason and then I want to be a really great teammate to work with but I just don't want to put any identity in it beyond that if that makes sense yeah but it it really threw me when I first moved there and some people did actually judge me for that they thought that I wasn't being a team player and things like that and but I would say that what I was doing was completely reasonable I wasn't slacking off or anything like that uh I was just being realistic yeah you weren't letting my opinion so you weren't letting work completely take over your life like a lot of people allow that to happen exactly like like your employer will let will take as much of your time energy as they can they'll put you on that fancy you know Google bus and and have you writing code while you commute instead of you know uh like like as much of your time and energy they'll serve dinner really late at night so you'll stay for the free meal so you'll work a little later right like all those little tricks that they do to get you uh or or they call the company a family instead of just being you know a team right um a lot of those things that are like I don't know if they do it I mean I think they do that in places like China and Japan and stuff like other countries that have unhealthy work cultures but uh but I'm hardened to hear that it it isn't like that in Australia right like not not to the extent it is in the US not to the extent it can be I think that I think that we all fall into the Trap I think that no country is really like completely immune it's just not to the same degree for sure so I definitely feel that I fit more into the C the working culture here um people are working a lot right now just because cost of living and and working is very stressful but it's just not the same identity entrenchment here um and yeah people do want to go home to their families and stuff like that so yeah well I don't us like I want to end on a positive note and not just on on like U you know American work culture and my beef with it and and you know burnout and things like that since you've been reading a lot of books we don't usually do recommendations since you've been reading a lot of books and you watch a lot of video game documentaries what are some recommends that you have for people who've listened this far into the podcast are there any channels that you just like love watching to fire you up yeah so um one of the main channels that I love so much is nerd Forge nerd Forge um I'll yeah I'll list all of these they just do really creative stuff I'm so into them I'm trying to figure out what the documentary one I watch I think it's called cut clip cut clip but I'm trying to remember the name of the channel I'm just scrolling through YouTube right now trying to find it for you while you're while you're scrolling for it I'm going to throw in one of my recommendations this channel is so great they do like Retro Gaming documentaries and they do like the best kind of like nostalgic 3D graphics and stuff it's called uh it's called splashwave and so they'll cover like how Sonic Sonic the Hedgehog was made you know talk about Michael Jackson's involvement in the development of the music and that he was like a huge fan of Sonic the Hedgehog and he actually approached him because he wanted to make that's cool uh or um they'll talk about uh you know the history of like different like Sega games different arcade games they'll talk about like the architecture that made certain arcade games possible and they they model all this stuff so a lot of the shots are like effect shots and stuff it's so cool and it's got like that that kind of like you know synth retrowave type uh sound going on so um yeah what are some other channels you recommend yeah so the the channel is no clip no clip um that's the Video Game documentary Channel yeah they are fantastic um and as far as books go right now I am absolutely loving the dream machine it's just it's such a good book um it's very dense and very long but I just it is it is the best narrative about just how Computing came to be um it's just an absolutely delightful read I've been really inspired by that so that's the main one that I'm reading at the moment but before that I read um space Rogue I think space Rogue that one is about you know the um original Cult of the dead cow um hacking group they're really really cool and so space Rogue was one of the um pseudonyms of the one of the members of the group I believe very cool yeah I remember believe I'm blanking on all of this stuff I remember the cult of the dead cow back in like the the BBS days and stuff we would they are so cool yeah yeah very cool dream machine space Rogue nerd Forge no clip I will second that I love the no clip Hades development uh series it's like four hours worth of like how they made the game Hades I think it is called Hades right like it's like a kind of isometric perspective where you're like zipping around and fighting like all these Greek gods and stuff it's cool um so Su I just want to thank you again for like 20 years in the field and you're still sharing your wisdom and uh I'm very excited to talk with you offline about like you know software development education that's something very passionate about and uh we will take as much Suz Hinton as we can on the free C Camp YouTube channel like publishing your tutorials anything we can do to help get that wisdom out there uh to as many people as we can freely um so I want to thank you again for making time to come on the Freo
