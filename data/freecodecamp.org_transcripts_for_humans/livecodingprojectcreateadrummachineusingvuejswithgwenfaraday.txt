00:56 - hi everyone welcome to another
01:00 - live stream
01:01 - um if you don't know me my name is gwen
01:04 - and i run another youtube channel called
01:07 - faraday academy where i do programming
01:11 - tutorials and live streams mostly mostly
01:14 - python and vue.js javascript topics
01:18 - so today is a continuation of building
01:22 - the free code camp projects live in
01:26 - vue.js so
01:29 - last week i did the markdown previewer
01:31 - and this week i'm going to go to the
01:33 - drum machine let me just zoom in here
01:36 - so these should be linked in the
01:37 - description below
01:40 - and you can go to my github which is at
01:42 - gwen f and this is called free code camp
01:45 - projects view and then i have each
01:47 - project in its own folder
01:50 - with a readme yeah so for today i'm
01:53 - going to be
01:55 - starting a view app with the vcli
01:57 - using incline which is a view ui
02:00 - framework
02:02 - for styling and design components that
02:05 - kind of thing
02:06 - and this is basically
02:08 - the
02:10 - um
02:11 - mock-up for the drum machine
02:13 - now i did find sounds for this already
02:15 - just because i didn't want to be
02:17 - scrounging for sounds here
02:19 - so i came up with these sounds that i
02:22 - edited
02:23 - myself but they're in the wrong format
02:26 - and won't play in the browser for some
02:27 - reason
02:28 - so i ended up
02:30 - getting some random sounds
02:33 - in this
02:34 - clip.js file here
02:36 - so they won't sound exactly like a drum
02:39 - so it's going to be more like a sound
02:40 - machine
02:42 - than a drum machine
02:45 - yeah
02:47 - that's a horse
02:48 - so if anyone has better sounds uh let me
02:51 - know but these were the easiest they're
02:53 - just mp3 files from sound bible
02:56 - which
02:57 - sound bible has all these um
03:00 - free sounds
03:02 - sometimes you have to give
03:03 - attribution and sometimes their
03:06 - public domain so it depends which sound
03:09 - just
03:10 - one second
03:13 - i'm gonna pull up the chat real quick
03:19 - and
03:29 - and
03:31 - okay
03:33 - good
03:34 - let me see
03:36 - who's here
03:38 - if you're here go ahead and say hi and
03:40 - feel free to
03:42 - give me comments or recommendations as
03:45 - i'm going along with the live stream
03:49 - this will be interesting because i
03:51 - generally don't work with
03:54 - sound
03:55 - in the browser when building
03:57 - applications but there's also a couple
03:59 - other applications i want to build with
04:00 - sound in the future like a music app so
04:04 - uh hopefully
04:07 - uh
04:08 - hey tech stats hi
04:10 - sassy
04:12 - uh yeah thanks for joining me feel free
04:14 - to
04:15 - um chime in as i'm programming today
04:19 - all right
04:20 - so
04:21 - yeah there's a couple other sound apps i
04:22 - want to build in the future so this
04:24 - should be
04:25 - a good project to
04:27 - i guess lean on later
04:29 - so first thing
04:31 - let me start here so first thing i need
04:33 - to create a view app so i already have
04:36 - the view cli installed
04:38 - so i'm going to do view
04:41 - create
04:45 - and let's call this
04:49 - drum machine i guess it's in a folder
04:51 - called drum machine so maybe i'll just
04:53 - call this
04:54 - drum app
05:00 - all right and it should give me my
05:01 - options yeah
05:03 - so
05:05 - let's see do i want anything let me just
05:07 - go into manual
05:10 - um
05:11 - do i want progressive web app support
05:14 - that's easy to add later
05:16 - i don't need routing it's just going to
05:18 - be one page this time
05:20 - view x
05:21 - don't think so
05:23 - do i want sass um i think i'll be okay
05:26 - without sass
05:29 - let me put it in just in case
05:31 - and i'm not gonna do testing
05:34 - so i'll use regular dart sass
05:39 - eslint i'm going to do just the basic
05:41 - island seems to go better in live
05:43 - streams when it's not
05:45 - giving me errors all the time
05:48 - lint on save
05:51 - yeah that's good
05:52 - and then i want dedicated config files
05:56 - save the preset no
05:59 - all right so that's installing
06:05 - what's the difference between sass and
06:07 - dart sass they're both implementations
06:09 - of sass
06:10 - i think dart sass is the most popular
06:12 - and i want to say it's the fastest
06:15 - but
06:16 - i'm not sure anymore
06:18 - um
06:19 - i think it's just what most people use
06:22 - like there was
06:24 - i guess ruby sass and
06:28 - a couple other projects sas built in
06:30 - different ways but it's the same
06:33 - implementation
06:34 - the only i guess the only two different
06:37 - types of sas are indented syntax and
06:40 - the
06:42 - scss style
06:45 - and those
06:46 - and you can use either of those styles
06:48 - with any of the
06:49 - implementations
06:55 - um
06:59 - all right
07:02 - should be done in a minute
07:20 - okay
07:25 - it's installing
07:35 - booking generators from the plug-ins
07:37 - that i installed
07:40 - which is just sas oh i guess i did
07:42 - babble too
07:46 - which is just one of the default ones
07:50 - i just launched to if you're interested
07:52 - in view cli plugins i just created a
07:54 - video on my channel faraday academy
07:57 - where i show how to create
07:59 - plugins and kind of how they work under
08:01 - the hood
08:03 - um it was pretty interesting for me to
08:05 - learn about so maybe you'd enjoy it too
08:08 - all right so now
08:10 - let's see
08:11 - now i have
08:14 - oh wow so
08:15 - drum machine
08:17 - i thought i was inside of drum machine
08:19 - already so drum app i'm going to move
08:21 - drum app inside of the drum machine
08:22 - folder now
08:24 - so
08:25 - let's see because all the other apps are
08:27 - inside of their their folders
08:30 - for that app
08:32 - so move drum machine to
08:35 - no move drum app to drum machine
08:40 - okay
08:42 - so now
08:43 - yeah i only have the three folders one
08:45 - for each project
08:46 - and now if i
08:48 - uh cd into drum machine
08:52 - cool i see drum app so let me open this
08:55 - in the code editor then
09:00 - go in here
09:02 - and then i'll also go ahead and cd into
09:06 - um drum app
09:10 - and then i'm going to start my view
09:12 - server
09:13 - so
09:14 - npm run server
09:23 - all right and that always takes a minute
09:24 - to build
09:29 - and let me put my browser in the middle
09:31 - all right
09:32 - so now that's building and actually
09:34 - first i'm going to install the
09:37 - incline library
09:39 - and probably the best way to do that is
09:41 - through
09:42 - the cli install
09:44 - so
09:45 - i'll just add this
09:48 - real quick so
09:51 - then i'm gonna have to rerun
09:54 - uh uncommitted changes yeah that's fine
10:02 - okay
10:03 - so that should only take a second to
10:05 - install
10:06 - and set it up for me
10:08 - what's nice about using the vue cli
10:11 - plugins is that they set up all the
10:12 - configuration
10:14 - so i can just start
10:16 - using the components without setting
10:18 - anything else up
10:22 - okay so
10:24 - first thing i'm going to do is set up
10:26 - the grid
10:28 - so
10:31 - let me go to the drum machine mock-up
10:34 - so it's a pretty simple mock-up i just
10:36 - want
10:37 - basically this box to be centered and
10:39 - then i want a panel on top
10:42 - that i guess has some controls like you
10:44 - can turn it off and on
10:46 - there's some volume
10:48 - in the name of the sound that's being
10:50 - played which i just gave them names and
10:52 - objects so that have a name
10:56 - and then
10:58 - each one of these
11:00 - panels or buttons or whatever they're
11:02 - going to be
11:03 - um
11:04 - when you click on it it'll make that
11:05 - sound
11:08 - um okay
11:10 - successfully invoked okay so now incline
11:14 - is installed i don't think i need to
11:16 - install anything else right now so i'm
11:17 - just going to do
11:19 - npm run serve to start the development
11:21 - server
11:22 - and then i'll be able to see my app
11:25 - localhost
11:27 - 8080.
11:33 - okay
11:34 - and in my source directory i want these
11:37 - clips this clips.js file so i'm just
11:39 - going to drag that in here
11:42 - let's see yeah i'll just put it in the
11:44 - root for now
11:47 - um
11:51 - all right
11:52 - let me see
11:55 - and my server's not running
11:58 - let's see
11:59 - module build failed
12:01 - compound selectors
12:03 - may no longer be extended
12:08 - hmm okay so this is
12:14 - an
12:15 - incline problem
12:17 - i already have an error
12:18 - but where is this coming from
12:22 - um it's coming from the actual incline
12:25 - components
12:28 - so in the node modules i don't know if
12:30 - there's anything i can do about it
12:33 - except maybe
12:34 - downgrade my version of incline
12:38 - balsamic
12:40 - so let me see
12:41 - balsamic
12:43 - balsamic mock-ups is i think it's a
12:46 - super easy
12:47 - tool for
12:48 - developers people who aren't
12:50 - professional designers to just quickly
12:52 - make mock-ups they have an online
12:54 - version now
12:55 - um
12:57 - but
12:58 - i have the desktop app because i like it
13:00 - a little bit better
13:02 - but they both work i think the online
13:03 - one's a subscription model
13:06 - okay so
13:09 - root style sheet
13:12 - consider extend to
13:17 - yeah so this is a problem inside of the
13:20 - incline library let me go to their
13:23 - github page
13:26 - and look at their issues and see what
13:27 - people are doing i'm sure someone else
13:29 - has had that issue
13:31 - because that's literally the first thing
13:32 - i did when i set up the app
13:40 - i wonder
13:44 - let's see
13:46 - yeah let me copy this
13:48 - component selectors may no longer be
13:50 - extended
13:57 - okay
13:59 - so this is a recent issue
14:04 - yeah it seems like it's the same thing
14:06 - that i'm having
14:09 - this shouldn't be happening on a clean
14:11 - installation
14:14 - which version of node sas
14:18 - okay
14:19 - so
14:22 - what i might do actually
14:26 - is
14:30 - all right
14:32 - so let me see
14:37 - read me
14:40 - saurus public okay
14:43 - um
14:44 - let me see
14:47 - so it's setting up incline importing
14:49 - incline components registering them
14:53 - so what i might do is
14:56 - i could just uninstall incline
15:00 - and then get rid of the plug-in
15:03 - and then manually add it because what
15:06 - might be causing the error
15:08 - is
15:10 - let's see
15:13 - let me go back to getting started
15:17 - is that i
15:18 - gave it this customizable flag
15:23 - oh let's see and its dependencies have
15:25 - been added to your package.json
15:28 - node sas and sas loader let me just
15:30 - check the versions of those real quick
15:35 - let's see
15:39 - um sass loader and node sas
15:44 - okay
15:47 - and then
15:49 - yeah i have incline
15:52 - and of course the plug-in that installed
15:54 - incline
16:03 - so it's a sas problem okay
16:06 - so i wonder
16:08 - if i restart all of this
16:14 - and i'm going to try this out again
16:15 - later to see if i should open a bug or a
16:18 - new issue with this
16:21 - uh because i literally didn't do
16:23 - anything after
16:24 - i set this app up so it shouldn't be
16:26 - giving me an error already
16:31 - okay so
16:34 - if
16:40 - shaking
16:42 - let me look at the getting started
16:50 - i wonder if i just do this instead
16:55 - if i'm not
16:57 - importing certain components or passing
16:59 - in any options
17:01 - what that's going to do
17:05 - it's rebuilding
17:09 - nope it's still doing it
17:11 - so yeah it's a sass problem
17:16 - so i wonder if i should be using ink
17:18 - line
17:19 - i just used this in the last project and
17:21 - it worked totally fine
17:23 - so
17:25 - all right so i guess i'm going to be
17:26 - using a different framework
17:29 - um let me try
17:32 - um
17:34 - view bootstrap that should work
17:40 - and we can start all over again
17:42 - read this solution in a github issue
17:47 - you mean on incline
17:52 - i think i went i didn't see any of the
17:54 - issues
17:58 - that had to do with mine it was just
18:00 - that one closed issue where there was no
18:02 - solution
18:05 - oh if you tried to post a link i don't
18:07 - think free code camp is letting you post
18:09 - a link so i can't see it
18:11 - um can you just tell give me the issue
18:13 - number
18:15 - and
18:17 - okay
18:18 - and point
18:20 - node sas from the webpack
18:23 - like this conses equals require node sas
18:29 - let me see
18:30 - let me look at the issue
18:37 - customizing not working
18:41 - um okay let me see
18:45 - is issue 170
18:54 - oh this is a next though
18:59 - getting a compile error
19:01 - module
19:02 - whoops module build failed
19:09 - bug report okay
19:12 - yeah this is what i have okay
19:14 - yeah this is the same issue though
19:18 - so i don't know which one it's which
19:20 - issue unless you give me an issue number
19:22 - i had to remove sas default dart sas
19:26 - to point at node sas
19:28 - um
19:30 - let's see
19:32 - transpiling dependencies
19:37 - i could
19:38 - point it i don't know do i want to do
19:40 - this i kind of want to start just
19:42 - building the drum app i think for this
19:45 - um i can change it later but
19:48 - i think right now i'm just going to use
19:50 - bootstrap view
19:51 - until i figure out
19:53 - what's wrong with incline
19:57 - [Music]
20:02 - and i don't believe
20:06 - i believe this is just an npm install
20:11 - let's see
20:14 - yeah so it's
20:16 - it's not recommending me to
20:22 - you are using okay so i have to install
20:24 - bootstrap view and bootstrap okay
20:29 - icons plugin
20:32 - all right
20:33 - so let me just install this real quick
20:37 - and this will just i just need a basic
20:39 - grid system and some styling that's
20:46 - it okay
20:49 - um
20:50 - that's installing
20:52 - so there's no plugin i just have to
20:55 - set it up in my
20:57 - view file
20:59 - in my main
21:00 - view file where i render from
21:03 - so main.js
21:05 - and i'll put it in here
21:10 - okay
21:12 - and then
21:13 - i guess i'll just get rid of these and i
21:17 - could uninstall
21:19 - incline from here
21:24 - and install incline and the plug-in
21:32 - okay cool that installed just fine so
21:34 - i'm gonna do an npm uninstall
21:37 - the plugin
21:39 - and
21:42 - uh
21:44 - let's see
21:46 - ink line
21:53 - view is imported twice now
21:56 - i might have done that yeah
21:58 - okay
22:00 - thank you
22:02 - and actually
22:04 - i'm gonna change the order of those
22:05 - imports
22:08 - all right
22:11 - and now
22:12 - okay so import bootstrap view and then
22:17 - just view dot use
22:20 - okay let me do bootstrap view
22:24 - and then if i want icons later i'll do
22:25 - that
22:30 - okay
22:31 - and now i'll do npm
22:34 - run serve
22:37 - and i think
22:39 - so incline's a pretty lightweight
22:42 - um
22:44 - library so i don't think it gave me
22:46 - extra setup like some of the
22:50 - larger ui libraries did yeah i don't see
22:54 - its own folder or anything here
22:56 - so i think i got rid of it
23:01 - yeah it doesn't even change the setup in
23:03 - the app.view file okay
23:07 - icon's plugin is defined but never used
23:09 - yeah
23:11 - all right so
23:14 - um
23:16 - i'll just add it
23:20 - okay so that built
23:23 - okay cool
23:24 - it's working now
23:26 - and i guess i'll just be using the
23:29 - view bootstrap system
23:33 - um
23:35 - okay so
23:37 - components
23:38 - actually i think
23:41 - grid yeah layout and grid system
23:45 - so
23:46 - it's basically all prefixed from b
23:48 - container b row
23:50 - and
23:51 - just by
23:54 - i think this gives me all the components
23:56 - like i don't have to individually
23:58 - import and register components because i
24:00 - just registered the whole library
24:02 - so let me try out i'll just start
24:04 - programming in
24:06 - my main file
24:08 - my main app.view file and then i'm going
24:10 - to break up
24:11 - components as i need them
24:14 - break things up into components
24:17 - let me get rid of all this styling too
24:22 - okay
24:23 - so
24:26 - first thing i'm going to do is a v
24:28 - container
24:29 - to start off my grid system and then
24:33 - uh oh wait it's b
24:35 - i'm getting all these
24:37 - uh libraries confused
24:39 - so for bootstrap it's b
24:43 - and
24:44 - b okay and then
24:47 - it will be
24:48 - b
24:49 - row inside
24:52 - and then
24:55 - b
24:57 - column
24:59 - i think it's just call
25:02 - yeah be call
25:04 - okay
25:08 - and then here is where i can put it in
25:11 - the middle of the page so let me put
25:12 - something in here first
25:14 - just some text
25:17 - okay drum
25:19 - and now from here
25:21 - i can give it the
25:22 - regular classes
25:25 - so
25:26 - or maybe there are props here
25:28 - let me
25:29 - look in
25:30 - columns
25:34 - yeah so i'll pass it in as a prop
25:37 - instead of as a class
25:39 - so
25:41 - i'll do column for so this will just be
25:44 - for all screen sizes so six six columns
25:47 - wide
25:48 - and then
25:49 - how do i do offset
25:52 - okay offset equals
25:54 - so
25:55 - i think i can just do offset equals
25:57 - three
26:03 - all right so that didn't work
26:06 - um
26:08 - so first let me see if there's an error
26:10 - here
26:14 - uh type checked for prop
26:17 - call
26:18 - expected boolean got string
26:21 - with value of
26:22 - six um oh i think it's calls isn't it
26:28 - i think it is calls let me see
26:32 - yeah calls
26:34 - so
26:36 - here
26:37 - calls
26:44 - okay so that didn't give me an error but
26:47 - it's still
26:51 - let me just see
26:53 - if i inspect this
26:55 - let me inspect the text
27:01 - okay
27:02 - so row container
27:06 - [Music]
27:07 - class
27:15 - of column six
27:17 - and
27:19 - i wonder why
27:21 - they have examples they don't really
27:23 - have
27:24 - oh they do okay
27:27 - um
27:30 - let's see
27:32 - yeah this one says calls eight
27:37 - so i should be able to do that let's see
27:39 - i have
27:40 - b column
27:42 - so
27:43 - b call b call
27:45 - and then calls of six and then oh my
27:48 - offset is wrong
27:49 - ah
27:52 - yeah thank you
27:56 - that's so strong okay
28:06 - it's still not working
28:08 - um
28:09 - so let's see offset
28:12 - why wouldn't offset be working
28:16 - did i have an example with offset
28:25 - they do have
28:27 - [Music]
28:29 - auto so i think that centers it
28:35 - and
28:38 - alignment
28:40 - i guess that's flexbox
28:44 - so you can use flexbox
28:50 - let's see
28:52 - all right so offset let me just try to
28:55 - do
28:57 - um instead of just general calls let me
28:59 - try to do a small
29:01 - and then i can do
29:04 - offset hyphen
29:06 - small
29:10 - see if that works
29:17 - that's weird
29:22 - recall
29:24 - medium offset medium
29:27 - i'm closing the column
29:30 - uh
29:31 - all right so let me put content in here
29:33 - and see if i just
29:35 - if something else is going to
29:39 - change it i guess
29:41 - because that's weird
29:45 - yeah i'm doing it exactly like the
29:47 - examples say let me even copy paste
29:51 - the example
29:54 - and
29:57 - let me do another row so
30:03 - all right
30:04 - oh wait i wanted to put a row in here so
30:06 - b row
30:10 - and then
30:13 - let's see
30:19 - maybe the css is not being loaded
30:22 - correctly
30:24 - yeah that's true because it's not
30:26 - working at all
30:28 - does it say because i didn't think it
30:30 - said i thought
30:32 - um
30:34 - let's see
30:48 - oh it does say to add imports
30:51 - so
30:52 - add import
30:54 - bootstrap view
30:57 - okay
31:04 - so let me put this in the main.js file
31:09 - and that should fix it
31:13 - ah
31:14 - okay
31:16 - all right that was
31:18 - a lot of time spent on that
31:20 - thanks for the help okay let me get rid
31:22 - of that extra row then
31:25 - okay
31:27 - and
31:29 - yeah
31:30 - oh man i guess i've
31:34 - like i'm so used to setting it up
31:36 - um
31:37 - setting up component libraries
31:40 - just by using
31:41 - a plugin so i do view add and then it
31:44 - sets it up for me so i forgot i can't
31:47 - believe i forgot to check for the css
31:50 - um all right so now
31:52 - finally i have the drum machine so this
31:54 - is actually going to be
31:56 - two cards
31:58 - so
31:59 - the top card and the bottom card with
32:01 - the
32:02 - um
32:03 - sound buttons oops
32:06 - with the sound buttons or whatever these
32:08 - are inside
32:09 - so
32:10 - let me look for cards here
32:18 - okay cards
32:20 - so just a basic card
32:23 - and then i guess i can nest inside the
32:25 - cards with text or just
32:28 - put components directly inside
32:33 - all right so
32:34 - let me just start off with the basic
32:35 - card
32:37 - so
32:39 - b card
32:41 - and then close it
32:44 - and then oh yeah second one
32:48 - so now i have two
32:50 - and
32:52 - let's see let me start to put
32:55 - the controls inside
32:58 - so
32:58 - actually
32:59 - i put volume in the mock-up here but i
33:01 - have no idea how to do sound volume in
33:04 - the browser
33:05 - so
33:07 - yeah i'll have to figure that out um
33:10 - power should be easy just make it work
33:12 - or not work
33:14 - and then the sound name should be easy
33:16 - so let me
33:18 - uh let's see
33:21 - so let me do
33:22 - what do you call those things switches
33:26 - switch style
33:28 - uh check box
33:33 - um
33:37 - yeah that looks okay i don't know why
33:39 - it's so small
33:46 - oh that goes into other so here are just
33:48 - the switches
33:51 - this
33:54 - okay so i can put a prop large i'm
33:56 - definitely going to put a prop large on
33:57 - that
33:59 - so it's just a prop that denotes it as a
34:02 - switch
34:03 - so it's a regular checkbox and then you
34:06 - pass it a switch prop and it makes it a
34:08 - switch
34:10 - okay so
34:12 - oh cool and then it'll just give me the
34:14 - label so i guess i'll put the label to
34:15 - the right that's fine
34:18 - um
34:20 - i'm not really picky about that
34:23 - so
34:24 - a lot a large switch and i'll call it
34:26 - the power switch
34:30 - so let's see
34:32 - cool so that switches on and off
34:38 - all right
34:40 - um
34:43 - now what was the next one oh a slider
34:46 - for volume so let me try to find a
34:48 - slider
34:52 - do i call it a slider
34:55 - um
34:56 - it's not a carousel
34:58 - i mean it would be in forms
35:00 - somewhere maybe if i scroll does anyone
35:04 - know what that's called
35:11 - which is
35:18 - all right maybe
35:19 - i mean view bootstrap might just not
35:21 - have that
35:24 - so
35:28 - how else would you control volume just
35:30 - up and down
35:33 - i guess we could skip the volume for now
35:35 - and then if we needed it we could add in
35:37 - another library that has a slider
35:40 - on it
35:41 - that wouldn't be a big deal yeah it
35:43 - seems like it doesn't have it unless
35:44 - it's in one of these other
35:47 - um
35:49 - ones rating is stars right
35:52 - yeah
35:53 - it's kind of cool
35:55 - um
35:56 - time picker input group
35:58 - check box
36:04 - bar spinner
36:08 - yeah i don't see one here oh well
36:10 - oh is it called range
36:17 - oh range type input
36:21 - okay
36:23 - oh they do have one cool
36:30 - all right
36:31 - is this the only example they have
36:34 - oh with different step values
36:37 - okay
36:38 - yeah the basic one is is good
36:41 - so basically
36:43 - it's a b form input
36:45 - and then give it a type of range
36:47 - all right
36:55 - okay i'll just put it after
36:58 - the power and see how that looks
37:00 - so
37:03 - id range
37:07 - um i don't even think i'll need an id
37:08 - here
37:14 - um
37:15 - v model i'm gonna have to set up the v
37:17 - models
37:18 - min max
37:21 - that's fine okay
37:23 - so let me see
37:26 - all right
37:28 - that looks okay
37:30 - um
37:31 - i wonder now should i put
37:35 - the volume i guess i could put
37:38 - the volume
37:40 - yeah
37:41 - make it a lot smaller and put it next to
37:43 - sound because you really don't need the
37:45 - whole width
37:46 - for volume unless i put volume at the
37:48 - bottom
37:49 - and put power
37:51 - and the sound title here
37:53 - and then
37:54 - put volume below it
37:56 - um
37:58 - let's see
38:00 - also
38:01 - if i pass in
38:05 - if i pass something into the form input
38:08 - component
38:10 - um
38:11 - that probably won't be a label
38:13 - yeah because it's not like a checkbox
38:15 - so
38:17 - let me try to
38:22 - i'll make that self-closing
38:24 - and maybe i can pass in a label
38:27 - which is
38:29 - volume
38:31 - okay
38:36 - nope doesn't take label
38:38 - so
38:41 - it doesn't have a list of props here
38:47 - no range inputs
38:49 - return their value as a string you may
38:51 - need to convert the value yeah
38:55 - does not include styling for range
38:56 - inputs inside input groups however
38:59 - bootstrap u includes custom styling to
39:02 - handle these situations until styling is
39:04 - included in bootstrap
39:06 - okay so bootstrap 5 just came out so i'm
39:09 - guessing bootstrap 5 has styling for
39:10 - this
39:11 - i think maybe it's still in alpha i'm
39:13 - not sure
39:14 - anyway
39:15 - uh
39:17 - let me add the
39:18 - box here to show the name first and then
39:20 - i'll figure out what i'm gonna do
39:22 - with
39:24 - the volume where i'm gonna put it i
39:26 - guess
39:28 - i saw a library on github
39:31 - vue bootstrap slider
39:33 - yeah i thought some people called it
39:35 - slider i feel like i've used it as a
39:37 - slider before
39:41 - or maybe it's like the whole
39:43 - dialogue modal thing everyone's starting
39:45 - to call it a dialogue and we seem to be
39:48 - losing the name modal to standardize it
39:52 - um
39:53 - okay
39:55 - b
39:55 - form input
39:58 - uh
39:59 - and then i guess
40:01 - so i guess i'll be putting rows and
40:02 - columns inside of this card
40:05 - so
40:06 - if i do a b row
40:10 - here
40:12 - and close the b row
40:15 - and then
40:16 - let me put a check box
40:18 - or not a check box let me put the
40:22 - name box
40:24 - inside this row and then
40:27 - um
40:30 - let's see also this is this is quite
40:32 - zoomed in if i zoom out a little bit
40:34 - it's more accurate
40:36 - so let me put uh
40:39 - i don't know a div do they have
40:43 - paper i'm not sure if they have
40:46 - um
40:49 - paper so what do i do if i want this
40:53 - with
40:54 - like a just a regular box
40:58 - like an outline box without
41:01 - using another card element
41:05 - so in beautify they have something
41:07 - called paper
41:11 - and i'm not sure
41:13 - i guess i can just style it myself
41:17 - that might be the easiest thing to do
41:24 - okay i'm just gonna
41:26 - style it just make a box a regular div
41:31 - and i'm gonna call
41:32 - it class equals
41:35 - name box
41:38 - search for border
41:40 - so borders are the classes they have
41:42 - right for borders
41:46 - um
41:49 - sidebar styling borders
41:53 - border border
41:58 - yeah these are utility classes for
41:59 - borders
42:02 - so
42:05 - border right border danger
42:08 - those ones
42:10 - okay so i can still make my own div here
42:14 - and
42:16 - might not have to do a custom class
42:18 - because then i can just use their
42:20 - utility classes for spacing too
42:23 - um
42:25 - so what is this
42:26 - let me let me just put a placeholder
42:29 - here sound name
42:31 - and here
42:35 - let's see
42:37 - let me get out of components
42:43 - so where are their utility classes
42:46 - let me search
42:48 - bootstrap for utility classes
42:57 - okay so this
42:59 - shows these are utility classes from for
43:02 - spacing
43:04 - um
43:06 - inside the layout grid system okay
43:09 - so where would the
43:13 - maybe these utility classes
43:15 - yeah border utilities
43:18 - okay it takes me to the actual bootstrap
43:21 - so okay so i guess i just
43:24 - use the these classes from bootstrap
43:28 - um
43:30 - so i can do border
43:32 - and then i don't think i want border
43:34 - danger or anything
43:39 - okay cool it gave me a border
43:41 - and now i can add some margin or padding
43:44 - classes
43:46 - so let me do padding
43:49 - all
43:51 - now let me do padding
43:53 - let's see on the x axis
43:56 - of
43:58 - four
43:59 - boost strap
44:01 - has a funky way of calculating
44:04 - padding and margin
44:07 - that isn't just multiplying
44:09 - so i think four is something like 16
44:12 - pixels or close to it maybe
44:15 - and then this should be something around
44:17 - six or eight pixels
44:19 - okay i think that looks pretty good for
44:21 - a box
44:22 - but
44:24 - it's not at all aligned here
44:27 - so
44:29 - what i could do is add
44:32 - some
44:34 - i guess css or
44:37 - um
44:39 - what do i call that flexbox classes
44:44 - inside the row
44:47 - um
44:50 - so let me see let me add a class
44:53 - of
44:54 - and actually this row i don't know if
44:57 - the rows default to display flex already
45:01 - let me see
45:07 - let me look inside row
45:09 - yeah it's already defaulting
45:11 - to display flex
45:15 - yeah thanks
45:16 - so i don't need to put
45:18 - display flex in here so i can i think i
45:21 - can just use
45:22 - flex
45:23 - um
45:24 - elements now
45:26 - so i could do
45:28 - um
45:30 - what is it justify
45:34 - um
45:35 - justify content oh it's giving me all of
45:38 - them cool
45:39 - uh justify content space between is the
45:41 - one i want
45:42 - so let me start typing justify content
45:46 - space
45:47 - between
45:50 - and oh it gave me an underscore did he
45:52 - start with underscores
45:56 - why did i do that i don't know if i did
45:59 - that
46:02 - okay so it said the row already has
46:05 - display flex but maybe it doesn't let me
46:07 - try
46:08 - if that makes a difference
46:13 - no so
46:14 - uh let me get rid of that
46:19 - okay
46:21 - um so does anyone know
46:23 - why this isn't pushing let me look in
46:25 - the dev tools
46:28 - and see
46:31 - okay so
46:35 - in the div
46:38 - okay so here
46:41 - display flex flex wrap
46:46 - and
46:52 - it's not
46:53 - justified content so the class isn't
46:56 - correct
46:57 - then
47:00 - so let me go into the bootstrap
47:05 - flex classes
47:10 - oh i guess this would be in the
47:12 - utility classes as well
47:15 - so let me look in regular bootstrap for
47:18 - flex
47:19 - utilities
47:23 - um
47:25 - so where is it justify content
47:29 - there
47:31 - and justify content okay so it's just
47:34 - justify content between
47:40 - so
47:41 - oh i put space between
47:44 - okay
47:47 - sweet okay that works
47:50 - um
47:52 - all right that's pretty good
47:54 - now
47:57 - i do want to add some margin to the row
48:00 - just in general and also to the card
48:03 - because it's pushed up against
48:04 - everything else
48:05 - so i'm going to add some
48:07 - um
48:09 - oh wait i think i have to put it inside
48:11 - a class so margin all
48:15 - or margin top of
48:18 - four
48:19 - let's see
48:21 - okay that's good that pushes the top
48:22 - card down
48:24 - and
48:26 - um
48:28 - let's see i'd also want a margin i guess
48:31 - for each card i'll just add a margin top
48:33 - margin top
48:36 - class equals margin top of four
48:42 - okay that looks pretty good
48:44 - and i don't want
48:46 - these to be so close to the edges
48:49 - so let me add
48:51 - a margin
48:53 - let's see
48:55 - i guess to the row here
48:57 - so
48:58 - i can add a
49:00 - margin more uh
49:03 - margin on the
49:05 - x-axis
49:07 - of
49:10 - two
49:13 - okay that looks much better
49:17 - all right so i have the sound name i
49:19 - have the power bar and then i like
49:20 - volume being below that was too many
49:22 - things squished into one row but i need
49:25 - some kind of a title for it
49:28 - um let me put it in its own row first
49:32 - so it matches the rest of the content so
49:34 - b
49:35 - row
49:38 - b row
49:42 - okay
49:44 - and now
49:47 - i have the input
49:48 - so i guess i will want an id actually if
49:51 - i'm going to give it a label
49:53 - so the id will just be
49:56 - volume i guess
49:58 - oops
49:59 - volume
50:00 - and then
50:03 - label
50:04 - for
50:07 - volume
50:09 - okay
50:11 - and then
50:16 - um yeah just volume inside the label
50:23 - all right and then i wanted to give this
50:24 - the same kind of margin spacing that i
50:27 - gave to the top row
50:29 - so
50:30 - i'll add
50:32 - class
50:34 - equals
50:36 - m
50:36 - [Music]
50:38 - x of 2 and then i want some margin top
50:42 - between the top row as well
50:44 - so let me see how that looks
50:48 - actually i want more margin
50:51 - between the top row
50:54 - okay cool i think that looks pretty good
50:56 - what do you think
50:59 - and
51:00 - yeah
51:01 - and now i need the buttons
51:03 - in
51:04 - the bottom card
51:07 - so let me see
51:10 - b row b card
51:14 - okay so in this card i want to do
51:17 - did i get rid of my class here i thought
51:19 - i had a class of margin i guess i got
51:22 - rid of it at some point
51:23 - margin top of four
51:26 - and now i want to have
51:30 - basically square boxes
51:33 - that
51:34 - are displayed
51:36 - i'm going to be looping through them too
51:38 - so i'm going to want some kind of flex
51:40 - wrap so that i can loop through them all
51:44 - so let's see
51:48 - yeah
51:49 - thanks
51:50 - um
51:52 - so it's basically like the first hour
51:54 - trying to get
51:55 - the styling set up in the second hour
51:58 - actually doing the vjs work
52:01 - um okay so let me just i guess just
52:05 - create squares
52:07 - right there's no like
52:08 - actual square class
52:11 - somewhere
52:12 - um
52:13 - eventually it would be cool to have one
52:15 - icon
52:16 - in each button
52:19 - but
52:21 - uh
52:23 - should they be buttons
52:25 - i guess they should be buttons even
52:27 - though they're square not rectangle i
52:29 - think it would make sense so i'm
52:30 - guessing it's b
52:34 - btn maybe
52:37 - let's see
52:39 - where are the buttons
52:44 - it's been a while since i used bootstrap
52:48 - i think it has i don't remember the last
52:50 - time i did
52:51 - oh by the way one thing i found the
52:53 - other day
52:54 - someone sent me i think
52:56 - is
52:59 - boot swatch
53:02 - it was
53:03 - they have all these free themes for
53:06 - bootstrap
53:07 - and there are also components and other
53:09 - things
53:10 - which i thought was pretty cool
53:13 - that you can just use any of these
53:14 - things to make bootstrap look a lot
53:16 - nicer
53:19 - uh yeah maybe if i
53:20 - make this drum app look nice i might use
53:22 - one
53:23 - alright
53:24 - so here's a button okay so it's spelled
53:26 - out
53:27 - b
53:28 - button
53:30 - and then i can give it a variant
53:33 - if i want i'll probably have outlined
53:35 - buttons maybe
53:37 - um
53:38 - so it's
53:40 - b button and then
53:44 - um let me just close it for now and then
53:46 - i'll put
53:50 - sound or
53:51 - x or
53:53 - i don't know
53:55 - let's see
53:57 - let's see how that looks okay
54:01 - okay that's actually square
54:03 - so we're kind of square anyway
54:05 - now
54:06 - let me make that
54:08 - bigger maybe if i just add enough
54:11 - padding
54:12 - that will come out to be a big square
54:14 - button
54:16 - so class equals
54:21 - although if i had a div i would just set
54:23 - the size of it
54:25 - instead of
54:27 - the padding
54:29 - so padding all
54:31 - four
54:36 - um does it like that
54:40 - did i
54:41 - yeah i gave it the correct padding you
54:43 - know what i don't think button is the is
54:45 - the right thing for this
54:47 - i think i'm going to use a div
54:50 - div
54:52 - and then
54:54 - i'll just put an x inside
54:57 - because that way it's not dependent on
54:59 - what's inside of it for spacing
55:02 - versus just padding a button
55:05 - so let me do
55:07 - class equals
55:09 - padding oh i guess i'm padding this too
55:12 - i'm going to just set the side is the
55:14 - size of these
55:15 - so let's do class
55:18 - um sound
55:24 - sound button
55:26 - i don't know
55:28 - okay so sound button and now in my style
55:32 - tag
55:33 - i can style
55:36 - sound
55:37 - button
55:40 - and
55:43 - padding all
55:44 - okay bootstrap does p4
55:47 - all right thanks
55:49 - um
55:51 - so i'm gonna do width
55:54 - of
55:55 - 50 pixels
55:57 - height is 50 pixels
56:00 - because i want to set absolute heights
56:02 - and widths on these
56:05 - okay so i can tell it got bigger
56:10 - just by
56:13 - why isn't it
56:15 - yeah
56:16 - that's 50 by 50. so this is actually
56:18 - going to have to be like 200 by 200.
56:21 - um
56:25 - 50 is not very big
56:27 - 200 pixels
56:28 - oh did i get rid of pixels
56:30 - okay
56:31 - so 200 by 200
56:35 - and then i'm gonna need to
56:38 - make the parent here
56:42 - so
56:44 - um this should already be
56:47 - oh no this is inside a card so what i'm
56:50 - going to do now is do a b row because i
56:52 - want to wrap
56:54 - all the buttons so i can loop through
56:55 - them
56:56 - and then i think b row has
57:00 - not just flex display flex set but i
57:02 - think it has
57:04 - um
57:05 - flex that row wrap so it'll just wrap
57:08 - the containers around
57:12 - all right
57:14 - so
57:18 - inside of the row
57:22 - and now i'll do
57:26 - i'm still gonna want
57:28 - i guess justify
57:30 - content center
57:37 - okay
57:38 - and then
57:42 - let me start looping through something
57:44 - here to display these buttons
57:47 - so let me import clips
57:49 - into this file
57:51 - so let me import because i'm exporting
57:55 - this array of objects from clips
57:58 - so
57:59 - it's not json or anything so i can just
58:01 - import
58:04 - that array so clips from
58:08 - clips
58:12 - and then
58:14 - let's see
58:18 - clips let me put it on data here so
58:25 - let's
58:25 - make a data function
58:28 - turn
58:29 - the object
58:31 - and
58:33 - do the clips array
58:35 - so now there should be nine clips in
58:37 - that file if i counted correctly
58:40 - so now i can
58:42 - inside this sound button
58:45 - i can let me put it on a few rows
58:52 - i can do v4
58:54 - equals
58:58 - clip
58:59 - in clips
59:02 - and then
59:03 - the key i'm just going to use
59:06 - clip dot name
59:10 - which all of them are unique so because
59:12 - i already know that
59:16 - cool so it's a little bit off but
59:21 - it's displaying nine of them let me make
59:23 - these
59:25 - uh a little bit smaller
59:28 - so
59:29 - let me try
59:33 - 160
59:37 - 160.
59:41 - okay i think that's okay if i center
59:44 - them and spread them out a little bit
59:47 - and now let me add a border so i can
59:49 - actually see where they are
59:51 - so
59:52 - class i'm going to add a border here
59:58 - cool i think that's actually pretty good
60:00 - uh i don't like that i can't scroll down
60:02 - past this let me just
60:06 - uh instead of margin
60:08 - uh just top i'm gonna replace that
60:12 - with the y-axis so now i can scroll down
60:15 - a little bit past
60:16 - the bottom
60:20 - okay
60:22 - so
60:23 - um
60:25 - let's see what do i want to do these
60:27 - should be a little bit spaced and the x
60:29 - needs to be centered vertically and
60:31 - horizontally
60:32 - which i can do with flexbox
60:36 - and let me space these out just a little
60:38 - bit
60:39 - so
60:39 - on the cards
60:41 - i can do
60:44 - margin
60:45 - of
60:47 - 1.
60:48 - okay
60:50 - all right that looks good
60:52 - and now
60:55 - for the border actually let me do border
60:59 - of
61:01 - oh can i do any color
61:04 - fuchsia
61:06 - does that work no i think it has to be
61:09 - one of those
61:10 - standard colors like
61:12 - warning or something
61:16 - yeah now the border changed
61:19 - okay i'm gonna leave it like that
61:22 - um
61:24 - i think it looks
61:26 - pretty good
61:28 - um oh yeah one more thing is that the
61:30 - border
61:32 - uh that these cards have a border radius
61:35 - but
61:36 - the
61:37 - things that i built do not
61:40 - so let me see
61:41 - what the border radius on these are
61:45 - border
61:49 - um hmm
61:53 - am i on the right one
61:59 - let's see
62:03 - computed
62:07 - yeah it should be here
62:12 - border left border
62:16 - yeah here it is four pixels okay so
62:19 - border top left radius 4 pixels so they
62:22 - just set them individually
62:24 - okay
62:25 - so i want these cards to have
62:28 - 4 pixel radius because it seems like
62:29 - everything else does
62:32 - and i'll put it here too so i think they
62:34 - have a utility class for
62:37 - um
62:38 - border radiuses
62:42 - let's see
62:44 - here we go
62:48 - um
62:52 - rounded okay
62:57 - add border classes
63:00 - so i guess rounded
63:05 - would be
63:11 - i don't i feel like these sizes should
63:12 - be standard and they don't say what the
63:14 - sizes are anywhere
63:16 - let me see what this actually means
63:21 - so
63:24 - if i look
63:27 - at
63:29 - oh that's an svg will that show me
63:32 - oh that's 3.2 pixels
63:34 - and what's this one
63:40 - okay so
63:42 - oh well i mean it's close enough i'll
63:44 - get a little bit of a round so let me do
63:46 - rounded large
63:50 - um
63:51 - okay that's fine
63:53 - rounded large
63:55 - it's close enough to four for me anyway
63:59 - and let me put that class here too oh
64:01 - let me put it next to the other border
64:04 - class
64:08 - all right
64:09 - okay i think that looks good
64:13 - it seems to match up enough anyway
64:16 - um
64:17 - okay so now i have all the buttons let
64:19 - me just do one more styling thing which
64:21 - is move this x
64:23 - to center it here
64:26 - and
64:27 - how do i do that
64:29 - let's see
64:30 - um
64:32 - i already have so many classes here
64:34 - it's just
64:35 - so many classes
64:38 - so i'm just gonna put them inside of
64:41 - here then
64:43 - uh let me put
64:44 - um
64:46 - so
64:47 - display flex oh wait i can't do that
64:49 - down here
64:50 - display
64:52 - flex
64:54 - uh
64:56 - align
64:58 - let me do justify first so justify
65:01 - con
65:02 - content
65:04 - center
65:06 - align
65:08 - can i do a line item center
65:11 - let's see
65:13 - okay cool
65:14 - awesome and now i have
65:16 - everything centered so even if i type
65:18 - text in there
65:20 - like instead of the x i could do
65:23 - um
65:25 - let's say clip oh wait let me put this
65:27 - in the double curly braces so clip dot
65:30 - name
65:31 - i could put the name of the clip in
65:32 - there
65:35 - oh cool i think that's actually better
65:37 - for right now because there's no icon
65:39 - associated with the clip so to have the
65:41 - name of it
65:43 - um
65:44 - you can tell these aren't
65:45 - drums or anything
65:48 - um
65:49 - although i do have a drum set at my
65:50 - house i was thinking about recording
65:52 - myself
65:53 - do it but i'd have to move my whole
65:54 - audio setup into another room to record
65:57 - each sound and i just said okay well i'm
66:00 - just going to use these free mp3 files
66:03 - oh one more thing one more thing i do
66:05 - want to style
66:08 - um
66:09 - so
66:10 - on hover
66:12 - oops hover
66:13 - i do want to style
66:16 - let's see
66:19 - um
66:20 - was it oh the mouse pointer so
66:24 - uh cursor is it pointer cursor cursor
66:27 - pointer i think it's cursor
66:29 - pointer
66:33 - yeah and now i have
66:35 - it looks like it's clickable
66:39 - cool
66:42 - so
66:44 - it's not perfect styling but it's okay i
66:46 - think
66:48 - okay thanks
66:50 - yeah i can't i can't remember i've
66:53 - uh
66:55 - css is is just
66:57 - a memorization language kind of so it's
67:00 - like
67:00 - if you're not in it every day
67:02 - it's like you forget
67:04 - the exact terms you have to use i guess
67:08 - so
67:09 - what do i want to do next so i have
67:14 - i have all the clips
67:16 - um
67:17 - let's try to play sounds
67:19 - right so let's
67:21 - let's make a function
67:23 - a method here
67:25 - so
67:26 - methods
67:28 - oh no i hope you can hear the sounds
67:32 - uh
67:35 - oh wait i think i have system audio
67:37 - muted
67:38 - but maybe i can
67:43 - uh make it so you can hear well let me
67:45 - get the sounds playing first and see if
67:47 - you can hear them
67:48 - so let's see
67:50 - a play clip
67:53 - so this function
67:55 - it's gonna have to take in the name of
67:57 - the sound
67:58 - that url so
68:01 - i'm gonna have to pass in the exact clip
68:06 - and then this is where
68:08 - i'm planning on using the what is it
68:11 - javascript
68:12 - the audio constructor so
68:16 - audio
68:17 - not the html5 audio tag but the
68:20 - uh well this this should come up
68:23 - somewhere
68:30 - new audio yeah
68:32 - this is it
68:36 - um
68:37 - not a lot of details here
68:39 - all right
68:40 - yeah so basically
68:42 - i can create new audio element and play
68:44 - sounds in the browser
68:46 - um
68:51 - that's yeah that's as much as i can say
68:53 - about that
68:54 - i thought it would show like
68:56 - oh yeah here so once you create that
68:59 - audio element you can do dot play
69:02 - and
69:03 - yeah there are other things called like
69:06 - pause
69:07 - dot pause
69:09 - i should really contribute to that
69:11 - documentation
69:13 - um with some examples all right
69:16 - so that's
69:17 - that's what i'm gonna be using and i
69:20 - think
69:21 - that i can pass these in dynamically
69:24 - which i hope is going to work
69:26 - so let's do
69:28 - let's
69:32 - let s equal
69:35 - new
69:36 - audio
69:37 - so use the javascript constructor
69:40 - and then i'll pass in the clip
69:42 - which actually let me call it clip url
69:45 - so there's no confusion about what i'm
69:47 - passing in
69:48 - not the whole object just passing in the
69:50 - url
69:52 - and then
69:53 - s is now this audio object
69:56 - so now i should be able to do s dot play
70:01 - all right
70:02 - so no pause feature or anything yet
70:05 - um but that's okay
70:09 - so
70:10 - i guess to do pause i'd have to put it
70:12 - on data and do some other things i don't
70:14 - know
70:15 - to capture which clip is playing so i
70:17 - could pause it
70:20 - so
70:22 - okay so now when i click on this button
70:25 - i need to have some kind of
70:28 - i guess i'll just put in
70:30 - an act click to capture the click event
70:32 - directly on that div
70:34 - for my square buttons
70:36 - so
70:38 - um
70:38 - at click
70:41 - [Music]
70:42 - is oh yeah the method i just made play
70:46 - clip
70:47 - and then pass in the clip url
70:50 - so
70:52 - let's see pass in
70:55 - the clip dot what did i call that
70:58 - an eclipse
71:00 - oh i called it clip so it's clip.clip
71:03 - i'm gonna change this real quick sorry
71:04 - one second so clip
71:07 - replace it with
71:08 - url
71:10 - okay that is much better
71:14 - now it's just url
71:17 - okay so now i can do clip dot
71:19 - url
71:21 - pass that into play clip
71:23 - and i'm gonna make sure
71:26 - my volume is on yeah
71:29 - yes can you hear that
71:34 - it says that system audio is playing
71:36 - through my stream so
71:50 - i do like the puppy sounds though
71:55 - okay
71:56 - thanks thanks for confirming that
71:59 - um
72:01 - all right so this plays the clip
72:03 - that feels good oh yeah the sound name i
72:05 - need to be capturing which sound is
72:07 - playing
72:08 - so i can update the sound name
72:11 - cool
72:12 - hi bruce how are you
72:16 - um
72:17 - let's see
72:19 - i guess yeah i'll just have
72:22 - like current
72:24 - sound
72:25 - current clip
72:27 - since i'm using the clip terminology
72:29 - uh
72:31 - so let's say
72:34 - empty string at first
72:38 - um and then
72:44 - our latest clip because it's not current
72:47 - clip if it doesn't change after the clip
72:49 - ends
72:51 - so
72:54 - our last played
72:57 - last played i don't know
73:00 - that's fine
73:01 - [Music]
73:02 - um so let me
73:05 - do
73:06 - so i'll do this dot last
73:10 - played
73:12 - equals
73:15 - okay and then in this case i can't just
73:17 - pass in the clip url i'm going to have
73:19 - to pass in
73:21 - the whole clip
73:24 - so i'll have to pass in the name and the
73:26 - url
73:28 - and then here i'll update this to url
73:32 - and then last played will
73:35 - be set to the name
73:39 - okay
73:40 - so now i have to update that here
73:43 - so
73:44 - oops um
73:47 - oh wait wait
73:49 - uh
73:50 - here i'll just pass in the whole clip
73:52 - and then i'm pulling url and name off of
73:54 - that
73:56 - and
73:57 - what's the other thing oh yeah the sound
73:59 - name so
74:01 - i'm gonna have to put
74:03 - last played here
74:08 - oh
74:10 - that kind of stinks because when it's
74:13 - empty it turns into the shriveled thing
74:16 - i'm gonna have to put a default sound
74:20 - [Music]
74:24 - okay yeah i'm gonna have to put some
74:27 - a default there
74:32 - no sound or something
74:34 - so it doesn't
74:37 - just fold
74:38 - um with no text inside
74:44 - okay cool
74:45 - all right so let me hook up the power
74:47 - switch then
74:49 - and see
74:50 - so what should i do for the power switch
74:53 - um
74:54 - i guess i the easiest thing to do would
74:56 - be to put something on data
74:59 - like a boolean on or off and then
75:02 - have an if statement inside play clip
75:05 - um but what i should actually do
75:08 - is make these disabled so you can't
75:10 - click on them
75:12 - or
75:13 - show that they're disabled like gray
75:15 - them out somehow
75:17 - so i could do
75:19 - a class
75:21 - okay let me
75:22 - first let me v model
75:24 - the check box
75:26 - here
75:27 - so
75:28 - put this on two lines
75:30 - so the pat that power switch let me
75:33 - remodel that so i can capture the value
75:37 - equals
75:39 - um
75:40 - power
75:42 - should i do is
75:45 - power no
75:47 - because power can mean different things
75:48 - so
75:50 - is on
75:52 - oh no in javascript i should do
75:56 - a camel case so is on
76:00 - so
76:03 - in data now i'll do is on
76:08 - oh let me start off with true and then
76:09 - you can turn it off if you want
76:13 - okay cool
76:15 - so it's definitely mapping now
76:18 - because it starts off as true
76:21 - and then it goes off all right
76:24 - so now i have to disable these buttons
76:28 - which i'm going to do through an if
76:30 - statement
76:32 - unless someone else has a better idea so
76:35 - and then i can add a class to the
76:37 - buttons to kind of show the user that
76:38 - they're disabled since they're not
76:40 - actual buttons they're divs so
76:42 - i'll just
76:44 - change the class or something
76:48 - oh yeah instead of sound button
76:50 - maybe i'll have disabled button or
76:52 - something i don't know
76:54 - okay so if
76:56 - um
76:58 - this dot is on
77:02 - then
77:04 - i can do all that stuff
77:12 - all right
77:16 - but now it's off it doesn't do anything
77:18 - sweet
77:19 - um but now i don't want these
77:23 - classes
77:24 - so i want to gray them out somehow
77:27 - so i don't know should what should i do
77:29 - an overlay
77:32 - um
77:34 - or something
77:37 - let me make a new class here so let's
77:39 - call this
77:42 - um button disabled
77:49 - and say
77:52 - uh
77:55 - now let's change the border color i
77:57 - guess border now will be gray
78:03 - so
78:06 - okay so now if it's off
78:09 - oh i'm not actually applying the clasp
78:11 - oh man okay so button disabled now i
78:14 - have to
78:15 - conditionally toggle the class
78:18 - so
78:20 - let's see
78:24 - um how do i want to do this
78:30 - so because there's a bunch of classes
78:31 - here so let me see
78:33 - so i can do object syntax or array
78:35 - syntax
78:38 - and if i want to
78:45 - toggle
78:48 - um
78:54 - so i think let me look this up so vue.js
78:58 - dynamic
78:59 - classes
79:08 - and
79:15 - yeah i think if i do object syntax i can
79:18 - put the rest of the classes after the
79:20 - object right and then i don't have to
79:24 - um
79:26 - put them all inside the object so i
79:28 - could just have
79:31 - no i don't think i can do that so i
79:33 - think maybe i need an array here then
79:37 - so maybe i need an object inside of an
79:39 - array
79:41 - uh
79:42 - let's see
79:43 - and then this would be
79:46 - inside of a string
79:49 - and then inside the object it would be
79:52 - um
79:54 - so i'd be checking is
79:57 - is on
79:59 - and then if it is on then i want my
80:02 - class button disabled
80:06 - so
80:06 - i'm going to have to put that in quotes
80:08 - so
80:09 - button
80:10 - disabled
80:15 - so it doesn't like this so i think i
80:17 - need a comma here maybe
80:19 - oh yeah it seems to do okay with that
80:23 - that's good
80:25 - so
80:26 - if is on oh if not is ons meaning if
80:29 - it's not on
80:32 - then the button is disabled okay
80:34 - let me try that
80:38 - doesn't like it
80:41 - okay let me
80:44 - see what's going on with the buttons so
80:47 - okay
80:49 - now
80:52 - okay so it is adding the clasp properly
80:54 - because it's
80:55 - it's changing and now it's adding button
80:57 - disabled to all the buttons
80:59 - but my problem is now in my
81:06 - um
81:08 - css
81:09 - so do i do border color
81:12 - but border
81:17 - let's see
81:19 - now i think because it's putting that
81:21 - class first
81:23 - um
81:24 - that's why
81:28 - so i would have to put this class at the
81:30 - end basically
81:34 - let me
81:35 - do this on two lines
81:37 - um
81:38 - so i would have to put this class at the
81:40 - end so actually i'm gonna
81:43 - get this out
81:46 - and
81:46 - [Music]
81:47 - paste it after
81:50 - oh yeah and then
81:52 - put that back
81:54 - okay
81:55 - so
81:56 - now
81:57 - it should work
82:01 - no it doesn't work
82:03 - it doesn't like that
82:06 - um
82:07 - let's see why isn't changing the border
82:09 - color though
82:12 - so i have button disabled here
82:16 - and
82:18 - it's called button disabled here that's
82:20 - good
82:21 - it might still be putting the class at
82:23 - the beginning
82:27 - okay
82:28 - so
82:30 - border bottom color border left color
82:33 - i mean for this
82:35 - small app i could just do an important
82:37 - statement because it's not overwriting
82:39 - it
82:40 - so i'm wondering if that's what
82:42 - bootstrap has let me look at the rules
82:47 - yeah that's what they're doing they're
82:49 - doing border color importance so to
82:51 - overwrite they're important i'm going to
82:52 - have to use another important statement
82:54 - because
82:55 - that's how important to work
82:57 - everything is more important
82:59 - all right so that's fine whatever
83:04 - it's not
83:07 - okay
83:08 - that's good and now if it's on
83:12 - it goes orange and if it's off it goes
83:18 - yeah that's what i have right now
83:21 - um i don't know maybe you said that a
83:23 - long time ago though about the sound
83:26 - button i don't know how how long the leg
83:28 - is right now
83:29 - hopefully it's not too long but
83:31 - sometimes on youtube it can get a bit
83:33 - long
83:37 - yeah this is the same thing i had maybe
83:39 - it wasn't when you said that comment
83:40 - though
83:43 - oh i guess it's not because it's not is
83:45 - on but yeah the important did it because
83:48 - bootstrap is using important statements
83:51 - but i want to look at i want to make it
83:53 - look like more disabled than it is
83:56 - you know because this looks like it
83:57 - still could be a button oh also the
84:00 - pointer
84:02 - the pointer needs to go away
84:04 - i should do an either or class really
84:07 - um except i want some of these things
84:10 - like
84:12 - actually i want all of these things
84:14 - except the hover
84:16 - so
84:19 - um oh you know what i could do though
84:24 - is
84:26 - border warning
84:28 - what if i put this inside here too
84:31 - so
84:33 - that way i don't need the border gray
84:35 - right
84:38 - let me see let me take out the border
84:40 - gray
84:42 - and see
84:44 - because that way
84:45 - if it's not on
84:49 - oh now it's opposite
84:52 - oh
84:53 - right
84:54 - um
84:55 - okay
84:56 - well never mind because
84:59 - i forgot i'm doing it if it's not on
85:02 - display these classes
85:05 - okay so that was a bad idea
85:07 - let me go back
85:10 - i could do another
85:13 - um
85:16 - so i could
85:19 - i guess i could do a ternary here
85:22 - like is on
85:24 - and i don't know would that be
85:26 - inside a nested
85:29 - like look let me see if i can do a
85:31 - ternary here
85:34 - um
85:36 - and do
85:40 - so here i would have to do
85:43 - i would have to do is on
85:48 - yeah i could do two objects
85:51 - um that would definitely work
85:54 - i'm going to try to do
85:57 - [Music]
85:59 - this so let me get rid of that
86:02 - and then
86:04 - i can do
86:07 - so if it's on
86:09 - oh no no i don't want the button to be
86:11 - disabled
86:12 - let's see i want
86:15 - border
86:17 - warning
86:19 - oh wait and then if it's not on i want
86:22 - the other one i think this is going to
86:23 - work
86:25 - and that way i don't have to do two
86:26 - objects inside i can just check is on
86:28 - once
86:31 - it's not giving me an error so
86:34 - um i think it will work
86:40 - yeah that works
86:41 - cool
86:43 - awesome
86:45 - so
86:49 - let me now change
86:55 - um i don't know should i add an overlay
86:59 - i could add a background
87:01 - just to make it look more disabled like
87:03 - background color
87:05 - of
87:06 - light gray
87:12 - and let me turn it off
87:16 - uh
87:17 - i don't know
87:18 - and then get rid of the
87:22 - um
87:24 - mouse actually you know there's one
87:26 - pointer there's one mouse pointer that
87:28 - has like
87:30 - an x let me look that up because
87:33 - cursor
87:36 - mouse
87:38 - pointers css
87:48 - help wait cross hair cursor cross hair
87:51 - or cursor not allowed
87:54 - um let me see
87:56 - let me see which one
88:00 - which one would look better so now let
88:01 - me go to hover
88:03 - so
88:04 - and
88:06 - hover
88:09 - and then cursor
88:12 - um
88:14 - which which one should i try across here
88:16 - across here
88:21 - oh no that's not what i want i thought
88:24 - this was something different that's not
88:26 - at all
88:27 - that looks like i can
88:29 - drag and select
88:31 - what about not allowed yeah not allowed
88:33 - this one i don't know if you can see it
88:35 - it has the
88:38 - little circle with the line through it
88:40 - in it
88:41 - okay so i'm gonna do not allowed
88:46 - not
88:48 - allowed
88:50 - okay
88:52 - cool now it really looks disabled like
88:55 - you can't do anything
88:56 - and now if i put the power back on
88:58 - you can click on
89:02 - okay uh that all works now
89:05 - so what should i do i guess i should do
89:07 - volume
89:08 - i actually have no idea how to do this i
89:10 - don't think i've ever
89:12 - done volume in the browser
89:15 - let's see
89:18 - um
89:19 - so javascript
89:21 - audio
89:25 - what the audio constructor
89:29 - volume
89:36 - hmm
89:40 - audio context
89:44 - i wonder if it's audio context
89:52 - okay this probably doesn't say anything
89:54 - yeah
89:56 - so that doesn't say anything
90:00 - let me look in audio context real quick
90:04 - interface represents an audio processing
90:06 - graph built from audio
90:09 - uh no i don't think that's what i want
90:14 - create gain create
90:18 - is that what i want
90:21 - uh i really have no idea
90:25 - i could just look straight up like
90:27 - how to
90:30 - set volume in javascript
90:34 - let's see if this is what they're doing
90:38 - okay this person
90:40 - is trying to play and mix multiple
90:42 - sounds play the same sounds interrupt
90:44 - playback
90:48 - let me see if they have volume
90:53 - okay
90:55 - so
90:56 - this was in 2012. the web audio api is
91:00 - now supported
91:04 - although there are a lot of issues no
91:05 - common volume controls let me see the
91:08 - link
91:09 - that it provides
91:11 - oh it goes to the github page
91:15 - okay
91:18 - web audio api editors draft so this is
91:21 - the absolute latest from 2020.
91:24 - um
91:34 - an audio param interface for controlling
91:36 - an individual aspect of an audio node's
91:38 - functioning such as volume
91:41 - i said document dot my
91:45 - audio
91:47 - oh i can change it audio.volume
91:50 - so
91:52 - i could do it here then right so
91:55 - let's see
91:58 - i could do s dot
92:00 - volume
92:02 - equals
92:07 - um
92:08 - 2
92:09 - or 0.2
92:12 - 0.2
92:18 - and close this then
92:19 - all right
92:24 - yeah that does work
92:28 - cool thanks
92:30 - um
92:31 - yeah so i guess
92:34 - yeah let me do it
92:36 - uh to equal this dot range
92:39 - and then i'm gonna have to give it a
92:40 - default here
92:42 - so
92:45 - um
92:46 - let's say
92:47 - actually
92:49 - min max
92:50 - so range has a min max where is range
92:53 - here it is
92:55 - so min 0 max 5
92:58 - and
92:59 - v model of value let me change the value
93:02 - to range
93:04 - or no no let me change it to volume
93:07 - okay
93:08 - so
93:09 - volume
93:12 - and then
93:14 - i'll put it here so this will be
93:18 - volume
93:19 - and let me start it off at two so in the
93:22 - middle
93:25 - and
93:26 - then here it will be
93:28 - volume
93:29 - cool thank you thanks for that
93:38 - nope
93:39 - oh wait i think
93:42 - this
93:43 - does this have to be a zero to one
93:45 - number
93:47 - i think it might have to be let me look
93:49 - at whatever you w3 schools
93:53 - yeah that's what i thought thanks
93:56 - zero to one
93:58 - okay so the leg can't be too bad because
94:01 - that seemed to your comment seemed to
94:02 - come up pretty quick
94:05 - dom audio volume property
94:09 - yeah so this is the same thing dot
94:11 - volume all right
94:14 - let's see
94:16 - so i guess i'll divide it by
94:21 - if it's zero to five man
94:23 - um
94:26 - i can't even think right now so let me
94:28 - divide it by
94:34 - five
94:36 - oh wait
94:37 - right
94:40 - list of volume divided by five and it
94:42 - should be zero to one
94:45 - so
94:49 - by 10
94:58 - oh cool
95:01 - that works that works really well thanks
95:04 - i divided it by five because my max here
95:09 - is five
95:11 - so it's one to five zero is off anyway
95:14 - because you're going to have
95:16 - 0 divided by 5 so it's 0
95:19 - so it won't play any sound
95:23 - okay
95:27 - cool i didn't even know how to do volume
95:28 - before today
95:30 - so that's off this on
95:35 - yeah it's not a huge difference but
95:37 - there's a difference
95:38 - thank you
95:40 - thanks for all your help
95:41 - so is there anything else i should do
95:43 - let's see
95:44 - it's been an hour and 37 minutes
95:47 - so it's like 20 more minutes left
95:50 - um
95:52 - what else could you do with a
95:55 - drum machine i guess get actual drum
95:57 - sounds
95:58 - but
95:59 - this was one thing
96:01 - that i didn't
96:03 - realize because i guess
96:06 - i thought i'd have to use the audio tag
96:08 - but it's cool that i can just pass in
96:11 - a url dynamically to the audio
96:14 - constructor and it just plays
96:16 - that's pretty cool i think this is a
96:18 - nice api
96:20 - um
96:21 - oh what if what if we try to set up the
96:23 - pause i think that's going to be a lot
96:25 - harder
96:26 - so
96:29 - pause i think this should actually be
96:30 - stop
96:33 - stop
96:34 - right not pause because i'm not really
96:36 - pausing i'm stopping
96:39 - so
96:42 - um
96:47 - let's see
96:50 - so i'd need
96:52 - i would need this
96:54 - um instance of audio
96:57 - i think i need this stored on data so
96:59 - that i can run stop on it basically
97:01 - because then i could do this dot
97:06 - current
97:08 - clip
97:10 - no no no
97:12 - um
97:14 - like this dot
97:18 - audio
97:20 - current audi current audio maybe
97:24 - because that's the audio object
97:28 - and then i could do dot stop
97:32 - run dot stop or is it dot pause
97:36 - is it there should be a dot stop right
97:38 - but the only one i know for sure is dot
97:40 - pause
97:42 - so let's let me see if this works so i
97:45 - would do
97:46 - current audio
97:52 - which at first would just be an empty
97:54 - object
97:57 - and
98:00 - um
98:02 - what else
98:04 - so
98:05 - oh yeah so i need to actually
98:07 - do that here so then this would be
98:12 - uh this dot
98:13 - current audio
98:16 - and then i would do
98:21 - yeah basically here
98:24 - oh no i would set this after so
98:27 - let me
98:29 - do
98:31 - uh i don't like using s then
98:33 - i guess i could change it to a
98:36 - and then
98:37 - this dot current
98:40 - audio equals
98:42 - a
98:44 - and then i could stop it here
98:47 - basically
98:48 - oh but if i'm just pausing it's going to
98:50 - pause in the middle of the clip then i
98:52 - need to reset it
98:55 - right
98:56 - reset it back to the beginning of the
98:58 - clip
98:59 - let me just see let me see how this
99:01 - works
99:02 - a is not defined
99:04 - um oh oh right so
99:09 - actually i'm not redefining it here so
99:11 - let me do const
99:14 - okay
99:17 - oh yeah i need a stop button how do i
99:19 - stop
99:20 - um
99:22 - should i just do a pause button in the
99:23 - middle here
99:27 - uh
99:28 - i could change it into a pause button
99:31 - until it's done playing and then change
99:33 - it back into the name
99:35 - i think that would be pretty cool
99:37 - let me add a pause button here just so i
99:39 - can test this out real quick
99:40 - up at the top
99:42 - so in between power and last play let me
99:45 - add
99:48 - b
99:50 - button
99:53 - and
99:58 - i guess the variant
100:01 - is it called variant could be
100:06 - i don't know info
100:08 - so it's
100:10 - a different color
100:11 - and then
100:14 - uh what do i want to say oh yeah pause
100:18 - or stop
100:20 - stop
100:23 - okay stop cool and now i can add an ad
100:26 - click to this so
100:28 - at click
100:30 - click equals
100:34 - um
100:36 - oh yeah stop it's just stop
100:38 - that's my method name
100:41 - so let me try this
100:44 - oh it's not fast enough because all
100:46 - these clips are like
100:48 - one second long
100:50 - it's i think it
100:52 - i think it did stop
100:55 - yeah it did okay
100:57 - so stop works
101:00 - and i it didn't sound like i had to
101:02 - reset it do i have to reset it back to
101:04 - zero
101:08 - let me try to stop the van door
101:11 - yeah it does stop
101:14 - and then it does start over again so i
101:16 - guess pause just started the clip over
101:19 - i don't know if that's the intended
101:21 - behavior but that's what it seems to be
101:23 - doing
101:25 - okay
101:26 - so that seems to work
101:30 - um
101:33 - now my cat's meowing for attention
101:36 - um
101:38 - let me actually because everything else
101:40 - is outlined let me outline that button
101:42 - it looks like a eyesore
101:44 - in the middle of everything
101:46 - or
101:48 - i wonder if i should just put
101:52 - stop no because then i would have to
101:54 - know
101:55 - i would have to time when the clip
101:57 - stopped and then change it back to the
101:59 - name i don't have time for all that
102:01 - because i don't think i have time to
102:03 - figure out how to do that but that would
102:04 - be an interesting thing if i could do
102:06 - that let me just fix the button for
102:08 - right now
102:09 - let me
102:12 - fix oh i can just do outline dash
102:15 - so let me do outline dash then
102:17 - info
102:19 - so
102:20 - outline dash info
102:25 - okay
102:26 - that looks a bit better yeah and this
102:28 - looks clickable this looks like it's not
102:30 - clickable so that's good
102:34 - there should be a resume if you want to
102:36 - resume
102:40 - but i'm not sure if it's saving
102:43 - the current
102:45 - like is it saving the current state so
102:47 - when i stop
102:49 - is it saving that
102:54 - because i guess play starts over at zero
103:00 - thanks
103:01 - way funnier i could actually make music
103:04 - like this
103:05 - [Applause]
103:06 - [Music]
103:07 - [Applause]
103:10 - there should be a repeat like i should
103:12 - be able to toggle these on repeat
103:14 - so you can actually make a song
103:17 - um
103:19 - i wonder how to do that
103:23 - so
103:26 - let's see
103:28 - also right now stop
103:31 - if i'm doing multiple things it just
103:33 - stops the last one not like every single
103:36 - sound
103:38 - what do you mean no
103:42 - no you don't like the random sounds or
103:44 - no it's not
103:45 - music or i don't know what no means
103:49 - or you don't want repeat
103:55 - i guess that's not really a
103:57 - drum machine or yeah drum machine you
104:00 - would have repeat
104:01 - oh don't mix these sounds
104:03 - oh don't
104:04 - don't mix them because if i have repeat
104:07 - then
104:09 - i'll have the horse sound over and over
104:11 - again with poker chips and everything
104:13 - yeah they're not the best sounds to put
104:15 - together
104:17 - um
104:18 - okay
104:25 - well
104:28 - so some ideas were that i could
104:31 - do
104:32 - resume on the sound
104:34 - um
104:35 - but the sound starts over so
104:38 - i i guess also i'm when i play it again
104:41 - i'm setting this to a new
104:43 - current audio
104:46 - so
104:48 - yeah i wonder if if there's a way to
104:51 - know like when a clip finished how would
104:54 - i know when a clip finishes because then
104:56 - i could check to see if a clip finishes
104:58 - and i could actually have a current
105:00 - audio array and
105:03 - i could be watching the array
105:06 - check when a clip finishes
105:08 - and then
105:11 - take it out of the array i think that
105:13 - would be the more advanced way to do
105:15 - this
105:21 - let me actually see
105:22 - i know i'm stuck on the repeat but let
105:24 - me see if there's
105:27 - javascript
105:30 - sound
105:31 - no audio
105:33 - audio
105:35 - repeat
105:40 - oh you can do loop
105:43 - i have to try this
105:44 - i have stop so i'll be able to stop it
105:47 - uh
105:50 - let me do
105:52 - loop here
105:53 - so
105:55 - do i do it instead of play is that what
105:58 - i do
105:59 - let me try
106:02 - a dot
106:03 - loop
106:08 - let me do something
106:11 - not too bad
106:15 - no it doesn't play so i think i need to
106:17 - do
106:18 - before play okay
106:21 - so i think i need to
106:25 - uh
106:27 - okay let's try
106:30 - this here
106:34 - didn't work
106:38 - a dot loop is not a function
106:41 - so
106:45 - oh element.lube is true okay
106:48 - all right so it's a property
106:50 - so let's do dot
106:52 - true and
106:55 - try this
106:57 - okay let me
107:00 - refresh
107:02 - shoot
107:03 - turn it all the way up shoot error
107:08 - cool
107:12 - um so i guess i could have a toggle that
107:14 - says loop or not loop
107:19 - but the problem
107:20 - is okay so what i'm gonna do now is
107:24 - actually stop
107:26 - the currently playing sound if there's a
107:28 - current sound
107:30 - i'm gonna call stop first before i set a
107:33 - new audio and do all this stuff
107:35 - because otherwise i'm not going to be
107:37 - able to stop old sounds right now
107:41 - so
107:41 - i'm going to do that real quick so i'm
107:43 - going to run this dot
107:45 - stop
107:48 - first oh wait that's a method
107:52 - so i'll run this dot stop
107:54 - to make sure all other audio stopped
107:56 - because otherwise multiple things might
107:58 - be looping
108:00 - and then
108:01 - i can have a loop toggle
108:04 - so
108:08 - let me do
108:10 - loop
108:12 - and
108:13 - i'll set that to false
108:16 - and i can do
108:20 - a dot loop here as this dot loop
108:26 - and then i'll have a toggle up at the
108:27 - top
108:29 - and i think this will be the last thing
108:31 - that i can do in the stream
108:34 - so
108:36 - the power
108:37 - so okay
108:38 - um
108:40 - let me put this loop maybe i'll just put
108:43 - it
108:45 - around the
108:47 - in the second row with the volume
108:50 - and let me say loop
108:52 - loop oh
108:55 - loop
108:59 - and
109:02 - let me say loop
109:06 - okay
109:09 - so oh that's kind of messy
109:14 - um
109:16 - something's wrong here
109:18 - this dot current audio dot pause is not
109:20 - a function
109:22 - oh because if
109:25 - if the current audio is stopped already
109:28 - i guess it
109:30 - removes itself or it's no longer a
109:33 - callable method
109:35 - so
109:37 - i'm going to have to say
109:42 - uh
109:44 - hmm what should i do so
109:46 - if
109:47 - this dot
109:49 - no wait if this dot
109:54 - um where is it current
109:57 - current audio
110:02 - wait
110:03 - let me just do a try catch here
110:05 - that's probably the quickest thing to
110:08 - do try and then
110:12 - catch
110:17 - so
110:18 - i'll just log out the error
110:21 - not as an error
110:24 - but just says that oh yeah i need to
110:25 - close the catch all right
110:30 - so
110:37 - yeah i'm logged out here okay that's
110:39 - looping properly so let me stop
110:42 - didn't throw an error because it was
110:44 - still playing that time
110:45 - so
110:47 - let me turn loop off
110:52 - so looping does work this is messy let
110:54 - me fix the mess
110:56 - in the top real quick
110:57 - um
110:59 - i wonder if that should be
111:02 - below
111:03 - like i could do another b row maybe
111:06 - if there are more options
111:09 - and then i can
111:11 - add oops
111:12 - i can add looping there
111:15 - of course in these other b rows there
111:18 - are
111:23 - more styling options so maybe i want to
111:26 - add those too
111:28 - hey i didn't get the space in there
111:31 - okay
111:33 - okay that's better
111:36 - it's not
111:37 - really good looking but at least it's
111:39 - not on top of each other
111:49 - okay cool
111:53 - um yeah so i guess that's it for the
111:56 - drum machine let me push my code what i
111:58 - have from today
112:00 - so
112:01 - let me
112:02 - i'm inside the drum app right now let me
112:05 - just see the up one directory
112:07 - in case i've changes from there
112:10 - and let's see get status
112:13 - oh yeah because i moved clips.js so good
112:16 - i'll catch all those changes too so let
112:18 - me do
112:20 - git
112:21 - add
112:22 - um wait let me
112:25 - make sure i did my get ignore properly
112:27 - first
112:31 - so i have a git ignore yeah i just
112:33 - wanted to make sure i had added my git
112:35 - ignore first okay so that should handle
112:37 - all that so i can do get status
112:41 - that will add the view app and the drum
112:43 - machine so do git
112:45 - add just add everything
112:47 - git commit
112:49 - dash m
112:51 - uh code oh drum machine code
112:56 - from
112:58 - live stream
113:01 - on july 3rd
113:05 - cool
113:06 - which is a holiday weekend here in the
113:09 - us
113:13 - thank you sashi it was nice having you
113:15 - thanks for all the help
113:17 - so let me refresh
113:19 - this here
113:21 - cool
113:22 - i think it was more fun after i got the
113:25 - styling worked out at the first 20 30
113:28 - minutes
113:29 - but yeah i'm gonna try to figure out why
113:31 - incline wouldn't work
113:33 - after the stream
113:35 - all right so here's all of the app um
113:40 - the drum machine so markdown previewer
113:42 - and quote machine
113:44 - let's see
113:47 - and then next week so next friday i'll
113:49 - be doing the next app which i actually
113:52 - don't know what it is yet
113:54 - so let's see
113:57 - here's the drum machine oh if i go into
113:59 - learn
114:00 - i can see all the front end projects
114:03 - front and libraries
114:05 - yeah
114:06 - so
114:07 - drum machine oh okay calculator oh i
114:10 - actually built a calculator too uh
114:13 - five years ago
114:15 - i built the calculator actually for this
114:17 - project so i'm going to have to find my
114:18 - old code i definitely did it in react
114:22 - and i think i've done one in jquery too
114:25 - so
114:25 - yeah we'll see i'll probably be
114:28 - shocked at what my code looked like back
114:30 - then
114:32 - all right yeah uh
114:34 - javascript calculator and then a
114:36 - pomodoro clock i remember my pomodoro
114:39 - clock that was like
114:40 - it looks kind of like a time machine
114:42 - really weird ufo style
114:45 - so those two are coming in the future
114:47 - and then after that i want to build kind
114:49 - of a bigger project
114:51 - more of the style that i do on my
114:53 - regular channel
114:55 - yeah thanks tech stats thanks for
114:57 - joining me in the chat it was nice
114:59 - getting to chat with everyone this week
115:02 - um yeah if you are interested in vjs
115:05 - like view content i publish view videos
115:08 - and live streams on my faraday academy
115:10 - channel if you want to check it out
115:12 - thanks bruce thanks for watching yeah i
115:15 - hope you learned something from today
115:18 - and

115:29 - take care

Cleaned transcript:

hi everyone welcome to another live stream um if you don't know me my name is gwen and i run another youtube channel called faraday academy where i do programming tutorials and live streams mostly mostly python and vue.js javascript topics so today is a continuation of building the free code camp projects live in vue.js so last week i did the markdown previewer and this week i'm going to go to the drum machine let me just zoom in here so these should be linked in the description below and you can go to my github which is at gwen f and this is called free code camp projects view and then i have each project in its own folder with a readme yeah so for today i'm going to be starting a view app with the vcli using incline which is a view ui framework for styling and design components that kind of thing and this is basically the um mockup for the drum machine now i did find sounds for this already just because i didn't want to be scrounging for sounds here so i came up with these sounds that i edited myself but they're in the wrong format and won't play in the browser for some reason so i ended up getting some random sounds in this clip.js file here so they won't sound exactly like a drum so it's going to be more like a sound machine than a drum machine yeah that's a horse so if anyone has better sounds uh let me know but these were the easiest they're just mp3 files from sound bible which sound bible has all these um free sounds sometimes you have to give attribution and sometimes their public domain so it depends which sound just one second i'm gonna pull up the chat real quick and and okay good let me see who's here if you're here go ahead and say hi and feel free to give me comments or recommendations as i'm going along with the live stream this will be interesting because i generally don't work with sound in the browser when building applications but there's also a couple other applications i want to build with sound in the future like a music app so uh hopefully uh hey tech stats hi sassy uh yeah thanks for joining me feel free to um chime in as i'm programming today all right so yeah there's a couple other sound apps i want to build in the future so this should be a good project to i guess lean on later so first thing let me start here so first thing i need to create a view app so i already have the view cli installed so i'm going to do view create and let's call this drum machine i guess it's in a folder called drum machine so maybe i'll just call this drum app all right and it should give me my options yeah so let's see do i want anything let me just go into manual um do i want progressive web app support that's easy to add later i don't need routing it's just going to be one page this time view x don't think so do i want sass um i think i'll be okay without sass let me put it in just in case and i'm not gonna do testing so i'll use regular dart sass eslint i'm going to do just the basic island seems to go better in live streams when it's not giving me errors all the time lint on save yeah that's good and then i want dedicated config files save the preset no all right so that's installing what's the difference between sass and dart sass they're both implementations of sass i think dart sass is the most popular and i want to say it's the fastest but i'm not sure anymore um i think it's just what most people use like there was i guess ruby sass and a couple other projects sas built in different ways but it's the same implementation the only i guess the only two different types of sas are indented syntax and the scss style and those and you can use either of those styles with any of the implementations um all right should be done in a minute okay it's installing booking generators from the plugins that i installed which is just sas oh i guess i did babble too which is just one of the default ones i just launched to if you're interested in view cli plugins i just created a video on my channel faraday academy where i show how to create plugins and kind of how they work under the hood um it was pretty interesting for me to learn about so maybe you'd enjoy it too all right so now let's see now i have oh wow so drum machine i thought i was inside of drum machine already so drum app i'm going to move drum app inside of the drum machine folder now so let's see because all the other apps are inside of their their folders for that app so move drum machine to no move drum app to drum machine okay so now yeah i only have the three folders one for each project and now if i uh cd into drum machine cool i see drum app so let me open this in the code editor then go in here and then i'll also go ahead and cd into um drum app and then i'm going to start my view server so npm run server all right and that always takes a minute to build and let me put my browser in the middle all right so now that's building and actually first i'm going to install the incline library and probably the best way to do that is through the cli install so i'll just add this real quick so then i'm gonna have to rerun uh uncommitted changes yeah that's fine okay so that should only take a second to install and set it up for me what's nice about using the vue cli plugins is that they set up all the configuration so i can just start using the components without setting anything else up okay so first thing i'm going to do is set up the grid so let me go to the drum machine mockup so it's a pretty simple mockup i just want basically this box to be centered and then i want a panel on top that i guess has some controls like you can turn it off and on there's some volume in the name of the sound that's being played which i just gave them names and objects so that have a name and then each one of these panels or buttons or whatever they're going to be um when you click on it it'll make that sound um okay successfully invoked okay so now incline is installed i don't think i need to install anything else right now so i'm just going to do npm run serve to start the development server and then i'll be able to see my app localhost 8080. okay and in my source directory i want these clips this clips.js file so i'm just going to drag that in here let's see yeah i'll just put it in the root for now um all right let me see and my server's not running let's see module build failed compound selectors may no longer be extended hmm okay so this is an incline problem i already have an error but where is this coming from um it's coming from the actual incline components so in the node modules i don't know if there's anything i can do about it except maybe downgrade my version of incline balsamic so let me see balsamic balsamic mockups is i think it's a super easy tool for developers people who aren't professional designers to just quickly make mockups they have an online version now um but i have the desktop app because i like it a little bit better but they both work i think the online one's a subscription model okay so root style sheet consider extend to yeah so this is a problem inside of the incline library let me go to their github page and look at their issues and see what people are doing i'm sure someone else has had that issue because that's literally the first thing i did when i set up the app i wonder let's see yeah let me copy this component selectors may no longer be extended okay so this is a recent issue yeah it seems like it's the same thing that i'm having this shouldn't be happening on a clean installation which version of node sas okay so what i might do actually is all right so let me see read me saurus public okay um let me see so it's setting up incline importing incline components registering them so what i might do is i could just uninstall incline and then get rid of the plugin and then manually add it because what might be causing the error is let's see let me go back to getting started is that i gave it this customizable flag oh let's see and its dependencies have been added to your package.json node sas and sas loader let me just check the versions of those real quick let's see um sass loader and node sas okay and then yeah i have incline and of course the plugin that installed incline so it's a sas problem okay so i wonder if i restart all of this and i'm going to try this out again later to see if i should open a bug or a new issue with this uh because i literally didn't do anything after i set this app up so it shouldn't be giving me an error already okay so if shaking let me look at the getting started i wonder if i just do this instead if i'm not importing certain components or passing in any options what that's going to do it's rebuilding nope it's still doing it so yeah it's a sass problem so i wonder if i should be using ink line i just used this in the last project and it worked totally fine so all right so i guess i'm going to be using a different framework um let me try um view bootstrap that should work and we can start all over again read this solution in a github issue you mean on incline i think i went i didn't see any of the issues that had to do with mine it was just that one closed issue where there was no solution oh if you tried to post a link i don't think free code camp is letting you post a link so i can't see it um can you just tell give me the issue number and okay and point node sas from the webpack like this conses equals require node sas let me see let me look at the issue customizing not working um okay let me see is issue 170 oh this is a next though getting a compile error module whoops module build failed bug report okay yeah this is what i have okay yeah this is the same issue though so i don't know which one it's which issue unless you give me an issue number i had to remove sas default dart sas to point at node sas um let's see transpiling dependencies i could point it i don't know do i want to do this i kind of want to start just building the drum app i think for this um i can change it later but i think right now i'm just going to use bootstrap view until i figure out what's wrong with incline and i don't believe i believe this is just an npm install let's see yeah so it's it's not recommending me to you are using okay so i have to install bootstrap view and bootstrap okay icons plugin all right so let me just install this real quick and this will just i just need a basic grid system and some styling that's it okay um that's installing so there's no plugin i just have to set it up in my view file in my main view file where i render from so main.js and i'll put it in here okay and then i guess i'll just get rid of these and i could uninstall incline from here and install incline and the plugin okay cool that installed just fine so i'm gonna do an npm uninstall the plugin and uh let's see ink line view is imported twice now i might have done that yeah okay thank you and actually i'm gonna change the order of those imports all right and now okay so import bootstrap view and then just view dot use okay let me do bootstrap view and then if i want icons later i'll do that okay and now i'll do npm run serve and i think so incline's a pretty lightweight um library so i don't think it gave me extra setup like some of the larger ui libraries did yeah i don't see its own folder or anything here so i think i got rid of it yeah it doesn't even change the setup in the app.view file okay icon's plugin is defined but never used yeah all right so um i'll just add it okay so that built okay cool it's working now and i guess i'll just be using the view bootstrap system um okay so components actually i think grid yeah layout and grid system so it's basically all prefixed from b container b row and just by i think this gives me all the components like i don't have to individually import and register components because i just registered the whole library so let me try out i'll just start programming in my main file my main app.view file and then i'm going to break up components as i need them break things up into components let me get rid of all this styling too okay so first thing i'm going to do is a v container to start off my grid system and then uh oh wait it's b i'm getting all these uh libraries confused so for bootstrap it's b and b okay and then it will be b row inside and then b column i think it's just call yeah be call okay and then here is where i can put it in the middle of the page so let me put something in here first just some text okay drum and now from here i can give it the regular classes so or maybe there are props here let me look in columns yeah so i'll pass it in as a prop instead of as a class so i'll do column for so this will just be for all screen sizes so six six columns wide and then how do i do offset okay offset equals so i think i can just do offset equals three all right so that didn't work um so first let me see if there's an error here uh type checked for prop call expected boolean got string with value of six um oh i think it's calls isn't it i think it is calls let me see yeah calls so here calls okay so that didn't give me an error but it's still let me just see if i inspect this let me inspect the text okay so row container class of column six and i wonder why they have examples they don't really have oh they do okay um let's see yeah this one says calls eight so i should be able to do that let's see i have b column so b call b call and then calls of six and then oh my offset is wrong ah yeah thank you that's so strong okay it's still not working um so let's see offset why wouldn't offset be working did i have an example with offset they do have auto so i think that centers it and alignment i guess that's flexbox so you can use flexbox let's see all right so offset let me just try to do um instead of just general calls let me try to do a small and then i can do offset hyphen small see if that works that's weird recall medium offset medium i'm closing the column uh all right so let me put content in here and see if i just if something else is going to change it i guess because that's weird yeah i'm doing it exactly like the examples say let me even copy paste the example and let me do another row so all right oh wait i wanted to put a row in here so b row and then let's see maybe the css is not being loaded correctly yeah that's true because it's not working at all does it say because i didn't think it said i thought um let's see oh it does say to add imports so add import bootstrap view okay so let me put this in the main.js file and that should fix it ah okay all right that was a lot of time spent on that thanks for the help okay let me get rid of that extra row then okay and yeah oh man i guess i've like i'm so used to setting it up um setting up component libraries just by using a plugin so i do view add and then it sets it up for me so i forgot i can't believe i forgot to check for the css um all right so now finally i have the drum machine so this is actually going to be two cards so the top card and the bottom card with the um sound buttons oops with the sound buttons or whatever these are inside so let me look for cards here okay cards so just a basic card and then i guess i can nest inside the cards with text or just put components directly inside all right so let me just start off with the basic card so b card and then close it and then oh yeah second one so now i have two and let's see let me start to put the controls inside so actually i put volume in the mockup here but i have no idea how to do sound volume in the browser so yeah i'll have to figure that out um power should be easy just make it work or not work and then the sound name should be easy so let me uh let's see so let me do what do you call those things switches switch style uh check box um yeah that looks okay i don't know why it's so small oh that goes into other so here are just the switches this okay so i can put a prop large i'm definitely going to put a prop large on that so it's just a prop that denotes it as a switch so it's a regular checkbox and then you pass it a switch prop and it makes it a switch okay so oh cool and then it'll just give me the label so i guess i'll put the label to the right that's fine um i'm not really picky about that so a lot a large switch and i'll call it the power switch so let's see cool so that switches on and off all right um now what was the next one oh a slider for volume so let me try to find a slider do i call it a slider um it's not a carousel i mean it would be in forms somewhere maybe if i scroll does anyone know what that's called which is all right maybe i mean view bootstrap might just not have that so how else would you control volume just up and down i guess we could skip the volume for now and then if we needed it we could add in another library that has a slider on it that wouldn't be a big deal yeah it seems like it doesn't have it unless it's in one of these other um ones rating is stars right yeah it's kind of cool um time picker input group check box bar spinner yeah i don't see one here oh well oh is it called range oh range type input okay oh they do have one cool all right is this the only example they have oh with different step values okay yeah the basic one is is good so basically it's a b form input and then give it a type of range all right okay i'll just put it after the power and see how that looks so id range um i don't even think i'll need an id here um v model i'm gonna have to set up the v models min max that's fine okay so let me see all right that looks okay um i wonder now should i put the volume i guess i could put the volume yeah make it a lot smaller and put it next to sound because you really don't need the whole width for volume unless i put volume at the bottom and put power and the sound title here and then put volume below it um let's see also if i pass in if i pass something into the form input component um that probably won't be a label yeah because it's not like a checkbox so let me try to i'll make that selfclosing and maybe i can pass in a label which is volume okay nope doesn't take label so it doesn't have a list of props here no range inputs return their value as a string you may need to convert the value yeah does not include styling for range inputs inside input groups however bootstrap u includes custom styling to handle these situations until styling is included in bootstrap okay so bootstrap 5 just came out so i'm guessing bootstrap 5 has styling for this i think maybe it's still in alpha i'm not sure anyway uh let me add the box here to show the name first and then i'll figure out what i'm gonna do with the volume where i'm gonna put it i guess i saw a library on github vue bootstrap slider yeah i thought some people called it slider i feel like i've used it as a slider before or maybe it's like the whole dialogue modal thing everyone's starting to call it a dialogue and we seem to be losing the name modal to standardize it um okay b form input uh and then i guess so i guess i'll be putting rows and columns inside of this card so if i do a b row here and close the b row and then let me put a check box or not a check box let me put the name box inside this row and then um let's see also this is this is quite zoomed in if i zoom out a little bit it's more accurate so let me put uh i don't know a div do they have paper i'm not sure if they have um paper so what do i do if i want this with like a just a regular box like an outline box without using another card element so in beautify they have something called paper and i'm not sure i guess i can just style it myself that might be the easiest thing to do okay i'm just gonna style it just make a box a regular div and i'm gonna call it class equals name box search for border so borders are the classes they have right for borders um sidebar styling borders border border yeah these are utility classes for borders so border right border danger those ones okay so i can still make my own div here and might not have to do a custom class because then i can just use their utility classes for spacing too um so what is this let me let me just put a placeholder here sound name and here let's see let me get out of components so where are their utility classes let me search bootstrap for utility classes okay so this shows these are utility classes from for spacing um inside the layout grid system okay so where would the maybe these utility classes yeah border utilities okay it takes me to the actual bootstrap so okay so i guess i just use the these classes from bootstrap um so i can do border and then i don't think i want border danger or anything okay cool it gave me a border and now i can add some margin or padding classes so let me do padding all now let me do padding let's see on the x axis of four boost strap has a funky way of calculating padding and margin that isn't just multiplying so i think four is something like 16 pixels or close to it maybe and then this should be something around six or eight pixels okay i think that looks pretty good for a box but it's not at all aligned here so what i could do is add some i guess css or um what do i call that flexbox classes inside the row um so let me see let me add a class of and actually this row i don't know if the rows default to display flex already let me see let me look inside row yeah it's already defaulting to display flex yeah thanks so i don't need to put display flex in here so i can i think i can just use flex um elements now so i could do um what is it justify um justify content oh it's giving me all of them cool uh justify content space between is the one i want so let me start typing justify content space between and oh it gave me an underscore did he start with underscores why did i do that i don't know if i did that okay so it said the row already has display flex but maybe it doesn't let me try if that makes a difference no so uh let me get rid of that okay um so does anyone know why this isn't pushing let me look in the dev tools and see okay so in the div okay so here display flex flex wrap and it's not justified content so the class isn't correct then so let me go into the bootstrap flex classes oh i guess this would be in the utility classes as well so let me look in regular bootstrap for flex utilities um so where is it justify content there and justify content okay so it's just justify content between so oh i put space between okay sweet okay that works um all right that's pretty good now i do want to add some margin to the row just in general and also to the card because it's pushed up against everything else so i'm going to add some um oh wait i think i have to put it inside a class so margin all or margin top of four let's see okay that's good that pushes the top card down and um let's see i'd also want a margin i guess for each card i'll just add a margin top margin top class equals margin top of four okay that looks pretty good and i don't want these to be so close to the edges so let me add a margin let's see i guess to the row here so i can add a margin more uh margin on the xaxis of two okay that looks much better all right so i have the sound name i have the power bar and then i like volume being below that was too many things squished into one row but i need some kind of a title for it um let me put it in its own row first so it matches the rest of the content so b row b row okay and now i have the input so i guess i will want an id actually if i'm going to give it a label so the id will just be volume i guess oops volume and then label for volume okay and then um yeah just volume inside the label all right and then i wanted to give this the same kind of margin spacing that i gave to the top row so i'll add class equals m x of 2 and then i want some margin top between the top row as well so let me see how that looks actually i want more margin between the top row okay cool i think that looks pretty good what do you think and yeah and now i need the buttons in the bottom card so let me see b row b card okay so in this card i want to do did i get rid of my class here i thought i had a class of margin i guess i got rid of it at some point margin top of four and now i want to have basically square boxes that are displayed i'm going to be looping through them too so i'm going to want some kind of flex wrap so that i can loop through them all so let's see yeah thanks um so it's basically like the first hour trying to get the styling set up in the second hour actually doing the vjs work um okay so let me just i guess just create squares right there's no like actual square class somewhere um eventually it would be cool to have one icon in each button but uh should they be buttons i guess they should be buttons even though they're square not rectangle i think it would make sense so i'm guessing it's b btn maybe let's see where are the buttons it's been a while since i used bootstrap i think it has i don't remember the last time i did oh by the way one thing i found the other day someone sent me i think is boot swatch it was they have all these free themes for bootstrap and there are also components and other things which i thought was pretty cool that you can just use any of these things to make bootstrap look a lot nicer uh yeah maybe if i make this drum app look nice i might use one alright so here's a button okay so it's spelled out b button and then i can give it a variant if i want i'll probably have outlined buttons maybe um so it's b button and then um let me just close it for now and then i'll put sound or x or i don't know let's see let's see how that looks okay okay that's actually square so we're kind of square anyway now let me make that bigger maybe if i just add enough padding that will come out to be a big square button so class equals although if i had a div i would just set the size of it instead of the padding so padding all four um does it like that did i yeah i gave it the correct padding you know what i don't think button is the is the right thing for this i think i'm going to use a div div and then i'll just put an x inside because that way it's not dependent on what's inside of it for spacing versus just padding a button so let me do class equals padding oh i guess i'm padding this too i'm going to just set the side is the size of these so let's do class um sound sound button i don't know okay so sound button and now in my style tag i can style sound button and padding all okay bootstrap does p4 all right thanks um so i'm gonna do width of 50 pixels height is 50 pixels because i want to set absolute heights and widths on these okay so i can tell it got bigger just by why isn't it yeah that's 50 by 50. so this is actually going to have to be like 200 by 200. um 50 is not very big 200 pixels oh did i get rid of pixels okay so 200 by 200 and then i'm gonna need to make the parent here so um this should already be oh no this is inside a card so what i'm going to do now is do a b row because i want to wrap all the buttons so i can loop through them and then i think b row has not just flex display flex set but i think it has um flex that row wrap so it'll just wrap the containers around all right so inside of the row and now i'll do i'm still gonna want i guess justify content center okay and then let me start looping through something here to display these buttons so let me import clips into this file so let me import because i'm exporting this array of objects from clips so it's not json or anything so i can just import that array so clips from clips and then let's see clips let me put it on data here so let's make a data function turn the object and do the clips array so now there should be nine clips in that file if i counted correctly so now i can inside this sound button i can let me put it on a few rows i can do v4 equals clip in clips and then the key i'm just going to use clip dot name which all of them are unique so because i already know that cool so it's a little bit off but it's displaying nine of them let me make these uh a little bit smaller so let me try 160 160. okay i think that's okay if i center them and spread them out a little bit and now let me add a border so i can actually see where they are so class i'm going to add a border here cool i think that's actually pretty good uh i don't like that i can't scroll down past this let me just uh instead of margin uh just top i'm gonna replace that with the yaxis so now i can scroll down a little bit past the bottom okay so um let's see what do i want to do these should be a little bit spaced and the x needs to be centered vertically and horizontally which i can do with flexbox and let me space these out just a little bit so on the cards i can do margin of 1. okay all right that looks good and now for the border actually let me do border of oh can i do any color fuchsia does that work no i think it has to be one of those standard colors like warning or something yeah now the border changed okay i'm gonna leave it like that um i think it looks pretty good um oh yeah one more thing is that the border uh that these cards have a border radius but the things that i built do not so let me see what the border radius on these are border um hmm am i on the right one let's see computed yeah it should be here border left border yeah here it is four pixels okay so border top left radius 4 pixels so they just set them individually okay so i want these cards to have 4 pixel radius because it seems like everything else does and i'll put it here too so i think they have a utility class for um border radiuses let's see here we go um rounded okay add border classes so i guess rounded would be i don't i feel like these sizes should be standard and they don't say what the sizes are anywhere let me see what this actually means so if i look at oh that's an svg will that show me oh that's 3.2 pixels and what's this one okay so oh well i mean it's close enough i'll get a little bit of a round so let me do rounded large um okay that's fine rounded large it's close enough to four for me anyway and let me put that class here too oh let me put it next to the other border class all right okay i think that looks good it seems to match up enough anyway um okay so now i have all the buttons let me just do one more styling thing which is move this x to center it here and how do i do that let's see um i already have so many classes here it's just so many classes so i'm just gonna put them inside of here then uh let me put um so display flex oh wait i can't do that down here display flex uh align let me do justify first so justify con content center align can i do a line item center let's see okay cool awesome and now i have everything centered so even if i type text in there like instead of the x i could do um let's say clip oh wait let me put this in the double curly braces so clip dot name i could put the name of the clip in there oh cool i think that's actually better for right now because there's no icon associated with the clip so to have the name of it um you can tell these aren't drums or anything um although i do have a drum set at my house i was thinking about recording myself do it but i'd have to move my whole audio setup into another room to record each sound and i just said okay well i'm just going to use these free mp3 files oh one more thing one more thing i do want to style um so on hover oops hover i do want to style let's see um was it oh the mouse pointer so uh cursor is it pointer cursor cursor pointer i think it's cursor pointer yeah and now i have it looks like it's clickable cool so it's not perfect styling but it's okay i think okay thanks yeah i can't i can't remember i've uh css is is just a memorization language kind of so it's like if you're not in it every day it's like you forget the exact terms you have to use i guess so what do i want to do next so i have i have all the clips um let's try to play sounds right so let's let's make a function a method here so methods oh no i hope you can hear the sounds uh oh wait i think i have system audio muted but maybe i can uh make it so you can hear well let me get the sounds playing first and see if you can hear them so let's see a play clip so this function it's gonna have to take in the name of the sound that url so i'm gonna have to pass in the exact clip and then this is where i'm planning on using the what is it javascript the audio constructor so audio not the html5 audio tag but the uh well this this should come up somewhere new audio yeah this is it um not a lot of details here all right yeah so basically i can create new audio element and play sounds in the browser um that's yeah that's as much as i can say about that i thought it would show like oh yeah here so once you create that audio element you can do dot play and yeah there are other things called like pause dot pause i should really contribute to that documentation um with some examples all right so that's that's what i'm gonna be using and i think that i can pass these in dynamically which i hope is going to work so let's do let's let s equal new audio so use the javascript constructor and then i'll pass in the clip which actually let me call it clip url so there's no confusion about what i'm passing in not the whole object just passing in the url and then s is now this audio object so now i should be able to do s dot play all right so no pause feature or anything yet um but that's okay so i guess to do pause i'd have to put it on data and do some other things i don't know to capture which clip is playing so i could pause it so okay so now when i click on this button i need to have some kind of i guess i'll just put in an act click to capture the click event directly on that div for my square buttons so um at click is oh yeah the method i just made play clip and then pass in the clip url so let's see pass in the clip dot what did i call that an eclipse oh i called it clip so it's clip.clip i'm gonna change this real quick sorry one second so clip replace it with url okay that is much better now it's just url okay so now i can do clip dot url pass that into play clip and i'm gonna make sure my volume is on yeah yes can you hear that it says that system audio is playing through my stream so i do like the puppy sounds though okay thanks thanks for confirming that um all right so this plays the clip that feels good oh yeah the sound name i need to be capturing which sound is playing so i can update the sound name cool hi bruce how are you um let's see i guess yeah i'll just have like current sound current clip since i'm using the clip terminology uh so let's say empty string at first um and then our latest clip because it's not current clip if it doesn't change after the clip ends so our last played last played i don't know that's fine um so let me do so i'll do this dot last played equals okay and then in this case i can't just pass in the clip url i'm going to have to pass in the whole clip so i'll have to pass in the name and the url and then here i'll update this to url and then last played will be set to the name okay so now i have to update that here so oops um oh wait wait uh here i'll just pass in the whole clip and then i'm pulling url and name off of that and what's the other thing oh yeah the sound name so i'm gonna have to put last played here oh that kind of stinks because when it's empty it turns into the shriveled thing i'm gonna have to put a default sound okay yeah i'm gonna have to put some a default there no sound or something so it doesn't just fold um with no text inside okay cool all right so let me hook up the power switch then and see so what should i do for the power switch um i guess i the easiest thing to do would be to put something on data like a boolean on or off and then have an if statement inside play clip um but what i should actually do is make these disabled so you can't click on them or show that they're disabled like gray them out somehow so i could do a class okay let me first let me v model the check box here so put this on two lines so the pat that power switch let me remodel that so i can capture the value equals um power should i do is power no because power can mean different things so is on oh no in javascript i should do a camel case so is on so in data now i'll do is on oh let me start off with true and then you can turn it off if you want okay cool so it's definitely mapping now because it starts off as true and then it goes off all right so now i have to disable these buttons which i'm going to do through an if statement unless someone else has a better idea so and then i can add a class to the buttons to kind of show the user that they're disabled since they're not actual buttons they're divs so i'll just change the class or something oh yeah instead of sound button maybe i'll have disabled button or something i don't know okay so if um this dot is on then i can do all that stuff all right but now it's off it doesn't do anything sweet um but now i don't want these classes so i want to gray them out somehow so i don't know should what should i do an overlay um or something let me make a new class here so let's call this um button disabled and say uh now let's change the border color i guess border now will be gray so okay so now if it's off oh i'm not actually applying the clasp oh man okay so button disabled now i have to conditionally toggle the class so let's see um how do i want to do this so because there's a bunch of classes here so let me see so i can do object syntax or array syntax and if i want to toggle um so i think let me look this up so vue.js dynamic classes and yeah i think if i do object syntax i can put the rest of the classes after the object right and then i don't have to um put them all inside the object so i could just have no i don't think i can do that so i think maybe i need an array here then so maybe i need an object inside of an array uh let's see and then this would be inside of a string and then inside the object it would be um so i'd be checking is is on and then if it is on then i want my class button disabled so i'm going to have to put that in quotes so button disabled so it doesn't like this so i think i need a comma here maybe oh yeah it seems to do okay with that that's good so if is on oh if not is ons meaning if it's not on then the button is disabled okay let me try that doesn't like it okay let me see what's going on with the buttons so okay now okay so it is adding the clasp properly because it's it's changing and now it's adding button disabled to all the buttons but my problem is now in my um css so do i do border color but border let's see now i think because it's putting that class first um that's why so i would have to put this class at the end basically let me do this on two lines um so i would have to put this class at the end so actually i'm gonna get this out and paste it after oh yeah and then put that back okay so now it should work no it doesn't work it doesn't like that um let's see why isn't changing the border color though so i have button disabled here and it's called button disabled here that's good it might still be putting the class at the beginning okay so border bottom color border left color i mean for this small app i could just do an important statement because it's not overwriting it so i'm wondering if that's what bootstrap has let me look at the rules yeah that's what they're doing they're doing border color importance so to overwrite they're important i'm going to have to use another important statement because that's how important to work everything is more important all right so that's fine whatever it's not okay that's good and now if it's on it goes orange and if it's off it goes yeah that's what i have right now um i don't know maybe you said that a long time ago though about the sound button i don't know how how long the leg is right now hopefully it's not too long but sometimes on youtube it can get a bit long yeah this is the same thing i had maybe it wasn't when you said that comment though oh i guess it's not because it's not is on but yeah the important did it because bootstrap is using important statements but i want to look at i want to make it look like more disabled than it is you know because this looks like it still could be a button oh also the pointer the pointer needs to go away i should do an either or class really um except i want some of these things like actually i want all of these things except the hover so um oh you know what i could do though is border warning what if i put this inside here too so that way i don't need the border gray right let me see let me take out the border gray and see because that way if it's not on oh now it's opposite oh right um okay well never mind because i forgot i'm doing it if it's not on display these classes okay so that was a bad idea let me go back i could do another um so i could i guess i could do a ternary here like is on and i don't know would that be inside a nested like look let me see if i can do a ternary here um and do so here i would have to do i would have to do is on yeah i could do two objects um that would definitely work i'm going to try to do this so let me get rid of that and then i can do so if it's on oh no no i don't want the button to be disabled let's see i want border warning oh wait and then if it's not on i want the other one i think this is going to work and that way i don't have to do two objects inside i can just check is on once it's not giving me an error so um i think it will work yeah that works cool awesome so let me now change um i don't know should i add an overlay i could add a background just to make it look more disabled like background color of light gray and let me turn it off uh i don't know and then get rid of the um mouse actually you know there's one pointer there's one mouse pointer that has like an x let me look that up because cursor mouse pointers css help wait cross hair cursor cross hair or cursor not allowed um let me see let me see which one which one would look better so now let me go to hover so and hover and then cursor um which which one should i try across here across here oh no that's not what i want i thought this was something different that's not at all that looks like i can drag and select what about not allowed yeah not allowed this one i don't know if you can see it it has the little circle with the line through it in it okay so i'm gonna do not allowed not allowed okay cool now it really looks disabled like you can't do anything and now if i put the power back on you can click on okay uh that all works now so what should i do i guess i should do volume i actually have no idea how to do this i don't think i've ever done volume in the browser let's see um so javascript audio what the audio constructor volume hmm audio context i wonder if it's audio context okay this probably doesn't say anything yeah so that doesn't say anything let me look in audio context real quick interface represents an audio processing graph built from audio uh no i don't think that's what i want create gain create is that what i want uh i really have no idea i could just look straight up like how to set volume in javascript let's see if this is what they're doing okay this person is trying to play and mix multiple sounds play the same sounds interrupt playback let me see if they have volume okay so this was in 2012. the web audio api is now supported although there are a lot of issues no common volume controls let me see the link that it provides oh it goes to the github page okay web audio api editors draft so this is the absolute latest from 2020. um an audio param interface for controlling an individual aspect of an audio node's functioning such as volume i said document dot my audio oh i can change it audio.volume so i could do it here then right so let's see i could do s dot volume equals um 2 or 0.2 0.2 and close this then all right yeah that does work cool thanks um yeah so i guess yeah let me do it uh to equal this dot range and then i'm gonna have to give it a default here so um let's say actually min max so range has a min max where is range here it is so min 0 max 5 and v model of value let me change the value to range or no no let me change it to volume okay so volume and then i'll put it here so this will be volume and let me start it off at two so in the middle and then here it will be volume cool thank you thanks for that nope oh wait i think this does this have to be a zero to one number i think it might have to be let me look at whatever you w3 schools yeah that's what i thought thanks zero to one okay so the leg can't be too bad because that seemed to your comment seemed to come up pretty quick dom audio volume property yeah so this is the same thing dot volume all right let's see so i guess i'll divide it by if it's zero to five man um i can't even think right now so let me divide it by five oh wait right list of volume divided by five and it should be zero to one so by 10 oh cool that works that works really well thanks i divided it by five because my max here is five so it's one to five zero is off anyway because you're going to have 0 divided by 5 so it's 0 so it won't play any sound okay cool i didn't even know how to do volume before today so that's off this on yeah it's not a huge difference but there's a difference thank you thanks for all your help so is there anything else i should do let's see it's been an hour and 37 minutes so it's like 20 more minutes left um what else could you do with a drum machine i guess get actual drum sounds but this was one thing that i didn't realize because i guess i thought i'd have to use the audio tag but it's cool that i can just pass in a url dynamically to the audio constructor and it just plays that's pretty cool i think this is a nice api um oh what if what if we try to set up the pause i think that's going to be a lot harder so pause i think this should actually be stop stop right not pause because i'm not really pausing i'm stopping so um let's see so i'd need i would need this um instance of audio i think i need this stored on data so that i can run stop on it basically because then i could do this dot current clip no no no um like this dot audio current audi current audio maybe because that's the audio object and then i could do dot stop run dot stop or is it dot pause is it there should be a dot stop right but the only one i know for sure is dot pause so let's let me see if this works so i would do current audio which at first would just be an empty object and um what else so oh yeah so i need to actually do that here so then this would be uh this dot current audio and then i would do yeah basically here oh no i would set this after so let me do uh i don't like using s then i guess i could change it to a and then this dot current audio equals a and then i could stop it here basically oh but if i'm just pausing it's going to pause in the middle of the clip then i need to reset it right reset it back to the beginning of the clip let me just see let me see how this works a is not defined um oh oh right so actually i'm not redefining it here so let me do const okay oh yeah i need a stop button how do i stop um should i just do a pause button in the middle here uh i could change it into a pause button until it's done playing and then change it back into the name i think that would be pretty cool let me add a pause button here just so i can test this out real quick up at the top so in between power and last play let me add b button and i guess the variant is it called variant could be i don't know info so it's a different color and then uh what do i want to say oh yeah pause or stop stop okay stop cool and now i can add an ad click to this so at click click equals um oh yeah stop it's just stop that's my method name so let me try this oh it's not fast enough because all these clips are like one second long it's i think it i think it did stop yeah it did okay so stop works and i it didn't sound like i had to reset it do i have to reset it back to zero let me try to stop the van door yeah it does stop and then it does start over again so i guess pause just started the clip over i don't know if that's the intended behavior but that's what it seems to be doing okay so that seems to work um now my cat's meowing for attention um let me actually because everything else is outlined let me outline that button it looks like a eyesore in the middle of everything or i wonder if i should just put stop no because then i would have to know i would have to time when the clip stopped and then change it back to the name i don't have time for all that because i don't think i have time to figure out how to do that but that would be an interesting thing if i could do that let me just fix the button for right now let me fix oh i can just do outline dash so let me do outline dash then info so outline dash info okay that looks a bit better yeah and this looks clickable this looks like it's not clickable so that's good there should be a resume if you want to resume but i'm not sure if it's saving the current like is it saving the current state so when i stop is it saving that because i guess play starts over at zero thanks way funnier i could actually make music like this there should be a repeat like i should be able to toggle these on repeat so you can actually make a song um i wonder how to do that so let's see also right now stop if i'm doing multiple things it just stops the last one not like every single sound what do you mean no no you don't like the random sounds or no it's not music or i don't know what no means or you don't want repeat i guess that's not really a drum machine or yeah drum machine you would have repeat oh don't mix these sounds oh don't don't mix them because if i have repeat then i'll have the horse sound over and over again with poker chips and everything yeah they're not the best sounds to put together um okay well so some ideas were that i could do resume on the sound um but the sound starts over so i i guess also i'm when i play it again i'm setting this to a new current audio so yeah i wonder if if there's a way to know like when a clip finished how would i know when a clip finishes because then i could check to see if a clip finishes and i could actually have a current audio array and i could be watching the array check when a clip finishes and then take it out of the array i think that would be the more advanced way to do this let me actually see i know i'm stuck on the repeat but let me see if there's javascript sound no audio audio repeat oh you can do loop i have to try this i have stop so i'll be able to stop it uh let me do loop here so do i do it instead of play is that what i do let me try a dot loop let me do something not too bad no it doesn't play so i think i need to do before play okay so i think i need to uh okay let's try this here didn't work a dot loop is not a function so oh element.lube is true okay all right so it's a property so let's do dot true and try this okay let me refresh shoot turn it all the way up shoot error cool um so i guess i could have a toggle that says loop or not loop but the problem is okay so what i'm gonna do now is actually stop the currently playing sound if there's a current sound i'm gonna call stop first before i set a new audio and do all this stuff because otherwise i'm not going to be able to stop old sounds right now so i'm going to do that real quick so i'm going to run this dot stop first oh wait that's a method so i'll run this dot stop to make sure all other audio stopped because otherwise multiple things might be looping and then i can have a loop toggle so let me do loop and i'll set that to false and i can do a dot loop here as this dot loop and then i'll have a toggle up at the top and i think this will be the last thing that i can do in the stream so the power so okay um let me put this loop maybe i'll just put it around the in the second row with the volume and let me say loop loop oh loop and let me say loop okay so oh that's kind of messy um something's wrong here this dot current audio dot pause is not a function oh because if if the current audio is stopped already i guess it removes itself or it's no longer a callable method so i'm going to have to say uh hmm what should i do so if this dot no wait if this dot um where is it current current audio wait let me just do a try catch here that's probably the quickest thing to do try and then catch so i'll just log out the error not as an error but just says that oh yeah i need to close the catch all right so yeah i'm logged out here okay that's looping properly so let me stop didn't throw an error because it was still playing that time so let me turn loop off so looping does work this is messy let me fix the mess in the top real quick um i wonder if that should be below like i could do another b row maybe if there are more options and then i can add oops i can add looping there of course in these other b rows there are more styling options so maybe i want to add those too hey i didn't get the space in there okay okay that's better it's not really good looking but at least it's not on top of each other okay cool um yeah so i guess that's it for the drum machine let me push my code what i have from today so let me i'm inside the drum app right now let me just see the up one directory in case i've changes from there and let's see get status oh yeah because i moved clips.js so good i'll catch all those changes too so let me do git add um wait let me make sure i did my get ignore properly first so i have a git ignore yeah i just wanted to make sure i had added my git ignore first okay so that should handle all that so i can do get status that will add the view app and the drum machine so do git add just add everything git commit dash m uh code oh drum machine code from live stream on july 3rd cool which is a holiday weekend here in the us thank you sashi it was nice having you thanks for all the help so let me refresh this here cool i think it was more fun after i got the styling worked out at the first 20 30 minutes but yeah i'm gonna try to figure out why incline wouldn't work after the stream all right so here's all of the app um the drum machine so markdown previewer and quote machine let's see and then next week so next friday i'll be doing the next app which i actually don't know what it is yet so let's see here's the drum machine oh if i go into learn i can see all the front end projects front and libraries yeah so drum machine oh okay calculator oh i actually built a calculator too uh five years ago i built the calculator actually for this project so i'm going to have to find my old code i definitely did it in react and i think i've done one in jquery too so yeah we'll see i'll probably be shocked at what my code looked like back then all right yeah uh javascript calculator and then a pomodoro clock i remember my pomodoro clock that was like it looks kind of like a time machine really weird ufo style so those two are coming in the future and then after that i want to build kind of a bigger project more of the style that i do on my regular channel yeah thanks tech stats thanks for joining me in the chat it was nice getting to chat with everyone this week um yeah if you are interested in vjs like view content i publish view videos and live streams on my faraday academy channel if you want to check it out thanks bruce thanks for watching yeah i hope you learned something from today and feel free to leave me a comment below or come over to my channel and you can see how to contact me from there so have a great day everybody take care
