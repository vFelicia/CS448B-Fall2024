00:03 - everyone welcome to live coding with
00:05 - Jessie it's been a few days it's been
00:09 - kind of crazy
00:10 - we had a big ice storm here and
00:13 - everything was covered and I don't know
00:15 - like this much ice it was wild
00:18 - so the offices were closed yesterday I
00:22 - had like unexpected things going on and
00:27 - meetings getting moved around and so I
00:30 - just didn't really have like I wasn't
00:35 - confident that I would have enough time
00:36 - to stream so today I'm gonna catch you
00:41 - up with some of the things that I've
00:42 - been doing some pool requests and then
00:45 - we're gonna work a little bit on the
00:46 - layout for the homepage so to understand
00:50 - why I'm doing this let me tell you
00:52 - what's what's been happening so I all
01:00 - right let me how to try to start from
01:03 - the beginning here okay so some people
01:09 - higher up in the university that I work
01:13 - for have decided that they don't want
01:18 - the website to go live by the end of
01:22 - this month which is what we were
01:23 - shooting for we'll see if that stands
01:29 - from from what I understand I wasn't
01:32 - involved in any of these meetings but
01:35 - from what I understand I think that
01:37 - there's a misunderstanding here about
01:39 - with this website kind of redesigned and
01:44 - development is involving and I think
01:47 - there's a fear that it's going to be
01:50 - such a big change that prospective
01:52 - students are going to be confused so now
01:58 - I'm gonna have meetings with different
02:03 - groups of people within the university
02:04 - some different people you know higher up
02:07 - in the university and I'm gonna demo
02:09 - this website to them
02:12 - show them what we're doing explain it my
02:15 - hope is that after people see how far
02:19 - along this is and and what we're
02:21 - actually doing then they'll be okay with
02:24 - us launching now if we have to push back
02:28 - the launch date we have to but it's
02:30 - going to cost you know the university
02:33 - some extra money to renew the contract
02:34 - for the old websites content management
02:37 - system so I'd rather not push it back if
02:39 - it's unnecessary if the reason we push
02:42 - it back is simply because you know
02:44 - there's a misunderstanding then that's
02:48 - even if it's not that much money it's
02:51 - still a waste you know it's a waste of
02:53 - money so I'm gonna do what I can in
02:57 - terms of the meetings but that changes
02:59 - the plan a little bit for how we we
03:01 - develop this so the plan right now is
03:03 - get the homepage looking as good as
03:07 - possible and as functional as possible
03:09 - right away like within the next few days
03:13 - well today and then the next few days of
03:16 - next week's like Monday Tuesday
03:18 - Wednesday I have to present it to the
03:22 - first group on Thursday so I just leaves
03:25 - us a few days and then also we want to
03:28 - get as many interior pages as we can
03:31 - looking good
03:32 - so I can demo things so here's what I've
03:35 - been doing to make that happen let me
03:38 - switch over so I can show you on my
03:40 - screen so we have this is kind of small
03:46 - what if I can I can't really zoom in let
03:48 - me take this out of the mobile view so
03:52 - that I can just make it bigger of course
03:54 - we're still doing kind of a mobile first
03:58 - development but so this is one of the
04:02 - things that I've added I know that one
04:05 - of the people who is really concerned
04:07 - probably the main person that is really
04:09 - concerned about the launch date wants to
04:11 - delay it it's also probably going to be
04:15 - looking for this type of thing these
04:18 - student profiles so I brought over some
04:20 - student profiles and I made sure that
04:23 - the images comes
04:24 - and that some videos come through so
04:28 - this is really basic we're gonna have to
04:30 - do some styling on on this kind of thing
04:33 - I don't like that look but overall it
04:39 - came through it came through okay
04:41 - I'll show you what I had I had to do
04:43 - some stuff to get these to come through
04:45 - all right now I'll show you more about
04:47 - that but then also these links on the
04:50 - side I've been adding in the URLs so
04:52 - these will now actually link to the
04:56 - right places the assuming that we have
05:00 - the correct data so let me see alright
05:02 - cool so that one did work these are
05:04 - links and they also use the next link
05:07 - prefetch so that next has a link
05:10 - component built in and then we can add
05:12 - prefetch so that should make the
05:15 - transition between pages extra fast
05:17 - that's another feature I want to really
05:19 - show off is how fast this website is
05:22 - compared to the old one it's going to be
05:24 - fast compared to any website but
05:26 - especially compared to the old one I
05:28 - think that's a huge selling point and
05:30 - maybe I'm going to bring in some
05:33 - statistics on the likely number of
05:36 - prospective students that are actually
05:37 - leaving our current site before it even
05:40 - loads because the load times are so
05:42 - terrible and how many more students we
05:46 - would have if we switch the site over so
05:49 - if anyone has any other ideas of things
05:51 - that I could bring up potentially in a
05:53 - meeting to try to convince people that
05:56 - this website should go live sooner
05:59 - rather than later let me know thankfully
06:06 - most of the people that are meeting with
06:08 - I already know what their concerns are
06:10 - so I have a good idea of how I want to
06:12 - frame this there are some new people
06:15 - that I haven't even met yet so that's
06:19 - going to be kind of an unknown for me as
06:20 - a you know kind of what what their
06:24 - concerns are so let's see those are two
06:28 - big things I've just been pulling over
06:31 - more content and let's see
06:35 - I guess let's go back to the homepage so
06:41 - you can see the homepage has really like
06:44 - nothing nothing changed from what we had
06:48 - on it before I did I did change this a
06:54 - little bit as you see there's a I don't
06:56 - think we had this before but there's a
06:58 - change in the color that's kind of like
07:02 - another indicator of the hierarchy in
07:04 - the menu I'm sure I'm missing a few
07:09 - other things that happen oh we upgraded
07:11 - to an even newer version of next and
07:13 - that helps the the problem that we were
07:16 - to solve on you know a few days ago that
07:19 - helped to fix that problem so thank you
07:23 - to harsh it for getting on the next
07:26 - github repo and you're communicating
07:29 - with the maintainer --zz alright so this
07:37 - is going to be the first thing that the
07:39 - people see when I I present this what
07:42 - I'm thinking is that I'm gonna present
07:44 - the mobile view first so I'm gonna have
07:48 - on a projector my phone the screen on my
07:53 - phone to show what this looks like and
07:58 - then I'm also going to invite them to
08:00 - view it on their phones which is a
08:02 - little bit of a risk right because you
08:05 - know maybe they have a really old phone
08:06 - with an old outdated browser maybe it
08:08 - looks weird but I think it would be nice
08:11 - to have them actually be able to click
08:13 - around I'm gonna invite them to try to
08:15 - load the current website the really slow
08:17 - one on their phone try to click around
08:19 - on that just to get an idea of you know
08:23 - just really kind of the difference in
08:25 - the experience after that I will show
08:28 - them the desktop version if they want to
08:30 - see it but I want I really think that
08:34 - their audience of high school students
08:37 - is way more likely to view this on their
08:39 - phone based on data that I've seen
08:41 - unfortunately in Google Analytics the
08:43 - lowest age group I can that it'll show
08:46 - me is 18 to 24 year olds
08:49 - that's not really a good group that's
08:51 - that's not our target audience so that's
08:53 - kind of like eighteen year olds our
08:54 - target audience but we want eighteen in
08:57 - below so I can't get actual analytics
09:00 - data from our current site for that
09:03 - audience but regardless I don't think
09:08 - it'll be disputed that mobile is going
09:12 - to be the primary means so assuming this
09:16 - is the first thing people see one thing
09:18 - we definitely need an image that fits of
09:20 - the school we may or may not put that
09:23 - image in today I don't really want to
09:25 - spend time going through the photos that
09:27 - we have on the stream I'd rather do some
09:29 - code so we will be changing the image
09:34 - just so you know these buttons will
09:36 - probably remain the same for now what we
09:40 - really need to do is scroll through and
09:43 - just make sure what we got to put
09:51 - something right here you know this first
09:53 - section needs to grab attention so
09:58 - that's that's my big thing you know
10:01 - further down the page is becomes less
10:04 - and less important but probably anything
10:08 - like from here up we need to put
10:12 - something you know special in those
10:14 - those sections you know not only for the
10:17 - end user which will be this perspective
10:18 - students but for the meetings we need to
10:21 - grab you'll grab the attention so I'm
10:24 - thinking you know something like this
10:26 - with a nice impressive quote is fine
10:28 - potentially a video I think would be
10:30 - good but I know that some of the people
10:35 - that are going to be in these meetings
10:36 - are going to want to see a student
10:37 - profile so since we already brought in
10:40 - the student profile data well I already
10:41 - brought it in earlier today I think
10:43 - that's what we should do is really try
10:45 - to make a card or a section that
10:48 - highlights current students and I mean I
10:55 - don't know I guess maybe they found that
10:58 - the prospective students really like to
10:59 - see stories occurrence
11:01 - so for whatever reason that's what we're
11:03 - gonna show them so that's what we're
11:06 - gonna work on first we're gonna try to
11:07 - design and then develop as a react
11:09 - component some element which we'll
11:13 - showcase on a mobile screen an image a
11:16 - name and then a little bit of
11:19 - information about a student and we'll
11:21 - provide a link to a page that has more
11:24 - information maybe even a video so we
11:30 - have some things that we could work from
11:31 - right now like we were going to use this
11:34 - this doesn't look good on mobile so
11:38 - let's start out maybe we'll start from
11:43 - here at least we'll have something and
11:47 - then let's see how we can switch this
11:49 - around to make it look make it look
11:53 - better so now I think about it I don't
12:02 - want to use this first this looks better
12:04 - on desk desktop but I think something
12:08 - like this would work better on a mobile
12:13 - view all right let's start with that
12:17 - let me read through the live chat really
12:20 - quickly since I know there's it seems
12:23 - like there's a lot a lot in the live
12:27 - chat are ready hey everyone okay we I do
12:35 - have some good advice for the meetings
12:37 - here John Hanson says you have to push
12:38 - the ease speed booze and AHS don't go
12:41 - for the power under the hood Tech Talk
12:43 - that's good advice
12:45 - definitely I'm gonna have I'm gonna
12:47 - really try to remember that to not talk
12:49 - technology probably the only thing I'll
12:53 - get into that is just simply there's
12:55 - gonna be reliability and there's gonna
12:56 - be no downtime when we update I don't
13:01 - really need to get into why unless
13:02 - somebody asks see juggernaut says Pete
13:11 - speed is key 47% of customers expect a
13:13 - website to
13:14 - two seconds or less 40% of customers
13:17 - will abandon a website that takes more
13:19 - than three seconds to load that's
13:21 - awesome those are the kind of statistics
13:23 - that I really want to lead with
13:27 - juggernaut says every second that
13:29 - customers have to wait longer than three
13:31 - seconds reduces their satisfaction by
13:33 - 16% 79% of customers who are
13:37 - dissatisfied with website performance
13:39 - are less likely to repeat the purchase
13:43 - 44 percent of online shoppers tell
13:45 - friends and family about a bad online
13:47 - shopping experience cool juggernaut if
13:49 - you have a source for this like a link
13:52 - or something please send that to me
13:56 - because I like I want to use some of
13:59 - these statistics but in case somebody
14:01 - says where are you getting this info I'd
14:03 - like to be able to point them you know
14:04 - somewhere so if you do have that that'd
14:08 - be great otherwise I'll probably spend
14:10 - some time looking up sources myself just
14:13 - to have it ready all right let's start
14:19 - this timer let's let's start doing some
14:20 - code well some design slash slash code
14:24 - here right it kind of makes them
14:26 - together alright so we're gonna be on
14:30 - our index.html component let me start in
14:37 - grok so you all can what was it already
14:40 - started I guess I never shut off an
14:44 - grukk it's been on for days
14:45 - well not that anybody's really been on
14:48 - it okay so try this link for n grow up
14:51 - let me know if it doesn't work I assume
14:53 - it's still gonna work but I don't know
14:55 - that I've ever kept it on this long
14:56 - looks like it's working awesome okay
15:09 - where's our index page
15:21 - let's make this a lot bigger okay so for
15:28 - right now we're going to do everything
15:30 - in the index page well obviously we want
15:32 - to break this out into its own component
15:34 - at some point well let's go down and
15:39 - find a card let's see which one this one
15:48 - all right you should be the second card
15:50 - that we have here there we are okay so
15:56 - let's just work with this card and start
15:58 - to change it since we already have it
16:00 - here what I'd like to do is grab let's
16:11 - check out a student let's check out that
16:14 - student page that I showed you at the
16:16 - beginning so let's open a new tab low
16:23 - blows nice there we go the student
16:32 - profile so let's look at Noah Fisher
16:34 - I've never met Noah Fisher don't really
16:37 - know who Noah is but let's take Noah's
16:43 - stuff here so let's just get this is
16:50 - just a demo so I'm not gonna actually
16:52 - pull in real data yet it's it doesn't
16:55 - make sense for at this point which is
16:57 - really kind of like more of a design
17:00 - stage but I do want to grab the image
17:06 - URL okay we are getting right now I'm
17:10 - pulling the images from the current
17:12 - database so that's all going to change
17:16 - at some point for now it'll be okay
17:19 - so let's change this image to this first
17:26 - of all let's change the name we need a
17:29 - title right yeah we're gonna need that
17:33 - the title which would be the
17:34 - students name we can see right away does
17:38 - this image work right I don't care about
17:42 - the larger screen for now okay that
17:44 - image actually works for a card like
17:47 - this great okay so there's the image
17:52 - I think materiai has a title component
17:56 - built in let's grab that component I
18:00 - know I'm material I open somewhere on my
18:02 - screen there it is so we're using
18:08 - material UI's beta version if anyone
18:11 - wants to check out the docs as well it's
18:13 - material - UI - next comm to make this a
18:19 - little bigger for everyone also I'm
18:27 - gonna try and make this stream like kind
18:29 - of a shorter stream because I forgot to
18:32 - eat forget these lunch before the stream
18:35 - I was just working in like on a roll and
18:37 - so I know I'm gonna be getting super
18:40 - hungry soon I've been waking up really
18:45 - early so like 9:00 a.m. is like
18:48 - lunchtime for me now so I'm definitely
18:51 - past that that time all right where's
18:55 - our card here it is all right so let's
18:59 - check out oops yeah I want the demo so
19:04 - let's look okay this is kind of what I'm
19:06 - looking for a card that looks more like
19:08 - this let's just check out a few other
19:10 - examples yeah I think this one is the
19:16 - best fit for us here so let's see what
19:18 - else we're using all right so there's
19:22 - not really a special component they're
19:28 - just using typography headline okay that
19:31 - that works fine let's just grab let's
19:38 - grab all of this inside here
19:42 - and copy it over just so you know in
19:47 - case you haven't watched before I am
19:49 - definitely going to get to you all your
19:52 - questions in the live chat as soon as
19:54 - this Pomodoro session is over so if you
19:57 - if you are asking questions and I'm not
19:59 - answering back please be patient and I
20:02 - will answer all the questions in about
20:05 - 20 minutes or so car - okay let's save
20:19 - that so we get the auto formatting what
20:24 - you're not gonna auto format for me I
20:28 - was pretty sure I had it all set up I
20:31 - guess not
20:39 - you know what I don't think I copied
20:41 - everything that I call content actions
20:46 - actions
21:00 - all right the indentation just came over
21:03 - really weird I'm gonna leave it alone
21:04 - for now let's change this to be the name
21:09 - though uh how you suppose are saying so
21:14 - like if this year okay Noah Fisher and
21:22 - let's grab a little bit of the content
21:26 - that's here you know what let me let me
21:30 - grab some of the content that actually
21:31 - came through from the content management
21:33 - system so when I pulled this in from the
21:36 - database it had it already had some like
21:48 - an excerpt basically already there hmm
21:52 - looks like the excerpt has the name in
21:55 - it as well
21:55 - I don't like that this we may have to
21:59 - manually go in and change this but I'm
22:04 - gonna grab what was what was in that
22:07 - excerpt out of WordPress that's on my
22:10 - other screen and let's paste that into
22:12 - here just for testing we can worry about
22:14 - how we get that data in there later
22:17 - I really think after looking at some of
22:20 - this data I'm definitely gonna have to
22:21 - have somebody go through it manually and
22:25 - make some changes there's just not going
22:28 - to be any way around it there's some
22:30 - things that just I just can't work with
22:34 - all right fr unipi great and then for
22:39 - our buttons we're gonna make that's good
22:43 - learn more yeah let's just leave a learn
22:47 - more button in there for now
22:54 - all right let's see what we have yeah
23:00 - you know what I really don't like that
23:02 - this is showing up like that I want this
23:05 - to be more everything else I gotta
23:08 - really like about that headline h2 why's
23:13 - this let's check out why this h2 is
23:19 - looking like really not like an h2 at
23:26 - all all right sighs
23:39 - did we change I'm wondering if we
23:43 - changed something earlier I don't
23:50 - remember this
23:51 - I remember changing the size of this
24:00 - let's see what it's supposed to be in
24:02 - material you I was supposed to look like
24:07 - yeah it's supposed to look like this
24:10 - something's up I suspect maybe I just
24:13 - changed something so let's check out our
24:15 - code let me look at the live chat as
24:19 - well to see if you all caught the error
24:35 - okay it doesn't lose anything about it
24:38 - in there right now
24:52 - check up here
25:06 - hmm
25:35 - yeah I don't really see anything here
25:37 - that would be causing that the only
25:43 - place I'm even messing with font size is
25:45 - here but I don't think that's that would
25:54 - do anything there
26:17 - yeah
26:21 - all right well maybe I'll just switch
26:23 - this up let's just try some different H
26:27 - values see what changes if anything
26:33 - looks like nothing Wow so an h1 ends up
26:42 - with the same value
26:56 - let's see
26:59 - so I'm just checking the live chat
27:01 - quickly yeah I'm not sure what's
27:11 - happening with this we could certainly
27:13 - just put some inline styles in here to
27:16 - override this I suppose rather not do
27:23 - that if I don't have to let's see what
27:30 - we've done here
27:39 - here's nine
27:44 - oh yeah let's let's check out the code
27:47 - for this next one down typography type
27:50 - headline component that's exactly what
27:55 - we wanted to do right very type headline
27:58 - all right this is variant headline let's
28:01 - go with type I'm not sure what the deal
28:05 - was with the variant so if we switch it
28:08 - to type though maybe that'll work there
28:13 - we are
28:15 - that's interesting
28:21 - see I did have it does say variant
28:25 - headline here that's weird
28:30 - unless it's possible that this changed
28:34 - in a very new version of material UI and
28:37 - we haven't upgraded it yet I mean maybe
28:42 - maybe we need to upgrade and then change
28:46 - that we'll see I'm not interested in
28:49 - doing that right now though
28:51 - all right so let's see what you all
28:54 - think then
29:03 - so I don't know this doesn't seem very
29:08 - eye-catching to me right now I am gonna
29:13 - I'm gonna get on the end Rock server on
29:17 - my phone so that I can see what it looks
29:20 - like on a real device
29:30 - let's see
29:44 - i'ma send it to myself on slag
30:16 - okay actually that looks a lot better on
30:18 - a real phone
30:45 - all right so here's what if you all can
30:48 - look at this on your mobile devices I
30:50 - think that would actually be helpful you
30:54 - there's definitely a much different feel
30:57 - looking at this on a phone than I'm
30:59 - getting from here so I'm just a better
31:02 - way to do it really happy for an grukk
31:05 - right now although I know you can do
31:07 - this through dev tools as well but
31:12 - juggernut says good luck Jessie thanks
31:14 - for the streams oh you're welcome thanks
31:16 - for for all your advice you put in there
31:20 - I mean shake my tongue all right we're
31:24 - good it's been about eight minutes I'm
31:26 - gonna go back to the live chat and
31:28 - answer questions so if you just hang in
31:29 - for a little bit longer I'll get to them
31:37 - so here's a few things that I'm noticing
31:46 - this text here could definitely be
31:50 - smaller it's kind of overkill being this
31:53 - large so we should definitely decrease
31:56 - the size of that text at least for
31:59 - mobile and then for this do you all
32:04 - think it would be helpful to have some
32:07 - sort of indicator that this is a student
32:10 - profile right now it's just someone's
32:13 - name we don't really know anything about
32:15 - who this person is we have to read this
32:17 - to get some sense and even then this
32:21 - could be a like an alumni profile we
32:25 - don't really know so let's think I don't
32:34 - want to add too much onto here maybe
32:45 - yeah maybe we can add something maybe
32:50 - right at the top here maybe like student
32:54 - profile and small like small font all
32:57 - caps though in a different color
33:03 - so I'm thinking maybe something like we
33:06 - did for C eyes catechetical Institute's
33:12 - [Music]
33:15 - their resource cards so if you all see
33:23 - that how we have you know obviously this
33:26 - is the text we want people to see but
33:28 - you can see here in a different color
33:32 - you know just like I said all caps it
33:37 - tells us what it is what category that
33:41 - is let me know what you think about it
33:46 - I'm gonna try to implement this then I
33:49 - can't unfortunately I can't just take
33:51 - what we did here because we used a
33:52 - different system for this a different UI
33:54 - system we use materialized CSS
33:58 - it would be kind of nice if I could just
34:00 - copy it over you know we did use it in
34:07 - our bulletin project let's go to github
34:14 - the react version of the bulletin I
34:17 - believe did the same thing so let's
34:20 - check it out
34:21 - it should be under components and
34:25 - attachments a little post preview I
34:29 - think that's it so the post preview the
34:38 - card view yeah here's our card view and
34:45 - what did we do we are using material UI
34:47 - ear typography caption okay so we use
34:53 - typography caption and we did have some
34:56 - styles we will pull over the styles as
34:59 - well but see this is the benefit I think
35:02 - I've talked about this before but the
35:04 - benefit of trying to use a system and
35:06 - stick with the system is stuff like this
35:08 - to where we have these use cases that
35:12 - are similar enough that we can just go
35:15 - back to a previous project pull the code
35:17 - and really get a jumpstart on what we're
35:20 - doing all right so we're gonna copy this
35:23 - first and then I'll bring the Styles
35:24 - over oops wrong way so right here and
35:30 - we're gonna change this for now we're
35:34 - gonna say zoom profile and then we're
35:41 - gonna pull over this category color
35:43 - class we'll probably change the name of
35:46 - it once we pull it over and now category
35:49 - category actually works here that makes
35:52 - sense area category color
36:09 - I don't know where any the other the
36:12 - other stuff is coming from it seems like
36:19 - this we're doing some other stuff too
36:21 - can I wear your color
36:23 - oh we were doing category to uppercase
36:27 - we yeah we can definitely change that
36:30 - with with CSS alright so we'll change it
36:35 - a little bit let's see
36:39 - oops keep going the wrong way nice let's
36:43 - change this to category and then up here
36:49 - we'll add it in this category we're
36:57 - obviously gonna change the color
36:59 - we'll keep it like this for now though
37:00 - and then let's go what is a text there's
37:11 - a text transform let's check this out I
37:21 - can't remember what the very value is
37:24 - we'll see if this works
37:31 - yeah that worked okay cool so it is text
37:34 - transform uppercase so here we go we
37:37 - have it here let me check on a phone
37:40 - before I smell swith the size even on my
37:46 - phone it's still a little small so I
37:48 - don't want it to be too large but that's
37:50 - that's definitely too small so let's
37:52 - let's increase the font size slightly
37:55 - see what we're working with right now in
37:59 - terms of font size computer 12 pixels
38:02 - yeah 12 is no good let's make it at
38:05 - least 14 you know I really don't like
38:11 - going much lower than like 18 or 16
38:14 - let's just change it right here and see
38:16 - let's see about 16 pixels see what that
38:20 - does that's too big we're gonna have to
38:28 - go to 14 the only other option is if we
38:31 - made this title a bit bigger but I
38:33 - really don't want to alright so let's
38:36 - try 14 is the font size and see how that
38:38 - looks on a phone as well obviously it
38:40 - doesn't come through and dev tools we'll
38:42 - have to add it to the code and save that
38:45 - to see what it looks like font size and
38:53 - got a comma and what do we say 14 yeah
39:04 - and I definitely yeah I think I wanted
39:10 - different color as well
39:12 - student profile let me refresh okay so
39:18 - that should be coming true now on my
39:20 - phone too
39:30 - to do anything
39:37 - yeah I did okay cool all right I think
39:43 - that's that's not bad I don't know how
39:46 - many you can see it on your phone as
39:48 - well but I like that I like that I think
39:56 - the the font for the body of it could be
40:00 - a little bit better and then we could
40:02 - potentially put this in quotes so that
40:05 - it's more obvious that this is Noah
40:07 - Fisher talking
40:16 - okay alright so my timer went off let's
40:20 - take a short five-minute break i'ma go
40:21 - to a live chat answer any questions that
40:25 - you all have so I'm gonna scroll up and
40:26 - start up near the top so the older
40:28 - questions first
40:38 - let's see there was some advice for kind
40:42 - of that circle view that I had so I
40:45 - don't think we're gonna go with that and
40:46 - not that we won't use it somewhere else
40:48 - but just for this particular case I
40:50 - think I'm gonna go with this on a
40:53 - desktop view I may actually go with that
40:56 - circle view that that we had so I'm
41:01 - talking about this I think it it works a
41:06 - lot better when it's larger so we may
41:11 - use that
41:37 - nikki is asking about the HTTP sites
41:48 - being marked is unsafe so Google
41:50 - announced that chrome is going to start
41:52 - marking sites unsafe that have HTTP
41:56 - instead of HTTP so iniki's asking does
42:01 - that mean that images also have to be
42:04 - HTTPS like everything I believe so
42:08 - so right now I think what happens is if
42:10 - you're loading insecure assets on to a
42:14 - site that's supposed to be HTTPS it
42:18 - won't display like the full HTTPS
42:22 - there'll be some sort of warning icon
42:24 - for that so well it looks like John
42:29 - Hanson already answered but yeah you
42:30 - need to make sure all your assets are
42:33 - HTTPS
42:43 - blake ass if anyone's checked out react
42:46 - ql you know what i read a little bit
42:49 - about it but i haven't tried it yet
42:51 - probably for this project since we're so
42:53 - far along I'm gonna stick with Apollo
42:57 - for the graph QL stuff but I'm open to
43:01 - trying it out on other projects quanti
43:07 - Xie asks if this is react yeah
43:09 - definitely we're using react right now
43:12 - so we're doing more of like the design
43:16 - stuff so not getting heavily into react
43:18 - components but we are working in react
43:21 - components so you know this is inside a
43:23 - react component we're using you know
43:25 - styles as a JavaScript object which is
43:29 - one way to do styles and react so
43:33 - potentially this may be helpful if
43:36 - you're learning react
43:43 - let's see
43:49 - I jog you're not saying I don't know
43:51 - which what technology univer University
43:53 - uses now but adopting two open standards
43:56 - will allow University to share data
44:02 - between services and systems more easily
44:04 - avoid getting locked into specific piece
44:07 - of technology or supplier reuse software
44:09 - components built by others including
44:11 - open source components reduce overall
44:13 - cost of your digital service change your
44:15 - services design every time we're easily
44:17 - yeah okay so that's definitely the the
44:21 - reason one of the reasons behind the
44:23 - switch is exactly that I don't want us
44:26 - to get locked in like we're we're
44:28 - currently have been locked into a system
44:30 - we're moving everything to open source
44:34 - stuff and we're trying to use things
44:39 - that like okay so let me tou is open
44:42 - source we're using react which is used
44:45 - everywhere our content management system
44:49 - is WordPress but since we're pulling the
44:51 - data in with graph QL we could grab data
44:55 - from wherever we're not really locked
44:56 - into that
45:08 - also says looks good on the phone
45:10 - checking on an s8 awesome alright Nicky
45:20 - says rename the type property to variant
45:22 - and material UI update beta 32 so you
45:25 - are okay
45:25 - so Nicky is it was confirming that it is
45:30 - in the latest version of material UI
45:33 - they did change that type property to
45:36 - variant so where we were
45:38 - I had this wasn't working for us that's
45:42 - because I copied this from the latest
45:43 - documentation and type is now variant so
45:47 - whenever we do update to that we'll just
45:49 - have to keep that in mind and go through
45:50 - and change every instance of type to
45:52 - variant assuming that there's no
45:54 - backwards compatibility built in also
46:01 - says maybe below the name as well yeah
46:04 - we could do it below the name we should
46:07 - maybe think about that right now
46:10 - do you all think it would be better to
46:12 - have student profile above or below the
46:15 - name right now I I kind of would rather
46:18 - have it above the name but if enough of
46:23 - you disagree I can try to put it below
46:27 - it wouldn't be that big of a deal just
46:30 - to try it out let's see I'm almost to
46:37 - the bottom of the live chat so I'm going
46:39 - to glance quickly to see if there's
46:40 - anything I should address right now okay
46:47 - looks like you Yoshi knows if I'm
46:54 - pronouncing it wrong please let me know
46:55 - but I know she knows says above the name
46:58 - looks nice to be honest awesome I mean
47:01 - we'll probably just stick with that
47:05 - alright one last question before we
47:08 - start I arose in please let me know if
47:12 - that's if I'm pronouncing that wrong
47:15 - says what's the best IDE I use adamant
47:19 - is is that meaning visual studio cut
47:22 - better than these I use Adam and visual
47:25 - studio code I like them both
47:27 - visual studio code does seem to be a
47:29 - little bit faster but if you have a good
47:31 - computer it really doesn't make a
47:33 - difference I have not used sublime but
47:37 - I've heard it's good a juggernaut also
47:42 - did a adopting open standards in modern
47:45 - tech also attract future students
47:46 - exactly exactly a juggernaut that's you
47:51 - you definitely get like exactly what
47:54 - like I've been trying to do here
47:57 - gradually you know over over the last
48:00 - two years that's kind of been my you
48:03 - know trying to just update and move
48:05 - things forward and this is kind of like
48:07 - the pinnacle of that and finally getting
48:09 - the main website off of you know this
48:12 - old stuff so hopefully I can convince
48:16 - everyone that I need to convince that
48:19 - that is the way to go and we can get
48:20 - this up and running soon someone in a
48:23 - meeting like that I wasn't in threw out
48:25 - a date of July June first I think of
48:29 - June first there's no way we need till
48:33 - June first to finish this site and I'm
48:35 - afraid if we did take till June first
48:37 - then everybody in the university would
48:38 - want to have their saying and how things
48:41 - go and we would just get swamped with
48:42 - all these competing ideas but I'm all
48:48 - for collaboration on that but sometimes
48:50 - you can have too many people you know
48:53 - putting their input in and then we'd end
48:54 - up with a very cluttered kind of mess of
48:58 - a site and that's not what we want all
49:00 - right let's go
49:02 - start our Pomodoro clock and all right
49:09 - let's see okay I did want to try to make
49:12 - this see how big we can make this while
49:15 - it still looks reasonable and we want to
49:17 - decrease and see how small we can make
49:19 - this that it would still stand out all
49:24 - right so let's check
49:26 - inspect this right now and I'm gonna see
49:29 - what they have 14 oh yeah I'd really
49:32 - rather that be 16 pixels so let's see
49:35 - what 16 looks like on here first oh yeah
49:46 - for sure this I think 16 looks a lot
49:50 - better let's try putting this in and
49:54 - then on the phone let's see so component
49:58 - Peas I think how I can do this what's
50:06 - the best way to do this would be
50:19 - for now I'm just gonna do it like this
50:21 - and this will show a different way to do
50:25 - styles and react sty and let's go with
50:37 - whoops I did not need this font size
50:45 - yeah 16 right 16 pixels okay so if you
50:52 - want to do inline styles what did I mess
50:57 - that up it's possible that I just messed
51:02 - that up
51:09 - I think it was just a style thing okay
51:11 - so you can do inline styles like this
51:13 - you need to use curly brackets to drop
51:16 - in the JavaScript mode and then more
51:18 - curly brackets to make this a JavaScript
51:20 - object then you know just like we did up
51:24 - at the top we're putting styles in a
51:26 - JavaScript object so we use camel case
51:32 - for our keys and then our values for the
51:36 - most part you want to put your values in
51:37 - quotes if it's just simply a numerical
51:40 - value with no units you don't have to
51:42 - put it in quotes alright let's see how
51:44 - that looks great and that is coming
51:47 - through like this I don't know that I
51:49 - would want to leave this probably what I
51:53 - want to do is maybe find some solution
51:55 - where every component that has PE here
51:59 - for under type with the typography
52:03 - component would then automatically be
52:05 - minimum of 16 pixels I don't really want
52:09 - to figure out how to do that right now
52:10 - with material UI but that's probably a
52:13 - better solution that would just take
52:15 - place across the board let's see oh I
52:24 - want to look at it on a phone as opposed
52:27 - miss Andrew there's one more step oh
52:29 - yeah I yeah that is I don't know if you
52:33 - all can see that on your phones if you
52:34 - can that's just so much more readable I
52:38 - like that I really like that I want to
52:42 - see what it looks like in those quotes
52:43 - as well so let's do it like that I
52:47 - wonder for a second I thought what if we
52:52 - do a blockquote right what about how
52:57 - would that look maybe we can take a look
53:02 - at that
53:08 - yeah the quotes are okay I'm looking at
53:11 - on my phone let me go over maybe there
53:14 - is some other way to format this that
53:18 - might look nicer but for now this I
53:19 - think is acceptable let's adjust the
53:24 - font size here so let's go with maybe 20
53:35 - pixels whoa way too small all right
53:41 - let's see 3030 is actually not that bad
53:59 - yeah let's see what I'm using here for
54:02 - this
54:04 - typography display - yeah let's just try
54:11 - to go with a different type here display
54:13 - three maybe I'm not sure if there is a
54:16 - display three but we'll try it out well
54:21 - let's take this off - whoa displace
54:24 - still too big display for okay as you go
54:34 - up it gets bigger
54:35 - let's try display one I was thinking
54:39 - they were like age tags
54:40 - okay all right display one is much more
54:43 - reasonable let's just go with that
54:45 - those will set it to display one let's
54:48 - check it all these different display
54:51 - values they're built in the material UI
54:53 - so if you're not familiar with that
54:55 - that's what we're doing yeah that's
54:57 - that's much more reasonable and that
55:01 - reduces the amount of scrolling
55:03 - significantly great that's wonderful
55:24 - cool all right now let's go we're gonna
55:31 - try Nikki says plus one for trying
55:34 - blockquote okay let's do that for sure
55:36 - let's try block quote I want to see I'm
55:39 - assuming that there's a block quote no
55:53 - a scooter that typography component
56:00 - we go to the API and check out the props
56:05 - here we display four three two one
56:10 - headline titles subheading body one body
56:13 - two caption button maybe they don't have
56:22 - all right so based on my three seconds I
56:26 - spent searching it doesn't look like
56:27 - there's a blockquote
56:29 - component or option here so let's just
56:31 - use the block quote element you know
56:34 - straight up just the HTML element and
56:36 - see how that looks
56:38 - oh yeah okay so I'm going to do is copy
56:45 - this and let's just put it over over
56:54 - here this is kind of just my place just
56:56 - throw stuff if I want to save it for
56:59 - later and I keep forgetting to implement
57:03 - the search well that's what this is up
57:05 - here what maybe we'll do that on Monday
57:07 - I think it would be cool to have the
57:09 - search function available because that
57:11 - that's the search works as you're typing
57:16 - you automatically get results and that
57:19 - seems to impress people so I'd like to
57:22 - have the search function working as well
57:23 - for our demos alright so let's take this
57:27 - and say quote
57:39 - chuckle die
57:41 - let's see what happens okay so when we
57:50 - make that a blockquote
57:53 - yeah I'm not I don't think that really
57:59 - adds much it's seems maybe like material
58:06 - I doesn't have a blockquote
58:11 - kind of built in let's see what I'm
58:16 - saying
58:18 - Brooke says just give it a left border
58:21 - that's like gray I guess
58:33 - before it was better okay yeah let's
58:36 - switch it back actually I can just I
58:39 - don't need to copy that over we'll
58:46 - switch it back and then maybe we could
58:49 - add let's add that border so you see
58:55 - which all right yeah let's grab that P
58:59 - let's do a border left and we'll go two
59:07 - pixels two pickles might be too small we
59:11 - might have to go three Bobble the two
59:13 - pixels solid and let's go or G be a zero
59:21 - zero zero and goes zero point five four
59:28 - and that should give us a nice gray mmm
59:33 - yeah it's too thin and the gray seems
59:35 - too dark
59:36 - so let's bump this down and go maybe
59:41 - 14mm twenty-four all right 24 and then
59:46 - let's jump up I think four pixels might
59:48 - be better yeah I like four pixels and
59:51 - then let's give this some padding
59:56 - padding left of eight pixels wonderful
60:03 - all right what do you all think of that
60:07 - so yeah so we've given a four pixel
60:11 - border with a pixel padding the padding
60:14 - goes between the border and the content
60:17 - if we went margarine it would be on this
60:19 - side so that's why we went with padding
60:21 - instead let me let me put that in the
60:30 - code and then you all can see that on
60:32 - your screens or on your phones
60:40 - let's make this a class now so let's
60:43 - make a blockquote
60:45 - class and classname classes let's just
60:57 - call it quote I don't want to confuse it
61:01 - with the element blockquote so we're
61:03 - just gonna call it quote we can take
61:05 - this out of here because we'll add this
61:06 - in as part of the quote class quotes and
61:19 - we'll just paste that in and then we'll
61:22 - change it up font size 16 pixels
61:41 - we're trying we need to camelcase
61:43 - everything and put the proper wou
61:51 - quotation marks get rid of the
61:54 - semicolons and now this should work
61:58 - let's go back here and great looks good
62:07 - refresh great alright there we are I'm
62:11 - gonna check this out on my phone I Nikki
62:20 - that was a great idea I think I really
62:25 - that adds something that looks nice it's
62:33 - just a little thing but I don't know it
62:35 - makes a difference let me know what you
62:37 - all think I don't want things to be too
62:41 - busy but really I mean this is gonna
62:43 - this is really kind of a clean
62:45 - minimalist site so I'm not worried yet
62:49 - that it's getting busy but I I like it
62:53 - I'm hoping other opinions though see
62:57 - looks like so far so far everyone likes
63:01 - it awesome Nikki again great idea on
63:04 - that
63:15 - cool alright cool and I did go with that
63:18 - RG oops I just realized I had my phone
63:23 - right next to the mic so I'm sorry if
63:25 - there was any distortion in the audio
63:27 - huh that sometimes happens when I have
63:31 - my phone too close anyway so say I go
63:35 - with that rgba because especially when
63:37 - I'm trying to do black I usually don't
63:40 - use it for other colors very often but
63:42 - for black it's so nice to be able to
63:44 - just you know on a scale of 0 to 1 being
63:49 - able to adjust the you make different
63:52 - shades of gray essentially you know by
63:55 - adjusting that is just really nice and
64:00 - then you know there are certain values
64:01 - that I use consistently this so like
64:03 - usually for gray text for alt text I
64:06 - don't use regular black I use you know 0
64:09 - 0 0.87 and then for text that I'm using
64:16 - in a form like the little hint text you
64:21 - put in there and in like a form element
64:23 - like an input that's iu 0 0 0 point 5 4
64:29 - so those values are always consistent
64:31 - throughout all the sites that I do for
64:34 - the university so there's there's some
64:36 - consistency and then you know for little
64:39 - elements like that obviously we adjust
64:43 - you know but for at least for the font
64:45 - it's very consistent alright great
64:49 - the only thing we didn't really do
64:51 - anything about was this learn more but
64:57 - you know what I like that it's coming up
65:00 - with the University Green already which
65:03 - which i think is fun that looks good and
65:07 - so on I'm okay with that
65:15 - all right let me check my timer alright
65:18 - about eight minutes so at this point
65:21 - what would be nice to do would be to
65:24 - pull this out into its own component
65:28 - potentially add in some some options
65:31 - right so we would want to have the
65:35 - option to change this type here this
65:39 - category right so that we could use it
65:42 - with multiple things so maybe we want to
65:45 - use this as a faculty profile or an
65:47 - alumni profile this component could
65:49 - definitely work for all of those we
65:54 - could also have options potentially for
66:01 - more buttons and we definitely want this
66:04 - button to be a link as well so we want
66:06 - this we wouldn't leave it just like this
66:07 - we would want to put a link component in
66:09 - here yeah for sure those would be
66:17 - options and then we could just fill in
66:22 - the data you know as we pull it in from
66:27 - from WordPress we had another suggestion
66:33 - to try out okay so nikki says maybe we
66:38 - can remove the quotes and Ahmed says we
66:41 - could try italic let's try it out right
66:44 - I think I don't think I have time to
66:45 - really you know take on a whole nother
66:47 - component before my my timer runs out
66:50 - but I we do have some time to try out
66:52 - some of these piece ideas what do you
66:57 - all think about the idea to take out the
67:00 - quotation marks would it still be
67:02 - obvious that this is a quote if we take
67:05 - them out now that we have this let me
67:09 - know what you all think because I'm
67:12 - definitely open to taking them out I
67:13 - don't think they really looked at great
67:18 - we could maybe add something a little
67:21 - bit more stylish like an icon to denote
67:29 - I'm thinking like maybe like a larger
67:31 - you know quotation mark I don't know
67:34 - like I said I don't want this to get too
67:36 - busy all right let's try there's a
67:45 - fright Alex there's a text-decoration
67:54 - thought oh no it's not is it
68:05 - all right John says take out the quotes
68:09 - yo she notices italics might fit and
68:14 - make the marks look better if we do keep
68:17 - the clothes all font-style it's uh I'm
68:20 - sorry I'll met you you typed it right
68:21 - there I don't know what I was thinking
68:24 - filling font style all right oh let's
68:33 - just check that out sorry let me get
68:37 - this down to one area
68:44 - all right what do you all think
68:51 - oops I didn't put it in there let me put
68:54 - it in so I can see it and we can all see
68:57 - it on our our devices so class quote
69:31 - all right I'm gonna give you all a
69:33 - chance to look at it and let me know
69:35 - what you think before I say what I think
69:38 - about it
70:03 - I'm gonna check quickly about
70:39 - I wonder what's the is there any
70:47 - anything within material design that
70:49 - designates when italics should be used I
70:53 - don't remember seeing anything in the
70:55 - documentation I'm scrolling through the
70:58 - typography section right now seeing
71:07 - anything
71:14 - hmm
71:23 - all right so here's my impression I
71:26 - think it looks nice it makes it even
71:28 - more obvious that it's a quote but it
71:32 - makes it less readable so I think we
71:36 - have a trade-off here
71:40 - do we want to sacrifice some readability
71:44 - or
71:54 - or have it look I don't know I'm a
71:57 - little bit I'm torn between this let's
72:04 - let's do this and you check my time oops
72:15 - alright only have a minute left let's go
72:19 - down here
73:04 - alright so I'm gonna remove italic from
73:07 - here and I just added an inline so we
73:13 - should be able to see both both versions
73:18 - did it not work I did something wrong
73:41 - oops I put it on the wrong wrong thing
73:58 - okay now we should be able to see him
74:01 - together and on different devices
74:22 - I can't decide I'm gonna leave both my
74:24 - timer just went up so I'm gonna leave
74:26 - both of them one for now and I think
74:29 - I'll probably even commit these to
74:31 - github like that as well we can worry
74:35 - about refactoring into another component
74:36 - sometime
74:37 - some other time or if anybody really
74:39 - wants to make a pull request you know
74:42 - doing that then that's that would be
74:45 - great as well but maybe I'll show my
74:50 - boss or show it to some people around
74:52 - here too and get their input hmm sorry
74:59 - sorry about the yawning okay I'm gonna
75:06 - go back to the live chat go through and
75:09 - finish up if any questions that I missed
75:11 - from from the last break and then I'll
75:13 - wrap things up here
75:30 - on Hill says why not work with pixels
75:33 - and why work with pixels and not
75:36 - percentage it would be better for
75:37 - Responsive actually yeah I would like to
75:41 - have the responsive text so basically
75:44 - what I want is a minimum that the text
75:48 - will never go below which is going to be
75:50 - like 16 pixels and then it could get
75:54 - larger from there so I'm open to doing
75:59 - that I mean for now which just was
76:01 - easier for me to use pixels and I mean I
76:04 - pretty much think in pixels I'm used to
76:06 - using pixels so I know in my head like
76:10 - here's how this will look with the other
76:11 - units that I could potentially use I I
76:15 - just can't see in my head what that's
76:17 - gonna look like so when I'm doing things
76:20 - like this I'm always in pixels but I'm
76:23 - open to doing other things you know when
76:25 - it's time to actually you make the final
76:27 - version of this
76:49 - also says what if you put the name below
76:52 - the text on the right side and remove
76:54 - the italic text all right so it would
76:58 - look more like like the citation for the
77:03 - quote I think about that I'm not gonna
77:09 - try it right now because you know at a
77:13 - time my time I ran up but I'll keep that
77:17 - in mind is an alternative what I'll
77:19 - probably do is show these to my boss too
77:21 - and if it looks like he's not that
77:24 - excited about this design I'll bring
77:27 - that up as an alternative to
77:44 - okay all right I see y'all were talking
77:49 - more about putting it below yeah yeah I
77:59 - think about that anything
78:10 - yeah I'm wondering just from like a
78:14 - marketing standpoint would it if you put
78:20 - the quote with a small name below it
78:22 - then the quote itself is highlighted and
78:25 - the name is in a secondary place if you
78:28 - put the name at the top with the quote
78:30 - underneath in the name is higher up I
78:32 - think like if we want the student to
78:37 - identify with hey this is another
78:39 - student like a real person to say
78:41 - student profile and then a name makes
78:43 - that immediate connection and then they
78:45 - could read more if we want them just
78:48 - though to connect more with what the
78:50 - student is saying and just know like hey
78:53 - this is a student then the other way
78:57 - around would work better I like to think
79:05 - about that because I mean I could see if
79:08 - the quote was really good or or profound
79:12 - you definitely want to highlight the
79:13 - quote I don't know that that's
79:15 - necessarily the case with all these
79:17 - quotes maybe also the quote is is kind
79:21 - of like large I'm gonna think about it
79:30 - I do agree that putting the name below
79:34 - would definitely make it more evident
79:38 - right away that it is a quote
79:46 - hmm
79:52 - this would be a really good thing to do
79:54 - for a be testing I potentially have
79:58 - multiple versions of the homepage where
80:00 - we have one with this style and and
80:02 - another card with the style with the
80:04 - name below and then we measure how many
80:09 - people click on that learn more button
80:18 - one that says with the name below it
80:20 - would make it like a testimonial
80:22 - actually you're you're right really what
80:25 - we're doing here is a testimonial maybe
80:28 - we should look at some common design
80:30 - patterns for testimonials and see if we
80:33 - can get some ideas how this is it like I
80:36 - could we could spend so much time on
80:38 - this one component really at some point
80:43 - I have to make a decision and say okay
80:45 - we have to move on
80:47 - Sean saying more graphical quotation
80:49 - marks yeah I think I could be a good
80:51 - idea
80:51 - all right I'm gonna think about these
80:59 - ideas if anybody would like to mess with
81:02 - this component and you know just to try
81:06 - some things out feel free if you do want
81:09 - to make a pull request for something
81:11 - like this I suggest not removing these
81:14 - but just adding another one like add a
81:16 - third one with the alternate design so
81:19 - that we could compare you know one after
81:23 - another I'm also gonna have to think
81:26 - about given the limited time I have
81:29 - before I have to present this is it
81:31 - worth it for me to worry about this like
81:33 - longer term yeah for sure I think so and
81:36 - I think it might be worth it to do the
81:37 - a/b testing but before my presentation
81:39 - would it be worth it for me to worry
81:41 - about this I don't know that I have time
81:43 - so I guess I'm gonna leave it at that
81:46 - point for now but I really do appreciate
81:50 - all the input because I don't think I
81:52 - would have thought about those things on
81:54 - my own
81:58 - okay
82:02 - yeah and I this is going to be really
82:05 - prominent I think this type of component
82:07 - will be prominent it will be important I
82:09 - definitely want to measure clicks on
82:11 - this this is a really good candidate for
82:14 - a be testing yeah so I'm going to go
82:19 - with that I think at some point probably
82:21 - not before we I do the presentation but
82:24 - potentially before or like shortly after
82:26 - we launch I think I want to do another
82:28 - version of this taking into account your
82:30 - suggestions and then test the impact
82:33 - that's really the only way to know which
82:36 - one is really gonna resonate with
82:37 - prospective students who more alright
82:42 - cool
82:43 - let me commit this right now so I don't
82:46 - forget and then you all can have access
82:50 - to everything that we've done in the
82:52 - repo so let's do it get status see what
82:56 - we've done great that's exactly what we
82:59 - modified so no surprises there we do it
83:01 - get add and then we'll do a yarn CM this
83:06 - is something like custom that we have on
83:08 - this project that it walks you through
83:09 - the pattern of making a good commit
83:11 - message so it's going to ask us if what
83:15 - this is a new feature yeah this is a new
83:18 - feature let's say let's see create
83:25 - create component for student profile
83:32 - card great
83:40 - actually that's kind of misleading I'm
83:42 - gonna leave it there but we didn't
83:43 - really make a separate component because
83:44 - we didn't pull it out yet into its own
83:46 - file but I'm not gonna go back and
83:50 - change it right now we did not break
83:52 - anything and we didn't have any issues
83:54 - open so all our tests are gonna run our
83:56 - linting is gonna run I don't know what
83:58 - did we do HTML entities must be escaped
84:03 - where is the set
84:12 - oh it doesn't like the quote alright
84:14 - let's just take the quotes out for now
84:15 - then I'm okay with that
84:24 - well I can change my message now all
84:30 - right
84:46 - creates even profile card all right
84:48 - that's more accurate because we didn't
84:50 - turn into a component just yet
84:52 - there we go should pass this time
85:00 - looks like Nikki wasn't a fan of the
85:02 - quotation works anyway so now they're
85:04 - gone
85:04 - Noble and savage says forget what hi
85:08 - Jesse tis Savage banana soup hey how's
85:12 - it going thanks for joining us
85:14 - all right cool to get was origin
85:18 - Oh between last stream and now I also
85:21 - did merge that next five branch with
85:24 - masters so after I upgraded it again and
85:27 - checked everything out everything was
85:29 - working fine so I thought okay let's
85:31 - just merge it back and now if you see
85:33 - any weird things happening please let me
85:34 - know but I think we'll be okay with it
85:36 - for now okay Nikki says you can do yarn
85:42 - cm retry to commit the exact same thing
85:46 - messages and all it's better yeah yeah
85:49 - that's really helpful because a few
85:51 - times that's happened to me and I've had
85:53 - to type it in again and it's really
85:54 - frustrating especially if you get errors
85:58 - like three times in a row which has
86:01 - happened so yeah I'm definitely gonna
86:04 - try my best to remember that and use it
86:07 - so that is helpful yeah in this case I
86:09 - wanted to change the commit message
86:12 - anyway but thank you
86:15 - Thank You Nikki alright so I think I've
86:18 - gotten through everything and so I'm
86:20 - gonna finish things up here and go get
86:22 - something to eat thank you so much for
86:24 - all your help
86:25 - I think we made a really nice component
86:27 - today I think it looks great
86:29 - and then we also have some ideas for
86:31 - some variations on this component as
86:34 - well which is also awesome at the very
86:37 - least it might not be a bad idea to use
86:39 - different variations of the same
86:41 - component on the page at the same time
86:43 - just to kind of mix it up for people
86:47 - yeah
86:49 - yeah I think that would be good now that
86:52 - I think about it we probably could get
86:55 - some quotes from some more like famous
86:57 - people like since this is a Catholic
86:59 - school like we could probably get some
87:02 - quotes from some bishops and stuff that
87:05 - might be impressive to prospective
87:07 - students or their parents and we could
87:10 - use this for that as well so I could see
87:13 - this component as being very useful for
87:15 - a variety of you know different pieces
87:18 - of content all right well it's Friday
87:25 - have a wonderful weekend I'll see you
87:28 - all on Monday

Cleaned transcript:

everyone welcome to live coding with Jessie it's been a few days it's been kind of crazy we had a big ice storm here and everything was covered and I don't know like this much ice it was wild so the offices were closed yesterday I had like unexpected things going on and meetings getting moved around and so I just didn't really have like I wasn't confident that I would have enough time to stream so today I'm gonna catch you up with some of the things that I've been doing some pool requests and then we're gonna work a little bit on the layout for the homepage so to understand why I'm doing this let me tell you what's what's been happening so I all right let me how to try to start from the beginning here okay so some people higher up in the university that I work for have decided that they don't want the website to go live by the end of this month which is what we were shooting for we'll see if that stands from from what I understand I wasn't involved in any of these meetings but from what I understand I think that there's a misunderstanding here about with this website kind of redesigned and development is involving and I think there's a fear that it's going to be such a big change that prospective students are going to be confused so now I'm gonna have meetings with different groups of people within the university some different people you know higher up in the university and I'm gonna demo this website to them show them what we're doing explain it my hope is that after people see how far along this is and and what we're actually doing then they'll be okay with us launching now if we have to push back the launch date we have to but it's going to cost you know the university some extra money to renew the contract for the old websites content management system so I'd rather not push it back if it's unnecessary if the reason we push it back is simply because you know there's a misunderstanding then that's even if it's not that much money it's still a waste you know it's a waste of money so I'm gonna do what I can in terms of the meetings but that changes the plan a little bit for how we we develop this so the plan right now is get the homepage looking as good as possible and as functional as possible right away like within the next few days well today and then the next few days of next week's like Monday Tuesday Wednesday I have to present it to the first group on Thursday so I just leaves us a few days and then also we want to get as many interior pages as we can looking good so I can demo things so here's what I've been doing to make that happen let me switch over so I can show you on my screen so we have this is kind of small what if I can I can't really zoom in let me take this out of the mobile view so that I can just make it bigger of course we're still doing kind of a mobile first development but so this is one of the things that I've added I know that one of the people who is really concerned probably the main person that is really concerned about the launch date wants to delay it it's also probably going to be looking for this type of thing these student profiles so I brought over some student profiles and I made sure that the images comes and that some videos come through so this is really basic we're gonna have to do some styling on on this kind of thing I don't like that look but overall it came through it came through okay I'll show you what I had I had to do some stuff to get these to come through all right now I'll show you more about that but then also these links on the side I've been adding in the URLs so these will now actually link to the right places the assuming that we have the correct data so let me see alright cool so that one did work these are links and they also use the next link prefetch so that next has a link component built in and then we can add prefetch so that should make the transition between pages extra fast that's another feature I want to really show off is how fast this website is compared to the old one it's going to be fast compared to any website but especially compared to the old one I think that's a huge selling point and maybe I'm going to bring in some statistics on the likely number of prospective students that are actually leaving our current site before it even loads because the load times are so terrible and how many more students we would have if we switch the site over so if anyone has any other ideas of things that I could bring up potentially in a meeting to try to convince people that this website should go live sooner rather than later let me know thankfully most of the people that are meeting with I already know what their concerns are so I have a good idea of how I want to frame this there are some new people that I haven't even met yet so that's going to be kind of an unknown for me as a you know kind of what what their concerns are so let's see those are two big things I've just been pulling over more content and let's see I guess let's go back to the homepage so you can see the homepage has really like nothing nothing changed from what we had on it before I did I did change this a little bit as you see there's a I don't think we had this before but there's a change in the color that's kind of like another indicator of the hierarchy in the menu I'm sure I'm missing a few other things that happen oh we upgraded to an even newer version of next and that helps the the problem that we were to solve on you know a few days ago that helped to fix that problem so thank you to harsh it for getting on the next github repo and you're communicating with the maintainer zz alright so this is going to be the first thing that the people see when I I present this what I'm thinking is that I'm gonna present the mobile view first so I'm gonna have on a projector my phone the screen on my phone to show what this looks like and then I'm also going to invite them to view it on their phones which is a little bit of a risk right because you know maybe they have a really old phone with an old outdated browser maybe it looks weird but I think it would be nice to have them actually be able to click around I'm gonna invite them to try to load the current website the really slow one on their phone try to click around on that just to get an idea of you know just really kind of the difference in the experience after that I will show them the desktop version if they want to see it but I want I really think that their audience of high school students is way more likely to view this on their phone based on data that I've seen unfortunately in Google Analytics the lowest age group I can that it'll show me is 18 to 24 year olds that's not really a good group that's that's not our target audience so that's kind of like eighteen year olds our target audience but we want eighteen in below so I can't get actual analytics data from our current site for that audience but regardless I don't think it'll be disputed that mobile is going to be the primary means so assuming this is the first thing people see one thing we definitely need an image that fits of the school we may or may not put that image in today I don't really want to spend time going through the photos that we have on the stream I'd rather do some code so we will be changing the image just so you know these buttons will probably remain the same for now what we really need to do is scroll through and just make sure what we got to put something right here you know this first section needs to grab attention so that's that's my big thing you know further down the page is becomes less and less important but probably anything like from here up we need to put something you know special in those those sections you know not only for the end user which will be this perspective students but for the meetings we need to grab you'll grab the attention so I'm thinking you know something like this with a nice impressive quote is fine potentially a video I think would be good but I know that some of the people that are going to be in these meetings are going to want to see a student profile so since we already brought in the student profile data well I already brought it in earlier today I think that's what we should do is really try to make a card or a section that highlights current students and I mean I don't know I guess maybe they found that the prospective students really like to see stories occurrence so for whatever reason that's what we're gonna show them so that's what we're gonna work on first we're gonna try to design and then develop as a react component some element which we'll showcase on a mobile screen an image a name and then a little bit of information about a student and we'll provide a link to a page that has more information maybe even a video so we have some things that we could work from right now like we were going to use this this doesn't look good on mobile so let's start out maybe we'll start from here at least we'll have something and then let's see how we can switch this around to make it look make it look better so now I think about it I don't want to use this first this looks better on desk desktop but I think something like this would work better on a mobile view all right let's start with that let me read through the live chat really quickly since I know there's it seems like there's a lot a lot in the live chat are ready hey everyone okay we I do have some good advice for the meetings here John Hanson says you have to push the ease speed booze and AHS don't go for the power under the hood Tech Talk that's good advice definitely I'm gonna have I'm gonna really try to remember that to not talk technology probably the only thing I'll get into that is just simply there's gonna be reliability and there's gonna be no downtime when we update I don't really need to get into why unless somebody asks see juggernaut says Pete speed is key 47% of customers expect a website to two seconds or less 40% of customers will abandon a website that takes more than three seconds to load that's awesome those are the kind of statistics that I really want to lead with juggernaut says every second that customers have to wait longer than three seconds reduces their satisfaction by 16% 79% of customers who are dissatisfied with website performance are less likely to repeat the purchase 44 percent of online shoppers tell friends and family about a bad online shopping experience cool juggernaut if you have a source for this like a link or something please send that to me because I like I want to use some of these statistics but in case somebody says where are you getting this info I'd like to be able to point them you know somewhere so if you do have that that'd be great otherwise I'll probably spend some time looking up sources myself just to have it ready all right let's start this timer let's let's start doing some code well some design slash slash code here right it kind of makes them together alright so we're gonna be on our index.html component let me start in grok so you all can what was it already started I guess I never shut off an grukk it's been on for days well not that anybody's really been on it okay so try this link for n grow up let me know if it doesn't work I assume it's still gonna work but I don't know that I've ever kept it on this long looks like it's working awesome okay where's our index page let's make this a lot bigger okay so for right now we're going to do everything in the index page well obviously we want to break this out into its own component at some point well let's go down and find a card let's see which one this one all right you should be the second card that we have here there we are okay so let's just work with this card and start to change it since we already have it here what I'd like to do is grab let's check out a student let's check out that student page that I showed you at the beginning so let's open a new tab low blows nice there we go the student profile so let's look at Noah Fisher I've never met Noah Fisher don't really know who Noah is but let's take Noah's stuff here so let's just get this is just a demo so I'm not gonna actually pull in real data yet it's it doesn't make sense for at this point which is really kind of like more of a design stage but I do want to grab the image URL okay we are getting right now I'm pulling the images from the current database so that's all going to change at some point for now it'll be okay so let's change this image to this first of all let's change the name we need a title right yeah we're gonna need that the title which would be the students name we can see right away does this image work right I don't care about the larger screen for now okay that image actually works for a card like this great okay so there's the image I think materiai has a title component built in let's grab that component I know I'm material I open somewhere on my screen there it is so we're using material UI's beta version if anyone wants to check out the docs as well it's material UI next comm to make this a little bigger for everyone also I'm gonna try and make this stream like kind of a shorter stream because I forgot to eat forget these lunch before the stream I was just working in like on a roll and so I know I'm gonna be getting super hungry soon I've been waking up really early so like 900 a.m. is like lunchtime for me now so I'm definitely past that that time all right where's our card here it is all right so let's check out oops yeah I want the demo so let's look okay this is kind of what I'm looking for a card that looks more like this let's just check out a few other examples yeah I think this one is the best fit for us here so let's see what else we're using all right so there's not really a special component they're just using typography headline okay that that works fine let's just grab let's grab all of this inside here and copy it over just so you know in case you haven't watched before I am definitely going to get to you all your questions in the live chat as soon as this Pomodoro session is over so if you if you are asking questions and I'm not answering back please be patient and I will answer all the questions in about 20 minutes or so car okay let's save that so we get the auto formatting what you're not gonna auto format for me I was pretty sure I had it all set up I guess not you know what I don't think I copied everything that I call content actions actions all right the indentation just came over really weird I'm gonna leave it alone for now let's change this to be the name though uh how you suppose are saying so like if this year okay Noah Fisher and let's grab a little bit of the content that's here you know what let me let me grab some of the content that actually came through from the content management system so when I pulled this in from the database it had it already had some like an excerpt basically already there hmm looks like the excerpt has the name in it as well I don't like that this we may have to manually go in and change this but I'm gonna grab what was what was in that excerpt out of WordPress that's on my other screen and let's paste that into here just for testing we can worry about how we get that data in there later I really think after looking at some of this data I'm definitely gonna have to have somebody go through it manually and make some changes there's just not going to be any way around it there's some things that just I just can't work with all right fr unipi great and then for our buttons we're gonna make that's good learn more yeah let's just leave a learn more button in there for now all right let's see what we have yeah you know what I really don't like that this is showing up like that I want this to be more everything else I gotta really like about that headline h2 why's this let's check out why this h2 is looking like really not like an h2 at all all right sighs did we change I'm wondering if we changed something earlier I don't remember this I remember changing the size of this let's see what it's supposed to be in material you I was supposed to look like yeah it's supposed to look like this something's up I suspect maybe I just changed something so let's check out our code let me look at the live chat as well to see if you all caught the error okay it doesn't lose anything about it in there right now check up here hmm yeah I don't really see anything here that would be causing that the only place I'm even messing with font size is here but I don't think that's that would do anything there yeah all right well maybe I'll just switch this up let's just try some different H values see what changes if anything looks like nothing Wow so an h1 ends up with the same value let's see so I'm just checking the live chat quickly yeah I'm not sure what's happening with this we could certainly just put some inline styles in here to override this I suppose rather not do that if I don't have to let's see what we've done here here's nine oh yeah let's let's check out the code for this next one down typography type headline component that's exactly what we wanted to do right very type headline all right this is variant headline let's go with type I'm not sure what the deal was with the variant so if we switch it to type though maybe that'll work there we are that's interesting see I did have it does say variant headline here that's weird unless it's possible that this changed in a very new version of material UI and we haven't upgraded it yet I mean maybe maybe we need to upgrade and then change that we'll see I'm not interested in doing that right now though all right so let's see what you all think then so I don't know this doesn't seem very eyecatching to me right now I am gonna I'm gonna get on the end Rock server on my phone so that I can see what it looks like on a real device let's see i'ma send it to myself on slag okay actually that looks a lot better on a real phone all right so here's what if you all can look at this on your mobile devices I think that would actually be helpful you there's definitely a much different feel looking at this on a phone than I'm getting from here so I'm just a better way to do it really happy for an grukk right now although I know you can do this through dev tools as well but juggernut says good luck Jessie thanks for the streams oh you're welcome thanks for for all your advice you put in there I mean shake my tongue all right we're good it's been about eight minutes I'm gonna go back to the live chat and answer questions so if you just hang in for a little bit longer I'll get to them so here's a few things that I'm noticing this text here could definitely be smaller it's kind of overkill being this large so we should definitely decrease the size of that text at least for mobile and then for this do you all think it would be helpful to have some sort of indicator that this is a student profile right now it's just someone's name we don't really know anything about who this person is we have to read this to get some sense and even then this could be a like an alumni profile we don't really know so let's think I don't want to add too much onto here maybe yeah maybe we can add something maybe right at the top here maybe like student profile and small like small font all caps though in a different color so I'm thinking maybe something like we did for C eyes catechetical Institute's their resource cards so if you all see that how we have you know obviously this is the text we want people to see but you can see here in a different color you know just like I said all caps it tells us what it is what category that is let me know what you think about it I'm gonna try to implement this then I can't unfortunately I can't just take what we did here because we used a different system for this a different UI system we use materialized CSS it would be kind of nice if I could just copy it over you know we did use it in our bulletin project let's go to github the react version of the bulletin I believe did the same thing so let's check it out it should be under components and attachments a little post preview I think that's it so the post preview the card view yeah here's our card view and what did we do we are using material UI ear typography caption okay so we use typography caption and we did have some styles we will pull over the styles as well but see this is the benefit I think I've talked about this before but the benefit of trying to use a system and stick with the system is stuff like this to where we have these use cases that are similar enough that we can just go back to a previous project pull the code and really get a jumpstart on what we're doing all right so we're gonna copy this first and then I'll bring the Styles over oops wrong way so right here and we're gonna change this for now we're gonna say zoom profile and then we're gonna pull over this category color class we'll probably change the name of it once we pull it over and now category category actually works here that makes sense area category color I don't know where any the other the other stuff is coming from it seems like this we're doing some other stuff too can I wear your color oh we were doing category to uppercase we yeah we can definitely change that with with CSS alright so we'll change it a little bit let's see oops keep going the wrong way nice let's change this to category and then up here we'll add it in this category we're obviously gonna change the color we'll keep it like this for now though and then let's go what is a text there's a text transform let's check this out I can't remember what the very value is we'll see if this works yeah that worked okay cool so it is text transform uppercase so here we go we have it here let me check on a phone before I smell swith the size even on my phone it's still a little small so I don't want it to be too large but that's that's definitely too small so let's let's increase the font size slightly see what we're working with right now in terms of font size computer 12 pixels yeah 12 is no good let's make it at least 14 you know I really don't like going much lower than like 18 or 16 let's just change it right here and see let's see about 16 pixels see what that does that's too big we're gonna have to go to 14 the only other option is if we made this title a bit bigger but I really don't want to alright so let's try 14 is the font size and see how that looks on a phone as well obviously it doesn't come through and dev tools we'll have to add it to the code and save that to see what it looks like font size and got a comma and what do we say 14 yeah and I definitely yeah I think I wanted different color as well student profile let me refresh okay so that should be coming true now on my phone too to do anything yeah I did okay cool all right I think that's that's not bad I don't know how many you can see it on your phone as well but I like that I like that I think the the font for the body of it could be a little bit better and then we could potentially put this in quotes so that it's more obvious that this is Noah Fisher talking okay alright so my timer went off let's take a short fiveminute break i'ma go to a live chat answer any questions that you all have so I'm gonna scroll up and start up near the top so the older questions first let's see there was some advice for kind of that circle view that I had so I don't think we're gonna go with that and not that we won't use it somewhere else but just for this particular case I think I'm gonna go with this on a desktop view I may actually go with that circle view that that we had so I'm talking about this I think it it works a lot better when it's larger so we may use that nikki is asking about the HTTP sites being marked is unsafe so Google announced that chrome is going to start marking sites unsafe that have HTTP instead of HTTP so iniki's asking does that mean that images also have to be HTTPS like everything I believe so so right now I think what happens is if you're loading insecure assets on to a site that's supposed to be HTTPS it won't display like the full HTTPS there'll be some sort of warning icon for that so well it looks like John Hanson already answered but yeah you need to make sure all your assets are HTTPS blake ass if anyone's checked out react ql you know what i read a little bit about it but i haven't tried it yet probably for this project since we're so far along I'm gonna stick with Apollo for the graph QL stuff but I'm open to trying it out on other projects quanti Xie asks if this is react yeah definitely we're using react right now so we're doing more of like the design stuff so not getting heavily into react components but we are working in react components so you know this is inside a react component we're using you know styles as a JavaScript object which is one way to do styles and react so potentially this may be helpful if you're learning react let's see I jog you're not saying I don't know which what technology univer University uses now but adopting two open standards will allow University to share data between services and systems more easily avoid getting locked into specific piece of technology or supplier reuse software components built by others including open source components reduce overall cost of your digital service change your services design every time we're easily yeah okay so that's definitely the the reason one of the reasons behind the switch is exactly that I don't want us to get locked in like we're we're currently have been locked into a system we're moving everything to open source stuff and we're trying to use things that like okay so let me tou is open source we're using react which is used everywhere our content management system is WordPress but since we're pulling the data in with graph QL we could grab data from wherever we're not really locked into that also says looks good on the phone checking on an s8 awesome alright Nicky says rename the type property to variant and material UI update beta 32 so you are okay so Nicky is it was confirming that it is in the latest version of material UI they did change that type property to variant so where we were I had this wasn't working for us that's because I copied this from the latest documentation and type is now variant so whenever we do update to that we'll just have to keep that in mind and go through and change every instance of type to variant assuming that there's no backwards compatibility built in also says maybe below the name as well yeah we could do it below the name we should maybe think about that right now do you all think it would be better to have student profile above or below the name right now I I kind of would rather have it above the name but if enough of you disagree I can try to put it below it wouldn't be that big of a deal just to try it out let's see I'm almost to the bottom of the live chat so I'm going to glance quickly to see if there's anything I should address right now okay looks like you Yoshi knows if I'm pronouncing it wrong please let me know but I know she knows says above the name looks nice to be honest awesome I mean we'll probably just stick with that alright one last question before we start I arose in please let me know if that's if I'm pronouncing that wrong says what's the best IDE I use adamant is is that meaning visual studio cut better than these I use Adam and visual studio code I like them both visual studio code does seem to be a little bit faster but if you have a good computer it really doesn't make a difference I have not used sublime but I've heard it's good a juggernaut also did a adopting open standards in modern tech also attract future students exactly exactly a juggernaut that's you you definitely get like exactly what like I've been trying to do here gradually you know over over the last two years that's kind of been my you know trying to just update and move things forward and this is kind of like the pinnacle of that and finally getting the main website off of you know this old stuff so hopefully I can convince everyone that I need to convince that that is the way to go and we can get this up and running soon someone in a meeting like that I wasn't in threw out a date of July June first I think of June first there's no way we need till June first to finish this site and I'm afraid if we did take till June first then everybody in the university would want to have their saying and how things go and we would just get swamped with all these competing ideas but I'm all for collaboration on that but sometimes you can have too many people you know putting their input in and then we'd end up with a very cluttered kind of mess of a site and that's not what we want all right let's go start our Pomodoro clock and all right let's see okay I did want to try to make this see how big we can make this while it still looks reasonable and we want to decrease and see how small we can make this that it would still stand out all right so let's check inspect this right now and I'm gonna see what they have 14 oh yeah I'd really rather that be 16 pixels so let's see what 16 looks like on here first oh yeah for sure this I think 16 looks a lot better let's try putting this in and then on the phone let's see so component Peas I think how I can do this what's the best way to do this would be for now I'm just gonna do it like this and this will show a different way to do styles and react sty and let's go with whoops I did not need this font size yeah 16 right 16 pixels okay so if you want to do inline styles what did I mess that up it's possible that I just messed that up I think it was just a style thing okay so you can do inline styles like this you need to use curly brackets to drop in the JavaScript mode and then more curly brackets to make this a JavaScript object then you know just like we did up at the top we're putting styles in a JavaScript object so we use camel case for our keys and then our values for the most part you want to put your values in quotes if it's just simply a numerical value with no units you don't have to put it in quotes alright let's see how that looks great and that is coming through like this I don't know that I would want to leave this probably what I want to do is maybe find some solution where every component that has PE here for under type with the typography component would then automatically be minimum of 16 pixels I don't really want to figure out how to do that right now with material UI but that's probably a better solution that would just take place across the board let's see oh I want to look at it on a phone as opposed miss Andrew there's one more step oh yeah I yeah that is I don't know if you all can see that on your phones if you can that's just so much more readable I like that I really like that I want to see what it looks like in those quotes as well so let's do it like that I wonder for a second I thought what if we do a blockquote right what about how would that look maybe we can take a look at that yeah the quotes are okay I'm looking at on my phone let me go over maybe there is some other way to format this that might look nicer but for now this I think is acceptable let's adjust the font size here so let's go with maybe 20 pixels whoa way too small all right let's see 3030 is actually not that bad yeah let's see what I'm using here for this typography display yeah let's just try to go with a different type here display three maybe I'm not sure if there is a display three but we'll try it out well let's take this off whoa displace still too big display for okay as you go up it gets bigger let's try display one I was thinking they were like age tags okay all right display one is much more reasonable let's just go with that those will set it to display one let's check it all these different display values they're built in the material UI so if you're not familiar with that that's what we're doing yeah that's that's much more reasonable and that reduces the amount of scrolling significantly great that's wonderful cool all right now let's go we're gonna try Nikki says plus one for trying blockquote okay let's do that for sure let's try block quote I want to see I'm assuming that there's a block quote no a scooter that typography component we go to the API and check out the props here we display four three two one headline titles subheading body one body two caption button maybe they don't have all right so based on my three seconds I spent searching it doesn't look like there's a blockquote component or option here so let's just use the block quote element you know straight up just the HTML element and see how that looks oh yeah okay so I'm going to do is copy this and let's just put it over over here this is kind of just my place just throw stuff if I want to save it for later and I keep forgetting to implement the search well that's what this is up here what maybe we'll do that on Monday I think it would be cool to have the search function available because that that's the search works as you're typing you automatically get results and that seems to impress people so I'd like to have the search function working as well for our demos alright so let's take this and say quote chuckle die let's see what happens okay so when we make that a blockquote yeah I'm not I don't think that really adds much it's seems maybe like material I doesn't have a blockquote kind of built in let's see what I'm saying Brooke says just give it a left border that's like gray I guess before it was better okay yeah let's switch it back actually I can just I don't need to copy that over we'll switch it back and then maybe we could add let's add that border so you see which all right yeah let's grab that P let's do a border left and we'll go two pixels two pickles might be too small we might have to go three Bobble the two pixels solid and let's go or G be a zero zero zero and goes zero point five four and that should give us a nice gray mmm yeah it's too thin and the gray seems too dark so let's bump this down and go maybe 14mm twentyfour all right 24 and then let's jump up I think four pixels might be better yeah I like four pixels and then let's give this some padding padding left of eight pixels wonderful all right what do you all think of that so yeah so we've given a four pixel border with a pixel padding the padding goes between the border and the content if we went margarine it would be on this side so that's why we went with padding instead let me let me put that in the code and then you all can see that on your screens or on your phones let's make this a class now so let's make a blockquote class and classname classes let's just call it quote I don't want to confuse it with the element blockquote so we're just gonna call it quote we can take this out of here because we'll add this in as part of the quote class quotes and we'll just paste that in and then we'll change it up font size 16 pixels we're trying we need to camelcase everything and put the proper wou quotation marks get rid of the semicolons and now this should work let's go back here and great looks good refresh great alright there we are I'm gonna check this out on my phone I Nikki that was a great idea I think I really that adds something that looks nice it's just a little thing but I don't know it makes a difference let me know what you all think I don't want things to be too busy but really I mean this is gonna this is really kind of a clean minimalist site so I'm not worried yet that it's getting busy but I I like it I'm hoping other opinions though see looks like so far so far everyone likes it awesome Nikki again great idea on that cool alright cool and I did go with that RG oops I just realized I had my phone right next to the mic so I'm sorry if there was any distortion in the audio huh that sometimes happens when I have my phone too close anyway so say I go with that rgba because especially when I'm trying to do black I usually don't use it for other colors very often but for black it's so nice to be able to just you know on a scale of 0 to 1 being able to adjust the you make different shades of gray essentially you know by adjusting that is just really nice and then you know there are certain values that I use consistently this so like usually for gray text for alt text I don't use regular black I use you know 0 0 0.87 and then for text that I'm using in a form like the little hint text you put in there and in like a form element like an input that's iu 0 0 0 point 5 4 so those values are always consistent throughout all the sites that I do for the university so there's there's some consistency and then you know for little elements like that obviously we adjust you know but for at least for the font it's very consistent alright great the only thing we didn't really do anything about was this learn more but you know what I like that it's coming up with the University Green already which which i think is fun that looks good and so on I'm okay with that all right let me check my timer alright about eight minutes so at this point what would be nice to do would be to pull this out into its own component potentially add in some some options right so we would want to have the option to change this type here this category right so that we could use it with multiple things so maybe we want to use this as a faculty profile or an alumni profile this component could definitely work for all of those we could also have options potentially for more buttons and we definitely want this button to be a link as well so we want this we wouldn't leave it just like this we would want to put a link component in here yeah for sure those would be options and then we could just fill in the data you know as we pull it in from from WordPress we had another suggestion to try out okay so nikki says maybe we can remove the quotes and Ahmed says we could try italic let's try it out right I think I don't think I have time to really you know take on a whole nother component before my my timer runs out but I we do have some time to try out some of these piece ideas what do you all think about the idea to take out the quotation marks would it still be obvious that this is a quote if we take them out now that we have this let me know what you all think because I'm definitely open to taking them out I don't think they really looked at great we could maybe add something a little bit more stylish like an icon to denote I'm thinking like maybe like a larger you know quotation mark I don't know like I said I don't want this to get too busy all right let's try there's a fright Alex there's a textdecoration thought oh no it's not is it all right John says take out the quotes yo she notices italics might fit and make the marks look better if we do keep the clothes all fontstyle it's uh I'm sorry I'll met you you typed it right there I don't know what I was thinking filling font style all right oh let's just check that out sorry let me get this down to one area all right what do you all think oops I didn't put it in there let me put it in so I can see it and we can all see it on our our devices so class quote all right I'm gonna give you all a chance to look at it and let me know what you think before I say what I think about it I'm gonna check quickly about I wonder what's the is there any anything within material design that designates when italics should be used I don't remember seeing anything in the documentation I'm scrolling through the typography section right now seeing anything hmm all right so here's my impression I think it looks nice it makes it even more obvious that it's a quote but it makes it less readable so I think we have a tradeoff here do we want to sacrifice some readability or or have it look I don't know I'm a little bit I'm torn between this let's let's do this and you check my time oops alright only have a minute left let's go down here alright so I'm gonna remove italic from here and I just added an inline so we should be able to see both both versions did it not work I did something wrong oops I put it on the wrong wrong thing okay now we should be able to see him together and on different devices I can't decide I'm gonna leave both my timer just went up so I'm gonna leave both of them one for now and I think I'll probably even commit these to github like that as well we can worry about refactoring into another component sometime some other time or if anybody really wants to make a pull request you know doing that then that's that would be great as well but maybe I'll show my boss or show it to some people around here too and get their input hmm sorry sorry about the yawning okay I'm gonna go back to the live chat go through and finish up if any questions that I missed from from the last break and then I'll wrap things up here on Hill says why not work with pixels and why work with pixels and not percentage it would be better for Responsive actually yeah I would like to have the responsive text so basically what I want is a minimum that the text will never go below which is going to be like 16 pixels and then it could get larger from there so I'm open to doing that I mean for now which just was easier for me to use pixels and I mean I pretty much think in pixels I'm used to using pixels so I know in my head like here's how this will look with the other units that I could potentially use I I just can't see in my head what that's gonna look like so when I'm doing things like this I'm always in pixels but I'm open to doing other things you know when it's time to actually you make the final version of this also says what if you put the name below the text on the right side and remove the italic text all right so it would look more like like the citation for the quote I think about that I'm not gonna try it right now because you know at a time my time I ran up but I'll keep that in mind is an alternative what I'll probably do is show these to my boss too and if it looks like he's not that excited about this design I'll bring that up as an alternative to okay all right I see y'all were talking more about putting it below yeah yeah I think about that anything yeah I'm wondering just from like a marketing standpoint would it if you put the quote with a small name below it then the quote itself is highlighted and the name is in a secondary place if you put the name at the top with the quote underneath in the name is higher up I think like if we want the student to identify with hey this is another student like a real person to say student profile and then a name makes that immediate connection and then they could read more if we want them just though to connect more with what the student is saying and just know like hey this is a student then the other way around would work better I like to think about that because I mean I could see if the quote was really good or or profound you definitely want to highlight the quote I don't know that that's necessarily the case with all these quotes maybe also the quote is is kind of like large I'm gonna think about it I do agree that putting the name below would definitely make it more evident right away that it is a quote hmm this would be a really good thing to do for a be testing I potentially have multiple versions of the homepage where we have one with this style and and another card with the style with the name below and then we measure how many people click on that learn more button one that says with the name below it would make it like a testimonial actually you're you're right really what we're doing here is a testimonial maybe we should look at some common design patterns for testimonials and see if we can get some ideas how this is it like I could we could spend so much time on this one component really at some point I have to make a decision and say okay we have to move on Sean saying more graphical quotation marks yeah I think I could be a good idea all right I'm gonna think about these ideas if anybody would like to mess with this component and you know just to try some things out feel free if you do want to make a pull request for something like this I suggest not removing these but just adding another one like add a third one with the alternate design so that we could compare you know one after another I'm also gonna have to think about given the limited time I have before I have to present this is it worth it for me to worry about this like longer term yeah for sure I think so and I think it might be worth it to do the a/b testing but before my presentation would it be worth it for me to worry about this I don't know that I have time so I guess I'm gonna leave it at that point for now but I really do appreciate all the input because I don't think I would have thought about those things on my own okay yeah and I this is going to be really prominent I think this type of component will be prominent it will be important I definitely want to measure clicks on this this is a really good candidate for a be testing yeah so I'm going to go with that I think at some point probably not before we I do the presentation but potentially before or like shortly after we launch I think I want to do another version of this taking into account your suggestions and then test the impact that's really the only way to know which one is really gonna resonate with prospective students who more alright cool let me commit this right now so I don't forget and then you all can have access to everything that we've done in the repo so let's do it get status see what we've done great that's exactly what we modified so no surprises there we do it get add and then we'll do a yarn CM this is something like custom that we have on this project that it walks you through the pattern of making a good commit message so it's going to ask us if what this is a new feature yeah this is a new feature let's say let's see create create component for student profile card great actually that's kind of misleading I'm gonna leave it there but we didn't really make a separate component because we didn't pull it out yet into its own file but I'm not gonna go back and change it right now we did not break anything and we didn't have any issues open so all our tests are gonna run our linting is gonna run I don't know what did we do HTML entities must be escaped where is the set oh it doesn't like the quote alright let's just take the quotes out for now then I'm okay with that well I can change my message now all right creates even profile card all right that's more accurate because we didn't turn into a component just yet there we go should pass this time looks like Nikki wasn't a fan of the quotation works anyway so now they're gone Noble and savage says forget what hi Jesse tis Savage banana soup hey how's it going thanks for joining us all right cool to get was origin Oh between last stream and now I also did merge that next five branch with masters so after I upgraded it again and checked everything out everything was working fine so I thought okay let's just merge it back and now if you see any weird things happening please let me know but I think we'll be okay with it for now okay Nikki says you can do yarn cm retry to commit the exact same thing messages and all it's better yeah yeah that's really helpful because a few times that's happened to me and I've had to type it in again and it's really frustrating especially if you get errors like three times in a row which has happened so yeah I'm definitely gonna try my best to remember that and use it so that is helpful yeah in this case I wanted to change the commit message anyway but thank you Thank You Nikki alright so I think I've gotten through everything and so I'm gonna finish things up here and go get something to eat thank you so much for all your help I think we made a really nice component today I think it looks great and then we also have some ideas for some variations on this component as well which is also awesome at the very least it might not be a bad idea to use different variations of the same component on the page at the same time just to kind of mix it up for people yeah yeah I think that would be good now that I think about it we probably could get some quotes from some more like famous people like since this is a Catholic school like we could probably get some quotes from some bishops and stuff that might be impressive to prospective students or their parents and we could use this for that as well so I could see this component as being very useful for a variety of you know different pieces of content all right well it's Friday have a wonderful weekend I'll see you all on Monday
