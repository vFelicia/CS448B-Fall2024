00:38 - it's Monday and uh I'm looking for a
00:41 - portfolio remarks that other people did
00:44 - about my project about this portfolio
00:47 - page I asked for the feedback on Reddit
00:50 - critique I also posted my project in fre
00:53 - Cod Camp Forum it's not easy to give and
00:57 - get the feedback on designs because it's
00:58 - very subjective
01:00 - however it's really worth doing worth
01:03 - getting it makes you better not just
01:07 - only as the designer but also as the
01:09 - developer because you have to finally
01:11 - Implement all of the new
01:13 - Solutions I will look for some
01:15 - inspiration uh on Pinterest dribble and
01:18 - in difficult come Forum how others did
01:21 - their portfolio maybe something
01:25 - uh maybe there will be something that
01:28 - will really inspire me to redesign M
01:32 - portfolio I'm not sure uh what should I
01:35 - change exactly um because uh the
01:38 - comments are like you know it's too big
01:41 - too small uh about the same thing it's
01:44 - too bright too dark so it's always very
01:46 - subjective you have to be careful with
01:50 - [Music]
01:58 - that
01:59 - [Music]
02:04 - yeah
02:07 - [Music]
02:28 - yeah
02:34 - [Music]
02:50 - it's Tuesday one of the co- campers just
02:54 - uh surprised me with the answer because
02:57 - uh the person wrote that it's it's a
03:00 - pleasure to work and to learn to learn
03:02 - sorry it's pleasure to learn from
03:04 - experienced people like you and if he
03:06 - knew how beginning level I am maybe he
03:11 - wouldn't write so he continues as we
03:14 - beginners as we beginners so I'm not I'm
03:18 - rather too um can go so deeply into the
03:21 - code thank you so it was the response
03:25 - for uh for my project review so I did uh
03:29 - the code review of the project and try
03:31 - to help a bit we beginners very often
03:35 - underestimate ourselves I got to the
03:37 - same problem you know practice makes
03:40 - perfect and also practice helps you to
03:43 - get rid of this impostor syndrome and
03:45 - whatever it's called so everybody's
03:47 - starting some from somewhere and the
03:50 - thing is to keep on doing keep on
03:53 - learning and getting better developers
03:56 - who have years of practice but stay in
03:59 - the same
04:00 - language and they do not develop they
04:02 - are also beginners in other stuff they
04:05 - know more uh they can connect the adults
04:10 - and learn the new Frameworks and
04:12 - languages faster but still they are
04:15 - beginners so everybody is a beginner and
04:19 - the awesome thing about code Society is
04:23 - that we share the knowledge we help each
04:25 - other and that's great so keep on
04:28 - learning practice and we will be all
04:30 - experiencing something as a result we
04:32 - can share our knowledge help ourselves
04:35 - and develop as a community keep on
04:40 - [Music]
04:58 - doing

05:04 - what's behind these Clos doors but I

06:07 - I've been changing a bit the colors in
06:09 - some projects correcting
06:12 - accessibility or changing a bit the
06:15 - layout majority of the changes uh were
06:17 - the results of the feedback that I got
06:20 - sure in the beginning you think okay
06:22 - they are not right I did a lot of work
06:25 - you know everybody who is a Creator
06:28 - loves the work more than the audience
06:31 - the problem is that we don't see many
06:35 - things that other people see because
06:36 - they see the project for the first time
06:39 - whatever it is concerning the
06:40 - application it's worth asking the more
06:43 - you ask the better you know the better
06:46 - your app can look 76 5 4 3 2 1 you'll
