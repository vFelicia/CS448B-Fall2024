00:40 - welcome back to the free Coke Camp
00:42 - podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and
00:44 - founder of free Coke camp.org each week
00:47 - we're bringing you Insight from
00:48 - developers Founders and ambitious people
00:51 - getting into Tech this week we're joined
00:54 - by jabril jabril is building a
00:57 - turn-based fighting game called Ultra
01:00 - bouts and he's developed a ton of games
01:03 - over the years which he's featured on
01:05 - his very popular YouTube channel all
01:08 - about game development got lots of links
01:10 - to cool stuff that he's built over the
01:12 - years that you can check out but first
01:14 - jabil how's it going man Quincy thanks
01:17 - for having me man thanks for the intro
01:19 - that was such a great intro thanks yeah
01:21 - I just I rehearsed when I told you
01:23 - earlier I just rehearse when I'm like
01:25 - walking back from dropping my kids off
01:26 - at school like just kind of yeah any
01:29 - anyway yeah I'm thrilled to have you
01:31 - here man cuz like I've just enjoyed so
01:33 - much like uh watching your video lat I
01:37 - always watch it late at night because
01:38 - it's so entertaining and you I find you
01:40 - like laugh twice as hard at things when
01:42 - it's like a little bit after bedtime so
01:45 - uh yeah man like I was just watching
01:47 - like for example the fake Shark Tank
01:49 - Episode generator tool that you created
01:52 - that that creates the the scripts from
01:54 - like uh Shark Tank and like they're very
01:57 - absurd product ideas but like you know
01:59 - it feels just like an actual Shark Tank
02:01 - Episode in terms of the absurdity of the
02:04 - show which is if anybody spent a lot of
02:06 - time in business you know that the show
02:07 - is pretty divorced from reality in terms
02:10 - of how business deals actually go down
02:12 - but that's that's part of the fun of it
02:13 - right it's reality television which is
02:15 - really hyperreal television yeah yeah so
02:19 - anyway I'm sorry to like ramble right
02:20 - off the bat man but it's great to have
02:22 - you here yeah it's great to be here man
02:24 - I'm excited to talk about all things
02:25 - code and development and Game Dev and
02:28 - let's get into it awesome and I just
02:31 - want to point out also jabril uh
02:33 - contributor to the freeo camp Community
02:35 - you can check out his
02:37 - 5our introduction to programming course
02:40 - it's very flavorful and it's very
02:42 - different from like kind of like the
02:43 - more straight lace course that I would
02:44 - develop if I were creating of course
02:46 - it's you just have all these different
02:48 - kind of like visual gags and other
02:50 - things you do to like really engage and
02:52 - help people retain everything so like
02:55 - yeah I'm going to link to that as well
02:57 - in the show notes be sure to check that

03:42 - devs who are in the field building
03:45 - projects getting players play testing
03:47 - refining and continuing to extend their
03:50 - library of awesome interactive
03:52 - experiences for people interactive art
03:54 - really um so yeah jail I just want to go
03:58 - way back I always like to start with
04:00 - childhood like tell us about little jbr
04:04 - tell us about like your early formative
04:05 - years and how you got into Game
04:08 - Dev yeah let's go back uh before I do
04:12 - that I want to give a shout outs to you
04:13 - guys over at free code Camp love what
04:15 - you guys are doing keep it up um so
04:18 - let's let's go back I think it's it's
04:19 - probably best that I start with um I was
04:23 - I think 9 years old I was living in
04:25 - Virginia at the time my father's in the
04:26 - military so I've been around the coast
04:28 - of the United States
04:30 - and I played a lot of video games when I
04:33 - was growing up actually I should take it
04:34 - back back back when I was I think four I
04:36 - think it was my mom used to play a lot
04:38 - of video games on the Super Nintendo and
04:40 - she used to play uh Donkey Kong Country
04:43 - and I would watch her play this game and
04:45 - I was just so amazed because she had a
04:48 - control in her hand right and she's
04:49 - controlling Donkey Kong but there's
04:51 - other agents on screen and as a young
04:54 - kid I'm like who who's controlling the
04:56 - agents who's controlling the other ones
04:58 - right and so I've always had a FAS but
05:00 - it wasn't until I was about 9 years old
05:01 - when I was introduced to the first Smash
05:03 - Bros on Nintendo 64 and I don't know
05:06 - what it is about that project that game
05:08 - it just like got my game development bug
05:12 - like just running and I will never
05:14 - forget we moved from Virginia to
05:17 - California and I had a notepad and the
05:19 - entire time I'm just like designing
05:21 - levels that I would do if I was the
05:23 - developer for Smash Bros um and then
05:26 - fast forward to I think it was like I
05:28 - was 14 and I got an advertisement for
05:31 - this thing called Game Maker it's like
05:33 - you can code you can code you can make
05:36 - games without coding what the ad and I
05:37 - was like no way Mom can you buy this for
05:39 - me and she was like well if you do your
05:42 - chores for a week straight I'll buy it
05:43 - for you you dang right I did my chores
05:46 - for we week straight she bought it for
05:48 - me and that was the last time I got a
05:49 - full night's sleep wow yeah so you
05:53 - pretty early on you were like I love
05:55 - games I I'll tell you a little anecdote
05:57 - about Smash Brothers when it came out
05:59 - like of course I was like a big N64 like
06:02 - like I had N64 actually had four
06:04 - controllers cuz I loved couch co-op
06:06 - games as as they're called now you call
06:08 - it couch Co-op because you're actually
06:09 - playing in the room with other people
06:11 - unlike most you know online games today
06:14 - uh and I remember like that was such a
06:16 - game changer it was so imaginative I
06:18 - just I couldn't believe the absurdity
06:19 - like wow I can actually go up as Donkey
06:23 - Kong and punch Mario in the face like
06:26 - and knock him off the level and even
06:28 - like the the actual intro stuff kind of
06:30 - like like the final boss is like hands
06:32 - and it it really evokes kind of like a
06:33 - childlike play like you're actually like
06:36 - you pick up your action figures as a kid
06:38 - and you'd have He-Man and Skeletor fist
06:40 - fight and stuff like twisting him around
06:42 - and stuff and and that kind of it had
06:44 - that that Vibe of like I'm just a kid
06:47 - who's hanging out on a summer day and
06:48 - playing with my action figures yeah such
06:51 - a cool game yeah it's an amazing game
06:54 - huge competitive uh scene around that
06:57 - game too which I never would have
06:58 - imagined like people getting so good at
07:00 - it they dedicate like years to getting
07:02 - really good at playing Princess Peach in
07:03 - Smash Brothers Melee like a specific
07:05 - character in a specific game but it's a
07:07 - Legendary game you know it's Legendary
07:10 - game yeah so okay so you get game maker
07:14 - your your mom gets it for you after
07:15 - being a really good kid for a week I
07:18 - don't know about all that but uh I did
07:20 - my choice what what what were the first
07:22 - few days like uh when you had game maker
07:26 - like what were the first things you
07:28 - experimented with okay man so it was
07:31 - Game Maker 5 and they had a bunch of
07:34 - examples I'll never forget it it was
07:35 - like a I forget what the actual game is
07:38 - but it was like a plane game 2D plane
07:40 - game and it was like an example project
07:43 - and then they showed you how to like
07:44 - shoot bullets how to control the plane
07:46 - move left and right how to spawn enemies
07:49 - and I just spent so many hours trying to
07:52 - understand like what every little
07:53 - component was doing and all the examples
07:55 - that they had I think they had just
07:58 - converted over to mark in game maker as
08:00 - a something you can make games without
08:02 - coding so like a drag and drop system
08:04 - like really early days and I did the
08:08 - best I could to understood like the
08:09 - logic that was going on and then I made
08:11 - my first project was was like a a pong
08:13 - remix if you will uh I can send you an
08:16 - image of that I still have images of it
08:18 - yeah and it it was terrible it was an
08:21 - absolutely terrible game uh I did not
08:24 - understand physics but I did the best I
08:26 - could uh but I shipped it so that's
08:30 - that's pretty important and then I just
08:32 - kept on I and then I learned about the
08:34 - forums I learned about the game maker
08:36 - forums which was like so important to my
08:40 - learning on how to use Game Maker
08:42 - because all of a sudden I had this
08:43 - resource to all these people that
08:45 - haven't doing it for years and I ask
08:46 - them questions they will answer it and
08:48 - yeah yeah so getting hooked up with
08:52 - other game developers like did you find
08:54 - that that like was a huge motivational
08:56 - shot in the arm in terms of like I'm
08:58 - actually showing off to people that I'm
08:59 - interacting with did you feel like you
09:01 - found your So-Cal you know your tribe so
09:04 - to speak yeah yeah 100% And I think one
09:07 - thing that's easy to miss from back in
09:10 - the days is that distribution of games
09:13 - was not it was not a thing like you were
09:15 - making games for yourself and maybe 10
09:18 - other people in a forum thread that's
09:20 - about it so back then like you had to do
09:22 - it for the love of it and I think that
09:24 - having discovered the Forum it really
09:27 - helped keep that love alive you know
09:31 - yeah I mean did you build any games that
09:33 - you just like kept to yourself like this
09:34 - is my game like I just want to like I'm
09:37 - the only person who's ever played this
09:39 - this game kind of like a lot of
09:41 - musicians they like hoard like their
09:42 - best work just for themselves to enjoy
09:46 - there were a few projects where that was
09:47 - the case but I I wouldn't say I put like
09:49 - all my time energy into it um the ones
09:53 - where I put a lot of time energy I
09:54 - wanted as many people to play as
09:55 - possible but again back in those days
09:57 - like you're talking 20 down it's like oh
10:00 - my God yes I can't believe this yeah but
10:03 - there there was one project in
10:04 - particular I'll never forget that I made
10:06 - with my brother and sister and it was
10:09 - you you had to like race to the
10:11 - helicopter it was like a three-player
10:13 - game we had to split the keyboard into
10:15 - three different controls through like it
10:17 - was was arrows and something else and we
10:19 - just shared a keyboard but it was so fun
10:21 - to you know be able to put our
10:23 - imagination you know into an app it was
10:26 - a good time do you play with you said Lo
10:29 - WD just for anybody who hasn't gamed
10:32 - recently like that's those are the keys
10:34 - that I guess
10:35 - customarily uh people playing like
10:37 - Counter Strike and stuff will use but I
10:39 - actually use esdf because it gives my
10:42 - pinky like access to more buttons for
10:44 - like switching weapons and stuff so and
10:46 - I I know uh I learned about this from
10:48 - Gabe Newell founder of steam uh or of uh
10:52 - valve uh now the steam company instead
10:54 - of making games they just have a game
10:56 - platform they do occasionally put out
10:58 - games but uh but yeah he he's like a
11:01 - esdf player instead of a wd player how
11:05 - do you what do you have any particular
11:07 - since we're on the topic like do you
11:08 - have any particular like control scheme
11:10 - quirks that you think are unique to
11:13 - you uh I don't think so honestly these
11:17 - days I if it's not a Gamepad I don't
11:19 - know if I can play
11:21 - it okay yeah so so even like for PC
11:24 - games and stuff you like plug a
11:25 - PlayStation controller in or something
11:27 - like that I'm a I'm a huge Gamepad buff
11:30 - I have so many game pads like weird ones
11:33 - and all types of unique ones so yeah I
11:35 - have a bunch of ones that will fit the
11:36 - best need for whatever the game is if
11:38 - they support it of course awesome yeah
11:40 - do you ever get like like the steering
11:42 - wheel type game like or like the flight
11:44 - stick do you do any games like that I
11:47 - wish that I had time to invest in stuff
11:49 - like that I my dad had one when I was
11:51 - younger and it was pretty fun but now
11:53 - days I I don't have like an hour block
11:54 - to just dedicate to that unfortunately
11:56 - so it's not worth the investment well
11:58 - you're you're focused on getting getting
11:59 - things done and making games not just
12:00 - playing games right so um so before we
12:03 - get into like full-blown game
12:05 - development I do want to learn a little
12:06 - bit more like so you went from the
12:08 - forums was there like a particular like
12:10 - Apo in game development where you're
12:13 - just focusing on that very small
12:15 - audience of people on the same thread on
12:17 - a forum like hey I've been working on
12:18 - this game here's the latest build you
12:20 - know stuff like that was there was there
12:22 - a transition period where you started
12:25 - making games for like a broader audience
12:27 - and do you remember what that Reflection
12:29 - Point
12:31 - was um H that's a great question
12:35 - honestly I don't think that really
12:36 - happened until I started the YouTube
12:38 - channel yeah now there was like a a
12:41 - rudimentary form of that so on the
12:44 - forums I I don't know how many active
12:45 - people there were I'd say probably a
12:47 - hundred people were active you know a
12:49 - given month any given month and if when
12:51 - you got good enough in the community you
12:55 - could have a a thread post that you
12:58 - would update like your game is doing and
13:00 - people would chime in they would play it
13:01 - and give you feedback but it required a
13:03 - certain level of skill and I remember I
13:05 - hit that I hit that threshold for like
13:07 - one or two of my projects but by that
13:09 - time I was you know transitioning out of
13:12 - game maker and getting into like you
13:14 - know High School sports and going to
13:16 - college prep and all that stuff you know
13:17 - so so a lot of people's passions are
13:21 - derailed by high school and like the
13:23 - kind of high school metag game so to
13:25 - speak like oh I've got to be were you
13:28 - were you like a popular kid at school or
13:29 - like how would you describe your high
13:31 - school
13:32 - experience I wouldn't say I was popular
13:35 - in the sense that like a lot of people
13:37 - correlate like the popular kid too I got
13:39 - along with everyone so I I guess I was
13:41 - popular in that sense but no I wasn't I
13:43 - definitely wasn't the popular kid and
13:45 - and it's interesting the school that I
13:46 - went to I I was definitely in the closet
13:50 - about making games I didn't tell anyone
13:53 - just due to the school that I went to
13:54 - like no one cared about it and it was
13:57 - kind of nerdy if you will back then so I
13:59 - wasn't trying to get stuffed in the
14:02 - locker you know yeah have you like so
14:05 - this is just like an observation like I
14:07 - I saw this interesting video essay you
14:09 - know I watch lot lot of video essays on
14:11 - YouTube uh and it was about like how
14:14 - like nerdy and geeky and like these
14:16 - terms have kind of like almost fallen
14:17 - out of use because like everybody's a
14:20 - Star Wars fan now or you know uh you
14:23 - know a Lord of the Rings fan or
14:24 - something like there there's not really
14:25 - a stigma associated with using computers
14:29 - like there used to be I mean have you
14:30 - observed that
14:32 - like I mean do you ever feel like what
14:34 - you're doing is quotequote nerdy anymore
14:36 - when you're like you know making these
14:39 - very you know artial games that are very
14:42 - esoteric and like probably a very small
14:44 - subset of Gamers let alone people at
14:47 - large would be interested in playing
14:49 - these
14:50 - games yeah the so nerves are definitely
14:53 - in Vogue now and I think about this
14:55 - quite often it's hard to unpair my
14:57 - experiences as a nerve as a kid right
15:00 - from you know the the man that I am
15:02 - today but uh it's so I think it's so
15:06 - beautiful that there are so many people
15:08 - that I can reach out to and have
15:10 - conversations about code about game
15:12 - development about apps because I
15:14 - remember when I was starting out it was
15:15 - nearly impossible to find anyone to talk
15:18 - about this stuff with like I was lucky
15:20 - that my mom had a friend that knew
15:22 - someone that had a software development
15:24 - job and when I asked him for advice he
15:26 - just gave me Visual Studio 20 for
15:29 - something like that he just gave it to
15:30 - me and it was like good luck like that
15:32 - was all I had and I remember trying I
15:35 - tried to install it and I was like I
15:36 - have no idea what this is and I just
15:37 - never touch it again um but yeah I think
15:40 - it's so beautiful that you know nowadays
15:43 - you can talk to literally anyone about
15:44 - code and they'll have some idea and I
15:46 - think it's just due to the prevalence of
15:47 - how important you you know code is and
15:50 - how prevalent it is in our society
15:51 - nowadays you
15:53 - know yeah 100% like I've definitely
15:55 - found that like when I'm at a dinner
15:57 - party or something uh it used to be like
15:59 - even 10 years ago I'd be like oh yeah
16:01 - I'm a software developer and people
16:02 - would be like oh okay cool and the
16:04 - conversation would just move in move on
16:05 - but now people are like oh cool like um
16:08 - I'm working on this app you know or like
16:11 - I've been doing some python on the
16:13 - weekend and stuff like that and like
16:14 - suddenly like it just seems like the
16:16 - number of people who are interested in
16:18 - learning programming has skyrocketed and
16:21 - that any like uh there there's kind of
16:23 - like there used to be that like oh it's
16:25 - for smart people type talk but I don't
16:26 - really hear that anymore when I talk to
16:28 - people
16:29 - it could be that just like the crowd I'm
16:31 - rolling with is a little older now um
16:33 - because I'm older so like when I go talk
16:36 - to people they're often in their 30s and
16:38 - 40s like I am you know uh as opposed to
16:40 - like younger kids when I was a kid like
16:43 - people were like not very sure of
16:45 - themselves and they would often like
16:47 - limit themselves but you know as you
16:49 - grow older you start to realize oh like
16:51 - these limits are artificial you know
16:52 - like there's nothing stopping an
16:54 - accountant from getting really good at
16:56 - coding right um I did you I think it's
17:00 - more than that though well I I I think
17:03 - it's a bit more than that I think that
17:05 - you know just relating to my experiences
17:07 - when I was a kid the accessibility to
17:10 - these things were so hard to get to
17:12 - right but we have things like free code
17:14 - camp for example right where if I want
17:16 - to learn something I just go to free
17:17 - code camp and you guys have all these
17:19 - resources for me to learn how to do
17:20 - these things right and this is something
17:22 - that we have to thank the modern era for
17:25 - you know uh you you know you take game
17:28 - maker for example I'm so happy that they
17:30 - decided to do a drag and drop system
17:32 - because without that I don't know if I
17:34 - would have I don't know how long it
17:35 - would have took me to discover code you
17:37 - know but that was a good entry point for
17:39 - me to say like hey this looks like
17:41 - something I can do you know you're
17:43 - you're telling me I don't need to code
17:45 - but little did I know it was a stepping
17:47 - stone to the actual code because there's
17:48 - limits to what you can do with the
17:50 - dragon drop but the point I'm trying to
17:52 - make is that I think just things have
17:53 - got a lot more accessible in the Modern
17:55 - Age and it has really enabled so many
17:57 - people to be able to learn to code or
18:00 - just simply know more about what it
18:02 - takes to code or be a coder you know
18:04 - yeah absolutely well uh I'm really
18:06 - interested in like understanding kind of
18:09 - the tools that your tool progression
18:11 - because you said that uh you had like
18:13 - some some friend who gave you visual
18:15 - Studios which is a gigantic very
18:17 - complicated piece of software right like
18:19 - that's like an industri at 15 yeah so
18:23 - you that's like giving somebody the
18:24 - master sword right when they walk into
18:25 - the cave instead of like you know stair
18:28 - stepping them up through like some sort
18:29 - of like leveling progression right uh so
18:33 - what what did you do you're like you put
18:35 - that down did you just go back to game
18:36 - maker like what what tools did you get
18:38 - into do you remember the sequence of
18:40 - tools you progressed through well funny
18:43 - enough the the I got Visual Studio
18:45 - before I even knew game maker existed so
18:49 - I knew that I wanted to make games but I
18:51 - didn't know how it it like I cannot
18:55 - explain how my understanding of making
18:58 - games
19:00 - was like how how difficult it was for me
19:02 - to to grasp the concept of making a game
19:06 - how do you use a computer to render
19:08 - Graphics to render logic Etc I I can't
19:11 - explain to you like how difficult trying
19:13 - to imagine that was um and so yeah the
19:17 - first I asked my mom and she had the
19:19 - friend he gave me Visual Studio I was
19:20 - like here you go this is how you code
19:22 - good luck that was all he gave me I
19:25 - tried to install it I tried to install
19:27 - it didn't work thankfully like a year or
19:29 - two later I discovered game maker uh and
19:31 - they did game maker for like four years
19:33 - I think it was something like that and
19:35 - then I found Unity soon after that and
19:38 - tell us about Unity just like for people
19:41 - that are uninitiated like why is Unity
19:43 - different from you know like n SDK for
19:45 - developing on like PlayStation or
19:47 - something like that right yeah Unity it
19:51 - just provides so many things for you it
19:53 - makes like developing games so easy uh
19:56 - they do graphics for you they do physics
19:58 - for you they do um different like pathf
20:01 - finding logic they do so many things for
20:03 - you right out the box that you don't
20:05 - have to think about the hard stuff you
20:06 - can just get started making some type of
20:08 - game and then in the process of making
20:11 - your game using their their out of
20:13 - thebox tools you learn how to like use
20:16 - those tools more proe over time and that
20:18 - was really instrumental for me I I'll
20:20 - never forget when I first started Unity
20:22 - that using Unity was the first time I
20:24 - ever made a 3D game it was always my
20:26 - goal to make 3D games but having done 2D
20:29 - for so long I thought it was like such
20:31 - an impossible task but in the first I
20:35 - think week of using
20:37 - Unity so much of what I learned with
20:41 - game maker not to mention game maker has
20:43 - their own coding language as well so
20:45 - that was another thing that was like oh
20:46 - I'm not a real coder I'm using gameer
20:48 - language yeah exactly it's like I'm not
20:50 - really coding I'm using scratch or I'm
20:52 - using some simplified for but it really
20:54 - is still coding I think people kind of
20:56 - like talk themselves out of like like
20:59 - you know acknowledging what their their
21:01 - accomplishments they they kind of like
21:03 - denigrate their accomplishments oh I'm
21:05 - just using the training wheels
21:06 - equivalent but it's still coding right
21:08 - yeah yeah 100% And so I'm using Game
21:11 - Maker language and I'm like I'm not a
21:12 - real coder because I'm using their
21:14 - little subset language right but then I
21:16 - start to uh develop games in unity I was
21:19 - like why not right and I was like wait a
21:21 - second this is C this is this is a this
21:24 - is a big boy language I know what a for
21:26 - Loop is I know what an if statement is I
21:28 - I know what a wild Loop is like hold on
21:30 - I know all these Concepts and like it
21:32 - was so easy to transfer from game maker
21:34 - language to C and then from there C to
21:37 - Python and then yeah it as long as you
21:40 - learn the basics I don't no matter what
21:42 - the language is like coding is so easy
21:44 - to transfer the skills over yeah
21:46 - absolutely like at the at the end of the
21:48 - day it's like the same basic like data
21:51 - structure and algorithm Concepts that
21:53 - have been around since Allan Turing
21:55 - right maybe maybe like a few were
21:57 - refined by subsequent generations of
22:00 - computer scientists and then you're just
22:02 - applying math that has been known all
22:04 - the way back to like aisi back and like
22:07 - yeah you the ancient uh you know Indian
22:09 - civilizations and Babylonian
22:10 - civilizations and stuff right like
22:12 - there's nothing new Under the Sun except
22:15 - layers of extraction that make it easier
22:17 - and will continue to make it gradually
22:19 - easier and easier and and we'll
22:21 - definitely talk about that in a little
22:22 - bit but I what were you doing now you
22:24 - can make a 3D game right it's not some
22:27 - pipe dream it's it's something you
22:29 - actually did within the first week of
22:31 - using these tools yeah like what was
22:34 - that like a honeymoon phas for you were
22:35 - you like walking on air knowing like wow
22:37 - I'm actually doing it yeah I was
22:40 - incredibly proud I I believe the first s
22:43 - game I made was a game Jam uh it's still
22:45 - up somewhere it's called
22:48 - super hay stack finder or something that
22:51 - super stack finder finding a needle in a
22:53 - Hast stack or something like that that's
22:54 - yeah that's the concept so you're
22:56 - jumping platform to platform you're
22:57 - looking for a little a cookie for some
22:59 - reason um so that was the first project
23:02 - I did and I was like there's no way like
23:04 - this was so easy you just add one extra
23:06 - Dimension and it's not that difficult
23:08 - and then from there I made my first app
23:10 - that I launched on the Google Play Store
23:12 - it's called Pizza jump still up to this
23:14 - day and I was so proud of that game I
23:16 - was so proud uh and then from there like
23:19 - the sky was the limit I was unlocked I
23:21 - was Unleashed like I I I will I never
23:24 - will forget that after that project that
23:27 - was when I really realized that like
23:29 - there are no limits I can do anything I
23:31 - can do anything and then from there I
23:35 - got into python which I want to say
23:37 - really
23:38 - quick there's one piece of advice that I
23:40 - have for anyone who especially like
23:43 - starting to develop no matter what
23:45 - language it
23:47 - is be very careful listening to some
23:49 - people who try to give you advice on
23:51 - like what language is good or bad or not
23:53 - because there were so many people that
23:54 - telling me that python is not a useful
23:57 - language and it's it's for beginners and
24:00 - it's not a good language but python is
24:03 - so powerful like when I started to code
24:06 - in Python and how simple it was to do
24:08 - certain Concepts comparative to to C I
24:11 - was like what are you guys talking about
24:13 - this thing is amazing and then obviously
24:14 - you got all this support and you can do
24:16 - Ai and artificial intelligence learning
24:18 - it but yeah there just so many lessons
24:21 - that are coming to me at at such a short
24:23 - period of time that I'll never forget so
24:26 - it's almost like uh like a lot of the
24:28 - kind of Mythos around game development
24:30 - is melting away and you're seeing like
24:32 - the actual day-to-day of game
24:35 - development the Practical considerations
24:36 - how do I get distribution for my game
24:38 - how do I um come up with interesting
24:40 - ideas that are going to be fun how can I
24:42 - recombine these different game
24:44 - development Concepts and tropes that
24:46 - have been pioneered through like the 70s
24:49 - 80s 90s like how can I recombine those
24:51 - into interesting games right I I don't
24:53 - mean to be putting too many words in
24:55 - your mouth but that's I imagine you're
24:57 - probably going through something like
24:58 - that as a kid who's just built their
25:00 - first game using
25:04 - Unity yeah and and so where did you go
25:07 - from there like so you're in high school
25:09 - you're building games like do you show
25:11 - your friends you said that you didn't uh
25:13 - that you kind of kept your game
25:14 - development to yourself because nobody
25:15 - was interested in that stuff they're
25:17 - probably interested in you know typical
25:18 - high school stuff like football and
25:19 - getting a car and other stuff like you
25:21 - grew up in California right like you
25:23 - said you moved for what uh area of
25:26 - California were you in I live in San
25:28 - Diego and went to a very very Urban
25:30 - school so yeah a lot of the kids there
25:33 - they're used to playing like the Call of
25:35 - Duties and Need for Speed and all the
25:37 - you know the the triaa games I'll never
25:39 - forget I showed my friend I I had this
25:42 - really uh rudimentary but cool drifting
25:45 - game like like car drifting game yeah
25:48 - drift racing game that I showed my
25:50 - friend and it was like gray box and
25:52 - whatnot but and he just laughed at me
25:55 - he's like what is this like why would I
25:57 - ever play this you know and I mean
26:00 - listen I understand where he's coming
26:02 - from you know why would he waste his
26:03 - time playing that when there's like Need
26:04 - for Speed etc etc but I'll never forget
26:06 - that experience I like yeah I'll just
26:08 - keep this in my little Forum friends
26:10 - that sucks man that's that's so
26:12 - discouraging but like like let's talk
26:15 - about kind of opening up and blossoming
26:17 - of the BR as you kind of like so you're
26:20 - going to have lots of encounters like
26:21 - that just like like I had similar
26:23 - encounters with my writing like I'd
26:25 - write like a short story I'd show it to
26:26 - somebody they'd be like oh man this is
26:28 - why would I read this when I can go read
26:30 - you know you know bestselling book by
26:32 - somebody right that you get it like the
26:34 - supermarket or whatever you know like
26:37 - how did you kind of did you ever stop
26:40 - doing game development at any point I
26:42 - did I did I had a I think it was like a
26:46 - four-year gap of I didn't really touch
26:48 - code at all wow
26:50 - um yeah it was so The Story Goes at 15 I
26:56 - introduced to game maker five and then
26:59 - I'm making games really passionate about
27:01 - it but then I think I I turned like a
27:04 - junior in high school and all of a
27:06 - sudden like you know I'm interested in
27:08 - girls and being cool and going to
27:11 - parties and stuff right and so that's
27:13 - where I start to invest a lot of my time
27:14 - and I just like stopped touching code um
27:17 - but I pick it back up at I think like 23
27:21 - or something like that so from 19 to
27:23 - like 23 four years something like that
27:25 - 23 24 um is when I pick it back up again
27:28 - cuz you know if you have a passion for
27:30 - something like no matter what it's
27:32 - always going to poke you so hey was it
27:34 - like calling to you from the bookshelf
27:36 - like you just walk by your old uh Unity
27:38 - books back in the day we'd like buy
27:40 - actual gay like books like these big
27:43 - thick books some of them would come with
27:44 - CD ROMs and stuff I don't know if that
27:45 - may have been before your time CU you're
27:47 - a little bit younger than me but like
27:48 - did you ever like look at your old
27:50 - things like oh like kind of like heave
27:53 - like your chest little huh like like Toy
27:56 - Story when he kind of like gets tired of
27:58 - the toys and uh maybe Toy Story 10 Toy
28:01 - Story 11 he actually becomes like Tom
28:03 - Hanks character from big where he's like
28:05 - working at an exe you know as like a toy
28:07 - tester at some big toy company or
28:09 - something like that you know like like
28:11 - pining back for the for the toys did you
28:13 - ever feel that kind of like that you
28:16 - were trying to deny a part of yourself
28:20 - that Society was like causing you to
28:21 - like deler V deler from that childhood
28:25 - ambition yeah I think in hindsight I
28:27 - definitely agree with that obviously in
28:29 - the moment I I didn't have any awareness
28:30 - of this but yeah I think it hit a point
28:33 - where I realized that all these things
28:35 - that I was chasing externally didn't
28:37 - really matter you know like when the
28:39 - friends dried up and the party stopped
28:41 - you know calling me to come over all
28:44 - you're left with is these memories that
28:45 - you have as a kid you know spending 16
28:48 - hours a day developing this game that 10
28:50 - people are going to look at you know
28:52 - yeah and yeah it was calling me back I
28:55 - was like hey look I you know really
28:57 - enjoyed those times s and I want to have
29:00 - memories like that again so I picked up
29:02 - game maker again started making some
29:03 - games again and then it hit a point
29:05 - where I wanted to 3D and so Unity was
29:07 - that option yeah so like once you hit
29:11 - the ground running with unity like like
29:13 - maybe you can just take us give us a
29:16 - quick tour of the next few years of your
29:17 - life like what what were you doing did
29:19 - you have the equivalent of like you know
29:23 - Kanye staying at home an entire summer
29:25 - making beats you know like where it was
29:27 - like a Renaissance of creativity or like
29:30 - what happened yeah yeah yeah yeah I I
29:33 - yes 100% that that was me from 15 to
29:36 - like 18 like every single Summer from
29:39 - that point on I was like nope don't want
29:40 - to go to parties no don't want to do
29:41 - anything I'm just going to sit here in
29:42 - code games um but in terms of so I I I
29:48 - got to
29:49 - Unity I think around like 23
29:52 - 24 and then I'm making games in unity
29:55 - and I'm watching all these different
29:56 - tutorials and whatnot and I'm also
29:59 - making YouTube videos not I'm not making
30:01 - the YouTube videos I'm making today I'm
30:02 - making like documentary style YouTube
30:05 - videos but then I realized that like
30:07 - there's a lot of people that have
30:09 - tutorials on how to like make these
30:11 - games and whatnot right but there
30:13 - weren't a lot of channels of people
30:15 - making stuff from what they learn from
30:17 - the tutorials yeah and I was like I'm
30:20 - going to do that that sounds like fun
30:23 - you know you kind of found a new Lane uh
30:25 - and and like I have lots of friends who
30:26 - do this genre of YouTube video where
30:29 - they're like I built this game like like
30:31 - or they speed up the development and
30:33 - it's like just lightning fast like here
30:35 - now we got the character jumping and not
30:36 - like slumping over and stuff like that
30:38 - right so like I to some extent I think
30:40 - you inspired or helped inspire a lot of
30:42 - people who now do that kind of uh game
30:45 - development and like actually apply the
30:47 - skills that they learned from tutorials
30:48 - on like free code camp and places like
30:49 - that right can you talk about like an
30:52 - early video that you created and at what
30:54 - point did you start uploading videos to
30:55 - YouTube it was like maybe like eight or
30:57 - eight or nine years
30:58 - ago yeah that's a whole other that's a
31:01 - whole other Branch but yeah
31:04 - yeah been a long time before we get to
31:07 - that you've been building games like I'm
31:10 - just trying to bridge the past with the
31:12 - present like yeah what point did you
31:14 - start like like did you why did you even
31:17 - approach YouTube did you were you like
31:18 - this can help me raise awareness of my
31:20 - games or I just I have time I'm just
31:22 - going to create some videos for myself
31:23 - and my friends what was your philosophy
31:26 - I I've done a lot of things all right
31:28 - I've done a lot of things I'm going to
31:29 - make it really brief because that's a
31:31 - whole other branch of the story but to
31:33 - make it short and correlated to the
31:35 - coding stuff when I was in high school
31:37 - me and some buddies got together and
31:39 - decided to make a a YouTube channel okay
31:41 - we didn't have any skills we didn't
31:42 - really know anything so we made a prank
31:44 - Channel okay it was just a thing to do
31:46 - back then and that taught me a lot about
31:50 - uh how to build audiences how lucrative
31:54 - it can be to create internet content and
31:57 - so that bug that that bug was like the
32:00 - the foundation for me to later create
32:02 - the Channel that I have
32:04 - today but so long story short it hit a
32:07 - point where the pranks where YouTube
32:09 - demonetized all pranks across the
32:11 - platform I was okay this this Jig Is up
32:13 - right yeah however I knew that there was
32:15 - still a lot of value in speaking to an
32:17 - audience and you know giving them
32:18 - entertainment and value and so I made a
32:21 - documentary Channel where I would just
32:23 - document various things that was
32:24 - happening all the while in the
32:26 - background I come home and I'm coding
32:28 - like hours and hours and hours at night
32:30 - but it didn't dawn on me to share what I
32:32 - was doing it was this is past game maker
32:35 - Forum so I didn't really have anyone to
32:37 - share it with it was just kind of like a
32:38 - me thing I did for myself you know as a
32:40 - as a meditation if you
32:43 - will but yeah one day it hit me that I
32:47 - spend I was spending so many hours
32:49 - developing games and apps so many hours
32:53 - watching tutorials and what I wanted was
32:56 - more content on YouTube
32:58 - of people demonstrating their learnings
33:01 - from these this content and at the time
33:04 - there was maybe one person that was
33:06 - doing
33:07 - it and so I decided to completely
33:11 - Rebrand my channel to
33:13 - jabrils we're doing coding now and I
33:16 - think like the fourth video blew up I
33:19 - did a AI machine learning project in
33:22 - unity and uh good times good
33:26 - times yeah so um first of all why is
33:30 - there an S at the end of your name
33:31 - jabrils is like Jail's Channel
33:35 - or is that why I I love this question um
33:40 - you're going to be a little disappointed
33:42 - the answer is just because I find it
33:46 - funny I can't tell you how many times
33:48 - like i' I've been in rooms with execs
33:50 - and they call me jbr's plural and it's
33:53 - just so it's just funny I don't know if
33:56 - I call it's test of whether people
33:58 - actually know who you are
34:01 - like no we like um so I have a friend uh
34:06 - and what she does is like she puts like
34:07 - an emoji like a Ramen Emoji or something
34:09 - at the front of her LinkedIn name that
34:11 - way when like recruiters or some
34:13 - automated message sends it it always she
34:15 - can always see the ramen Emoji at the
34:16 - beginning of her name and she knows oh
34:18 - this isn't a real person who knows me
34:20 - this is just like some bulk like mail or
34:23 - something like that so smart
34:26 - unfortunately no I just find it funny
34:28 - when people refer to me as a plural it's
34:30 - just funny it's like if I call you
34:32 - Quincy as you multiple people it's just
34:34 - funny that's it yeah that'd be like the
34:36 - Quincy from Bleach everybody's tell I
34:38 - haven't seen bleach but everybody's like
34:39 - oh yeah the quincies like people
34:41 - occasionally every once in a while you
34:42 - get this email I want let you take my
34:44 - bonai what's bonai you know but
34:47 - apparently there's like this race of
34:49 - like Angels or something like that in in
34:51 - this show Bleach and they're the most
34:53 - powerful cuz they can take away like the
34:55 - Bleach characters like weapon the Bon
34:58 - anyway sorry but but like yeah so you
35:03 - have this YouTube channel the fourth
35:05 - video blows up of course like this
35:07 - happens to a lot of people like free C
35:09 - Camp we published uh you know some
35:11 - videos that really blew up like after
35:13 - like I think like three or four years
35:14 - and we're like oh should we chase this
35:15 - success like maybe we should lean into
35:17 - this like Lane that we found and it's
35:20 - it's hard to reproduce that lightning in
35:22 - the bottle yeah what was your like after
35:24 - that fourth video what happened I did
35:27 - not learn learn my lesson unfortunately
35:29 - it took me a while to learn my lesson
35:31 - what I mean by that is so this video
35:34 - blows up and it reaches a large audience
35:36 - an audience I've never seen before
35:39 - and in hindsight I realized like what I
35:42 - should have done was really capitalize
35:44 - on the audience give them more of what
35:45 - they wanted but instead I continued to
35:48 - make content that you know was just
35:50 - really for me and the views didn't
35:53 - really match that but I I think it was a
35:56 - really important part to to my journey
35:58 - but it did give me a greater audience
36:00 - than what I had previously
36:02 - but yeah so so maybe you could talk
36:04 - about that balance of like balancing
36:06 - your own interest rather than just
36:07 - becoming like YouTuber person who's the
36:10 - generically approachable interesting
36:12 - person that like you know probably does
36:15 - well on YouTube but but I think to some
36:18 - extent the algorithm probably forces you
36:20 - in certain directions in terms of uh
36:23 - being not yourself but being who people
36:25 - want you to be right like I imagine if
36:28 - you're like a late night TV show host
36:29 - you have to shave off a lot of the edges
36:32 - and and you know like probably similar
36:34 - with YouTube I I mean I don't know this
36:37 - because I've steadfastly refused to
36:40 - adopt like various conventions around
36:42 - you know video podcasting like I didn't
36:43 - even do video podcasting for a long time
36:45 - and now that we're doing them I'm doing
36:46 - them in like a kind of a weird way like
36:48 - no editing uh any of that stuff that
36:50 - it's like unconventional but it's I want
36:53 - to do it I want it to be real right like
36:57 - how did you balance like you probably
36:59 - saw the numbers like oh people don't
37:01 - like the real jabril as much as they
37:02 - like the jabril from video number four
37:05 - do I have to like put myself in a you
37:07 - know freeze myself in time and just be
37:09 - that exact person for every video if I
37:10 - want to get traction like did you go
37:12 - through that kind of like soul
37:14 - searching it it took me a while to to
37:16 - understand that dichotomy of content uh
37:19 - I'm I'm saying like probably a couple
37:21 - years ago when I really understood this
37:23 - this dichotomy of content um but at the
37:26 - time you you know I was just happy to
37:28 - have any audience watch this watch stuff
37:30 - that I was doing uh but yeah I I it I
37:34 - think that it's not necessarily like
37:36 - what the algorithm is encouraging I
37:39 - think it's more rooted in just human
37:41 - nature right like you turn on any show
37:43 - and you you have some expectation as to
37:46 - what you're going to see right if you
37:48 - turn on America's Funniest Home Videos
37:51 - and all of a sudden they start showing
37:52 - like an a hockey match you be like yeah
37:56 - what what is this I'm never going to
37:57 - watch this again right and you know it's
38:00 - a lesson I had to learn and it is really
38:02 - unfortunate but on top of that I think
38:04 - it's what has inspired me to do things
38:06 - like create a manga or create a game
38:11 - because that element of pleasing an
38:14 - audience really only affects you when
38:16 - you rely on it to pay your bills right I
38:19 - don't rely on the manga or the game that
38:21 - I'm making Ultra bers to to pay my bills
38:24 - therefore I can be as free as I want in
38:26 - my expression with those projects
38:28 - and you know the the the goal with the
38:31 - YouTube channel is to hopefully get to
38:32 - someday where I figure out a way to have
38:35 - that free expression while also paying
38:37 - my bills but it's easier said than done
38:39 - and I'm I'm currently in that Journey so
38:41 - yeah so if you don't mind me asking like
38:43 - like how how do you pay the bills like
38:46 - uh and and maybe you can talk about how
38:48 - you paid the bills like graduating from
38:49 - high school and just you if you
38:51 - graduated and and progressing in general
38:54 - I say if you graduated cuz I I didn't
38:56 - graduate I dropped out as a sopore
38:57 - but like a lot of people uh like they
39:00 - they kind of have this listless period
39:03 - uh did you go to
39:05 - university I went to Junior College for
39:08 - a couple years and then dropped out okay
39:10 - so lot going for the wrong degre yeah
39:13 - what were you wrong degree I was
39:15 - studying film and communication no one
39:17 - told me all right no one told me um but
39:20 - we're s we're literally sitting in class
39:22 - watching movies and like writing essays
39:24 - on movies and I'm just like what what am
39:26 - I doing
39:28 - and so I I was I dropped out with the
39:30 - plan to return to do biology cuz I love
39:32 - biology so much but I learned that my
39:35 - financial aid right now and I was not
39:37 - down to to a loan so yeah well so you
39:40 - dodged the loan bullet uh that's good
39:43 - like you did you figured it out before
39:45 - you had taken on a whole lot of you know
39:47 - potentially restrictive debt that you'd
39:49 - have to pay off um which the credit card
39:51 - they the credit card companies hate me
39:53 - for they tell me I need different types
39:55 - of loans yeah exactly
39:58 - uh well congratulations on that so you
40:01 - you dropped out of Junior College what
40:04 - happens what do you do this is like at
40:06 - some point you did create the YouTube
40:07 - channel but like or maybe you've been
40:09 - doing the YouTube channel for a while
40:11 - but like how did you get from that
40:14 - jabril that didn't really know what what
40:17 - to do to a person who you know has a
40:22 - pretty large like half a million
40:24 - subscriber YouTube channel who's like a
40:26 - household name among game developers who
40:30 - uh built a lot of games and has a lot of
40:32 - games in the App Store and just comes up
40:34 - with really cool projects that we're
40:36 - going to talk a little bit about later
40:38 - like seemingly like every few months you
40:40 - you pop up you're like hey here's this
40:41 - crazy new thing that nobody's ever done
40:43 - before like how did you what what was
40:45 - the transition period yeah between those
40:48 - two
40:49 - people yeah so I I've always had
40:52 - multiple things going on like since as
40:55 - early as I can remember and at the time
40:58 - that I'm doing College I'm also filming
41:00 - for the prank Channel that I was talking
41:02 - about not too long ago and so me and my
41:05 - buddies will get together on the weekend
41:06 - we film the prank stuff and that it
41:08 - didn't pay any bills like it was you
41:10 - know it paid gas for us to get around
41:12 - town every once in a while we get like a
41:13 - sponsor deal and we would split it but I
41:17 - did that at that time I was I was living
41:20 - off financial aid but after that ended I
41:23 - got I started doing a bunch of odd jobs
41:25 - so I worked at a comedy club uh what
41:29 - were you doing
41:31 - then I was I didn't have an official
41:33 - title so it was a new comedy club that
41:35 - opened up in San Diego called American
41:37 - Comedy Co and I just remember code uh
41:40 - emailing the owner because there's a
41:42 - bunch of articles on it and I was like
41:44 - hey I will do anything please just let
41:46 - me help you out I was like yeah sure
41:48 - come by and then I came by and I never
41:50 - had official title but I helped out with
41:52 - marketing I helped out with um you know
41:55 - a little design and whatnot
41:58 - uh that was a lot of fun but that ended
42:00 - for me and then I got into doing uh
42:03 - working at a radio
42:04 - station uh all the while all the while
42:07 - I'm still making YouTube videos trying
42:08 - to figure that part
42:10 - out and then I worked at the radio
42:12 - station for about four years to pay the
42:15 - bills and then oh man I don't know how
42:19 - deep you want to go into this I've done
42:20 - a lot let's do it Comedy Club to a radio
42:24 - station you've had an interesting life
42:25 - so far yeah
42:28 - okay and
42:29 - so so the radio station was the last job
42:31 - that I ever
42:32 - worked and when I left the radio station
42:36 - life got incredibly interesting and
42:38 - difficult at the same
42:40 - time man okay I'm G break it down
42:44 - so at the at the end of me working at
42:47 - the radio station I had a friend that I
42:48 - knew that made prank videos that I met
42:50 - through making prank videos right his
42:52 - name is Garrett his Channel's called
42:55 - over when you say prank video just give
42:56 - us an idea of what a prank video would
42:58 - this be like like MTV punked or
43:00 - something like that or like what what is
43:01 - it what is a prank
43:03 - video
43:05 - so I'm trying to think my favorite prank
43:08 - video that we did so like one video that
43:10 - I did is um I did like a magic trick so
43:13 - I had like a shirt that had a graphic on
43:16 - it but it was like a it was like a magic
43:18 - trick shirt right so like I go and ask
43:20 - people for directions say hey do you
43:22 - know where this thing is and they point
43:23 - me to directions but then like I turn
43:24 - around and do a magic trick the the
43:26 - graphic would change and I turn around
43:27 - it's a new uh graphic and then like wait
43:31 - did your shirt change I'm like what were
43:33 - you talking so it's stuff like that you
43:34 - okay so basically kind of like uh yeah
43:36 - yeah it's just like gaslighting people
43:40 - essentially just that's one way to put
43:42 - it Quincy
43:44 - yeah Okay cool so so I'm sorry like I
43:47 - just wanted to get an idea that sounds
43:49 - like a pretty cool I didn't know there
43:50 - were like design changing shirt I won't
43:53 - ask the mechanics of that cuz I don't
43:54 - want to ruin it if you know how what
43:56 - happens with the quarter when it's
43:57 - supposedly behind your ear it makes it a
43:58 - lot less interesting right but um maybe
44:01 - you can talk about that go back to that
44:02 - friend who was doing these videos with
44:04 - you yeah so so he had his own channel
44:07 - and he had a lot of success from uh
44:10 - doing YouTube
44:11 - pranks way more than I had right and we
44:15 - had reconnected when I was working at
44:16 - the radio station and you said hey I
44:17 - need help filming are you willing to
44:19 - like you lived in Orange County I lived
44:21 - in San Diego it's about 100 miles
44:23 - something like that apart yeah both very
44:25 - nice places to live by the way
44:27 - very very nice places
44:29 - indeed and so I agreed I I would go up
44:32 - to his house I think on the weekends and
44:34 - then stay for a few days help him film
44:37 - then I go back home uh but it hit a
44:40 - point where I was filming with him so
44:42 - much I had forgot that I had a shift at
44:44 - the radio
44:45 - station and they called me and they're
44:47 - like hey you have a shift I'm like I am
44:50 - not in town I cannot make it and so like
44:53 - they call me in they like give me the
44:54 - talk and whatnot they didn't fire me
44:56 - thankfully but I go back to my buddy and
44:58 - I'm telling him about this this this
45:00 - dilemma how fun it is to film with him
45:02 - and how annoying it is to go work at
45:04 - this radio station he's like you should
45:06 - just quit you should quit come work with
45:08 - me I'll pay you some money and it'll all
45:10 - be good and like I'm terrified you know
45:12 - content creation is very risky and So
45:15 - eventually I say okay I'll do it I quit
45:18 - I go work with him a month later we're
45:21 - no longer working together what happened
45:24 - I
45:25 - had there's a lot of drama there's a lot
45:27 - of drama he was going through some stuff
45:29 - in his life um but it's all public if
45:32 - you don't look it up okay my homie
45:34 - overboard humor shouts to Garrett shouts
45:36 - to Garrett um but long story so so after
45:41 - a month of working with him I'm no
45:42 - longer working with him I had maybe
45:45 - $2,000 in savings and I'm like what did
45:47 - I just do and so the content creation is
45:52 - not really doing anything for me uh I
45:54 - take up a lot of odd jobs which is
45:56 - really difficult to do in San Diego at
45:58 - least with the skill set that I had of
45:59 - like film making and
46:01 - whatnot and I I'll never forget I gave
46:04 - up I was like I'm done I'm done throwing
46:05 - in the towel I'm just going to go work
46:07 - some job and figure out how to live a
46:09 - regular casual life and so I take an
46:11 - interview at a store called Joan's
46:13 - fabric
46:15 - stores so like literally like generic
46:19 - retail essentially just just just give
46:22 - me some money I'm going to be like one
46:23 - of the characters from clerks basically
46:25 - just give me some money yeah that that
46:27 - was my only priority and I'll never
46:29 - forget I walked in there and the manager
46:31 - takes me to his room really small
46:33 - cramped room with boxes
46:35 - everywhere and he's like okay so tell me
46:37 - a bit about yourself I tell him he's
46:39 - like interesting what what are your what
46:41 - are your dreams what do you want to do
46:43 - and I was taken back by that question
46:44 - and I told him I was like you know I
46:46 - really wish that I could you know build
46:47 - a YouTube channel and travel the world
46:49 - etc etc and he closes this little book
46:52 - and he says I'll never forget this you
46:55 - don't belong here
46:57 - I'm not going to hire you and I was like
46:59 - what he like yeah all I'm going to do is
47:01 - use you to stock shelves uh stock books
47:04 - uh boxes on shelves I just need someone
47:05 - tall that's it I'll be wasting your
47:08 - talent I I kid you not I kid you not and
47:11 - so I walk out of there just like what
47:13 - just happened but that gave me the
47:14 - energy that I needed to really push as
47:16 - hard as possible on content creation wow
47:20 - shout out to Joan's fabric store like
47:22 - the the manager there for setting you on
47:24 - that course that's great yeah I I wish I
47:27 - would have went and got his name and
47:28 - shook his hand but uh I'll never foret
47:31 - that if he can see you
47:34 - now yeah so that that gave me all the
47:36 - energy I needed I was so fired up after
47:39 - that and I did a bunch of content
47:40 - creation I I spent maybe eight hours a
47:43 - day doing odd job or or looking for odd
47:46 - jobs to enough where it would pay my
47:47 - bills and then one day I came across
47:49 - this odd job from someone who's looking
47:51 - for help to film physics content which
47:54 - happened to be Diana Cowern from physics
47:57 - girl and so huge YouTube channel huge
48:00 - science learning Science Education
48:02 - Channel yeah and I responded to that did
48:07 - some editing for her she liked it and
48:09 - I've been with her editor for like three
48:11 - four years and very incredibly
48:13 - grateful shout outs to Diana I uh can't
48:18 - wait for her to get better yeah
48:21 - absolutely yeah yeah so um so you're
48:25 - doing editing and and is that like how
48:29 - did you transition into like building
48:32 - some of these games were you doing games
48:33 - at the same time maybe just give us a
48:36 - little bit more context into the
48:37 - timeline so that's cool so you've made
48:40 - the transition from Radio which is
48:42 - probably a job a lot of people who study
48:44 - Communications and journalism uh and
48:46 - things like that would be interested in
48:48 - going into but um you know you stopped
48:51 - working in radio and but now you're
48:53 - working in editing for YouTube creators
48:57 - and you're still creating your own stuff
48:58 - on the side but you're paying the bills
49:00 - by working with you know a much more
49:02 - successful like name brand YouTube
49:04 - Creator right correct yes yeah so
49:07 - so yeah I would pay the bills doing a
49:10 - bunch of jobs but all the entire time
49:12 - I'm creating content like it's not
49:15 - getting views it's not making any money
49:17 - but I'm creating content the entire time
49:18 - because it was it was a fun thing to do
49:20 - that I really enjoyed and I always
49:23 - believed in his
49:24 - potential just to get the timeline
49:27 - synced yeah okay awesome and did you
49:30 - have other videos that started to get
49:32 - traction like that like your fourth
49:34 - video did you did you kind of
49:36 - like strike gold so to speak or or like
49:39 - uh kind of find that filament that like
49:42 - lights the bulb correctly to use like a
49:44 - weird uh Thomas Edison analogy like were
49:47 - you able to like iterate toward a
49:49 - formula that worked that would that also
49:51 - resonated with your passion as a
49:54 - Creator a little bit a little bit again
49:57 - in hindsight I think that I I probably
49:59 - should have been learning more lessons
50:01 - rapid more rapidly than I did at the
50:03 - time but I had did the first video of uh
50:06 - Mak a machine learning game it was like
50:09 - writing my first machine learning game
50:10 - something like that it went crazy viral
50:12 - and then I just continue to upload
50:14 - videos like as I seen it and then I
50:16 - struck gold again I made another video
50:18 - called making a game in 48 hours like
50:20 - this is before this was a trend and that
50:23 - video also went really viral but at the
50:26 - time like I was honestly just getting
50:27 - lucky you know I I was learning like
50:29 - little lessons here and there but it
50:32 - wasn't until I connected with a bunch of
50:34 - other content creators and they were
50:35 - able a like share lessons between each
50:37 - other where I really started to adapt
50:40 - you know optimal strategies if you will
50:42 - yeah yeah and like just looking at your
50:44 - most popular videos many of which I've
50:46 - watched uh you know the infinite
50:48 - staircase is real nearly 8 million years
50:51 - my first learning machine learning like
50:53 - about 2 million for that and also the 48
50:56 - hour game Jam thing uh Minecraft but on
51:01 - a quantum computer you know stuff like
51:03 - that very cool so uh a lot of your
51:05 - videos have connected with the audience
51:08 - and like I guess Way Beyond your
51:09 - audience have had like mainstream appeal
51:11 - over the years can you talk about like
51:13 - what that's like in terms of uh does
51:17 - when you have a video that goes viral
51:19 - like your infinite staircase video did
51:21 - uh I mean 8 million views for like a
51:25 - sciency topic this is not like some you
51:28 - know you're you're not like a hot woman
51:30 - or something like that right like you're
51:32 - you're just a guy who's developing
51:34 - interesting stuff he's like building
51:36 - stuff and showcasing what he's building
51:38 - um can you talk about like the the
51:41 - audience and the experience of having
51:42 - that video blow up I think I've had like
51:45 - a a tweet go viral with the BTS Army and
51:49 - that's like my 15 minutes of fame is
51:51 - like I I I tweeted something about like
51:53 - BTS just not even realizing what I was
51:55 - tweeting and like all these people
51:56 - jumped on me and that I guess that got
51:59 - like 15 million retweets or something
52:00 - like that that's like the closest I've
52:01 - ever gotten to famous so to speak but
52:04 - did you feel famous did things did it
52:07 - feel different to have a video getting
52:09 - all these views and people commenting
52:10 - and talking about it and sharing it uh I
52:12 - think
52:14 - unfortunately the sad part about
52:15 - consecration is you normalize it after a
52:18 - while
52:20 - and the any everything on the jbros
52:23 - channel comes after like some pre Fame
52:26 - that experienced so I did a prank with
52:29 - some buddies a long time ago where
52:34 - we we
52:36 - would I don't know if this is bad or not
52:38 - but it was what it was okay we went up
52:41 - to people and we asked them if they
52:42 - wanted a little pot okay right like pot
52:46 - marijuana we asked them if they wanted a
52:48 - little pot right a little pot they like
52:50 - they like no get away from me freak what
52:52 - the hell and then we would pull out a
52:54 - literal little pot like a literal little
52:57 - pot a cooking pot and that video went
53:01 - crazy viral back in the days and I had
53:03 - so many people reach out to me I was on
53:05 - TV uh someone offered to buy me a meal
53:08 - like it was it was crazy that was the
53:10 - first time it actually felt crazy um but
53:12 - everything after that I think I kind of
53:13 - normalized the experience a bit so
53:15 - you're just kind of like you're the
53:16 - equivalent of that kid like at the
53:18 - computer in the meme like yeah thumbs up
53:20 - it worked you know but then you kind of
53:21 - move on with the the content grind right
53:25 - yeah um and and you view is a a grinder
53:27 - like how how do you approach creating
53:30 - these videos about you know programming
53:32 - computer science and and demonstrating
53:34 - different projects You're
53:37 - Building yeah I don't ever do it for any
53:41 - of the fame or any things like that like
53:43 - I I do it genuinely because I love the
53:46 - ideas and I I love being able to explore
53:48 - new Concepts that probably someone
53:50 - hasn't really explored at least in the
53:52 - manner that that I want to explore it
53:55 - and so my Approach is always
53:57 - is how can I present something to you
54:01 - that you probably don't think about that
54:03 - often or probably haven't seen before in
54:05 - an entertaining
54:07 - manner uh that often when those two meet
54:10 - is often when my videos do the best yeah
54:14 - yeah well let's talk a little bit about
54:15 - Game Dev in general because Game Dev has
54:18 - changed a lot since you got into it
54:20 - obviously like game maker like there was
54:21 - a game called like Hotline Miami that
54:23 - did they use Game Maker for that they
54:24 - use like some really rudimentary like
54:26 - early tool to develop I believe they did
54:28 - yeah and I believe they that was a cool
54:29 - game because it felt like you wouldn't
54:33 - know that they'd use such simple tools
54:35 - to create such an elaborate game with
54:37 - like its own kind of physics engine and
54:38 - everything like that but
54:41 - like there was that whole Flash game era
54:45 - that you develop flash games CU
54:47 - newgrounds.com was huge when I was a kid
54:49 - or when I was a teenager like people
54:51 - would like develop these games you could
54:52 - play right in your browser and it just
54:54 - took accessibility to a new level cuz
54:56 - you just click on it it loads and you
54:58 - play it you don't have to download stuff
54:59 - you don't have to like buy a physical
55:01 - media that you put into a console or
55:03 - anything like
55:04 - that yeah I definitely played more flash
55:07 - games than I
55:08 - made uh I might be mistaken on the
55:11 - timeline but I think by the time I was
55:13 - able to you know grasp logic and coding
55:17 - it was kind of past its prime I may have
55:20 - the timeline incorrect here but I
55:21 - definitely remember when I was younger
55:24 - playing flash games this was like before
55:26 - for Smash Bros and all that mhm
55:29 - um and but I do remember trying I made
55:32 - like one Flash game and I just remember
55:33 - being really annoying the UI interface
55:36 - in in
55:38 - Adobe what was
55:39 - that adobe adob I don't know yeah Adobe
55:42 - Flash yeah Adobe Flash yeah they renamed
55:45 - it so my brain was was yeah Adobe Flash
55:48 - the the UI was really annoying in my
55:49 - personal opinion and I had already had
55:51 - game maker experience so I just
55:52 - preferred game maker but yeah well um um
55:56 - maybe you can talk about like the game
55:58 - development meta so to speak like
56:00 - like who is working on games like are
56:05 - are is it mostly hobbyist are there like
56:07 - hardcore game devs out there that like
56:10 - like like how would you describe the
56:12 - typical game developer in terms of like
56:15 - how they're approaching getting games
56:17 - done I saw the the documentary Indie G
56:20 - Indie Dev uh indie game yeah that was
56:23 - pretty good but I've heard like mixed
56:25 - things from actual game developers about
56:26 - like how representative it is of the
56:28 - typical Game Dev experience and things
56:30 - like that and obviously all three of
56:31 - those games were pretty popular
56:33 - successful in G so it's already kind of
56:35 - like uh showing like a little bit of
56:38 - selection bias survivorship bias I guess
56:41 - uh I I imagine like most projects most
56:43 - don't go anywhere right they probably
56:45 - don't even get completed it's rare that
56:47 - people even finish projects that they
56:48 - start right but like maybe you could
56:50 - talk about like what your how would you
56:53 - describe like a typical game developers
56:55 - lifestyle and and where they hang out
56:57 - like whether that's Discord whether
56:59 - that's um like local kind of game
57:02 - developer hacker space type places maybe
57:06 - you could just give me an idea of you
57:08 - know the the devs that you've come
57:10 - across and you've worked alongside and
57:12 - maybe give us a little more context in
57:14 - your
57:15 - process um do you mind refining the
57:18 - question a bit more yeah absolutely that
57:19 - was like 15 questions in
57:21 - one what do game devs do Daya what's the
57:26 - typical day in the life of a Game
57:28 - Dev yeah so I think like most things
57:31 - there's a lot of variation right and as
57:34 - game development has got more and more
57:36 - accessible I think the variation has
57:38 - only increased so like I know people
57:41 - that are they like game development is
57:43 - their full-time job right they've
57:45 - released some games to some audiences
57:46 - that love to play their games they
57:48 - charge them for it and they can pay the
57:50 - bills that way right I know game
57:52 - developers that you know they're
57:54 - habitually making a game count in it
57:56 - making a game canceling it making a game
57:58 - cancel it right I know game developers
57:59 - that are always looking for funding
58:02 - right they are going up to investors
58:04 - saying like hey I have this idea will
58:06 - you please give me money to make it
58:07 - right and I know game developers that
58:09 - just do the YouTube thing right there's
58:11 - a lot of
58:12 - variation um but I will say thank you I
58:16 - will say that I think the the
58:18 - commonality between them all is that a
58:20 - lot of them have like a a lot of passion
58:22 - for making games and and telling stories
58:24 - and uh
58:26 - you know trying to present something
58:28 - cool and creative to an audience yeah
58:31 - what what are some I think the most
58:33 - important thing if you are trying to be
58:35 - a game developer that can actually ship
58:36 - games is scope you have to learn scope
58:42 - uh I think that's top of the funnel next
58:43 - up is Passion focus on games that you
58:47 - you yourself want to
58:49 - play and then after that I would say is
58:52 - audience try toate games for existing
58:55 - audiences
58:57 - um I think if you pair all those three
58:58 - things together you will have a lot of
59:01 - games under your belt which which and
59:03 - and I want to emphasize how important it
59:05 - is to actually ship games I think it's
59:08 - fun to like habitually explore new
59:10 - Concepts and whatnot but shipping games
59:13 - is what you get critiqued on you don't
59:14 - get get critiqued on you know how well
59:18 - you can Implement a pathf finding
59:20 - algorithm you know what I mean yeah that
59:23 - makes total sense so just uh to recap
59:26 - scope passion for what you're building
59:28 - and having an existing audience not
59:30 - having to like Forge out in the wild for
59:32 - people that are interested in your
59:33 - completely novel game um but can you
59:36 - describe scope like and maybe how you
59:39 - Scope things and and where scope creeps
59:41 - maybe just start by defining
59:45 - scope
59:47 - yeah uh so so scope is the hardest one
59:50 - because it does require
59:51 - some like prior knowledge
59:54 - on what whatever you're building right
59:56 - like so if I'm building a game that
59:58 - requires pathf finding I have to have
60:00 - some knowledge on like the domain of
60:02 - pathf finding to be able to scope it um
60:05 - and pathfinding is like like having an
60:08 - AI kind of like go around in certain
60:11 - paths is it that literally it like just
60:13 - programming NPCs and stuff yeah
60:15 - non-player yeah yeah yeah um so so yeah
60:20 - scope is the hardest because again you
60:22 - need you need to some you need to have
60:24 - some understanding of the domain
60:26 - of whatever you're implementing but it's
60:28 - not impossible to get that information
60:30 - right there's so many resources
60:31 - everywhere you know especially in
60:35 - 2024 but yeah so can you give me an
60:38 - example of a time that you like maybe
60:42 - made scope too broad and scope is like
60:44 - like just basically focusing on a few
60:46 - key game elements or focusing on like
60:49 - what the goals of the project are you
60:51 - know it's easy to think like oh I'm
60:52 - going to create an open world game and
60:53 - it's going to of XYZ and like you know
60:55 - you look at like Cy Punk uh
60:58 - 2077 I can't remember the exact year but
61:00 - like that is a game that had so much
61:03 - scope creep that it ruined the game if
61:04 - they just not made it open world or if
61:06 - they' not tried to add all these
61:08 - different attributes and stuff like they
61:10 - they they got too big for their britches
61:12 - right they they leaned out farther than
61:14 - they they should have in in terms of you
61:16 - know the scope and right yeah and scope
61:19 - can prevent a project from ever getting
61:21 - done because the the scope can keep
61:23 - expanding as an excuse to not actually
61:25 - ship like as a procrastination you know
61:28 - excuse right yeah yeah 100% yeah so so
61:33 - has there been an instance that you can
61:34 - recall where you're like you you're like
61:37 - you know I think I've I've gone outside
61:39 - of my original scope or I I've I've made
61:42 - some sort of error when it comes to
61:43 - scope and I need to correct
61:45 - it it's a problem that I used to have a
61:47 - lot but developing for a YouTube channel
61:51 - it teaches you Scope really quickly
61:54 - because you have a regular schedule of
61:56 - releases like I've only got two months
61:58 - to build this game or like what's your
61:59 - release schedule do you have a fixed
62:02 - schedule yeah every I have to upload one
62:05 - video within 30 days of the last video
62:07 - that's what I operate off of okay it can
62:10 - be seven days it can be 12 days but I
62:12 - can't go more than 30 days okay that's a
62:14 - great rule to live by so that guides
62:17 - like for example I have to publish a
62:19 - podcast every Friday I have to send out
62:21 - an email newsletter every Friday right
62:23 - like so like those things force me to be
62:26 - to myself and the rules I put in place
62:28 - so I love how you have that very simple
62:30 - rule you know I can create videos as
62:33 - frequently as I want but it doesn't
62:34 - matter how many I've published I still
62:36 - need to have one within 30 days of the
62:37 - last one yeah yeah that's really cool
62:40 - it's like like uh yeah so so come full
62:44 - circle so like that that process it
62:46 - really has taught me a lot about scope
62:49 - right because it's it's one thing to be
62:51 - like I want to make this game where I
62:54 - have all my my subscribers connect to a
62:57 - server and they can walk around the
62:58 - world and drive cars like that's one
63:00 - thing right but then just having done
63:03 - this for so long I can have a good idea
63:05 - on like okay how long is it going to
63:06 - take me how many hours I investing if I
63:09 - start this video project in January am I
63:12 - going to finish it in in March or is it
63:14 - going to take me February of next year
63:16 - you know and it's something it's a skill
63:18 - that you have to hone I'm not going to
63:20 - sit here and say that it's easy but it's
63:22 - definitely something that I encourage
63:24 - everyone to pay attention to and try and
63:26 - home you know yeah so one of the things
63:29 - I want to ask is for people that are
63:32 - listening and they're interested in
63:34 - going into game development maybe they
63:35 - have some basic programming chops maybe
63:37 - they've completed cs50 they've gone
63:39 - they've earned a few free codam
63:41 - certifications they have a basic
63:43 - understanding of you know maybe python
63:45 - JavaScript uh maybe they haven't worked
63:47 - with unity yet but you know it sounds
63:49 - like that's a tool you would encourage
63:51 - people to pick up um so let's say
63:54 - hypothetically um they want to be a Game
63:57 - Dev two years from now they want to have
63:59 - a game life or do they even need two
64:01 - years like like what would you do if you
64:03 - starting over with everything you know
64:04 - today but you didn't have the skills you
64:06 - have today you didn't have the network
64:09 - that you have today in terms of like
64:10 - distribution being able to just publish
64:11 - a video on YouTube and have thousands of
64:12 - people see it like what would you do I
64:16 - love this question yes 100%
64:20 - listen
64:21 - nowadays is one of the most like
64:25 - accessible times we've ever lived in for
64:28 - anything and everything if I had to
64:31 - start over given the prompt you just
64:34 - gave I would first of all make a mobile
64:39 - game I would
64:41 - do active
64:42 - development so make an MVP that's
64:46 - minimal viable product yeah mhm launch
64:50 - the
64:51 - MVP start collecting feedback
64:54 - immediately whoever you can get the
64:56 - hands on your mom your brother your
64:59 - coworker whoever it
65:00 - is we have platforms like Tik Tok that
65:05 - you can easily reach an audience if you
65:07 - just learn how the like the different
65:09 - ways to game the system Instagram reals
65:12 - YouTube shorts like these are all
65:14 - platforms that have millions and
65:17 - millions of people watching a ton of
65:19 - content in a short period of
65:21 - time so that's what I would do and and
65:26 - and in fact that's what I'm doing for
65:27 - Ultra bouts all those things I just
65:29 - described I think that is the modernday
65:34 - developer and there's a lot of money to
65:36 - be made you know if you do this as well
65:38 - you know it's add model and if your game
65:41 - is good enough it connects with the
65:42 - audience good enough you can do inapp
65:44 - purchases yeah awesome so that would be
65:46 - your your advice if I can re summarize
65:49 - it is just build an MVP as quickly as
65:52 - possible get it out there start
65:53 - iterating and publicize it through short
65:56 - videos the short video format that is
65:59 - taking over YouTube For Better or Worse
66:01 - um and like of course you know like uh
66:03 - you know potentially programming our
66:05 - kids to be like extremely uh you know um
66:08 - sensitive to their physical appearance
66:10 - right um things like that right so sure
66:12 - sure we don't talk about that can yeah
66:15 - can I add one more caveat yeah last
66:17 - thing I want to add to that is really
66:19 - important is no one to quit no when to
66:21 - quit okay tell me about no one to quit
66:23 - no when to quit I'm taking
66:26 - notes so if you do all these things and
66:30 - you see that like no one's really
66:31 - responding no one really cares about
66:33 - your MVP or update 3 whatever it is you
66:37 - have to realize that maybe you just did
66:39 - not create a product that has a good
66:42 - Market
66:43 - fit and move on to the next one it's sad
66:47 - sometimes it sucks but it all depends on
66:49 - what you're looking for if you're
66:50 - looking to actually be a game developer
66:52 - that you can get Awards and all these
66:54 - accolades and pay your bills
66:56 - knowing when to quit is very important
66:58 - and it it's hard when we talk about like
67:01 - art but the truth of the matter is
67:04 - nowadays we have a completely different
67:07 - system you can't it's much harder
67:10 - for you to be the
67:13 - artist wait hold on let me let me
67:16 - rephrase that yeah nowadays it's more
67:19 - expected that you not only just the
67:21 - artist or the sound designer or the
67:24 - programmer you're all you weren't all
67:25 - hats now right once upon a time you can
67:29 - go work for a company and just play that
67:31 - role and have someone else figure out
67:32 - when to quit right but now you wear all
67:36 - the hats and you have to you know put on
67:37 - your business hat
67:38 - and you know pay attention to things so
67:41 - the brutal suit that's within you the uh
67:43 - the the pointy haired boss right the uh
67:46 - the the person who has to you know make
67:48 - the cold calculated business decision
67:52 - that person is the same as the creative
67:55 - genius who's like scrolling all over the
67:57 - Whiteboard with all these game ideas you
67:59 - have to be both if you want to succeed
68:02 - if if you want to succeed if you want to
68:04 - do it as a hobby you can do whatever you
68:05 - want but yeah I find that to be like the
68:07 - biggest thing that a lot of my game of
68:09 - offer friends fail to realize is that as
68:12 - much as this is an art medium and like
68:14 - we want to use it for artistic means
68:17 - what is art if no one ever engages with
68:19 - it you
68:21 - know yeah and I mean there are probably
68:23 - lots of people who think oh maybe some
68:25 - like historian is going to appreciate
68:28 - you know my game the way that van Go's
68:30 - art was only appreciated after he shot
68:32 - himself in the chest with a revolver and
68:34 - like years had passed and people just oh
68:36 - who's this V go guy right like but that
68:39 - is extremely unlikely for every van go
68:42 - there's
68:43 - probably thousands tens of thousands
68:46 - hundreds of thousands of artists who
68:48 - just died in obscurity and are still
68:50 - obscure right so it's a dice roll yeah
68:52 - so so I mean uh sounds like you've taken
68:55 - a very pragmatic approach toward game
68:58 - development
68:59 - um one thing that I want to talk about
69:01 - is distribution so we talked about like
69:03 - um the role of you know Tik Tok YouTube
69:06 - shorts Instagram
69:08 - reals there's this saying that like
69:10 - firsttime Founders focus on technology
69:13 - second time Founders focus on
69:15 - distribution how how do you distribute
69:19 - your game how do you get it in front of
69:20 - people obviously you talked about short
69:22 - firm video but but like what are the
69:24 - other ways that you distribute your game
69:27 - and like like are you using App Stores
69:29 - are you um do you have a mailing list
69:32 - are you like how do you get it your game
69:34 - out there and get people playing it I
69:36 - think I've came to a realization not too
69:37 - long ago that all of my games moving
69:40 - forward are going to be on the App
69:42 - Store and this is Apple and and Google
69:45 - App Store correct correct and the reason
69:49 - why is
69:50 - [Music]
69:52 - because it just matches so much with
69:56 - kind of my business model as it already
69:58 - is like a lot of people come to my
70:00 - YouTube channel and they watch my videos
70:01 - for free and then you know a small
70:04 - percentage they'll donate or they'll buy
70:05 - merch right but the majority in whole
70:08 - they expect free
70:10 - content
70:12 - and this is what the app stores are
70:17 - predominantly operated on it's like free
70:19 - apps and so I found that it's just a
70:22 - good fit where if I make free videos and
70:25 - I I I'm really lucky that I have an
70:27 - audience that I can make content for
70:29 - right like I have my own audience that I
70:31 - can show ads to I don't have to pay
70:33 - anyone right right which I'll get into
70:36 - that a little bit but in a little bit
70:40 - but just to wrap this Sor I have so
70:42 - many put all together I'm excited I'm
70:44 - taking
70:45 - notes um so so so again so the business
70:49 - model I've been operating on for a long
70:50 - time is free videos is what people
70:51 - expect so it only makes sense that like
70:53 - hey here's a free video also here's a
70:55 - free app that you can play in the
70:56 - meantime while you wait for the next
70:58 - video right and the reason why I think
71:02 - that the App Store themselves are good
71:04 - is because they promote apps based on
71:07 - their
71:08 - performance of people playing it of
71:11 - people downloading it Etc versus you
71:13 - look at some other stores like Steam for
71:14 - example they promote apps based on how
71:17 - they
71:18 - sell you see so there's a bit of a
71:20 - disconnect on my current business model
71:24 - and how Steam Works
71:26 - not saying it's impossible to make a
71:27 - successful game um from your YouTube
71:30 - audience but it just makes more sense
71:31 - that I have a free app that I can send
71:35 - my audience to and funneling traffic to
71:41 - my
71:42 - app is measured uh is is a key
71:45 - performance indicator for these app
71:47 - stores to then push it even further so
71:49 - it's just like extra boost if you will
71:50 - okay interesting so so essentially
71:52 - external traffic to an app uh will give
71:55 - like like Google's app store or Apple's
71:58 - App Store and their like top app
72:00 - leaderboard of the week and all that
72:01 - stuff like you can get a lot of
72:03 - additional juice out of like maybe the
72:05 - same number of people just because of
72:07 - the type of traffic that's coming to the
72:10 - app and if it's external that's
72:12 - interesting to note okay yeah I didn't
72:14 - know that and and the thing is like I
72:15 - don't even need someone to play the game
72:17 - more than an hour you know all I need is
72:19 - the download and then the app stores
72:20 - pick that up and they say okay there's
72:22 - some interest here we're going to
72:23 - promote this to people who don't even
72:24 - know who J Bros is
72:25 - you know yeah you say more than an hour
72:28 - because steam you you can get a refund
72:31 - if you play it less than a certain
72:32 - amount of time right so a lot of people
72:33 - refund it yeah yeah sorry I didn't mean
72:35 - to interrupt your flow they can well
72:37 - well I mean look that's actually another
72:38 - good point as well right like I think
72:40 - it's eight hours if you play before 8
72:43 - hours you get a refund which means that
72:45 - you have to create a game that has more
72:47 - than eight hours of content which is not
72:50 - easy you know and if you're you're if
72:54 - you're a full-time content
72:56 - Creator and you're trying to launch a
72:59 - game on Steam you need to make a game
73:01 - that has more than eight hours of
73:03 - confident so that people don't game the
73:05 - system and get their money back right
73:06 - you
73:08 - know again I'm not saying that it's bad
73:10 - I'm not saying launching games on steams
73:11 - is bad I just think that launching games
73:13 - on in app store is just far more optimal
73:16 - for the business model of a content
73:17 - creator uh like a YouTube content
73:19 - creator yeah interesting so uh not to
73:23 - mention the accessibility as well yeah
73:25 - accessibility one thing I learned one
73:27 - thing I learned transitioning to doing
73:29 - mobile apps is how simple it is for
73:31 - people to play the app I used to do
73:34 - Steam games and there would be so many
73:36 - different things oh I need a coordinate
73:37 - a time oh is it is it this system or
73:40 - that system oh my PC specs aren't good
73:42 - enough right when I've been doing mobile
73:44 - apps I've doing play testing I say hey
73:46 - here's the app link in three minutes
73:48 - they have it downloaded ready to play I
73:50 - mean you've even done some live streams
73:51 - where you're like here download this app
73:52 - and like let's play it and like those
73:54 - streams are great like your who's the AI
73:56 - game I can't remember the exact name
73:58 - yeah yeah where you got like video
73:59 - coming soon yeah so different um
74:04 - different ideas like that you can
74:06 - iterate on them so quickly and your
74:08 - audience can get into the game and once
74:09 - they've played one game that like breaks
74:11 - a barrier where they're like okay next
74:13 - time he's doing a live stream I'm going
74:14 - to download the game and interact right
74:15 - there these multiplayer games so cool so
74:19 - uh let's say hypothetically you didn't
74:20 - have the uh YouTube following that you
74:24 - have how would you dist your game would
74:25 - you still stick mostly to the App
74:28 - Stores yeah I think app stores is the
74:32 - best way to go in terms of
74:34 - someone I don't know I I'm still
74:36 - thinking about like app stores versus
74:39 - steam yeah like this is a relatively new
74:41 - discovery for me I'm still thinking
74:42 - about it but at this moment I feel that
74:45 - app stores are they are the future there
74:48 - are limitations you can't really create
74:50 - every experience with an app but I think
74:52 - you can create most experiences with an
74:54 - app and and the reason why I would
74:57 - suggest someone who doesn't have an
74:58 - audience to use an app store is because
75:00 - you have a greater probability of
75:02 - getting promoted with on the App Stores
75:06 - literally the the key performance
75:08 - indicator for steam is sales yeah so if
75:11 - you don't have an audience already you
75:13 - make a game you put up on Steam and you
75:15 - don't get any sales you're just not
75:16 - going to get seen yeah but if you can if
75:20 - you publish an app on Google Play or the
75:22 - app store or the Apple App Store and you
75:24 - create a Tik Tok or something and the
75:26 - Tik Tok gets some traction and you get
75:28 - people to go download your game that is
75:29 - a key performance indicator that will be
75:31 - looked at and you will get extra
75:32 - promotion so it it just makes sense you
75:35 - know yeah okay I think yeah that's
75:36 - really that explains why a lot of the
75:37 - most Innovative games I've seen are on
75:39 - mobile formats even though a lot of
75:42 - Hardcore Gamers cringe and bristle at
75:44 - the notion of playing a game on their
75:45 - phone when they've got like you know a
75:47 - $2,000 PC with like a fancy graphics
75:49 - card and they got like all their
75:50 - ergonomic stuff set up at their desk so
75:54 - moving on from distribution I want to
75:56 - talk about like game design as a field
76:00 - and one of the things that's so
76:01 - interesting to me is like the games
76:03 - you're developing are very different
76:05 - from other games uh like almost like
76:09 - genre Less in a way or like if there is
76:11 - a genre it's very you know specific like
76:14 - I we we saw the rise of lots of
76:16 - different genres of games such as like
76:18 - Tower Defense games for example or um
76:22 - you know like obviously realtime
76:23 - strategy games have been around for long
76:24 - a long time but before video games
76:27 - reached a certain level of
76:28 - sophistication the notion of a real-time
76:30 - strategy game where you controlled a
76:31 - whole lot of different units and a whole
76:33 - lot you were like making so many
76:34 - decisions like that had to come from
76:37 - somewhere right first-person shooters uh
76:39 - like like Doom had to come from
76:41 - somewhere and they came from the idea of
76:44 - from the mind of a few developers
76:46 - probably sketching things out on
76:47 - whiteboards probably building really
76:49 - coarse prototypes right even sides
76:51 - scrollers like the original rcade games
76:54 - had the strength that they couldn't
76:55 - scroll because it was too graphically
76:57 - intensive now you can I mean I want to
77:00 - say you can do basically anything with
77:02 - the computational power of like an
77:03 - iPhone or an Android like do you think
77:06 - we'll ever exhaust the design space for
77:09 - games and interactive
77:12 - experiences no I don't think
77:16 - so I so there's a game that came out not
77:19 - too long ago
77:21 - it's um I don't remember the name of it
77:25 - but it it meshes two genres together two
77:27 - relatively new genres together
77:30 - and even that I'm like we're never going
77:34 - to run out of ideas like there there's
77:36 - so many genres that you can take to this
77:38 - day and and just do one plus one and get
77:40 - two like to this day there's so much
77:42 - unexplored and we we are still creating
77:45 - new genres as the years go on so I don't
77:48 - think that we will you know you yeah I I
77:51 - can go on but I'll stop there okay and
77:53 - like so how do you how did you come up
77:55 - with the idea of having a turn-based
77:58 - fighting game cuz of course there's like
78:01 - Pokemon there are lots of like
78:02 - collectible card games and stuff like
78:03 - that there are lots of games that are
78:05 - turn-based uh like board games basically
78:07 - anything in the tabletop world is
78:09 - necessarily almost turn-based just
78:10 - because otherwise you'd have people like
78:12 - throwing their hands all over the table
78:14 - and stuff yeah how did you come up with
78:17 - this particular idea because people
78:18 - think about you know Tekken they think
78:19 - about Street Fighter they think about
78:21 - games that uh require like frame perfect
78:24 - inputs and stuff like that like what
78:26 - inspired you to go on this this route
78:29 - thank you for asking this
78:31 - question I have immense passion for uh
78:35 - this game this turn based fighting game
78:37 - then I'm making Ultra BS uh because it
78:40 - it mixes everything that I've kind of
78:43 - learned over the last like 15 years in
78:46 - the sense of design and the sense of
78:48 - code and sense of so many different
78:50 - things Graphics Etc but the to answer a
78:52 - question directly I've always been a
78:54 - huge fan of
78:55 - anime and I've played many anime games
78:58 - over the years but I've never been
79:00 - really satisfied with the anime games
79:02 - that I play because you watch like Goku
79:05 - versus Vegeta right in Dragon Ball Z and
79:08 - you see them doing some incredible
79:11 - things that you just wish you could do
79:13 - but then you go play a game and they
79:15 - have to limit you because you're playing
79:17 - a game in real time with the controller
79:19 - with a limited amount of inputs
79:22 - right and so having the desire to want
79:26 - to like really feel like
79:29 - Goku but also uh coming off of a chess
79:32 - addiction that I had
79:35 - yeah I realized that and I I I'm still
79:38 - exploring this Beyond Ultra bers I
79:40 - realized
79:42 - that I think that some of the the
79:45 - greatest experiences we have yet to
79:48 - experience are ditching real time
79:52 - simulation and inste in in favor of like
79:55 - a like a turn base or a frame by frame
79:57 - simulation yeah and frame by frame maybe
79:59 - you can describe verbally like so you're
80:01 - doing like a show ruken or something and
80:03 - it's like frame by frame it's like okay
80:06 - what would you like to do at this step
80:07 - like and so you can alter like you know
80:10 - all different aspects of like the combat
80:13 - experience and you can kind of adapt to
80:15 - strategies it presents like this
80:17 - multifaceted whereas like okay I threw a
80:20 - punch and they threw a punch and my
80:21 - punch has higher priority or my punch
80:23 - comes out in eight frames they're comes
80:24 - out in 10 frames so I win and then they
80:27 - there's nothing they can do once that
80:29 - button's been pressed and so many
80:31 - decisions in these you know real- time
80:33 - fighting games like fighting games
80:35 - because they're all real time basically
80:37 - like they happen at like a the level
80:39 - like the human threshold for reaction
80:41 - time I think is like a quarter of a
80:43 - second right like if you have like you
80:44 - go to the Science Museum and they've got
80:46 - the the magnet thing and it holds the
80:47 - ruler and it drops it and you have to
80:49 - grab it and it like I tried it so many
80:51 - times I could never really get below the
80:53 - quarter of a second threshold M the
80:56 - games happen faster so you have to kind
80:58 - of like input and you have to come up
80:59 - with humanistics like oh I'm going to
81:01 - throw this and this and you kind of
81:03 - develop an intuition but you can't
81:04 - actually react to what's happening it's
81:06 - right it's kind of physiologically
81:08 - impossible to really react you know you
81:11 - you might be able to memorize exactly
81:12 - how to Parry you know like Chun ley's
81:15 - special or something like that to where
81:16 - you can Parry every single hit of it or
81:18 - something like that right but you're not
81:20 - going to be able to uh adapt your
81:23 - gameplay in real time and it sounds like
81:25 - what you're building gives you the
81:26 - opportunity to consider all those things
81:28 - and and it lets you step back and
81:30 - deliberate like a real time chess
81:32 - experience would be extremely boring
81:34 - watching two grand Masters sit at the
81:37 - table and think really hard for 15
81:39 - minutes and make a move right like the
81:40 - chess clocks are like nine hours in some
81:42 - games right yeah but at the same time
81:45 - it's incredibly engaging if you're the
81:47 - person who's at the chest table looking
81:49 - at the game trying to decide what to
81:51 - do yeah also replays I I was really
81:54 - addicted to watching chess replays
81:56 - there's uh I think Gotham chess he does
81:58 - like his YouTube channel does a bunch of
82:00 - uh replay commentary on like really
82:03 - famous matches and it was so enthralling
82:04 - to me but I I realized that it's not
82:07 - going to be enthralling to everyone like
82:09 - you have to have an understanding of
82:10 - Chess to some degree and you know it's
82:12 - really plain Graphics um yeah there's so
82:15 - many things that came together for the
82:17 - ultra BS project I remember I was going
82:18 - to do a video a few years ago about um a
82:22 - concept in The Matrix right so you think
82:24 - about the Matrix
82:25 - you think what what would it take if we
82:27 - had the ability to dodge bullets right
82:30 - and the truth of the matter is you just
82:32 - would have to have a much
82:35 - uh a
82:37 - much larger iteration of time uh
82:41 - perception right in terms of like one
82:44 - yeah like one second you need to be able
82:46 - to perceive much faster right and I was
82:49 - going to make this video where you could
82:52 - put on a VR and and you would get shot
82:56 - by an
82:57 - agent and then I would calculate the
82:59 - trajectory that it's going and then just
83:02 - skip the time so that it puts it right
83:05 - in front of you so you get to react to
83:06 - it but then the the person who shot the
83:08 - gun sees you dodging it so yeah so they
83:12 - they can quickly adapt to where you are
83:13 - and like triangulate where they think
83:15 - you're going to go and shoot in that
83:16 - direction we're talking about the 1990 n
83:19 - classic The Matrix if anybody listening
83:21 - to this has not seen that movie I I mean
83:23 - it is literally my favorite movie I'm
83:26 - not exaggerating I've watched lots of
83:27 - movies I I think it's the most creative
83:31 - interesting like it holds up really well
83:34 - uh even today in 2024 but but sorry for
83:37 - the the segue like and the plot is
83:39 - surprisingly deep if you watch the
83:41 - entire Trilogy are the machines actually
83:43 - bad think about it you know U but uh but
83:47 - to get to your point like the the
83:49 - ability to adapt and then have your
83:51 - opponent adapt and like there there's
83:54 - there also kind of like the metag gaming
83:55 - like conventionally people will do this
83:57 - so like they can recognize the strategy
83:59 - and they can develop heuristics to be
84:00 - able to make decisions again the sort of
84:03 - stuff that like maybe an extremely high
84:05 - level fighting game player already does
84:08 - but they do it almost intuitively after
84:10 - thousands of hours of practice what if
84:11 - you just picking up this game could
84:14 - start to have that that kind of push and
84:15 - pull that interplay that's the exact
84:18 - point of ultra bers is you no longer
84:21 - need that thousand hours like here we're
84:23 - going to give it to you step by step so
84:25 - you can you can take all the time you
84:27 - need to evaluate the game State yeah you
84:29 - know yeah it sounds so cool man and uh
84:32 - you mentioned anime I'm just going to
84:34 - jump to that man like what inspired you
84:36 - a game developer to create anime to
84:40 - Japanese animation style uh you know
84:43 - cartoons
84:45 - essentially
84:47 - uh that's great question I I personally
84:49 - think that a lot of the best stories
84:52 - come from anime um
84:56 - I can't like I think a lot of the
84:58 - stories that have resonated with me to
85:00 - this day are like all anime stories from
85:02 - Cowboy bbop to to Big O to Dragon Ball
85:06 - like they're all anime stories and
85:10 - I came to a point where I wanted to tell
85:12 - my own story and I thought what better
85:15 - medium than to create a create an anime
85:17 - it's still in in progress It's in manga
85:20 - form at the moment but we we'll get to
85:21 - it eventually awesome corre you hiring
85:23 - to develop the you're actually artist
85:25 - and I took this the tofu car that is
85:28 - like the star of the uh of the show and
85:31 - I just was like Hey can you can you do
85:32 - something similar about me holding my
85:34 - bass playing like kind of like leaning
85:36 - against the car so that's the cover of
85:38 - the uh the uh learn to code RPG
85:40 - soundtrack thing but um nice nice but
85:43 - I've worked with artists and they're not
85:45 - that expensive at least the ones like
85:47 - it's amazing like uh you you can find
85:50 - artists who really take pride in their
85:52 - craft you can support them in their
85:54 - craft and you can get them to uh
85:57 - essentially develop art based on your
86:00 - prompt if you will like you've been
86:02 - doing that right you've been working
86:03 - with artists correct correct and it's
86:07 - been quite the journey I um you know
86:11 - before I did any of this I was like yeah
86:12 - usually I just go and tell someone who I
86:15 - think is talented to make some art and
86:17 - they do it but yeah you know they're
86:19 - individuals they're also entrepreneurs
86:21 - you know they have their own schedules
86:23 - and timelines and projects and dreams
86:25 - and aspirations and you know some are
86:27 - better than others unfortunately but I
86:30 - am lucky to have found a good group of
86:32 - artists that I am able to work really
86:35 - well with and they do really talented
86:37 - work
86:38 - and learned a lot yeah so you so you
86:40 - write and you come up with the
86:41 - characters and kind of like figure out
86:43 - what's correct what you want to relay to
86:47 - to the reader or eventually the viewer
86:49 - and then they help you execute on that
86:51 - through their skills correct correct I
86:54 - do all the writing character design all
86:56 - that stuff and uh there's a bit of a
86:58 - compromise you know when you when you
87:00 - bring anyone on any project right like
87:02 - they have their own fair share of say
87:05 - into the content just by the nature of
87:07 - their art style and the way they
87:09 - interpret things but you know it's part
87:12 - of the collaborative process so I I
87:13 - don't mind it so how would you how would
87:15 - you compare working with human artists
87:17 - to working with you know Frameworks that
87:20 - you're developing games on and stuff
87:21 - because as a as an indie Dev you're kind
87:23 - of like
87:24 - doing everything Soup To Nuts Lock Stock
87:26 - and Barrel right like you're you you're
87:29 - kind of doing I don't know if you
87:30 - actually develop your own assets but
87:32 - like maybe you could talk about like
87:35 - just how many different hats you wear
87:38 - when you're building a game versus you
87:40 - know collaborating with humans for
87:43 - art it's it's a lesson that I'm learning
87:47 - uh how to do
87:48 - less wear less of the hats
87:51 - yeah um once upon a time I I had this
87:54 - belief that you not a real creative if
87:57 - you didn't do the whole thing
87:59 - yourself once upon a time I believe that
88:01 - but I have I think actually thanks to
88:04 - the manga project and working with
88:06 - artists because I had no other option to
88:08 - because I can't draw it is taught me a
88:10 - lot of it has showed me like the value
88:14 - of working with people and so Ultra bout
88:16 - is actually it has I have a 3D modeler
88:18 - shout outs to my boy colossal cake he's
88:20 - doing the 3D models on that they look
88:22 - beautiful far better than anything I
88:23 - could ever do
88:26 - and I sorry I forgot the question you
88:28 - said oh yeah like what hats would you
88:30 - wear as a Game Dev versus now you're
88:32 - just writing and kind of directing I
88:34 - guess yeah yeah back then it's
88:37 - everything design it's code it's art
88:39 - it's sound it's music it's it's writing
88:42 - it's it's everything you know character
88:43 - design it's it's everything and I and
88:47 - you know what's interesting is that I
88:49 - think that's part of the reason why
88:51 - scope is so difficult is because like
88:54 - you have to do everything and and now
88:56 - that I've relinquished the art to an
88:58 - artist colossal cake for Ultra bers
89:00 - that's just one less thing that I have
89:01 - to worry about right so now I can I have
89:04 - this I have this uh like this this group
89:08 - of things that is like a
89:10 - little less heavy with the art remove
89:13 - that I can put more time into and help
89:17 - me scope things correctly awesome well I
89:19 - want to talk a little bit about AI
89:22 - That's like the thing that everybody
89:23 - talks about now uh there have been some
89:25 - really impressive advancements in AI
89:28 - recently we saw like Sora which is this
89:31 - uh um video creation tool put up by open
89:35 - AI um and of course we've got like image
89:38 - creation tools uh and we've got text
89:41 - creation tools you've used AI in a lot
89:44 - of your recent projects um let's talk a
89:47 - little bit about your relationship with
89:48 - AI and how you got how you like looked
89:51 - at it like this is ready for me to
89:53 - actually use it right because it's been
89:56 - around forever you know lots of people
89:58 - have developed things with AI over the
89:59 - past few years I mean you could argue
90:01 - that like game AI is as old as games
90:03 - themselves because otherwise there
90:05 - wouldn't be much of a game if the
90:07 - Pac-Man ghost just sat there right like
90:09 - yeah but what inspired you to pick up Ai
90:13 - and what are some of the things you've
90:15 - been building with
90:16 - it what inspired me to pick up AI once
90:19 - again this is a call back to the
90:20 - beginning of the podcast um I used to
90:22 - watch my mom play D Kong Country on
90:24 - Super Nintendo when I was young and
90:26 - again she had a controller and she was
90:28 - controlling Donkey Kong but there were
90:30 - agents that I I just was like who's
90:32 - controlling the agents who who who is
90:34 - controlling the the enemies the baddies
90:36 - and that like I think started my
90:38 - fascination with AI and wanting to learn
90:40 - more um so I get the game maker and I'm
90:43 - making a bunch of games and I'm learning
90:44 - how to do AI for the first time and once
90:48 - I learned how to do it well man I made
90:50 - so many games that like couldn't even
90:52 - play like I just said and watched it I
90:55 - had this one game quick side note that I
90:57 - made that was like anime shown in style
91:00 - bunch of Fighters they're in like an
91:01 - arena and I would just put it on and
91:03 - watch it as I fall
91:05 - asleep anyways that's cool I I
91:09 - eventually come across um Carl Sims um
91:12 - Evolution simulator uh demo thing and
91:15 - that really changed like my whole
91:17 - concept of what AI could be with their
91:19 - generative algorithm they was
91:20 - demonstrating obviously I had no idea
91:22 - how to do at the time but but that stuck
91:24 - in my brain for many many many many many
91:26 - years until finally I found unity and
91:30 - there's all these announcements about
91:32 - tensor flow you know which is a machine
91:34 - learning library yeah yeah and um uh now
91:39 - all of a sudden all these resources are
91:41 - available where I can learn back
91:42 - propagation and the various calculus
91:44 - things that I need and I spent eight
91:46 - months to learn all that stuff and then
91:48 - I make I basically try and make what
91:51 - Carl Sims made in his 1990 one demo I
91:54 - think it is um on YouTube and it worked
91:57 - it blew up
91:59 - and I've always had a Fascination for AI
92:02 - awesome I'll track down that Carl Sims
92:04 - demo and put it in the show notes for
92:06 - anybody who wants to watch it let's talk
92:08 - about some of the things you've built
92:09 - with it like I can't not talk about the
92:11 - amazing shark tank Shark Tank Episode
92:15 - generator uh this I was laughing like
92:19 - like practically rolling on the floor
92:21 - watching the video where you demoed some
92:22 - of it and and it's just the the show
92:25 - shark tank is so absurd for anybody who
92:27 - knows anything about business like even
92:29 - ad me administering a charity like the
92:31 - show is so absurd and ridiculous and
92:33 - it's not how real people invest the
92:35 - business advice
92:37 - like there might be some useful advice
92:39 - in there but it's it's hyper real
92:42 - reality TV right yeah so now imagine
92:45 - people are coming in with straight faces
92:47 - pitching things like underwear
92:49 - underwater shops for fish to shop at um
92:53 - I'm trying to remember some of the other
92:55 - ones but baby's first hand gun you know
92:58 - to absurd but they're coming in their
93:01 - they're do they're silent fire alarm
93:03 - yeah silent fire alarm like isn't it
93:05 - annoying when a fire alarm goes off
93:06 - silent fire alarm you know like pitching
93:08 - it as a product and having like the you
93:10 - know the cast of uh the Sharks I guess
93:12 - is what they're called like reacting to
93:14 - it like oh I'm out you know the
93:17 - cigarette that has 10x the nicotine or
93:20 - something like that yeah yeah like you
93:22 - you don't have to smoke as much cuz you
93:23 - get next ni easier on the ls right I
93:26 - mean and then uh I mean it sounds like
93:28 - something that would have been pitched
93:29 - at like the height of the ' 80s or
93:30 - something like that like but these are
93:33 - really amazing scripts and you've even
93:36 - kind of figured out like some rigging so
93:37 - that you can have like it a visual
93:39 - element to it like the the shark sitting
93:41 - back in their chair like their lips are
93:42 - moving as they talk and and the voices
93:44 - like GPT has probably read the
93:46 - transcripts of every single Shark Tank
93:47 - Episode ever so it can kind of almost
93:49 - nail the manner in which the Sharks
93:51 - would react to a given proposal if they
93:54 - were entertaining is is a serious
93:55 - proposal which none of these are yeah
93:57 - maybe you can talk about developing that
93:59 - and like what inspired you to develop
94:02 - that yeah I um I love shark tank it's a
94:06 - very entertaining show incredibly
94:07 - entertaining but you know kind of like
94:10 - what I touched on the video the best
94:11 - episodes of Shark Tank are the bad ideas
94:14 - those are always the most entertaining
94:16 - and it just came to me one day I was
94:18 - like well I want more Shark Tank
94:21 - episodes of bad ideas and I think we can
94:24 - make this happen with AI I think someone
94:26 - had asked me when I was talking to them
94:28 - about it like what if someone
94:30 - pitched it was some crazy idea and I was
94:33 - like that would be so funny and I think
94:35 - the initial idea was to just do it
94:36 - myself and I was like no no no we can
94:38 - make an AI algorithm to do this for us
94:40 - and so I started to develop
94:42 - it and funny enough I was actually going
94:44 - to stop at the 3D
94:46 - rendering but I remember showing it to
94:48 - someone they're like oh yeah this is
94:50 - cool I was like no what do you mean this
94:52 - is cool this is this is amazing
94:54 - and what I what I had figured out is
94:57 - that the idea itself was cool but the
94:59 - presentation was terrible in the video
95:01 - there's like a 3D model of the Sharks
95:04 - and it's like whatever presentation and
95:06 - so that's when I learned that like I
95:08 - need to take it further and so I got a
95:11 - bunch of different libraries to make
95:12 - them like the face driving and whatnot
95:14 - and then I showed that to the same
95:15 - person like oh I love this is amazing I
95:17 - want to see more right so rapidly
95:19 - iterating essentially uh as you got
95:22 - feedback and just thinking like hey I
95:24 - could use AI for this I'm sure a lot of
95:26 - developers are kind of like working on
95:28 - things and they're like wait a second I
95:29 - need to generate a whole lot of scripts
95:31 - and I don't want if I write them myself
95:32 - they probably won't be as funny as what
95:33 - GPT creates anyway yeah um because again
95:36 - it's read everything it's read every
95:38 - Reddit post it's read every book in the
95:41 - Library of Congress like it has the
95:42 - context to be able to come up with stuff
95:44 - and it's very useful in that regard so
95:47 - maybe we could talk a little bit about
95:50 - um Ai and what what you think is likely
95:54 - to disrupt you did a recent kind of tier
95:57 - list of jobs you think are likely to be
95:58 - disrupted by Ai and very controversial
96:02 - yeah yeah I'm sure it's controversial
96:03 - because I think a lot of people greatly
96:05 - overestimate the capability of AI and
96:08 - they see like this big step change and
96:09 - they think that like oh the next big
96:11 - step change is just around the corner
96:12 - and then next thing you know we're in
96:14 - like you know lawnmower man or something
96:16 - I don't know but maybe you could talk
96:18 - about like um your tier list and like
96:22 - EXC where you put different jobs and
96:24 - then what proved to be the most
96:28 - controversial all of it all of it's
96:30 - controversial apparently
96:33 - um yeah I I don't remember specifically
96:37 - a lot of them to be honest but I I do
96:39 - know that I got a comment like an hour
96:41 - ago of someone talking about how
96:42 - delusional I am thinking that factory
96:45 - workers won't be
96:46 - replaced and so I I replied to them and
96:49 - say okay just to make sure I understand
96:51 - what you're saying you're saying that
96:53 - the
96:54 - 200,000 Factory workers who work on the
96:56 - iPhone are going to be replaced within 5
96:57 - 10 years and then his reply was like
97:00 - well I think about 180,000 of them are
97:02 - going to be replaced in 51 years I'm
97:03 - just like how do we get here yeah how do
97:06 - we get here that is an absurd claim 51
97:09 - years 180,000 Factory workers will be
97:12 - replaced to make an iPhone like that
97:16 - that is so absurd yeah that is so absurd
97:18 - like when we get into like the actual
97:20 - economics of it it's like how much does
97:21 - that cost I was lucky enough I did a
97:23 - tour uh of one of Amazon's robot
97:26 - facilities and Amazon I think they have
97:29 - like a $ 1.6 trillion do market cap or
97:31 - something like that and they were
97:32 - showing us Rob robots that were in
97:35 - beta you know and this person is talking
97:37 - about we replace 180 it's just it's just
97:40 - crazy to me I don't know I don't I I I
97:42 - have an idea how we got here sci-fi is
97:44 - really appealing and you know oftentimes
97:47 - we don't even think too deeply about
97:48 - like the economics and actual effects of
97:50 - these things but you know yeah it is
97:52 - what it is I guess
97:55 - so do you think people greatly
97:57 - overestimate like like the the most
97:59 - common thing I hear the most common
98:00 - question I get an email about it people
98:02 - who've listened to more than one episode
98:03 - of the freeo camp podcast will no doubt
98:05 - be like oh quiz's going to talk about it
98:07 - again but I am because it's important
98:09 - people write me every single day hey
98:10 - should I still learn the code or is my
98:12 - job going to be completely automated and
98:15 - uh yeah what what would you say to to
98:17 - some whipper snapper who's like jail
98:20 - should I still learn Game Dev or is Game
98:21 - Dev just going to be automated in 5
98:23 - years
98:26 - um so I I do think that there is a
98:30 - probability that it will be automated at
98:32 - some point I think 51 years is too short
98:35 - of a time
98:36 - scale um I can get into why but before I
98:39 - do that before I do that I I again I
98:44 - always like to like ground these things
98:47 - and economics right if I am going to go
98:51 - make the next Facebook or what they call
98:54 - it meta or whatever they call
98:56 - it and I want to hire an AI to do my to
98:59 - be my full-time programmer right the
99:02 - real question is how much does that cost
99:04 - in API Keys like how much does it cost
99:08 - right now if I want a full team of AI
99:11 - programmers how much does that cost like
99:13 - these are real questions that we need to
99:14 - ask right and then furthermore right we
99:17 - can keep going if an AI um programmer
99:21 - makes a mistake like a fund Al
99:23 - foundational mistake within the code and
99:26 - doesn't report it who do we blame you
99:29 - know like there's so many questions that
99:31 - we need to explore that I think that
99:33 - we're so far away especially someone
99:35 - that's been working with these tools uh
99:37 - on a daily basis building actual
99:39 - products with it there's so many
99:40 - foundational errors not saying it can't
99:42 - get better but I I I think that there's
99:46 - an element
99:48 - of language that we as humans don't even
99:52 - understand
99:54 - and to
99:58 - see the
100:00 - um to see that understanding uh being
100:03 - implemented in these AI language models
100:06 - within the next 5 10 years when we don't
100:08 - even understand it I think it's a little
100:10 - absurd but yeah and what I think are the
100:14 - things that you've been most impressed
100:15 - by with tools like gbd4 that that you're
100:19 - like oh this is genuinely useful and
100:21 - this saved me a whole lot of time
100:24 - yeah don't get me wrong I think GPT Chad
100:27 - GPT is like one of the most foundational
100:29 - like amazing products of the last 30
100:32 - years I think it's amazing however I
100:35 - just always like to push back on like
100:37 - you guys think the show like it's it's
100:38 - it's not going to do all that the things
100:40 - that you think it's going to do at least
100:42 - not right now um but in terms of like
100:45 - what I use it for I use it for virtually
100:47 - everything man if I'm making a video I
100:48 - go asking for some advice uh if I am
100:52 - working on a game feature I'll ask it
100:54 - for advice or even code um if I'm having
100:57 - problems my relationship I'll ask for
100:59 - advice if there's some news article I'll
101:01 - say hey can you summarize this formula I
101:02 - use it for almost everything to be
101:04 - honest with you yeah and it improves
101:05 - your productivity your personal
101:06 - productivity and I think that's one of
101:08 - the things you struck at in the the
101:10 - video is it's going to improve the
101:12 - productivity of lawyers but it's not
101:14 - going to replace lawyers heaven forbid
101:17 - we have you I mean I can only imagine
101:20 - like all the you know lawsuits and all
101:22 - all the economic waste that would come
101:24 - from delegating that when you could just
101:26 - hire a lawyer who yes they're expensive
101:28 - but these are important decisions right
101:30 - um yeah yeah so very important to yeah
101:33 - and and I would say like you know a
101:35 - doctor a lawyer like I don't think that
101:37 - those jobs are like and I think software
101:39 - engineer is also in that category
101:40 - because software engineer makes a
101:41 - mistake and a plane falls out of the sky
101:44 - you know like yeah you're going to want
101:46 - actual people working on some of those
101:47 - things I guess the the main question I
101:49 - have for you is are the fields not
101:52 - complete replacement which was what your
101:53 - video was about but do you think that an
101:56 - individual developer could become so
101:59 - productive by leveraging all these tools
102:01 - that you just need fewer
102:04 - developers yeah I think that's
102:05 - definitely possible and I I would be
102:07 - surprised if it's not already happening
102:08 - to be honest um but I mean but I the
102:12 - question I always have is like what is
102:13 - that what is that saying and what are
102:16 - you trying to say not you personally
102:17 - coinci but like someone who make puts
102:19 - forward this argument are you saying
102:20 - that we should stop AI technology
102:22 - because it makes people more productive
102:24 - like that's not in the human Spirit you
102:26 - know we for a millennia have been
102:29 - creating tools to further our production
102:32 - right um I personally find arguments
102:35 - like that when we talk about
102:37 - displacement right instead of
102:39 - replacement I find that to be very
102:42 - telling on like the individual you know
102:45 - learn these tools man they're not that
102:47 - difficult you know yeah I mean in in my
102:49 - opinion tools are getting easier to
102:51 - learn every day like it's getting easier
102:52 - and easier to learn how to code for
102:54 - example to learn how to be a database
102:56 - administrator to learn how to do devops
102:59 - um yeah the tools are improving so I
103:01 - just want to wrap up with a few quick
103:03 - questions uh that I'm excited to ask you
103:07 - are you like inspired by like Hong Kong
103:09 - Kung Fu dubbing or something like why is
103:11 - it so many of your videos you're like
103:14 - hey how's it going you know like I love
103:17 - that it's so funny and I I I haven't
103:19 - seen any other creators do that is that
103:20 - common am I just missing out on like a
103:22 - genre of you know videos or is that
103:25 - distinctly
103:27 - you um I don't think I've came across
103:30 - any other creators that do that so just
103:31 - to describe it like verbally for for
103:34 - people that aren't watching the video
103:37 - like when you watch a ja video he'll be
103:40 - like eating pizza and like his voice
103:42 - sounds totally clear it doesn't sound
103:44 - like he's eating pizza but he's
103:45 - obviously eating pizza and like doing
103:47 - these very exaggerated movements and
103:49 - stuff it's so Charming uh and it's so
103:53 - there's like this weird kind of
103:54 - Disconnect but like I'm watching jabril
103:56 - but I'm not you know I'm listening to a
103:58 - different jbril like in a different time
104:00 - why doesn't he sync it up it it also
104:02 - seems like a huge time save because you
104:03 - can just just gesticulate and do
104:05 - whatever and then you can have that
104:06 - almost as like b-roll from when you're
104:08 - actually recording your fil your videos
104:10 - right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's yeah
104:14 - so the the inspiration for it before I
104:17 - used to make my videos uh like reading
104:20 - scripts like I would dead pan just read
104:22 - a script but it took so much time it
104:24 - took a lot of time retaking and I don't
104:27 - say a word properly and one day I was
104:30 - watching a video it was like some kid he
104:32 - was doing like a commentary with
104:34 - gameplay footage on screen I was like
104:37 - this is so brain dead simple why can't I
104:40 - do this I like wait I can do this you
104:43 - know except for I'm Just a Little More
104:45 - egotistical I need my face on screen so
104:47 - I just use my face in lie of the
104:50 - gameplay footage um but I don't do that
104:53 - anymore unfortunately it it it got to a
104:57 - point
104:58 - where it was like a highlight for a lot
105:01 - of people to the point where like I'm
105:03 - overthinking so many takes and it ended
105:06 - up taking a lot more time than it used
105:07 - to so I kind of I found a new way that's
105:10 - faster to make videos yeah I get
105:12 - comments every single day what's your
105:13 - new faster way just out of
105:15 - curiosity yeah so my my latest way is I
105:18 - will go on uh green screen and just
105:20 - basically just Rift
105:23 - yeah just just start going basically
105:26 - yeah just just Rift I'll have like
105:27 - bullet points on what I want to touch on
105:29 - but I'll just Rift in front of a green
105:30 - screen yeah uh and then I'll I'll film
105:33 - clips here and there throughout the
105:34 - process uh just doing like commentary
105:36 - that I can play if need be yeah that's
105:38 - cool so um at the end of your free
105:42 - cocaine course the course that you
105:44 - published uh on math or on uh computer
105:47 - science like basically programming 101
105:50 - you say remember to always always feed
105:53 - your curiosity you say that's the final
105:56 - most important rule can you true explain
106:00 - what you mean by feed your curiosity and
106:02 - why it's so
106:04 - important yeah that used to be my Mantra
106:07 - I used to always say it at theend of the
106:10 - videos I have it at the end of my
106:12 - description still but yeah so the the
106:13 - whole concept behind that is I I think
106:15 - it was really important it was a lesson
106:17 - that I learned pretty young
106:20 - that there there's so many like things
106:23 - that we can do in a in a
106:26 - lifetime
106:28 - but if you don't if you don't follow the
106:32 - things that make you curious if you
106:33 - don't feed that Curiosity you you will
106:36 - you'll never end up where you need or
106:38 - you deserve to
106:40 - be and it was just something that I like
106:44 - to say just to remind people that like
106:46 - yeah you might get curious about code
106:47 - you might get curious about whatever it
106:49 - is Graphics or sports or whatever it is
106:53 - take that action feed that Curiosity
106:55 - find out if you actually like it or
106:57 - not because you never know where it
106:59 - might lead you you know I would not be
107:01 - here today if it was for me feeding my
107:04 - insatiable curiosity yeah you might be
107:06 - working at Joanne's Fabric Store hey I
107:09 - could be working at Joann's Fabric Store
107:11 - it's a good call back yeah so what are
107:14 - you focused on now obviously uh you've
107:17 - got uh hackware can you talk about that
107:20 - real quick and also like your hacks like
107:22 - kind of like logo that's on your beanie
107:25 - here yeah very distinctive uh kind of
107:28 - like handdrawn almost like street art
107:31 - style oh
107:33 - yeah yeah yeah yeah so Hax is the it's
107:38 - very boring but it's just like the
107:39 - company that I use for legal stuff um
107:43 - but tax wear is the IP that I've been
107:47 - building out um I have a really really
107:50 - good story that I cannot wait to tell I
107:53 - wish I can do it faster if I could I
107:54 - would um but hack SAR is the IP and then
107:57 - hack is just like the business that I do
107:59 - merch
108:00 - and anytime I show up I don't know I I
108:03 - haven't really thought too much about
108:04 - hack but it's it's the business and the
108:06 - merchant the hackware it's a it's like a
108:08 - large like intellectual property you say
108:10 - IP like almost like a franchise or like
108:12 - a universe of characters and stories
108:16 - like you would think of like the Star
108:17 - Wars universe or something like that
108:19 - this is a big project it's like a
108:20 - multi-year Endeavor it's huge it's it's
108:23 - humongous it's humongous I've been
108:24 - writing it since 2019 wow it's humongous
108:27 - I wish I can get content out faster but
108:29 - is there like things anything you could
108:31 - say to describe it Beyond just like the
108:33 - name and like those posters behind you
108:35 - like what is it about sure sure so it's
108:38 - a it's a
108:40 - Galaxy um in which uh it's based on
108:45 - Shonen um battles so sh being like the
108:49 - like shou and in uh like the the young
108:52 - kid basically or like young years small
108:55 - years I think is literally how it
108:56 - translates and it's a style of manga
108:58 - like if you ever heard of like Shen jump
109:00 - or some of those uh manga that you can
109:02 - get from Japan that often are translated
109:04 - into English uh it's basically like a
109:06 - style of anime that's all about like
109:09 - mostly young men like kind of overcoming
109:12 - Their Fear and like leveling themselves
109:15 - up is the best way I could describe it
109:18 - is that a good description though yeah I
109:20 - think it's a fair enough description I
109:22 - think the description I like to use
109:23 - nowadays is it's uh story progression
109:27 - through fighting that's that's like the
109:29 - best way I like f like challenges like
109:32 - if you watch like uh for example uh
109:35 - Demon Slayer like it's like he goes from
109:38 - fighting like having to like slice the
109:40 - boulder in half to like finding
109:41 - progressively higher level demons um and
109:45 - and that that kind of uh yeah but go
109:48 - ahead yeah so so that that that's what
109:51 - has inspired me I love Shonen so much
109:54 - and that is the that that's at the
109:56 - center of of what the IP is but there
109:59 - are so many really good stories that
110:01 - like I've experienced that I've taken
110:02 - from other people um I I plan to bring
110:05 - out some other writers to tell some of
110:07 - their stories as well and just it's a
110:09 - Galaxy in which like all of this uh is
110:12 - contained in and the first story that
110:14 - I'm starting with it's haware
110:16 - Paragon it's that's the manga and it's
110:19 - about a young man Jinzo or two young men
110:21 - Jinzo and Swift
110:23 - who are from a little desolate planet
110:25 - and they have this dream to become a
110:27 - great fighter very cliche I understand
110:30 - but it's about the journey that they
110:32 - take that is the real interesting part
110:35 - um and so they're up against the the
110:38 - place that they live doesn't have a lot
110:39 - of resources so they don't have access
110:40 - to like you know work a job and and
110:43 - whatnot so they resort to Crime to make
110:46 - their money they're up against law
110:48 - enforcement they're up against um uh the
110:51 - generational um Authority that came
110:53 - before them uh they're up against
110:56 - themselves and they have to figure out
110:59 - how do they overcome the situation and
111:02 - that is the Lynch pin for the hack for
111:03 - IP but I I have so many stories that
111:05 - I've written and I honestly can't wait
111:07 - to tell and just I got to figure out the
111:09 - best way to get those story out yeah and
111:12 - so you're thinking it's going to be a
111:13 - manga and then ultimately like an anime
111:16 - or are you going to make it an
111:17 - interactive
111:19 - experience I'm still trying to figure it
111:21 - out I I started with the first thing I
111:23 - made was a um audio book because it was
111:27 - simple and easy to get it up and running
111:28 - but like people don't really care about
111:29 - audio books is what I learned and so I
111:31 - did a manga but now the manga's taking a
111:33 - while so I'm thinking about doing like
111:34 - an app type thing yeah like maybe a
111:37 - visual novel or something that's the
111:38 - medium we chose I mean it's not as
111:41 - exciting I think but maybe like a voiced
111:43 - visual novel could be like a good
111:45 - compromise where you could just get
111:46 - still images instead of having like
111:48 - animation you're doing so many frames it
111:50 - like exponentially balloons and cost
111:52 - right yeah yeah well we haven't done any
111:55 - animation yet we still have the manga
111:58 - but yeah yeah so there's a lot of lot of
112:00 - really good stories that I'm really
112:01 - excited to tell um we also have a video
112:03 - game that is being released in this IP
112:05 - as well hackware enforcer games haware
112:07 - enforcer very cool yeah and uh so would
112:10 - you say that's like your like long run
112:13 - like your long-term Vision like how like
112:15 - the next 5 10 years is that a huge part
112:17 - of your professional life uh I hope so I
112:20 - hope so I think if I'm looking long term
112:22 - I just really want to tell this story
112:24 - and just have the story out here I I one
112:27 - of my favorite stories I'm sorry one of
112:29 - my favorite IPS of all time is
112:32 - X-Men and it didn't become my favorite
112:35 - IP until I learned about its
112:37 - inspiration it was Stanley's commentary
112:39 - on civil rights and when I learned
112:43 - that it overnight the value of X-Men
112:47 - changed for me and that is just the
112:49 - power of Storytelling I believe and so
112:51 - like that that that's what I want to do
112:52 - is want to tell a really good story that
112:54 - is fun entertaining but also like really
112:56 - says something you
112:58 - know yeah absolutely man I'm a huge
113:01 - X-Men fan uh I'm actually watching the
113:03 - animated series with my kids uh the the
113:06 - old one didn't they reboot it Xmen is
113:09 - not a reboot it's a continuation they
113:10 - just pick up where they left off really
113:13 - yeah it's called X-Men 97 and it
113:15 - literally takes like the last episode
113:16 - and just goes right into yeah like it
113:19 - never ended oh I never knew that so I
113:22 - don't I just learned about this from
113:24 - Leon Noel 100 dev's founder a few days
113:27 - ago like literally last last week is
113:29 - when I learned about it so uh yeah that
113:32 - that interview is probably live by the
113:34 - time anybody's listening to this but we
113:36 - do talk a lot about X-Men he's a big
113:37 - X-Men fan too he said he literally cried
113:40 - when he saw the trailer for the new one
113:42 - yeah he was that excited about it it's a
113:44 - real fan yeah awesome man well it's been
113:46 - such an a privilege taking nearly two
113:49 - hours of your time hanging out with you
113:51 - Jael
113:53 - I'm going to add links to a lot of your
113:55 - different projects um in the show notes
113:57 - everyone be sure to check these out be
113:59 - sure to follow Jail's YouTube channel
114:01 - check out some of his back catalog of
114:03 - hilarious videos check out his new AI
114:07 - tool toy your your friend your AI friend
114:10 - that you like physically bring around
114:12 - with you that was amazing gibot yeah
114:15 - yeah check that out and um I just really
114:17 - appreciate you making time to join us
114:19 - man thank you for having me I I truly
114:22 - appreciate it and thanks for everything
114:23 - you guys are doing for the community
114:24 - honestly yeah well everybody until next
114:27 - week happy coding

Cleaned transcript:

e welcome back to the free Coke Camp podcast I'm Quincy Larson teacher and founder of free Coke camp.org each week we're bringing you Insight from developers Founders and ambitious people getting into Tech this week we're joined by jabril jabril is building a turnbased fighting game called Ultra bouts and he's developed a ton of games over the years which he's featured on his very popular YouTube channel all about game development got lots of links to cool stuff that he's built over the years that you can check out but first jabil how's it going man Quincy thanks for having me man thanks for the intro that was such a great intro thanks yeah I just I rehearsed when I told you earlier I just rehearse when I'm like walking back from dropping my kids off at school like just kind of yeah any anyway yeah I'm thrilled to have you here man cuz like I've just enjoyed so much like uh watching your video lat I always watch it late at night because it's so entertaining and you I find you like laugh twice as hard at things when it's like a little bit after bedtime so uh yeah man like I was just watching like for example the fake Shark Tank Episode generator tool that you created that that creates the the scripts from like uh Shark Tank and like they're very absurd product ideas but like you know it feels just like an actual Shark Tank Episode in terms of the absurdity of the show which is if anybody spent a lot of time in business you know that the show is pretty divorced from reality in terms of how business deals actually go down but that's that's part of the fun of it right it's reality television which is really hyperreal television yeah yeah so anyway I'm sorry to like ramble right off the bat man but it's great to have you here yeah it's great to be here man I'm excited to talk about all things code and development and Game Dev and let's get into it awesome and I just want to point out also jabril uh contributor to the freeo camp Community you can check out his 5our introduction to programming course it's very flavorful and it's very different from like kind of like the more straight lace course that I would develop if I were creating of course it's you just have all these different kind of like visual gags and other things you do to like really engage and help people retain everything so like yeah I'm going to link to that as well in the show notes be sure to check that out after you finish listening to this interview yeah after after yeah and just a real quick I want to thank the 8,452 people around the world who support free Coke Camp each month thank you for supporting us with your donations it's a huge help to our charity and it makes programming like this possible so if if you are not yet supporting free C Camp check out uh freec camp.org donate and you can start supporting us today tax exempt charity you can deduct this from your taxes and you know our mission is very simple to create free learning resources for everyone one of those resources of course interviews with real life game devs who are in the field building projects getting players play testing refining and continuing to extend their library of awesome interactive experiences for people interactive art really um so yeah jail I just want to go way back I always like to start with childhood like tell us about little jbr tell us about like your early formative years and how you got into Game Dev yeah let's go back uh before I do that I want to give a shout outs to you guys over at free code Camp love what you guys are doing keep it up um so let's let's go back I think it's it's probably best that I start with um I was I think 9 years old I was living in Virginia at the time my father's in the military so I've been around the coast of the United States and I played a lot of video games when I was growing up actually I should take it back back back when I was I think four I think it was my mom used to play a lot of video games on the Super Nintendo and she used to play uh Donkey Kong Country and I would watch her play this game and I was just so amazed because she had a control in her hand right and she's controlling Donkey Kong but there's other agents on screen and as a young kid I'm like who who's controlling the agents who's controlling the other ones right and so I've always had a FAS but it wasn't until I was about 9 years old when I was introduced to the first Smash Bros on Nintendo 64 and I don't know what it is about that project that game it just like got my game development bug like just running and I will never forget we moved from Virginia to California and I had a notepad and the entire time I'm just like designing levels that I would do if I was the developer for Smash Bros um and then fast forward to I think it was like I was 14 and I got an advertisement for this thing called Game Maker it's like you can code you can code you can make games without coding what the ad and I was like no way Mom can you buy this for me and she was like well if you do your chores for a week straight I'll buy it for you you dang right I did my chores for we week straight she bought it for me and that was the last time I got a full night's sleep wow yeah so you pretty early on you were like I love games I I'll tell you a little anecdote about Smash Brothers when it came out like of course I was like a big N64 like like I had N64 actually had four controllers cuz I loved couch coop games as as they're called now you call it couch Coop because you're actually playing in the room with other people unlike most you know online games today uh and I remember like that was such a game changer it was so imaginative I just I couldn't believe the absurdity like wow I can actually go up as Donkey Kong and punch Mario in the face like and knock him off the level and even like the the actual intro stuff kind of like like the final boss is like hands and it it really evokes kind of like a childlike play like you're actually like you pick up your action figures as a kid and you'd have HeMan and Skeletor fist fight and stuff like twisting him around and stuff and and that kind of it had that that Vibe of like I'm just a kid who's hanging out on a summer day and playing with my action figures yeah such a cool game yeah it's an amazing game huge competitive uh scene around that game too which I never would have imagined like people getting so good at it they dedicate like years to getting really good at playing Princess Peach in Smash Brothers Melee like a specific character in a specific game but it's a Legendary game you know it's Legendary game yeah so okay so you get game maker your your mom gets it for you after being a really good kid for a week I don't know about all that but uh I did my choice what what what were the first few days like uh when you had game maker like what were the first things you experimented with okay man so it was Game Maker 5 and they had a bunch of examples I'll never forget it it was like a I forget what the actual game is but it was like a plane game 2D plane game and it was like an example project and then they showed you how to like shoot bullets how to control the plane move left and right how to spawn enemies and I just spent so many hours trying to understand like what every little component was doing and all the examples that they had I think they had just converted over to mark in game maker as a something you can make games without coding so like a drag and drop system like really early days and I did the best I could to understood like the logic that was going on and then I made my first project was was like a a pong remix if you will uh I can send you an image of that I still have images of it yeah and it it was terrible it was an absolutely terrible game uh I did not understand physics but I did the best I could uh but I shipped it so that's that's pretty important and then I just kept on I and then I learned about the forums I learned about the game maker forums which was like so important to my learning on how to use Game Maker because all of a sudden I had this resource to all these people that haven't doing it for years and I ask them questions they will answer it and yeah yeah so getting hooked up with other game developers like did you find that that like was a huge motivational shot in the arm in terms of like I'm actually showing off to people that I'm interacting with did you feel like you found your SoCal you know your tribe so to speak yeah yeah 100% And I think one thing that's easy to miss from back in the days is that distribution of games was not it was not a thing like you were making games for yourself and maybe 10 other people in a forum thread that's about it so back then like you had to do it for the love of it and I think that having discovered the Forum it really helped keep that love alive you know yeah I mean did you build any games that you just like kept to yourself like this is my game like I just want to like I'm the only person who's ever played this this game kind of like a lot of musicians they like hoard like their best work just for themselves to enjoy there were a few projects where that was the case but I I wouldn't say I put like all my time energy into it um the ones where I put a lot of time energy I wanted as many people to play as possible but again back in those days like you're talking 20 down it's like oh my God yes I can't believe this yeah but there there was one project in particular I'll never forget that I made with my brother and sister and it was you you had to like race to the helicopter it was like a threeplayer game we had to split the keyboard into three different controls through like it was was arrows and something else and we just shared a keyboard but it was so fun to you know be able to put our imagination you know into an app it was a good time do you play with you said Lo WD just for anybody who hasn't gamed recently like that's those are the keys that I guess customarily uh people playing like Counter Strike and stuff will use but I actually use esdf because it gives my pinky like access to more buttons for like switching weapons and stuff so and I I know uh I learned about this from Gabe Newell founder of steam uh or of uh valve uh now the steam company instead of making games they just have a game platform they do occasionally put out games but uh but yeah he he's like a esdf player instead of a wd player how do you what do you have any particular since we're on the topic like do you have any particular like control scheme quirks that you think are unique to you uh I don't think so honestly these days I if it's not a Gamepad I don't know if I can play it okay yeah so so even like for PC games and stuff you like plug a PlayStation controller in or something like that I'm a I'm a huge Gamepad buff I have so many game pads like weird ones and all types of unique ones so yeah I have a bunch of ones that will fit the best need for whatever the game is if they support it of course awesome yeah do you ever get like like the steering wheel type game like or like the flight stick do you do any games like that I wish that I had time to invest in stuff like that I my dad had one when I was younger and it was pretty fun but now days I I don't have like an hour block to just dedicate to that unfortunately so it's not worth the investment well you're you're focused on getting getting things done and making games not just playing games right so um so before we get into like fullblown game development I do want to learn a little bit more like so you went from the forums was there like a particular like Apo in game development where you're just focusing on that very small audience of people on the same thread on a forum like hey I've been working on this game here's the latest build you know stuff like that was there was there a transition period where you started making games for like a broader audience and do you remember what that Reflection Point was um H that's a great question honestly I don't think that really happened until I started the YouTube channel yeah now there was like a a rudimentary form of that so on the forums I I don't know how many active people there were I'd say probably a hundred people were active you know a given month any given month and if when you got good enough in the community you could have a a thread post that you would update like your game is doing and people would chime in they would play it and give you feedback but it required a certain level of skill and I remember I hit that I hit that threshold for like one or two of my projects but by that time I was you know transitioning out of game maker and getting into like you know High School sports and going to college prep and all that stuff you know so so a lot of people's passions are derailed by high school and like the kind of high school metag game so to speak like oh I've got to be were you were you like a popular kid at school or like how would you describe your high school experience I wouldn't say I was popular in the sense that like a lot of people correlate like the popular kid too I got along with everyone so I I guess I was popular in that sense but no I wasn't I definitely wasn't the popular kid and and it's interesting the school that I went to I I was definitely in the closet about making games I didn't tell anyone just due to the school that I went to like no one cared about it and it was kind of nerdy if you will back then so I wasn't trying to get stuffed in the locker you know yeah have you like so this is just like an observation like I I saw this interesting video essay you know I watch lot lot of video essays on YouTube uh and it was about like how like nerdy and geeky and like these terms have kind of like almost fallen out of use because like everybody's a Star Wars fan now or you know uh you know a Lord of the Rings fan or something like there there's not really a stigma associated with using computers like there used to be I mean have you observed that like I mean do you ever feel like what you're doing is quotequote nerdy anymore when you're like you know making these very you know artial games that are very esoteric and like probably a very small subset of Gamers let alone people at large would be interested in playing these games yeah the so nerves are definitely in Vogue now and I think about this quite often it's hard to unpair my experiences as a nerve as a kid right from you know the the man that I am today but uh it's so I think it's so beautiful that there are so many people that I can reach out to and have conversations about code about game development about apps because I remember when I was starting out it was nearly impossible to find anyone to talk about this stuff with like I was lucky that my mom had a friend that knew someone that had a software development job and when I asked him for advice he just gave me Visual Studio 20 for something like that he just gave it to me and it was like good luck like that was all I had and I remember trying I tried to install it and I was like I have no idea what this is and I just never touch it again um but yeah I think it's so beautiful that you know nowadays you can talk to literally anyone about code and they'll have some idea and I think it's just due to the prevalence of how important you you know code is and how prevalent it is in our society nowadays you know yeah 100% like I've definitely found that like when I'm at a dinner party or something uh it used to be like even 10 years ago I'd be like oh yeah I'm a software developer and people would be like oh okay cool and the conversation would just move in move on but now people are like oh cool like um I'm working on this app you know or like I've been doing some python on the weekend and stuff like that and like suddenly like it just seems like the number of people who are interested in learning programming has skyrocketed and that any like uh there there's kind of like there used to be that like oh it's for smart people type talk but I don't really hear that anymore when I talk to people it could be that just like the crowd I'm rolling with is a little older now um because I'm older so like when I go talk to people they're often in their 30s and 40s like I am you know uh as opposed to like younger kids when I was a kid like people were like not very sure of themselves and they would often like limit themselves but you know as you grow older you start to realize oh like these limits are artificial you know like there's nothing stopping an accountant from getting really good at coding right um I did you I think it's more than that though well I I I think it's a bit more than that I think that you know just relating to my experiences when I was a kid the accessibility to these things were so hard to get to right but we have things like free code camp for example right where if I want to learn something I just go to free code camp and you guys have all these resources for me to learn how to do these things right and this is something that we have to thank the modern era for you know uh you you know you take game maker for example I'm so happy that they decided to do a drag and drop system because without that I don't know if I would have I don't know how long it would have took me to discover code you know but that was a good entry point for me to say like hey this looks like something I can do you know you're you're telling me I don't need to code but little did I know it was a stepping stone to the actual code because there's limits to what you can do with the dragon drop but the point I'm trying to make is that I think just things have got a lot more accessible in the Modern Age and it has really enabled so many people to be able to learn to code or just simply know more about what it takes to code or be a coder you know yeah absolutely well uh I'm really interested in like understanding kind of the tools that your tool progression because you said that uh you had like some some friend who gave you visual Studios which is a gigantic very complicated piece of software right like that's like an industri at 15 yeah so you that's like giving somebody the master sword right when they walk into the cave instead of like you know stair stepping them up through like some sort of like leveling progression right uh so what what did you do you're like you put that down did you just go back to game maker like what what tools did you get into do you remember the sequence of tools you progressed through well funny enough the the I got Visual Studio before I even knew game maker existed so I knew that I wanted to make games but I didn't know how it it like I cannot explain how my understanding of making games was like how how difficult it was for me to to grasp the concept of making a game how do you use a computer to render Graphics to render logic Etc I I can't explain to you like how difficult trying to imagine that was um and so yeah the first I asked my mom and she had the friend he gave me Visual Studio I was like here you go this is how you code good luck that was all he gave me I tried to install it I tried to install it didn't work thankfully like a year or two later I discovered game maker uh and they did game maker for like four years I think it was something like that and then I found Unity soon after that and tell us about Unity just like for people that are uninitiated like why is Unity different from you know like n SDK for developing on like PlayStation or something like that right yeah Unity it just provides so many things for you it makes like developing games so easy uh they do graphics for you they do physics for you they do um different like pathf finding logic they do so many things for you right out the box that you don't have to think about the hard stuff you can just get started making some type of game and then in the process of making your game using their their out of thebox tools you learn how to like use those tools more proe over time and that was really instrumental for me I I'll never forget when I first started Unity that using Unity was the first time I ever made a 3D game it was always my goal to make 3D games but having done 2D for so long I thought it was like such an impossible task but in the first I think week of using Unity so much of what I learned with game maker not to mention game maker has their own coding language as well so that was another thing that was like oh I'm not a real coder I'm using gameer language yeah exactly it's like I'm not really coding I'm using scratch or I'm using some simplified for but it really is still coding I think people kind of like talk themselves out of like like you know acknowledging what their their accomplishments they they kind of like denigrate their accomplishments oh I'm just using the training wheels equivalent but it's still coding right yeah yeah 100% And so I'm using Game Maker language and I'm like I'm not a real coder because I'm using their little subset language right but then I start to uh develop games in unity I was like why not right and I was like wait a second this is C this is this is a this is a big boy language I know what a for Loop is I know what an if statement is I I know what a wild Loop is like hold on I know all these Concepts and like it was so easy to transfer from game maker language to C and then from there C to Python and then yeah it as long as you learn the basics I don't no matter what the language is like coding is so easy to transfer the skills over yeah absolutely like at the at the end of the day it's like the same basic like data structure and algorithm Concepts that have been around since Allan Turing right maybe maybe like a few were refined by subsequent generations of computer scientists and then you're just applying math that has been known all the way back to like aisi back and like yeah you the ancient uh you know Indian civilizations and Babylonian civilizations and stuff right like there's nothing new Under the Sun except layers of extraction that make it easier and will continue to make it gradually easier and easier and and we'll definitely talk about that in a little bit but I what were you doing now you can make a 3D game right it's not some pipe dream it's it's something you actually did within the first week of using these tools yeah like what was that like a honeymoon phas for you were you like walking on air knowing like wow I'm actually doing it yeah I was incredibly proud I I believe the first s game I made was a game Jam uh it's still up somewhere it's called super hay stack finder or something that super stack finder finding a needle in a Hast stack or something like that that's yeah that's the concept so you're jumping platform to platform you're looking for a little a cookie for some reason um so that was the first project I did and I was like there's no way like this was so easy you just add one extra Dimension and it's not that difficult and then from there I made my first app that I launched on the Google Play Store it's called Pizza jump still up to this day and I was so proud of that game I was so proud uh and then from there like the sky was the limit I was unlocked I was Unleashed like I I I will I never will forget that after that project that was when I really realized that like there are no limits I can do anything I can do anything and then from there I got into python which I want to say really quick there's one piece of advice that I have for anyone who especially like starting to develop no matter what language it is be very careful listening to some people who try to give you advice on like what language is good or bad or not because there were so many people that telling me that python is not a useful language and it's it's for beginners and it's not a good language but python is so powerful like when I started to code in Python and how simple it was to do certain Concepts comparative to to C I was like what are you guys talking about this thing is amazing and then obviously you got all this support and you can do Ai and artificial intelligence learning it but yeah there just so many lessons that are coming to me at at such a short period of time that I'll never forget so it's almost like uh like a lot of the kind of Mythos around game development is melting away and you're seeing like the actual daytoday of game development the Practical considerations how do I get distribution for my game how do I um come up with interesting ideas that are going to be fun how can I recombine these different game development Concepts and tropes that have been pioneered through like the 70s 80s 90s like how can I recombine those into interesting games right I I don't mean to be putting too many words in your mouth but that's I imagine you're probably going through something like that as a kid who's just built their first game using Unity yeah and and so where did you go from there like so you're in high school you're building games like do you show your friends you said that you didn't uh that you kind of kept your game development to yourself because nobody was interested in that stuff they're probably interested in you know typical high school stuff like football and getting a car and other stuff like you grew up in California right like you said you moved for what uh area of California were you in I live in San Diego and went to a very very Urban school so yeah a lot of the kids there they're used to playing like the Call of Duties and Need for Speed and all the you know the the triaa games I'll never forget I showed my friend I I had this really uh rudimentary but cool drifting game like like car drifting game yeah drift racing game that I showed my friend and it was like gray box and whatnot but and he just laughed at me he's like what is this like why would I ever play this you know and I mean listen I understand where he's coming from you know why would he waste his time playing that when there's like Need for Speed etc etc but I'll never forget that experience I like yeah I'll just keep this in my little Forum friends that sucks man that's that's so discouraging but like like let's talk about kind of opening up and blossoming of the BR as you kind of like so you're going to have lots of encounters like that just like like I had similar encounters with my writing like I'd write like a short story I'd show it to somebody they'd be like oh man this is why would I read this when I can go read you know you know bestselling book by somebody right that you get it like the supermarket or whatever you know like how did you kind of did you ever stop doing game development at any point I did I did I had a I think it was like a fouryear gap of I didn't really touch code at all wow um yeah it was so The Story Goes at 15 I introduced to game maker five and then I'm making games really passionate about it but then I think I I turned like a junior in high school and all of a sudden like you know I'm interested in girls and being cool and going to parties and stuff right and so that's where I start to invest a lot of my time and I just like stopped touching code um but I pick it back up at I think like 23 or something like that so from 19 to like 23 four years something like that 23 24 um is when I pick it back up again cuz you know if you have a passion for something like no matter what it's always going to poke you so hey was it like calling to you from the bookshelf like you just walk by your old uh Unity books back in the day we'd like buy actual gay like books like these big thick books some of them would come with CD ROMs and stuff I don't know if that may have been before your time CU you're a little bit younger than me but like did you ever like look at your old things like oh like kind of like heave like your chest little huh like like Toy Story when he kind of like gets tired of the toys and uh maybe Toy Story 10 Toy Story 11 he actually becomes like Tom Hanks character from big where he's like working at an exe you know as like a toy tester at some big toy company or something like that you know like like pining back for the for the toys did you ever feel that kind of like that you were trying to deny a part of yourself that Society was like causing you to like deler V deler from that childhood ambition yeah I think in hindsight I definitely agree with that obviously in the moment I I didn't have any awareness of this but yeah I think it hit a point where I realized that all these things that I was chasing externally didn't really matter you know like when the friends dried up and the party stopped you know calling me to come over all you're left with is these memories that you have as a kid you know spending 16 hours a day developing this game that 10 people are going to look at you know yeah and yeah it was calling me back I was like hey look I you know really enjoyed those times s and I want to have memories like that again so I picked up game maker again started making some games again and then it hit a point where I wanted to 3D and so Unity was that option yeah so like once you hit the ground running with unity like like maybe you can just take us give us a quick tour of the next few years of your life like what what were you doing did you have the equivalent of like you know Kanye staying at home an entire summer making beats you know like where it was like a Renaissance of creativity or like what happened yeah yeah yeah yeah I I yes 100% that that was me from 15 to like 18 like every single Summer from that point on I was like nope don't want to go to parties no don't want to do anything I'm just going to sit here in code games um but in terms of so I I I got to Unity I think around like 23 24 and then I'm making games in unity and I'm watching all these different tutorials and whatnot and I'm also making YouTube videos not I'm not making the YouTube videos I'm making today I'm making like documentary style YouTube videos but then I realized that like there's a lot of people that have tutorials on how to like make these games and whatnot right but there weren't a lot of channels of people making stuff from what they learn from the tutorials yeah and I was like I'm going to do that that sounds like fun you know you kind of found a new Lane uh and and like I have lots of friends who do this genre of YouTube video where they're like I built this game like like or they speed up the development and it's like just lightning fast like here now we got the character jumping and not like slumping over and stuff like that right so like I to some extent I think you inspired or helped inspire a lot of people who now do that kind of uh game development and like actually apply the skills that they learned from tutorials on like free code camp and places like that right can you talk about like an early video that you created and at what point did you start uploading videos to YouTube it was like maybe like eight or eight or nine years ago yeah that's a whole other that's a whole other Branch but yeah yeah been a long time before we get to that you've been building games like I'm just trying to bridge the past with the present like yeah what point did you start like like did you why did you even approach YouTube did you were you like this can help me raise awareness of my games or I just I have time I'm just going to create some videos for myself and my friends what was your philosophy I I've done a lot of things all right I've done a lot of things I'm going to make it really brief because that's a whole other branch of the story but to make it short and correlated to the coding stuff when I was in high school me and some buddies got together and decided to make a a YouTube channel okay we didn't have any skills we didn't really know anything so we made a prank Channel okay it was just a thing to do back then and that taught me a lot about uh how to build audiences how lucrative it can be to create internet content and so that bug that that bug was like the the foundation for me to later create the Channel that I have today but so long story short it hit a point where the pranks where YouTube demonetized all pranks across the platform I was okay this this Jig Is up right yeah however I knew that there was still a lot of value in speaking to an audience and you know giving them entertainment and value and so I made a documentary Channel where I would just document various things that was happening all the while in the background I come home and I'm coding like hours and hours and hours at night but it didn't dawn on me to share what I was doing it was this is past game maker Forum so I didn't really have anyone to share it with it was just kind of like a me thing I did for myself you know as a as a meditation if you will but yeah one day it hit me that I spend I was spending so many hours developing games and apps so many hours watching tutorials and what I wanted was more content on YouTube of people demonstrating their learnings from these this content and at the time there was maybe one person that was doing it and so I decided to completely Rebrand my channel to jabrils we're doing coding now and I think like the fourth video blew up I did a AI machine learning project in unity and uh good times good times yeah so um first of all why is there an S at the end of your name jabrils is like Jail's Channel or is that why I I love this question um you're going to be a little disappointed the answer is just because I find it funny I can't tell you how many times like i' I've been in rooms with execs and they call me jbr's plural and it's just so it's just funny I don't know if I call it's test of whether people actually know who you are like no we like um so I have a friend uh and what she does is like she puts like an emoji like a Ramen Emoji or something at the front of her LinkedIn name that way when like recruiters or some automated message sends it it always she can always see the ramen Emoji at the beginning of her name and she knows oh this isn't a real person who knows me this is just like some bulk like mail or something like that so smart unfortunately no I just find it funny when people refer to me as a plural it's just funny it's like if I call you Quincy as you multiple people it's just funny that's it yeah that'd be like the Quincy from Bleach everybody's tell I haven't seen bleach but everybody's like oh yeah the quincies like people occasionally every once in a while you get this email I want let you take my bonai what's bonai you know but apparently there's like this race of like Angels or something like that in in this show Bleach and they're the most powerful cuz they can take away like the Bleach characters like weapon the Bon anyway sorry but but like yeah so you have this YouTube channel the fourth video blows up of course like this happens to a lot of people like free C Camp we published uh you know some videos that really blew up like after like I think like three or four years and we're like oh should we chase this success like maybe we should lean into this like Lane that we found and it's it's hard to reproduce that lightning in the bottle yeah what was your like after that fourth video what happened I did not learn learn my lesson unfortunately it took me a while to learn my lesson what I mean by that is so this video blows up and it reaches a large audience an audience I've never seen before and in hindsight I realized like what I should have done was really capitalize on the audience give them more of what they wanted but instead I continued to make content that you know was just really for me and the views didn't really match that but I I think it was a really important part to to my journey but it did give me a greater audience than what I had previously but yeah so so maybe you could talk about that balance of like balancing your own interest rather than just becoming like YouTuber person who's the generically approachable interesting person that like you know probably does well on YouTube but but I think to some extent the algorithm probably forces you in certain directions in terms of uh being not yourself but being who people want you to be right like I imagine if you're like a late night TV show host you have to shave off a lot of the edges and and you know like probably similar with YouTube I I mean I don't know this because I've steadfastly refused to adopt like various conventions around you know video podcasting like I didn't even do video podcasting for a long time and now that we're doing them I'm doing them in like a kind of a weird way like no editing uh any of that stuff that it's like unconventional but it's I want to do it I want it to be real right like how did you balance like you probably saw the numbers like oh people don't like the real jabril as much as they like the jabril from video number four do I have to like put myself in a you know freeze myself in time and just be that exact person for every video if I want to get traction like did you go through that kind of like soul searching it it took me a while to to understand that dichotomy of content uh I'm I'm saying like probably a couple years ago when I really understood this this dichotomy of content um but at the time you you know I was just happy to have any audience watch this watch stuff that I was doing uh but yeah I I it I think that it's not necessarily like what the algorithm is encouraging I think it's more rooted in just human nature right like you turn on any show and you you have some expectation as to what you're going to see right if you turn on America's Funniest Home Videos and all of a sudden they start showing like an a hockey match you be like yeah what what is this I'm never going to watch this again right and you know it's a lesson I had to learn and it is really unfortunate but on top of that I think it's what has inspired me to do things like create a manga or create a game because that element of pleasing an audience really only affects you when you rely on it to pay your bills right I don't rely on the manga or the game that I'm making Ultra bers to to pay my bills therefore I can be as free as I want in my expression with those projects and you know the the the goal with the YouTube channel is to hopefully get to someday where I figure out a way to have that free expression while also paying my bills but it's easier said than done and I'm I'm currently in that Journey so yeah so if you don't mind me asking like like how how do you pay the bills like uh and and maybe you can talk about how you paid the bills like graduating from high school and just you if you graduated and and progressing in general I say if you graduated cuz I I didn't graduate I dropped out as a sopore but like a lot of people uh like they they kind of have this listless period uh did you go to university I went to Junior College for a couple years and then dropped out okay so lot going for the wrong degre yeah what were you wrong degree I was studying film and communication no one told me all right no one told me um but we're s we're literally sitting in class watching movies and like writing essays on movies and I'm just like what what am I doing and so I I was I dropped out with the plan to return to do biology cuz I love biology so much but I learned that my financial aid right now and I was not down to to a loan so yeah well so you dodged the loan bullet uh that's good like you did you figured it out before you had taken on a whole lot of you know potentially restrictive debt that you'd have to pay off um which the credit card they the credit card companies hate me for they tell me I need different types of loans yeah exactly uh well congratulations on that so you you dropped out of Junior College what happens what do you do this is like at some point you did create the YouTube channel but like or maybe you've been doing the YouTube channel for a while but like how did you get from that jabril that didn't really know what what to do to a person who you know has a pretty large like half a million subscriber YouTube channel who's like a household name among game developers who uh built a lot of games and has a lot of games in the App Store and just comes up with really cool projects that we're going to talk a little bit about later like seemingly like every few months you you pop up you're like hey here's this crazy new thing that nobody's ever done before like how did you what what was the transition period yeah between those two people yeah so I I've always had multiple things going on like since as early as I can remember and at the time that I'm doing College I'm also filming for the prank Channel that I was talking about not too long ago and so me and my buddies will get together on the weekend we film the prank stuff and that it didn't pay any bills like it was you know it paid gas for us to get around town every once in a while we get like a sponsor deal and we would split it but I did that at that time I was I was living off financial aid but after that ended I got I started doing a bunch of odd jobs so I worked at a comedy club uh what were you doing then I was I didn't have an official title so it was a new comedy club that opened up in San Diego called American Comedy Co and I just remember code uh emailing the owner because there's a bunch of articles on it and I was like hey I will do anything please just let me help you out I was like yeah sure come by and then I came by and I never had official title but I helped out with marketing I helped out with um you know a little design and whatnot uh that was a lot of fun but that ended for me and then I got into doing uh working at a radio station uh all the while all the while I'm still making YouTube videos trying to figure that part out and then I worked at the radio station for about four years to pay the bills and then oh man I don't know how deep you want to go into this I've done a lot let's do it Comedy Club to a radio station you've had an interesting life so far yeah okay and so so the radio station was the last job that I ever worked and when I left the radio station life got incredibly interesting and difficult at the same time man okay I'm G break it down so at the at the end of me working at the radio station I had a friend that I knew that made prank videos that I met through making prank videos right his name is Garrett his Channel's called over when you say prank video just give us an idea of what a prank video would this be like like MTV punked or something like that or like what what is it what is a prank video so I'm trying to think my favorite prank video that we did so like one video that I did is um I did like a magic trick so I had like a shirt that had a graphic on it but it was like a it was like a magic trick shirt right so like I go and ask people for directions say hey do you know where this thing is and they point me to directions but then like I turn around and do a magic trick the the graphic would change and I turn around it's a new uh graphic and then like wait did your shirt change I'm like what were you talking so it's stuff like that you okay so basically kind of like uh yeah yeah it's just like gaslighting people essentially just that's one way to put it Quincy yeah Okay cool so so I'm sorry like I just wanted to get an idea that sounds like a pretty cool I didn't know there were like design changing shirt I won't ask the mechanics of that cuz I don't want to ruin it if you know how what happens with the quarter when it's supposedly behind your ear it makes it a lot less interesting right but um maybe you can talk about that go back to that friend who was doing these videos with you yeah so so he had his own channel and he had a lot of success from uh doing YouTube pranks way more than I had right and we had reconnected when I was working at the radio station and you said hey I need help filming are you willing to like you lived in Orange County I lived in San Diego it's about 100 miles something like that apart yeah both very nice places to live by the way very very nice places indeed and so I agreed I I would go up to his house I think on the weekends and then stay for a few days help him film then I go back home uh but it hit a point where I was filming with him so much I had forgot that I had a shift at the radio station and they called me and they're like hey you have a shift I'm like I am not in town I cannot make it and so like they call me in they like give me the talk and whatnot they didn't fire me thankfully but I go back to my buddy and I'm telling him about this this this dilemma how fun it is to film with him and how annoying it is to go work at this radio station he's like you should just quit you should quit come work with me I'll pay you some money and it'll all be good and like I'm terrified you know content creation is very risky and So eventually I say okay I'll do it I quit I go work with him a month later we're no longer working together what happened I had there's a lot of drama there's a lot of drama he was going through some stuff in his life um but it's all public if you don't look it up okay my homie overboard humor shouts to Garrett shouts to Garrett um but long story so so after a month of working with him I'm no longer working with him I had maybe $2,000 in savings and I'm like what did I just do and so the content creation is not really doing anything for me uh I take up a lot of odd jobs which is really difficult to do in San Diego at least with the skill set that I had of like film making and whatnot and I I'll never forget I gave up I was like I'm done I'm done throwing in the towel I'm just going to go work some job and figure out how to live a regular casual life and so I take an interview at a store called Joan's fabric stores so like literally like generic retail essentially just just just give me some money I'm going to be like one of the characters from clerks basically just give me some money yeah that that was my only priority and I'll never forget I walked in there and the manager takes me to his room really small cramped room with boxes everywhere and he's like okay so tell me a bit about yourself I tell him he's like interesting what what are your what are your dreams what do you want to do and I was taken back by that question and I told him I was like you know I really wish that I could you know build a YouTube channel and travel the world etc etc and he closes this little book and he says I'll never forget this you don't belong here I'm not going to hire you and I was like what he like yeah all I'm going to do is use you to stock shelves uh stock books uh boxes on shelves I just need someone tall that's it I'll be wasting your talent I I kid you not I kid you not and so I walk out of there just like what just happened but that gave me the energy that I needed to really push as hard as possible on content creation wow shout out to Joan's fabric store like the the manager there for setting you on that course that's great yeah I I wish I would have went and got his name and shook his hand but uh I'll never foret that if he can see you now yeah so that that gave me all the energy I needed I was so fired up after that and I did a bunch of content creation I I spent maybe eight hours a day doing odd job or or looking for odd jobs to enough where it would pay my bills and then one day I came across this odd job from someone who's looking for help to film physics content which happened to be Diana Cowern from physics girl and so huge YouTube channel huge science learning Science Education Channel yeah and I responded to that did some editing for her she liked it and I've been with her editor for like three four years and very incredibly grateful shout outs to Diana I uh can't wait for her to get better yeah absolutely yeah yeah so um so you're doing editing and and is that like how did you transition into like building some of these games were you doing games at the same time maybe just give us a little bit more context into the timeline so that's cool so you've made the transition from Radio which is probably a job a lot of people who study Communications and journalism uh and things like that would be interested in going into but um you know you stopped working in radio and but now you're working in editing for YouTube creators and you're still creating your own stuff on the side but you're paying the bills by working with you know a much more successful like name brand YouTube Creator right correct yes yeah so so yeah I would pay the bills doing a bunch of jobs but all the entire time I'm creating content like it's not getting views it's not making any money but I'm creating content the entire time because it was it was a fun thing to do that I really enjoyed and I always believed in his potential just to get the timeline synced yeah okay awesome and did you have other videos that started to get traction like that like your fourth video did you did you kind of like strike gold so to speak or or like uh kind of find that filament that like lights the bulb correctly to use like a weird uh Thomas Edison analogy like were you able to like iterate toward a formula that worked that would that also resonated with your passion as a Creator a little bit a little bit again in hindsight I think that I I probably should have been learning more lessons rapid more rapidly than I did at the time but I had did the first video of uh Mak a machine learning game it was like writing my first machine learning game something like that it went crazy viral and then I just continue to upload videos like as I seen it and then I struck gold again I made another video called making a game in 48 hours like this is before this was a trend and that video also went really viral but at the time like I was honestly just getting lucky you know I I was learning like little lessons here and there but it wasn't until I connected with a bunch of other content creators and they were able a like share lessons between each other where I really started to adapt you know optimal strategies if you will yeah yeah and like just looking at your most popular videos many of which I've watched uh you know the infinite staircase is real nearly 8 million years my first learning machine learning like about 2 million for that and also the 48 hour game Jam thing uh Minecraft but on a quantum computer you know stuff like that very cool so uh a lot of your videos have connected with the audience and like I guess Way Beyond your audience have had like mainstream appeal over the years can you talk about like what that's like in terms of uh does when you have a video that goes viral like your infinite staircase video did uh I mean 8 million views for like a sciency topic this is not like some you know you're you're not like a hot woman or something like that right like you're you're just a guy who's developing interesting stuff he's like building stuff and showcasing what he's building um can you talk about like the the audience and the experience of having that video blow up I think I've had like a a tweet go viral with the BTS Army and that's like my 15 minutes of fame is like I I I tweeted something about like BTS just not even realizing what I was tweeting and like all these people jumped on me and that I guess that got like 15 million retweets or something like that that's like the closest I've ever gotten to famous so to speak but did you feel famous did things did it feel different to have a video getting all these views and people commenting and talking about it and sharing it uh I think unfortunately the sad part about consecration is you normalize it after a while and the any everything on the jbros channel comes after like some pre Fame that experienced so I did a prank with some buddies a long time ago where we we would I don't know if this is bad or not but it was what it was okay we went up to people and we asked them if they wanted a little pot okay right like pot marijuana we asked them if they wanted a little pot right a little pot they like they like no get away from me freak what the hell and then we would pull out a literal little pot like a literal little pot a cooking pot and that video went crazy viral back in the days and I had so many people reach out to me I was on TV uh someone offered to buy me a meal like it was it was crazy that was the first time it actually felt crazy um but everything after that I think I kind of normalized the experience a bit so you're just kind of like you're the equivalent of that kid like at the computer in the meme like yeah thumbs up it worked you know but then you kind of move on with the the content grind right yeah um and and you view is a a grinder like how how do you approach creating these videos about you know programming computer science and and demonstrating different projects You're Building yeah I don't ever do it for any of the fame or any things like that like I I do it genuinely because I love the ideas and I I love being able to explore new Concepts that probably someone hasn't really explored at least in the manner that that I want to explore it and so my Approach is always is how can I present something to you that you probably don't think about that often or probably haven't seen before in an entertaining manner uh that often when those two meet is often when my videos do the best yeah yeah well let's talk a little bit about Game Dev in general because Game Dev has changed a lot since you got into it obviously like game maker like there was a game called like Hotline Miami that did they use Game Maker for that they use like some really rudimentary like early tool to develop I believe they did yeah and I believe they that was a cool game because it felt like you wouldn't know that they'd use such simple tools to create such an elaborate game with like its own kind of physics engine and everything like that but like there was that whole Flash game era that you develop flash games CU newgrounds.com was huge when I was a kid or when I was a teenager like people would like develop these games you could play right in your browser and it just took accessibility to a new level cuz you just click on it it loads and you play it you don't have to download stuff you don't have to like buy a physical media that you put into a console or anything like that yeah I definitely played more flash games than I made uh I might be mistaken on the timeline but I think by the time I was able to you know grasp logic and coding it was kind of past its prime I may have the timeline incorrect here but I definitely remember when I was younger playing flash games this was like before for Smash Bros and all that mhm um and but I do remember trying I made like one Flash game and I just remember being really annoying the UI interface in in Adobe what was that adobe adob I don't know yeah Adobe Flash yeah Adobe Flash yeah they renamed it so my brain was was yeah Adobe Flash the the UI was really annoying in my personal opinion and I had already had game maker experience so I just preferred game maker but yeah well um um maybe you can talk about like the game development meta so to speak like like who is working on games like are are is it mostly hobbyist are there like hardcore game devs out there that like like like how would you describe the typical game developer in terms of like how they're approaching getting games done I saw the the documentary Indie G Indie Dev uh indie game yeah that was pretty good but I've heard like mixed things from actual game developers about like how representative it is of the typical Game Dev experience and things like that and obviously all three of those games were pretty popular successful in G so it's already kind of like uh showing like a little bit of selection bias survivorship bias I guess uh I I imagine like most projects most don't go anywhere right they probably don't even get completed it's rare that people even finish projects that they start right but like maybe you could talk about like what your how would you describe like a typical game developers lifestyle and and where they hang out like whether that's Discord whether that's um like local kind of game developer hacker space type places maybe you could just give me an idea of you know the the devs that you've come across and you've worked alongside and maybe give us a little more context in your process um do you mind refining the question a bit more yeah absolutely that was like 15 questions in one what do game devs do Daya what's the typical day in the life of a Game Dev yeah so I think like most things there's a lot of variation right and as game development has got more and more accessible I think the variation has only increased so like I know people that are they like game development is their fulltime job right they've released some games to some audiences that love to play their games they charge them for it and they can pay the bills that way right I know game developers that you know they're habitually making a game count in it making a game canceling it making a game cancel it right I know game developers that are always looking for funding right they are going up to investors saying like hey I have this idea will you please give me money to make it right and I know game developers that just do the YouTube thing right there's a lot of variation um but I will say thank you I will say that I think the the commonality between them all is that a lot of them have like a a lot of passion for making games and and telling stories and uh you know trying to present something cool and creative to an audience yeah what what are some I think the most important thing if you are trying to be a game developer that can actually ship games is scope you have to learn scope uh I think that's top of the funnel next up is Passion focus on games that you you yourself want to play and then after that I would say is audience try toate games for existing audiences um I think if you pair all those three things together you will have a lot of games under your belt which which and and I want to emphasize how important it is to actually ship games I think it's fun to like habitually explore new Concepts and whatnot but shipping games is what you get critiqued on you don't get get critiqued on you know how well you can Implement a pathf finding algorithm you know what I mean yeah that makes total sense so just uh to recap scope passion for what you're building and having an existing audience not having to like Forge out in the wild for people that are interested in your completely novel game um but can you describe scope like and maybe how you Scope things and and where scope creeps maybe just start by defining scope yeah uh so so scope is the hardest one because it does require some like prior knowledge on what whatever you're building right like so if I'm building a game that requires pathf finding I have to have some knowledge on like the domain of pathf finding to be able to scope it um and pathfinding is like like having an AI kind of like go around in certain paths is it that literally it like just programming NPCs and stuff yeah nonplayer yeah yeah yeah um so so yeah scope is the hardest because again you need you need to some you need to have some understanding of the domain of whatever you're implementing but it's not impossible to get that information right there's so many resources everywhere you know especially in 2024 but yeah so can you give me an example of a time that you like maybe made scope too broad and scope is like like just basically focusing on a few key game elements or focusing on like what the goals of the project are you know it's easy to think like oh I'm going to create an open world game and it's going to of XYZ and like you know you look at like Cy Punk uh 2077 I can't remember the exact year but like that is a game that had so much scope creep that it ruined the game if they just not made it open world or if they' not tried to add all these different attributes and stuff like they they they got too big for their britches right they they leaned out farther than they they should have in in terms of you know the scope and right yeah and scope can prevent a project from ever getting done because the the scope can keep expanding as an excuse to not actually ship like as a procrastination you know excuse right yeah yeah 100% yeah so so has there been an instance that you can recall where you're like you you're like you know I think I've I've gone outside of my original scope or I I've I've made some sort of error when it comes to scope and I need to correct it it's a problem that I used to have a lot but developing for a YouTube channel it teaches you Scope really quickly because you have a regular schedule of releases like I've only got two months to build this game or like what's your release schedule do you have a fixed schedule yeah every I have to upload one video within 30 days of the last video that's what I operate off of okay it can be seven days it can be 12 days but I can't go more than 30 days okay that's a great rule to live by so that guides like for example I have to publish a podcast every Friday I have to send out an email newsletter every Friday right like so like those things force me to be to myself and the rules I put in place so I love how you have that very simple rule you know I can create videos as frequently as I want but it doesn't matter how many I've published I still need to have one within 30 days of the last one yeah yeah that's really cool it's like like uh yeah so so come full circle so like that that process it really has taught me a lot about scope right because it's it's one thing to be like I want to make this game where I have all my my subscribers connect to a server and they can walk around the world and drive cars like that's one thing right but then just having done this for so long I can have a good idea on like okay how long is it going to take me how many hours I investing if I start this video project in January am I going to finish it in in March or is it going to take me February of next year you know and it's something it's a skill that you have to hone I'm not going to sit here and say that it's easy but it's definitely something that I encourage everyone to pay attention to and try and home you know yeah so one of the things I want to ask is for people that are listening and they're interested in going into game development maybe they have some basic programming chops maybe they've completed cs50 they've gone they've earned a few free codam certifications they have a basic understanding of you know maybe python JavaScript uh maybe they haven't worked with unity yet but you know it sounds like that's a tool you would encourage people to pick up um so let's say hypothetically um they want to be a Game Dev two years from now they want to have a game life or do they even need two years like like what would you do if you starting over with everything you know today but you didn't have the skills you have today you didn't have the network that you have today in terms of like distribution being able to just publish a video on YouTube and have thousands of people see it like what would you do I love this question yes 100% listen nowadays is one of the most like accessible times we've ever lived in for anything and everything if I had to start over given the prompt you just gave I would first of all make a mobile game I would do active development so make an MVP that's minimal viable product yeah mhm launch the MVP start collecting feedback immediately whoever you can get the hands on your mom your brother your coworker whoever it is we have platforms like Tik Tok that you can easily reach an audience if you just learn how the like the different ways to game the system Instagram reals YouTube shorts like these are all platforms that have millions and millions of people watching a ton of content in a short period of time so that's what I would do and and and in fact that's what I'm doing for Ultra bouts all those things I just described I think that is the modernday developer and there's a lot of money to be made you know if you do this as well you know it's add model and if your game is good enough it connects with the audience good enough you can do inapp purchases yeah awesome so that would be your your advice if I can re summarize it is just build an MVP as quickly as possible get it out there start iterating and publicize it through short videos the short video format that is taking over YouTube For Better or Worse um and like of course you know like uh you know potentially programming our kids to be like extremely uh you know um sensitive to their physical appearance right um things like that right so sure sure we don't talk about that can yeah can I add one more caveat yeah last thing I want to add to that is really important is no one to quit no when to quit okay tell me about no one to quit no when to quit I'm taking notes so if you do all these things and you see that like no one's really responding no one really cares about your MVP or update 3 whatever it is you have to realize that maybe you just did not create a product that has a good Market fit and move on to the next one it's sad sometimes it sucks but it all depends on what you're looking for if you're looking to actually be a game developer that you can get Awards and all these accolades and pay your bills knowing when to quit is very important and it it's hard when we talk about like art but the truth of the matter is nowadays we have a completely different system you can't it's much harder for you to be the artist wait hold on let me let me rephrase that yeah nowadays it's more expected that you not only just the artist or the sound designer or the programmer you're all you weren't all hats now right once upon a time you can go work for a company and just play that role and have someone else figure out when to quit right but now you wear all the hats and you have to you know put on your business hat and you know pay attention to things so the brutal suit that's within you the uh the the pointy haired boss right the uh the the person who has to you know make the cold calculated business decision that person is the same as the creative genius who's like scrolling all over the Whiteboard with all these game ideas you have to be both if you want to succeed if if you want to succeed if you want to do it as a hobby you can do whatever you want but yeah I find that to be like the biggest thing that a lot of my game of offer friends fail to realize is that as much as this is an art medium and like we want to use it for artistic means what is art if no one ever engages with it you know yeah and I mean there are probably lots of people who think oh maybe some like historian is going to appreciate you know my game the way that van Go's art was only appreciated after he shot himself in the chest with a revolver and like years had passed and people just oh who's this V go guy right like but that is extremely unlikely for every van go there's probably thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of artists who just died in obscurity and are still obscure right so it's a dice roll yeah so so I mean uh sounds like you've taken a very pragmatic approach toward game development um one thing that I want to talk about is distribution so we talked about like um the role of you know Tik Tok YouTube shorts Instagram reals there's this saying that like firsttime Founders focus on technology second time Founders focus on distribution how how do you distribute your game how do you get it in front of people obviously you talked about short firm video but but like what are the other ways that you distribute your game and like like are you using App Stores are you um do you have a mailing list are you like how do you get it your game out there and get people playing it I think I've came to a realization not too long ago that all of my games moving forward are going to be on the App Store and this is Apple and and Google App Store correct correct and the reason why is because it just matches so much with kind of my business model as it already is like a lot of people come to my YouTube channel and they watch my videos for free and then you know a small percentage they'll donate or they'll buy merch right but the majority in whole they expect free content and this is what the app stores are predominantly operated on it's like free apps and so I found that it's just a good fit where if I make free videos and I I I'm really lucky that I have an audience that I can make content for right like I have my own audience that I can show ads to I don't have to pay anyone right right which I'll get into that a little bit but in a little bit but just to wrap this Sor I have so many put all together I'm excited I'm taking notes um so so so again so the business model I've been operating on for a long time is free videos is what people expect so it only makes sense that like hey here's a free video also here's a free app that you can play in the meantime while you wait for the next video right and the reason why I think that the App Store themselves are good is because they promote apps based on their performance of people playing it of people downloading it Etc versus you look at some other stores like Steam for example they promote apps based on how they sell you see so there's a bit of a disconnect on my current business model and how Steam Works not saying it's impossible to make a successful game um from your YouTube audience but it just makes more sense that I have a free app that I can send my audience to and funneling traffic to my app is measured uh is is a key performance indicator for these app stores to then push it even further so it's just like extra boost if you will okay interesting so so essentially external traffic to an app uh will give like like Google's app store or Apple's App Store and their like top app leaderboard of the week and all that stuff like you can get a lot of additional juice out of like maybe the same number of people just because of the type of traffic that's coming to the app and if it's external that's interesting to note okay yeah I didn't know that and and the thing is like I don't even need someone to play the game more than an hour you know all I need is the download and then the app stores pick that up and they say okay there's some interest here we're going to promote this to people who don't even know who J Bros is you know yeah you say more than an hour because steam you you can get a refund if you play it less than a certain amount of time right so a lot of people refund it yeah yeah sorry I didn't mean to interrupt your flow they can well well I mean look that's actually another good point as well right like I think it's eight hours if you play before 8 hours you get a refund which means that you have to create a game that has more than eight hours of content which is not easy you know and if you're you're if you're a fulltime content Creator and you're trying to launch a game on Steam you need to make a game that has more than eight hours of confident so that people don't game the system and get their money back right you know again I'm not saying that it's bad I'm not saying launching games on steams is bad I just think that launching games on in app store is just far more optimal for the business model of a content creator uh like a YouTube content creator yeah interesting so uh not to mention the accessibility as well yeah accessibility one thing I learned one thing I learned transitioning to doing mobile apps is how simple it is for people to play the app I used to do Steam games and there would be so many different things oh I need a coordinate a time oh is it is it this system or that system oh my PC specs aren't good enough right when I've been doing mobile apps I've doing play testing I say hey here's the app link in three minutes they have it downloaded ready to play I mean you've even done some live streams where you're like here download this app and like let's play it and like those streams are great like your who's the AI game I can't remember the exact name yeah yeah where you got like video coming soon yeah so different um different ideas like that you can iterate on them so quickly and your audience can get into the game and once they've played one game that like breaks a barrier where they're like okay next time he's doing a live stream I'm going to download the game and interact right there these multiplayer games so cool so uh let's say hypothetically you didn't have the uh YouTube following that you have how would you dist your game would you still stick mostly to the App Stores yeah I think app stores is the best way to go in terms of someone I don't know I I'm still thinking about like app stores versus steam yeah like this is a relatively new discovery for me I'm still thinking about it but at this moment I feel that app stores are they are the future there are limitations you can't really create every experience with an app but I think you can create most experiences with an app and and the reason why I would suggest someone who doesn't have an audience to use an app store is because you have a greater probability of getting promoted with on the App Stores literally the the key performance indicator for steam is sales yeah so if you don't have an audience already you make a game you put up on Steam and you don't get any sales you're just not going to get seen yeah but if you can if you publish an app on Google Play or the app store or the Apple App Store and you create a Tik Tok or something and the Tik Tok gets some traction and you get people to go download your game that is a key performance indicator that will be looked at and you will get extra promotion so it it just makes sense you know yeah okay I think yeah that's really that explains why a lot of the most Innovative games I've seen are on mobile formats even though a lot of Hardcore Gamers cringe and bristle at the notion of playing a game on their phone when they've got like you know a $2,000 PC with like a fancy graphics card and they got like all their ergonomic stuff set up at their desk so moving on from distribution I want to talk about like game design as a field and one of the things that's so interesting to me is like the games you're developing are very different from other games uh like almost like genre Less in a way or like if there is a genre it's very you know specific like I we we saw the rise of lots of different genres of games such as like Tower Defense games for example or um you know like obviously realtime strategy games have been around for long a long time but before video games reached a certain level of sophistication the notion of a realtime strategy game where you controlled a whole lot of different units and a whole lot you were like making so many decisions like that had to come from somewhere right firstperson shooters uh like like Doom had to come from somewhere and they came from the idea of from the mind of a few developers probably sketching things out on whiteboards probably building really coarse prototypes right even sides scrollers like the original rcade games had the strength that they couldn't scroll because it was too graphically intensive now you can I mean I want to say you can do basically anything with the computational power of like an iPhone or an Android like do you think we'll ever exhaust the design space for games and interactive experiences no I don't think so I so there's a game that came out not too long ago it's um I don't remember the name of it but it it meshes two genres together two relatively new genres together and even that I'm like we're never going to run out of ideas like there there's so many genres that you can take to this day and and just do one plus one and get two like to this day there's so much unexplored and we we are still creating new genres as the years go on so I don't think that we will you know you yeah I I can go on but I'll stop there okay and like so how do you how did you come up with the idea of having a turnbased fighting game cuz of course there's like Pokemon there are lots of like collectible card games and stuff like that there are lots of games that are turnbased uh like board games basically anything in the tabletop world is necessarily almost turnbased just because otherwise you'd have people like throwing their hands all over the table and stuff yeah how did you come up with this particular idea because people think about you know Tekken they think about Street Fighter they think about games that uh require like frame perfect inputs and stuff like that like what inspired you to go on this this route thank you for asking this question I have immense passion for uh this game this turn based fighting game then I'm making Ultra BS uh because it it mixes everything that I've kind of learned over the last like 15 years in the sense of design and the sense of code and sense of so many different things Graphics Etc but the to answer a question directly I've always been a huge fan of anime and I've played many anime games over the years but I've never been really satisfied with the anime games that I play because you watch like Goku versus Vegeta right in Dragon Ball Z and you see them doing some incredible things that you just wish you could do but then you go play a game and they have to limit you because you're playing a game in real time with the controller with a limited amount of inputs right and so having the desire to want to like really feel like Goku but also uh coming off of a chess addiction that I had yeah I realized that and I I I'm still exploring this Beyond Ultra bers I realized that I think that some of the the greatest experiences we have yet to experience are ditching real time simulation and inste in in favor of like a like a turn base or a frame by frame simulation yeah and frame by frame maybe you can describe verbally like so you're doing like a show ruken or something and it's like frame by frame it's like okay what would you like to do at this step like and so you can alter like you know all different aspects of like the combat experience and you can kind of adapt to strategies it presents like this multifaceted whereas like okay I threw a punch and they threw a punch and my punch has higher priority or my punch comes out in eight frames they're comes out in 10 frames so I win and then they there's nothing they can do once that button's been pressed and so many decisions in these you know real time fighting games like fighting games because they're all real time basically like they happen at like a the level like the human threshold for reaction time I think is like a quarter of a second right like if you have like you go to the Science Museum and they've got the the magnet thing and it holds the ruler and it drops it and you have to grab it and it like I tried it so many times I could never really get below the quarter of a second threshold M the games happen faster so you have to kind of like input and you have to come up with humanistics like oh I'm going to throw this and this and you kind of develop an intuition but you can't actually react to what's happening it's right it's kind of physiologically impossible to really react you know you you might be able to memorize exactly how to Parry you know like Chun ley's special or something like that to where you can Parry every single hit of it or something like that right but you're not going to be able to uh adapt your gameplay in real time and it sounds like what you're building gives you the opportunity to consider all those things and and it lets you step back and deliberate like a real time chess experience would be extremely boring watching two grand Masters sit at the table and think really hard for 15 minutes and make a move right like the chess clocks are like nine hours in some games right yeah but at the same time it's incredibly engaging if you're the person who's at the chest table looking at the game trying to decide what to do yeah also replays I I was really addicted to watching chess replays there's uh I think Gotham chess he does like his YouTube channel does a bunch of uh replay commentary on like really famous matches and it was so enthralling to me but I I realized that it's not going to be enthralling to everyone like you have to have an understanding of Chess to some degree and you know it's really plain Graphics um yeah there's so many things that came together for the ultra BS project I remember I was going to do a video a few years ago about um a concept in The Matrix right so you think about the Matrix you think what what would it take if we had the ability to dodge bullets right and the truth of the matter is you just would have to have a much uh a much larger iteration of time uh perception right in terms of like one yeah like one second you need to be able to perceive much faster right and I was going to make this video where you could put on a VR and and you would get shot by an agent and then I would calculate the trajectory that it's going and then just skip the time so that it puts it right in front of you so you get to react to it but then the the person who shot the gun sees you dodging it so yeah so they they can quickly adapt to where you are and like triangulate where they think you're going to go and shoot in that direction we're talking about the 1990 n classic The Matrix if anybody listening to this has not seen that movie I I mean it is literally my favorite movie I'm not exaggerating I've watched lots of movies I I think it's the most creative interesting like it holds up really well uh even today in 2024 but but sorry for the the segue like and the plot is surprisingly deep if you watch the entire Trilogy are the machines actually bad think about it you know U but uh but to get to your point like the the ability to adapt and then have your opponent adapt and like there there's there also kind of like the metag gaming like conventionally people will do this so like they can recognize the strategy and they can develop heuristics to be able to make decisions again the sort of stuff that like maybe an extremely high level fighting game player already does but they do it almost intuitively after thousands of hours of practice what if you just picking up this game could start to have that that kind of push and pull that interplay that's the exact point of ultra bers is you no longer need that thousand hours like here we're going to give it to you step by step so you can you can take all the time you need to evaluate the game State yeah you know yeah it sounds so cool man and uh you mentioned anime I'm just going to jump to that man like what inspired you a game developer to create anime to Japanese animation style uh you know cartoons essentially uh that's great question I I personally think that a lot of the best stories come from anime um I can't like I think a lot of the stories that have resonated with me to this day are like all anime stories from Cowboy bbop to to Big O to Dragon Ball like they're all anime stories and I came to a point where I wanted to tell my own story and I thought what better medium than to create a create an anime it's still in in progress It's in manga form at the moment but we we'll get to it eventually awesome corre you hiring to develop the you're actually artist and I took this the tofu car that is like the star of the uh of the show and I just was like Hey can you can you do something similar about me holding my bass playing like kind of like leaning against the car so that's the cover of the uh the uh learn to code RPG soundtrack thing but um nice nice but I've worked with artists and they're not that expensive at least the ones like it's amazing like uh you you can find artists who really take pride in their craft you can support them in their craft and you can get them to uh essentially develop art based on your prompt if you will like you've been doing that right you've been working with artists correct correct and it's been quite the journey I um you know before I did any of this I was like yeah usually I just go and tell someone who I think is talented to make some art and they do it but yeah you know they're individuals they're also entrepreneurs you know they have their own schedules and timelines and projects and dreams and aspirations and you know some are better than others unfortunately but I am lucky to have found a good group of artists that I am able to work really well with and they do really talented work and learned a lot yeah so you so you write and you come up with the characters and kind of like figure out what's correct what you want to relay to to the reader or eventually the viewer and then they help you execute on that through their skills correct correct I do all the writing character design all that stuff and uh there's a bit of a compromise you know when you when you bring anyone on any project right like they have their own fair share of say into the content just by the nature of their art style and the way they interpret things but you know it's part of the collaborative process so I I don't mind it so how would you how would you compare working with human artists to working with you know Frameworks that you're developing games on and stuff because as a as an indie Dev you're kind of like doing everything Soup To Nuts Lock Stock and Barrel right like you're you you're kind of doing I don't know if you actually develop your own assets but like maybe you could talk about like just how many different hats you wear when you're building a game versus you know collaborating with humans for art it's it's a lesson that I'm learning uh how to do less wear less of the hats yeah um once upon a time I I had this belief that you not a real creative if you didn't do the whole thing yourself once upon a time I believe that but I have I think actually thanks to the manga project and working with artists because I had no other option to because I can't draw it is taught me a lot of it has showed me like the value of working with people and so Ultra bout is actually it has I have a 3D modeler shout outs to my boy colossal cake he's doing the 3D models on that they look beautiful far better than anything I could ever do and I sorry I forgot the question you said oh yeah like what hats would you wear as a Game Dev versus now you're just writing and kind of directing I guess yeah yeah back then it's everything design it's code it's art it's sound it's music it's it's writing it's it's everything you know character design it's it's everything and I and you know what's interesting is that I think that's part of the reason why scope is so difficult is because like you have to do everything and and now that I've relinquished the art to an artist colossal cake for Ultra bers that's just one less thing that I have to worry about right so now I can I have this I have this uh like this this group of things that is like a little less heavy with the art remove that I can put more time into and help me scope things correctly awesome well I want to talk a little bit about AI That's like the thing that everybody talks about now uh there have been some really impressive advancements in AI recently we saw like Sora which is this uh um video creation tool put up by open AI um and of course we've got like image creation tools uh and we've got text creation tools you've used AI in a lot of your recent projects um let's talk a little bit about your relationship with AI and how you got how you like looked at it like this is ready for me to actually use it right because it's been around forever you know lots of people have developed things with AI over the past few years I mean you could argue that like game AI is as old as games themselves because otherwise there wouldn't be much of a game if the PacMan ghost just sat there right like yeah but what inspired you to pick up Ai and what are some of the things you've been building with it what inspired me to pick up AI once again this is a call back to the beginning of the podcast um I used to watch my mom play D Kong Country on Super Nintendo when I was young and again she had a controller and she was controlling Donkey Kong but there were agents that I I just was like who's controlling the agents who who who is controlling the the enemies the baddies and that like I think started my fascination with AI and wanting to learn more um so I get the game maker and I'm making a bunch of games and I'm learning how to do AI for the first time and once I learned how to do it well man I made so many games that like couldn't even play like I just said and watched it I had this one game quick side note that I made that was like anime shown in style bunch of Fighters they're in like an arena and I would just put it on and watch it as I fall asleep anyways that's cool I I eventually come across um Carl Sims um Evolution simulator uh demo thing and that really changed like my whole concept of what AI could be with their generative algorithm they was demonstrating obviously I had no idea how to do at the time but but that stuck in my brain for many many many many many years until finally I found unity and there's all these announcements about tensor flow you know which is a machine learning library yeah yeah and um uh now all of a sudden all these resources are available where I can learn back propagation and the various calculus things that I need and I spent eight months to learn all that stuff and then I make I basically try and make what Carl Sims made in his 1990 one demo I think it is um on YouTube and it worked it blew up and I've always had a Fascination for AI awesome I'll track down that Carl Sims demo and put it in the show notes for anybody who wants to watch it let's talk about some of the things you've built with it like I can't not talk about the amazing shark tank Shark Tank Episode generator uh this I was laughing like like practically rolling on the floor watching the video where you demoed some of it and and it's just the the show shark tank is so absurd for anybody who knows anything about business like even ad me administering a charity like the show is so absurd and ridiculous and it's not how real people invest the business advice like there might be some useful advice in there but it's it's hyper real reality TV right yeah so now imagine people are coming in with straight faces pitching things like underwear underwater shops for fish to shop at um I'm trying to remember some of the other ones but baby's first hand gun you know to absurd but they're coming in their they're do they're silent fire alarm yeah silent fire alarm like isn't it annoying when a fire alarm goes off silent fire alarm you know like pitching it as a product and having like the you know the cast of uh the Sharks I guess is what they're called like reacting to it like oh I'm out you know the cigarette that has 10x the nicotine or something like that yeah yeah like you you don't have to smoke as much cuz you get next ni easier on the ls right I mean and then uh I mean it sounds like something that would have been pitched at like the height of the ' 80s or something like that like but these are really amazing scripts and you've even kind of figured out like some rigging so that you can have like it a visual element to it like the the shark sitting back in their chair like their lips are moving as they talk and and the voices like GPT has probably read the transcripts of every single Shark Tank Episode ever so it can kind of almost nail the manner in which the Sharks would react to a given proposal if they were entertaining is is a serious proposal which none of these are yeah maybe you can talk about developing that and like what inspired you to develop that yeah I um I love shark tank it's a very entertaining show incredibly entertaining but you know kind of like what I touched on the video the best episodes of Shark Tank are the bad ideas those are always the most entertaining and it just came to me one day I was like well I want more Shark Tank episodes of bad ideas and I think we can make this happen with AI I think someone had asked me when I was talking to them about it like what if someone pitched it was some crazy idea and I was like that would be so funny and I think the initial idea was to just do it myself and I was like no no no we can make an AI algorithm to do this for us and so I started to develop it and funny enough I was actually going to stop at the 3D rendering but I remember showing it to someone they're like oh yeah this is cool I was like no what do you mean this is cool this is this is amazing and what I what I had figured out is that the idea itself was cool but the presentation was terrible in the video there's like a 3D model of the Sharks and it's like whatever presentation and so that's when I learned that like I need to take it further and so I got a bunch of different libraries to make them like the face driving and whatnot and then I showed that to the same person like oh I love this is amazing I want to see more right so rapidly iterating essentially uh as you got feedback and just thinking like hey I could use AI for this I'm sure a lot of developers are kind of like working on things and they're like wait a second I need to generate a whole lot of scripts and I don't want if I write them myself they probably won't be as funny as what GPT creates anyway yeah um because again it's read everything it's read every Reddit post it's read every book in the Library of Congress like it has the context to be able to come up with stuff and it's very useful in that regard so maybe we could talk a little bit about um Ai and what what you think is likely to disrupt you did a recent kind of tier list of jobs you think are likely to be disrupted by Ai and very controversial yeah yeah I'm sure it's controversial because I think a lot of people greatly overestimate the capability of AI and they see like this big step change and they think that like oh the next big step change is just around the corner and then next thing you know we're in like you know lawnmower man or something I don't know but maybe you could talk about like um your tier list and like EXC where you put different jobs and then what proved to be the most controversial all of it all of it's controversial apparently um yeah I I don't remember specifically a lot of them to be honest but I I do know that I got a comment like an hour ago of someone talking about how delusional I am thinking that factory workers won't be replaced and so I I replied to them and say okay just to make sure I understand what you're saying you're saying that the 200,000 Factory workers who work on the iPhone are going to be replaced within 5 10 years and then his reply was like well I think about 180,000 of them are going to be replaced in 51 years I'm just like how do we get here yeah how do we get here that is an absurd claim 51 years 180,000 Factory workers will be replaced to make an iPhone like that that is so absurd yeah that is so absurd like when we get into like the actual economics of it it's like how much does that cost I was lucky enough I did a tour uh of one of Amazon's robot facilities and Amazon I think they have like a $ 1.6 trillion do market cap or something like that and they were showing us Rob robots that were in beta you know and this person is talking about we replace 180 it's just it's just crazy to me I don't know I don't I I I have an idea how we got here scifi is really appealing and you know oftentimes we don't even think too deeply about like the economics and actual effects of these things but you know yeah it is what it is I guess so do you think people greatly overestimate like like the the most common thing I hear the most common question I get an email about it people who've listened to more than one episode of the freeo camp podcast will no doubt be like oh quiz's going to talk about it again but I am because it's important people write me every single day hey should I still learn the code or is my job going to be completely automated and uh yeah what what would you say to to some whipper snapper who's like jail should I still learn Game Dev or is Game Dev just going to be automated in 5 years um so I I do think that there is a probability that it will be automated at some point I think 51 years is too short of a time scale um I can get into why but before I do that before I do that I I again I always like to like ground these things and economics right if I am going to go make the next Facebook or what they call it meta or whatever they call it and I want to hire an AI to do my to be my fulltime programmer right the real question is how much does that cost in API Keys like how much does it cost right now if I want a full team of AI programmers how much does that cost like these are real questions that we need to ask right and then furthermore right we can keep going if an AI um programmer makes a mistake like a fund Al foundational mistake within the code and doesn't report it who do we blame you know like there's so many questions that we need to explore that I think that we're so far away especially someone that's been working with these tools uh on a daily basis building actual products with it there's so many foundational errors not saying it can't get better but I I I think that there's an element of language that we as humans don't even understand and to see the um to see that understanding uh being implemented in these AI language models within the next 5 10 years when we don't even understand it I think it's a little absurd but yeah and what I think are the things that you've been most impressed by with tools like gbd4 that that you're like oh this is genuinely useful and this saved me a whole lot of time yeah don't get me wrong I think GPT Chad GPT is like one of the most foundational like amazing products of the last 30 years I think it's amazing however I just always like to push back on like you guys think the show like it's it's it's not going to do all that the things that you think it's going to do at least not right now um but in terms of like what I use it for I use it for virtually everything man if I'm making a video I go asking for some advice uh if I am working on a game feature I'll ask it for advice or even code um if I'm having problems my relationship I'll ask for advice if there's some news article I'll say hey can you summarize this formula I use it for almost everything to be honest with you yeah and it improves your productivity your personal productivity and I think that's one of the things you struck at in the the video is it's going to improve the productivity of lawyers but it's not going to replace lawyers heaven forbid we have you I mean I can only imagine like all the you know lawsuits and all all the economic waste that would come from delegating that when you could just hire a lawyer who yes they're expensive but these are important decisions right um yeah yeah so very important to yeah and and I would say like you know a doctor a lawyer like I don't think that those jobs are like and I think software engineer is also in that category because software engineer makes a mistake and a plane falls out of the sky you know like yeah you're going to want actual people working on some of those things I guess the the main question I have for you is are the fields not complete replacement which was what your video was about but do you think that an individual developer could become so productive by leveraging all these tools that you just need fewer developers yeah I think that's definitely possible and I I would be surprised if it's not already happening to be honest um but I mean but I the question I always have is like what is that what is that saying and what are you trying to say not you personally coinci but like someone who make puts forward this argument are you saying that we should stop AI technology because it makes people more productive like that's not in the human Spirit you know we for a millennia have been creating tools to further our production right um I personally find arguments like that when we talk about displacement right instead of replacement I find that to be very telling on like the individual you know learn these tools man they're not that difficult you know yeah I mean in in my opinion tools are getting easier to learn every day like it's getting easier and easier to learn how to code for example to learn how to be a database administrator to learn how to do devops um yeah the tools are improving so I just want to wrap up with a few quick questions uh that I'm excited to ask you are you like inspired by like Hong Kong Kung Fu dubbing or something like why is it so many of your videos you're like hey how's it going you know like I love that it's so funny and I I I haven't seen any other creators do that is that common am I just missing out on like a genre of you know videos or is that distinctly you um I don't think I've came across any other creators that do that so just to describe it like verbally for for people that aren't watching the video like when you watch a ja video he'll be like eating pizza and like his voice sounds totally clear it doesn't sound like he's eating pizza but he's obviously eating pizza and like doing these very exaggerated movements and stuff it's so Charming uh and it's so there's like this weird kind of Disconnect but like I'm watching jabril but I'm not you know I'm listening to a different jbril like in a different time why doesn't he sync it up it it also seems like a huge time save because you can just just gesticulate and do whatever and then you can have that almost as like broll from when you're actually recording your fil your videos right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's yeah so the the inspiration for it before I used to make my videos uh like reading scripts like I would dead pan just read a script but it took so much time it took a lot of time retaking and I don't say a word properly and one day I was watching a video it was like some kid he was doing like a commentary with gameplay footage on screen I was like this is so brain dead simple why can't I do this I like wait I can do this you know except for I'm Just a Little More egotistical I need my face on screen so I just use my face in lie of the gameplay footage um but I don't do that anymore unfortunately it it it got to a point where it was like a highlight for a lot of people to the point where like I'm overthinking so many takes and it ended up taking a lot more time than it used to so I kind of I found a new way that's faster to make videos yeah I get comments every single day what's your new faster way just out of curiosity yeah so my my latest way is I will go on uh green screen and just basically just Rift yeah just just start going basically yeah just just Rift I'll have like bullet points on what I want to touch on but I'll just Rift in front of a green screen yeah uh and then I'll I'll film clips here and there throughout the process uh just doing like commentary that I can play if need be yeah that's cool so um at the end of your free cocaine course the course that you published uh on math or on uh computer science like basically programming 101 you say remember to always always feed your curiosity you say that's the final most important rule can you true explain what you mean by feed your curiosity and why it's so important yeah that used to be my Mantra I used to always say it at theend of the videos I have it at the end of my description still but yeah so the the whole concept behind that is I I think it was really important it was a lesson that I learned pretty young that there there's so many like things that we can do in a in a lifetime but if you don't if you don't follow the things that make you curious if you don't feed that Curiosity you you will you'll never end up where you need or you deserve to be and it was just something that I like to say just to remind people that like yeah you might get curious about code you might get curious about whatever it is Graphics or sports or whatever it is take that action feed that Curiosity find out if you actually like it or not because you never know where it might lead you you know I would not be here today if it was for me feeding my insatiable curiosity yeah you might be working at Joanne's Fabric Store hey I could be working at Joann's Fabric Store it's a good call back yeah so what are you focused on now obviously uh you've got uh hackware can you talk about that real quick and also like your hacks like kind of like logo that's on your beanie here yeah very distinctive uh kind of like handdrawn almost like street art style oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so Hax is the it's very boring but it's just like the company that I use for legal stuff um but tax wear is the IP that I've been building out um I have a really really good story that I cannot wait to tell I wish I can do it faster if I could I would um but hack SAR is the IP and then hack is just like the business that I do merch and anytime I show up I don't know I I haven't really thought too much about hack but it's it's the business and the merchant the hackware it's a it's like a large like intellectual property you say IP like almost like a franchise or like a universe of characters and stories like you would think of like the Star Wars universe or something like that this is a big project it's like a multiyear Endeavor it's huge it's it's humongous it's humongous I've been writing it since 2019 wow it's humongous I wish I can get content out faster but is there like things anything you could say to describe it Beyond just like the name and like those posters behind you like what is it about sure sure so it's a it's a Galaxy um in which uh it's based on Shonen um battles so sh being like the like shou and in uh like the the young kid basically or like young years small years I think is literally how it translates and it's a style of manga like if you ever heard of like Shen jump or some of those uh manga that you can get from Japan that often are translated into English uh it's basically like a style of anime that's all about like mostly young men like kind of overcoming Their Fear and like leveling themselves up is the best way I could describe it is that a good description though yeah I think it's a fair enough description I think the description I like to use nowadays is it's uh story progression through fighting that's that's like the best way I like f like challenges like if you watch like uh for example uh Demon Slayer like it's like he goes from fighting like having to like slice the boulder in half to like finding progressively higher level demons um and and that that kind of uh yeah but go ahead yeah so so that that that's what has inspired me I love Shonen so much and that is the that that's at the center of of what the IP is but there are so many really good stories that like I've experienced that I've taken from other people um I I plan to bring out some other writers to tell some of their stories as well and just it's a Galaxy in which like all of this uh is contained in and the first story that I'm starting with it's haware Paragon it's that's the manga and it's about a young man Jinzo or two young men Jinzo and Swift who are from a little desolate planet and they have this dream to become a great fighter very cliche I understand but it's about the journey that they take that is the real interesting part um and so they're up against the the place that they live doesn't have a lot of resources so they don't have access to like you know work a job and and whatnot so they resort to Crime to make their money they're up against law enforcement they're up against um uh the generational um Authority that came before them uh they're up against themselves and they have to figure out how do they overcome the situation and that is the Lynch pin for the hack for IP but I I have so many stories that I've written and I honestly can't wait to tell and just I got to figure out the best way to get those story out yeah and so you're thinking it's going to be a manga and then ultimately like an anime or are you going to make it an interactive experience I'm still trying to figure it out I I started with the first thing I made was a um audio book because it was simple and easy to get it up and running but like people don't really care about audio books is what I learned and so I did a manga but now the manga's taking a while so I'm thinking about doing like an app type thing yeah like maybe a visual novel or something that's the medium we chose I mean it's not as exciting I think but maybe like a voiced visual novel could be like a good compromise where you could just get still images instead of having like animation you're doing so many frames it like exponentially balloons and cost right yeah yeah well we haven't done any animation yet we still have the manga but yeah yeah so there's a lot of lot of really good stories that I'm really excited to tell um we also have a video game that is being released in this IP as well hackware enforcer games haware enforcer very cool yeah and uh so would you say that's like your like long run like your longterm Vision like how like the next 5 10 years is that a huge part of your professional life uh I hope so I hope so I think if I'm looking long term I just really want to tell this story and just have the story out here I I one of my favorite stories I'm sorry one of my favorite IPS of all time is XMen and it didn't become my favorite IP until I learned about its inspiration it was Stanley's commentary on civil rights and when I learned that it overnight the value of XMen changed for me and that is just the power of Storytelling I believe and so like that that that's what I want to do is want to tell a really good story that is fun entertaining but also like really says something you know yeah absolutely man I'm a huge XMen fan uh I'm actually watching the animated series with my kids uh the the old one didn't they reboot it Xmen is not a reboot it's a continuation they just pick up where they left off really yeah it's called XMen 97 and it literally takes like the last episode and just goes right into yeah like it never ended oh I never knew that so I don't I just learned about this from Leon Noel 100 dev's founder a few days ago like literally last last week is when I learned about it so uh yeah that that interview is probably live by the time anybody's listening to this but we do talk a lot about XMen he's a big XMen fan too he said he literally cried when he saw the trailer for the new one yeah he was that excited about it it's a real fan yeah awesome man well it's been such an a privilege taking nearly two hours of your time hanging out with you Jael I'm going to add links to a lot of your different projects um in the show notes everyone be sure to check these out be sure to follow Jail's YouTube channel check out some of his back catalog of hilarious videos check out his new AI tool toy your your friend your AI friend that you like physically bring around with you that was amazing gibot yeah yeah check that out and um I just really appreciate you making time to join us man thank you for having me I I truly appreciate it and thanks for everything you guys are doing for the community honestly yeah well everybody until next week happy coding
