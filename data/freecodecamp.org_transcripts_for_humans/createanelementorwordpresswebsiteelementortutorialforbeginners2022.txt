00:00 - in this course you will learn how to
00:01 - create a custom website without any code
00:04 - using elementor and wordpress i'm beau
00:07 - with freecodecamp.org
00:09 - i've created a few popular wordpress
00:11 - courses and this one is specifically
00:13 - focused on elementor elementor is a free
00:16 - wordpress website builder and this
00:19 - course is all you need to learn how to
00:21 - build a bunch of different types of
00:22 - websites and you don't need any prior
00:25 - experience to follow along you will
00:27 - learn a drag and drop system that allows
00:30 - for easy and limitless customization so
00:33 - you can build the perfect website for
00:34 - your needs and the website will look
00:36 - great on both desktop and mobile so
00:39 - let's get started the first step is to
00:41 - get a domain name and hosting we'll be
00:44 - getting that at hostinger.com but you
00:46 - can still follow along if you use a
00:48 - different hosting provider hostinger
00:50 - provided a grant that made this course
00:52 - possible but i had already used
00:54 - hostinger personally in the past and had
00:56 - a good experience hostinger is optimized
00:59 - for wordpress sites and has a 99.9
01:02 - uptime guarantee
01:04 - they also give you a free domain and
01:06 - free ssl so we can just go here get
01:09 - click get started
01:11 - and then you can decide whether you're
01:12 - going to create a brand new website or
01:14 - transfer an existing website well we're
01:16 - creating a brand new website
01:18 - and
01:19 - you can you don't have to go through all
01:21 - this but we are doing a wordpress here
01:24 - and i'm just going to
01:27 - go through here and it'll tell you what
01:28 - kind of package we want to do so
01:32 - we can just
01:33 - skip this for now because this is
01:36 - actually an upgrade but we don't want to
01:37 - upgrade so i'll just go to skip here
01:41 - and then it's going to recommend the
01:42 - premium shared hosting plan so
01:45 - you can actually go and just select your
01:47 - plan manually but this will help you
01:50 - figure out the exact plan you want you
01:52 - can see right here you can actually host
01:54 - a hundred different websites on this
01:55 - plan and you get a good amount of
01:57 - storage and you get unlimited bandwidth
02:00 - so that's pretty good you includes a
02:02 - free domain
02:03 - and then ssl will make it so you have a
02:06 - secure website so this is a good option
02:09 - so i'm just going to select that
02:12 - and then it's going to show where you
02:14 - can actually upgrade if you want or you
02:16 - you can choose a different amount of
02:19 - months
02:20 - and you can see depending on how many
02:21 - months you buy a time is is how much
02:23 - it's going to renew for so you can see
02:26 - this one
02:27 - renews at 699 799 899 or 11.99 a month
02:31 - so just pick whatever one you think is
02:33 - gonna work best for you if you're just
02:35 - testing it out you could just do a the
02:37 - one month plan or if you know you're
02:39 - going to have a website long term you
02:41 - can do one of these other plans and then
02:44 - um after you get all this set up you can
02:46 - go through just to create the account
02:48 - and you can select your payment and then
02:51 - you can submit it so i'm not actually
02:54 - going to type in everything but it's
02:55 - pretty straightforward if you're going
02:57 - to create your own account for the first
02:59 - time
03:01 - so after you get logged in and possibly
03:03 - as part of creating your account you're
03:06 - going to want to get your domain so if
03:09 - you're done creating your account and
03:10 - you haven't gotten a domain through that
03:12 - process yet we can just click on claim
03:16 - domain right in the main menu
03:18 - now here is you you're going to have to
03:20 - have a domain name that's never been
03:22 - used before
03:24 - it could take you a few tries to find
03:26 - one that's not already taken but i'm
03:28 - going to go with
03:30 - b-e-a-u with the dashes that's my name
03:32 - bo but my name doesn't have dashes but
03:34 - o.net let's check availability
03:37 - and i already tested this so i knew it
03:39 - knew it would work
03:40 - and i will claim domain
03:45 - okay
03:46 - now we have to set up this domain
03:48 - registration details
03:53 - and we'll just finish filling this out
03:57 - okay the domain is registered
04:01 - okay now add the website to the hosting
04:04 - plan
04:06 - and i already had this hosting plan
04:08 - registered for this other website so
04:10 - select that one
04:16 - website connected successfully
04:19 - now i'll show you how to set up an email
04:21 - account on your domain through hostinger
04:24 - so i'm on the hostinger home tab
04:27 - after i'm logged in and i'm going to
04:28 - just click emails
04:30 - and now i'm going to the so i already
04:33 - set up this one before but now i'm going
04:35 - to set the email on the domain we just
04:37 - created so i'm just going to click there
04:39 - and then create email account
04:42 - and then i'm just going to
04:45 - type in it automatically filled in
04:47 - something but i can type in anything i
04:49 - want so i'm going to put bow and then
04:51 - i'm just going to type in a password
04:53 - here
04:54 - and then create
04:57 - okay so now people can email me at bo b
05:00 - dash e a dash u.net
05:03 - and then i can access the email by still
05:06 - being on this email tab here and going
05:08 - to webmail
05:10 - and then i'll just sign in here
05:14 - and there are no messages but i can
05:17 - always compose a new message here and
05:19 - then i'll receive messages if someone
05:21 - sends me a message
05:23 - and now let's go over how to set up ssl
05:26 - for the website so i'm going to go to
05:28 - the ssl tab on this hosting or dashboard
05:31 - and ssl is important it makes sure all
05:35 - data coming and going from your website
05:37 - is secure and nobody's going to be able
05:40 - to
05:41 - there there won't be any hackers or
05:43 - anybody that can see what's going on
05:44 - with the website if someone submits
05:46 - information it'll be secure nobody will
05:48 - be able to see what that information is
05:50 - so i'm just going to click the install
05:52 - ssl button and then i'm going to select
05:54 - the website and just click install ssl
05:58 - and the great thing is that it's it's
06:00 - free it's completely included
06:02 - within hosting or within the plan and
06:04 - now i should have ssl but i'm going to
06:06 - actually do this drop down menu to go to
06:08 - the bow.net to see the one that we just
06:10 - added
06:12 - and you can see it's installing it says
06:14 - it may take up to an hour but then after
06:16 - that
06:18 - we can go to the website instead of
06:19 - going to http colon slash bo.net it will
06:22 - be http s
06:24 - colon slash bo.net because it has the
06:27 - ssl it's the the s stands for secure
06:30 - i'll go back to the dashboard
06:32 - now i want to get wordpress installed on
06:33 - the website many different website
06:36 - hosting services allow you to easily
06:38 - install wordpress on the website so the
06:42 - exact method could be different if
06:44 - you're not using hostinger but it should
06:46 - be relatively similar so i'm just going
06:48 - to scroll down on this page here and i'm
06:51 - going to click
06:52 - wordpress
06:55 - and then i'm going to install wordpress
07:00 - and i'll fill this out to finish setting
07:02 - up so let's call it
07:04 - my website for now and anything here can
07:07 - be changed later
07:09 - and then i'll put in the password
07:11 - [Music]
07:13 - and then i'll just use these default
07:15 - settings here and click install
07:21 - we're on the hostinger dashboard
07:24 - but we want to go to the wordpress
07:26 - dashboard so we can start creating our
07:28 - wordpress website so i'll just click on
07:31 - edit website
07:33 - if you're using something besides beside
07:35 - wordpress there'll be something similar
07:36 - to get into the wordpress dashboard
07:39 - another way you can always access your
07:41 - wordpress dashboard if you look in the
07:44 - url bar here we have the url name and
07:47 - then it's slash wp-admin
07:51 - you can always go to slash wp-admin to
07:53 - get to your wordpress dashboard
07:56 - okay i've zoomed in a little bit on this
07:58 - and we're just going to look at some of
08:00 - the things on the menu over here these
08:02 - are all things that are important when
08:04 - creating a wordpress page we have our
08:06 - posts when we're going to create a new
08:08 - post but you're likely going to be
08:10 - creating a new page like the about us
08:13 - page contact page and stuff like that
08:15 - and we'll be going over that more later
08:18 - and you can also change your appearance
08:20 - and there's just a bunch of other
08:21 - sections here many of which will be
08:23 - going over in more detail later in this
08:26 - tutorial but first of all let's go over
08:29 - to users and you just want to make sure
08:32 - that you have a
08:34 - a password we just want to make sure
08:36 - that the password is the password we
08:38 - chose now depending on how you installed
08:41 - wordpress you may not have created a
08:43 - password and depending on what hosting
08:46 - provider you use and you just might want
08:47 - to make maybe verify that you're not
08:49 - going to have a default password so i'm
08:51 - just going to type in a password here
08:56 - and then
08:58 - i'm going to do update profile
09:00 - okay now we're going to go to the
09:03 - plugins tab
09:05 - before we deal with the plugins let's
09:07 - just get rid of some of these tabs i'm
09:08 - going to
09:09 - click x here we don't need this i guess
09:12 - they're not tabs they're just
09:13 - information boxes
09:15 - and to get rid of this one we're going
09:16 - to go through and actually delete some
09:18 - of the extra plugins here we don't a lot
09:21 - of these plugins we don't actually need
09:28 - so i've selected all the extra plugins
09:30 - and i don't need this one either
09:32 - and i'm going to go
09:34 - to oh first i'll do deactivate
09:40 - and then i'll just select them again and
09:42 - i'm going to go to delete
09:48 - and don't worry if you accidentally
09:50 - delete a plug-in that you actually need
09:52 - because it's really easy to
09:54 - reinstall them so i'm going to go to
09:56 - delete
10:02 - okay and now we've deleted all the
10:04 - plugins we don't need and you can see we
10:06 - no longer have the extra information box
10:09 - up here those associated with a
10:10 - particular pro plugin so now i'm going
10:12 - to go to add new
10:15 - this is an elementor tutorial so we
10:17 - could just install directly like this by
10:20 - searching for
10:21 - elementor
10:25 - and then we could click install now but
10:27 - we're actually going to
10:28 - install it a little differently we're
10:31 - going to install something else that
10:32 - will in turn install elementor it will
10:35 - install some themes it will install some
10:38 - templates and so we'll get everything in
10:41 - one by installing one thing so instead
10:44 - i'm going to search for starter starter
10:46 - templates
10:48 - [Music]
10:52 - okay this is going to install elementor
10:55 - plus a few other things that are going
10:57 - to be helpful so i'm just going to click
10:59 - install now
11:03 - and activate
11:08 - so let me go here down here and click
11:10 - see library
11:13 - and we don't need to watch this video
11:14 - here i'm going to click on build your
11:16 - website now
11:18 - and then you can click which plate you
11:19 - can choose what page builder you're
11:21 - going to use so in this tutorial we're
11:23 - learning about elementor so i'll click
11:24 - elementor
11:25 - and then it's going to give you a list
11:28 - of templates you can use
11:30 - so you can see some of these are premium
11:33 - so you get to pay extra for but there is
11:35 - a bunch of really good free templates
11:38 - and i highly recommend starting your
11:41 - website by using a template and then you
11:44 - can customize the template to meet your
11:46 - specific needs
11:48 - so go through and look at these
11:50 - templates and try to see what template
11:53 - looks closest to the website that you
11:56 - want to make
11:57 - and then you can modify that template to
12:01 - meet your specific needs
12:03 - so i'm going to choose this one but keep
12:06 - in mind everything is super customizable
12:09 - so no matter what one you choose you're
12:12 - going to be able to add sections remove
12:14 - sections
12:15 - change colors change pictures to make it
12:18 - so it meets your needs so i'm going to
12:20 - click this one here
12:23 - and it's already
12:25 - showing how we can customize things by
12:27 - adding a logo and different things like
12:28 - that but we're going to do all of that
12:30 - later so i'm going to do skip and
12:32 - continue
12:33 - and it's going to
12:35 - show you can actually
12:38 - choose different colors and fonts but
12:40 - again we're just going to do all this
12:42 - later because we just want to get the
12:44 - template installed on our wordpress
12:46 - instance and then we'll do all the
12:48 - customization later so it says one last
12:51 - step
12:52 - and then we can choose some of these
12:54 - advanced options so we are going to
12:57 - install this theme to go along with it
12:59 - the astra theme and the customizer
13:02 - settings we're just going to keep all
13:03 - these checked except i don't want to
13:05 - share any data and then import content
13:08 - this is this will import dummy pages
13:10 - posts images and menus so we could
13:14 - uncheck it if you want to do everything
13:16 - from scratch but i like starting with
13:18 - things and it's easier to change things
13:21 - once you once you start with something
13:23 - so i'm going to click submit and build
13:25 - the res the website and you notice i
13:27 - didn't even have to put in any
13:29 - information about my name or my email
13:30 - address or anything like that
13:41 - okay the website is ready i'll go to
13:43 - view your website
13:46 - and this is the website
13:49 - so it basically just installed
13:51 - everything all the the sample images and
13:54 - stuff like that and you can see there's
13:56 - different sections the home about
13:59 - services
14:00 - and the great thing about this is we can
14:02 - edit everything this doesn't have to be
14:05 - a services page we can make this into
14:08 - anything it can be a product page it can
14:10 - be a more information page
14:13 - maybe it could show a list of different
14:15 - people that worked at our company so
14:18 - we're going to be able to update all
14:20 - this stuff to meet our specific needs
14:25 - and you can see right now these are all
14:27 - dummy links if i click start a project
14:29 - it doesn't do anything
14:30 - and we have a contact page here
14:35 - so let's see how we can start updating
14:37 - this website using elementor to be the
14:41 - exact website we need for our project
14:45 - and so we can't edit anything right now
14:48 - this is just the view mode but to edit
14:50 - it we can go to edit with elementor
14:54 - just click edit with elementor
14:58 - and it's going to load that
15:01 - and now we have the site right here but
15:04 - then we also have the elementor editing
15:07 - menu over here and this is what we're
15:09 - going to use to add sections modify
15:12 - sections
15:14 - and just
15:15 - make the website be exactly what we want
15:17 - to be using elementor
15:19 - so first of all we have the navigator
15:22 - here which will help us select different
15:24 - sections on our website so here's the
15:26 - first section right here and then here
15:29 - it's going to go to the second section
15:31 - and you can see whenever you select a
15:33 - section it's going to put a blue outline
15:36 - around it so you can see this blue here
15:39 - here this blue line around the outline
15:42 - and then you can see you can select the
15:45 - section with these buttons here
15:48 - this is how you would add a new section
15:50 - and i can just delete that with this x
15:52 - here
15:53 - or you can delete a section or if i
15:55 - click here
15:58 - this is how i would move the section
16:00 - around
16:03 - so this we can select down here the
16:05 - bottom section but we don't even need
16:06 - the navigator i'm going to close the
16:08 - navigator because you can select a
16:10 - selection just by clicking on it so when
16:12 - i move my mouse over a section you can
16:15 - see the blue outline goes around that
16:17 - section
16:18 - and i already showed you that if you
16:20 - click the plus button you can add a new
16:22 - section and then we can bring over
16:25 - widgets so i'm actually going to go over
16:27 - here
16:28 - and get to the elements tab here and
16:31 - these are all widgets i can bring in so
16:33 - i can bring in an image i'll drag this
16:35 - image in here
16:36 - and then it's going to this is like the
16:38 - default thing here but i can actually
16:41 - choose an image and there's already
16:43 - images here that came with the website
16:46 - i'll be showing you how to add more
16:47 - later but like for example i could add a
16:50 - picture of this man and then it will
16:53 - be right here now obviously that's not
16:56 - really what we want so i'll x this here
16:59 - but let me show you one thing another
17:01 - thing is that there are often different
17:04 - columns
17:06 - so when we first create a section there
17:08 - is just one big
17:10 - column but if i click the plus button i
17:13 - can choose the structure is it just me
17:15 - one big area are there going to be two
17:17 - columns three columns four columns and
17:19 - you can see what if i want a small
17:21 - section here and a big section over here
17:24 - you can change the size by dragging this
17:26 - around here and then you can add
17:28 - different things to different sections
17:30 - so if i click the plus button that's
17:32 - going to bring up these different
17:33 - widgets
17:34 - and like i already showed you had an
17:36 - image but maybe we want to add a heading
17:40 - here
17:41 - and then after the heading you may want
17:43 - to add something after the heading so if
17:45 - i
17:46 - go back to these widgets i may want to
17:49 - add a text so we have the heading and we
17:51 - have the text here and over here we may
17:53 - want to add a video and when you edit
17:56 - video you can link to a specific youtube
18:00 - video or you can
18:02 - choose a few different sources including
18:04 - self-hosted so there's just quite a few
18:07 - different things you can do by adding
18:09 - different sections and different widgets
18:13 - and soon i'll be going into more detail
18:15 - about more things you can do with these
18:17 - sections in these widgets and show you
18:19 - how and then i'll show you how to modify
18:21 - the current sections on the website so
18:23 - i'm going to delete this extra section
18:25 - now and i wanted to show you one other
18:27 - cool thing about starting with a
18:30 - template like this
18:31 - it's already set up to be responsive so
18:35 - if i click this here there's a button on
18:36 - here says responsive mode and then i can
18:39 - choose am i do i want to look at it like
18:41 - it's a desktop a tablet or a mobile
18:43 - device i'm going to click mobile device
18:45 - so you can see as i scroll down
18:47 - everything gets drunk into a
18:50 - uh one column that's going to look
18:52 - better on a mobile device i can go back
18:54 - to the desktop site
18:57 - and if i'm done testing out these
18:59 - different sizes i can just hit x here
19:02 - now we're going to actually start
19:03 - customizing this page to meet our needs
19:07 - first of all we can always preview
19:08 - changes so we haven't made any changes
19:10 - but you can always go back to the main
19:11 - page by going preview changes i'm going
19:13 - to go back to the home and i'm going to
19:16 - just click edit with elementor again
19:19 - and so now we're at the at the home page
19:21 - again
19:22 - and you can customize
19:25 - the website to be any type of page it
19:28 - can be a blog it can be a business page
19:32 - it can be an online store
19:35 - there's tons of possibilities an
19:36 - elementor can basically make any type of
19:39 - page you want to make it
19:40 - and just for fun we're going to
19:41 - customize this page so it's a store that
19:44 - sells unicycles like i said you can make
19:47 - yours anything you like so let's look at
19:50 - this text here
19:52 - so
19:53 - for one you can easily change any text
19:56 - you see on the screen so i can say
19:59 - unicycles we all love unicycles there we
20:02 - go and then let's say we don't we want a
20:05 - different font if you want a different
20:07 - font there's a few ways to go about it
20:10 - you can select the text you can go to
20:12 - style and then i can go to typography
20:15 - and i can go to here and i can change to
20:19 - a different font here so i could change
20:22 - change it to
20:24 - verdana
20:28 - or times new roman
20:31 - or i can basically i can choose any font
20:33 - here there's even these google fonts
20:36 - here you can actually load any fonts
20:39 - from google fonts
20:40 - but let's say we know that we want all
20:43 - our fonts to be the same you may not so
20:46 - this is the way where you would do it
20:47 - individually you could select every
20:48 - single text box and change that font but
20:52 - there's also a way to change all of the
20:54 - fonts at once so i'm going to go back to
20:56 - default here and now i'm going to go to
20:59 - content or i'm going to click this
21:01 - hamburger menu and go to site settings
21:04 - so then i'm going to go to typography
21:07 - and now we're going to change the
21:08 - typography for the entire site
21:11 - and you can see here that there's
21:13 - different sections
21:15 - this is the body typography uh links h1
21:19 - h2 so
21:20 - h1 would be a heading so like this is
21:23 - probably either an h1 or h2
21:25 - h1 is the biggest heading then h2 is the
21:27 - smaller heading so this is probably
21:30 - either an h2 or h3 so we can go through
21:32 - and change
21:34 - the typography and it will affect
21:36 - everything on the site so like body
21:38 - would be
21:40 - text of a paragraph like this so i'm
21:43 - going to go into
21:45 - the typography for the body
21:47 - and i'm going to change this to
21:54 - georgia so we can see it change this
21:56 - font here you can see that change the
21:58 - font on the button here and it will just
22:02 - change it all over our site here and
22:04 - then for the headings i'm going to do a
22:07 - little different i'm going to go into
22:09 - the typography here
22:13 - and i'm going to use
22:16 - trebuchet
22:17 - and so you can see the font changed and
22:19 - you can see we can also change the the
22:21 - weight transform style decoration line
22:24 - height some of this stuff i think is
22:26 - better to do
22:28 - for each individual
22:30 - heading like
22:31 - the the height the letter spacing you're
22:33 - probably not going to want to change the
22:34 - letter spacing for your entire site
22:36 - there could be some specific headings
22:38 - where you want to do that so we're going
22:39 - to leave that all as the default here
22:42 - and then i'm just going to go through
22:44 - and change all the headings because
22:46 - right now if we see we can see this does
22:48 - not look like the same font as
22:51 - this and then this is a different font
22:53 - so i'm going to go through and just
22:54 - change all these headings to use that
22:56 - same font
23:03 - and after you make any changes you have
23:05 - to make sure to click the update button
23:08 - so
23:09 - now it says your changes have been
23:11 - updated so this is going to make sure to
23:14 - save all the changes we just made
23:18 - so now let's go ahead and update this
23:21 - background image
23:22 - this section right here is often called
23:24 - a hero section it's like the first big
23:26 - section you see on a website and we want
23:28 - this background image to relate to
23:31 - unicycles in some way so what i'm going
23:33 - to do is click these six little dots at
23:35 - the this top this blue section edit
23:37 - section
23:38 - and then i am going to go to style and
23:42 - then we have the image here i'm gonna
23:44 - click choose image and there's a few
23:47 - different ways to do this so so if we go
23:48 - to update files i can select files on my
23:51 - computer we can also go to the media
23:53 - library and it's it
23:56 - the website started with all these
23:58 - images basically in here by default but
24:01 - we're going to be updating most of them
24:03 - but another thing you can do is go to
24:05 - free images so here this says powered by
24:08 - pixabay so that's a website that you can
24:11 - get free royalty free images and so i'm
24:14 - just going to search
24:15 - unicycle and then see what comes up here
24:19 - so let's see which picture would be a
24:21 - good background picture
24:25 - so i like this one it's going to have
24:26 - multiple unicycles and this looks like a
24:30 - pretty good size so i'm going to just
24:31 - click insert media
24:34 - and then let me just click choose images
24:36 - again
24:37 - let's see
24:38 - insert media
24:40 - okay i must have clicked the wrong thing
24:41 - or something okay here it goes and now
24:44 - we can see we have this unicycle picture
24:47 - in the background
24:49 - and then one thing i noticed is that now
24:51 - that we have this picture here the text
24:54 - is a little harder to read
24:57 - so i can go to where it says background
24:59 - overlay
25:00 - and i can change this opacity
25:03 - so see i can make this a little darker
25:06 - if i make this darker then you can see
25:09 - that the white text shows up a little
25:11 - better so i like that better and the
25:14 - overlay was already on there it started
25:15 - out at 0.2 and i've increased it to 0.61
25:19 - let's just do it at 0.6
25:21 - and yeah i like this
25:25 - so you can you can try different things
25:27 - you can change what the color is the
25:28 - base color here is black but we can make
25:30 - the base color something else it's just
25:32 - up to you on what what you want this to
25:34 - look like
25:35 - there's actually a lot of other changes
25:36 - you can make to make this look exactly
25:38 - how you want
25:40 - for example you may want to actually
25:42 - make this a gradient so we have the
25:45 - overlay it's just black but you could
25:46 - maybe go from black and maybe you want
25:48 - to be red at the bottom or maybe a blue
25:51 - so it's going to kind of
25:52 - go from black to blue
25:55 - and then you can
25:57 - change the location of where it where
26:00 - the second color starts so now the blue
26:02 - starts toward the bottom
26:04 - and then you can also change if it's
26:06 - going to be like a circle where it's
26:07 - black in the middle and then blue on the
26:10 - right but we are going to just go back
26:12 - to the classic just the single color
26:14 - black and if i go back up to the
26:16 - background here we can also change the
26:19 - position so right now it's center center
26:21 - but i could make it um like top right so
26:25 - it's it's going to kind of move the
26:26 - image around now we're not seeing too
26:29 - much movement with this image it
26:32 - basically just depends on what size of
26:34 - image you're starting with like what the
26:37 - the aspect ratio of the image you're
26:39 - starting with
26:40 - and then we're not going to do this but
26:42 - one one thing you can do is instead of
26:45 - having an image here you could put a
26:48 - video here so i could put a link to a
26:50 - video they'll just play in the
26:52 - background and we can still have the
26:54 - color overlay to make it so the text
26:57 - pops up
26:58 - pops up a lot and then you can also
27:01 - use a slideshow so you can make it
27:04 - switch between different images again
27:07 - let's just go back to classic we're just
27:08 - going to use this image we already found
27:10 - here so now let's make some additional
27:12 - changes here so
27:14 - we are i kind of like how it says we all
27:16 - love unicycles but we don't need this
27:19 - text here so i'm going to click here
27:25 - okay i'm just going to adjust this so it
27:26 - wasn't showing this will edit thing but
27:28 - now it is so i'm going to click here and
27:29 - then click this edit
27:31 - and this is allowing us to edit over
27:34 - here but if we don't want to actually
27:35 - edit the text or anything i can just
27:37 - right click on it and go to delete so
27:40 - now we just completely deleted
27:42 - that
27:43 - text
27:45 - and look where it says we all love
27:46 - unicycles
27:48 - we can make some adjustments in here
27:50 - like for instance this word unicycles is
27:53 - pretty big but
27:54 - you know i want to make even bigger so
27:56 - i'm going to go to style
27:57 - and then i am going to go to typography
28:02 - and then i can change the size here so
28:04 - it's even bigger here and then there's a
28:06 - bunch of other things i can do like for
28:08 - instance i could make it so it's bold
28:13 - and then i can change the letter spacing
28:14 - it's at negative three but let's say i
28:17 - want to kind of fill out more so i'm
28:19 - gonna just go to uh
28:21 - five
28:22 - so we all love unicycles and it's it's
28:25 - spreading out the letters a little more
28:28 - and we can also even change the color if
28:30 - we wanted now i kind of like the white
28:32 - so i'm going to go back to the white but
28:35 - one thing that i would like to do is add
28:37 - a text shadow now you're not going to
28:40 - see it too much because it's dark in the
28:41 - background
28:43 - but
28:44 - i just increase this here
28:48 - oh it changed the color
28:50 - so it's a little darker
28:53 - and now you can kind of see the the
28:56 - shadow
28:58 - there we go and decrease the blur
29:02 - okay now like i said it's going to show
29:04 - up more depending on what what
29:05 - background image you have but that's
29:07 - just one of the options you can do when
29:08 - you're changing the text
29:10 - now if you remember we deleted the text
29:13 - that was after this word but what if you
29:15 - decide that's a mistake you actually do
29:18 - want text after that word well i can go
29:21 - up here
29:22 - and
29:24 - here we go now i can drag in this
29:27 - intersection and i can just put where oh
29:30 - actually that's the wrong one the text
29:32 - editor and i can put it right under the
29:34 - word so now we have this this here now
29:37 - i'm going to have to
29:38 - do some style edits to make it look like
29:41 - what we wanted so i'm going to click
29:43 - this little edit button here
29:48 - and i'll go to style
29:49 - and then i can change the text color i'm
29:51 - going to go to white
29:53 - i can go the typography so i can make
29:56 - the the weight a little more i'm going
29:57 - to make this bold
29:59 - and
30:00 - i'm going to
30:01 - just
30:02 - so put down here so let me just delete
30:05 - this here and you can see this is just
30:07 - sample text we're not going to bother
30:10 - updating a lot of the sample text
30:12 - obviously in a real world situation
30:13 - you'll you'll update it to put the text
30:15 - that goes along with what you're trying
30:16 - to do here
30:18 - i'm going to center this
30:21 - i want this you the word unicycles to be
30:23 - a little closer to this so what we're
30:25 - going to do is actually click on the
30:26 - word unicycles i'm going to go to
30:28 - advanced and we're going to make changes
30:30 - to the margin and the padding so the
30:33 - padding is going to be the space kind of
30:35 - within the element and the margin is
30:38 - going to be the space outside the
30:40 - element so you can see the negative 50
30:42 - that's why this this top blue line
30:46 - is um kind of coming through that part
30:48 - of the i and l if we change this to
30:52 - 30
30:53 - you can see that it increases that
30:55 - margin up there i'm going to keep this
30:57 - at 50
30:59 - and
31:00 - so you can actually you can change
31:02 - everything
31:03 - all at once if you link them together so
31:05 - i can
31:07 - just add padding all at once
31:09 - wait it wasn't linked now it's linked
31:11 - together so now it's adding the padding
31:13 - all at once
31:15 - but we just want to
31:17 - actually
31:18 - change how close unicycles is to down
31:20 - here so on bottom i'm going to unlink it
31:23 - and i'm going to just
31:25 - actually the padding is not going to
31:27 - help the the margin is going to help
31:29 - again sometimes you just have to play
31:30 - around with it to see what's going to
31:32 - look best so i'm going to
31:34 - decrease that
31:36 - so now that this text here is closer to
31:39 - the word unicycle
31:41 - so now i'm going to show you let's say
31:42 - you actually did have a longer phrase
31:44 - here i'm just going to copy this and
31:46 - then put it in here and so let's say you
31:48 - had a phrase that went about this long
31:51 - now why is that white there
31:54 - let's try that again
31:57 - there we go so let's say you had a
31:58 - phrase that went this long but you want
32:00 - the text to not go so far out to the
32:04 - edge but let's see how we can change the
32:07 - width so this text is about as long as
32:09 - the word unicycles well we're going to
32:12 - click on this this dots here to change
32:15 - the settings for this whole section let
32:17 - me go to advanced
32:19 - and
32:20 - or actually it's layout we go to layout
32:22 - and then we'll go down to width so width
32:25 - here we have it as box but i'm going to
32:28 - actually do a custom width here
32:30 - and so it's going to this is like the
32:32 - full width but if i go down you can see
32:36 - it's changing the width here
32:38 - i don't want it so far down that the
32:40 - word unicycle starts going to the next
32:42 - line
32:42 - but
32:43 - that looks pretty good so now this text
32:46 - isn't going to go all the way off to the
32:47 - side
32:48 - so now let's make a change to this
32:51 - button it doesn't really get started
32:52 - that doesn't make sense
32:54 - when it relates to this unicycle store
32:57 - so i'm going to click this button here
32:59 - and i'm going to change the text
33:01 - so to change the text i just go to this
33:03 - thing that says text here instead of get
33:05 - started we're going to say c
33:08 - unicycles and this will take it to it
33:11 - will take people to a page showing all
33:13 - the different unicycles that are
33:14 - available at the store
33:16 - and we can
33:19 - change the style just like we would do
33:21 - any of these other things so you can add
33:23 - an icon here
33:25 - or you can change the alignment but and
33:28 - you can also just change the style so i
33:31 - am going to change this i don't instead
33:33 - of using that specific font i don't like
33:36 - that font for a button so instead of
33:38 - using the the default
33:41 - text i'm going to go down here
33:44 - and i'm going to use
33:46 - a google font or x i don't like that one
33:48 - let's try one more
33:53 - there we go and then i'm going to change
33:56 - the size here
33:57 - i'm going to change the weight i'm going
33:58 - to change it to 800
34:01 - and then i'm going to change the the
34:03 - background color so this yellow i'm not
34:05 - going to use yellow i'm going to
34:08 - go to this background type
34:12 - and right now
34:14 - i can select any color here
34:19 - i kind of like this orange color now if
34:22 - we want to make sure to use the same
34:23 - color elsewhere in our website i can
34:26 - click this plus button to create a new
34:28 - global color
34:30 - and
34:31 - i will call this unit orange
34:37 - and create so now we can easily select
34:39 - that same color for other sections of
34:41 - the website now that we have this color
34:43 - i'm going to go back to this
34:46 - text color and then i'm going to cr make
34:49 - it white
34:52 - okay that looks good
34:55 - and
34:56 - you may have noticed if i go back to the
34:58 - um the content tab we can change where
35:01 - the the link's going to go so i can type
35:04 - in the a page on us a page on our
35:07 - website like maybe it'll be about.html
35:11 - and uh right now we'll later we'll have
35:13 - to verify that we have the page called
35:15 - about.html
35:17 - so now let's see how to modify more
35:20 - sections so we i don't think we're going
35:22 - to need every
35:23 - section in on this page like this quote
35:26 - here i don't think we'll need this so
35:28 - i'm going to just x that out and close
35:30 - that and this we're going to modify it
35:34 - so instead of our services we'll do our
35:36 - unicycles
35:40 - and then i'm going to update these
35:42 - pictures so i'm just going to click on
35:44 - the picture
35:45 - and then i'll click choose image
35:47 - and
35:48 - previously when you weren't watching i
35:50 - uploaded some pictures of different
35:51 - unicycles i just went to upload files
35:53 - select files and select them selected
35:55 - them on my computer so we're going to
35:58 - insert some of these unicycles
36:00 - so just go here
36:02 - choose image
36:08 - and then choose another image
36:12 - and then you can obviously go through
36:14 - and
36:15 - change the text here
36:17 - so
36:18 - i'll put
36:20 - a
36:21 - fat tire
36:24 - long rides
36:29 - tall
36:30 - unicycle
36:32 - and then we can also go through and make
36:34 - changes to this so i'm gonna go to this
36:37 - fat tire section i'm going to click this
36:39 - edit
36:40 - button here whoops
36:42 - i can always just do command or ctrl z
36:45 - to undo
36:46 - so i'm i have this i have the
36:49 - title and description so here's the
36:51 - title here's the description
36:53 - and i'm going to change the style i'm
36:56 - going to scroll down to content so in
36:58 - the content
37:00 - i can
37:01 - change so we have the title here and
37:03 - then the description here
37:05 - so i can just change the title i'm going
37:07 - to change the color of the title and i'm
37:10 - going to
37:11 - actually go to the the global i'm going
37:13 - to click here where we can choose the
37:15 - color that we create if i scroll down
37:18 - uni orange
37:20 - and then the typography i'm going to
37:22 - change a little bit i'm going to change
37:25 - the weight to 900
37:28 - and then style i'll make this italic
37:32 - and then i'll change the alignment to
37:34 - center so this whole thing is going to
37:35 - be centered now what i can do is right
37:37 - click and i'm going to copy and now i
37:40 - can paste the style
37:43 - see i can paste the style here so now we
37:45 - have everything centered it has the
37:47 - different
37:48 - color for the title and that's looking
37:52 - pretty good
37:53 - so
37:54 - we have in about us in a question so we
37:57 - don't need this questions page here
38:00 - but let's say we want to add a new
38:02 - section so we already saw how you could
38:04 - click here and and
38:06 - add these different columns and then
38:08 - bring in over these other widgets but
38:10 - there's another way if i click this s
38:12 - here
38:13 - so this should look familiar we were
38:15 - able to choose different templates and
38:16 - we chose this one but there's this other
38:18 - tab here blocks
38:20 - so if i look through here i can look at
38:24 - something that looks similar to what i
38:26 - want to
38:27 - put in
38:29 - and i kind of like this the frequently
38:31 - asked questions
38:32 - so you may not want to add a frequently
38:34 - asked questions but if you if it looks
38:36 - similar to what you want to add that's a
38:38 - good thing to add you can see there's
38:39 - actually some different different ways
38:41 - it could look so i'm going to choose
38:44 - this one here and import block
38:47 - okay and then we can go through here and
38:50 - so this is kind of cool how you can
38:52 - minus and plus it to make the answer go
38:55 - go up and down it's called an accordion
38:57 - and you can see according items so
39:01 - if i click in here i can actually change
39:04 - the text of the title and the
39:06 - description so i can say
39:09 - what kind of
39:14 - unicycles
39:15 - do you have
39:18 - and i can
39:19 - update this we have all types
39:25 - and then
39:26 - on the page people can kind of go minus
39:28 - or plus
39:30 - and then for now i'm going to update
39:31 - this
39:32 - now i'm going to after it finishes
39:35 - update dating
39:38 - i'm going to click this little side
39:40 - arrow so this is going to close this
39:41 - close the side menu and then we can see
39:44 - more of what it's going to look like so
39:46 - with that closed this is more like what
39:48 - it's going to look like i still have the
39:50 - responsive screen up here so i can close
39:53 - that here
39:54 - but you can see it has all these changes
39:59 - and so it's starting to look more
40:00 - customized
40:03 - now i'm going to talk a little bit more
40:04 - about what you can do when you're adding
40:06 - custom sections now i already showed you
40:08 - how to add a section by clicking the
40:09 - plus arrow and by clicking this now i'm
40:12 - going to show you a few extra features
40:15 - that you can do like i'm
40:18 - so i'm just going to add a section just
40:20 - like this and it's going to have these
40:22 - two sections so i'm going to just add
40:26 - something to the section so for instance
40:29 - i'll add a button to this one
40:31 - and then to this one we will add
40:35 - a heading so when you're trying to get
40:38 - everything to look exactly like you want
40:41 - one thing that you may want to do is to
40:42 - add a background image so if i click
40:44 - this and then if i go to style
40:49 - actually advanced go to advanced and
40:51 - then i can go down to background here
40:53 - and i am going to add
40:57 - an image
40:58 - so just click this
41:00 - and then we'll just click we'll just
41:02 - choose one of these images that were
41:03 - that were already uploaded
41:06 - and then when we see the image it just
41:08 - looks like a solid color that's because
41:10 - we're just seeing the top of the image
41:12 - so we're going to want to position it so
41:15 - i can use this positioning i can even go
41:17 - to a custom position and i can change
41:21 - this
41:22 - and let me change the y position so we
41:25 - can see so now we can see actually some
41:28 - some trees in there and then we also
41:32 - to make this bigger to make where the
41:33 - image is we can add some padding so let
41:36 - me
41:37 - click here again and then we're going to
41:39 - go up to layout
41:41 - and in the in the
41:44 - we're going to unlink here and then i'm
41:46 - going to add some more padding on top
41:48 - here
41:50 - and then i'm going to add some more
41:52 - padding on bottom i'm actually going to
41:53 - use 75
41:56 - up top and 75 at bottom
42:01 - and then i'm going to add some padding
42:02 - on the left let's do 15.
42:06 - so you can mess with the padding to kind
42:08 - of choose how big a section is going to
42:10 - be and where things are going to be like
42:13 - let's say we want this button to be at
42:15 - the bottom well we can just change this
42:18 - padding to 25 and then this padding to
42:22 - 125
42:23 - and then it's the same size here but the
42:26 - button is now down here
42:29 - and then let's go over here
42:31 - if i go into this section with this
42:33 - heading here if i want to
42:36 - edit this section i can click this
42:38 - button here
42:40 - and then i'm also going to change the
42:42 - background
42:44 - type this time we'll do a gradient so
42:47 - i'll go from blue or i guess yeah blue
42:52 - to red there you're probably never going
42:54 - to want to do a gradient like that
42:57 - but i'm just kind of showing you some
42:58 - examples of what you can do
43:02 - if i go to layout here i can change the
43:05 - vertical and horizontal alignment so the
43:08 - vertical alignment is default but i'm
43:10 - going to put it at bottom so now what
43:11 - you can see is bring the text to the
43:14 - very bottom it's just so here we kind of
43:16 - use the padding to change where the
43:18 - button was but you can also use the
43:20 - vertical alignment and sometimes that
43:23 - can even be a better way of doing it
43:26 - now whether you want to do it with the
43:28 - padding or you want to do the vertical
43:30 - alignment that can depend on
43:33 - what you're going for so it's going to
43:36 - look very different in when we go to the
43:38 - the mobile responsive mode so if i click
43:40 - responsive mode up here and go to mobile
43:42 - i'm going to scroll down and we can see
43:45 - here because of the padding it's going
43:47 - to always be kind of the same height
43:49 - here
43:50 - but this section is not going to be the
43:53 - same height because remember before it
43:55 - was side by side what we had this box on
43:58 - the left and this box on the right and
44:00 - so this box would just kind of fill the
44:02 - space of this if we wanted this box to
44:05 - be the same height we would just add
44:07 - additional padding or margin on the top
44:10 - okay i'll go out of this
44:12 - and i'm actually just going to delete
44:14 - this whole section i just wanted to
44:16 - teach you more about
44:17 - the background images the padding and
44:19 - margin and different things you can do
44:21 - in that regard so i'm going to just x
44:23 - out of this
44:25 - now we'll talk a little bit more about
44:26 - adding videos i briefly mentioned it
44:28 - before but let's go through and this
44:31 - image we're going to convert into a
44:33 - video so really what i'm going to do
44:35 - first is just delete the image
44:38 - so i'm going to bring in this video here
44:41 - and i already talked about the different
44:42 - ways you can have a source for the video
44:44 - but
44:45 - youtube is generally the easiest i'm
44:47 - just going to paste in a video i found
44:50 - this unicycling video that we're going
44:51 - to use but one thing it starts with
44:54 - these titles here that i don't want to
44:56 - have so i'm going to
44:58 - make the start time be seven seconds so
45:01 - i'll just put in seven seconds for the
45:04 - start time
45:05 - and then it will start at that exact
45:07 - time
45:08 - and
45:09 - there's all these different things for
45:11 - the options you can do autoplay i'm
45:13 - going to make it so it mutes i'm going
45:16 - to make it yeah i'll make it so it loops
45:18 - and then i am gonna make it so it auto
45:21 - plays now you're generally
45:24 - probably don't want your video to auto
45:26 - play but if you wanna if you're putting
45:28 - as a background video there may be a
45:31 - time where you would want it to auto
45:32 - play but generally people don't like it
45:34 - when videos are audio playing so you
45:36 - know we'll just turn it off for now
45:38 - so now when people get to this page um
45:41 - we'll put that down they can
45:43 - start the video and it automatically
45:44 - starts after the titles and then they
45:47 - can watch all these unicycle tricks
45:52 - so let's just update this
45:55 - so it kind of relates to the video
46:00 - [Music]
46:05 - we offer courses
46:09 - to improve
46:10 - your eunice unicycle
46:13 - skills
46:16 - and then find out more
46:18 - and you can we can always link to where
46:21 - the the where the person can find out
46:22 - more right here
46:25 - and this about us i don't think we even
46:27 - need that so i'm going to delete that
46:30 - now i notice that this section this
46:32 - these sections all kind of blend
46:33 - together so let's add a new background
46:36 - to this and i'll show you some different
46:38 - things you can do when you're adding
46:39 - backgrounds so click these dots and i'm
46:42 - going to go to
46:44 - styles
46:45 - and
46:46 - background so this time i'm going to do
46:49 - a gradient
46:52 - the first color i'm actually going to
46:55 - choose our uni orange
46:57 - and then the second color i'm going to
47:00 - go for
47:01 - white
47:02 - and then with this angle we can actually
47:05 - change the angle of where how the
47:07 - gradients going and see and right now
47:11 - it's kind of a gradient but there's
47:13 - we can actually change the amount of
47:16 - gradient by by messing with the location
47:18 - so so the location will choose where the
47:22 - gradient starts you can kind of see how
47:23 - it's as i move it where the orange kind
47:26 - of goes back and forth but i can also
47:29 - move this white back and forth
47:32 - so the closer we get this together
47:34 - you know the less of a gradient and so
47:37 - we can make just a solid line like that
47:39 - i can change the angle like that
47:43 - and that i can
47:44 - make it go this way
47:46 - and now we're going to do
47:48 - 5757
47:50 - so
47:51 - now we still want to make this separate
47:53 - so i'm actually going to change this
47:55 - white
47:56 - to a
48:00 - slight light blue now this probably
48:02 - isn't the best design choice but i'm
48:05 - just kind of just showing you what's
48:06 - possible
48:08 - and i want to show you another cool
48:09 - thing i'm going to
48:11 - go out of background and go into
48:12 - background overlay
48:14 - so i'm going to go to choose image and
48:17 - i'm going to upload a file
48:21 - and then i'm going to
48:23 - insert the image
48:24 - and this is not exactly what we want you
48:27 - can see it's like repeating this
48:29 - unicycle i i got a picture with a
48:31 - transparent background so i'm going to
48:35 - so i'm going to change the size
48:41 - so the size is it's not going to go
48:43 - bigger than the section and repeat we're
48:45 - going to do no repeat
48:47 - and then i'm going to change the
48:49 - position
48:50 - i'm going to
48:51 - position it in the on the right side so
48:55 - you can see it's kind of behind this
48:57 - section here
49:00 - and then just adjust the video size here
49:04 - and now i'm going for attachment i'm
49:06 - going to go fixed so if it's fixed
49:09 - then when we scroll you can see
49:13 - the unicycle kind of behind the image
49:15 - that actually changed the size so i'm
49:18 - going to change the size
49:20 - and i'm going to do
49:22 - custom
49:23 - let's see what size we want
49:26 - okay that looks pretty good
49:28 - and now you can see when you scroll down
49:31 - you can see this unicycle in the
49:33 - background over on the side
49:36 - over on the side
49:37 - so that looks pretty cool
49:43 - i'm just going to do one quick thing i'm
49:44 - going to custom i'm going to put this
49:47 - into a custom position
49:49 - so
49:50 - it's not quite all the way to the edge
49:52 - so it's like right in the middle of this
49:53 - video
49:54 - and now let's try it
49:58 - okay
50:01 - um
50:02 - now let's just move it down a little bit
50:06 - okay so now when you scroll down you can
50:08 - see the that unicycle moving in the
50:10 - background well we probably put in
50:12 - enough time on this so let's just update
50:15 - this and we're just going to
50:18 - check what our page looks like so far
50:20 - now we see when i do this and the
50:22 - unicycle kind of changes position we can
50:25 - actually fix that by
50:27 - the way
50:29 - changing the x position so it's a
50:31 - percentage so let's do
50:34 - 60 percent for the x percent or maybe
50:39 - 80
50:40 - so now with the x position being a
50:43 - percentage like that
50:45 - if we go
50:46 - if we change the size of how wide the
50:49 - page is it's still going to be the same
50:51 - percentage into the page
50:56 - so another thing you may want to add in
50:58 - this section that we haven't covered yet
51:00 - is social icons so i'm just going to add
51:02 - one more section and show how you can
51:05 - add some social icons to share your
51:08 - twitter instagram youtube or any other
51:10 - site like that so i'm going to create a
51:13 - section here with two columns
51:16 - and in this column i'm just going to
51:18 - search for a widget i'm going to type in
51:20 - social i can bring that right into here
51:24 - now it defaults for facebook twitter and
51:27 - youtube but i can also add an item so
51:30 - right now it defaults to wordpress but i
51:32 - can just go into the icon library here
51:36 - and i can choose any of the other ones
51:38 - it's deep it's showing all these
51:40 - different
51:41 - links i could add there
51:43 - so i'm going to find instagram
51:46 - so if i just scroll up here you can see
51:48 - there are quite a few things we can
51:50 - choose from so do instagram here and
51:53 - insert so now it's instagram it's the
51:56 - instagram logo here and then you can add
51:59 - a link so uh for instance for youtube
52:01 - i'm just going to add a youtube link
52:05 - and we can use the official color of
52:08 - youtube which is red or we can do a
52:10 - custom color if we want to do a
52:12 - different color so well we have all you
52:15 - can add but just click here you can add
52:17 - a link for each social item
52:20 - and then you can even change the shape
52:22 - like right now it's rounded but we can
52:23 - change them to circles or square
52:26 - how many columns you want the alignment
52:28 - centered and then here i'm going to add
52:31 - a heading
52:32 - and i'm going to
52:34 - put
52:35 - follow us on social media
52:41 - so we have the social media and then
52:43 - here and then if i click here i can
52:46 - change the background so this section
52:49 - maybe i want a background overlay and
52:52 - i'm going to change the color
52:55 - to our uni orange color and then i'll
52:58 - update that
53:01 - so this is all we're going to do for our
53:03 - home page but let's just make sure
53:06 - everything's going to look good on a
53:08 - mobile device so i'm going to go to the
53:10 - responsive mode and go to mobile and so
53:14 - now we're just going to start the top
53:16 - and we're just going to scroll down
53:19 - okay if we go down we can see this
53:21 - unicycle thing this unicycle in the
53:24 - background it's in the corner but
53:26 - let's make it so just in mobile mode
53:29 - it's going to appear in a different spot
53:31 - so
53:33 - i'm going to
53:34 - click
53:36 - here to be editing this section and
53:38 - remember that was in background overlay
53:41 - and now we have it's showing that it's
53:43 - in mobile mode right here so any changes
53:46 - i make here it's only going to impact
53:49 - the mobile section
53:51 - so i'm going to
53:54 - make
53:55 - this kind of right in the middle
53:59 - and i am on the percentage here
54:02 - so that's good so 50
54:05 - and then i am going to make this
54:08 - fixed and says attachment fix works only
54:10 - on desktop
54:12 - so i think that's
54:13 - as good as we're gonna get on this let's
54:15 - just move this up a little bit
54:17 - and
54:20 - i'm gonna change the opacity a little
54:22 - more in mobile so you can see a little
54:25 - better
54:26 - okay if we keep scrolling down here we
54:29 - can see
54:30 - this looks pretty good but how about
54:32 - this let's make this heading let's make
54:34 - it center only on mobile so i am
54:37 - clicking the edit button here and we can
54:39 - see it's showing it's only on mobile i'm
54:41 - going to click center
54:42 - so
54:43 - in this way we can go and make changes
54:46 - that only impact
54:48 - mobile so like for instance we made the
54:50 - center on mobile but if i go back to
54:52 - desktop it's going to be left aligned
54:55 - so you can make sure
54:57 - things look good on mobile and specify
55:00 - specific settings that only apply to
55:02 - mobile or only apply to desktop
55:05 - another common thing that you're going
55:06 - to want to change on mobile is just the
55:08 - the text size like the this actually
55:10 - looks pretty good but sometimes you're
55:12 - going to say oh just on mobile we want
55:15 - this to be a smaller text size so it's
55:18 - pretty straightforward if you're going
55:19 - to do that you just go to typography and
55:21 - we can see it's in mobile mode and then
55:24 - i'm just going to make this
55:26 - a smaller size when people are on mobile
55:30 - and then i'll just click update to save
55:32 - all that
55:33 - so now we got our homepage done we're
55:35 - ready to go and modify the next section
55:38 - of our websites so to do that i'm going
55:41 - to click on preview changes and once
55:43 - we're on preview changes we can now see
55:45 - the different sections here well first
55:47 - of all we can actually scroll down and
55:48 - see what this looks like
55:50 - and then we can go to the next section
55:52 - which is the about page so on the about
55:55 - us page i can now go to edit with
55:58 - elementor
56:00 - and you can see what we when you're
56:02 - editing with elementor we can't see the
56:04 - the heading up here and so later we're
56:07 - going to talk about how to modify that
56:10 - in this about page
56:11 - i'm actually going to make these a
56:13 - capital letters about us
56:15 - and you don't even have to make this an
56:17 - about us page you can make it something
56:20 - else you can use the same
56:22 - page in this template and modify it so
56:24 - it's not an about us page but i'm going
56:26 - to change this background picture here
56:29 - so i'm going to go to style
56:32 - choose image and i'm going to do another
56:34 - search
56:36 - [Music]
56:38 - and this time i'm just going to use this
56:40 - one here
56:41 - and i'm just going to have to
56:43 - okay
56:44 - something to oh let's see if i click the
56:46 - top button
56:50 - okay that looks cool it actually lined
56:52 - up pretty well if it didn't i can always
56:56 - custom
56:57 - the size and move this around here
57:00 - but i'm going to go back to what it was
57:02 - which was bottom center
57:05 - and that looks pretty good
57:08 - and then i'm going to
57:11 - scroll down and some of these things
57:14 - what we're not going to have for our
57:15 - about us page
57:17 - we will have this text box but i'm going
57:19 - to delete this image
57:22 - and instead of having this our mission
57:24 - our values and this quote i'm going to
57:27 - add a section with all of our team
57:28 - members so i'm going to click this and
57:31 - then we'll go to blocks like before if
57:33 - we scroll down we can see all these
57:35 - different possibilities i'm just going
57:37 - to go with this one
57:39 - so ins import block
57:43 - and that now we can go through and make
57:45 - updates so i can say
57:47 - our team
57:49 - and then i can even change the color of
57:51 - this if i want or change the font i'm
57:54 - going to go into the style and put the
57:57 - color well actually click the global
57:59 - colors
58:00 - and
58:01 - i'm going to go to uni orange and we'll
58:04 - keep this the same but now we can go
58:06 - through and change the images so instead
58:10 - of those images
58:13 - i'm going to just choose some of these
58:15 - other images that were already on here
58:17 - so i got that one
58:21 - and now we'll have all color images
58:35 - and you can see i made a mistake there
58:37 - obviously so this is a good time to show
58:39 - you about this history button so i can
58:41 - go to history and then i can um go back
58:45 - to anything so i'm going to just go back
58:46 - to here
58:48 - and so we went back a few steps in the
58:50 - history now i'm going to
58:53 - change this image to this one
58:56 - and then the final image
58:58 - and now you know there's already a
59:00 - section that had all these different
59:02 - images but i'm just showing you how you
59:04 - if you want to add your own section
59:06 - and i'm going to change some of the
59:09 - stuff in here so i'm going to change the
59:11 - style and i'm going to
59:16 - change the title and we're going to use
59:18 - uni orange
59:19 - and what i'm going to do is just
59:21 - copy this section now we can just paste
59:24 - the style
59:25 - paste the style and paste the style
59:29 - and now i'm just going to go into
59:31 - responsive mode
59:32 - just to make sure everything looks good
59:34 - when we're responsive
59:39 - this does look pretty good i'm going to
59:41 - make a change though because
59:43 - i actually don't want this
59:46 - there to be so much space on the top and
59:48 - bottom of this text
59:50 - so i'm going to click here and then we
59:52 - have the minimum height right now the
59:53 - minimum height is 420 but if i
59:56 - change this
59:58 - now there's going to be less of a space
60:02 - in between the top and bottom like
60:03 - around this text and then i can actually
60:05 - go through and update this image
60:08 - and i'm going to do custom
60:11 - and i'm going to just
60:13 - whoop not that position i'm going to
60:15 - change this
60:18 - there we go
60:21 - and now this girl is still lined up
60:23 - correctly
60:24 - and then i'm just going to test again on
60:26 - responsive mode
60:31 - this is good the about it's still pretty
60:33 - big on responsive mode i think how i
60:36 - when i changed it it only
60:39 - it it didn't only it just changed
60:42 - on desktop mode so i can change on
60:44 - mobile also here
60:46 - and then i'm going to
60:48 - update the image as well on mobile mode
60:58 - okay looks good now i can click update
61:04 - and then i will go to
61:06 - preview changes
61:11 - now this is why it's important to
61:13 - preview changes you can see now this
61:15 - isn't lined up exactly how i wanted it
61:18 - so let me go back to edit with elementor
61:23 - and i think it's because when this goes
61:25 - back and forth
61:30 - you can see the where the image is
61:32 - placed is different well we can fix that
61:35 - so i'm going to go
61:37 - to style
61:39 - image
61:40 - and then instead of using the pixels i'm
61:43 - actually going to change it to
61:46 - the percentage
61:48 - so if i change it to percentage
61:52 - okay this is more of what i want so
61:54 - it does kind of
61:56 - cut off the girl a little bit the head
61:58 - but really we're focused on the unicycle
62:01 - so that's looking good if i go to
62:03 - responsive mode
62:08 - well that doesn't really make difference
62:09 - okay so we'll update and then preview
62:11 - changes
62:12 - okay
62:13 - now i'm going to go to
62:15 - services
62:18 - now we can go now we can on the services
62:20 - page we can go through and update and
62:22 - customize it but i'm going to use this
62:24 - as an exa
62:25 - as an opportunity to show how to remove
62:28 - a section so later i'm going to remove
62:31 - this whole services section from the
62:33 - website so we're just gonna have the
62:34 - home about and contact so let me go to
62:38 - the contact page and now i'm gonna make
62:41 - some updates on this contact page
62:44 - so i'm gonna go to edit with elementor
62:48 - okay we can see in the contact page
62:50 - already there's information about where
62:53 - the contact information like the email
62:55 - phone number location and then there's
62:57 - this form so let's see how we're going
63:00 - to customize this first let's click on
63:03 - this text and we're going to capitalize
63:06 - it
63:06 - just use title case so just like before
63:09 - i'm going to change the background image
63:10 - so i'll have to click this
63:12 - up here to change the background of this
63:14 - section here and i will go to the style
63:17 - and then i'm going to choose the image
63:19 - and i'm going to upload a file
63:21 - and then i'm just going to insert the
63:23 - media
63:24 - and i'm going to change the background
63:26 - overlay just like before so we can see
63:28 - the contact us a little better and i'm
63:30 - going to make it so
63:32 - there's less space on the top and bottom
63:34 - so i'm going to go to layout and change
63:36 - this height here
63:38 - and i'm going to adjust this position
63:41 - i'm going to custom here
63:43 - and let's see how we want to do this
63:45 - actually we want this to be zero
63:49 - and then the y position i'm going to
63:51 - change the percentage
63:55 - okay then we can kind of see the
63:57 - unicycle there
63:58 - okay now i'll just
64:00 - change this i'm going to change the
64:02 - color of this text
64:04 - and we'll use the color we've been using
64:06 - a lot i'll go to style
64:08 - text
64:10 - color and x whoops
64:16 - i'm going to use the uni orange
64:19 - and i'm going to
64:21 - copy this and then i'm going to paste
64:24 - the style
64:25 - and then you can go through and update
64:26 - the email address and the phone number
64:29 - i'm just going to leave this as default
64:30 - for now but
64:32 - for the email um you can change you can
64:35 - change if like if you want to put a dash
64:37 - here or if you want to
64:39 - look different here and then you can
64:41 - obviously change the style by updating
64:43 - the color here and then we have the
64:46 - social icons down here
64:48 - right now so you update them just like
64:51 - we saw before where i can put the
64:53 - twitter link here
64:55 - and if i want to change the colors back
64:57 - to like right now they're all gray but i
64:59 - can
65:00 - go to style and go to official color and
65:03 - these will be what we would expect here
65:06 - and what we really need to look at is
65:08 - the form this is where it's going to be
65:09 - a a little this is going to be something
65:12 - new so to make it so this send message
65:15 - will actually send an email we're going
65:18 - to have to update this form so first let
65:21 - me apply this
65:25 - and update i think i just actually
65:27 - needed to update so to
65:30 - get this form all working correctly we
65:32 - have to do that within the wordpress
65:34 - dashboard instead of the elementor
65:36 - dashboard so
65:38 - let me go to exit to dashboard
65:43 - and i can just close that out and click
65:45 - here to go to the main dashboard and
65:48 - then i'm going to go to wp forms here
65:51 - so now we can see the forms and we just
65:54 - have one form the contact form i'm going
65:56 - to edit
65:59 - and this is the form the styling is a
66:01 - little different but this is basically
66:03 - the form that's appearing on on the
66:04 - website
66:06 - and we can add additional things so
66:08 - right now we're just asking for the name
66:10 - email address message but if we want we
66:13 - can add a new a new element so i'll do
66:16 - go to add fields and
66:18 - let's make a drop down
66:20 - and then we can change it
66:22 - a favorite
66:25 - type of unicycle and then you can
66:30 - make different choices tall
66:32 - [Music]
66:34 - road unicycle
66:36 - or
66:38 - off-road
66:39 - [Music]
66:41 - and then people have a drop down box
66:44 - and now i'm going to go over to the
66:47 - settings
66:50 - and then notifications
66:52 - so
66:53 - this is where we're going to update
66:55 - exactly what happens when someone
66:58 - clicks the submit button
67:00 - it's going to default be whatever email
67:03 - we put as the admin email but if if you
67:05 - want a different email that this email
67:08 - is sent to we can type it right here
67:11 - now this is the same email at
67:14 - freecodecamp.org
67:15 - [Music]
67:17 - is the one we were using but if you're
67:20 - going to update the email address here
67:22 - you'll you should also update the from
67:24 - email address and then if you want the
67:27 - subject of the email to be different you
67:29 - can change it here so this is the email
67:30 - that you'll be receiving when a user of
67:33 - the website sends submits the contact
67:36 - form and this information is coming
67:38 - directly from the contact form and then
67:42 - when we're done with this we just have
67:43 - to make sure to click save now it says
67:46 - after saving these settings be sure to
67:48 - test a form submission so you can see
67:50 - how it looks so you're definitely going
67:51 - to want to test this out just to make
67:54 - sure everything's working but it should
67:56 - all work it should all be set up to work
67:59 - correctly
68:00 - okay i'm going to go out of this and
68:02 - we're going to go back into our
68:05 - page here so if i just click here it's
68:08 - going to
68:09 - open this up and there's a few final
68:11 - things we want to change so we've
68:14 - already learned how to customize all
68:16 - these pages with elementor but we want
68:20 - to do a few more things we want to
68:22 - update the logo here we want to i'm
68:24 - going to teach you how to update this
68:26 - header up here including changing this
68:29 - number or possibly just removing the
68:31 - phone number and then we're going to
68:33 - talk about how to update this footer
68:36 - here so we're not going to do that from
68:38 - with elementor i'm going to go to the
68:40 - customize button right here
68:42 - and then i'm going to go to
68:44 - header builder
68:46 - and it says the header on this page is
68:47 - set from the transparent header please
68:49 - click the link below to customize the
68:50 - transparent header so do that customize
68:53 - transparent header
68:55 - and we're going to decide first we're
68:57 - going to decide when the header is going
68:59 - to be on and it's we can just on desktop
69:01 - desk on mobile or mobile and desktop
69:04 - and we want to use a different logo for
69:06 - the transparent parent header no we
69:08 - wouldn't always use the same logo and
69:10 - here is where we want to change the logo
69:12 - so i'm going to update upload a new logo
69:16 - and it's just this little unicycle image
69:20 - so this is now going to be the the logo
69:22 - it's going to appear right up top here
69:25 - and then we still are going to have to
69:27 - update the logo down here but we have
69:29 - the new logo in our header
69:31 - and
69:32 - there's plenty of websites out there
69:34 - that can help you make it to a logo for
69:36 - your website and there's also a bunch of
69:39 - tutorials on youtube on how to make a
69:41 - logo or you can get a designer that to
69:43 - help you make a logo for your website
69:45 - but it's usually pretty important but
69:47 - it's it's very helpful to have a logo
69:50 - that you can use on your website that
69:52 - people can start identifying your
69:54 - website with your logo and then we can
69:56 - go down here do we want a different logo
69:58 - for written devices no we're going to
69:59 - keep that off
70:01 - and then the logo width i think it looks
70:04 - pretty good but
70:05 - we can change the logo if we wanted to
70:07 - we'll let's just go back to the the
70:09 - default which is 60 here
70:11 - now i'm going to go back up and i do
70:13 - want to actually turn this on enable on
70:15 - complete website so the header will
70:18 - always show up
70:19 - and then you can choose if there's any
70:21 - specific places where you want to
70:24 - disable it so i'm just going to leave
70:26 - that all as default
70:28 - now let's go up here we're still
70:29 - customizing the transparent header and
70:32 - we're going to see what options we have
70:34 - on the design so we just changed the
70:37 - logo here but you can see that depending
70:40 - on what your background image is you may
70:43 - want some sort of color or something
70:45 - behind here i think it looks pretty good
70:48 - for this image but you may want a
70:50 - background overlay so if i click that
70:53 - see i can use some other color here i
70:56 - could even try to
70:59 - get like an
71:00 - orange color i can change the
71:02 - transparency
71:04 - and i can even
71:06 - choose one of these other colors here
71:08 - that we have down here
71:10 - and i can make it kind of transparent
71:12 - now i don't really think that looks
71:14 - better so i'm going to turn that off
71:16 - there but there's just one option
71:18 - depending on what background image you
71:20 - have so i'm just going to clear that
71:23 - and it seems like it's kind of frozen up
71:24 - here if any if that ever happens to you
71:26 - just try publishing it and then after
71:28 - you publish just refresh the page or
71:31 - sometimes it'll just
71:32 - does it automatically so now
71:34 - now it's not loading anymore but there's
71:36 - a bunch of things you can change here so
71:39 - we can do the the overlay we can also
71:42 - change the color some of these other
71:43 - things like i can change the menu color
71:46 - or basically the color of these these
71:48 - words here right now it's white but if
71:51 - we want to change it red in this case
71:53 - this is the color of our
71:56 - current page we're on so see when i put
71:59 - my mouse it says hover active so this is
72:02 - the active page or if i'm hovering over
72:05 - a page see i want to hover over it so
72:07 - that's i kind of like that but i'm going
72:09 - to make this an orange color here
72:13 - so now when i hover over it's going to
72:15 - turn orange or if we're on the page it's
72:18 - going to be orange and then there's just
72:19 - a bunch of other colors you can change
72:22 - depending on what you're trying to do
72:23 - here
72:24 - so that's how you're going to change the
72:26 - design and the logo but now let's see
72:29 - how we can remove some of these elements
72:31 - like i told you about how we're not
72:34 - we're going to remove the services page
72:35 - from our website so we want to remove
72:37 - that so this is not where you're going
72:39 - to remove this but it is where we're
72:40 - going to remove this phone number here
72:42 - see
72:43 - if you look at this
72:44 - line here we have the site logo the site
72:48 - title and logo we have the primary menu
72:50 - and we have a button well the button is
72:52 - this thing right here so i'm just going
72:53 - to click remove the button and then it's
72:56 - going to remove that
72:57 - okay now i'm going to try to change the
72:59 - logo for this footer down here
73:02 - so there's a few ways i can just start
73:04 - clicking i can click this edit button
73:06 - here or i can back up here
73:09 - and then i'm going to go to the footer
73:11 - builder
73:12 - and then i will go to the design
73:19 - and then i will
73:22 - go to this see this html one that's the
73:25 - logo here so if i click in here
73:28 - we can see it's just an image
73:30 - that's right in here so i'm going to
73:34 - delete this image
73:36 - and then i can either just leave it
73:39 - deleted or i can add the logo again so
73:42 - to add the logo again i'm going to do
73:46 - this and then add media just click there
73:49 - insert into post
73:51 - and then i'm going to actually make it a
73:53 - lot smaller
73:58 - and then we can see that little unicycle
74:00 - see once we change the size here it
74:02 - changes the size here you can see that
74:05 - that says copyright is the copyright
74:07 - right here this thing right here we have
74:09 - the footer i mean we have the footer
74:11 - menu which is this menu right here and
74:13 - then we have this logo here so i don't
74:16 - actually
74:17 - want this copy to say this i'm going to
74:20 - change it so i'm going to click here and
74:22 - it's going to say
74:25 - made
74:26 - by
74:27 - bow
74:28 - and it's kind of off to the side here so
74:30 - let's see if i how i can change the
74:32 - design a little bit
74:34 - so it's not so far to the side now it's
74:37 - already showing a margin of 40
74:40 - but i think i'm going to actually have
74:42 - to change
74:43 - this this layout here
74:49 - and i'm going to put some padding on the
74:51 - right
74:53 - okay sometimes you just have to go just
74:56 - try out different things to figure out
74:57 - where you have to add the padding
74:59 - i had already
75:01 - tried to add the padding in one other
75:03 - spot i tried to add the padding here but
75:05 - or the margin here but it didn't
75:06 - increase anything so i just added had to
75:08 - add the padding on this whole section
75:11 - here
75:13 - okay now i'm going to teach you how to
75:15 - remove the the item from the menu
75:18 - it's not on this page surprisingly
75:20 - because if i click to click edit here um
75:23 - oh i guess it does say configure menu
75:25 - from here
75:26 - but i don't think i'm going to be able
75:28 - to remove an element from that menu
75:31 - so no yeah so i'm not going to be able
75:32 - to remove anything from the menu here so
75:35 - to remove something from the menu i have
75:38 - to well first of all i'm going to
75:39 - publish what i have
75:42 - and then i'm going to go back to the
75:44 - main wordpress page the main wordpress
75:48 - dashboard
75:49 - now i'm going to go to appearance
75:51 - and well and then menus here
75:55 - okay so
75:57 - we have these this menu the main menu
76:01 - and you can see home about service
76:03 - contact well i want to remove services
76:05 - i'm going to click here and i can do the
76:07 - drop down here and then
76:09 - remove
76:10 - and i'll just save the menu
76:13 - okay let me go back to the page
76:18 - now we see it says home about contact if
76:21 - i scroll down to the bottom
76:23 - home about contact so we've successfully
76:27 - removed that page
76:29 - so let's say you want to add a whole new
76:31 - page to this menu so to remove a page
76:35 - you just saw how to do that but to add a
76:37 - page first you're going to click or
76:39 - hover over the new button and then go to
76:42 - page
76:44 - and so you can and then after you're
76:47 - adding a page i can just click edit with
76:49 - elementor
76:52 - and so now it's a page with nothing it
76:56 - has a header it has a footer but it
76:58 - doesn't have anything else i may want to
77:01 - go into here go into the blocks
77:04 - and
77:05 - i can actually sort by different thing
77:07 - i'm going to hero because usually you
77:08 - want some sort of big thing at the top
77:11 - and i'm going to put this and i'm going
77:12 - to import this block
77:15 - and then i could go through and edit the
77:17 - page just like what we've been learning
77:19 - i'm actually just going to put a solid
77:22 - color here as the background this is
77:25 - just a super quick example we're not
77:27 - going to use this in the page but i'm
77:29 - also going to change
77:31 - this
77:32 - to
77:33 - just a blue up here
77:37 - and then i just want to show you how you
77:39 - would add this new section to the page
77:43 - so it just loaded this image from just
77:46 - the the template here for the this top
77:49 - section here but if i click publish
77:51 - and let's say i want to add this to a

Cleaned transcript:

in this course you will learn how to create a custom website without any code using elementor and wordpress i'm beau with freecodecamp.org i've created a few popular wordpress courses and this one is specifically focused on elementor elementor is a free wordpress website builder and this course is all you need to learn how to build a bunch of different types of websites and you don't need any prior experience to follow along you will learn a drag and drop system that allows for easy and limitless customization so you can build the perfect website for your needs and the website will look great on both desktop and mobile so let's get started the first step is to get a domain name and hosting we'll be getting that at hostinger.com but you can still follow along if you use a different hosting provider hostinger provided a grant that made this course possible but i had already used hostinger personally in the past and had a good experience hostinger is optimized for wordpress sites and has a 99.9 uptime guarantee they also give you a free domain and free ssl so we can just go here get click get started and then you can decide whether you're going to create a brand new website or transfer an existing website well we're creating a brand new website and you can you don't have to go through all this but we are doing a wordpress here and i'm just going to go through here and it'll tell you what kind of package we want to do so we can just skip this for now because this is actually an upgrade but we don't want to upgrade so i'll just go to skip here and then it's going to recommend the premium shared hosting plan so you can actually go and just select your plan manually but this will help you figure out the exact plan you want you can see right here you can actually host a hundred different websites on this plan and you get a good amount of storage and you get unlimited bandwidth so that's pretty good you includes a free domain and then ssl will make it so you have a secure website so this is a good option so i'm just going to select that and then it's going to show where you can actually upgrade if you want or you you can choose a different amount of months and you can see depending on how many months you buy a time is is how much it's going to renew for so you can see this one renews at 699 799 899 or 11.99 a month so just pick whatever one you think is gonna work best for you if you're just testing it out you could just do a the one month plan or if you know you're going to have a website long term you can do one of these other plans and then um after you get all this set up you can go through just to create the account and you can select your payment and then you can submit it so i'm not actually going to type in everything but it's pretty straightforward if you're going to create your own account for the first time so after you get logged in and possibly as part of creating your account you're going to want to get your domain so if you're done creating your account and you haven't gotten a domain through that process yet we can just click on claim domain right in the main menu now here is you you're going to have to have a domain name that's never been used before it could take you a few tries to find one that's not already taken but i'm going to go with beau with the dashes that's my name bo but my name doesn't have dashes but o.net let's check availability and i already tested this so i knew it knew it would work and i will claim domain okay now we have to set up this domain registration details and we'll just finish filling this out okay the domain is registered okay now add the website to the hosting plan and i already had this hosting plan registered for this other website so select that one website connected successfully now i'll show you how to set up an email account on your domain through hostinger so i'm on the hostinger home tab after i'm logged in and i'm going to just click emails and now i'm going to the so i already set up this one before but now i'm going to set the email on the domain we just created so i'm just going to click there and then create email account and then i'm just going to type in it automatically filled in something but i can type in anything i want so i'm going to put bow and then i'm just going to type in a password here and then create okay so now people can email me at bo b dash e a dash u.net and then i can access the email by still being on this email tab here and going to webmail and then i'll just sign in here and there are no messages but i can always compose a new message here and then i'll receive messages if someone sends me a message and now let's go over how to set up ssl for the website so i'm going to go to the ssl tab on this hosting or dashboard and ssl is important it makes sure all data coming and going from your website is secure and nobody's going to be able to there there won't be any hackers or anybody that can see what's going on with the website if someone submits information it'll be secure nobody will be able to see what that information is so i'm just going to click the install ssl button and then i'm going to select the website and just click install ssl and the great thing is that it's it's free it's completely included within hosting or within the plan and now i should have ssl but i'm going to actually do this drop down menu to go to the bow.net to see the one that we just added and you can see it's installing it says it may take up to an hour but then after that we can go to the website instead of going to http colon slash bo.net it will be http s colon slash bo.net because it has the ssl it's the the s stands for secure i'll go back to the dashboard now i want to get wordpress installed on the website many different website hosting services allow you to easily install wordpress on the website so the exact method could be different if you're not using hostinger but it should be relatively similar so i'm just going to scroll down on this page here and i'm going to click wordpress and then i'm going to install wordpress and i'll fill this out to finish setting up so let's call it my website for now and anything here can be changed later and then i'll put in the password and then i'll just use these default settings here and click install we're on the hostinger dashboard but we want to go to the wordpress dashboard so we can start creating our wordpress website so i'll just click on edit website if you're using something besides beside wordpress there'll be something similar to get into the wordpress dashboard another way you can always access your wordpress dashboard if you look in the url bar here we have the url name and then it's slash wpadmin you can always go to slash wpadmin to get to your wordpress dashboard okay i've zoomed in a little bit on this and we're just going to look at some of the things on the menu over here these are all things that are important when creating a wordpress page we have our posts when we're going to create a new post but you're likely going to be creating a new page like the about us page contact page and stuff like that and we'll be going over that more later and you can also change your appearance and there's just a bunch of other sections here many of which will be going over in more detail later in this tutorial but first of all let's go over to users and you just want to make sure that you have a a password we just want to make sure that the password is the password we chose now depending on how you installed wordpress you may not have created a password and depending on what hosting provider you use and you just might want to make maybe verify that you're not going to have a default password so i'm just going to type in a password here and then i'm going to do update profile okay now we're going to go to the plugins tab before we deal with the plugins let's just get rid of some of these tabs i'm going to click x here we don't need this i guess they're not tabs they're just information boxes and to get rid of this one we're going to go through and actually delete some of the extra plugins here we don't a lot of these plugins we don't actually need so i've selected all the extra plugins and i don't need this one either and i'm going to go to oh first i'll do deactivate and then i'll just select them again and i'm going to go to delete and don't worry if you accidentally delete a plugin that you actually need because it's really easy to reinstall them so i'm going to go to delete okay and now we've deleted all the plugins we don't need and you can see we no longer have the extra information box up here those associated with a particular pro plugin so now i'm going to go to add new this is an elementor tutorial so we could just install directly like this by searching for elementor and then we could click install now but we're actually going to install it a little differently we're going to install something else that will in turn install elementor it will install some themes it will install some templates and so we'll get everything in one by installing one thing so instead i'm going to search for starter starter templates okay this is going to install elementor plus a few other things that are going to be helpful so i'm just going to click install now and activate so let me go here down here and click see library and we don't need to watch this video here i'm going to click on build your website now and then you can click which plate you can choose what page builder you're going to use so in this tutorial we're learning about elementor so i'll click elementor and then it's going to give you a list of templates you can use so you can see some of these are premium so you get to pay extra for but there is a bunch of really good free templates and i highly recommend starting your website by using a template and then you can customize the template to meet your specific needs so go through and look at these templates and try to see what template looks closest to the website that you want to make and then you can modify that template to meet your specific needs so i'm going to choose this one but keep in mind everything is super customizable so no matter what one you choose you're going to be able to add sections remove sections change colors change pictures to make it so it meets your needs so i'm going to click this one here and it's already showing how we can customize things by adding a logo and different things like that but we're going to do all of that later so i'm going to do skip and continue and it's going to show you can actually choose different colors and fonts but again we're just going to do all this later because we just want to get the template installed on our wordpress instance and then we'll do all the customization later so it says one last step and then we can choose some of these advanced options so we are going to install this theme to go along with it the astra theme and the customizer settings we're just going to keep all these checked except i don't want to share any data and then import content this is this will import dummy pages posts images and menus so we could uncheck it if you want to do everything from scratch but i like starting with things and it's easier to change things once you once you start with something so i'm going to click submit and build the res the website and you notice i didn't even have to put in any information about my name or my email address or anything like that okay the website is ready i'll go to view your website and this is the website so it basically just installed everything all the the sample images and stuff like that and you can see there's different sections the home about services and the great thing about this is we can edit everything this doesn't have to be a services page we can make this into anything it can be a product page it can be a more information page maybe it could show a list of different people that worked at our company so we're going to be able to update all this stuff to meet our specific needs and you can see right now these are all dummy links if i click start a project it doesn't do anything and we have a contact page here so let's see how we can start updating this website using elementor to be the exact website we need for our project and so we can't edit anything right now this is just the view mode but to edit it we can go to edit with elementor just click edit with elementor and it's going to load that and now we have the site right here but then we also have the elementor editing menu over here and this is what we're going to use to add sections modify sections and just make the website be exactly what we want to be using elementor so first of all we have the navigator here which will help us select different sections on our website so here's the first section right here and then here it's going to go to the second section and you can see whenever you select a section it's going to put a blue outline around it so you can see this blue here here this blue line around the outline and then you can see you can select the section with these buttons here this is how you would add a new section and i can just delete that with this x here or you can delete a section or if i click here this is how i would move the section around so this we can select down here the bottom section but we don't even need the navigator i'm going to close the navigator because you can select a selection just by clicking on it so when i move my mouse over a section you can see the blue outline goes around that section and i already showed you that if you click the plus button you can add a new section and then we can bring over widgets so i'm actually going to go over here and get to the elements tab here and these are all widgets i can bring in so i can bring in an image i'll drag this image in here and then it's going to this is like the default thing here but i can actually choose an image and there's already images here that came with the website i'll be showing you how to add more later but like for example i could add a picture of this man and then it will be right here now obviously that's not really what we want so i'll x this here but let me show you one thing another thing is that there are often different columns so when we first create a section there is just one big column but if i click the plus button i can choose the structure is it just me one big area are there going to be two columns three columns four columns and you can see what if i want a small section here and a big section over here you can change the size by dragging this around here and then you can add different things to different sections so if i click the plus button that's going to bring up these different widgets and like i already showed you had an image but maybe we want to add a heading here and then after the heading you may want to add something after the heading so if i go back to these widgets i may want to add a text so we have the heading and we have the text here and over here we may want to add a video and when you edit video you can link to a specific youtube video or you can choose a few different sources including selfhosted so there's just quite a few different things you can do by adding different sections and different widgets and soon i'll be going into more detail about more things you can do with these sections in these widgets and show you how and then i'll show you how to modify the current sections on the website so i'm going to delete this extra section now and i wanted to show you one other cool thing about starting with a template like this it's already set up to be responsive so if i click this here there's a button on here says responsive mode and then i can choose am i do i want to look at it like it's a desktop a tablet or a mobile device i'm going to click mobile device so you can see as i scroll down everything gets drunk into a uh one column that's going to look better on a mobile device i can go back to the desktop site and if i'm done testing out these different sizes i can just hit x here now we're going to actually start customizing this page to meet our needs first of all we can always preview changes so we haven't made any changes but you can always go back to the main page by going preview changes i'm going to go back to the home and i'm going to just click edit with elementor again and so now we're at the at the home page again and you can customize the website to be any type of page it can be a blog it can be a business page it can be an online store there's tons of possibilities an elementor can basically make any type of page you want to make it and just for fun we're going to customize this page so it's a store that sells unicycles like i said you can make yours anything you like so let's look at this text here so for one you can easily change any text you see on the screen so i can say unicycles we all love unicycles there we go and then let's say we don't we want a different font if you want a different font there's a few ways to go about it you can select the text you can go to style and then i can go to typography and i can go to here and i can change to a different font here so i could change change it to verdana or times new roman or i can basically i can choose any font here there's even these google fonts here you can actually load any fonts from google fonts but let's say we know that we want all our fonts to be the same you may not so this is the way where you would do it individually you could select every single text box and change that font but there's also a way to change all of the fonts at once so i'm going to go back to default here and now i'm going to go to content or i'm going to click this hamburger menu and go to site settings so then i'm going to go to typography and now we're going to change the typography for the entire site and you can see here that there's different sections this is the body typography uh links h1 h2 so h1 would be a heading so like this is probably either an h1 or h2 h1 is the biggest heading then h2 is the smaller heading so this is probably either an h2 or h3 so we can go through and change the typography and it will affect everything on the site so like body would be text of a paragraph like this so i'm going to go into the typography for the body and i'm going to change this to georgia so we can see it change this font here you can see that change the font on the button here and it will just change it all over our site here and then for the headings i'm going to do a little different i'm going to go into the typography here and i'm going to use trebuchet and so you can see the font changed and you can see we can also change the the weight transform style decoration line height some of this stuff i think is better to do for each individual heading like the the height the letter spacing you're probably not going to want to change the letter spacing for your entire site there could be some specific headings where you want to do that so we're going to leave that all as the default here and then i'm just going to go through and change all the headings because right now if we see we can see this does not look like the same font as this and then this is a different font so i'm going to go through and just change all these headings to use that same font and after you make any changes you have to make sure to click the update button so now it says your changes have been updated so this is going to make sure to save all the changes we just made so now let's go ahead and update this background image this section right here is often called a hero section it's like the first big section you see on a website and we want this background image to relate to unicycles in some way so what i'm going to do is click these six little dots at the this top this blue section edit section and then i am going to go to style and then we have the image here i'm gonna click choose image and there's a few different ways to do this so so if we go to update files i can select files on my computer we can also go to the media library and it's it the website started with all these images basically in here by default but we're going to be updating most of them but another thing you can do is go to free images so here this says powered by pixabay so that's a website that you can get free royalty free images and so i'm just going to search unicycle and then see what comes up here so let's see which picture would be a good background picture so i like this one it's going to have multiple unicycles and this looks like a pretty good size so i'm going to just click insert media and then let me just click choose images again let's see insert media okay i must have clicked the wrong thing or something okay here it goes and now we can see we have this unicycle picture in the background and then one thing i noticed is that now that we have this picture here the text is a little harder to read so i can go to where it says background overlay and i can change this opacity so see i can make this a little darker if i make this darker then you can see that the white text shows up a little better so i like that better and the overlay was already on there it started out at 0.2 and i've increased it to 0.61 let's just do it at 0.6 and yeah i like this so you can you can try different things you can change what the color is the base color here is black but we can make the base color something else it's just up to you on what what you want this to look like there's actually a lot of other changes you can make to make this look exactly how you want for example you may want to actually make this a gradient so we have the overlay it's just black but you could maybe go from black and maybe you want to be red at the bottom or maybe a blue so it's going to kind of go from black to blue and then you can change the location of where it where the second color starts so now the blue starts toward the bottom and then you can also change if it's going to be like a circle where it's black in the middle and then blue on the right but we are going to just go back to the classic just the single color black and if i go back up to the background here we can also change the position so right now it's center center but i could make it um like top right so it's it's going to kind of move the image around now we're not seeing too much movement with this image it basically just depends on what size of image you're starting with like what the the aspect ratio of the image you're starting with and then we're not going to do this but one one thing you can do is instead of having an image here you could put a video here so i could put a link to a video they'll just play in the background and we can still have the color overlay to make it so the text pops up pops up a lot and then you can also use a slideshow so you can make it switch between different images again let's just go back to classic we're just going to use this image we already found here so now let's make some additional changes here so we are i kind of like how it says we all love unicycles but we don't need this text here so i'm going to click here okay i'm just going to adjust this so it wasn't showing this will edit thing but now it is so i'm going to click here and then click this edit and this is allowing us to edit over here but if we don't want to actually edit the text or anything i can just right click on it and go to delete so now we just completely deleted that text and look where it says we all love unicycles we can make some adjustments in here like for instance this word unicycles is pretty big but you know i want to make even bigger so i'm going to go to style and then i am going to go to typography and then i can change the size here so it's even bigger here and then there's a bunch of other things i can do like for instance i could make it so it's bold and then i can change the letter spacing it's at negative three but let's say i want to kind of fill out more so i'm gonna just go to uh five so we all love unicycles and it's it's spreading out the letters a little more and we can also even change the color if we wanted now i kind of like the white so i'm going to go back to the white but one thing that i would like to do is add a text shadow now you're not going to see it too much because it's dark in the background but i just increase this here oh it changed the color so it's a little darker and now you can kind of see the the shadow there we go and decrease the blur okay now like i said it's going to show up more depending on what what background image you have but that's just one of the options you can do when you're changing the text now if you remember we deleted the text that was after this word but what if you decide that's a mistake you actually do want text after that word well i can go up here and here we go now i can drag in this intersection and i can just put where oh actually that's the wrong one the text editor and i can put it right under the word so now we have this this here now i'm going to have to do some style edits to make it look like what we wanted so i'm going to click this little edit button here and i'll go to style and then i can change the text color i'm going to go to white i can go the typography so i can make the the weight a little more i'm going to make this bold and i'm going to just so put down here so let me just delete this here and you can see this is just sample text we're not going to bother updating a lot of the sample text obviously in a real world situation you'll you'll update it to put the text that goes along with what you're trying to do here i'm going to center this i want this you the word unicycles to be a little closer to this so what we're going to do is actually click on the word unicycles i'm going to go to advanced and we're going to make changes to the margin and the padding so the padding is going to be the space kind of within the element and the margin is going to be the space outside the element so you can see the negative 50 that's why this this top blue line is um kind of coming through that part of the i and l if we change this to 30 you can see that it increases that margin up there i'm going to keep this at 50 and so you can actually you can change everything all at once if you link them together so i can just add padding all at once wait it wasn't linked now it's linked together so now it's adding the padding all at once but we just want to actually change how close unicycles is to down here so on bottom i'm going to unlink it and i'm going to just actually the padding is not going to help the the margin is going to help again sometimes you just have to play around with it to see what's going to look best so i'm going to decrease that so now that this text here is closer to the word unicycle so now i'm going to show you let's say you actually did have a longer phrase here i'm just going to copy this and then put it in here and so let's say you had a phrase that went about this long now why is that white there let's try that again there we go so let's say you had a phrase that went this long but you want the text to not go so far out to the edge but let's see how we can change the width so this text is about as long as the word unicycles well we're going to click on this this dots here to change the settings for this whole section let me go to advanced and or actually it's layout we go to layout and then we'll go down to width so width here we have it as box but i'm going to actually do a custom width here and so it's going to this is like the full width but if i go down you can see it's changing the width here i don't want it so far down that the word unicycle starts going to the next line but that looks pretty good so now this text isn't going to go all the way off to the side so now let's make a change to this button it doesn't really get started that doesn't make sense when it relates to this unicycle store so i'm going to click this button here and i'm going to change the text so to change the text i just go to this thing that says text here instead of get started we're going to say c unicycles and this will take it to it will take people to a page showing all the different unicycles that are available at the store and we can change the style just like we would do any of these other things so you can add an icon here or you can change the alignment but and you can also just change the style so i am going to change this i don't instead of using that specific font i don't like that font for a button so instead of using the the default text i'm going to go down here and i'm going to use a google font or x i don't like that one let's try one more there we go and then i'm going to change the size here i'm going to change the weight i'm going to change it to 800 and then i'm going to change the the background color so this yellow i'm not going to use yellow i'm going to go to this background type and right now i can select any color here i kind of like this orange color now if we want to make sure to use the same color elsewhere in our website i can click this plus button to create a new global color and i will call this unit orange and create so now we can easily select that same color for other sections of the website now that we have this color i'm going to go back to this text color and then i'm going to cr make it white okay that looks good and you may have noticed if i go back to the um the content tab we can change where the the link's going to go so i can type in the a page on us a page on our website like maybe it'll be about.html and uh right now we'll later we'll have to verify that we have the page called about.html so now let's see how to modify more sections so we i don't think we're going to need every section in on this page like this quote here i don't think we'll need this so i'm going to just x that out and close that and this we're going to modify it so instead of our services we'll do our unicycles and then i'm going to update these pictures so i'm just going to click on the picture and then i'll click choose image and previously when you weren't watching i uploaded some pictures of different unicycles i just went to upload files select files and select them selected them on my computer so we're going to insert some of these unicycles so just go here choose image and then choose another image and then you can obviously go through and change the text here so i'll put a fat tire long rides tall unicycle and then we can also go through and make changes to this so i'm gonna go to this fat tire section i'm going to click this edit button here whoops i can always just do command or ctrl z to undo so i'm i have this i have the title and description so here's the title here's the description and i'm going to change the style i'm going to scroll down to content so in the content i can change so we have the title here and then the description here so i can just change the title i'm going to change the color of the title and i'm going to actually go to the the global i'm going to click here where we can choose the color that we create if i scroll down uni orange and then the typography i'm going to change a little bit i'm going to change the weight to 900 and then style i'll make this italic and then i'll change the alignment to center so this whole thing is going to be centered now what i can do is right click and i'm going to copy and now i can paste the style see i can paste the style here so now we have everything centered it has the different color for the title and that's looking pretty good so we have in about us in a question so we don't need this questions page here but let's say we want to add a new section so we already saw how you could click here and and add these different columns and then bring in over these other widgets but there's another way if i click this s here so this should look familiar we were able to choose different templates and we chose this one but there's this other tab here blocks so if i look through here i can look at something that looks similar to what i want to put in and i kind of like this the frequently asked questions so you may not want to add a frequently asked questions but if you if it looks similar to what you want to add that's a good thing to add you can see there's actually some different different ways it could look so i'm going to choose this one here and import block okay and then we can go through here and so this is kind of cool how you can minus and plus it to make the answer go go up and down it's called an accordion and you can see according items so if i click in here i can actually change the text of the title and the description so i can say what kind of unicycles do you have and i can update this we have all types and then on the page people can kind of go minus or plus and then for now i'm going to update this now i'm going to after it finishes update dating i'm going to click this little side arrow so this is going to close this close the side menu and then we can see more of what it's going to look like so with that closed this is more like what it's going to look like i still have the responsive screen up here so i can close that here but you can see it has all these changes and so it's starting to look more customized now i'm going to talk a little bit more about what you can do when you're adding custom sections now i already showed you how to add a section by clicking the plus arrow and by clicking this now i'm going to show you a few extra features that you can do like i'm so i'm just going to add a section just like this and it's going to have these two sections so i'm going to just add something to the section so for instance i'll add a button to this one and then to this one we will add a heading so when you're trying to get everything to look exactly like you want one thing that you may want to do is to add a background image so if i click this and then if i go to style actually advanced go to advanced and then i can go down to background here and i am going to add an image so just click this and then we'll just click we'll just choose one of these images that were that were already uploaded and then when we see the image it just looks like a solid color that's because we're just seeing the top of the image so we're going to want to position it so i can use this positioning i can even go to a custom position and i can change this and let me change the y position so we can see so now we can see actually some some trees in there and then we also to make this bigger to make where the image is we can add some padding so let me click here again and then we're going to go up to layout and in the in the we're going to unlink here and then i'm going to add some more padding on top here and then i'm going to add some more padding on bottom i'm actually going to use 75 up top and 75 at bottom and then i'm going to add some padding on the left let's do 15. so you can mess with the padding to kind of choose how big a section is going to be and where things are going to be like let's say we want this button to be at the bottom well we can just change this padding to 25 and then this padding to 125 and then it's the same size here but the button is now down here and then let's go over here if i go into this section with this heading here if i want to edit this section i can click this button here and then i'm also going to change the background type this time we'll do a gradient so i'll go from blue or i guess yeah blue to red there you're probably never going to want to do a gradient like that but i'm just kind of showing you some examples of what you can do if i go to layout here i can change the vertical and horizontal alignment so the vertical alignment is default but i'm going to put it at bottom so now what you can see is bring the text to the very bottom it's just so here we kind of use the padding to change where the button was but you can also use the vertical alignment and sometimes that can even be a better way of doing it now whether you want to do it with the padding or you want to do the vertical alignment that can depend on what you're going for so it's going to look very different in when we go to the the mobile responsive mode so if i click responsive mode up here and go to mobile i'm going to scroll down and we can see here because of the padding it's going to always be kind of the same height here but this section is not going to be the same height because remember before it was side by side what we had this box on the left and this box on the right and so this box would just kind of fill the space of this if we wanted this box to be the same height we would just add additional padding or margin on the top okay i'll go out of this and i'm actually just going to delete this whole section i just wanted to teach you more about the background images the padding and margin and different things you can do in that regard so i'm going to just x out of this now we'll talk a little bit more about adding videos i briefly mentioned it before but let's go through and this image we're going to convert into a video so really what i'm going to do first is just delete the image so i'm going to bring in this video here and i already talked about the different ways you can have a source for the video but youtube is generally the easiest i'm just going to paste in a video i found this unicycling video that we're going to use but one thing it starts with these titles here that i don't want to have so i'm going to make the start time be seven seconds so i'll just put in seven seconds for the start time and then it will start at that exact time and there's all these different things for the options you can do autoplay i'm going to make it so it mutes i'm going to make it yeah i'll make it so it loops and then i am gonna make it so it auto plays now you're generally probably don't want your video to auto play but if you wanna if you're putting as a background video there may be a time where you would want it to auto play but generally people don't like it when videos are audio playing so you know we'll just turn it off for now so now when people get to this page um we'll put that down they can start the video and it automatically starts after the titles and then they can watch all these unicycle tricks so let's just update this so it kind of relates to the video we offer courses to improve your eunice unicycle skills and then find out more and you can we can always link to where the the where the person can find out more right here and this about us i don't think we even need that so i'm going to delete that now i notice that this section this these sections all kind of blend together so let's add a new background to this and i'll show you some different things you can do when you're adding backgrounds so click these dots and i'm going to go to styles and background so this time i'm going to do a gradient the first color i'm actually going to choose our uni orange and then the second color i'm going to go for white and then with this angle we can actually change the angle of where how the gradients going and see and right now it's kind of a gradient but there's we can actually change the amount of gradient by by messing with the location so so the location will choose where the gradient starts you can kind of see how it's as i move it where the orange kind of goes back and forth but i can also move this white back and forth so the closer we get this together you know the less of a gradient and so we can make just a solid line like that i can change the angle like that and that i can make it go this way and now we're going to do 5757 so now we still want to make this separate so i'm actually going to change this white to a slight light blue now this probably isn't the best design choice but i'm just kind of just showing you what's possible and i want to show you another cool thing i'm going to go out of background and go into background overlay so i'm going to go to choose image and i'm going to upload a file and then i'm going to insert the image and this is not exactly what we want you can see it's like repeating this unicycle i i got a picture with a transparent background so i'm going to so i'm going to change the size so the size is it's not going to go bigger than the section and repeat we're going to do no repeat and then i'm going to change the position i'm going to position it in the on the right side so you can see it's kind of behind this section here and then just adjust the video size here and now i'm going for attachment i'm going to go fixed so if it's fixed then when we scroll you can see the unicycle kind of behind the image that actually changed the size so i'm going to change the size and i'm going to do custom let's see what size we want okay that looks pretty good and now you can see when you scroll down you can see this unicycle in the background over on the side over on the side so that looks pretty cool i'm just going to do one quick thing i'm going to custom i'm going to put this into a custom position so it's not quite all the way to the edge so it's like right in the middle of this video and now let's try it okay um now let's just move it down a little bit okay so now when you scroll down you can see the that unicycle moving in the background well we probably put in enough time on this so let's just update this and we're just going to check what our page looks like so far now we see when i do this and the unicycle kind of changes position we can actually fix that by the way changing the x position so it's a percentage so let's do 60 percent for the x percent or maybe 80 so now with the x position being a percentage like that if we go if we change the size of how wide the page is it's still going to be the same percentage into the page so another thing you may want to add in this section that we haven't covered yet is social icons so i'm just going to add one more section and show how you can add some social icons to share your twitter instagram youtube or any other site like that so i'm going to create a section here with two columns and in this column i'm just going to search for a widget i'm going to type in social i can bring that right into here now it defaults for facebook twitter and youtube but i can also add an item so right now it defaults to wordpress but i can just go into the icon library here and i can choose any of the other ones it's deep it's showing all these different links i could add there so i'm going to find instagram so if i just scroll up here you can see there are quite a few things we can choose from so do instagram here and insert so now it's instagram it's the instagram logo here and then you can add a link so uh for instance for youtube i'm just going to add a youtube link and we can use the official color of youtube which is red or we can do a custom color if we want to do a different color so well we have all you can add but just click here you can add a link for each social item and then you can even change the shape like right now it's rounded but we can change them to circles or square how many columns you want the alignment centered and then here i'm going to add a heading and i'm going to put follow us on social media so we have the social media and then here and then if i click here i can change the background so this section maybe i want a background overlay and i'm going to change the color to our uni orange color and then i'll update that so this is all we're going to do for our home page but let's just make sure everything's going to look good on a mobile device so i'm going to go to the responsive mode and go to mobile and so now we're just going to start the top and we're just going to scroll down okay if we go down we can see this unicycle thing this unicycle in the background it's in the corner but let's make it so just in mobile mode it's going to appear in a different spot so i'm going to click here to be editing this section and remember that was in background overlay and now we have it's showing that it's in mobile mode right here so any changes i make here it's only going to impact the mobile section so i'm going to make this kind of right in the middle and i am on the percentage here so that's good so 50 and then i am going to make this fixed and says attachment fix works only on desktop so i think that's as good as we're gonna get on this let's just move this up a little bit and i'm gonna change the opacity a little more in mobile so you can see a little better okay if we keep scrolling down here we can see this looks pretty good but how about this let's make this heading let's make it center only on mobile so i am clicking the edit button here and we can see it's showing it's only on mobile i'm going to click center so in this way we can go and make changes that only impact mobile so like for instance we made the center on mobile but if i go back to desktop it's going to be left aligned so you can make sure things look good on mobile and specify specific settings that only apply to mobile or only apply to desktop another common thing that you're going to want to change on mobile is just the the text size like the this actually looks pretty good but sometimes you're going to say oh just on mobile we want this to be a smaller text size so it's pretty straightforward if you're going to do that you just go to typography and we can see it's in mobile mode and then i'm just going to make this a smaller size when people are on mobile and then i'll just click update to save all that so now we got our homepage done we're ready to go and modify the next section of our websites so to do that i'm going to click on preview changes and once we're on preview changes we can now see the different sections here well first of all we can actually scroll down and see what this looks like and then we can go to the next section which is the about page so on the about us page i can now go to edit with elementor and you can see what we when you're editing with elementor we can't see the the heading up here and so later we're going to talk about how to modify that in this about page i'm actually going to make these a capital letters about us and you don't even have to make this an about us page you can make it something else you can use the same page in this template and modify it so it's not an about us page but i'm going to change this background picture here so i'm going to go to style choose image and i'm going to do another search and this time i'm just going to use this one here and i'm just going to have to okay something to oh let's see if i click the top button okay that looks cool it actually lined up pretty well if it didn't i can always custom the size and move this around here but i'm going to go back to what it was which was bottom center and that looks pretty good and then i'm going to scroll down and some of these things what we're not going to have for our about us page we will have this text box but i'm going to delete this image and instead of having this our mission our values and this quote i'm going to add a section with all of our team members so i'm going to click this and then we'll go to blocks like before if we scroll down we can see all these different possibilities i'm just going to go with this one so ins import block and that now we can go through and make updates so i can say our team and then i can even change the color of this if i want or change the font i'm going to go into the style and put the color well actually click the global colors and i'm going to go to uni orange and we'll keep this the same but now we can go through and change the images so instead of those images i'm going to just choose some of these other images that were already on here so i got that one and now we'll have all color images and you can see i made a mistake there obviously so this is a good time to show you about this history button so i can go to history and then i can um go back to anything so i'm going to just go back to here and so we went back a few steps in the history now i'm going to change this image to this one and then the final image and now you know there's already a section that had all these different images but i'm just showing you how you if you want to add your own section and i'm going to change some of the stuff in here so i'm going to change the style and i'm going to change the title and we're going to use uni orange and what i'm going to do is just copy this section now we can just paste the style paste the style and paste the style and now i'm just going to go into responsive mode just to make sure everything looks good when we're responsive this does look pretty good i'm going to make a change though because i actually don't want this there to be so much space on the top and bottom of this text so i'm going to click here and then we have the minimum height right now the minimum height is 420 but if i change this now there's going to be less of a space in between the top and bottom like around this text and then i can actually go through and update this image and i'm going to do custom and i'm going to just whoop not that position i'm going to change this there we go and now this girl is still lined up correctly and then i'm just going to test again on responsive mode this is good the about it's still pretty big on responsive mode i think how i when i changed it it only it it didn't only it just changed on desktop mode so i can change on mobile also here and then i'm going to update the image as well on mobile mode okay looks good now i can click update and then i will go to preview changes now this is why it's important to preview changes you can see now this isn't lined up exactly how i wanted it so let me go back to edit with elementor and i think it's because when this goes back and forth you can see the where the image is placed is different well we can fix that so i'm going to go to style image and then instead of using the pixels i'm actually going to change it to the percentage so if i change it to percentage okay this is more of what i want so it does kind of cut off the girl a little bit the head but really we're focused on the unicycle so that's looking good if i go to responsive mode well that doesn't really make difference okay so we'll update and then preview changes okay now i'm going to go to services now we can go now we can on the services page we can go through and update and customize it but i'm going to use this as an exa as an opportunity to show how to remove a section so later i'm going to remove this whole services section from the website so we're just gonna have the home about and contact so let me go to the contact page and now i'm gonna make some updates on this contact page so i'm gonna go to edit with elementor okay we can see in the contact page already there's information about where the contact information like the email phone number location and then there's this form so let's see how we're going to customize this first let's click on this text and we're going to capitalize it just use title case so just like before i'm going to change the background image so i'll have to click this up here to change the background of this section here and i will go to the style and then i'm going to choose the image and i'm going to upload a file and then i'm just going to insert the media and i'm going to change the background overlay just like before so we can see the contact us a little better and i'm going to make it so there's less space on the top and bottom so i'm going to go to layout and change this height here and i'm going to adjust this position i'm going to custom here and let's see how we want to do this actually we want this to be zero and then the y position i'm going to change the percentage okay then we can kind of see the unicycle there okay now i'll just change this i'm going to change the color of this text and we'll use the color we've been using a lot i'll go to style text color and x whoops i'm going to use the uni orange and i'm going to copy this and then i'm going to paste the style and then you can go through and update the email address and the phone number i'm just going to leave this as default for now but for the email um you can change you can change if like if you want to put a dash here or if you want to look different here and then you can obviously change the style by updating the color here and then we have the social icons down here right now so you update them just like we saw before where i can put the twitter link here and if i want to change the colors back to like right now they're all gray but i can go to style and go to official color and these will be what we would expect here and what we really need to look at is the form this is where it's going to be a a little this is going to be something new so to make it so this send message will actually send an email we're going to have to update this form so first let me apply this and update i think i just actually needed to update so to get this form all working correctly we have to do that within the wordpress dashboard instead of the elementor dashboard so let me go to exit to dashboard and i can just close that out and click here to go to the main dashboard and then i'm going to go to wp forms here so now we can see the forms and we just have one form the contact form i'm going to edit and this is the form the styling is a little different but this is basically the form that's appearing on on the website and we can add additional things so right now we're just asking for the name email address message but if we want we can add a new a new element so i'll do go to add fields and let's make a drop down and then we can change it a favorite type of unicycle and then you can make different choices tall road unicycle or offroad and then people have a drop down box and now i'm going to go over to the settings and then notifications so this is where we're going to update exactly what happens when someone clicks the submit button it's going to default be whatever email we put as the admin email but if if you want a different email that this email is sent to we can type it right here now this is the same email at freecodecamp.org is the one we were using but if you're going to update the email address here you'll you should also update the from email address and then if you want the subject of the email to be different you can change it here so this is the email that you'll be receiving when a user of the website sends submits the contact form and this information is coming directly from the contact form and then when we're done with this we just have to make sure to click save now it says after saving these settings be sure to test a form submission so you can see how it looks so you're definitely going to want to test this out just to make sure everything's working but it should all work it should all be set up to work correctly okay i'm going to go out of this and we're going to go back into our page here so if i just click here it's going to open this up and there's a few final things we want to change so we've already learned how to customize all these pages with elementor but we want to do a few more things we want to update the logo here we want to i'm going to teach you how to update this header up here including changing this number or possibly just removing the phone number and then we're going to talk about how to update this footer here so we're not going to do that from with elementor i'm going to go to the customize button right here and then i'm going to go to header builder and it says the header on this page is set from the transparent header please click the link below to customize the transparent header so do that customize transparent header and we're going to decide first we're going to decide when the header is going to be on and it's we can just on desktop desk on mobile or mobile and desktop and we want to use a different logo for the transparent parent header no we wouldn't always use the same logo and here is where we want to change the logo so i'm going to update upload a new logo and it's just this little unicycle image so this is now going to be the the logo it's going to appear right up top here and then we still are going to have to update the logo down here but we have the new logo in our header and there's plenty of websites out there that can help you make it to a logo for your website and there's also a bunch of tutorials on youtube on how to make a logo or you can get a designer that to help you make a logo for your website but it's usually pretty important but it's it's very helpful to have a logo that you can use on your website that people can start identifying your website with your logo and then we can go down here do we want a different logo for written devices no we're going to keep that off and then the logo width i think it looks pretty good but we can change the logo if we wanted to we'll let's just go back to the the default which is 60 here now i'm going to go back up and i do want to actually turn this on enable on complete website so the header will always show up and then you can choose if there's any specific places where you want to disable it so i'm just going to leave that all as default now let's go up here we're still customizing the transparent header and we're going to see what options we have on the design so we just changed the logo here but you can see that depending on what your background image is you may want some sort of color or something behind here i think it looks pretty good for this image but you may want a background overlay so if i click that see i can use some other color here i could even try to get like an orange color i can change the transparency and i can even choose one of these other colors here that we have down here and i can make it kind of transparent now i don't really think that looks better so i'm going to turn that off there but there's just one option depending on what background image you have so i'm just going to clear that and it seems like it's kind of frozen up here if any if that ever happens to you just try publishing it and then after you publish just refresh the page or sometimes it'll just does it automatically so now now it's not loading anymore but there's a bunch of things you can change here so we can do the the overlay we can also change the color some of these other things like i can change the menu color or basically the color of these these words here right now it's white but if we want to change it red in this case this is the color of our current page we're on so see when i put my mouse it says hover active so this is the active page or if i'm hovering over a page see i want to hover over it so that's i kind of like that but i'm going to make this an orange color here so now when i hover over it's going to turn orange or if we're on the page it's going to be orange and then there's just a bunch of other colors you can change depending on what you're trying to do here so that's how you're going to change the design and the logo but now let's see how we can remove some of these elements like i told you about how we're not we're going to remove the services page from our website so we want to remove that so this is not where you're going to remove this but it is where we're going to remove this phone number here see if you look at this line here we have the site logo the site title and logo we have the primary menu and we have a button well the button is this thing right here so i'm just going to click remove the button and then it's going to remove that okay now i'm going to try to change the logo for this footer down here so there's a few ways i can just start clicking i can click this edit button here or i can back up here and then i'm going to go to the footer builder and then i will go to the design and then i will go to this see this html one that's the logo here so if i click in here we can see it's just an image that's right in here so i'm going to delete this image and then i can either just leave it deleted or i can add the logo again so to add the logo again i'm going to do this and then add media just click there insert into post and then i'm going to actually make it a lot smaller and then we can see that little unicycle see once we change the size here it changes the size here you can see that that says copyright is the copyright right here this thing right here we have the footer i mean we have the footer menu which is this menu right here and then we have this logo here so i don't actually want this copy to say this i'm going to change it so i'm going to click here and it's going to say made by bow and it's kind of off to the side here so let's see if i how i can change the design a little bit so it's not so far to the side now it's already showing a margin of 40 but i think i'm going to actually have to change this this layout here and i'm going to put some padding on the right okay sometimes you just have to go just try out different things to figure out where you have to add the padding i had already tried to add the padding in one other spot i tried to add the padding here but or the margin here but it didn't increase anything so i just added had to add the padding on this whole section here okay now i'm going to teach you how to remove the the item from the menu it's not on this page surprisingly because if i click to click edit here um oh i guess it does say configure menu from here but i don't think i'm going to be able to remove an element from that menu so no yeah so i'm not going to be able to remove anything from the menu here so to remove something from the menu i have to well first of all i'm going to publish what i have and then i'm going to go back to the main wordpress page the main wordpress dashboard now i'm going to go to appearance and well and then menus here okay so we have these this menu the main menu and you can see home about service contact well i want to remove services i'm going to click here and i can do the drop down here and then remove and i'll just save the menu okay let me go back to the page now we see it says home about contact if i scroll down to the bottom home about contact so we've successfully removed that page so let's say you want to add a whole new page to this menu so to remove a page you just saw how to do that but to add a page first you're going to click or hover over the new button and then go to page and so you can and then after you're adding a page i can just click edit with elementor and so now it's a page with nothing it has a header it has a footer but it doesn't have anything else i may want to go into here go into the blocks and i can actually sort by different thing i'm going to hero because usually you want some sort of big thing at the top and i'm going to put this and i'm going to import this block and then i could go through and edit the page just like what we've been learning i'm actually just going to put a solid color here as the background this is just a super quick example we're not going to use this in the page but i'm also going to change this to just a blue up here and then i just want to show you how you would add this new section to the page so it just loaded this image from just the the template here for the this top section here but if i click publish and let's say i want to add this to a link well it says hooray your page is live have a look so this is the page but it's not showing in the menu up here so if i wanted to get this page in the menu i could go to this button here go back to the main wordpress menu now if i look at the pages i can see the page that was just added so let's see if this is the page i just added if i click view yep this is the page i just added so i'm going to go back here and i'm going to do a quick edit so i can edit the title and this is just going to be called new page and the slug will just be new page the slug is just what's going to appear in the url and i'll click update and then i can add that to the menu if i want want to by just going to appearance menus and we have the new page here so i can click add to menu and it would be here and i could put it right before the contact now i'm going to be deleting this in a second but i just want to show you how you would add a brand new page to a menu so let me go here to visit the site i'm on the about page and you can see the new page shows up right here right in the menu so let's go and delete that new page now i'm going to go back to the wordpress menu i'm going to go back to the menu so that's appearance and menus and then i will just remove the new page and i can also go whoops i forgot to save this so save the menu and then i will go to pages just see all the pages and we can delete that new page and we also can delete the services we're not going to use that so i'm just going to do bulk action move to trash and i'm just going to close these and our page is pretty much done we're just going to go over some final settings so you can see it says love nature up here that was the default name so let's change that to what we want to be so i'm going to go to settings here and then we can change the name of the the title and the tagline this is important because it is going to appear in some places so you want to make sure it's accurate so for the site title we'll just put in the unicycle store the place to buy unicycles and by the way i did not set this up as an online store but i do have another tutorial about how to create a wordpress online store so you can check that out if you want and i'll put the link to that in the description and then let's just go down here and then see if there's any other settings we want to update so you can you can change the date format that's going to appear or the time format now this is mainly going to appear if you were doing a blog post in this tutorial we did not cover how to make blog posts but uh if if you want you can update these formats you can change when the week starts on i'm going to say it starts on a sunday and then i'm going to go to save changes okay our page is basically done and we have learned the basics of elementor you can see as i was demonstrating things there's just a bunch more menu so this was kind of learning the basics and you should now know enough to start figuring out more things on your own you just explore the menus and remember when you're doing things in the menus you can always do the undo you can always go back in the history so you don't have to worry about messing anything up you now know the basics of using elementor to create and customize your website thanks for watching and good luck on creating your own website
