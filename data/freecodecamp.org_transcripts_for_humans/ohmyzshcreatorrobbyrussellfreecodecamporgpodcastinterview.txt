00:00 - [Music]
00:15 - we're here with Robbie Russell founder
00:18 - co-founder of Planet argon Studios and
00:20 - creator of the very popular oh my
00:24 - zsh uh open source repository and Tool
00:29 - yeah thanks thanks for having me joining
00:32 - us from beautiful Portland Oregon uh his
00:35 - adopted home yeah I've been here for
00:40 - 20 what year is it 20 2024 oh my gosh uh
00:44 - it'll be 24 years in uh July I guess
00:46 - that I moved here so yeah more half of
00:49 - my life now yeah and uh originally from
00:53 - California G yeah I grew up in yeah just
00:56 - south of uh like Silicon Valley my dad
00:59 - worked in Silicon Valley and hardware
01:02 - and we lived in a little small suburb
01:04 - town that was kind of on the edge of
01:07 - very Southern there's like I don't
01:09 - remember if it's actually the furthest
01:11 - south town in Santa clar County but yeah
01:15 - it's um it's kind of like at the time is
01:17 - very
01:19 - farmland and you know track houses and
01:22 - stuff like that and so was maybe about
01:24 - an hour and a half or so South of San
01:26 - Francisco and maybe 45 minutes south of
01:28 - San Jose yeah and uh Gilroy that's like
01:32 - garlick town right is that is that the
01:34 - like the world capital of garlic the
01:37 - crop it likes to call itself that um I
01:40 - don't know that it's actually where most
01:41 - of garlic is produced nowadays I think
01:43 - most of it's actually produced in China
01:45 - um but yeah there was a huge uh garlic
01:48 - scene there if you will uh it smelled
01:51 - like garlic people it's either you loved
01:53 - it or ha it if you drove through our
01:54 - town um coincidentally the town just
01:57 - north of us had had a lot of mushrooms
01:59 - that they grew and so their Town smell
02:01 - like poop can I swear on this podcast
02:05 - smell like but they were like
02:07 - slightly wealthier town and so there was
02:08 - this weird competitive thing and like
02:10 - your town smells you guys are poor down
02:12 - in gory they made the the the fossi and
02:14 - bargain yeah our Town's going to smell
02:16 - terrible but we're going to be slightly
02:18 - better off than our neighbors exactly um
02:20 - so yeah I grew up in the garlic Capital
02:22 - world and all I wanted to do as soon as
02:25 - I became a teenager was figure out how
02:26 - to get out of living in gy and move to a
02:29 - some sort of city Urban environment
02:32 - that's what I wanted to be around yeah
02:35 - right on man well uh obviously you found
02:38 - Portland to be like a a good place to be
02:41 - because you've been there for like
02:43 - basically your entire adult life most of
02:45 - it um you've got like a very um I mean
02:49 - you're very very portlandian in like
02:52 - pretty much um your interests and things
02:55 - that you do you're like very outdoorsy
02:57 - from what I understand and um yeah like
03:01 - what what inspired you to go to Portland
03:03 - specifically and uh it was really cool
03:05 - by the way hanging out eating tacos with
03:07 - you it was it was good that we got the
03:08 - chat and um I didn't I didn't know what
03:10 - to expect from the conversation and yeah
03:12 - we had a number of tacos and talked
03:15 - about all facets of life um with you and
03:17 - Abby over there at free Cod Camp um
03:19 - who's become a really good friend
03:20 - coincidentally um thanks to free code
03:22 - Camp uh we can talk about that if you
03:24 - want to but um yeah think about why did
03:27 - I move to Portland well the short story
03:29 - is that I didn't know what I wanted to
03:31 - do with my life my career I didn't have
03:34 - any like real I was painting houses for
03:36 - about three years prior to moving
03:40 - to Portland I I since I was 17 I dropped
03:44 - out of high school halfway through my
03:46 - junior year and then ended up getting a
03:48 - job with like a painting company that my
03:51 - my one of my uncles worked at and learn
03:54 - to sand and touch up and eventually
03:57 - learn how to paint and take care of wood
04:00 - and paint
04:03 - roof the things that are on I forget
04:05 - what they're called flashing flashing
04:07 - and all the the things flashing gutters
04:09 - yeah flashing is like the metal stuff
04:11 - that might be covering like there'll be
04:12 - like you know air vents on top of a
04:14 - house anyways I got to learn how to
04:16 - paint houses for really fancy really
04:18 - fancy houses in uh Santa Clara County um
04:22 - like we occasionally work on you know
04:24 - multi-million dollar houses for people
04:27 - that work in Silicon Valley or maybe
04:29 - they were like they they're like um like
04:32 - one of the players or something from
04:33 - like the the San Jose Sharks a hockey
04:35 - team like their big you know big house
04:38 - they were building up on the hills and
04:39 - so I got to work on those types of
04:40 - projects which were not like kind of get
04:42 - in and get out short projects they were
04:44 - very much like we would be there for
04:46 - like a month two months working on
04:48 - painting and prepping and painting
04:50 - working as their house was being built
04:51 - and making nice cabinets and so we would
04:53 - make paint or cabinets like the big
04:56 - style at the time was making cabinets
04:58 - look like they were basically White
04:59 - plastic even though it was like really
05:01 - fancy wood I don't such a weird how
05:03 - Styles change over time quirky in
05:06 - interior decorating train right so I
05:08 - learned a lot about like the craft and
05:11 - how much work went into prepping before
05:13 - you even pulled the paint out right
05:15 - before the paint dries and then touching
05:16 - up and taking care of that stuff um when
05:20 - I was a teenager after having dropped
05:22 - out of high school and so that's that's
05:23 - what I was doing and I'm like I actually
05:25 - thought I might if you do I think in
05:27 - California I don't know if it's like
05:28 - that all states but
05:30 - before you could start like your own say
05:32 - painting company if I had I I kind of
05:34 - had a little bit of aspiration like oh
05:36 - maybe one day I'll I'll run a painting
05:37 - company like I think I could probably do
05:39 - this and have some people maybe work for
05:41 - me and I'll just work in construction
05:43 - but that also the reality was it would
05:45 - mean that I'd be working construction
05:47 - and I didn't find that you know it's
05:49 - funny that we talk about diversity in
05:51 - Tech over the years and I'm like
05:53 - construction was there was a lot of
05:56 - cultural diversity um where people were
05:59 - from and stuff but it was mostly male
06:01 - dominated and I didn't really like
06:02 - working with just men all the time and
06:05 - so I thought that was you know that that
06:07 - was actually one of the things I thought
06:08 - it was a very toxic environment as a I
06:12 - kind of saw myself as this kind of
06:13 - anarcho uh punk rock kid who was trying
06:17 - to like you know pushing you know like I
06:20 - want my gay friends to be able to get
06:21 - married and like here I'm going to work
06:22 - every day and everybody's talking in
06:23 - very conservative and very
06:24 - male-dominated environment and kind of
06:28 - objectified women and when whenever we'd
06:30 - see women on the like the job sites that
06:33 - was like always like you know there's a
06:35 - lot of cat calling and stuff and I'm
06:36 - like this is not an environment that I
06:38 - feel like I want to spend a lot of time
06:40 - in um so anyways we that's a whole story
06:43 - and of itself so I decided I wasn't
06:45 - going to do that forever and like this
06:46 - is like I didn't want to work around
06:47 - that environment forever so uh I wanted
06:51 - to move to a city and I didn't make very
06:52 - much money painting and I didn't and I
06:55 - was like well I was kind of doing some
06:56 - odd jobs here and there doing some like
06:57 - tech support stuff and so but the price
07:00 - to live in Portland was technically
07:02 - cheaper than it was in Gilroy
07:04 - interesting and it was like it was a
07:05 - city that had vegetarian restaurants
07:07 - like punk rock scene um I can go see
07:10 - music it felt relatively clean um as a
07:14 - city in the sense like you walk around
07:15 - downtown and there' be like you know
07:16 - some gutter Punk kids and I'm like well
07:18 - worst case if I don't find a job here I
07:21 - can just be a gutter Punk kid and get a
07:23 - dog and just kind of hang around and um
07:25 - I'll just I'll figure it out I'm just
07:27 - like maybe kind of glamorized this like
07:30 - DIY lifestyle and Portland has exuded
07:33 - that I I would have loved to moved to
07:35 - Berkeley or Santa San Francisco or Santa
07:38 - Cruz but I couldn't I couldn't afford
07:40 - that those are expensive cities to live
07:42 - in I didn't know it wasn't programming
07:44 - or anything at that point um much to
07:47 - speak of anyways um not thinking that
07:49 - would be a viable thing and the other
07:50 - part of like wanting to move out of
07:52 - California was that I felt like
07:53 - everything was kind of driven towards
07:54 - hey if you should work in the computer
07:57 - industry that like my father worked in
07:59 - Silicon Valley he just retired a couple
08:02 - months ago he worked in hardware and he
08:04 - was always like you need to you should
08:05 - really be interested in software he was
08:07 - always trying to encourage me to get
08:09 - interested in software buy me books on
08:10 - softare I always I always had computers
08:12 - around I had my very my own computer
08:14 - which was always like my dad's the one
08:16 - he basically would grow out of I got the
08:19 - one he get the he get a 386 I got the
08:22 - 286 he got the 486 I got the 386 and so
08:25 - it just be I just learned how to work
08:27 - around with computers a lot as a kids
08:29 - using them to play games and using some
08:32 - of the the software that would come on
08:33 - it making cool
08:35 - little spreadsheets and stuff like that
08:37 - or Ms paint or playing weird games on
08:40 - the you know command line games and
08:41 - stuff like that but uh I just never
08:45 - resonated with me like learning how to
08:47 - programming I just thought it was it it
08:49 - didn't seem like an interesting thing
08:50 - for whatever reason it was like because
08:51 - it was always presented as like hey if
08:53 - you learn if you write out this code
08:56 - into this you know this editor thing um
08:58 - andun run it then you can play the game
09:01 - and I was like okay so I'd be maybe
09:04 - typing what it was doing for I get bored
09:06 - like I've just like you know basically
09:08 - rewriting something from a book yeah
09:10 - under the computer I'm like I'm can I go
09:12 - outside and play with my friends I'm G
09:13 - to go do that you know this is like can
09:15 - I just play the game someone already did
09:17 - it and yeah you're basically doing
09:19 - rework I mean there was definitely a
09:20 - time where there just wasn't enough
09:21 - memory and like it was more practical to
09:24 - distribute printed copies of the code
09:26 - and have people type it in themselves
09:28 - but I'm sure that by the time you were a
09:30 - kid that that time had passed and it was
09:32 - more like a an exercise yeah it was more
09:34 - of the exercise like learning it was
09:36 - never really presented as like well if
09:38 - you get it to run and then we can then
09:41 - change it make different you know modify
09:45 - it to do something a little differently
09:46 - let's change like we never had that
09:49 - conversation so I never that there was
09:51 - never that little aha moment of like o I
09:53 - can do something different with it um
09:55 - and so I wrote a couple blog posts in
09:56 - the past about like how my my dad failed
09:59 - to teach me or get me excited about
10:01 - programming um when I was young and I
10:04 - think it was just like we're that was
10:05 - the ingredient that I think I was
10:06 - missing was like wouldn't it be kind of
10:09 - neat if we can make something to do X Y
10:10 - and Z and then let's figure that out
10:12 - which I think speaks to how I learned
10:15 - about things and why so so very
10:16 - practical kind of appli like you don't
10:20 - seem to me like the person who Geeks out
10:22 - on technology for the sake of Technology
10:24 - itself it's all about what can this
10:25 - technology do for me exactly um
10:30 - the you know I think if he had you know
10:33 - I played I played you know Little League
10:34 - baseball and things like that as a kid
10:36 - and um so what like I remember I was
10:39 - really interested in stats for for our
10:42 - team and so we would track the stats for
10:44 - our game you know for for all of our
10:45 - players couple years I would do this and
10:47 - then I would like and my dad and I would
10:49 - like put some stuff together in like a
10:50 - spreadsheet and then like regenerate
10:52 - this thing and I bring a print out to
10:53 - the team you'd be like here's your stats
10:55 - for the season you know like here's your
10:57 - on based things and your your batting
10:59 - average and pitching details and so we
11:02 - could track some of that stuff over time
11:03 - because uh there wasn't like a web page
11:05 - or anything that kids this you know this
11:06 - is all late 80s early 90s yeah period of
11:10 - time and so if we had had a conversation
11:13 - like wouldn't it be cool like if we
11:14 - could build a little tool that maybe
11:17 - every week you come back from the game
11:18 - and like plug in the new numbers and
11:20 - then it would regenerate the report or
11:22 - something like that probably would have
11:24 - I probably would have that would have
11:25 - resonated I think really well with me
11:27 - but it was that wasn't what we did we we
11:29 - learned I got to learn how to use
11:30 - spreadsheets and stuff like that I think
11:31 - it was like Lotus 123 or something back
11:34 - then but so I still got to learn how to
11:36 - use the tools that you could use and you
11:38 - know like build spreadsheets and stuff
11:40 - like that and coincidentally another
11:41 - thing my dad kind of encouraged was we
11:44 - were always bu building our own
11:46 - computers so we would go buy all the
11:47 - parts and then we put it together and so
11:49 - I learned how to do that with him and I
11:51 - became like this weird thing where he
11:52 - would kind of show off to his friends
11:54 - because they would want to get a
11:55 - computer and maybe they weren't they
11:57 - didn't work in the computer industry
11:59 - um that's I'm just going to say the
12:01 - computer because that's how I refer to
12:03 - it that's how my dad and people referred
12:06 - to it like oh they work in computers
12:07 - that's kind of what we said like now
12:09 - it's like everybody works in now we use
12:10 - like we work in Tech and that's a weird
12:12 - yeah thing to call it as well but the
12:16 - there was this like we' build it and
12:18 - then we like you know maybe a neighbor
12:19 - would get their first computer and then
12:21 - I I would be then sent over for a week
12:23 - or two every couple couple like maybe an
12:25 - hour a couple times a week to teach them
12:27 - how to do stuff on it and so be like
12:28 - here show them how to like open up Word
12:31 - Perfect or how to use the spreadsh thing
12:33 - or how to teach the kids how they can
12:34 - start the games themselves you know and
12:37 - put the floppy thing in here's how to
12:38 - install it but then here's some
12:39 - shortcuts you can add to your DOS prompt
12:42 - to like here's the commands you you you
12:44 - run to like launch you know to play
12:46 - Commander Keen or something and so that
12:50 - became something like I kind of was good
12:52 - at maybe teaching people how to do
12:54 - things like it um and showing them like
12:56 - well if you know if my dad's kid kid
12:59 - could figure this out I could probably
13:00 - figure it out you know like so I was
13:02 - kind of paraded around in that sort of
13:04 - way like some of the so it sounds like
13:07 - the fact that your dad was you know
13:09 - encouraging you and that you had
13:11 - Hardware on hand I mean uh that you did
13:13 - have kind of like
13:15 - uh what many people would call like like
13:19 - uh an ideal kind of
13:22 - like um ground soil for growing as a
13:26 - potential developer in growing up around
13:29 - the tools uh having somebody in your
13:31 - life who was already making a living
13:33 - from these tools and and that kind of
13:35 - seed the seeds of later on when you were
13:39 - you know considering your options uh
13:42 - potentially getting more into computers
13:44 - maybe you could talk a little bit about
13:45 - that that period where you wanted to go
13:48 - into business and pot you you were
13:49 - ambitious you wanted to have uh a
13:52 - company that was potentially going
13:53 - around painting but you you weren't like
13:55 - in love with the kind of construction
13:57 - work culture will what what did you do
14:00 - how did you go about uh ultimately
14:03 - creating a consultancy like what what
14:05 - was the uh process in between those two
14:10 - points there's there's a couple of
14:12 - factors and you know I haven't really
14:14 - spent a lot of time reflecting on this
14:15 - specific point but I feel like in this
14:17 - conversation is kind of highlighting
14:19 - something that
14:20 - I you know earlier I mentioned that I
14:23 - kind of was I I in during that same time
14:27 - that I was painting I was obs obsessed
14:29 - with DIY punk rock culture East Bay East
14:33 - Bay Port um and East Bay um in the Bay
14:36 - Area in California uh it was like a lot
14:38 - of punk bands came out of that area
14:40 - there was like a lot of small record
14:42 - companies that were like it was just
14:44 - like kids that were maybe four to five
14:46 - years older than me had running record
14:49 - labels selling stickers through
14:51 - cataloges and I started one my my very
14:54 - first business was a sticker company and
14:56 - it was like Punk stickers.com and I was
14:58 - like I'm going to oh you had punk
14:59 - stickers.com you had that domain did I
15:01 - did pretty good domain um and then I
15:03 - lost it and I recently just negotiated
15:06 - buying it again but I don't know what
15:07 - I'm going to do with that uh we'll see
15:08 - um but the idea was like I wanted to
15:11 - sell stickers for bands and and make and
15:13 - also political activist stickers and
15:15 - there was someone up in but so I like
15:17 - looked up to these people that had I we
15:19 - go to like anarchus Book Fairs in San in
15:21 - San Francisco and stuff and like people
15:23 - were like all these self-published
15:24 - people that were writing books and Zen
15:26 - and so I had a Zen as well and I was
15:29 - like for like music related stuff and I
15:31 - was like I was just really fascinated
15:34 - with this idea that like there's I was
15:35 - finding a community people that were
15:37 - kind of kind of content creators selling
15:40 - like their Wares but kind of being a
15:42 - little you know just doing your doing it
15:44 - yourself and not wanting to work for
15:46 - someone else it was more like I'm going
15:47 - to go find my own thing and I think that
15:48 - was very much a an ethos of that era
15:51 - with like indie film you know was like
15:54 - people like I think I would like I would
15:55 - have loved to I just wanted to do
15:56 - something interesting and I what you
15:58 - know I thought was interesting and
15:59 - creative that I can kind of build my own
16:02 - destiny and not end up working my
16:04 - biggest fear was ending up in a cubicle
16:06 - in Silicon Valley I'm like that's my
16:08 - intive with computer industry was I'll
16:10 - be working in a cubicle somewhere there
16:12 - will be Windows way down a
16:14 - hallway um far far away and not that you
16:17 - know I I go to my dad's my dad worked in
16:19 - hardware and specifically in hard um
16:21 - hard drive manufacturing yeah and so I
16:24 - would go to the I would go to work with
16:25 - them every once in a while which I
16:27 - enjoyed cuz I would get this meet all
16:28 - these interesting people from all walks
16:29 - of life and people coding and and going
16:33 - in like the the the clean rooms and
16:36 - stuff and seeing stuff how stuff was
16:37 - built but there was but I was like there
16:40 - was something about that lifestyle for
16:42 - whatever reason I don't I don't know if
16:43 - I was like subjected to some maybe it
16:47 - might have just been like punk rock
16:48 - music and being just like rebelling and
16:50 - like I don't want to do what you want me
16:52 - to do dad which was probably to get a
16:53 - safe job in Silicon Valley like my
16:55 - grandfather did my grandfather worked at
16:57 - like he worked in Tech as well like was
17:00 - a traveling consultant and worked at
17:02 - like Atari early on and like so there's
17:04 - like I always had like that was
17:06 - like that was like my legacy of like
17:08 - this is what you're supposed to do and I
17:10 - was like that I want to go do I
17:12 - want to go kind I want to be a musician
17:14 - I'm going to make stickers I going to do
17:16 - my own thing um which I think was even
17:18 - like when I thought about being a
17:20 - painter and having my own company was
17:21 - more like I feel like someone else is
17:23 - making money off of my time why don't I
17:26 - just go do this myself and I don't know
17:28 - that I thought a lot about building a
17:29 - company that would have employees
17:31 - necessar so that was like that
17:33 - definitely cuz I I think I was always
17:35 - skeptical of people in power you know in
17:37 - leadership positions and so I think
17:40 - there was a there was a little bit of
17:42 - that and so uh which I think comes back
17:43 - to the how Planet argon started in the
17:45 - early years of I'm trying to think how
17:48 - to th thread the needle there because
17:49 - I'm kind of going back a little bit
17:51 - there but there's yeah but going to
17:52 - Portland was very much a hey I want to
17:55 - I'm going to go see if I can make it and
17:56 - do something on my own and ended up
17:58 - coincidentally my first job in Portland
18:00 - was a job in a cubicle doing tech
18:04 - support for a couple so you got a taste
18:06 - of like your your greatest fear
18:08 - essentially um just like like
18:10 - circumstance propelled you into a
18:12 - situation where you couldn't deny your
18:14 - destiny as an IT worker as a Dilbert
18:17 - character indeed uh exactly Dilbert
18:20 - character uh I was obsessed with Dilbert
18:22 - back then
18:23 - um
18:25 - but and then that show so during that
18:29 - period of time where I'm doing it
18:31 - support for about 200 people in the
18:33 - company and I started to you know
18:38 - basically a lot of going around help
18:39 - people fix their stuff that was problems
18:41 - on their computer um setting up new
18:43 - machines because we were hiring a bunch
18:44 - of people you know that's doing you know
18:46 - part of the onboarding and and and
18:48 - helping people upgrade their systems but
18:50 - people would come with a lot of similar
18:52 - questions you know things and I was like
18:54 - oh it'd be really easy if I just created
18:56 - like this I had already started making
18:58 - we pages and stuff like that for like my
18:59 - sticker company for my zen and some
19:02 - other like little personal projects and
19:04 - some for for some bands and stuff like
19:06 - that and so I was learning how to build
19:08 - some web pages because I wanted to my
19:10 - first entry into programming kind of
19:12 - like really doing anything like web
19:14 - based was like being able to I wanted
19:16 - people to make a request to order some
19:18 - stickers and so I'm like well how do I
19:19 - build a web page and so I figured out
19:21 - how to like I couldn't I was going to
19:24 - pay someone to build me like a form that
19:26 - could collect data from people and so I
19:28 - I learned how to maybe do something with
19:30 - like I remember if it was Microsoft
19:32 - front page or something eventually I
19:33 - learned how to do it in like with some
19:35 - CGI scripts with pearl so I was like
19:38 - just picking up some books I'm like how
19:39 - do I have like a form saved to like a
19:42 - CSV file or a text file and I can FTP
19:45 - that file down and see if anyone ordered
19:46 - any new stickers um
19:50 - and that that was like my entry into
19:53 - kind of doing a little bit of
19:54 - programming but it was because I wanted
19:56 - to sell stickers so how do I make that
19:59 - happen and so that those types of skills
20:02 - start to slowly start to accumulate so
20:04 - by the time I'm um actually at this job
20:05 - doing text support and I'm helping
20:07 - people I start putting together some web
20:09 - pages like on an internet um because I
20:11 - knew how to like spin up like a Linux
20:13 - server and run what what year was this
20:16 - approximately uh that job I moved to
20:18 - Portland in 2000 so that was like you
20:20 - know fall winter of 200000 um I was
20:24 - starting to do some of that stuff and so
20:27 - so that
20:28 - company you know they they were an event
20:31 - management company and so we did I was
20:33 - helping people do a lot of like CSV or
20:37 - Excel file dding stuff and like so I'm
20:40 - like here's like I could build like a
20:41 - little script to help out with some of
20:42 - these CSV D duping things I started
20:45 - making like tutorials where it' be like
20:46 - a bunch of screenshots so like here's
20:48 - how to set your out of out of office
20:51 - Auto repes so it doesn't create an
20:52 - infinite loop with someone else that
20:54 - also is on vacation that can be uh
20:56 - problematic that used to happen back
20:58 - then on email servers um but so they
21:02 - there was the company started to notice
21:04 - that I was doing this and there was
21:05 - another department of the company that
21:07 - was actually like a web development team
21:09 - for our custo like the company's
21:12 - customers and they're like hey why are
21:15 - you doing all this web stuff like why
21:17 - aren like that should be us that's doing
21:19 - they were kind of like a little bit like
21:20 - why are you so was like territorial a
21:22 - little bit and then and in 2001 they
21:25 - they announced some layoffs and then I
21:27 - did not get laid off but then they
21:29 - called me and do they're like hey if you
21:31 - want to keep your if you want to stay
21:33 - working here we have a role we think you
21:35 - could be a junior web developer for us
21:37 - because you're already doing some of
21:38 - this stuff so would you consider moving
21:40 - over to this other department and I was
21:44 - like oh I get to just do that stuff all
21:45 - the time and not have to go around
21:47 - people's computers and and like and like
21:50 - do I get to keep work and and you can
21:51 - get to keep working on the internet
21:52 - because everybody started to really like
21:53 - it and um that was a whole thing of like
21:56 - I remember them even thinking like it
21:58 - was like a new idea for them and it was
22:00 - only because I just started doing it and
22:01 - I was like ah I'm just going to make
22:02 - this to make my job easier and here's a
22:04 - link you can solve this problem yourself
22:06 - now um so I moved to the the web team
22:09 - and so personally I was like learning
22:12 - how to do some stuff with pearl and PHP
22:14 - but the company they weren't going to
22:16 - touch any open source stuff like that
22:17 - they were all using Microsoft um ASP
22:21 - back then net had I don't think it had
22:23 - just come out I remember going to the
22:24 - net launch though with that team but so
22:27 - they so during the day I was learning
22:29 - how to do stuff with Microsoft SQL
22:31 - server and kind of learning they're
22:34 - basically putting me on these repetitive
22:35 - projects where I was spinning up these
22:37 - like complex registration forms for
22:39 - these events and I would then go home
22:41 - and like well how do I apply what I
22:43 - learned at work today in this other
22:45 - technology stuff that I'm way more
22:46 - excited about which was like open source
22:48 - because it was all that open source
22:51 - World resonated with a DI iy mentality
22:54 - there was a lot of you know free stuff
22:56 - out there I could just download and spin
22:58 - up a website really quickly for some
23:00 - project for a band or for some activist
23:02 - project I was being a part of and so I I
23:06 - was kind of doing this like my
23:07 - Moonlighting thing was I'm doing open
23:10 - source stuff at night having fun with
23:11 - you know trying to learn how to Tinker
23:13 - with things and building my own projects
23:15 - and then uh and building some really
23:17 - really horrible like PHP minus schl
23:19 - things and if anyone really went down
23:20 - the rabbit hole and searched me on
23:22 - Source Forge you could find some
23:24 - probably embarrassing code there that
23:25 - was probably security written and should
23:28 - not be run anywhere but it was running
23:29 - at my company on their internet they
23:31 - would allow me to use the open source
23:33 - stuff for the internet stuff but not on
23:34 - our client work that was too risky um to
23:37 - go into that t but anyway so Planet
23:40 - argon started in 2002 as me saying you
23:44 - know what because I started realizing I
23:46 - was I was building up all the skill set
23:48 - and people started asking me like hey
23:49 - will you work on this project for my
23:51 - business like I have a consulting
23:53 - company where I do this thing and can
23:54 - you build me a website that I and I was
23:56 - like well yeah I can do that but but I'm
23:58 - going to I will only do it if I can
24:00 - build some functionality that you allow
24:02 - you to make changes for yourself like a
24:04 - CMS type tool or something so that you
24:06 - don't have to call me every time you
24:07 - want to like change some copy on your
24:09 - website um because I don't I don't want
24:11 - to do that you know yeah that's like the
24:14 - the first evolution as a freelancer is
24:17 - like you you realize oh no I'm these
24:19 - calls are never going to go away like
24:21 - exact there will always the updates
24:22 - needed made I need to figure out a
24:24 - process essentially of like delegating
24:27 - the change back to the client exactly so
24:30 - that's that's kind of how that the
24:32 - Consulting part started so
24:34 - 2002 is when Planet oron created as this
24:38 - thing and and coincidentally my partner
24:40 - at the time she was a designer and so so
24:44 - she and I uh girlfriend at the time we
24:47 - so we would occasionally work up on work
24:48 - on projects together and so the so the
24:51 - day like I remember sitting there in our
24:53 - apartment we were talking through like
24:55 - hey let's she already had like a design
24:58 - thing so she was doing design work with
24:59 - some clients and that would be like
25:01 - print and web based digital stuff like
25:04 - brochures and things that she would do
25:06 - and I've had this programming skill set
25:08 - and like okay maybe we can collaborate
25:09 - on some projects so I had my business
25:12 - and she had her business um but she was
25:14 - there the day that like Planet Aron
25:15 - started and like touched almost she did
25:17 - the first website designed my first
25:19 - business card she was there when we
25:21 - talked through all the different bit U
25:23 - naming ideas and before we came up with
25:25 - the idea for Planet argon and how that
25:26 - came to be own story but yeah yeah what
25:29 - is the story behind that so so I like uh
25:32 - so for a long time I would make it be
25:34 - kind of a mystery and I would always
25:35 - give this book to my employees I don't
25:37 - know if You' ever heard of the author um
25:40 - Tom Robbins by chance I haven't uh he's
25:44 - pretty well known in the Pacific
25:45 - Northwest he wrote like even cowg girls
25:47 - get the blues and there one of his books
25:50 - called still life with woodpecker and
25:52 - it's about an
25:53 - anarchist um terrorist coincidentally
25:56 - but and like an ex princess who fall in
25:58 - love with each other um and there's this
26:03 - whole he has anyways he the the main
26:06 - character is a redhead and there's the
26:11 - way the the the author is very Kurt vona
26:13 - esque in some ways but he'll have these
26:14 - like chapters where he goes off and
26:15 - these big random rants about or
26:17 - ramblings about things that are
26:19 - completely unrelated to the story but
26:21 - anyway I love this book when I was like
26:23 - you know late teenager and Planet argon
26:26 - there was this like Back stories about
26:28 - where like the pyramids came from was
26:30 - actually there's a theory that like it
26:32 - came from the redbeards which uh like
26:35 - redheads with their technology because
26:37 - they were sent away from this other
26:38 - planet sent to planet Earth because they
26:41 - were obnoxious human beings and so they
26:43 - were redheads were so went not visually
26:47 - seeing this conversation I I have red
26:49 - hair so plan discriminating against your
26:52 - own essentially uh Planet argon is where
26:56 - red heads came from According to this
26:58 - book as like a kind of like quirky
26:59 - little Side Story thing um because they
27:02 - were obnoxious and the people there did
27:04 - not want redheads there and I don't
27:06 - blame them we're we're horrible so
27:08 - anyhow interesting so so it's not Rel
27:11 - like because I think I've heard you ask
27:13 - uh in the past maybe on the your podcast
27:16 - like what's your favorite noble
27:19 - gas you'd think it would be
27:21 - argon and you know we've had I think
27:24 - maybe four or five phone calls or a
27:26 - company people trying to
27:28 - purchase argon and so i' always wonder
27:31 - if that was the business I should have
27:32 - went into but uh really like people
27:36 - people want to buy the actual yeah gas
27:38 - for industrial us maybe Planet argon
27:41 - sales argon uh no we don't but neon's my
27:45 - favorite noble gas like that just some
27:47 - cool stuff but argon I've seen some
27:49 - really cool use of it um there's a like
27:51 - a children's uh science museum museum
27:54 - here in Portland Oregon that they have a
27:56 - bunch of stuff in the show how different
27:58 - gases look and so there's some cool
28:00 - stuff with argon as well and so it can
28:02 - look it can look pretty cool I don't
28:03 - know a lot about all the noble gases
28:05 - admittedly when we had early on in plan
28:07 - Aron when we had when we start we have
28:09 - employees and we were offering hosting
28:10 - services and we had all of our own
28:12 - servers in Iraq all of our servers were
28:14 - named after noble gases and and it was
28:17 - like Xenon and argon and neon and so I
28:20 - have uh there there's yeah you run out
28:23 - pretty quick though you do you do so we
28:25 - had to like kind of like go a little bit
28:26 - outside of that and eventually we're
28:28 - like let's just we're we're running out
28:30 - of noble gases maybe we should stop
28:31 - doing hosting as a business anyways I
28:33 - don't want to have to touch physical
28:34 - Hardware anymore on than yeah yeah and
28:37 - um so let's talk a little bit about like
28:40 - the great middle because I think a lot
28:42 - of people create a consultancy and it's
28:44 - just them and maybe their significant
28:45 - other a few friends and it is fine and
28:49 - it provides a livelihood for the people
28:52 - involved but you've done something
28:54 - different in that you've stuck with it
28:55 - for a long period of time I'm I'm sure
28:57 - you've had lots of opportunities to go
28:59 - work at Big Tech and do stuff like that
29:01 - but but you've kind of stuck to running
29:04 - this consultancy and growing this
29:06 - consultancy um and I'd like to hear
29:08 - about the growth and how you managed to
29:11 - grow it and what what that process was
29:14 - like and maybe some of the pain points I
29:16 - I can definitely interject with the
29:17 - other questions I'm going to step back
29:19 - and just kind of hear what what were
29:20 - those first few years a growth like for
29:22 - you yeah well the first few years there
29:26 - was like no growth uh uh so 2002 is when
29:28 - I started as a you know the Moonlighting
29:31 - type of thing where I worked on some
29:32 - projects here and there um you know it
29:35 - was just enough to have to file taxes
29:37 - you know um but I was I still had a job
29:40 - you know full a day job and then I ended
29:41 - up working actually briefly at a another
29:44 - consultancy that actually got that
29:46 - worked in open source specifically and
29:48 - they're they were known for being
29:50 - experts in post Rescue all and so I was
29:53 - I went there for about a maybe a year
29:54 - and a half or so and it was like and
29:57 - that was was a pretty small company of
29:58 - like less you know there was maybe four
29:59 - or five of us consistently and I was
30:02 - like you know what I think maybe I could
30:04 - do this on my it was like again that
30:06 - like kind of like uh naive kid that's
30:09 - just kind of like you know at the time
30:10 - I'm like 23 thinking I could probably do
30:13 - this I'm doing all the project
30:15 - management I'm doing the coding like
30:17 - working with the clients I'm like I kind
30:18 - of get this I kind of understand and I'm
30:20 - like I want to maybe work with different
30:21 - some different technology tools so I I
30:24 - quit that so I can do Planet earon
30:25 - full-time so that was uh early 2004 is
30:29 - when I officially was I'm out on my own
30:32 - um and to to to make plan argon work or
30:35 - not um the so here's what happens I'm
30:38 - doing that I'm you know trying to find
30:41 - work doing primarily PHP some Pearl a
30:45 - little bit of python work um and I was
30:48 - really excited about I think PHP 5 was
30:50 - coming at the time and it was going to
30:52 - introduce some more o related stuff into
30:54 - the language and I was like this is
30:55 - object fored yeah this is what I was uh
30:58 - kind of I was this is what I want to
31:00 - work with
31:02 - and and then I'm also I have a band I'm
31:04 - playing music at the time um and I was
31:07 - like I had been in a couple bands to
31:09 - this whole time as well it's another
31:10 - thread there but the I late 200 maybe
31:14 - like November 2004 I'm look I'm always
31:16 - looking for jobs on Craigslist because
31:18 - that's where you would find work a lot
31:19 - of time for like these Contracting
31:21 - projects so people would be looking for
31:22 - so i''d be scouring Craigslist in
31:24 - different major cities across the US
31:26 - people looking for like I I have this
31:28 - PHP website I need help you know and
31:30 - then I might get like you know 20 to a
31:32 - couple hundred hours worth of
31:33 - development work out of those contracts
31:34 - so I would just respond that's that's
31:36 - how I would def find work was like
31:37 - things through Craigslist and there
31:39 - might have been some other websites but
31:40 - that just one happens to be a top of
31:42 - mind and then one day in Portland there
31:45 - was an ad for this company that I was
31:48 - very well aware of called cdbaby.com oh
31:52 - yeah and Dereck sers yes so they were
31:56 - looking for a PHP developer here in
31:59 - Portland and I couldn't think of
32:01 - anything more perfectly aligned with
32:03 - like the DIY here's this person who
32:04 - started this business where it was
32:06 - helping independent musicians sell their
32:09 - CDs online because that's how you did it
32:11 - back then we you would literally like
32:13 - you make your CDs and you would send CD
32:16 - Baby a box of CDs and then they they
32:18 - would put you in their store and then
32:20 - they would handle the Fulfillment and
32:21 - the shipping and so they had a huge
32:23 - Warehouse you know maybe like four miles
32:26 - from where I live right now
32:28 - and I was like I knew that a lot of
32:29 - people worked there were musicians that
32:30 - worked in like the full field I'm like
32:32 - that sounds perfect I'll be a programmer
32:34 - I'll get to work with musicians I might
32:37 - make new bandmate friends or this might
32:39 - open up opportunities and maybe maybe
32:42 - open up doors for my music because I
32:44 - wanted to play music that that was
32:46 - really my dream was like I want to be
32:48 - like I want to make make it as a
32:49 - musician and yeah we haven't talked
32:51 - about that but it was like that was one
32:52 - of the creative Outlets that I really
32:54 - started to get into around that era of
32:56 - my life and
32:57 - so I emailed you know responded to this
33:00 - Craig stat and I applied for a job
33:02 - thinking I'll stop doing this Consulting
33:03 - work because I have to con I'm finding
33:05 - work all the time but like if I could
33:06 - work at CD Baby yeah I'll just stop
33:08 - doing this yeah so I didn't start
33:11 - planning thinking like oh it's going to
33:12 - become this thing I'm going to do for
33:15 - the next several decades it was like
33:16 - this is what I can do right now so I can
33:18 - get by pay myself but and maybe
33:21 - something interesting will pop up so I
33:22 - was so I applied you Derek quickly
33:25 - replied to me and he's like hey let's
33:28 - chat I he's like can I come to your
33:29 - house or come can I come to you and
33:31 - we'll have like a little kind of
33:33 - informal interview so we did that he he
33:35 - came over to my house one day like you
33:39 - know in the morning around probably
33:40 - around this time of the day and he had I
33:41 - remember he showed up with a he had
33:44 - stopped at maybe like Whole Foods or
33:45 - something and showed up with like a big
33:47 - little plastic container of pineapple
33:49 - and he was just eating pineapple 9:00 in
33:52 - the morning I a bunch of it and he's he
33:54 - was like I made some tea for him and we
33:56 - chatted for a couple couple hours about
33:57 - programming and kind of him getting to
33:59 - know a bit more about my background as
34:01 - as a software developer he's like oh
34:03 - this is interesting he's like I'm

34:06 - the next week I went out he had me over
34:07 - for another interview went out to their

34:11 - conversations and he essentially
34:13 - verbally offered me the job he's like
34:14 - great because here's the deal Derek at
34:17 - the time was the only developer that had
34:19 - ever worked on any of the code there he
34:20 - was looking for his first programming
34:22 - hire that would basically start to
34:24 - replace pretty important take over for
34:26 - some stuff yeah and to fix the you know
34:30 - invariably you know Hodge fge code base
34:33 - exactly and for this operation that was
34:36 - running really successful he's like I
34:38 - have to focus on other areas of the
34:39 - business now I can't be just head down

35:15 - what he's like so I got stuck in a
35:16 - blizzard um during the holiday break and
35:20 - I had this book called programming Ruby
35:22 - U it's a famous book in the programming
35:24 - world it's like it's a pi it's called
35:25 - the pickaxe because there's a pick like
35:27 - yeah the pi book and he's like I and
35:30 - there's this thing called Ruby on Rails
35:32 - I want to do it all in this I want to
35:34 - rewrite everything in this like I'm so
35:36 - excited about this I love rub like I'm
35:37 - so excited about Ruby I want to redo it
35:39 - he's like but you don't know Ruby yet
35:41 - I'm just learning it I found a guy that
35:42 - lives in San Diego that knows it's
35:44 - already on the court team this guy named
35:46 - Jeremy I'm moving to
35:48 - Portland to help me rewrite everything
35:51 - and so he said if you can pick this up
35:54 - I'll hire you then so
35:57 - so dream shattered take a moment being
36:00 - like okay that's it is what it is it's
36:02 - not the end of the world it's just like
36:04 - okay I get it I had also heard of Ruben
36:06 - ra about a month before i' watched the
36:08 - video there famous like video about like
36:10 - creating a Blog in like 15 minutes or
36:12 - something I was like oh that SS
36:12 - interesting so I was like all right I'm
36:14 - going to start playing with it and start
36:18 - like kind of getting into it I'm like
36:19 - kind of excited about it I'm like well
36:20 - and there's a carrot if I could pick
36:22 - this up and get good at it and
36:24 - understand enough like I'll go work with
36:26 - you know Derek and this guy named Jeremy
36:28 - you know in in northeast Portland at
36:31 - this warehouse and work in Ruby I'm like
36:33 - that great there's a job I I think
36:35 - there's a job here I could pick this up
36:38 - you know so I start diving in more Ruban
36:40 - rails and there's not a lot of
36:41 - documentation because it's new and I
36:43 - have to like figure out how to look
36:45 - under the hood and make make sense of
36:46 - things and so I started like
36:48 - well so that I can remember this I
36:50 - started a Blog I called it Robbie on
36:52 - Rails um and I started blogging very
36:55 - very regularly
36:57 - um and like modifying my own blog tool
36:59 - and I'm working on you like start
37:01 - teaching like showing like how I'm doing
37:03 - things I'm like I had started working on
37:04 - this one project um called my band spot
37:07 - which was like going to be a CMS for
37:09 - bands to manage their own websites
37:10 - because it was something that I had
37:11 - built in PHP for a couple of bands in
37:15 - Portland and I was like oh I'll rewrite
37:17 - this in Ruby and Ruby on Rails and then
37:19 - I can show Derek look I'm I'm I'm
37:21 - learning all this
37:22 - stuff anyhow that kind
37:25 - of Ruan rails that it's like hard to
37:28 - compare it to anything else they seen
37:31 - maybe and like AI has been its own
37:33 - interesting thing in the last years but
37:34 - I feel like with new technologies that
37:36 - come in and just like change the
37:39 - trajectory of like the community like so
37:41 - quickly Ruby on rounds at that time was
37:43 - just like it w it's it's hard to really
37:46 - explain but it
37:49 - was it it it just made our life so much
37:52 - better as a software as software
37:53 - developers
37:55 - that it basic B became this thing
37:57 - because I was blogging about it these
37:58 - startups started contacting me and being
38:00 - like hey will you work on our project
38:01 - for us can you help me build this thing
38:03 - because you apparently know about it
38:05 - because you're talking about it you know
38:06 - on your blog and so my Dynamic of me
38:11 - scouring Craigslist looking for PHP jobs
38:14 - and competing for like you know I'm
38:16 - trying to ask for like $50 $60 an hour
38:18 - and other people like well I pay this
38:20 - one person 15 can you can you meet me at
38:22 - 25 and I'm like yeah how much do I need
38:24 - to work this week um
38:27 - to all of a sudden people asking me hey
38:29 - can you will you work on our project
38:31 - with us I have this new startup idea and
38:33 - so that stuff started picking up more
38:34 - work like that people people were coming
38:37 - to me and I also part of it was like
38:40 - another thing because it wasn't just
38:41 - that I was just blogging Planet argon
38:44 - also because I was I always wanted to
38:46 - work with new versions of technology and
38:50 - and be able to host that easily I felt
38:51 - like a lot of cheap affordable
38:54 - hosting was always going to be like way
38:56 - behind on what version of PHP you could
38:58 - use so I remember when PHP 5 came out I
39:00 - offered shared hosting for PHP
39:03 - 5 people people that wanted so if you're
39:05 - a developer you could do that or you
39:06 - wanted to use the brand the latest
39:07 - version of postresql here's an
39:10 - environment that you could do that with
39:11 - and so you know a month and a half into
39:14 - me really diving into Ruby on Rails I
39:15 - started offering Ruby on Rails hosting
39:17 - to people and so I started getting
39:19 - interesting so it's just a server that
39:20 - was configured to already have a lot of
39:23 - that stuff running so you could like
39:24 - multi-tenant or whatever exactly
39:26 - Multiplex uh a lot of clients on the
39:28 - same machine yeah this was before we had
39:31 - like virtualization being like super
39:33 - common and things like Zen uh xn at the
39:36 - you know came a couple years later
39:38 - basically I just knew how to set up like
39:40 - there was some open source stuff for
39:41 - managing shared hosting with PHP stuff
39:44 - and I figured how to change it so that
39:46 - it could also like spin up a ruby
39:47 - environment for people so people could
39:50 - back then you would just include all of
39:51 - your you know your your gems as part of
39:54 - your repository like your subversion
39:55 - Repository or a c CVS or whatever you're
39:58 - using and so or you would SFTP your
40:01 - files into your this home directory that
40:03 - you had and like I just would everybody
40:06 - would have their own database running
40:08 - and and stuff like that so I just
40:09 - learned how to like I could fit like
40:11 - maybe know 80 to 100 customers per
40:14 - server um and because none of the
40:16 - projects were that big in terms of
40:18 - traffic like they could all kind of
40:19 - coexist and and it worked out okay um
40:22 - and then eventually if you wanted to
40:23 - spend more we would make you know we put
40:25 - you on servers ahe had less customers on
40:27 - it that you were sharing space with and
40:29 - that's that's how that model worked back
40:30 - then but that so I had those two things
40:32 - happening I was blogging and I was with
40:34 - the hosting stuff and then companies
40:36 - started contacting me to be like hey
40:37 - will you work on this project people
40:39 - also asking me hey would you interview
40:41 - for a company you know you mentioned
40:43 - like getting approached by you know
40:44 - opportunity so you know maybe fast
40:46 - forward four five six months um Derek
40:50 - from CD bab is like hey you want to chat
40:52 - again I'm like my my my my my situation
40:56 - had changed you know quite quite a bit I
40:58 - was like oh I'm actually I just got a
41:00 - book deal with O'Reilly um and be weird
41:04 - for him like you go from like some long
41:07 - shot like maybe this kid will actually
41:08 - learn it and to having like an
41:11 - authoritative book uh or blog and and a
41:15 - you know potential book deal with
41:16 - O'Reilly which you know at the time was
41:18 - basically the king makers yeah of the
41:21 - tech press essentially like if anybody
41:24 - was an expert like like having an Ry
41:26 - book meant you were like the definitive
41:29 - expert qualified to write on the topic
41:31 - what was what was going to be your
41:33 - animal you know on what's your animal
41:35 - cover uh did they let you choose by the
41:37 - way no um and and that's a whole another
41:40 - story but book never got finished
41:42 - because the company grew too quick and
41:45 - so that point I turned around the job I
41:48 - said Derek I'm like I'm going to see
41:49 - where this goes um and people were
41:52 - approaching me and maybe there was still
41:53 - kind OFA I didn't really have employees
41:55 - outside of it was me and and my kind of
41:58 - like my
41:59 - co-founder who uh who was starting to
42:02 - get more involved in some of the
42:03 - projects that we're working because
42:03 - there was a lot more design involved it'
42:05 - like start a project so we were she
42:06 - would design stuff and I would build
42:07 - stuff and so we were doing that and
42:10 - we're just being I was being very active
42:12 - in the community there was no Ruby there
42:14 - was no rails conferences or anything
42:16 - that that that was like a year later
42:17 - before those started and so it wasn't
42:20 - like speaking engagements outside of
42:21 - like the local so where was the
42:22 - community I mean it was people reading
42:24 - your blog were people like on IRC yes
42:27 - IRC yep was meeting lot of people
42:29 - through IRC because so people you know
42:32 - Planet argon had we had a IRC channel
42:34 - for for people that were hanging out
42:36 - because they were customers and they
42:37 - would all like help each other we had
42:39 - our forums we had there was the Ruby on
42:41 - Rails Channel um and then there became
42:44 - this kind of like little back channel in
42:46 - the rubyan rails Community um called The
42:49 - Caboose because it's kind of like the
42:50 - back of the train and we were kind of
42:51 - like the this became this like little
42:54 - hodge podge group of people that were
42:56 - were kind of early adopters through rean
42:57 - rails and kind of people that were maybe
42:59 - more
43:00 - [Music]
43:25 - businessyoutube
43:26 - exactly you know he's just you know he's
43:28 - working on you know selling snowboards
43:31 - on on you know on the internet and stuff
43:32 - like that and um so we were all like
43:35 - helping each other in this back Channel
43:36 - like kind of like basically it was just
43:38 - because it was just like a subset
43:39 - because the r on Rails channel would be
43:40 - like hundreds of people and this one
43:41 - made maybe be like 30 to 40 people
43:44 - there's a photo of us somewhere on
43:45 - Flickr like at the first rails comp in
43:48 - Chicago where everybody that was around
43:50 - for that photo like that was like a big
43:52 - group of the people and that was like
43:53 - the first time a lot of us got to meet
43:55 - each other in person um so it was just
43:57 - like that Community was definitely IRC
43:59 - based and blog based um we were all kind
44:02 - of like referencing each other's blogs
44:04 - we used that was back when we would have
44:06 - like a little list of other blogs you
44:09 - recommended people reading you know like
44:10 - I for what what we call that but kind of
44:12 - like a web ring typees thing and um and
44:18 - there was someone that um kind of you
44:21 - know looking back at that early that
44:22 - first one or two years of Ruban rails
44:24 - like someone was there was like a Ruban
44:25 - rails blog site it was kind of like an
44:27 - aggregator that kind of brought all
44:30 - these like blogs you bringing all the
44:31 - RSS feeds into one that was pretty
44:34 - popular it might have been like Planet
44:35 - Ruby and rails or something and at like
44:38 - after like a year there was some
44:39 - Milestone and and then they announced
44:41 - like who was the most prolific blogger
44:44 - in the ruband RS community and like I
44:46 - was like twice as many blog posts as
44:48 - anyone else that year wow and because I
44:50 - was just sharing what I learned as I did
44:51 - it and
44:53 - um and that so a lot of people knew me
44:56 - as Robbie on ra stuff like that so that
44:57 - opened up a lot of doors and then later
45:00 - in that year so this is like fall 2005
45:02 - this is when we grow couple large
45:05 - projects get come my way one of them is
45:07 - by a design company that had a project
45:09 - they were doing a winter Olympics
45:11 - project for this small shoe company
45:14 - that's based in um Oregon called Nike
45:17 - and they were their headquarters here
45:19 - and they were working on a couple
45:21 - projects for nanki one was the Winter
45:23 - Olympics and then there was also going
45:24 - to be a World Cup website and they
45:26 - wanted to build this backend system and
45:28 - they were like excited about using Ruban
45:30 - rails we were like the only people I was
45:33 - like one of the only
45:35 - people on the west coast that was like
45:37 - actively doing much Ruby on rail stuff
45:39 - at the time and I knew these people in
45:41 - their local Ruby user meet meetings that
45:44 - I would go to and I was like hey this
45:46 - project is too big for
45:48 - me can't do you want to come help me do
45:50 - this because most nobody was getting
45:52 - paid to work with not not very many
45:53 - people were getting paid in Portland to
45:56 - work on Ruby on Rails like they were
45:58 - curious about it or even to work on you
45:59 - know just program with Ruby in general
46:02 - but they like to dabble with it it was
46:03 - like they like their hobby thing you
46:05 - know they were getting paid to do like I
46:06 - remember so I ended up kind of
46:08 - recruiting maybe seven or eight people
46:11 - and they were working or like an office
46:13 - attic bought some like folding tables
46:15 - and some chairs from used furniture
46:17 - equip like office furniture um store and
46:21 - all of a sudden it was like eight eight
46:22 - people working in the Attic on these
46:24 - projects and I was like I don't know
46:25 - what happening but I'm like let's just
46:27 - see where this goes in worst case um
46:30 - this doesn't work out for more more than
46:32 - a few months then I just go back to
46:33 - working for myself or I'll just go talk
46:35 - to these companies that keep wanting to
46:36 - maybe hire me so that's when we became
46:40 - an agency was it was it was very quick
46:43 - it was a big project so so you had eight
46:45 - devs yeah like basically like and then
46:49 - did you feel pressure to go out and
46:50 - pound the ground and get business to be
46:52 - able to support those devs well at the
46:55 - time I was turning away
46:57 - work wow so you you could literally put
47:00 - all eight of those devs productively to
47:03 - were were yeah they were they were going
47:05 - to be busy for the next few months
47:06 - because there was a couple projects I
47:07 - mentioned those Nike ones there was this
47:09 - other startup um and I remember I our
47:11 - estimate for that yeah I mean Nike like
47:14 - maybe the biggest Portland company yeah
47:17 - um to get them as a client early on
47:19 - that's that's definitely a feather in
47:20 - your cap well we were subcontracted
47:22 - through a designer to be clear Nike I do
47:25 - not think they would have hired us
47:26 - directly um we were probably way too
47:28 - small they did later we did work with
47:29 - Nike for many many actually still kind
47:31 - of work with them now but um we're
47:33 - almost wind it down with them but we we
47:35 - Nike was one of our was been one of our
47:37 - largest clients over the years so um
47:40 - eventually we were mature enough of a
47:42 - company for them to take seriously but
47:44 - the um but yeah during that period it
47:46 - was like we had enough work for people
47:48 - so they were basically hir them all as
47:50 - contractors um in like maybe October
47:54 - November that year and then and then
47:57 - towards the end of the year we're like
47:58 - all right well let's let's take a real
48:00 - look at like it was a so proprietorship
48:02 - at that point so the business model like
48:05 - the entity so so you had liability yeah
48:08 - so January 1st 2006 we became an LLC and
48:12 - then I offered all those people jobs
48:14 - employment jobs and most of them took a
48:16 - job that meant that they were going to
48:17 - get to work with Ruban rails and that's
48:19 - what they were in Ruby and that was
48:21 - exciting and there was basically just
48:23 - the people that I knew locally that were
48:25 - excited about it I didn't it wasn't I
48:28 - don't
48:29 - remember any any other way of thinking
48:31 - about how to weigh them up if they were
48:33 - going to be good people to work with if
48:34 - they were uh good employees so the
48:37 - interview process was like kind of
48:39 - non-existent because you just already
48:40 - knew them yeah I just met you know I met
48:43 - them a couple times at like the the
48:44 - local Ruby Meetup maybe we we you maybe
48:48 - we got a you know coffee or had lunches
48:51 - together um maybe grab a drink or
48:53 - something and I was like I'm just going
48:55 - to throw these this rag tag group of
48:58 - kids at the I want say kids but we're
49:00 - all like in our you know probably mid
49:02 - 20s at the time I was like let's just I
49:06 - just let's just see what happens and
49:07 - worst thing as I go back to doing we all
49:09 - go back to what we were doing right yeah
49:12 - and the thing that I
49:13 - knew I felt like I had some at least a
49:16 - skill set was because I had already had
49:18 - a couple you know years of doing the
49:20 - Consulting work that I knew how to at
49:21 - least like do a little bit of
49:23 - negotiating I knew how to do think about
49:24 - the sales process and knew that I needed
49:26 - to spend time on marketing and promoting
49:30 - the company and reconnecting with
49:32 - customers after you wrap up a small
49:34 - project like a few months later to see
49:36 - what else is going on so you can get
49:37 - recurring work with you know like I that
49:39 - was so so maintaining that relationship
49:42 - and and having it not be a oneoff but uh
49:44 - you know a an iterated game so to speak
49:48 - exactly and the and meanwhile I felt
49:50 - like a lot of the software Engineers
49:52 - that had been experienced with they just
49:53 - wanted to work on the code and they were
49:54 - really excited about the tech itself and
49:57 - I think back to what you were you know
49:58 - we were talking about earlier in the
49:59 - conversation where I was interested in
50:01 - what it could do for a company so I was
50:03 - like I felt like I was in a much more
50:05 - natural I mean I was super excited about
50:07 - playing with Ruan rails and everything
50:09 - but I was like what can I do with this
50:11 - what kind of web apps can I make for
50:13 - people what kind of business problems
50:15 - can I solve look how much quicker we can
50:16 - build this thing for these people and it
50:19 - was also an overlap at the time with
50:21 - like a lot of like web design and ux
50:25 - improve improvements in maturity I think
50:26 - in the industry where there was like a
50:28 - lot of patterns you can pull from web
50:30 - standards browser you know things that
50:33 - were happening it's just like a web
50:35 - standards being as that was like its own
50:37 - thing the fact that we were even geeking
50:39 - out about like HTML and CSS consistency
50:42 - as a industry was like that overlapped
50:44 - at like at just the right time that it
50:47 - just made I think Ruby on Rails came in
50:49 - and so all new web apps could use these
50:51 - new patterns and so they looked and felt
50:53 - better and for users and so like I feel
50:57 - like it kind of just all got bundled up
50:59 - into that thing like oh rubben Ra's
51:00 - applications feel better because you're
51:03 - using all these new standards and so
51:05 - there was kind of this weird thing where
51:07 - like because you're using these new
51:08 - standards you care about the end users
51:10 - and that's going to make better for your
51:12 - business and and look how much nicer
51:14 - things are yeah versus these clunky web
51:17 - apps that everybody would be throwing
51:18 - together because it' be a bunch of
51:19 - software web
51:21 - developers designing the interfaces
51:23 - quite often and they were just like they
51:25 - weren't great they were just making it
51:27 - you know doing their best and they
51:29 - weren't really thinking about the design
51:30 - side yeah and I think bootstrap came out
51:33 - like shortly afterward and was pretty
51:35 - widely adopted by the r on Rails
51:37 - Community as well and that that kind of
51:40 - standardized and removed a lot of the
51:42 - decisions that you had to make as a
51:45 - developer um yeah and that's like really
51:48 - the strength of rails in my humble
51:50 - opinion is the convention over
51:51 - configuration um just like this works
51:53 - well enough let's not split hairs and so
51:57 - while a lot of people might have been
51:58 - like um you know saying oh rails is not
52:01 - high performance or enough or I needed
52:03 - to do specifically this
52:04 - thing you were just getting down to work
52:07 - building stuff for clients exactly it
52:10 - was just I I you know it was a little
52:13 - bit of a David Goliath battle too back
52:16 - then it was kind of like look this is
52:18 - kind of Underdog thing we're like coming
52:20 - through and we're like no we can build
52:22 - really sophisticated applications with
52:24 - this technology that people were
52:26 - like skeptical to say the least like
52:29 - this isn't mature it's funny because now
52:32 - you know 20 years later or whatever uh
52:35 - it's I feel like we're having similar
52:36 - conversations like oh ruon RS is like
52:38 - this old thing nobody wants to use it
52:40 - anymore it's too mature too mature and
52:43 - like we go back to when I used to have I
52:46 - used to have to have conversations with
52:47 - large companies that like someone at
52:49 - their company had heard of rubben like I
52:51 - really want I'm they were like really
52:53 - proponed like we want to build this web
52:54 - app for this internal thing but I need
52:57 - you to help me convince the CTO that
53:00 - this is a safe decision this is not
53:02 - going to like ruin us somehow or going
53:05 - to plague us with security things or
53:07 - just we're going have to throw so much
53:08 - Hardware to keep this thing running I
53:11 - mean were you doing a lot of like full
53:13 - codebase rewrites like Dereck sers was
53:15 - asking or were you just building new
53:16 - functionality out with rails a lot of it
53:18 - at the time early on was new
53:20 - functionality new web apps um and the I
53:25 - think it probably took about a year and
53:27 - a half two years before we started
53:28 - getting calls from companies to help
53:30 - them come in and repair their existing
53:33 - Ruban rounds applications but there
53:35 - there was a couple projects that were
53:37 - were rewrites or kind of modernizing
53:40 - their existing platform a bit so like
53:43 - maybe there's a part of some web app
53:45 - that they were using like hey we want to
53:46 - put we want to build a new interface for
53:49 - like there was a company that worked in
53:50 - travel and they wanted to build a new
53:51 - interface for travel agents um that
53:54 - could interface with the same database
53:56 - so one of the things that I was kind of
53:59 - you know air quoting known for in the
54:01 - community was being a big post rescue y
54:04 - person but also being understanding that
54:06 - there's a lot of Legacy I came from a
54:08 - world where remember I mentioned earlier
54:10 - my previous job I was working at a
54:12 - company where we specialized in post and
54:14 - I I had a the database to me was like
54:17 - always like this thing that never assume
54:20 - that you're not going to have you're
54:21 - only going to have one application that
54:23 - interfaces with that you may have
54:24 - multiple things that are interacting
54:25 - with it so I always felt like a lot of
54:26 - business rules should be in the database
54:28 - which was like a hard Paradigm for me to
54:30 - wrap my head around when I got kind of
54:32 - adopted Ruby on Rails for yeah because
54:34 - you're doing like migrations in code
54:36 - essentially as opposed to structuring
54:38 - your database in a specific way and then
54:41 - adapting your apps around that existing
54:43 - kind of schema right yeah well
54:46 - technically uh database migrations
54:48 - didn't exist in rubs when I started
54:50 - using RS uh you saw you all of our first
54:53 - scheme is you had to do all your write
54:55 - out your SQL create table statements
54:57 - alra table statements that came in maybe
54:59 - a year two years into rubian rails after
55:02 - I started using it and I think probably
55:05 - help I don't remember if they adopted
55:06 - that from somewhere else but it was
55:07 - definitely like a big game changer but
55:09 - it was more of the you already have a
55:11 - legacy database that has some different
55:13 - application how can we make a ruon rails
55:15 - application work with that same data set
55:17 - and make maybe new reporting tools or
55:19 - some new interfaces on it so I was
55:21 - writing a lot of I wrote a lot of
55:23 - articles in some Library ruby gems that
55:25 - were for like working with Legacy
55:27 - databases so you can put active record
55:30 - and have it connect to some um like
55:32 - Microsoft SQL Server thing or an Oracle
55:34 - database or some old MySQL plus database
55:37 - where the DAT the naming conventions are
55:39 - wildly not what we would consider normal
55:42 - in the Ruban rails Community just like a
55:44 - different way of doing it so so but then
55:46 - you can make it feel more rails likee
55:48 - and so get the benefits of building web
55:50 - apps quickly with rbrand rounds but
55:52 - still getting to leaning on an existing
55:53 - database and having to work around
55:55 - database triggers or store procedures
55:57 - and how do you make that work within the
56:00 - rub rub Ruban rails world and so that
56:03 - was like a part of my I guess my Niche
56:05 - was because I had that skill set and I
56:06 - was like how do I work around and still
56:08 - get to use and leverage ruon rails um so
56:12 - we would get pulled in to help out with
56:13 - companies that were trying
56:15 - to have like a hybrid system there's a
56:17 - lot of companies sneaking rails in on
56:19 - this very small thing and and like their
56:21 - dream would be like and then eventually
56:23 - we'll show that this works like a trojan
56:24 - horse
56:25 - eventually the whole comp going to Mo
56:27 - rails but we have to prove out the
56:29 - concept with this exactly so that there
56:32 - was a lot of like that type of work that
56:33 - came kind of came our way as well and
56:35 - then over the years we ended up
56:37 - realizing that a lot of our typical
56:39 - clients that were startups they would
56:41 - not be our clients you know two years
56:43 - down the road because they didn't figure
56:45 - out how to make their startup work right
56:48 - and so most startups do not uh get
56:51 - product Market fit they don't get
56:52 - traction and they are not able able to
56:55 - raise subsequent rounds um yeah yeah but
56:59 - but obviously Planet argon from a
57:02 - sustainability standpoint is is going
57:04 - strong I mean you're like almost 22
57:07 - years in at this point uh how big is
57:10 - your team now we are I think
57:12 - approximately 14 15 people at the moment
57:16 - um it's funny like every time I get
57:18 - asked that question I don't exactly know
57:20 - I have to look at the slack Channel um
57:22 - it's always like kind of weaving in we
57:24 - do bring on contractors here and there
57:25 - as well we've usually got a couple
57:27 - interns um so that numbers in terms of
57:29 - working directly with with clients and
57:31 - like I guess selling the clients is that
57:33 - something you do a lot of yourself still
57:36 - yeah I do a lot of the business
57:38 - development at the company so I'm
57:40 - usually one of the first for people that
57:42 - companies will talk to and kind of like
57:44 - help make sure it's a good fit for the
57:45 - company we're not like a large enough
57:47 - company to really have in it's
57:49 - interesting people always talk we invest
57:51 - in like we have a marketing person that
57:52 - helps out with our marketing but when it
57:54 - comes to Sal sales uh there's this
57:57 - interesting thing because the type of
57:58 - work that we focus on now is more on
58:01 - helping organizations that have already
58:03 - invested a lot into their rubyan rails
58:05 - infrastructure and platform how to help
58:07 - them modernize that how to help them
58:10 - like do some refactoring projects or we
58:12 - are their primary development team
58:14 - because there's a lot of web web apps
58:16 - out there where a company might have had
58:18 - a small development team internally
58:21 - build or maybe they worked with a small
58:22 - agency or a couple of Freelancers to
58:24 - build some internal tool but it wasn't
58:26 - like a it was never intended to be a
58:27 - thing that they were going to have
58:29 - consistent full-time software Engineers
58:31 - working on they don't and they're not
58:33 - really set up like they're you know it's
58:35 - you know they're a travel company and
58:37 - they're like what we don't know what to
58:39 - we don't know how we would keep like two
58:41 - three software developers busy fulltime
58:44 - right so they have these apps that need
58:45 - support and but they need more
58:47 - reliability than say just working with a
58:49 - freelancer and so we're kind of like in
58:51 - this space of like you maybe for aside
58:54 - from the companies that have their own
58:55 - engineering teams that use us to help
58:57 - them with make some upgrades and
58:58 - modernization type projects or
59:00 - refactoring uh we're kind of in this
59:02 - interesting middle sphere of like where
59:05 - when you outgrow like your Freelancers
59:08 - but you're not really thinking you want
59:10 - to grow into having your own full-time
59:11 - team we end up being so so a lot of our
59:14 - companies were on regular retainer with
59:16 - them where they are basically reserving
59:17 - time with us every month for us to keep
59:20 - an eye on their application to respond
59:21 - to bug fixes error alerts performance
59:24 - issues
59:25 - and they always have a backlog of
59:27 - feature improvements and updates that
59:28 - they're looking to make and so we're
59:30 - we're their team you know and so we so
59:33 - our our developers are working across
59:35 - multiple clients like in a given week so
59:37 - it's a little bit Contex switching but
59:38 - they're all it's all ruby and rounds for
59:39 - the most part and so we're just like so
59:43 - our business model kind of went from
59:45 - working with startups and helping them
59:47 - estimate out their you know their
59:48 - product Market fit and hoping that they
59:51 - figure out how to sell this thing and so
59:53 - that they can get more budget in the
59:55 - future to keep investing to now we're
59:58 - like hey you already invested in this
60:01 - thing you know you need to continue
60:02 - investing in the upkeep of it and keep
60:04 - things updated and um and we're not
60:06 - afraid to roll our hands you know or or
60:08 - roll our sleeves up and get dirty on
60:10 - older applications because a lot of
60:12 - projects come to us and they have not
60:13 - been tended to um in years because
60:16 - they're like well we had a couple people
60:17 - work on it and then that person left and
60:19 - then someone came in and they never
60:21 - upgraded it and now 5 years has passed
60:23 - but we you but 30 people at our company
60:25 - use this application every day we need
60:27 - to know that someone can take care of it
60:29 - so since we've been around forever we've
60:31 - seen all flavors of that over the years
60:33 - and so we can come in be like yeah we
60:34 - can stabilize this and work on a plan to
60:36 - help you upgrade this and interesting so
60:38 - so a big selling point of uh getting
60:42 - Planet argon to work on your uh your
60:44 - code base it sounds like first of all
60:48 - you've been around you're not going
60:49 - anywhere so there's that peace of mind
60:51 - associated with like Hey we're going to
60:53 - get these people up to speed on how our
60:55 - code works and they're going to be able
60:56 - to continue to maintain it uh for a
60:58 - longer period of time and it's not like
61:00 - a freelancer where they're going to um
61:02 - move or um just change careers or
61:05 - something like that like that a lot of
61:07 - that risk is mitigated and at the same
61:09 - time it is a lot less expensive than
61:11 - having your
61:13 - own you know developer staff just
61:16 - maintaining that project and and in in
61:17 - many cases sounds like a lot of these uh
61:19 - particular projects are not such that
61:23 - they would warrant having
61:25 - uh a bigger team no and and I think I
61:28 - think some companies fall into a trap
61:29 - where I've speak with some developers
61:32 - like yeah I'm like the solo
61:34 - developer on this project for this
61:36 - company and I've been working here for a
61:37 - decade and maybe five years ago they had
61:40 - a cooworker another developer they have
61:42 - they have co-workers but there's like
61:44 - but like a peer you know what I mean and
61:46 - like I can't kind of see where you're go
61:47 - is this is the tacit knowledge Time Bomb
61:49 - basically like they walk out the door
61:51 - and like suddenly nobody knows how
61:53 - anything works exactly
61:55 - this this story is like one of the most
61:57 - consistent thing this is where this is
61:59 - another one of the so it's interesting
62:01 - I'm actually helping a company right now
62:03 - and
62:03 - so I'm kind of like in a weird way I get
62:07 - one of our service offering is kind of
62:08 - like it's you know Under the Umbrella we
62:10 - do Consulting right as well and but a
62:12 - little bit of was
62:14 - like um like business I want to say
62:18 - family therapy for teams of like you
62:21 - know I will you know it's it's it's
62:23 - almost guaranteed that always like once
62:24 - every 6 months I'm going to get a com
62:26 - we're going to get a call from some
62:28 - someone that works at a company that
62:30 - maybe has 20 to 50 employees and they
62:33 - have one software engineer that's been
62:34 - there for a really long time and they're
62:36 - like hey we have a situation we've
62:39 - either there's enough work that we tried
62:41 - to bring in additional people and people
62:43 - leave and they cannot work with this
62:45 - person that's been around forever and
62:46 - this is right they come in and they're
62:47 - like great I'm going to come in and be
62:49 - some you know New Blood on the project
62:51 - and a year year and a half later they
62:52 - quit and they're like I can't work with
62:54 - that person um but then they're like but
62:57 - that this person has been so dependable
62:58 - for us over the years and we're really
63:00 - nervous about losing this person but but
63:02 - maybe it's time for them to go you know
63:05 - and they're in this weird situation
63:07 - like can you come and help us assess
63:10 - this like can interesting so almost kind
63:12 - of like U you're you're doing like a uh
63:16 - like a case like a a briefing you're
63:19 - you're going in as the investigator to
63:20 - like try to understand the situation and
63:22 - recommend courses of action
63:25 - yeah or just like can they help them
63:28 - understand can we survive if this person
63:31 - were to leave you know there's always
63:33 - like people talk about like oh what what
63:35 - happens if someone gets hit by a bus you
63:36 - know why we document things and this is
63:39 - why documentation is important and or
63:41 - why we re reate automated tests so that
63:43 - we know that if someone new comes in
63:45 - they know that they're not breaking
63:46 - everything well that sounds great but
63:48 - also when you're a really small team the
63:50 - reality is if no one's reading your
63:52 - documentation and you you're able to
63:53 - keep a lot in your head you start you
63:57 - start making concessions on what things
63:58 - like things that might help a healthy
64:00 - development team work and flourish you
64:03 - like well you deprioritize some stuff
64:05 - and you continue to do that and then
64:07 - people come in and they're like Hey
64:08 - where's the documentation like
64:10 - well you know I've changed this thing
64:12 - six times and no one's ever looked at it
64:13 - so I just I haven't maintained it in
64:15 - Forever you know like the read me file
64:17 - hasn't changed in five years and you're
64:19 - just like okay I get it I can be
64:21 - empathetic to that I understand how that
64:23 - happens when you're working in an
64:24 - environment where you're putting out
64:26 - fires you're being reactive to like hey
64:28 - you're keeping everything running and
64:30 - you're like kind of like thinking about
64:32 - someone spinning a bunch of plates at
64:33 - the same time you know and it could be a
64:36 - lot of work for one person to oversee
64:38 - the whole system but if there's no one
64:40 - to collaborate with consistently whether
64:41 - it's because of you're doing because
64:43 - you're just not great to work with or
64:45 - because you don't trust that other
64:46 - people are worthy of being part of your
64:49 - team whatever this situation is um or
64:52 - there's just not enough budget to
64:53 - warrant mult multiple people to be to
64:55 - work with you uh which ends up being
64:57 - quite a common thing you know this this
64:59 - kind of problem will resurface and so
65:01 - then the companies like what have we
65:02 - invested in or we screwed if this person
65:04 - walks out the door but also maybe they
65:06 - need to leave they need to leave and so
65:09 - for whatever reason I think I can come
65:11 - into those situations and and be fairly
65:14 - neutral I understand how the developer
65:16 - gets there I understand how the comp or
65:18 - the business owner might be really
65:20 - concerned about this and I can like I
65:22 - can talk with these people and kind of
65:23 - Na you're kind of like the Rockstar
65:25 - Whisperer almost a little bit but you
65:28 - know I'm trying to not use the Rockstar
65:30 - thing too much uh they usually just come
65:32 - in in like trash hotels and leave and um
65:35 - but it is it's it's an interesting like
65:37 - come in and maybe I have
65:40 - enough I'm well known enough in some
65:43 - circles that people give me a benefit of
65:45 - the doubt that I'm not coming in and
65:47 - just like telling someone what they want
65:48 - to hear so I mean do do people see you
65:51 - and like panic because like oh no no
65:54 - they they brought him and that must mean
65:55 - I'm like on my way out or no or like are
65:58 - you often able to like repair the
65:59 - situation or or just by introducing a
66:02 - collaboratory like discourse are you
66:05 - able to fix a lot of the uh kind of like
66:08 - documentation not getting updated tests
66:09 - not getting written things like
66:12 - that it's a great question the I've had
66:15 - some successes I've had I'd say the
66:17 - companies have had some failures with
66:19 - trying to correct the situation and
66:21 - where where it works out for everybody
66:23 - it doesn't always end up working out for
66:24 - everybody in some of those situ and I
66:26 - don't I do not believe I have a
66:27 - reputation coming in and like help
66:28 - helping people lose their jobs um I
66:30 - think I'm much more on this side of
66:32 - probably much more on the side of like
66:34 - helping people keep their jobs and maybe
66:36 - making some incremental changes but the
66:37 - people have you know it's like a it's in
66:40 - some ways it's like getting pulled in
66:41 - for like a you know like a
66:44 - physical therapist you go in and like
66:46 - try to get some work done and they show
66:48 - you all things you're like oh great I do
66:49 - these stretches every day this will be
66:51 - good for me and this will this pain will
66:52 - go away you know and I know that if you
66:54 - don't do the work consistently then
66:58 - you're just going to end up at the you
67:00 - know the physical therapist in five
67:01 - years and they're going to like you're
67:02 - like oh yeah I remember I did this
67:03 - before so there is a lot of like people
67:07 - need to want to change some of how their
67:09 - approach their work and stuff like that
67:11 - and so that's that's the thing I'm you
67:12 - know I've been you know coincidentally
67:14 - in the last couple years things that
67:15 - I've been doing is first professional
67:17 - development is taking a lot more
67:19 - curriculum related to improving my
67:21 - coaching skills like okay I'm I'm a
67:24 - coaching these situations how do I
67:26 - better talk with these people get them
67:29 - to think about their and help them solve
67:30 - their own problems rather than me being
67:31 - super prescriptive and like I think you
67:33 - should do it because this is what planet
67:34 - argon does and if you just do this it'll
67:36 - be great for you everybody kind of needs
67:37 - to figure out come to some of those aha
67:38 - moments themselves right um and which I
67:42 - think was also an important thing to
67:43 - learn early on as a consultant
67:45 - especially for designers that if you I
67:48 - always felt we always when we've had
67:49 - designers on our team if they work on
67:52 - working with a client on a design I
67:55 - honestly believe that I've seen way more
67:57 - success if the if the through that
68:00 - collaborative process of a designer
68:01 - working on things that if the designer
68:03 - can help the client feel
68:05 - like show them how their ideas is what
68:08 - manifested the current version of the
68:10 - design versus like a designer going away
68:13 - and coming up back with some magical
68:15 - representation of what they thought they
68:16 - heard the designers that always felt
68:19 - like made it
68:21 - appear that it was actually so much of
68:23 - the client's idea and they just
68:25 - materialized it like that's to me like
68:27 - an effective consultant effective coach
68:30 - is like helping someone see come to this
68:33 - kind of like realization and kind of
68:35 - coaching them that way and and also
68:37 - being aware enough to like that you
68:39 - might not know the best answer and you
68:40 - got to find something that's going to
68:41 - work well for them I'm not saying you're
68:43 - manipulating them but I think it's more
68:44 - of a there's a there's a strategy there
68:46 - I think that can be yield better results
68:49 - collectively so the um so when in these
68:52 - scenarios around coming in and helping
68:54 - helping out things it's a lot of like a
68:56 - strategy that we'll kind of take on um
68:58 - is doing this right now for one company
69:01 - where you know I'm participating sitting
69:02 - in a lot of their meetings and taking
69:04 - notes asking questions asking the dumb
69:06 - questions I always like let me ask a
69:07 - dumb question I said that if you say
69:09 - that like a bunch people disarms people
69:11 - pretty quickly I think um because then
69:13 - you can ask the questions you really
69:14 - want to ask but um and not have to rely
69:17 - on assumptions but like start thinking
69:19 - about like if you if we come in like
69:22 - show them that we're going to use the
69:24 - documentation like hey we want to like
69:25 - one exercise will be we want one of our
69:28 - developers to get your app up and
69:30 - running in their local environment um
69:32 - and like maybe a goal would be how hard
69:35 - is it to bring in someone else to come
69:37 - into your
69:38 - team get acclimated to your system your
69:41 - repo or multiple repos and be able to
69:44 - deploy a small bug fix maybe even just
69:46 - change the footer copyright date or
69:48 - something on your on your web app how
69:50 - painful is it for a company for for
69:52 - someone to come in and do that that
69:54 - because I feel like changing the date in
69:56 - the
69:57 - footer if that takes several days to be
69:59 - able to get to that point like is that
70:02 - unless you're bringing on regular people
70:03 - maybe that maybe not be the biggest
70:04 - concern but if you're a company that's
70:06 - concerned about like hey feels like
70:08 - everything's slowing down I feel like
70:10 - those are like sometimes symptom of that
70:13 - and like you can look at those types of
70:14 - how hard is it to do some really small
70:16 - tasks and people can come in and so I
70:19 - think if you can start removing like
70:21 - addressing those things you start to
70:23 - highlight a bunch of of other pain
70:24 - points that makes it difficult for
70:26 - people to come in because a lot of those
70:27 - companies that are calling us they're
70:28 - not just calling us because they're like
70:30 - hey help us better understand the
70:32 - situation they are truly calling us
70:35 - because they're like hey things have you
70:37 - know like our product backlog seems Log
70:39 - Jam things like our delivery time is
70:41 - taking forever I I'm starting to lose
70:43 - confidence in my team's ability to
70:46 - estimate when we can release something
70:48 - so that means I can't promise our
70:49 - customers that this new feature is going
70:51 - to be out by X because I just don't
70:52 - believe it anymore because it's like
70:54 - we're almost there we're almost there
70:55 - and then like months pass and they're
70:57 - like can you come in and like can we
70:59 - hire your team to come in and help us
71:00 - build these things but they're like they
71:02 - also know they like I don't think it's
71:03 - going to be that easy they know like you
71:05 - can't just throw more people at the
71:07 - problem it's like how do what's going on
71:09 - here what can we do to smooth the
71:11 - process and onboard new people so that
71:14 - other people can contribute to this
71:16 - project and I think if you have a piece
71:17 - of software regardless of the framework
71:19 - you're using if if it's difficult for
71:21 - other people to come in and work on it I
71:24 - honestly think that that's not a a good
71:26 - good sign that you have a great software
71:27 - developer I feel like that means you
71:29 - have a developer that's keeps everything
71:31 - in their head and that's that's not it's
71:34 - not it's not the end of the world
71:36 - especially if they're like in personally
71:38 - invested in their company but if they're
71:39 - an employee and you don't really feel
71:41 - like you can trust someone else to come
71:43 - in and take over for them yeah that's
71:45 - that's a concern to me and I always I
71:48 - remember thinking I remember we had a
71:50 - project manager once who was so
71:52 - organized with how they Pro like their
71:54 - process it was so consistent and how
71:56 - they documented everything they did I
71:58 - was like you're making it so easy for
71:59 - someone else to come in and just take
72:01 - over your job and they're like and
72:03 - that's why you keep me and I was like
72:07 - aha that's great that's a great it's
72:10 - it's very much counter to the intuition
72:12 - that a lot of developers have like by
72:14 - not documenting things like I've got all
72:16 - this proprietary knowledge in my head
72:18 - and uh it's my uh I guess my retirement
72:22 - plan is is like carrying around a whole
72:24 - bunch of details about the code base and
72:27 - uh and not you know writing those down
72:28 - anywhere that's my job security so so
72:31 - you you found it to be the opposite like
72:33 - companies will actually acknowledge like
72:35 - oh because this person is so transparent
72:37 - with everything that's a that's a
72:39 - strength it it should be seen as a
72:42 - strength it should be seen as a strength
72:43 - but is it seen as a strength by a lot of
72:45 - managers or do a lot of managers be like
72:47 - oh well we can replace this this person
72:50 - really easily with like a you know a
72:52 - cheaper developer just out of college
72:53 - because they've documented exactly what
72:55 - they need to do does that kind of
72:57 - transparency hurt your longevity at an
73:00 - organization to some
73:01 - extent that's a that's an interesting
73:04 - one I you know I was speaking with
73:06 - someone
73:08 - recently uh because one of the things we
73:10 - also offer now is recruiting uh as
73:12 - helping companies hire people because I
73:14 - know a lot of people in the industry
73:16 - that may have jobs that they like but
73:18 - would be open to talking to someone and
73:19 - so I'm like I am pretty well connected I
73:21 - can try to connect the dots and maybe I
73:22 - can make a little bit money on that
73:24 - introduction but aside from that um I
73:26 - talk with some people and they're like I
73:28 - got asked what's your opinion on uh how
73:31 - long like a 10 year how long of a 10e
73:33 - developer should have at a company and
73:36 - they had and this was from a like a
73:38 - pretty seasoned software
73:39 - engineer um that's been at a company for
73:42 - maybe like five years as a engineering
73:45 - manager he's like a he manages a team
73:48 - and he he's heard from other people in
73:49 - the company so he's in Engineering
73:50 - Management but he's heard from other
73:52 - parts of the business leadership that
73:55 - there's a curiosity about how long
73:57 - should we keep developers because if
73:59 - we're not cycling in new people and
74:01 - getting new fresh ideas one we might be
74:03 - getting stagnant but two um May maybe
74:07 - there's a competitive thing with
74:08 - salaries you know maybe we can hire
74:09 - people further away or whatever and
74:11 - there's other things there but like so
74:13 - he's like he's like he's like have you
74:14 - heard a lot about that so admittedly I
74:15 - don't feel like I've had a lot of
74:16 - conversations like about that that that
74:18 - was a recent conversation I had and I
74:20 - was like oh that's interesting because
74:21 - I've always think it's be great to have
74:23 - say for a long time but sometimes I do
74:24 - think from like a growth perspective if
74:26 - you depending what people's if you as a
74:29 - software let's just assume most people
74:30 - listen to this or software Engineers is
74:33 - your goal to be at a company for a
74:34 - really long time or is your can build
74:36 - like a longevity and like have uh make a
74:39 - mark for a specific organization that I
74:41 - mean I come from a maybe you know a
74:43 - couple you know a slightly different
74:44 - area where like the idea of working at a
74:47 - company for a long time actually sounded
74:49 - good to me when I was young I'm like oh
74:51 - I don't want to have to switch jobs all
74:52 - the time and like like hopefully I'm not
74:54 - like losing my job or getting laid off
74:56 - on a regular you know every five years
74:58 - like that I think that maybe in some
75:00 - ways me thinking I'm going to do my own
75:01 - thing was a way to avoid that because he
75:04 - would see that play out and still my dad
75:06 - worked at his last job for like 25 years
75:09 - you know yeah what about your
75:11 - grandpa he check he that's a good
75:13 - question I don't I don't know how I
75:16 - think he actually did a lot more job
75:17 - hopping because it was early on when
75:19 - like he was like he at least he moved a
75:22 - lot like the family moved for work a lot
75:25 - and so I don't know if that was like
75:26 - maybe the manager he worked more in like
75:28 - management maybe that was the manage
75:30 - track in the you know the 60s of moving
75:33 - like they go to their Minnesota then
75:36 - they moved to Illinois and then they
75:38 - moved to California yeah I mean I
75:42 - definitely have heard from older folks
75:45 - uh you know my grandpa stayed at the
75:48 - same company basically his entire career
75:50 - as an engineer um you know my dad has
75:53 - run his own practice with like similar
75:56 - partners for right most of his career uh
75:59 - it's it's
76:00 - pretty um common for like people from
76:05 - that they were born in like the the 40s
76:07 - 50s 60s to just stay at a place assuming
76:11 - that they can get a good job and like
76:13 - this definitely holds true in Asia for
76:15 - example in Japan like they have the
76:17 - whole company man notion like you get a
76:20 - job at a company and and ideally you
76:22 - stay and there's like the social
76:23 - contract where they teach you new skills
76:25 - and you keep getting promoted and
76:27 - additional
76:29 - responsibility how do you feel about
76:31 - that like do you think that that is a
76:33 - good fit for most developers that you
76:35 - know or do you think most developers do
76:36 - want to be changing a lot
76:40 - uh I I wonder if it's
76:44 - a I don't you know it's such an
76:46 - interesting thing I think you know for
76:48 - me you know I've been doing working at
76:50 - plan Aram for such a long time now you
76:52 - know like it's funny plus years and I'm
76:53 - like there's a part of me like is this
76:55 - where I retire I don't know the answer
76:56 - to that I don't know like do I still
76:58 - have a business in five years is always
77:00 - running a Consul consultancy is a
77:02 - complex mess of like es and flows and
77:05 - hiring people having to lay people off
77:07 - if there's down ears and stuff like that
77:08 - it's it's just a cycle and then but but
77:11 - at least I get to kind of control the
77:13 - narrative to some degree at least I feel
77:15 - like I'm slightly in control at times
77:17 - most of the time not but you know I
77:18 - think about when people are work for the
77:20 - general software engineering like if
77:22 - you're
77:25 - I'm just wondering if there's a certain
77:26 - element of like do
77:29 - you I I wonder how it's going to impact
77:32 - us when we're for for people that are in
77:36 - the industry and are and are employees
77:38 - somewhere and aren't maybe not in
77:39 - control of
77:41 - it I honestly think that the thing we
77:43 - don't talk about is age as very often as
77:45 - being probably one of the most common
77:47 - biases of you know things that we're
77:50 - discriminating whether we we want to
77:51 - talk we openly mention it or not but I
77:54 - do think I we talk about diversity in
77:56 - Tech but you know rarely do I see a a
77:59 - lot of startups where you'll see some
78:01 - older people in the company you know
78:02 - working there people that are in their
78:03 - 60s you know getting hired and and I've
78:06 - been in part of those conversation like
78:08 - ah that person's like it's hard to teach
78:09 - an old dog new tricks and stuff like
78:11 - that they're not going to like so
78:12 - there's a interesting challenge there I
78:14 - think if people maybe I think some
78:16 - sometimes people will find that
78:17 - themselves having they're kind of stuck
78:20 - in a job or feel like this is this a Ive
78:23 - space now at their their last 10 years
78:25 - of their career because they're maybe
78:27 - nervous about rejection trying to put
78:29 - themselves out there and I don't know
78:30 - how this is going to play out over the
78:32 - next several years you know le as I as
78:34 - as I get to continue to get older um you
78:38 - know there's kind of these weird phases
78:40 - we get through and like sometimes people
78:42 - think that like I'm not up to date on
78:43 - the newest things and like what are
78:44 - these kids in their 20s doing nowadays
78:47 - and but where's that kind of where's
78:49 - that where does that go at some point
78:50 - when people are feeling like they can't
78:52 - get a job somewhere else and so might
78:53 - they stick around just for fear of
78:55 - rejection or or because they've been
78:57 - rejected and like well at least I have a
78:59 - stable thing so I'm just going to sink
79:00 - in here and maybe my opportunities are
79:04 - not going to be drastically there's not
79:05 - going to be a lot of other growth
79:06 - opportunities whether that be salary or
79:08 - promotions but like I can at least stick
79:10 - in this is kind of my area that I can
79:12 - control and there's I'll stick here
79:15 - until I retire um a lot of startups
79:17 - probably aren't they'll talk about
79:19 - retirement plans but do they think long
79:21 - term about like what's a 20 30 year 30
79:24 - year career look like for someone at
79:26 - their company they're still trying to
79:27 - figure out how to make the next few
79:28 - years work let alone think about that
79:30 - far they can talk about we've got great
79:32 - benefits but you know I mean like
79:35 - startups are going to get acquired
79:37 - there's going to be all kinds of
79:38 - creative destruction the notion that you
79:41 - could get a job at a startup and still
79:42 - be working there 30 years from now I
79:44 - think is probably not realistic for not
79:48 - you know in a majority of cases but a
79:50 - lot of that is because developers tend
79:52 - to work at a startups especially over
79:54 - here on you know the West Coast where
79:56 - you got you know you got Seattle with
79:59 - all the startups you got San Francisco
80:01 - and uh you've got uh you know the Bay
80:03 - Area with all the startups I I do think
80:07 - that like if you go to like a more
80:08 - traditional kind of
80:11 - like industry like banking or hotels or
80:15 - you know um hospitals or any like i'
80:19 - I've heard the statistic that like
80:20 - two-thirds of developers work outside of
80:22 - proper Tech
80:23 - and I think in those roles you know it
80:26 - may not be so unrealistic to just work
80:29 - at the same company Long
80:32 - Term but from your experience working
80:34 - like What proportion of the companies
80:36 - you work with are tech companies to
80:38 - Planet
80:39 - orgon how would you define what a tech
80:42 - company is Quincy yeah so I would say a
80:45 - tech company it would be like the
80:47 - product is some sort of like app or
80:50 - software tool like at last is a tech
80:54 - company they have you know this Suite of
80:57 - software tools you know Salesforce is a
80:59 - tech company is you know Ford a tech
81:03 - company I would argue they aren't
81:05 - because they're a car company they may
81:06 - position themselves as a tech company
81:08 - but like that's just a very small aspect
81:10 - of what they really do which is Source
81:12 - parts from around the world and design
81:13 - cars and you know make sure that they
81:16 - meet all these different regulations and
81:17 - stuff right so the tech part as much as
81:20 - they may emphasize that is actually
81:22 - probably a pretty small proportion of
81:24 - the number of people on their team that
81:26 - are doing just that I mean you could
81:27 - argue like Finance is Tech but it's not
81:29 - really Tech in the sense that probably a
81:31 - very small minority of the people who
81:33 - work in finance are software Engineers
81:36 - same thing with like media and other
81:37 - Industries like that so I I I would say
81:39 - very specifically like tech companies
81:42 - like Microsoft is a tech company you
81:44 - know so so I I think I would reach for
81:47 - that Common Sense kind of definition of
81:49 - tech and not um not like a marketer type
81:54 - definition of what constitutes working
81:56 - in Tech no that that I think that's
81:59 - actually a really good way to kind of
82:00 - frame it I I think the thing that I I
82:02 - struggle you know I've talked about this
82:04 - in the past on some other podcasts and
82:06 - stuff like that I've always struggled a
82:08 - little bit with tech because I felt like
82:09 - it was too encompassing I think we kind
82:13 - of overuse it like oh we all work in
82:14 - Tech because we're all software
82:15 - Engineers I'm like well you know you you
82:17 - work in finance right or you're work in
82:19 - healthcare you got to think about
82:20 - Healthcare regulations like you know
82:23 - yes there's some software within that
82:25 - healthcare related company but it's is
82:28 - that it's it's just an interesting I
82:29 - guess you're using Tech to solve some
82:31 - problems I suppose but I feel like I was
82:33 - like is is the is your skill set as a
82:35 - software
82:36 - engineer just that you're really good at
82:38 - knowing how to code um solve problems
82:41 - with software code or that you know how
82:43 - to solve problems in that specific
82:45 - domain you know and you buil up that
82:47 - skill set and so like if someone's
82:48 - working at a Healthcare company and they
82:50 - want to go work at a Banking Company you
82:53 - may may not want to put like you can
82:55 - talk about all the health healthc care
82:57 - stuff certifications you might have and
82:59 - all but you're probably like I
83:01 - understand certifications and compliance
83:03 - type things that would make it I'll have
83:05 - to learn this in the finance industry
83:07 - but I can figure it out but I don't I'm
83:08 - not going to show up day one knowing all
83:10 - of that and but so I think you could you
83:12 - know if anyone listening is like domain
83:14 - expertise from working in a specific
83:16 - field as opposed to like nobody has
83:18 - domain expertise in tech tech is kind of
83:21 - like the uh implementation detail
83:24 - through which the product is created I
83:27 - can I can speak a language uh well
83:30 - there's some people at the company they
83:31 - need to speak this one particular
83:32 - language yes I can do that um may not be
83:35 - like but can you talk about these other
83:37 - Concepts and the this stuff in the
83:38 - domain so I think that's you anyhow so
83:41 - your question was how many like What
83:43 - proportion of your uh clients at Planet
83:46 - orgon are what I would narrowly Define
83:49 - as tech companies in the sense that
83:51 - they're creating software products
83:54 - um it's interesting uh even the
83:56 - companies that
83:57 - I'm we've definitely worked with a lot
83:59 - of tech companies over the years I think
84:01 - right now it's probably in the range of
84:05 - like 15 20% of our clients okay okay so
84:09 - so that that kind of matches with the
84:12 - global like the actual like us industry
84:15 - is Tech is just a small part of that
84:17 - right yeah um so do you think that uh a
84:21 - developer going to work for like one of
84:23 - your you don't have to name a specific
84:25 - client but like what do you think the
84:27 - chances are that a developer going to
84:29 - work for one of those clients would
84:31 - likely be able to work for 20 25 years
84:34 - and you know get the the gold watch and
84:37 - get the retirement and all that stuff I
84:38 - don't know if that stuff really still
84:39 - exists anymore but but basically be able
84:41 - to save up enough money that they could
84:44 - actually retire at some point like and
84:46 - and that they don't have to be careerly
84:49 - jumping from job to job just because it
84:50 - pays like 10% more each time and and
84:53 - that's the strategy of course many
84:54 - developers employ conventional wisdom is
84:57 - if you change jobs every 18 months or so
84:59 - you're going to maximize your income
85:02 - over time by by doing that and that if
85:04 - you stay in your current job you're less
85:06 - likely to be able to get AR raay because
85:08 - you wield less bargaining power because
85:12 - everybody wants to stay their job they
85:13 - don't want to have to go through the
85:14 - gauntlet every 18 months of trying to
85:17 - get a new job right true but like what
85:19 - proportion of those clients do you think
85:22 - that like people could realistically
85:25 - plan to work there
85:28 - indefinitely you
85:30 - know I mean you take like take Nike as
85:33 - an example like that is definitely a
85:34 - place people can can persist for a long
85:37 - time
85:39 - um
85:41 - the it's interesting because I think
85:43 - there's a lot of uh companies are that
85:44 - we're working with where they're a lot
85:45 - more distributed now and I think that
85:47 - sense of identity in organization and
85:50 - the remote world is hard for me to wrap
85:52 - my head around in some ways like we're a
85:53 - remote company now we weren't up until
85:55 - the pandemic and interesting so you let
85:57 - your lease go we let our lease go you
86:00 - know we had but when that happened we
86:02 - had already talked about maybe
86:04 - downsizing and maybe having s hiring
86:06 - people a little bit further away not
86:08 - just focusing on you know because
86:10 - basically we were 90% of our team would
86:12 - always be based in Portland and so I was
86:14 - like who are the best people that we can
86:16 - afford in Portland Oregon you know who
86:18 - do we move out here we would move people
86:20 - um you we move people here maybe two
86:22 - years before the pandemic we'd moved
86:24 - them to Portland you know and so and
86:26 - we'd also have to think who else is
86:28 - opening up shop in Portland
86:30 - airbnbs you know setting up an office
86:32 - and are they potentially now a
86:35 - competitor for our talent you know um
86:38 - because they use Ruby on Rails for some
86:39 - of their stack at the time and so those
86:42 - are the things you used to think about
86:43 - in a location based thing so I'm
86:44 - thinking about like company people
86:45 - sticking around at a company for 25
86:47 - years 30 years and in a remote world
86:52 - I'm just like there's a part of me I
86:54 - like have some trouble wrapping my head
86:55 - around what that looks like and the
86:56 - sense of like longevity and getting that
86:59 - go you know like and there's there's
87:02 - been companies that have been able to do
87:03 - that for you know the last couple
87:05 - decades I'm just not as familiar with
87:07 - them I don't have a lot of reference
87:09 - points I'm just like yeah because
87:10 - there's another part of me it's just
87:11 - like it feels
87:12 - very you know like it seems like
87:15 - everybody that works to plan enjoys it
87:17 - they raid us well we got you know
87:19 - awarded you know one of the best places
87:21 - workplaces you know it's like this
87:23 - online thing last year and I'm just like
87:25 - but but it feels different for me you
87:27 - know just being completely honest I'm
87:28 - like this is a really different thing
87:29 - era for me or I'm trying to get R my
87:31 - head around how do you bond with your
87:32 - team and what is what is what is it what
87:35 - is what is it that you like because we
87:37 - don't have I'm not able to make you
87:39 - waffles on January the first first the
87:41 - first day first business day of the year
87:43 - that was always a tradition like how do
87:44 - we we don't what is it about some
87:47 - waffles in like one of those uh those
87:50 - boxes with the dry iceers something the
87:53 - probably would very good waffles so I
87:55 - think is it's an interesting thing where
87:57 - I'm
87:58 - um to answer that question like I have
88:00 - no clue like and I'm not going to
88:02 - pretend that pretend to know I'm just
88:03 - like will people want to work and sign
88:05 - into someone's whatever in 10 years
88:07 - whatever the equipment of someone's
88:09 - slack is and every day and chat with
88:13 - each other for like at some point you're
88:14 - going to want to chat with other people
88:16 - I don't know so yeah I mean who knows
88:18 - maybe we'll have teleportation or
88:19 - something like like or it'll just be
88:22 - like trivially you know easy to get
88:24 - around the world and we'll we'll figure
88:25 - it out some sort of system that doesn't
88:26 - emit tons of carbon every time we get on
88:28 - a plane who knows uh but uh yeah I I can
88:33 - definitely see like remote work throwing
88:35 - a a wrench in like long-term planning
88:38 - and and like our intuition for team
88:40 - Rapport we're fully Re remote free C
88:44 - Camp and we've got about 30 people
88:45 - around the world working on the open
88:48 - source code base and working on
88:49 - instructional design and uh you know
88:53 - like we we meet for you know one 30 to
88:55 - 45 minute slot each week and the rest of
88:58 - it is just kind of ad hoc meetings and
89:00 - stuff and how do you build rapport well
89:02 - you know we're flying people into Dallas
89:04 - to to hang out for a while What
89:06 - proportion of your team is in Portland
89:08 - though
89:09 - now let's see there's what four so
89:14 - there's four of us here now um two of
89:17 - them we hired after the pandemic started
89:20 - um so only one
89:22 - person because my business partner moved
89:24 - out of moved moved out of the area
89:26 - during the pandemic so um so yeah we
89:30 - have one person that was pre pandemic
89:32 - from Portland that's still with us so
89:34 - we've just had to get used to a cycle of
89:36 - constant change so I think that also
89:37 - speaks to why it's harder for me to wrap
89:39 - my head around plus long term there and
89:41 - like now I'm thinking more of like there
89:42 - are certain types of business entities
89:44 - we can we have had clients that we've
89:46 - been working with for you know 8 to 12
89:47 - Years yet we've been able to show them
89:50 - that we can have Engineers on our team
89:52 - come and go and we can manage the
89:54 - projects keep continuity and persist
89:57 - like some collective knowledge about how
89:59 - to keep these projects running and stuff
90:00 - like that so that's one of our so
90:02 - there's a now A Thing part of me it's
90:04 - like longevity is important with employ
90:06 - I want employees to want to work here as
90:07 - long as they are but also 10year length
90:09 - is less of an emphasis now I think
90:12 - because I'm just like this might be a
90:13 - really good opportunity for someone for
90:14 - a few years you get a lot of experience
90:15 - maybe at some point in their career
90:17 - we're either really good place for
90:19 - someone early on in their career as a
90:20 - junior developer to get exposed to a lot
90:21 - of stuff that could be really valuable
90:22 - to them and we're also a good place for
90:24 - people that are further along in their
90:26 - career and they're maybe they've seen a
90:28 - lot and they're like you know what I
90:29 - want to apply some of the skills to a
90:30 - broad range of problems and I can bring
90:33 - in all this knowledge I have across get
90:35 - to work with lots of different projects
90:36 - Now versus just working at one company
90:38 - so that's kind of
90:41 - our our recruitment strategy in some
90:43 - ways now is like we can hire both ends
90:45 - of that and like the people that are
90:46 - kind of in that middle part of their or
90:49 - early middle like ambitious part of
90:50 - their thing we're not we don't we're not
90:52 - set up to like have lots of promotions
90:53 - we've got like a couple tiers yeah um
90:55 - and that and we can't keep raising our
90:57 - hourly rates at the same rate that your
90:59 - salary range wants to increase go work
91:01 - at that startup that's getting funded
91:02 - and can offer those other things like
91:04 - what I promise you is you're going to
91:05 - get we're only going to ask you to work
91:07 - this much a week we're going to work on
91:08 - different these types of client projects
91:10 - it's going to be a little messy you're
91:11 - going to need to be okay with that but
91:12 - you're going to get a lot of exposure to
91:13 - things and we're not going to call you
91:16 - on the weekends or in the evening to
91:17 - work on things unless there's like a
91:18 - really big fire that we need your help
91:20 - with otherwise we just want consistent
91:22 - stability and we want to do good client
91:24 - work and enjoy the rest of our what the
91:27 - other projects we've got going on in our
91:29 - lives yeah I mean that's a huge selling
91:32 - point for an employer to just be able to
91:33 - say no we really mean it we're really
91:35 - serious about you know the 40-hour work
91:38 - week and not having to be like patched
91:41 - in constantly on slack or whatever right
91:44 - um so yeah cudos you for uh figuring out
91:47 - kind of like a proposition where you can
91:49 - compete with you know companies that
91:52 - have way more money to throw at
91:54 - developers
91:56 - um one of the things that you know
91:58 - strikes me talking about uh longevity in
92:00 - careers is you know maintainability in
92:04 - software and continuity in having that
92:08 - code base that's been a core focus of
92:10 - yours and I'd like to shift gears a
92:13 - little bit and talk about the
92:15 - maintainable podcast excellent podcast
92:17 - which I've enjoyed listening to before I
92:20 - do I just want to point out that earlier
92:22 - I joke that teleportation might be
92:24 - possible in like 15 years I just want to
92:26 - say that I think that's probably the
92:27 - least likely technology that we'll have
92:30 - and I don't even think we'll have
92:31 - teleportation in the 24th century when
92:35 - Star Trek is happening I I think it's
92:36 - it's such a hard problem that I doubt it
92:38 - will actually exist so that was a joke
92:40 - for all the uh physics people that are
92:43 - listening in uh the doctors all the
92:44 - people out there that are like the
92:47 - philosophers um thinking that I I don't
92:49 - want them to walk away thinking that I
92:50 - think teleportation is going to happen
92:52 - anytime soon so um you've done 160
92:56 - episodes of maintainable 160 episodes so
92:59 - you've really you know maintained that
93:02 - podcast and you've optimized for you
93:04 - know longevity in that podcast what's
93:06 - the core focus of the show
93:10 - consistent conversations I think is part
93:12 - of it a consistent formula
93:16 - the the the way I look when I started
93:18 - the project there was a couple things
93:20 - you know you know
93:22 - useful to mention about how I think
93:24 - about approaching new projects like when
93:27 - I started that particular the podcast
93:29 - but how I think about projects in
93:30 - general now um but I knew that I wanted
93:35 - to have conversations with people that I
93:37 - felt like would hopefully still show to
93:41 - be relevant and valuable in then you
93:44 - know 10 to 15 years after the
93:46 - conversation was had and so I wanted to
93:50 - have conversations with people not not
93:52 - about what's
93:53 - new what's exciting what's the newest
93:55 - trends I mean that stuff occasionally
93:58 - you know trickles into the conversations
94:00 - you know like teleportation we don't
94:02 - talk about I don't talk about the future
94:04 - and stuff as much and um mainly because
94:08 - I don't know it is and I'm not g I'm not
94:10 - a good predictor of these things but
94:12 - what I do know is I've seen a lot of
94:14 - consistent problems resurface regardless
94:16 - of the technology platform I also wanted
94:18 - to have conversations with people that
94:20 - are not specifically you know I I'm I'm
94:23 - a Ruby on Rails software engineer was
94:25 - Robbie on Rails think that's my
94:27 - company's core Focus for the most part
94:28 - we also do some react and some other
94:30 - stuff I don't personally do much react
94:32 - maybe written like 20 lines of react
94:33 - code my whole life um it's not the it's
94:35 - not the thing that kind of excited me
94:37 - because again I'm more excited about
94:38 - what can I do than what I can do you
94:39 - know what the the technology itself was
94:41 - and we already had enough client work to
94:43 - keep me busy working with Ruby and rail
94:45 - stuff so the so when I did the
94:48 - maintainable software pack podcast I
94:50 - want to have conversations about what
94:52 - were some good different people's
94:54 - perspectives on what it meant to be a to
94:57 - maintain your software to what it what
95:00 - well-maintained software looks like what
95:01 - it feels like what it's like to work
95:02 - with it on a regular basis what's what
95:04 - is it like to join a project where
95:06 - there's already a lot of existing code
95:08 - because I think a lot of people in the
95:10 - education because it's just the way it
95:12 - ends up working sometimes is that you
95:14 - you get to learn how to build new things
95:16 - what when you you get introduced to
95:17 - programming and again like I we talked
95:19 - earlier at the very beginning of the
95:20 - conversation it was like hey if you
95:21 - write all this code you can play this
95:23 - game but it'd be like what if we could
95:25 - modify it how do we make how do we
95:26 - update it how do we improve upon it how
95:28 - do we make it easier to develop with how
95:30 - do we remove developer friction that
95:32 - stuff is the stuff that I'm most
95:34 - interested about because I felt like
95:35 - Ruby on Rails when I was interested like
95:37 - it removed a lot of friction made a lot
95:38 - of decisions for me and It produced
95:41 - better easier to build things but then
95:43 - it didn't
95:44 - prevent problems from occurring still
95:47 - within teams knowledge getting lost
95:50 - documentation problems
95:52 - um how we think about testing and how we
95:54 - have conversations about technical debt
95:56 - and overdue upgrades and how do we work
95:58 - with people that don't understand what
96:02 - tech de Tech debt is or do we even use
96:05 - the word Tech debt yeah let's just
96:06 - describe Tech that very quickly like two
96:08 - sentence explanation of what that is for
96:10 - anybody listening who doesn't uh
96:12 - understand that concept yet yeah this is
96:15 - a question I ask almost every one of my
96:17 - guests and it's very rarely consistently
96:20 - the same so if even my definition is
96:22 - going to be my version of it so I see
96:25 - Tech Deb
96:26 - is um the things that are that have
96:29 - accumul like kind of we use this
96:32 - metaphor because because it kind of goes
96:34 - back to like you you get debt and you
96:36 - pay it off is kind of like you know in
96:38 - the you know when you're getting a loan
96:39 - for something and we've kind
96:42 - of we've taken that and maybe stretched
96:44 - a little further in our industry some
96:46 - you know I don't think I like to use the
96:49 - word technical debt but I like to talk
96:51 - about it in the sense that it's it's I
96:54 - think the best example of it and it
96:56 - should be six two two sentence I'm not
96:58 - doing a very good job at that uh defin
97:01 - this is why it's I think it's why I love
97:02 - asking the question is it's hard uh to
97:05 - answer clearly because it's I think of
97:08 - it as like the you've made some
97:11 - intentional decisions or maybe
97:12 - even subconsciously decided to forgo
97:16 - something to get something done now but
97:20 - you're probably going to later going to
97:22 - need to later come back and revisit
97:23 - something but maybe something's good
97:25 - enough for now or you've said this is
97:28 - going to get this this code change is
97:30 - going to get out the door but you know
97:32 - we probably in you know down the road a
97:34 - little bit we're going to need to go
97:35 - back and revisit this thing because this
97:36 - is not going to scale for whatever
97:37 - reason and so there's that where's that
97:39 - balance between is it is it a debt or is
97:41 - it just like a concession that you made
97:43 - a tradeoff it's kind of like I think
97:45 - tradeoffs is maybe is a better way to
97:47 - frame them sometimes but I think another
97:50 - way to look at is like you can go to any
97:52 - team you be like what are like ask every
97:53 - developer on a team five things that are
97:56 - causing you friction in the code base or
97:58 - things that you feel like we're we
98:00 - should have changed a while ago
98:02 - everybody can probably sit down with an
98:03 - hour or two and make a good list of five
98:05 - things will they all match I don't know
98:08 - um but that might go into a technical
98:10 - debt backlog and then there's kind of
98:12 - Maintenance work that needs to happen so
98:13 - you're building new features and
98:15 - occasionally you need to go take care of
98:16 - some like
98:17 - overdue behind the scenes updates
98:20 - refactorings
98:21 - upgrades you know migrations is from one
98:25 - search engine tool to some other you
98:27 - know fulltech searching tool what
98:29 - whatever the thing might be because it
98:30 - doesn't it's no longer being supported
98:32 - or it's you know it's going to be a
98:34 - problem down the road so it it's kind of
98:37 - like was not a super clear answer but
98:40 - basically like you're kind of debt
98:41 - financing getting things now yeah and
98:44 - you are going to eventually have to pay
98:46 - the piper so to speak and uh fix those
98:49 - things if you want to have code that
98:51 - continues to work one one thing that I
98:54 - want to make sure everybody listening to
98:56 - this realizes that that I think a lot of
98:58 - people may take for granted
98:59 - non-developers and developers who are
99:01 - just getting into the field it's just
99:03 - how quickly software starts to break
99:05 - down there's a craft an important part
99:08 - for teams to figure out how they're
99:09 - going to
99:12 - regularly it's like when you you build a
99:14 - a a physical building and no one's kind
99:17 - of confused about their needing to be
99:19 - regular upkeep on it right and so I
99:21 - think it's we talk about I want to have
99:22 - this conversation with a lot of with
99:23 - with our industry
99:25 - because there are times where we build
99:28 - things for whether you're you're working
99:30 - on a part of a team or maybe if you work
99:32 - at a company that's founded by probably
99:35 - some people that understand software you
99:36 - understand this but I work with a lot
99:37 - I've worked with a lot of companies over
99:38 - the years where they build something and
99:41 - they're like What's the we need an
99:43 - estimate buil to build this piece of
99:45 - software and so someone built it for
99:47 - them and then they're like great thank
99:50 - you we got we need talk to you later and
99:53 - then they're like hey there's a bug like
99:55 - a month later like what do we do about
99:57 - this there's a performance issue or this
100:00 - weird Edge case so there's like regular
100:01 - okay we need to spend money on we need
100:03 - to invest time developer time into just
100:06 - taking care of those types of requests
100:08 - but they don't always realize that
100:09 - there's all these other little things
100:10 - behind the scenes that they're not
100:12 - requesting or their users aren't
100:13 - requesting but are just like hey look
100:15 - there's new versions of things there's
100:16 - security patches that have come out um
100:19 - Apple has their own chipsets now and the
100:22 - version of Ruby that we were running on
100:25 - is no longer supported or no one's
100:27 - compiled it yet for that and so if we
100:30 - get a new our developers get new laptops
100:32 - all of a sudden we can't spin up the
100:33 - application we need to upgrade Ruby and
100:36 - we need to patch things out in the
100:37 - production servers what have you there's
100:39 - security patches that need to get
100:40 - deployed so all these like little things
100:42 - that need to happen but your team needs
100:43 - to have like a cohesive workflow for
100:46 - regularly taking care of that stuff you
100:48 - can automate some of that stuff now with
100:50 - some tools but you need to take care of
100:52 - that stuff and there's but there's still
100:54 - a lot of things that are just more like
100:56 - code Centric things that like oh we
100:58 - designed it this way because that was
100:59 - the pattern that was kind of invogue at
101:01 - the time two years later we're now we're
101:03 - starting to see that we're having to
101:04 - work put a lot of workarounds because
101:07 - it's not quite we didn't quite use it
101:08 - the way we thought we would maybe we
101:10 - need to revisit this part of the
101:11 - application to simplify it or there's a
101:15 - lot of companies that you know there's a
101:17 - lot of conversations you know 10 years
101:18 - ago about let's all move to microser
101:20 - like you know let's break everything out
101:22 - into lots of microservices because then
101:23 - everything's kind of these bite-sized
101:25 - pieces and it all fit together and it
101:26 - won't matter if the microservice isn't
101:28 - there our team is scaling like crazy
101:30 - we're hiring 50 new Engineers every six
101:32 - months that's what going to keep
101:33 - happening so this will be the best way
101:34 - to keep everything kind of scaling for
101:37 - us and then fast forward 5 10 years and
101:39 - they're like the team's now 20th of the
101:41 - size and responsible for the amount of
101:44 - microservices that a team that was four
101:46 - times as big generated and they're like
101:48 - this is too much for us to keep in our
101:50 - head heads and what how do we manage all
101:52 - this stuff and so that becomes a
101:54 - maintenance problem and just like
101:56 - thinking about as your the decisions
101:58 - you're making at different points in the
102:00 - life cycle of a software project can
102:01 - come back and haunt you and and I want
102:03 - to have those stories and let people
102:05 - know that they're not alone that these
102:07 - are common things and also to remind
102:09 - people that most of software engineering
102:11 - isn't getting to be there day one to
102:14 - spin up the new application and get to
102:15 - build the new features a lot of what
102:17 - being a software engineer is maintenance
102:19 - work making small up bug fixes figuring
102:22 - out the quirky performance problem
102:24 - trying to understand why something was
102:25 - working in a really weird way retesting
102:29 - things and so that's the conversation
102:32 - I'm trying to have with guest on
102:33 - maintainable awesome yeah it's a great
102:35 - podcast and uh one question I had for
102:38 - you is like just off the top of your
102:40 - head for somebody who's totally new to
102:42 - listening to the podcast who's been
102:43 - doing software development for a while
102:45 - wants to be learning more and thinking
102:47 - more about maintainability of their code
102:50 - and of their their company's codebase
102:52 - and everything is there a particular
102:54 - episode that just jumps out at you is
102:55 - like oh this episode like I'm so proud
102:57 - of this
103:00 - episode you know it's a good question
103:03 - thinking about a couple that come to
103:06 - mind you know you know this is this
103:08 - again this is over almost five years of
103:11 - episodes 160 episodes yeah um so for
103:14 - that sort of like early
103:17 - on you know I'm thinking of Sandy Mets
103:20 - oh yeah as is one was one of my favorite
103:24 - conversations on there very famous rails
103:26 - developer yeah and rubius and
103:28 - objectoriented programmer and just like
103:30 - hearing her talk about like oh I'll just
103:32 - be in a in like a ruby object in a class
103:37 - file in a ruby thing and she's like I
103:39 - just start adding more classes to the
103:40 - bottom of the page and I'm just like
103:41 - what are you talking about um it was I
103:45 - learned a lot from that conversation um
103:48 - yeah that's one that quickly comes to
103:50 - mind I'm include that uh link to that in
103:52 - the show notes the video description on
103:55 - YouTube uh everybody check that out I I
103:57 - am also going to
103:59 - include do my shell which is just this
104:04 - fantastic article that you wrote many
104:06 - years ago and and you actually came on
104:08 - the free Cod cam podcast and read it uh
104:12 - Episode
104:13 - 34 uh back in
104:15 - 2018 uh so like instead of trying to
104:18 - drill deep into the story of Zell om my
104:22 - Zell and uh the open source you know
104:25 - boohemoth that you have set into motion
104:27 - uh I'm going to encourage people to to
104:29 - listen to that but one thing I do want
104:31 - to talk to you about is the Synergy uh
104:34 - you have this very popular uh one of the
104:38 - most ubiquitously used certainly on Mac
104:42 - uh tools uh command line tools and you
104:46 - also have this podcast about
104:49 - maintainability you of course have your
104:52 - uh Robbie on Rails blog that you were
104:56 - updating as of you know four or five
104:58 - years ago um and and of course you've
105:01 - got the consultancy planet argon and I
105:04 - wanted to think about like how those
105:06 - have those kind of like Voltron together
105:08 - to create like the ultimate like lean
105:11 - mean like Robbie Russell publicizing
105:14 - machine over the years like like do
105:16 - people come to you and like oh yeah I'm
105:17 - a huge fan of om my Zell or I'm a fan of
105:20 - the podcast like does that resting
105:22 - client work for you
105:24 - all you'd think you know I get this from
105:27 - a lot of people and they they're
105:29 - surprised to find out that it it doesn't
105:33 - really I can't say that like a lot of my
105:37 - clients probably give a or even
105:39 - know what the hell om Zell is
105:41 - occasionally I'll be on a call with a
105:43 - client and they might have some
105:45 - engineers and then they they they might
105:47 - know who I am or know about omz shell um
105:51 - and and so they'll come like oh I was
105:53 - talking with some because it's usually
105:54 - someone in like a different department
105:56 - it's like I'm working with someone like
105:57 - in
105:58 - some logistical part of some company and
106:00 - they're like this like this
106:01 - manufacturing company and they have like
106:03 - a fulfillment center and they're I'm
106:05 - talking with someone there and they're
106:06 - like hey we have this thing built with
106:07 - rubby on RS blah blah blah you people
106:10 - showed up in our Google searches and
106:11 - seem to be reputable um so I feel like
106:15 - we can talk about these things like I
106:16 - also have a podcast or omell is another
106:19 - thing so the thing that I I think it's
106:21 - helped the most though is we do get ref
106:24 - referrals you know we get referred from
106:26 - peers in the industry so that does end
106:28 - up being a way that we've gotten some of
106:30 - our projects over the years um where it
106:32 - might be Freelancers or some other
106:34 - agencies that are deciding to no longer
106:37 - be an agency or they maybe they got
106:38 - acquired or interesting so if an agency
106:41 - is going out of business so to speak
106:42 - then they'll they'll kind of like pass
106:43 - on their clients to you they try to like
106:45 - help them help rehome them it's like a
106:47 - natural thing like you want to if you
106:49 - have a long relationship so sometimes
106:50 - that they have like one or two big
106:52 - clients and they're like well this is
106:54 - something they've been working like we
106:55 - have we had a client that came to us or
106:57 - a company come to us a couple years ago
106:58 - with a large client that they'd work
107:00 - with for like 15 years um a couple
107:02 - different Technologies but they
107:03 - primarily use Rand rails and they're
107:05 - like yeah like the owner of the company
107:07 - had some health issues he's like I'm
107:08 - retiring closing up shop and this isn't
107:11 - like I want I want to put them in good
107:14 - hands and you you seem like you can
107:16 - probably carry them the next 10 years
107:18 - can you be that company can we can we
107:21 - trust that you they'll be in good hands
107:22 - so that stuff that that occasionally
107:24 - happens and so if you're running an
107:26 - agency you think you're getting out of
107:27 - the you know call plan Aron anyways uh
107:30 - but as far as like that the the other
107:32 - part of that the you know it was funny
107:34 - this last year I went to um a conference
107:37 - in where was it it was in Amsterdam
107:40 - called rails world and I was there I was
107:43 - I I I interviewed the rails core team
107:45 - that hosted like a panel discussion like
107:47 - an AMA thing that I I ran and I I I was
107:51 - meeting people there that knew me for
107:54 - omay Z shell and they're like why are
107:55 - you at this
107:57 - conference like why why rail it's
107:59 - interesting so so like you got your om
108:02 - my Zell like super user fans and then
108:05 - you've got your rails blog fans from
108:07 - back in the day and then you've probably
108:09 - got lots of people who you just just
108:11 - know you from your work argon right like
108:14 - so it's almost like they're like three
108:16 - different kinds of Robbie Russell fans
108:19 - yeah only like connect the dots no they
108:22 - don't connect the dots and so I was like
108:24 - at the rails conference I'm passing out
108:26 - omel stickers to people and I love that
108:30 - I mean it's like and like a lot of
108:31 - people like I didn't know you were a
108:33 - ruby developer I didn't know like I'm
108:35 - like I'm like I'm like oh Mya wouldn't
108:37 - have existed if it wasn't for the ru and
108:39 - rails Community like all of the original
108:41 - ideas came from other
108:43 - rubyists and I shared it with my Ruby on
108:45 - Rails community and they shared it and
108:47 - GitHub was written you know was written
108:49 - with Ruby Ms and it was one of the first
108:52 - big siiz project open source projects on
108:54 - GitHub early on and it's all kind of
108:57 - like connected in this weird way but
108:59 - like you know fast forward 10 15 years
109:01 - and actually yeah I think om Zell turns
109:03 - 15 years this September August or
109:06 - something so which is wild to think of
109:09 - that that's had its own lifespan but
109:11 - it's not but it was it came out of like
109:14 - a rubyan Real's developer working with
109:16 - his co-workers and wanting to have some
109:19 - consistent uh shortcuts and little
109:22 - tricks up their sleeves to to improve
109:25 - their their their efficiency and the
109:27 - command line yeah yeah awesome well
109:29 - congratulations on being able to
109:31 - interview the rails score team by the
109:32 - way that's a really cool
109:34 - honor yeah
109:36 - so we're getting toward the end of the
109:39 - podcast we've been talking for a while
109:40 - and we we've covered so much but I just
109:43 - wanted to delve a little bit more into
109:45 - your you know very interesting personal
109:47 - life like I don't have a lot of guests
109:49 - on here who are in a post rock band and
109:53 - you know play guitar and do sets and
109:55 - release albums and and they've been
109:56 - doing that for a long time maybe you
109:58 - could take a moment to just talk about
110:01 - what post rock is uh for the uninitiated
110:05 - and like what your particular band uh
110:08 - how you all approach it and maybe what
110:11 - the name means like a what is aula is it
110:15 - just like like a place or oh um so the
110:18 - band is named The Mighty moua Missoula
110:21 - okay moua I didn't pronounce it
110:23 - correctly it's a place right uh there's
110:25 - a place called Missoula Montana in the
110:28 - United States uh which is named after
110:30 - something else uh as well so so first on
110:33 - the name the the mighty Missoula is a
110:35 - reference to many many many years ago
110:38 - this before most of us were in on in
110:42 - before there were a lot of humans there
110:44 - trying to remember how many years I
110:45 - forget how many years ago it was there
110:47 - were a series of large floods that swept
110:50 - across the Pacific Northwest and helped
110:52 - carve out a lot of like the Columbia
110:54 - Gorge which if anyone doesn't know but
110:56 - the Columbia river goes Cuts between
110:58 - Oregon and Washington and quite a bit of
111:00 - Washington state is is like a massive um
111:03 - River and so there were floods that were
111:07 - basically started because there was this
111:10 - uh glacial Lake in where where is now
111:14 - like modern day like Montana where is
111:16 - this huge glacial Lake and it like I
111:18 - think it bursts through about 12 times
111:20 - and just would flood all the way almost
111:22 - all the way to the Pacific Ocean like
111:24 - that's how massive of a lake it was that
111:25 - it would just sweep across and so
111:28 - drastically impacted the a substantial
111:30 - portion of you know the United States
111:33 - was underwater at this point flooded you
111:36 - have any idea what like geological ERA
111:38 - this was like double check it's the um
111:41 - this was during during the end of the
111:43 - last ice age okay so and so when so the
111:49 - the band it's called The Mighty Missoula
111:51 - and that's a reference to these floods
111:53 - one of the ideas was like the Missoula
111:54 - floods or something like that and we
111:55 - thought that was too obvious so we went
111:57 - with the mighty missula and people could
111:59 - ask us what the name meant and we like
112:00 - well there's these floods it's a GE
112:03 - geology nerd type thing um because and
112:06 - it kind of shaped the Pacific Northwest
112:09 - um landscape quite a bit there's lots of
112:11 - areas you can see where where the
112:14 - flooding impacted there's debris and
112:16 - like huge rocks in the middle of like
112:19 - areas that do look like why is there a
112:20 - huge Boulder that's like 50 feet tall
112:23 - yeah how did I get there um because it
112:26 - was it was a rock and a big flood anyhow
112:29 - um the so the mighty miza is we're a
112:32 - post rock band in like we're basically
112:35 - we're instrumental kind of art rock band
112:38 - and post rock is a genre of music that's
112:41 - you know it's funny now it's like it was
112:43 - trying to be not kind of break some of
112:45 - the rules of standard rock music and try
112:48 - to like let you you can just like drone
112:50 - on about things and not have to follow a
112:52 - lot of super consistent formulas for how
112:54 - you write and produce your music it can
112:56 - be more ethereal
112:58 - atmospheric um I like to think about the
113:01 - music that I listen to when I'm working
113:03 - whether I'm writing code or I'm emailing
113:06 - I don't like to listen to a lot of music
113:07 - with vocals and so a lot of music that
113:10 - resonated to me and like early on in my
113:13 - you know think back it's funny music
113:15 - ends up you know being this like thing
113:17 - that you can connect to certain periods
113:18 - of your life like um I
113:21 - remember listening to like a lot of
113:23 - Boards of Canada and which is not um
113:27 - postrock but you know there was mostly
113:29 - instrumental yeah similar drum stuff
113:31 - qualities in terms of being something
113:34 - you can kind of like listen to in the
113:36 - background and it's yeah you know like
113:38 - the ambient of the 1994 everybody called
113:41 - that ambient back then right and then it
113:43 - would just feel like I guess like Apex
113:45 - Twin s ambient Works to ambient right
113:50 - exactly and so there's so like bands in
113:54 - that realm if you know couple of bands
113:56 - like sear Ro is kind of considered a
113:58 - post rock band um explosions of the sky
114:01 - from you know from down in Texas where
114:03 - you're at um MW Gods Speedy black
114:06 - Emperor you know I was listening to a
114:08 - lot of this stuff in there you know like
114:10 - 2001 2002 um got to see explosions of
114:12 - this guy the very first time they played
114:14 - at some small Club here in Portland
114:15 - Oregon and I was in a goth rock band at
114:17 - the time this was probably yeah maybe
114:20 - 3 and two or so and went to the small
114:23 - club and saw them CU I found their music
114:26 - on Napster or something and went to go
114:28 - see them play and I remember thinking
114:30 - they're a band without vocals how
114:31 - interesting could that be and I went
114:34 - there and I was like this was like one
114:35 - of the most engaging shows I've ever
114:37 - been to I was like just enamored by what
114:39 - was happening how I felt with the music
114:41 - and I was like and I was in a band that
114:43 - didn't really like my singer all that
114:45 - much and the drummer or the bass player
114:46 - and I had talked about like it'd be cool
114:48 - we always like when we're just jamming
114:49 - on stuff before the rest of the band
114:51 - gets there and we start working on our
114:53 - music like like just noodling on things
114:54 - like let's start our own project so I my
114:57 - first post rock band was back then it
114:59 - was called the vacant we did that for a
115:00 - couple years and then Planet argon took
115:02 - off and the Bas player she got pregnant
115:04 - and our lives kind of went a different
115:06 - direction and then so for years I wasn't
115:08 - really playing music but um about I
115:11 - think maybe going back like seven no
115:13 - probably like nine years ago now I think
115:16 - I was like looking at my equipment and
115:17 - occasionally playing with my guitar I
115:19 - was like I need to collaborate with
115:21 - people
115:22 - again and and so I didn't feel like I
115:25 - was progressing personally by just
115:27 - playing like I'm like oh I'll work on my
115:29 - own music and right stuff I play a
115:31 - couple different instrument I can't do
115:32 - drums or anything but I can at least
115:34 - make some interesting ambian type music
115:36 - with guitar and some bass and stuff like
115:38 - that and some synths and such but I was
115:41 - like no I want to work on a project with
115:42 - other people and like let's see what
115:43 - comes out so posted out on
115:46 - Craigslist you know found a drummer
115:48 - found a bass player over appear time
115:50 - start putting together a band we you
115:52 - know we start writing some songs we pick
115:53 - a name we record an EP and then our
115:56 - drummer moves away for for journalism
116:00 - school I have to find a new drummer and
116:02 - then like he has different skill sets
116:04 - can do a lot more recording stuff as
116:05 - well we our skill set drastically
116:07 - improves our WR songwriting evolves
116:10 - write another album then the pandemic
116:12 - happens we're stuck at home we during
116:15 - the pandemic we were we our album
116:18 - release so we printed vinyl we were
116:20 - releasing our album April 2020 we were
116:23 - planning like our you know launch show
116:25 - you know album release made vinyl we
116:28 - were super proud of this thing we're
116:29 - like we're going to put together a tour
116:31 - that
116:32 - summer we're all stuck at home um okay
116:35 - maybe not and so then during that
116:39 - period we IID wanted to work on some
116:41 - more ambient stuff like let's strip away
116:43 - the drums our drummer can do a lot of s
116:46 - and and soundscaping type stuff so like
116:49 - we we all stuck at our home so we
116:50 - decided we would make an ambient album
116:53 - and we would pass files around the cloud
116:55 - it was all cloud-based themed um so we
116:58 - did that as a way to continue writing
117:00 - together and build up some new skills
117:01 - during that period and that way we knew
117:03 - that when we got back together post
117:05 - coming out of you the the next album
117:07 - that we're working which we just
117:08 - finished recording a month ago and we're
117:10 - now in the the final mixing stages right
117:12 - now so that'll be released sometime this
117:14 - summer um so that was pretty exciting
117:16 - and last year we got to go play a
117:18 - festival in the postre f in Indianapolis
117:20 - so we did a tour across the country to
117:22 - that and back and played a lot of shows
117:24 - with anywhere from four people in the
117:27 - audience to you know several dozen you
117:29 - know type of thing to playing at the
117:31 - festival with like hundreds of people
117:32 - there and that was pretty exciting but
117:34 - yeah it was it I'm kind of I kind of
117:36 - look at it as like it's it's a hobby I'm
117:39 - not this isn't going to be my career by
117:40 - any
117:41 - means who knows but it's kind of like a
117:44 - little bit feels like cosplay sometimes
117:46 - um like it's like we're banned we're
117:48 - we're doing this fun stuff but like it's
117:50 - a fun hobby and and it keeps me you know
117:53 - out of the house a couple days a week to
117:54 - go work with other people on and it's
117:56 - not my project it's our project I might
117:58 - have posted the original Craigslist ad
118:00 - and so I think in some ways I'm like the
118:02 - leader a little bit I have that project
118:03 - management skill set but I'm not but
118:05 - it's our band it's like yeah do you ever
118:07 - have to like kind of like suppress your
118:11 - manager I mean you're a CEO so like
118:13 - you're used to like figuring out what
118:14 - needs to be done and like listening to
118:16 - everybody's opinions and then making a
118:18 - decision and people are expecting to go
118:19 - along with it that that doesn't really
118:21 - work in your band though right like is
118:22 - it more democratic or or are you
118:25 - somewhat autocratic it is it's it's a
118:27 - lot more democratic sometimes we'll have
118:29 - conversations like who cares the most
118:31 - about this particular decision there's
118:34 - you know I gu like our our drummer I
118:36 - mentioned has like a lot more he went to
118:38 - school and he has a background in in uh
118:42 - Sound Engineering so like things on that
118:44 - realm we kind of defer to him to help
118:45 - make a lot of decisions and kind of
118:47 - guide us and teach us through it but he
118:48 - also has a really good knack for being a
118:50 - good producer which is you know and and
118:53 - that's and someone that can help unblock
118:56 - us or help like when you're recording
118:58 - something in front of other people and
119:00 - you're trying to figure it out it's like
119:02 - I think I think about music I think
119:03 - everybody has this idea that you write
119:04 - the music and it's all perfect and
119:06 - you're going to play it the same way
119:07 - every single time and it's like that's
119:08 - not what happens I just watched Quincy
119:11 - do the uh intro song like three times um
119:14 - and they all sound a little bit they all
119:15 - sounded great three different times um
119:17 - different ways and that's that's the way
119:18 - it works so like sometimes you're kind
119:21 - of like you don't remember how you did
119:23 - something or it doesn't quite feel the
119:24 - same when you actually go to record it
119:26 - and and like someone has an idea like no
119:28 - do it the way you did it originally and
119:29 - you're like I don't and there's there's
119:31 - a performance aspect as well it's like
119:34 - sometimes I want to play the Baseline
119:35 - just like it was on the record but maybe
119:39 - mechanically like I get tripped up by
119:41 - some sort of like jump or something like
119:42 - that yeah and uh yeah so can't reproduce
119:47 - everything and yeah you don't
119:48 - necessarily want to that's why people
119:49 - are you know still bootlegging grateful
119:52 - Day concerts uh I mean how many concerts
119:54 - have they done and there's probably a
119:56 - recording of pretty much every single
119:58 - recording and fans will listen to all
120:01 - the different versions of like very
120:03 - similar kind of like I guess and jazz is
120:07 - an entire art based around the notion of
120:09 - having like kind of like a motif if you
120:11 - will and then like diving into you know
120:15 - jamming
120:17 - essentially it's true the um
120:20 - it's just that's the thing about so to
120:22 - answer your question yeah I don't feel
120:23 - like I have to put my CEO in hat very
120:25 - often I mean I'm usually the one that's
120:26 - like over looking finances for the band
120:29 - and like dealing with some of like the
120:31 - the paperwork when we're negotiating
120:33 - some stuff for like a a festival or
120:35 - shows or something like that but um but
120:38 - otherwise yeah everything else is very
120:40 - collaborative and and and I kind of like
120:42 - let them drive a lot more of some of the
120:44 - songw writing I might have like some
120:45 - guitar ideas I have and but they're
120:47 - definitely I'm surrounded myself with
120:49 - people that are much better musicians
120:51 - and so I get to kind of grow with them
120:53 - which is a thing that I appreciate about
120:56 - like the types of projects that I do
120:57 - like you mentioned omell the thing about
120:59 - omell it's like I might have planted
121:02 - this flag once upon a time that here's
121:04 - this kind of concept and the structure I
121:07 - have and then and immediately I was like
121:10 - please contribute and now we've had over
121:12 - 2,000 people contribute code to the
121:15 - project and so I'm just like it's it's
121:18 - become what it is because of the people
121:20 - that decided they wanted to participate
121:22 - and they felt like they could and maybe
121:24 - I made it easier for people to
121:26 - contribute in some way or at least made
121:28 - it inviting and that that's helped you
121:30 - know after we finish this I'm going to
121:31 - hop over to an omell maintainer meeting
121:33 - with the two other people that help
121:34 - maintain the project and I've never met
121:37 - them in person yet actually hoping to do
121:39 - that in a few months actually um but
121:42 - it's just like I I just Sur and that's
121:44 - why I don't I didn't like being a
121:46 - consultant an early era Contracting
121:49 - thing you know outside of my you know I
121:52 - mentioned my partner that was a designer
121:53 - we would work collaboratively but I
121:54 - didn't really get to feel like I was up
121:56 - leveling as a developer because I wasn't
121:58 - really working with a lot of other peer
122:00 - developers very often just kind of like
122:01 - figuring things out myself and so I felt
122:03 - like I've excelled the more that I've
122:05 - leaned into working on projects that
122:07 - involved other people to help get the
122:09 - thing done and other skill sets people
122:11 - that were better programmers or deeper
122:12 - programmers in certain things and there
122:14 - was Project managers and there was a
122:15 - designer and there's and the
122:17 - collaborative aspect of working with the
122:18 - client or other people to bounce ideas
122:20 - off of and like to review my code or for
122:23 - me to review someone else's
122:25 - code that's that's the world I like to
122:27 - live in and so like we'll talk to a lot
122:29 - of people that are
122:30 - Freelancers and I'm like I don't
122:32 - understand that that world like how
122:35 - you've decided that that's the thing you
122:36 - want to do I'm like what's wrong with
122:37 - you why don't you trust people U I'm
122:40 - kind of jokingly saying that and and
122:43 - it's like but what what is it that
122:44 - you're like I want to just go do my own
122:46 - thing and maybe and that's like an
122:48 - interesting thing for me to wrap my head
122:50 - around because that doesn't make sense
122:51 - to my brain but I um so even though I
122:55 - thought I wanted to DIY it it was always
122:57 - about like I wanted to do my thing but I
123:00 - didn't think that it was going to become
123:02 - this thing with employees as soon as I
123:04 - had that around me I was like oh how
123:06 - could I do this any other way this is
123:08 - way better yeah well so to some extent
123:12 - your DIY spirit is like a victim of his
123:14 - own
123:15 - success a little bit Yeah Yeah well uh I
123:19 - just have one closing question uh
123:20 - because you know Portland seems to be
123:23 - like a really key aspect of your life
123:25 - you know you chose to move there you've
123:27 - stayed there much longer than I've ever
123:28 - lived in any one city um
123:31 - and if somebody's going to Portland for
123:34 - the first
123:35 - time what is something they hands down
123:37 - should
123:38 - consider taking a day to
123:41 - do if they're
123:44 - able-bodied to leave Portland and go out
123:47 - to the gorge and go on some hikes or a
123:50 - hike somewhere there's a couple great gr
123:52 - hikes feel free to write me I'll give
123:53 - you a list of a couple things depending
123:55 - on your I would say your ability to
123:58 - threshold of how much pain you want to
124:00 - endure or not um so that I mean there
124:02 - really like so much of like the thing I
124:03 - love about Portland is so close like 30
124:06 - minutes away and you can be hiking in
124:08 - some pretty gorgeous areas
124:11 - um reminds me that early on there was a
124:13 - rails conference we we we shuttled a
124:16 - couple buses we rented some bus charter
124:18 - buses and we took a bunch of Ruby on
124:19 - Rails developers hiking one afternoon as
124:23 - a way to like let's go do this and like
124:24 - let's show you outside but if you're in
124:26 - Portland one thing that I would do like
124:29 - inside the city is honestly I think just
124:33 - like you know it's like cliche to like
124:36 - talk about if I like wandering the
124:38 - coffee roasies and getting to check out
124:40 - different coffee shops and stuff like
124:41 - that something I enjoy doing in any City
124:43 - so maybe it's I feel like that was more
124:46 - of a thing more of a Portland thing
124:48 - early in the air and so I still think
124:49 - about that which kind of just got me
124:51 - excited when every time I travel now I'm
124:52 - like I want to go find the coffee
124:53 - roaster STS and try coffee but that was
124:56 - more I feel like that still leans on
124:57 - being kind of slightly more of a
124:59 - Portland origin type of thing so I think
125:02 - checking out some of those old coffee
125:04 - roasteries is a thing and is there a
125:06 - specific
125:07 - Street a specific Street where like a
125:09 - lot of them are collocated or no they
125:13 - they're all kind of around now um like
125:16 - the what ends up happening is like the
125:17 - places that are on the
125:20 - the more popular streets they might turn
125:22 - into chains and
125:24 - then it depends like I don't want people
125:27 - to judge me because I'm like oh Haw ha's
125:29 - ha's still cute um but I'm like actually
125:32 - I don't know if any of the roasteries
125:34 - there are the like actual roasteries
125:37 - over there right now so they're all kind
125:38 - of like scattered a little bit okay but
125:40 - Hawthorne is like a destination that a
125:42 - lot of people might like if you're a
125:44 - total Portland novice and you're just
125:46 - looking for a single word remember
125:49 - Hawthorne it sounds like is uh get hop
125:52 - in the the taxi take me to Uber uh take
125:55 - take me to Hawthorne and stuff on it
125:57 - right exactly that and Andor uh and then
126:00 - hit the pals on Hawthorne but if you
126:01 - have time go downtown and go to the big
126:03 - PALS like that's still our our
126:05 - independent bookstore there is PALS huge
126:08 - so definitely spend hours there awesome
126:11 - well Robbie it has been an honor to have
126:13 - you on the podcast again everybody who's
126:16 - listening to this be sure to check out

126:24 - article uh which I'm linking to in the
126:26 - show notes also check out that Sandy
126:28 - Mets episode of maintainable and uh I'm
126:30 - going to also link to one of your recent
126:32 - live sets that I found on YouTube uh
126:34 - from the mighty
126:37 - Missoula um and uh yeah thank you so
126:41 - much for coming on thank you for
126:42 - maintaining om my Z shell which like I
126:45 - think most of the people on pream team
126:47 - use it probably on a daily basis um and
126:51 - uh thank you again for just being so so
126:53 - giving of your wisdom from running a
126:55 - consultancy the past 22 years and all
126:59 - the lessons you've learned and being so
127:00 - candid this is really means a lot
127:02 - because people can this is like the
127:04 - unvarnished like implementation details
127:07 - of running a to right yes I don't have a
127:10 - uh I don't have a a publicist to help me
127:13 - figure out how to better frame my
127:14 - narrative and thank you Quincy thanks
127:16 - for having me on thanks for everything
127:18 - that you and code Camp are doing um
127:19 - thanks for introducing for being part of
127:21 - the reason why I've met such a good
127:23 - friend here in Portland Abby through
127:25 - Abby editor for free code Camp uh you've
127:28 - almost certainly seen her work even if
127:29 - you haven't directly read an article by
127:31 - her I need to pick up that book uh
127:34 - getting things done as well I'm excited
127:37 - about that new book on freeo Camp press
127:38 - check it out uh Omar rosenbom wrote he
127:41 - he is a git Enthusiast to say the least
127:44 - he writes like a 300 page book on git so
127:47 - that's wonderful check that out
127:49 - yeah until next week everybody happy
127:52 - coding

Cleaned transcript:

we're here with Robbie Russell founder cofounder of Planet argon Studios and creator of the very popular oh my zsh uh open source repository and Tool yeah thanks thanks for having me joining us from beautiful Portland Oregon uh his adopted home yeah I've been here for 20 what year is it 20 2024 oh my gosh uh it'll be 24 years in uh July I guess that I moved here so yeah more half of my life now yeah and uh originally from California G yeah I grew up in yeah just south of uh like Silicon Valley my dad worked in Silicon Valley and hardware and we lived in a little small suburb town that was kind of on the edge of very Southern there's like I don't remember if it's actually the furthest south town in Santa clar County but yeah it's um it's kind of like at the time is very farmland and you know track houses and stuff like that and so was maybe about an hour and a half or so South of San Francisco and maybe 45 minutes south of San Jose yeah and uh Gilroy that's like garlick town right is that is that the like the world capital of garlic the crop it likes to call itself that um I don't know that it's actually where most of garlic is produced nowadays I think most of it's actually produced in China um but yeah there was a huge uh garlic scene there if you will uh it smelled like garlic people it's either you loved it or ha it if you drove through our town um coincidentally the town just north of us had had a lot of mushrooms that they grew and so their Town smell like poop can I swear on this podcast smell like but they were like slightly wealthier town and so there was this weird competitive thing and like your town smells you guys are poor down in gory they made the the the fossi and bargain yeah our Town's going to smell terrible but we're going to be slightly better off than our neighbors exactly um so yeah I grew up in the garlic Capital world and all I wanted to do as soon as I became a teenager was figure out how to get out of living in gy and move to a some sort of city Urban environment that's what I wanted to be around yeah right on man well uh obviously you found Portland to be like a a good place to be because you've been there for like basically your entire adult life most of it um you've got like a very um I mean you're very very portlandian in like pretty much um your interests and things that you do you're like very outdoorsy from what I understand and um yeah like what what inspired you to go to Portland specifically and uh it was really cool by the way hanging out eating tacos with you it was it was good that we got the chat and um I didn't I didn't know what to expect from the conversation and yeah we had a number of tacos and talked about all facets of life um with you and Abby over there at free Cod Camp um who's become a really good friend coincidentally um thanks to free code Camp uh we can talk about that if you want to but um yeah think about why did I move to Portland well the short story is that I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life my career I didn't have any like real I was painting houses for about three years prior to moving to Portland I I since I was 17 I dropped out of high school halfway through my junior year and then ended up getting a job with like a painting company that my my one of my uncles worked at and learn to sand and touch up and eventually learn how to paint and take care of wood and paint roof the things that are on I forget what they're called flashing flashing and all the the things flashing gutters yeah flashing is like the metal stuff that might be covering like there'll be like you know air vents on top of a house anyways I got to learn how to paint houses for really fancy really fancy houses in uh Santa Clara County um like we occasionally work on you know multimillion dollar houses for people that work in Silicon Valley or maybe they were like they they're like um like one of the players or something from like the the San Jose Sharks a hockey team like their big you know big house they were building up on the hills and so I got to work on those types of projects which were not like kind of get in and get out short projects they were very much like we would be there for like a month two months working on painting and prepping and painting working as their house was being built and making nice cabinets and so we would make paint or cabinets like the big style at the time was making cabinets look like they were basically White plastic even though it was like really fancy wood I don't such a weird how Styles change over time quirky in interior decorating train right so I learned a lot about like the craft and how much work went into prepping before you even pulled the paint out right before the paint dries and then touching up and taking care of that stuff um when I was a teenager after having dropped out of high school and so that's that's what I was doing and I'm like I actually thought I might if you do I think in California I don't know if it's like that all states but before you could start like your own say painting company if I had I I kind of had a little bit of aspiration like oh maybe one day I'll I'll run a painting company like I think I could probably do this and have some people maybe work for me and I'll just work in construction but that also the reality was it would mean that I'd be working construction and I didn't find that you know it's funny that we talk about diversity in Tech over the years and I'm like construction was there was a lot of cultural diversity um where people were from and stuff but it was mostly male dominated and I didn't really like working with just men all the time and so I thought that was you know that that was actually one of the things I thought it was a very toxic environment as a I kind of saw myself as this kind of anarcho uh punk rock kid who was trying to like you know pushing you know like I want my gay friends to be able to get married and like here I'm going to work every day and everybody's talking in very conservative and very maledominated environment and kind of objectified women and when whenever we'd see women on the like the job sites that was like always like you know there's a lot of cat calling and stuff and I'm like this is not an environment that I feel like I want to spend a lot of time in um so anyways we that's a whole story and of itself so I decided I wasn't going to do that forever and like this is like I didn't want to work around that environment forever so uh I wanted to move to a city and I didn't make very much money painting and I didn't and I was like well I was kind of doing some odd jobs here and there doing some like tech support stuff and so but the price to live in Portland was technically cheaper than it was in Gilroy interesting and it was like it was a city that had vegetarian restaurants like punk rock scene um I can go see music it felt relatively clean um as a city in the sense like you walk around downtown and there' be like you know some gutter Punk kids and I'm like well worst case if I don't find a job here I can just be a gutter Punk kid and get a dog and just kind of hang around and um I'll just I'll figure it out I'm just like maybe kind of glamorized this like DIY lifestyle and Portland has exuded that I I would have loved to moved to Berkeley or Santa San Francisco or Santa Cruz but I couldn't I couldn't afford that those are expensive cities to live in I didn't know it wasn't programming or anything at that point um much to speak of anyways um not thinking that would be a viable thing and the other part of like wanting to move out of California was that I felt like everything was kind of driven towards hey if you should work in the computer industry that like my father worked in Silicon Valley he just retired a couple months ago he worked in hardware and he was always like you need to you should really be interested in software he was always trying to encourage me to get interested in software buy me books on softare I always I always had computers around I had my very my own computer which was always like my dad's the one he basically would grow out of I got the one he get the he get a 386 I got the 286 he got the 486 I got the 386 and so it just be I just learned how to work around with computers a lot as a kids using them to play games and using some of the the software that would come on it making cool little spreadsheets and stuff like that or Ms paint or playing weird games on the you know command line games and stuff like that but uh I just never resonated with me like learning how to programming I just thought it was it it didn't seem like an interesting thing for whatever reason it was like because it was always presented as like hey if you learn if you write out this code into this you know this editor thing um andun run it then you can play the game and I was like okay so I'd be maybe typing what it was doing for I get bored like I've just like you know basically rewriting something from a book yeah under the computer I'm like I'm can I go outside and play with my friends I'm G to go do that you know this is like can I just play the game someone already did it and yeah you're basically doing rework I mean there was definitely a time where there just wasn't enough memory and like it was more practical to distribute printed copies of the code and have people type it in themselves but I'm sure that by the time you were a kid that that time had passed and it was more like a an exercise yeah it was more of the exercise like learning it was never really presented as like well if you get it to run and then we can then change it make different you know modify it to do something a little differently let's change like we never had that conversation so I never that there was never that little aha moment of like o I can do something different with it um and so I wrote a couple blog posts in the past about like how my my dad failed to teach me or get me excited about programming um when I was young and I think it was just like we're that was the ingredient that I think I was missing was like wouldn't it be kind of neat if we can make something to do X Y and Z and then let's figure that out which I think speaks to how I learned about things and why so so very practical kind of appli like you don't seem to me like the person who Geeks out on technology for the sake of Technology itself it's all about what can this technology do for me exactly um the you know I think if he had you know I played I played you know Little League baseball and things like that as a kid and um so what like I remember I was really interested in stats for for our team and so we would track the stats for our game you know for for all of our players couple years I would do this and then I would like and my dad and I would like put some stuff together in like a spreadsheet and then like regenerate this thing and I bring a print out to the team you'd be like here's your stats for the season you know like here's your on based things and your your batting average and pitching details and so we could track some of that stuff over time because uh there wasn't like a web page or anything that kids this you know this is all late 80s early 90s yeah period of time and so if we had had a conversation like wouldn't it be cool like if we could build a little tool that maybe every week you come back from the game and like plug in the new numbers and then it would regenerate the report or something like that probably would have I probably would have that would have resonated I think really well with me but it was that wasn't what we did we we learned I got to learn how to use spreadsheets and stuff like that I think it was like Lotus 123 or something back then but so I still got to learn how to use the tools that you could use and you know like build spreadsheets and stuff like that and coincidentally another thing my dad kind of encouraged was we were always bu building our own computers so we would go buy all the parts and then we put it together and so I learned how to do that with him and I became like this weird thing where he would kind of show off to his friends because they would want to get a computer and maybe they weren't they didn't work in the computer industry um that's I'm just going to say the computer because that's how I refer to it that's how my dad and people referred to it like oh they work in computers that's kind of what we said like now it's like everybody works in now we use like we work in Tech and that's a weird yeah thing to call it as well but the there was this like we' build it and then we like you know maybe a neighbor would get their first computer and then I I would be then sent over for a week or two every couple couple like maybe an hour a couple times a week to teach them how to do stuff on it and so be like here show them how to like open up Word Perfect or how to use the spreadsh thing or how to teach the kids how they can start the games themselves you know and put the floppy thing in here's how to install it but then here's some shortcuts you can add to your DOS prompt to like here's the commands you you you run to like launch you know to play Commander Keen or something and so that became something like I kind of was good at maybe teaching people how to do things like it um and showing them like well if you know if my dad's kid kid could figure this out I could probably figure it out you know like so I was kind of paraded around in that sort of way like some of the so it sounds like the fact that your dad was you know encouraging you and that you had Hardware on hand I mean uh that you did have kind of like uh what many people would call like like uh an ideal kind of like um ground soil for growing as a potential developer in growing up around the tools uh having somebody in your life who was already making a living from these tools and and that kind of seed the seeds of later on when you were you know considering your options uh potentially getting more into computers maybe you could talk a little bit about that that period where you wanted to go into business and pot you you were ambitious you wanted to have uh a company that was potentially going around painting but you you weren't like in love with the kind of construction work culture will what what did you do how did you go about uh ultimately creating a consultancy like what what was the uh process in between those two points there's there's a couple of factors and you know I haven't really spent a lot of time reflecting on this specific point but I feel like in this conversation is kind of highlighting something that I you know earlier I mentioned that I kind of was I I in during that same time that I was painting I was obs obsessed with DIY punk rock culture East Bay East Bay Port um and East Bay um in the Bay Area in California uh it was like a lot of punk bands came out of that area there was like a lot of small record companies that were like it was just like kids that were maybe four to five years older than me had running record labels selling stickers through cataloges and I started one my my very first business was a sticker company and it was like Punk stickers.com and I was like I'm going to oh you had punk stickers.com you had that domain did I did pretty good domain um and then I lost it and I recently just negotiated buying it again but I don't know what I'm going to do with that uh we'll see um but the idea was like I wanted to sell stickers for bands and and make and also political activist stickers and there was someone up in but so I like looked up to these people that had I we go to like anarchus Book Fairs in San in San Francisco and stuff and like people were like all these selfpublished people that were writing books and Zen and so I had a Zen as well and I was like for like music related stuff and I was like I was just really fascinated with this idea that like there's I was finding a community people that were kind of kind of content creators selling like their Wares but kind of being a little you know just doing your doing it yourself and not wanting to work for someone else it was more like I'm going to go find my own thing and I think that was very much a an ethos of that era with like indie film you know was like people like I think I would like I would have loved to I just wanted to do something interesting and I what you know I thought was interesting and creative that I can kind of build my own destiny and not end up working my biggest fear was ending up in a cubicle in Silicon Valley I'm like that's my intive with computer industry was I'll be working in a cubicle somewhere there will be Windows way down a hallway um far far away and not that you know I I go to my dad's my dad worked in hardware and specifically in hard um hard drive manufacturing yeah and so I would go to the I would go to work with them every once in a while which I enjoyed cuz I would get this meet all these interesting people from all walks of life and people coding and and going in like the the the clean rooms and stuff and seeing stuff how stuff was built but there was but I was like there was something about that lifestyle for whatever reason I don't I don't know if I was like subjected to some maybe it might have just been like punk rock music and being just like rebelling and like I don't want to do what you want me to do dad which was probably to get a safe job in Silicon Valley like my grandfather did my grandfather worked at like he worked in Tech as well like was a traveling consultant and worked at like Atari early on and like so there's like I always had like that was like that was like my legacy of like this is what you're supposed to do and I was like that I want to go do I want to go kind I want to be a musician I'm going to make stickers I going to do my own thing um which I think was even like when I thought about being a painter and having my own company was more like I feel like someone else is making money off of my time why don't I just go do this myself and I don't know that I thought a lot about building a company that would have employees necessar so that was like that definitely cuz I I think I was always skeptical of people in power you know in leadership positions and so I think there was a there was a little bit of that and so uh which I think comes back to the how Planet argon started in the early years of I'm trying to think how to th thread the needle there because I'm kind of going back a little bit there but there's yeah but going to Portland was very much a hey I want to I'm going to go see if I can make it and do something on my own and ended up coincidentally my first job in Portland was a job in a cubicle doing tech support for a couple so you got a taste of like your your greatest fear essentially um just like like circumstance propelled you into a situation where you couldn't deny your destiny as an IT worker as a Dilbert character indeed uh exactly Dilbert character uh I was obsessed with Dilbert back then um but and then that show so during that period of time where I'm doing it support for about 200 people in the company and I started to you know basically a lot of going around help people fix their stuff that was problems on their computer um setting up new machines because we were hiring a bunch of people you know that's doing you know part of the onboarding and and and helping people upgrade their systems but people would come with a lot of similar questions you know things and I was like oh it'd be really easy if I just created like this I had already started making we pages and stuff like that for like my sticker company for my zen and some other like little personal projects and some for for some bands and stuff like that and so I was learning how to build some web pages because I wanted to my first entry into programming kind of like really doing anything like web based was like being able to I wanted people to make a request to order some stickers and so I'm like well how do I build a web page and so I figured out how to like I couldn't I was going to pay someone to build me like a form that could collect data from people and so I I learned how to maybe do something with like I remember if it was Microsoft front page or something eventually I learned how to do it in like with some CGI scripts with pearl so I was like just picking up some books I'm like how do I have like a form saved to like a CSV file or a text file and I can FTP that file down and see if anyone ordered any new stickers um and that that was like my entry into kind of doing a little bit of programming but it was because I wanted to sell stickers so how do I make that happen and so that those types of skills start to slowly start to accumulate so by the time I'm um actually at this job doing text support and I'm helping people I start putting together some web pages like on an internet um because I knew how to like spin up like a Linux server and run what what year was this approximately uh that job I moved to Portland in 2000 so that was like you know fall winter of 200000 um I was starting to do some of that stuff and so so that company you know they they were an event management company and so we did I was helping people do a lot of like CSV or Excel file dding stuff and like so I'm like here's like I could build like a little script to help out with some of these CSV D duping things I started making like tutorials where it' be like a bunch of screenshots so like here's how to set your out of out of office Auto repes so it doesn't create an infinite loop with someone else that also is on vacation that can be uh problematic that used to happen back then on email servers um but so they there was the company started to notice that I was doing this and there was another department of the company that was actually like a web development team for our custo like the company's customers and they're like hey why are you doing all this web stuff like why aren like that should be us that's doing they were kind of like a little bit like why are you so was like territorial a little bit and then and in 2001 they they announced some layoffs and then I did not get laid off but then they called me and do they're like hey if you want to keep your if you want to stay working here we have a role we think you could be a junior web developer for us because you're already doing some of this stuff so would you consider moving over to this other department and I was like oh I get to just do that stuff all the time and not have to go around people's computers and and like and like do I get to keep work and and you can get to keep working on the internet because everybody started to really like it and um that was a whole thing of like I remember them even thinking like it was like a new idea for them and it was only because I just started doing it and I was like ah I'm just going to make this to make my job easier and here's a link you can solve this problem yourself now um so I moved to the the web team and so personally I was like learning how to do some stuff with pearl and PHP but the company they weren't going to touch any open source stuff like that they were all using Microsoft um ASP back then net had I don't think it had just come out I remember going to the net launch though with that team but so they so during the day I was learning how to do stuff with Microsoft SQL server and kind of learning they're basically putting me on these repetitive projects where I was spinning up these like complex registration forms for these events and I would then go home and like well how do I apply what I learned at work today in this other technology stuff that I'm way more excited about which was like open source because it was all that open source World resonated with a DI iy mentality there was a lot of you know free stuff out there I could just download and spin up a website really quickly for some project for a band or for some activist project I was being a part of and so I I was kind of doing this like my Moonlighting thing was I'm doing open source stuff at night having fun with you know trying to learn how to Tinker with things and building my own projects and then uh and building some really really horrible like PHP minus schl things and if anyone really went down the rabbit hole and searched me on Source Forge you could find some probably embarrassing code there that was probably security written and should not be run anywhere but it was running at my company on their internet they would allow me to use the open source stuff for the internet stuff but not on our client work that was too risky um to go into that t but anyway so Planet argon started in 2002 as me saying you know what because I started realizing I was I was building up all the skill set and people started asking me like hey will you work on this project for my business like I have a consulting company where I do this thing and can you build me a website that I and I was like well yeah I can do that but but I'm going to I will only do it if I can build some functionality that you allow you to make changes for yourself like a CMS type tool or something so that you don't have to call me every time you want to like change some copy on your website um because I don't I don't want to do that you know yeah that's like the the first evolution as a freelancer is like you you realize oh no I'm these calls are never going to go away like exact there will always the updates needed made I need to figure out a process essentially of like delegating the change back to the client exactly so that's that's kind of how that the Consulting part started so 2002 is when Planet oron created as this thing and and coincidentally my partner at the time she was a designer and so so she and I uh girlfriend at the time we so we would occasionally work up on work on projects together and so the so the day like I remember sitting there in our apartment we were talking through like hey let's she already had like a design thing so she was doing design work with some clients and that would be like print and web based digital stuff like brochures and things that she would do and I've had this programming skill set and like okay maybe we can collaborate on some projects so I had my business and she had her business um but she was there the day that like Planet Aron started and like touched almost she did the first website designed my first business card she was there when we talked through all the different bit U naming ideas and before we came up with the idea for Planet argon and how that came to be own story but yeah yeah what is the story behind that so so I like uh so for a long time I would make it be kind of a mystery and I would always give this book to my employees I don't know if You' ever heard of the author um Tom Robbins by chance I haven't uh he's pretty well known in the Pacific Northwest he wrote like even cowg girls get the blues and there one of his books called still life with woodpecker and it's about an anarchist um terrorist coincidentally but and like an ex princess who fall in love with each other um and there's this whole he has anyways he the the main character is a redhead and there's the way the the the author is very Kurt vona esque in some ways but he'll have these like chapters where he goes off and these big random rants about or ramblings about things that are completely unrelated to the story but anyway I love this book when I was like you know late teenager and Planet argon there was this like Back stories about where like the pyramids came from was actually there's a theory that like it came from the redbeards which uh like redheads with their technology because they were sent away from this other planet sent to planet Earth because they were obnoxious human beings and so they were redheads were so went not visually seeing this conversation I I have red hair so plan discriminating against your own essentially uh Planet argon is where red heads came from According to this book as like a kind of like quirky little Side Story thing um because they were obnoxious and the people there did not want redheads there and I don't blame them we're we're horrible so anyhow interesting so so it's not Rel like because I think I've heard you ask uh in the past maybe on the your podcast like what's your favorite noble gas you'd think it would be argon and you know we've had I think maybe four or five phone calls or a company people trying to purchase argon and so i' always wonder if that was the business I should have went into but uh really like people people want to buy the actual yeah gas for industrial us maybe Planet argon sales argon uh no we don't but neon's my favorite noble gas like that just some cool stuff but argon I've seen some really cool use of it um there's a like a children's uh science museum museum here in Portland Oregon that they have a bunch of stuff in the show how different gases look and so there's some cool stuff with argon as well and so it can look it can look pretty cool I don't know a lot about all the noble gases admittedly when we had early on in plan Aron when we had when we start we have employees and we were offering hosting services and we had all of our own servers in Iraq all of our servers were named after noble gases and and it was like Xenon and argon and neon and so I have uh there there's yeah you run out pretty quick though you do you do so we had to like kind of like go a little bit outside of that and eventually we're like let's just we're we're running out of noble gases maybe we should stop doing hosting as a business anyways I don't want to have to touch physical Hardware anymore on than yeah yeah and um so let's talk a little bit about like the great middle because I think a lot of people create a consultancy and it's just them and maybe their significant other a few friends and it is fine and it provides a livelihood for the people involved but you've done something different in that you've stuck with it for a long period of time I'm I'm sure you've had lots of opportunities to go work at Big Tech and do stuff like that but but you've kind of stuck to running this consultancy and growing this consultancy um and I'd like to hear about the growth and how you managed to grow it and what what that process was like and maybe some of the pain points I I can definitely interject with the other questions I'm going to step back and just kind of hear what what were those first few years a growth like for you yeah well the first few years there was like no growth uh uh so 2002 is when I started as a you know the Moonlighting type of thing where I worked on some projects here and there um you know it was just enough to have to file taxes you know um but I was I still had a job you know full a day job and then I ended up working actually briefly at a another consultancy that actually got that worked in open source specifically and they're they were known for being experts in post Rescue all and so I was I went there for about a maybe a year and a half or so and it was like and that was was a pretty small company of like less you know there was maybe four or five of us consistently and I was like you know what I think maybe I could do this on my it was like again that like kind of like uh naive kid that's just kind of like you know at the time I'm like 23 thinking I could probably do this I'm doing all the project management I'm doing the coding like working with the clients I'm like I kind of get this I kind of understand and I'm like I want to maybe work with different some different technology tools so I I quit that so I can do Planet earon fulltime so that was uh early 2004 is when I officially was I'm out on my own um and to to to make plan argon work or not um the so here's what happens I'm doing that I'm you know trying to find work doing primarily PHP some Pearl a little bit of python work um and I was really excited about I think PHP 5 was coming at the time and it was going to introduce some more o related stuff into the language and I was like this is object fored yeah this is what I was uh kind of I was this is what I want to work with and and then I'm also I have a band I'm playing music at the time um and I was like I had been in a couple bands to this whole time as well it's another thread there but the I late 200 maybe like November 2004 I'm look I'm always looking for jobs on Craigslist because that's where you would find work a lot of time for like these Contracting projects so people would be looking for so i''d be scouring Craigslist in different major cities across the US people looking for like I I have this PHP website I need help you know and then I might get like you know 20 to a couple hundred hours worth of development work out of those contracts so I would just respond that's that's how I would def find work was like things through Craigslist and there might have been some other websites but that just one happens to be a top of mind and then one day in Portland there was an ad for this company that I was very well aware of called cdbaby.com oh yeah and Dereck sers yes so they were looking for a PHP developer here in Portland and I couldn't think of anything more perfectly aligned with like the DIY here's this person who started this business where it was helping independent musicians sell their CDs online because that's how you did it back then we you would literally like you make your CDs and you would send CD Baby a box of CDs and then they they would put you in their store and then they would handle the Fulfillment and the shipping and so they had a huge Warehouse you know maybe like four miles from where I live right now and I was like I knew that a lot of people worked there were musicians that worked in like the full field I'm like that sounds perfect I'll be a programmer I'll get to work with musicians I might make new bandmate friends or this might open up opportunities and maybe maybe open up doors for my music because I wanted to play music that that was really my dream was like I want to be like I want to make make it as a musician and yeah we haven't talked about that but it was like that was one of the creative Outlets that I really started to get into around that era of my life and so I emailed you know responded to this Craig stat and I applied for a job thinking I'll stop doing this Consulting work because I have to con I'm finding work all the time but like if I could work at CD Baby yeah I'll just stop doing this yeah so I didn't start planning thinking like oh it's going to become this thing I'm going to do for the next several decades it was like this is what I can do right now so I can get by pay myself but and maybe something interesting will pop up so I was so I applied you Derek quickly replied to me and he's like hey let's chat I he's like can I come to your house or come can I come to you and we'll have like a little kind of informal interview so we did that he he came over to my house one day like you know in the morning around probably around this time of the day and he had I remember he showed up with a he had stopped at maybe like Whole Foods or something and showed up with like a big little plastic container of pineapple and he was just eating pineapple 900 in the morning I a bunch of it and he's he was like I made some tea for him and we chatted for a couple couple hours about programming and kind of him getting to know a bit more about my background as as a software developer he's like oh this is interesting he's like I'm talking to a few people and then like the next week I went out he had me over for another interview went out to their warehouse we had a couple more conversations and he essentially verbally offered me the job he's like great because here's the deal Derek at the time was the only developer that had ever worked on any of the code there he was looking for his first programming hire that would basically start to replace pretty important take over for some stuff yeah and to fix the you know invariably you know Hodge fge code base exactly and for this operation that was running really successful he's like I have to focus on other areas of the business now I can't be just head down as in COD code all day so he verbally offers me the job he's like and it's I think this is maybe late November early December of that year he's like let's he's like I'm not ready to like start you before the end of the year let's let's let's connect in January I'm going on vacation after January we we'll we'll reconnect and talk about next steps and I'm like great I'm going to go work at my my dream job you know a 23 24 year old kid um then this happens uh comes back from beginning of January he's like hey can we have a quick chat make sure he's like so change the plans I'm like what he's like so I got stuck in a blizzard um during the holiday break and I had this book called programming Ruby U it's a famous book in the programming world it's like it's a pi it's called the pickaxe because there's a pick like yeah the pi book and he's like I and there's this thing called Ruby on Rails I want to do it all in this I want to rewrite everything in this like I'm so excited about this I love rub like I'm so excited about Ruby I want to redo it he's like but you don't know Ruby yet I'm just learning it I found a guy that lives in San Diego that knows it's already on the court team this guy named Jeremy I'm moving to Portland to help me rewrite everything and so he said if you can pick this up I'll hire you then so so dream shattered take a moment being like okay that's it is what it is it's not the end of the world it's just like okay I get it I had also heard of Ruben ra about a month before i' watched the video there famous like video about like creating a Blog in like 15 minutes or something I was like oh that SS interesting so I was like all right I'm going to start playing with it and start like kind of getting into it I'm like kind of excited about it I'm like well and there's a carrot if I could pick this up and get good at it and understand enough like I'll go work with you know Derek and this guy named Jeremy you know in in northeast Portland at this warehouse and work in Ruby I'm like that great there's a job I I think there's a job here I could pick this up you know so I start diving in more Ruban rails and there's not a lot of documentation because it's new and I have to like figure out how to look under the hood and make make sense of things and so I started like well so that I can remember this I started a Blog I called it Robbie on Rails um and I started blogging very very regularly um and like modifying my own blog tool and I'm working on you like start teaching like showing like how I'm doing things I'm like I had started working on this one project um called my band spot which was like going to be a CMS for bands to manage their own websites because it was something that I had built in PHP for a couple of bands in Portland and I was like oh I'll rewrite this in Ruby and Ruby on Rails and then I can show Derek look I'm I'm I'm learning all this stuff anyhow that kind of Ruan rails that it's like hard to compare it to anything else they seen maybe and like AI has been its own interesting thing in the last years but I feel like with new technologies that come in and just like change the trajectory of like the community like so quickly Ruby on rounds at that time was just like it w it's it's hard to really explain but it was it it it just made our life so much better as a software as software developers that it basic B became this thing because I was blogging about it these startups started contacting me and being like hey will you work on our project for us can you help me build this thing because you apparently know about it because you're talking about it you know on your blog and so my Dynamic of me scouring Craigslist looking for PHP jobs and competing for like you know I'm trying to ask for like $50 $60 an hour and other people like well I pay this one person 15 can you can you meet me at 25 and I'm like yeah how much do I need to work this week um to all of a sudden people asking me hey can you will you work on our project with us I have this new startup idea and so that stuff started picking up more work like that people people were coming to me and I also part of it was like another thing because it wasn't just that I was just blogging Planet argon also because I was I always wanted to work with new versions of technology and and be able to host that easily I felt like a lot of cheap affordable hosting was always going to be like way behind on what version of PHP you could use so I remember when PHP 5 came out I offered shared hosting for PHP 5 people people that wanted so if you're a developer you could do that or you wanted to use the brand the latest version of postresql here's an environment that you could do that with and so you know a month and a half into me really diving into Ruby on Rails I started offering Ruby on Rails hosting to people and so I started getting interesting so it's just a server that was configured to already have a lot of that stuff running so you could like multitenant or whatever exactly Multiplex uh a lot of clients on the same machine yeah this was before we had like virtualization being like super common and things like Zen uh xn at the you know came a couple years later basically I just knew how to set up like there was some open source stuff for managing shared hosting with PHP stuff and I figured how to change it so that it could also like spin up a ruby environment for people so people could back then you would just include all of your you know your your gems as part of your repository like your subversion Repository or a c CVS or whatever you're using and so or you would SFTP your files into your this home directory that you had and like I just would everybody would have their own database running and and stuff like that so I just learned how to like I could fit like maybe know 80 to 100 customers per server um and because none of the projects were that big in terms of traffic like they could all kind of coexist and and it worked out okay um and then eventually if you wanted to spend more we would make you know we put you on servers ahe had less customers on it that you were sharing space with and that's that's how that model worked back then but that so I had those two things happening I was blogging and I was with the hosting stuff and then companies started contacting me to be like hey will you work on this project people also asking me hey would you interview for a company you know you mentioned like getting approached by you know opportunity so you know maybe fast forward four five six months um Derek from CD bab is like hey you want to chat again I'm like my my my my my situation had changed you know quite quite a bit I was like oh I'm actually I just got a book deal with O'Reilly um and be weird for him like you go from like some long shot like maybe this kid will actually learn it and to having like an authoritative book uh or blog and and a you know potential book deal with O'Reilly which you know at the time was basically the king makers yeah of the tech press essentially like if anybody was an expert like like having an Ry book meant you were like the definitive expert qualified to write on the topic what was what was going to be your animal you know on what's your animal cover uh did they let you choose by the way no um and and that's a whole another story but book never got finished because the company grew too quick and so that point I turned around the job I said Derek I'm like I'm going to see where this goes um and people were approaching me and maybe there was still kind OFA I didn't really have employees outside of it was me and and my kind of like my cofounder who uh who was starting to get more involved in some of the projects that we're working because there was a lot more design involved it' like start a project so we were she would design stuff and I would build stuff and so we were doing that and we're just being I was being very active in the community there was no Ruby there was no rails conferences or anything that that that was like a year later before those started and so it wasn't like speaking engagements outside of like the local so where was the community I mean it was people reading your blog were people like on IRC yes IRC yep was meeting lot of people through IRC because so people you know Planet argon had we had a IRC channel for for people that were hanging out because they were customers and they would all like help each other we had our forums we had there was the Ruby on Rails Channel um and then there became this kind of like little back channel in the rubyan rails Community um called The Caboose because it's kind of like the back of the train and we were kind of like the this became this like little hodge podge group of people that were were kind of early adopters through rean rails and kind of people that were maybe more businessyoutube exactly you know he's just you know he's working on you know selling snowboards on on you know on the internet and stuff like that and um so we were all like helping each other in this back Channel like kind of like basically it was just because it was just like a subset because the r on Rails channel would be like hundreds of people and this one made maybe be like 30 to 40 people there's a photo of us somewhere on Flickr like at the first rails comp in Chicago where everybody that was around for that photo like that was like a big group of the people and that was like the first time a lot of us got to meet each other in person um so it was just like that Community was definitely IRC based and blog based um we were all kind of like referencing each other's blogs we used that was back when we would have like a little list of other blogs you recommended people reading you know like I for what what we call that but kind of like a web ring typees thing and um and there was someone that um kind of you know looking back at that early that first one or two years of Ruban rails like someone was there was like a Ruban rails blog site it was kind of like an aggregator that kind of brought all these like blogs you bringing all the RSS feeds into one that was pretty popular it might have been like Planet Ruby and rails or something and at like after like a year there was some Milestone and and then they announced like who was the most prolific blogger in the ruband RS community and like I was like twice as many blog posts as anyone else that year wow and because I was just sharing what I learned as I did it and um and that so a lot of people knew me as Robbie on ra stuff like that so that opened up a lot of doors and then later in that year so this is like fall 2005 this is when we grow couple large projects get come my way one of them is by a design company that had a project they were doing a winter Olympics project for this small shoe company that's based in um Oregon called Nike and they were their headquarters here and they were working on a couple projects for nanki one was the Winter Olympics and then there was also going to be a World Cup website and they wanted to build this backend system and they were like excited about using Ruban rails we were like the only people I was like one of the only people on the west coast that was like actively doing much Ruby on rail stuff at the time and I knew these people in their local Ruby user meet meetings that I would go to and I was like hey this project is too big for me can't do you want to come help me do this because most nobody was getting paid to work with not not very many people were getting paid in Portland to work on Ruby on Rails like they were curious about it or even to work on you know just program with Ruby in general but they like to dabble with it it was like they like their hobby thing you know they were getting paid to do like I remember so I ended up kind of recruiting maybe seven or eight people and they were working or like an office attic bought some like folding tables and some chairs from used furniture equip like office furniture um store and all of a sudden it was like eight eight people working in the Attic on these projects and I was like I don't know what happening but I'm like let's just see where this goes in worst case um this doesn't work out for more more than a few months then I just go back to working for myself or I'll just go talk to these companies that keep wanting to maybe hire me so that's when we became an agency was it was it was very quick it was a big project so so you had eight devs yeah like basically like and then did you feel pressure to go out and pound the ground and get business to be able to support those devs well at the time I was turning away work wow so you you could literally put all eight of those devs productively to were were yeah they were they were going to be busy for the next few months because there was a couple projects I mentioned those Nike ones there was this other startup um and I remember I our estimate for that yeah I mean Nike like maybe the biggest Portland company yeah um to get them as a client early on that's that's definitely a feather in your cap well we were subcontracted through a designer to be clear Nike I do not think they would have hired us directly um we were probably way too small they did later we did work with Nike for many many actually still kind of work with them now but um we're almost wind it down with them but we we Nike was one of our was been one of our largest clients over the years so um eventually we were mature enough of a company for them to take seriously but the um but yeah during that period it was like we had enough work for people so they were basically hir them all as contractors um in like maybe October November that year and then and then towards the end of the year we're like all right well let's let's take a real look at like it was a so proprietorship at that point so the business model like the entity so so you had liability yeah so January 1st 2006 we became an LLC and then I offered all those people jobs employment jobs and most of them took a job that meant that they were going to get to work with Ruban rails and that's what they were in Ruby and that was exciting and there was basically just the people that I knew locally that were excited about it I didn't it wasn't I don't remember any any other way of thinking about how to weigh them up if they were going to be good people to work with if they were uh good employees so the interview process was like kind of nonexistent because you just already knew them yeah I just met you know I met them a couple times at like the the local Ruby Meetup maybe we we you maybe we got a you know coffee or had lunches together um maybe grab a drink or something and I was like I'm just going to throw these this rag tag group of kids at the I want say kids but we're all like in our you know probably mid 20s at the time I was like let's just I just let's just see what happens and worst thing as I go back to doing we all go back to what we were doing right yeah and the thing that I knew I felt like I had some at least a skill set was because I had already had a couple you know years of doing the Consulting work that I knew how to at least like do a little bit of negotiating I knew how to do think about the sales process and knew that I needed to spend time on marketing and promoting the company and reconnecting with customers after you wrap up a small project like a few months later to see what else is going on so you can get recurring work with you know like I that was so so maintaining that relationship and and having it not be a oneoff but uh you know a an iterated game so to speak exactly and the and meanwhile I felt like a lot of the software Engineers that had been experienced with they just wanted to work on the code and they were really excited about the tech itself and I think back to what you were you know we were talking about earlier in the conversation where I was interested in what it could do for a company so I was like I felt like I was in a much more natural I mean I was super excited about playing with Ruan rails and everything but I was like what can I do with this what kind of web apps can I make for people what kind of business problems can I solve look how much quicker we can build this thing for these people and it was also an overlap at the time with like a lot of like web design and ux improve improvements in maturity I think in the industry where there was like a lot of patterns you can pull from web standards browser you know things that were happening it's just like a web standards being as that was like its own thing the fact that we were even geeking out about like HTML and CSS consistency as a industry was like that overlapped at like at just the right time that it just made I think Ruby on Rails came in and so all new web apps could use these new patterns and so they looked and felt better and for users and so like I feel like it kind of just all got bundled up into that thing like oh rubben Ra's applications feel better because you're using all these new standards and so there was kind of this weird thing where like because you're using these new standards you care about the end users and that's going to make better for your business and and look how much nicer things are yeah versus these clunky web apps that everybody would be throwing together because it' be a bunch of software web developers designing the interfaces quite often and they were just like they weren't great they were just making it you know doing their best and they weren't really thinking about the design side yeah and I think bootstrap came out like shortly afterward and was pretty widely adopted by the r on Rails Community as well and that that kind of standardized and removed a lot of the decisions that you had to make as a developer um yeah and that's like really the strength of rails in my humble opinion is the convention over configuration um just like this works well enough let's not split hairs and so while a lot of people might have been like um you know saying oh rails is not high performance or enough or I needed to do specifically this thing you were just getting down to work building stuff for clients exactly it was just I I you know it was a little bit of a David Goliath battle too back then it was kind of like look this is kind of Underdog thing we're like coming through and we're like no we can build really sophisticated applications with this technology that people were like skeptical to say the least like this isn't mature it's funny because now you know 20 years later or whatever uh it's I feel like we're having similar conversations like oh ruon RS is like this old thing nobody wants to use it anymore it's too mature too mature and like we go back to when I used to have I used to have to have conversations with large companies that like someone at their company had heard of rubben like I really want I'm they were like really proponed like we want to build this web app for this internal thing but I need you to help me convince the CTO that this is a safe decision this is not going to like ruin us somehow or going to plague us with security things or just we're going have to throw so much Hardware to keep this thing running I mean were you doing a lot of like full codebase rewrites like Dereck sers was asking or were you just building new functionality out with rails a lot of it at the time early on was new functionality new web apps um and the I think it probably took about a year and a half two years before we started getting calls from companies to help them come in and repair their existing Ruban rounds applications but there there was a couple projects that were were rewrites or kind of modernizing their existing platform a bit so like maybe there's a part of some web app that they were using like hey we want to put we want to build a new interface for like there was a company that worked in travel and they wanted to build a new interface for travel agents um that could interface with the same database so one of the things that I was kind of you know air quoting known for in the community was being a big post rescue y person but also being understanding that there's a lot of Legacy I came from a world where remember I mentioned earlier my previous job I was working at a company where we specialized in post and I I had a the database to me was like always like this thing that never assume that you're not going to have you're only going to have one application that interfaces with that you may have multiple things that are interacting with it so I always felt like a lot of business rules should be in the database which was like a hard Paradigm for me to wrap my head around when I got kind of adopted Ruby on Rails for yeah because you're doing like migrations in code essentially as opposed to structuring your database in a specific way and then adapting your apps around that existing kind of schema right yeah well technically uh database migrations didn't exist in rubs when I started using RS uh you saw you all of our first scheme is you had to do all your write out your SQL create table statements alra table statements that came in maybe a year two years into rubian rails after I started using it and I think probably help I don't remember if they adopted that from somewhere else but it was definitely like a big game changer but it was more of the you already have a legacy database that has some different application how can we make a ruon rails application work with that same data set and make maybe new reporting tools or some new interfaces on it so I was writing a lot of I wrote a lot of articles in some Library ruby gems that were for like working with Legacy databases so you can put active record and have it connect to some um like Microsoft SQL Server thing or an Oracle database or some old MySQL plus database where the DAT the naming conventions are wildly not what we would consider normal in the Ruban rails Community just like a different way of doing it so so but then you can make it feel more rails likee and so get the benefits of building web apps quickly with rbrand rounds but still getting to leaning on an existing database and having to work around database triggers or store procedures and how do you make that work within the rub rub Ruban rails world and so that was like a part of my I guess my Niche was because I had that skill set and I was like how do I work around and still get to use and leverage ruon rails um so we would get pulled in to help out with companies that were trying to have like a hybrid system there's a lot of companies sneaking rails in on this very small thing and and like their dream would be like and then eventually we'll show that this works like a trojan horse eventually the whole comp going to Mo rails but we have to prove out the concept with this exactly so that there was a lot of like that type of work that came kind of came our way as well and then over the years we ended up realizing that a lot of our typical clients that were startups they would not be our clients you know two years down the road because they didn't figure out how to make their startup work right and so most startups do not uh get product Market fit they don't get traction and they are not able able to raise subsequent rounds um yeah yeah but but obviously Planet argon from a sustainability standpoint is is going strong I mean you're like almost 22 years in at this point uh how big is your team now we are I think approximately 14 15 people at the moment um it's funny like every time I get asked that question I don't exactly know I have to look at the slack Channel um it's always like kind of weaving in we do bring on contractors here and there as well we've usually got a couple interns um so that numbers in terms of working directly with with clients and like I guess selling the clients is that something you do a lot of yourself still yeah I do a lot of the business development at the company so I'm usually one of the first for people that companies will talk to and kind of like help make sure it's a good fit for the company we're not like a large enough company to really have in it's interesting people always talk we invest in like we have a marketing person that helps out with our marketing but when it comes to Sal sales uh there's this interesting thing because the type of work that we focus on now is more on helping organizations that have already invested a lot into their rubyan rails infrastructure and platform how to help them modernize that how to help them like do some refactoring projects or we are their primary development team because there's a lot of web web apps out there where a company might have had a small development team internally build or maybe they worked with a small agency or a couple of Freelancers to build some internal tool but it wasn't like a it was never intended to be a thing that they were going to have consistent fulltime software Engineers working on they don't and they're not really set up like they're you know it's you know they're a travel company and they're like what we don't know what to we don't know how we would keep like two three software developers busy fulltime right so they have these apps that need support and but they need more reliability than say just working with a freelancer and so we're kind of like in this space of like you maybe for aside from the companies that have their own engineering teams that use us to help them with make some upgrades and modernization type projects or refactoring uh we're kind of in this interesting middle sphere of like where when you outgrow like your Freelancers but you're not really thinking you want to grow into having your own fulltime team we end up being so so a lot of our companies were on regular retainer with them where they are basically reserving time with us every month for us to keep an eye on their application to respond to bug fixes error alerts performance issues and they always have a backlog of feature improvements and updates that they're looking to make and so we're we're their team you know and so we so our our developers are working across multiple clients like in a given week so it's a little bit Contex switching but they're all it's all ruby and rounds for the most part and so we're just like so our business model kind of went from working with startups and helping them estimate out their you know their product Market fit and hoping that they figure out how to sell this thing and so that they can get more budget in the future to keep investing to now we're like hey you already invested in this thing you know you need to continue investing in the upkeep of it and keep things updated and um and we're not afraid to roll our hands you know or or roll our sleeves up and get dirty on older applications because a lot of projects come to us and they have not been tended to um in years because they're like well we had a couple people work on it and then that person left and then someone came in and they never upgraded it and now 5 years has passed but we you but 30 people at our company use this application every day we need to know that someone can take care of it so since we've been around forever we've seen all flavors of that over the years and so we can come in be like yeah we can stabilize this and work on a plan to help you upgrade this and interesting so so a big selling point of uh getting Planet argon to work on your uh your code base it sounds like first of all you've been around you're not going anywhere so there's that peace of mind associated with like Hey we're going to get these people up to speed on how our code works and they're going to be able to continue to maintain it uh for a longer period of time and it's not like a freelancer where they're going to um move or um just change careers or something like that like that a lot of that risk is mitigated and at the same time it is a lot less expensive than having your own you know developer staff just maintaining that project and and in in many cases sounds like a lot of these uh particular projects are not such that they would warrant having uh a bigger team no and and I think I think some companies fall into a trap where I've speak with some developers like yeah I'm like the solo developer on this project for this company and I've been working here for a decade and maybe five years ago they had a cooworker another developer they have they have coworkers but there's like but like a peer you know what I mean and like I can't kind of see where you're go is this is the tacit knowledge Time Bomb basically like they walk out the door and like suddenly nobody knows how anything works exactly this this story is like one of the most consistent thing this is where this is another one of the so it's interesting I'm actually helping a company right now and so I'm kind of like in a weird way I get one of our service offering is kind of like it's you know Under the Umbrella we do Consulting right as well and but a little bit of was like um like business I want to say family therapy for teams of like you know I will you know it's it's it's almost guaranteed that always like once every 6 months I'm going to get a com we're going to get a call from some someone that works at a company that maybe has 20 to 50 employees and they have one software engineer that's been there for a really long time and they're like hey we have a situation we've either there's enough work that we tried to bring in additional people and people leave and they cannot work with this person that's been around forever and this is right they come in and they're like great I'm going to come in and be some you know New Blood on the project and a year year and a half later they quit and they're like I can't work with that person um but then they're like but that this person has been so dependable for us over the years and we're really nervous about losing this person but but maybe it's time for them to go you know and they're in this weird situation like can you come and help us assess this like can interesting so almost kind of like U you're you're doing like a uh like a case like a a briefing you're you're going in as the investigator to like try to understand the situation and recommend courses of action yeah or just like can they help them understand can we survive if this person were to leave you know there's always like people talk about like oh what what happens if someone gets hit by a bus you know why we document things and this is why documentation is important and or why we re reate automated tests so that we know that if someone new comes in they know that they're not breaking everything well that sounds great but also when you're a really small team the reality is if no one's reading your documentation and you you're able to keep a lot in your head you start you start making concessions on what things like things that might help a healthy development team work and flourish you like well you deprioritize some stuff and you continue to do that and then people come in and they're like Hey where's the documentation like well you know I've changed this thing six times and no one's ever looked at it so I just I haven't maintained it in Forever you know like the read me file hasn't changed in five years and you're just like okay I get it I can be empathetic to that I understand how that happens when you're working in an environment where you're putting out fires you're being reactive to like hey you're keeping everything running and you're like kind of like thinking about someone spinning a bunch of plates at the same time you know and it could be a lot of work for one person to oversee the whole system but if there's no one to collaborate with consistently whether it's because of you're doing because you're just not great to work with or because you don't trust that other people are worthy of being part of your team whatever this situation is um or there's just not enough budget to warrant mult multiple people to be to work with you uh which ends up being quite a common thing you know this this kind of problem will resurface and so then the companies like what have we invested in or we screwed if this person walks out the door but also maybe they need to leave they need to leave and so for whatever reason I think I can come into those situations and and be fairly neutral I understand how the developer gets there I understand how the comp or the business owner might be really concerned about this and I can like I can talk with these people and kind of Na you're kind of like the Rockstar Whisperer almost a little bit but you know I'm trying to not use the Rockstar thing too much uh they usually just come in in like trash hotels and leave and um but it is it's it's an interesting like come in and maybe I have enough I'm well known enough in some circles that people give me a benefit of the doubt that I'm not coming in and just like telling someone what they want to hear so I mean do do people see you and like panic because like oh no no they they brought him and that must mean I'm like on my way out or no or like are you often able to like repair the situation or or just by introducing a collaboratory like discourse are you able to fix a lot of the uh kind of like documentation not getting updated tests not getting written things like that it's a great question the I've had some successes I've had I'd say the companies have had some failures with trying to correct the situation and where where it works out for everybody it doesn't always end up working out for everybody in some of those situ and I don't I do not believe I have a reputation coming in and like help helping people lose their jobs um I think I'm much more on this side of probably much more on the side of like helping people keep their jobs and maybe making some incremental changes but the people have you know it's like a it's in some ways it's like getting pulled in for like a you know like a physical therapist you go in and like try to get some work done and they show you all things you're like oh great I do these stretches every day this will be good for me and this will this pain will go away you know and I know that if you don't do the work consistently then you're just going to end up at the you know the physical therapist in five years and they're going to like you're like oh yeah I remember I did this before so there is a lot of like people need to want to change some of how their approach their work and stuff like that and so that's that's the thing I'm you know I've been you know coincidentally in the last couple years things that I've been doing is first professional development is taking a lot more curriculum related to improving my coaching skills like okay I'm I'm a coaching these situations how do I better talk with these people get them to think about their and help them solve their own problems rather than me being super prescriptive and like I think you should do it because this is what planet argon does and if you just do this it'll be great for you everybody kind of needs to figure out come to some of those aha moments themselves right um and which I think was also an important thing to learn early on as a consultant especially for designers that if you I always felt we always when we've had designers on our team if they work on working with a client on a design I honestly believe that I've seen way more success if the if the through that collaborative process of a designer working on things that if the designer can help the client feel like show them how their ideas is what manifested the current version of the design versus like a designer going away and coming up back with some magical representation of what they thought they heard the designers that always felt like made it appear that it was actually so much of the client's idea and they just materialized it like that's to me like an effective consultant effective coach is like helping someone see come to this kind of like realization and kind of coaching them that way and and also being aware enough to like that you might not know the best answer and you got to find something that's going to work well for them I'm not saying you're manipulating them but I think it's more of a there's a there's a strategy there I think that can be yield better results collectively so the um so when in these scenarios around coming in and helping helping out things it's a lot of like a strategy that we'll kind of take on um is doing this right now for one company where you know I'm participating sitting in a lot of their meetings and taking notes asking questions asking the dumb questions I always like let me ask a dumb question I said that if you say that like a bunch people disarms people pretty quickly I think um because then you can ask the questions you really want to ask but um and not have to rely on assumptions but like start thinking about like if you if we come in like show them that we're going to use the documentation like hey we want to like one exercise will be we want one of our developers to get your app up and running in their local environment um and like maybe a goal would be how hard is it to bring in someone else to come into your team get acclimated to your system your repo or multiple repos and be able to deploy a small bug fix maybe even just change the footer copyright date or something on your on your web app how painful is it for a company for for someone to come in and do that that because I feel like changing the date in the footer if that takes several days to be able to get to that point like is that unless you're bringing on regular people maybe that maybe not be the biggest concern but if you're a company that's concerned about like hey feels like everything's slowing down I feel like those are like sometimes symptom of that and like you can look at those types of how hard is it to do some really small tasks and people can come in and so I think if you can start removing like addressing those things you start to highlight a bunch of of other pain points that makes it difficult for people to come in because a lot of those companies that are calling us they're not just calling us because they're like hey help us better understand the situation they are truly calling us because they're like hey things have you know like our product backlog seems Log Jam things like our delivery time is taking forever I I'm starting to lose confidence in my team's ability to estimate when we can release something so that means I can't promise our customers that this new feature is going to be out by X because I just don't believe it anymore because it's like we're almost there we're almost there and then like months pass and they're like can you come in and like can we hire your team to come in and help us build these things but they're like they also know they like I don't think it's going to be that easy they know like you can't just throw more people at the problem it's like how do what's going on here what can we do to smooth the process and onboard new people so that other people can contribute to this project and I think if you have a piece of software regardless of the framework you're using if if it's difficult for other people to come in and work on it I honestly think that that's not a a good good sign that you have a great software developer I feel like that means you have a developer that's keeps everything in their head and that's that's not it's not it's not the end of the world especially if they're like in personally invested in their company but if they're an employee and you don't really feel like you can trust someone else to come in and take over for them yeah that's that's a concern to me and I always I remember thinking I remember we had a project manager once who was so organized with how they Pro like their process it was so consistent and how they documented everything they did I was like you're making it so easy for someone else to come in and just take over your job and they're like and that's why you keep me and I was like aha that's great that's a great it's it's very much counter to the intuition that a lot of developers have like by not documenting things like I've got all this proprietary knowledge in my head and uh it's my uh I guess my retirement plan is is like carrying around a whole bunch of details about the code base and uh and not you know writing those down anywhere that's my job security so so you you found it to be the opposite like companies will actually acknowledge like oh because this person is so transparent with everything that's a that's a strength it it should be seen as a strength it should be seen as a strength but is it seen as a strength by a lot of managers or do a lot of managers be like oh well we can replace this this person really easily with like a you know a cheaper developer just out of college because they've documented exactly what they need to do does that kind of transparency hurt your longevity at an organization to some extent that's a that's an interesting one I you know I was speaking with someone recently uh because one of the things we also offer now is recruiting uh as helping companies hire people because I know a lot of people in the industry that may have jobs that they like but would be open to talking to someone and so I'm like I am pretty well connected I can try to connect the dots and maybe I can make a little bit money on that introduction but aside from that um I talk with some people and they're like I got asked what's your opinion on uh how long like a 10 year how long of a 10e developer should have at a company and they had and this was from a like a pretty seasoned software engineer um that's been at a company for maybe like five years as a engineering manager he's like a he manages a team and he he's heard from other people in the company so he's in Engineering Management but he's heard from other parts of the business leadership that there's a curiosity about how long should we keep developers because if we're not cycling in new people and getting new fresh ideas one we might be getting stagnant but two um May maybe there's a competitive thing with salaries you know maybe we can hire people further away or whatever and there's other things there but like so he's like he's like he's like have you heard a lot about that so admittedly I don't feel like I've had a lot of conversations like about that that that was a recent conversation I had and I was like oh that's interesting because I've always think it's be great to have say for a long time but sometimes I do think from like a growth perspective if you depending what people's if you as a software let's just assume most people listen to this or software Engineers is your goal to be at a company for a really long time or is your can build like a longevity and like have uh make a mark for a specific organization that I mean I come from a maybe you know a couple you know a slightly different area where like the idea of working at a company for a long time actually sounded good to me when I was young I'm like oh I don't want to have to switch jobs all the time and like like hopefully I'm not like losing my job or getting laid off on a regular you know every five years like that I think that maybe in some ways me thinking I'm going to do my own thing was a way to avoid that because he would see that play out and still my dad worked at his last job for like 25 years you know yeah what about your grandpa he check he that's a good question I don't I don't know how I think he actually did a lot more job hopping because it was early on when like he was like he at least he moved a lot like the family moved for work a lot and so I don't know if that was like maybe the manager he worked more in like management maybe that was the manage track in the you know the 60s of moving like they go to their Minnesota then they moved to Illinois and then they moved to California yeah I mean I definitely have heard from older folks uh you know my grandpa stayed at the same company basically his entire career as an engineer um you know my dad has run his own practice with like similar partners for right most of his career uh it's it's pretty um common for like people from that they were born in like the the 40s 50s 60s to just stay at a place assuming that they can get a good job and like this definitely holds true in Asia for example in Japan like they have the whole company man notion like you get a job at a company and and ideally you stay and there's like the social contract where they teach you new skills and you keep getting promoted and additional responsibility how do you feel about that like do you think that that is a good fit for most developers that you know or do you think most developers do want to be changing a lot uh I I wonder if it's a I don't you know it's such an interesting thing I think you know for me you know I've been doing working at plan Aram for such a long time now you know like it's funny plus years and I'm like there's a part of me like is this where I retire I don't know the answer to that I don't know like do I still have a business in five years is always running a Consul consultancy is a complex mess of like es and flows and hiring people having to lay people off if there's down ears and stuff like that it's it's just a cycle and then but but at least I get to kind of control the narrative to some degree at least I feel like I'm slightly in control at times most of the time not but you know I think about when people are work for the general software engineering like if you're I'm just wondering if there's a certain element of like do you I I wonder how it's going to impact us when we're for for people that are in the industry and are and are employees somewhere and aren't maybe not in control of it I honestly think that the thing we don't talk about is age as very often as being probably one of the most common biases of you know things that we're discriminating whether we we want to talk we openly mention it or not but I do think I we talk about diversity in Tech but you know rarely do I see a a lot of startups where you'll see some older people in the company you know working there people that are in their 60s you know getting hired and and I've been in part of those conversation like ah that person's like it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks and stuff like that they're not going to like so there's a interesting challenge there I think if people maybe I think some sometimes people will find that themselves having they're kind of stuck in a job or feel like this is this a Ive space now at their their last 10 years of their career because they're maybe nervous about rejection trying to put themselves out there and I don't know how this is going to play out over the next several years you know le as I as as I get to continue to get older um you know there's kind of these weird phases we get through and like sometimes people think that like I'm not up to date on the newest things and like what are these kids in their 20s doing nowadays and but where's that kind of where's that where does that go at some point when people are feeling like they can't get a job somewhere else and so might they stick around just for fear of rejection or or because they've been rejected and like well at least I have a stable thing so I'm just going to sink in here and maybe my opportunities are not going to be drastically there's not going to be a lot of other growth opportunities whether that be salary or promotions but like I can at least stick in this is kind of my area that I can control and there's I'll stick here until I retire um a lot of startups probably aren't they'll talk about retirement plans but do they think long term about like what's a 20 30 year 30 year career look like for someone at their company they're still trying to figure out how to make the next few years work let alone think about that far they can talk about we've got great benefits but you know I mean like startups are going to get acquired there's going to be all kinds of creative destruction the notion that you could get a job at a startup and still be working there 30 years from now I think is probably not realistic for not you know in a majority of cases but a lot of that is because developers tend to work at a startups especially over here on you know the West Coast where you got you know you got Seattle with all the startups you got San Francisco and uh you've got uh you know the Bay Area with all the startups I I do think that like if you go to like a more traditional kind of like industry like banking or hotels or you know um hospitals or any like i' I've heard the statistic that like twothirds of developers work outside of proper Tech and I think in those roles you know it may not be so unrealistic to just work at the same company Long Term but from your experience working like What proportion of the companies you work with are tech companies to Planet orgon how would you define what a tech company is Quincy yeah so I would say a tech company it would be like the product is some sort of like app or software tool like at last is a tech company they have you know this Suite of software tools you know Salesforce is a tech company is you know Ford a tech company I would argue they aren't because they're a car company they may position themselves as a tech company but like that's just a very small aspect of what they really do which is Source parts from around the world and design cars and you know make sure that they meet all these different regulations and stuff right so the tech part as much as they may emphasize that is actually probably a pretty small proportion of the number of people on their team that are doing just that I mean you could argue like Finance is Tech but it's not really Tech in the sense that probably a very small minority of the people who work in finance are software Engineers same thing with like media and other Industries like that so I I I would say very specifically like tech companies like Microsoft is a tech company you know so so I I think I would reach for that Common Sense kind of definition of tech and not um not like a marketer type definition of what constitutes working in Tech no that that I think that's actually a really good way to kind of frame it I I think the thing that I I struggle you know I've talked about this in the past on some other podcasts and stuff like that I've always struggled a little bit with tech because I felt like it was too encompassing I think we kind of overuse it like oh we all work in Tech because we're all software Engineers I'm like well you know you you work in finance right or you're work in healthcare you got to think about Healthcare regulations like you know yes there's some software within that healthcare related company but it's is that it's it's just an interesting I guess you're using Tech to solve some problems I suppose but I feel like I was like is is the is your skill set as a software engineer just that you're really good at knowing how to code um solve problems with software code or that you know how to solve problems in that specific domain you know and you buil up that skill set and so like if someone's working at a Healthcare company and they want to go work at a Banking Company you may may not want to put like you can talk about all the health healthc care stuff certifications you might have and all but you're probably like I understand certifications and compliance type things that would make it I'll have to learn this in the finance industry but I can figure it out but I don't I'm not going to show up day one knowing all of that and but so I think you could you know if anyone listening is like domain expertise from working in a specific field as opposed to like nobody has domain expertise in tech tech is kind of like the uh implementation detail through which the product is created I can I can speak a language uh well there's some people at the company they need to speak this one particular language yes I can do that um may not be like but can you talk about these other Concepts and the this stuff in the domain so I think that's you anyhow so your question was how many like What proportion of your uh clients at Planet orgon are what I would narrowly Define as tech companies in the sense that they're creating software products um it's interesting uh even the companies that I'm we've definitely worked with a lot of tech companies over the years I think right now it's probably in the range of like 15 20% of our clients okay okay so so that that kind of matches with the global like the actual like us industry is Tech is just a small part of that right yeah um so do you think that uh a developer going to work for like one of your you don't have to name a specific client but like what do you think the chances are that a developer going to work for one of those clients would likely be able to work for 20 25 years and you know get the the gold watch and get the retirement and all that stuff I don't know if that stuff really still exists anymore but but basically be able to save up enough money that they could actually retire at some point like and and that they don't have to be careerly jumping from job to job just because it pays like 10% more each time and and that's the strategy of course many developers employ conventional wisdom is if you change jobs every 18 months or so you're going to maximize your income over time by by doing that and that if you stay in your current job you're less likely to be able to get AR raay because you wield less bargaining power because everybody wants to stay their job they don't want to have to go through the gauntlet every 18 months of trying to get a new job right true but like what proportion of those clients do you think that like people could realistically plan to work there indefinitely you know I mean you take like take Nike as an example like that is definitely a place people can can persist for a long time um the it's interesting because I think there's a lot of uh companies are that we're working with where they're a lot more distributed now and I think that sense of identity in organization and the remote world is hard for me to wrap my head around in some ways like we're a remote company now we weren't up until the pandemic and interesting so you let your lease go we let our lease go you know we had but when that happened we had already talked about maybe downsizing and maybe having s hiring people a little bit further away not just focusing on you know because basically we were 90% of our team would always be based in Portland and so I was like who are the best people that we can afford in Portland Oregon you know who do we move out here we would move people um you we move people here maybe two years before the pandemic we'd moved them to Portland you know and so and we'd also have to think who else is opening up shop in Portland airbnbs you know setting up an office and are they potentially now a competitor for our talent you know um because they use Ruby on Rails for some of their stack at the time and so those are the things you used to think about in a location based thing so I'm thinking about like company people sticking around at a company for 25 years 30 years and in a remote world I'm just like there's a part of me I like have some trouble wrapping my head around what that looks like and the sense of like longevity and getting that go you know like and there's there's been companies that have been able to do that for you know the last couple decades I'm just not as familiar with them I don't have a lot of reference points I'm just like yeah because there's another part of me it's just like it feels very you know like it seems like everybody that works to plan enjoys it they raid us well we got you know awarded you know one of the best places workplaces you know it's like this online thing last year and I'm just like but but it feels different for me you know just being completely honest I'm like this is a really different thing era for me or I'm trying to get R my head around how do you bond with your team and what is what is what is it what is what is it that you like because we don't have I'm not able to make you waffles on January the first first the first day first business day of the year that was always a tradition like how do we we don't what is it about some waffles in like one of those uh those boxes with the dry iceers something the probably would very good waffles so I think is it's an interesting thing where I'm um to answer that question like I have no clue like and I'm not going to pretend that pretend to know I'm just like will people want to work and sign into someone's whatever in 10 years whatever the equipment of someone's slack is and every day and chat with each other for like at some point you're going to want to chat with other people I don't know so yeah I mean who knows maybe we'll have teleportation or something like like or it'll just be like trivially you know easy to get around the world and we'll we'll figure it out some sort of system that doesn't emit tons of carbon every time we get on a plane who knows uh but uh yeah I I can definitely see like remote work throwing a a wrench in like longterm planning and and like our intuition for team Rapport we're fully Re remote free C Camp and we've got about 30 people around the world working on the open source code base and working on instructional design and uh you know like we we meet for you know one 30 to 45 minute slot each week and the rest of it is just kind of ad hoc meetings and stuff and how do you build rapport well you know we're flying people into Dallas to to hang out for a while What proportion of your team is in Portland though now let's see there's what four so there's four of us here now um two of them we hired after the pandemic started um so only one person because my business partner moved out of moved moved out of the area during the pandemic so um so yeah we have one person that was pre pandemic from Portland that's still with us so we've just had to get used to a cycle of constant change so I think that also speaks to why it's harder for me to wrap my head around plus long term there and like now I'm thinking more of like there are certain types of business entities we can we have had clients that we've been working with for you know 8 to 12 Years yet we've been able to show them that we can have Engineers on our team come and go and we can manage the projects keep continuity and persist like some collective knowledge about how to keep these projects running and stuff like that so that's one of our so there's a now A Thing part of me it's like longevity is important with employ I want employees to want to work here as long as they are but also 10year length is less of an emphasis now I think because I'm just like this might be a really good opportunity for someone for a few years you get a lot of experience maybe at some point in their career we're either really good place for someone early on in their career as a junior developer to get exposed to a lot of stuff that could be really valuable to them and we're also a good place for people that are further along in their career and they're maybe they've seen a lot and they're like you know what I want to apply some of the skills to a broad range of problems and I can bring in all this knowledge I have across get to work with lots of different projects Now versus just working at one company so that's kind of our our recruitment strategy in some ways now is like we can hire both ends of that and like the people that are kind of in that middle part of their or early middle like ambitious part of their thing we're not we don't we're not set up to like have lots of promotions we've got like a couple tiers yeah um and that and we can't keep raising our hourly rates at the same rate that your salary range wants to increase go work at that startup that's getting funded and can offer those other things like what I promise you is you're going to get we're only going to ask you to work this much a week we're going to work on different these types of client projects it's going to be a little messy you're going to need to be okay with that but you're going to get a lot of exposure to things and we're not going to call you on the weekends or in the evening to work on things unless there's like a really big fire that we need your help with otherwise we just want consistent stability and we want to do good client work and enjoy the rest of our what the other projects we've got going on in our lives yeah I mean that's a huge selling point for an employer to just be able to say no we really mean it we're really serious about you know the 40hour work week and not having to be like patched in constantly on slack or whatever right um so yeah cudos you for uh figuring out kind of like a proposition where you can compete with you know companies that have way more money to throw at developers um one of the things that you know strikes me talking about uh longevity in careers is you know maintainability in software and continuity in having that code base that's been a core focus of yours and I'd like to shift gears a little bit and talk about the maintainable podcast excellent podcast which I've enjoyed listening to before I do I just want to point out that earlier I joke that teleportation might be possible in like 15 years I just want to say that I think that's probably the least likely technology that we'll have and I don't even think we'll have teleportation in the 24th century when Star Trek is happening I I think it's it's such a hard problem that I doubt it will actually exist so that was a joke for all the uh physics people that are listening in uh the doctors all the people out there that are like the philosophers um thinking that I I don't want them to walk away thinking that I think teleportation is going to happen anytime soon so um you've done 160 episodes of maintainable 160 episodes so you've really you know maintained that podcast and you've optimized for you know longevity in that podcast what's the core focus of the show consistent conversations I think is part of it a consistent formula the the the way I look when I started the project there was a couple things you know you know useful to mention about how I think about approaching new projects like when I started that particular the podcast but how I think about projects in general now um but I knew that I wanted to have conversations with people that I felt like would hopefully still show to be relevant and valuable in then you know 10 to 15 years after the conversation was had and so I wanted to have conversations with people not not about what's new what's exciting what's the newest trends I mean that stuff occasionally you know trickles into the conversations you know like teleportation we don't talk about I don't talk about the future and stuff as much and um mainly because I don't know it is and I'm not g I'm not a good predictor of these things but what I do know is I've seen a lot of consistent problems resurface regardless of the technology platform I also wanted to have conversations with people that are not specifically you know I I'm I'm a Ruby on Rails software engineer was Robbie on Rails think that's my company's core Focus for the most part we also do some react and some other stuff I don't personally do much react maybe written like 20 lines of react code my whole life um it's not the it's not the thing that kind of excited me because again I'm more excited about what can I do than what I can do you know what the the technology itself was and we already had enough client work to keep me busy working with Ruby and rail stuff so the so when I did the maintainable software pack podcast I want to have conversations about what were some good different people's perspectives on what it meant to be a to maintain your software to what it what wellmaintained software looks like what it feels like what it's like to work with it on a regular basis what's what is it like to join a project where there's already a lot of existing code because I think a lot of people in the education because it's just the way it ends up working sometimes is that you you get to learn how to build new things what when you you get introduced to programming and again like I we talked earlier at the very beginning of the conversation it was like hey if you write all this code you can play this game but it'd be like what if we could modify it how do we make how do we update it how do we improve upon it how do we make it easier to develop with how do we remove developer friction that stuff is the stuff that I'm most interested about because I felt like Ruby on Rails when I was interested like it removed a lot of friction made a lot of decisions for me and It produced better easier to build things but then it didn't prevent problems from occurring still within teams knowledge getting lost documentation problems um how we think about testing and how we have conversations about technical debt and overdue upgrades and how do we work with people that don't understand what tech de Tech debt is or do we even use the word Tech debt yeah let's just describe Tech that very quickly like two sentence explanation of what that is for anybody listening who doesn't uh understand that concept yet yeah this is a question I ask almost every one of my guests and it's very rarely consistently the same so if even my definition is going to be my version of it so I see Tech Deb is um the things that are that have accumul like kind of we use this metaphor because because it kind of goes back to like you you get debt and you pay it off is kind of like you know in the you know when you're getting a loan for something and we've kind of we've taken that and maybe stretched a little further in our industry some you know I don't think I like to use the word technical debt but I like to talk about it in the sense that it's it's I think the best example of it and it should be six two two sentence I'm not doing a very good job at that uh defin this is why it's I think it's why I love asking the question is it's hard uh to answer clearly because it's I think of it as like the you've made some intentional decisions or maybe even subconsciously decided to forgo something to get something done now but you're probably going to later going to need to later come back and revisit something but maybe something's good enough for now or you've said this is going to get this this code change is going to get out the door but you know we probably in you know down the road a little bit we're going to need to go back and revisit this thing because this is not going to scale for whatever reason and so there's that where's that balance between is it is it a debt or is it just like a concession that you made a tradeoff it's kind of like I think tradeoffs is maybe is a better way to frame them sometimes but I think another way to look at is like you can go to any team you be like what are like ask every developer on a team five things that are causing you friction in the code base or things that you feel like we're we should have changed a while ago everybody can probably sit down with an hour or two and make a good list of five things will they all match I don't know um but that might go into a technical debt backlog and then there's kind of Maintenance work that needs to happen so you're building new features and occasionally you need to go take care of some like overdue behind the scenes updates refactorings upgrades you know migrations is from one search engine tool to some other you know fulltech searching tool what whatever the thing might be because it doesn't it's no longer being supported or it's you know it's going to be a problem down the road so it it's kind of like was not a super clear answer but basically like you're kind of debt financing getting things now yeah and you are going to eventually have to pay the piper so to speak and uh fix those things if you want to have code that continues to work one one thing that I want to make sure everybody listening to this realizes that that I think a lot of people may take for granted nondevelopers and developers who are just getting into the field it's just how quickly software starts to break down there's a craft an important part for teams to figure out how they're going to regularly it's like when you you build a a a physical building and no one's kind of confused about their needing to be regular upkeep on it right and so I think it's we talk about I want to have this conversation with a lot of with with our industry because there are times where we build things for whether you're you're working on a part of a team or maybe if you work at a company that's founded by probably some people that understand software you understand this but I work with a lot I've worked with a lot of companies over the years where they build something and they're like What's the we need an estimate buil to build this piece of software and so someone built it for them and then they're like great thank you we got we need talk to you later and then they're like hey there's a bug like a month later like what do we do about this there's a performance issue or this weird Edge case so there's like regular okay we need to spend money on we need to invest time developer time into just taking care of those types of requests but they don't always realize that there's all these other little things behind the scenes that they're not requesting or their users aren't requesting but are just like hey look there's new versions of things there's security patches that have come out um Apple has their own chipsets now and the version of Ruby that we were running on is no longer supported or no one's compiled it yet for that and so if we get a new our developers get new laptops all of a sudden we can't spin up the application we need to upgrade Ruby and we need to patch things out in the production servers what have you there's security patches that need to get deployed so all these like little things that need to happen but your team needs to have like a cohesive workflow for regularly taking care of that stuff you can automate some of that stuff now with some tools but you need to take care of that stuff and there's but there's still a lot of things that are just more like code Centric things that like oh we designed it this way because that was the pattern that was kind of invogue at the time two years later we're now we're starting to see that we're having to work put a lot of workarounds because it's not quite we didn't quite use it the way we thought we would maybe we need to revisit this part of the application to simplify it or there's a lot of companies that you know there's a lot of conversations you know 10 years ago about let's all move to microser like you know let's break everything out into lots of microservices because then everything's kind of these bitesized pieces and it all fit together and it won't matter if the microservice isn't there our team is scaling like crazy we're hiring 50 new Engineers every six months that's what going to keep happening so this will be the best way to keep everything kind of scaling for us and then fast forward 5 10 years and they're like the team's now 20th of the size and responsible for the amount of microservices that a team that was four times as big generated and they're like this is too much for us to keep in our head heads and what how do we manage all this stuff and so that becomes a maintenance problem and just like thinking about as your the decisions you're making at different points in the life cycle of a software project can come back and haunt you and and I want to have those stories and let people know that they're not alone that these are common things and also to remind people that most of software engineering isn't getting to be there day one to spin up the new application and get to build the new features a lot of what being a software engineer is maintenance work making small up bug fixes figuring out the quirky performance problem trying to understand why something was working in a really weird way retesting things and so that's the conversation I'm trying to have with guest on maintainable awesome yeah it's a great podcast and uh one question I had for you is like just off the top of your head for somebody who's totally new to listening to the podcast who's been doing software development for a while wants to be learning more and thinking more about maintainability of their code and of their their company's codebase and everything is there a particular episode that just jumps out at you is like oh this episode like I'm so proud of this episode you know it's a good question thinking about a couple that come to mind you know you know this is this again this is over almost five years of episodes 160 episodes yeah um so for that sort of like early on you know I'm thinking of Sandy Mets oh yeah as is one was one of my favorite conversations on there very famous rails developer yeah and rubius and objectoriented programmer and just like hearing her talk about like oh I'll just be in a in like a ruby object in a class file in a ruby thing and she's like I just start adding more classes to the bottom of the page and I'm just like what are you talking about um it was I learned a lot from that conversation um yeah that's one that quickly comes to mind I'm include that uh link to that in the show notes the video description on YouTube uh everybody check that out I I am also going to include do my shell which is just this fantastic article that you wrote many years ago and and you actually came on the free Cod cam podcast and read it uh Episode 34 uh back in 2018 uh so like instead of trying to drill deep into the story of Zell om my Zell and uh the open source you know boohemoth that you have set into motion uh I'm going to encourage people to to listen to that but one thing I do want to talk to you about is the Synergy uh you have this very popular uh one of the most ubiquitously used certainly on Mac uh tools uh command line tools and you also have this podcast about maintainability you of course have your uh Robbie on Rails blog that you were updating as of you know four or five years ago um and and of course you've got the consultancy planet argon and I wanted to think about like how those have those kind of like Voltron together to create like the ultimate like lean mean like Robbie Russell publicizing machine over the years like like do people come to you and like oh yeah I'm a huge fan of om my Zell or I'm a fan of the podcast like does that resting client work for you all you'd think you know I get this from a lot of people and they they're surprised to find out that it it doesn't really I can't say that like a lot of my clients probably give a or even know what the hell om Zell is occasionally I'll be on a call with a client and they might have some engineers and then they they they might know who I am or know about omz shell um and and so they'll come like oh I was talking with some because it's usually someone in like a different department it's like I'm working with someone like in some logistical part of some company and they're like this like this manufacturing company and they have like a fulfillment center and they're I'm talking with someone there and they're like hey we have this thing built with rubby on RS blah blah blah you people showed up in our Google searches and seem to be reputable um so I feel like we can talk about these things like I also have a podcast or omell is another thing so the thing that I I think it's helped the most though is we do get ref referrals you know we get referred from peers in the industry so that does end up being a way that we've gotten some of our projects over the years um where it might be Freelancers or some other agencies that are deciding to no longer be an agency or they maybe they got acquired or interesting so if an agency is going out of business so to speak then they'll they'll kind of like pass on their clients to you they try to like help them help rehome them it's like a natural thing like you want to if you have a long relationship so sometimes that they have like one or two big clients and they're like well this is something they've been working like we have we had a client that came to us or a company come to us a couple years ago with a large client that they'd work with for like 15 years um a couple different Technologies but they primarily use Rand rails and they're like yeah like the owner of the company had some health issues he's like I'm retiring closing up shop and this isn't like I want I want to put them in good hands and you you seem like you can probably carry them the next 10 years can you be that company can we can we trust that you they'll be in good hands so that stuff that that occasionally happens and so if you're running an agency you think you're getting out of the you know call plan Aron anyways uh but as far as like that the the other part of that the you know it was funny this last year I went to um a conference in where was it it was in Amsterdam called rails world and I was there I was I I I interviewed the rails core team that hosted like a panel discussion like an AMA thing that I I ran and I I I was meeting people there that knew me for omay Z shell and they're like why are you at this conference like why why rail it's interesting so so like you got your om my Zell like super user fans and then you've got your rails blog fans from back in the day and then you've probably got lots of people who you just just know you from your work argon right like so it's almost like they're like three different kinds of Robbie Russell fans yeah only like connect the dots no they don't connect the dots and so I was like at the rails conference I'm passing out omel stickers to people and I love that I mean it's like and like a lot of people like I didn't know you were a ruby developer I didn't know like I'm like I'm like I'm like oh Mya wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for the ru and rails Community like all of the original ideas came from other rubyists and I shared it with my Ruby on Rails community and they shared it and GitHub was written you know was written with Ruby Ms and it was one of the first big siiz project open source projects on GitHub early on and it's all kind of like connected in this weird way but like you know fast forward 10 15 years and actually yeah I think om Zell turns 15 years this September August or something so which is wild to think of that that's had its own lifespan but it's not but it was it came out of like a rubyan Real's developer working with his coworkers and wanting to have some consistent uh shortcuts and little tricks up their sleeves to to improve their their their efficiency and the command line yeah yeah awesome well congratulations on being able to interview the rails score team by the way that's a really cool honor yeah so we're getting toward the end of the podcast we've been talking for a while and we we've covered so much but I just wanted to delve a little bit more into your you know very interesting personal life like I don't have a lot of guests on here who are in a post rock band and you know play guitar and do sets and release albums and and they've been doing that for a long time maybe you could take a moment to just talk about what post rock is uh for the uninitiated and like what your particular band uh how you all approach it and maybe what the name means like a what is aula is it just like like a place or oh um so the band is named The Mighty moua Missoula okay moua I didn't pronounce it correctly it's a place right uh there's a place called Missoula Montana in the United States uh which is named after something else uh as well so so first on the name the the mighty Missoula is a reference to many many many years ago this before most of us were in on in before there were a lot of humans there trying to remember how many years I forget how many years ago it was there were a series of large floods that swept across the Pacific Northwest and helped carve out a lot of like the Columbia Gorge which if anyone doesn't know but the Columbia river goes Cuts between Oregon and Washington and quite a bit of Washington state is is like a massive um River and so there were floods that were basically started because there was this uh glacial Lake in where where is now like modern day like Montana where is this huge glacial Lake and it like I think it bursts through about 12 times and just would flood all the way almost all the way to the Pacific Ocean like that's how massive of a lake it was that it would just sweep across and so drastically impacted the a substantial portion of you know the United States was underwater at this point flooded you have any idea what like geological ERA this was like double check it's the um this was during during the end of the last ice age okay so and so when so the the band it's called The Mighty Missoula and that's a reference to these floods one of the ideas was like the Missoula floods or something like that and we thought that was too obvious so we went with the mighty missula and people could ask us what the name meant and we like well there's these floods it's a GE geology nerd type thing um because and it kind of shaped the Pacific Northwest um landscape quite a bit there's lots of areas you can see where where the flooding impacted there's debris and like huge rocks in the middle of like areas that do look like why is there a huge Boulder that's like 50 feet tall yeah how did I get there um because it was it was a rock and a big flood anyhow um the so the mighty miza is we're a post rock band in like we're basically we're instrumental kind of art rock band and post rock is a genre of music that's you know it's funny now it's like it was trying to be not kind of break some of the rules of standard rock music and try to like let you you can just like drone on about things and not have to follow a lot of super consistent formulas for how you write and produce your music it can be more ethereal atmospheric um I like to think about the music that I listen to when I'm working whether I'm writing code or I'm emailing I don't like to listen to a lot of music with vocals and so a lot of music that resonated to me and like early on in my you know think back it's funny music ends up you know being this like thing that you can connect to certain periods of your life like um I remember listening to like a lot of Boards of Canada and which is not um postrock but you know there was mostly instrumental yeah similar drum stuff qualities in terms of being something you can kind of like listen to in the background and it's yeah you know like the ambient of the 1994 everybody called that ambient back then right and then it would just feel like I guess like Apex Twin s ambient Works to ambient right exactly and so there's so like bands in that realm if you know couple of bands like sear Ro is kind of considered a post rock band um explosions of the sky from you know from down in Texas where you're at um MW Gods Speedy black Emperor you know I was listening to a lot of this stuff in there you know like 2001 2002 um got to see explosions of this guy the very first time they played at some small Club here in Portland Oregon and I was in a goth rock band at the time this was probably yeah maybe 3 and two or so and went to the small club and saw them CU I found their music on Napster or something and went to go see them play and I remember thinking they're a band without vocals how interesting could that be and I went there and I was like this was like one of the most engaging shows I've ever been to I was like just enamored by what was happening how I felt with the music and I was like and I was in a band that didn't really like my singer all that much and the drummer or the bass player and I had talked about like it'd be cool we always like when we're just jamming on stuff before the rest of the band gets there and we start working on our music like like just noodling on things like let's start our own project so I my first post rock band was back then it was called the vacant we did that for a couple years and then Planet argon took off and the Bas player she got pregnant and our lives kind of went a different direction and then so for years I wasn't really playing music but um about I think maybe going back like seven no probably like nine years ago now I think I was like looking at my equipment and occasionally playing with my guitar I was like I need to collaborate with people again and and so I didn't feel like I was progressing personally by just playing like I'm like oh I'll work on my own music and right stuff I play a couple different instrument I can't do drums or anything but I can at least make some interesting ambian type music with guitar and some bass and stuff like that and some synths and such but I was like no I want to work on a project with other people and like let's see what comes out so posted out on Craigslist you know found a drummer found a bass player over appear time start putting together a band we you know we start writing some songs we pick a name we record an EP and then our drummer moves away for for journalism school I have to find a new drummer and then like he has different skill sets can do a lot more recording stuff as well we our skill set drastically improves our WR songwriting evolves write another album then the pandemic happens we're stuck at home we during the pandemic we were we our album release so we printed vinyl we were releasing our album April 2020 we were planning like our you know launch show you know album release made vinyl we were super proud of this thing we're like we're going to put together a tour that summer we're all stuck at home um okay maybe not and so then during that period we IID wanted to work on some more ambient stuff like let's strip away the drums our drummer can do a lot of s and and soundscaping type stuff so like we we all stuck at our home so we decided we would make an ambient album and we would pass files around the cloud it was all cloudbased themed um so we did that as a way to continue writing together and build up some new skills during that period and that way we knew that when we got back together post coming out of you the the next album that we're working which we just finished recording a month ago and we're now in the the final mixing stages right now so that'll be released sometime this summer um so that was pretty exciting and last year we got to go play a festival in the postre f in Indianapolis so we did a tour across the country to that and back and played a lot of shows with anywhere from four people in the audience to you know several dozen you know type of thing to playing at the festival with like hundreds of people there and that was pretty exciting but yeah it was it I'm kind of I kind of look at it as like it's it's a hobby I'm not this isn't going to be my career by any means who knows but it's kind of like a little bit feels like cosplay sometimes um like it's like we're banned we're we're doing this fun stuff but like it's a fun hobby and and it keeps me you know out of the house a couple days a week to go work with other people on and it's not my project it's our project I might have posted the original Craigslist ad and so I think in some ways I'm like the leader a little bit I have that project management skill set but I'm not but it's our band it's like yeah do you ever have to like kind of like suppress your manager I mean you're a CEO so like you're used to like figuring out what needs to be done and like listening to everybody's opinions and then making a decision and people are expecting to go along with it that that doesn't really work in your band though right like is it more democratic or or are you somewhat autocratic it is it's it's a lot more democratic sometimes we'll have conversations like who cares the most about this particular decision there's you know I gu like our our drummer I mentioned has like a lot more he went to school and he has a background in in uh Sound Engineering so like things on that realm we kind of defer to him to help make a lot of decisions and kind of guide us and teach us through it but he also has a really good knack for being a good producer which is you know and and that's and someone that can help unblock us or help like when you're recording something in front of other people and you're trying to figure it out it's like I think I think about music I think everybody has this idea that you write the music and it's all perfect and you're going to play it the same way every single time and it's like that's not what happens I just watched Quincy do the uh intro song like three times um and they all sound a little bit they all sounded great three different times um different ways and that's that's the way it works so like sometimes you're kind of like you don't remember how you did something or it doesn't quite feel the same when you actually go to record it and and like someone has an idea like no do it the way you did it originally and you're like I don't and there's there's a performance aspect as well it's like sometimes I want to play the Baseline just like it was on the record but maybe mechanically like I get tripped up by some sort of like jump or something like that yeah and uh yeah so can't reproduce everything and yeah you don't necessarily want to that's why people are you know still bootlegging grateful Day concerts uh I mean how many concerts have they done and there's probably a recording of pretty much every single recording and fans will listen to all the different versions of like very similar kind of like I guess and jazz is an entire art based around the notion of having like kind of like a motif if you will and then like diving into you know jamming essentially it's true the um it's just that's the thing about so to answer your question yeah I don't feel like I have to put my CEO in hat very often I mean I'm usually the one that's like over looking finances for the band and like dealing with some of like the the paperwork when we're negotiating some stuff for like a a festival or shows or something like that but um but otherwise yeah everything else is very collaborative and and and I kind of like let them drive a lot more of some of the songw writing I might have like some guitar ideas I have and but they're definitely I'm surrounded myself with people that are much better musicians and so I get to kind of grow with them which is a thing that I appreciate about like the types of projects that I do like you mentioned omell the thing about omell it's like I might have planted this flag once upon a time that here's this kind of concept and the structure I have and then and immediately I was like please contribute and now we've had over 2,000 people contribute code to the project and so I'm just like it's it's become what it is because of the people that decided they wanted to participate and they felt like they could and maybe I made it easier for people to contribute in some way or at least made it inviting and that that's helped you know after we finish this I'm going to hop over to an omell maintainer meeting with the two other people that help maintain the project and I've never met them in person yet actually hoping to do that in a few months actually um but it's just like I I just Sur and that's why I don't I didn't like being a consultant an early era Contracting thing you know outside of my you know I mentioned my partner that was a designer we would work collaboratively but I didn't really get to feel like I was up leveling as a developer because I wasn't really working with a lot of other peer developers very often just kind of like figuring things out myself and so I felt like I've excelled the more that I've leaned into working on projects that involved other people to help get the thing done and other skill sets people that were better programmers or deeper programmers in certain things and there was Project managers and there was a designer and there's and the collaborative aspect of working with the client or other people to bounce ideas off of and like to review my code or for me to review someone else's code that's that's the world I like to live in and so like we'll talk to a lot of people that are Freelancers and I'm like I don't understand that that world like how you've decided that that's the thing you want to do I'm like what's wrong with you why don't you trust people U I'm kind of jokingly saying that and and it's like but what what is it that you're like I want to just go do my own thing and maybe and that's like an interesting thing for me to wrap my head around because that doesn't make sense to my brain but I um so even though I thought I wanted to DIY it it was always about like I wanted to do my thing but I didn't think that it was going to become this thing with employees as soon as I had that around me I was like oh how could I do this any other way this is way better yeah well so to some extent your DIY spirit is like a victim of his own success a little bit Yeah Yeah well uh I just have one closing question uh because you know Portland seems to be like a really key aspect of your life you know you chose to move there you've stayed there much longer than I've ever lived in any one city um and if somebody's going to Portland for the first time what is something they hands down should consider taking a day to do if they're ablebodied to leave Portland and go out to the gorge and go on some hikes or a hike somewhere there's a couple great gr hikes feel free to write me I'll give you a list of a couple things depending on your I would say your ability to threshold of how much pain you want to endure or not um so that I mean there really like so much of like the thing I love about Portland is so close like 30 minutes away and you can be hiking in some pretty gorgeous areas um reminds me that early on there was a rails conference we we we shuttled a couple buses we rented some bus charter buses and we took a bunch of Ruby on Rails developers hiking one afternoon as a way to like let's go do this and like let's show you outside but if you're in Portland one thing that I would do like inside the city is honestly I think just like you know it's like cliche to like talk about if I like wandering the coffee roasies and getting to check out different coffee shops and stuff like that something I enjoy doing in any City so maybe it's I feel like that was more of a thing more of a Portland thing early in the air and so I still think about that which kind of just got me excited when every time I travel now I'm like I want to go find the coffee roaster STS and try coffee but that was more I feel like that still leans on being kind of slightly more of a Portland origin type of thing so I think checking out some of those old coffee roasteries is a thing and is there a specific Street a specific Street where like a lot of them are collocated or no they they're all kind of around now um like the what ends up happening is like the places that are on the the more popular streets they might turn into chains and then it depends like I don't want people to judge me because I'm like oh Haw ha's ha's still cute um but I'm like actually I don't know if any of the roasteries there are the like actual roasteries over there right now so they're all kind of like scattered a little bit okay but Hawthorne is like a destination that a lot of people might like if you're a total Portland novice and you're just looking for a single word remember Hawthorne it sounds like is uh get hop in the the taxi take me to Uber uh take take me to Hawthorne and stuff on it right exactly that and Andor uh and then hit the pals on Hawthorne but if you have time go downtown and go to the big PALS like that's still our our independent bookstore there is PALS huge so definitely spend hours there awesome well Robbie it has been an honor to have you on the podcast again everybody who's listening to this be sure to check out Rob reading of uh his St my Zell uh article uh which I'm linking to in the show notes also check out that Sandy Mets episode of maintainable and uh I'm going to also link to one of your recent live sets that I found on YouTube uh from the mighty Missoula um and uh yeah thank you so much for coming on thank you for maintaining om my Z shell which like I think most of the people on pream team use it probably on a daily basis um and uh thank you again for just being so so giving of your wisdom from running a consultancy the past 22 years and all the lessons you've learned and being so candid this is really means a lot because people can this is like the unvarnished like implementation details of running a to right yes I don't have a uh I don't have a a publicist to help me figure out how to better frame my narrative and thank you Quincy thanks for having me on thanks for everything that you and code Camp are doing um thanks for introducing for being part of the reason why I've met such a good friend here in Portland Abby through Abby editor for free code Camp uh you've almost certainly seen her work even if you haven't directly read an article by her I need to pick up that book uh getting things done as well I'm excited about that new book on freeo Camp press check it out uh Omar rosenbom wrote he he is a git Enthusiast to say the least he writes like a 300 page book on git so that's wonderful check that out yeah until next week everybody happy coding
