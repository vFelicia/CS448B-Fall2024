00:00 - real tough candy from realtofcandy.com
00:02 - back on the bike with you guys today
00:04 - how's everybody
00:06 - today we're going to talk about the five
00:08 - secret weapons that help me learn to
00:10 - code better you guys know i don't like
00:12 - wasting time let's get to number five
00:14 - number five books we understand the
00:16 - power of a great udemy course
00:18 - the great lecture style that team
00:20 - treehouse has
00:22 - some of the code samples that free code
00:24 - camp has but there's something about a
00:26 - book i don't know about you but when i'm
00:28 - on a computer like i'm doing a udemy
00:30 - course or whatever i have like seven
00:32 - other tabs up and i'm getting distracted
00:34 - all the time and a book just minimizes
00:36 - those those distractions the other thing
00:39 - about books is that the topics are
00:41 - indexed so you can very easily flip back
00:43 - to whatever you're trying to learn about
00:45 - if you really want to double down on the
00:47 - secret weapon of books
00:48 - pair them with a video course
00:50 - because you get the audio of the video
00:53 - you get the visual of the video and you
00:55 - also get the visual of a book and it
00:57 - really reinforces that information
01:00 - number four a mentor i was lucky enough
01:03 - early in this youtube thing to have
01:06 - someone actually reach out to me this
01:07 - guy's a super talented developer he
01:09 - checked out and he has been so helpful
01:14 - with me coming to him with for real-time
01:16 - information and real-time help when i'm
01:19 - stuck on a problem
01:21 - and mentors mentors are great when
01:23 - you're learning to code because you can
01:25 - come to them and they make you feel
01:27 - comfortable it's not like stack overflow
01:29 - where there's this peanut gallery just
01:31 - waiting to rip you apart for asking a
01:33 - newbie question and i still have him as
01:36 - a mentor i have my job but i'm still
01:38 - asking you questions um about work stuff
01:41 - when my senior developer is busy or just
01:43 - on the weekends when i run into
01:45 - something but real tough candy where the
01:46 - heck am i gonna find a mentor i don't do
01:48 - youtube chat i don't have a freaking
01:49 - youtube channel that is a perfect
01:51 - question to segue into secret weapon
01:53 - number three
01:54 - tech communities the irl the best irl
01:58 - groups to get into in my experience are
02:00 - meetups you go to meetup.com search for
02:03 - your technical interest whether it's
02:05 - javascript ux ui
02:07 - you name it it's out there they're in
02:09 - most major cities um even around the
02:11 - world these meetups take place and if
02:14 - you live in a rural area or a smaller
02:16 - town
02:17 - make a point to go to that city once a
02:20 - month or whenever you can every couple
02:21 - weeks and just make those connections
02:23 - and don't be shy about introducing
02:25 - yourself because they're people of all
02:27 - talents there's a lot of people out
02:29 - there who really want to help newbies
02:30 - because they remember how frustrating it
02:32 - was and a lot of people just like the
02:34 - challenge you know it gets them out of
02:36 - their comfort zone online communities
02:38 - are super diverse and can be very
02:39 - helpful as well uh free code camp has a
02:42 - great community the real tough candy
02:43 - getter chat room there's newbies there
02:46 - are seniors there's people who've been
02:47 - doing it for 5 10 20 years plus and
02:50 - these online communities are great
02:51 - places to find that support get the
02:54 - questions answered that you need
02:56 - answered and progress in your learning
02:58 - in your career
02:59 - number two
03:01 - in achievement journal this is a lo-fi
03:03 - method to track your progress and really
03:06 - just flip the pages or go through your
03:08 - digital notes and see how far you've
03:10 - come
03:11 - you know you're delving into so many
03:13 - technologies and coming to a lot of dead
03:15 - ends getting a lot of success points in
03:17 - there too but after a while a lot of it
03:20 - just kind of like melds together once
03:22 - you start writing things down you can
03:24 - start organizing your thoughts and that
03:26 - organization that decluttering of your
03:28 - mind
03:29 - really makes
03:31 - learning and retention of information a
03:33 - lot easier i keep a journal at work i
03:36 - have something you know there's like
03:37 - to-do lists i have a to-do list so i
03:39 - have a physical journal with a to-do
03:41 - list and sometimes i'll keep notes on my
03:44 - personal machine as well
03:46 - and you can just use something as simple
03:48 - as you know a little note program where
03:51 - you date it and then you just give
03:52 - bullet points on what you accomplished
03:54 - that day after a while after a few
03:56 - months of doing this you're going to see
03:58 - some big time progression and that can
04:00 - be a huge confidence booster and a lot
04:02 - of times confidence is what you need to
04:03 - learn more and keep pressing on to
04:05 - practice these technologies and feel
04:08 - confident in applying for jobs and
04:10 - getting to that next level
04:12 - and finally the number one method for
04:14 - learning how to code
04:16 - go for a walk
04:17 - go for a bike ride you like gardening
04:19 - get out and garden
04:21 - go get some physical activity where
04:23 - you're not focused on a computer and
04:25 - coding one of the quickest ways to burn
04:28 - out and just get sick of it and just
04:30 - stop learning is by staying on a
04:32 - computer for 18 hours a day our bodies
04:34 - weren't built for it and our brains
04:35 - weren't either i mean the more you try
04:37 - to stuff into your brain the less you're
04:39 - going to remember it doesn't have to be
04:41 - this hardcore thing where oh three hour
04:43 - bike ride followed by an iron man like
04:46 - it can just be 15 minutes
04:48 - but it really is important to just take
04:50 - a little break from the computer from
04:52 - coding and let that information process
04:54 - and again going back to writing in a
04:56 - journal getting your thoughts organized
04:59 - i've had a lot of revelations about
05:02 - coding problems just taking a walk going
05:04 - for a bike ride being out in the woods
05:06 - thanks for watching guys i'm gonna go
05:08 - run over some more pine cones
05:10 - go get a fizzy water maybe go get a
05:12 - kombucha or something oh yeah i'm living
05:14 - it up
05:21 - [Music]
