00:04 - hello hello
00:06 - hello hello everybody
00:12 - we are going to get started here
00:14 - momentarily
00:23 - we're just going to wait for people to
00:26 - filter
00:28 - in
00:30 - and i'm going to get a chat window up
00:32 - here just so i can
00:34 - get you all i'll try to mention your
00:38 - names
00:39 - i can never do it very well hello devops
00:42 - tech techier i'm from ohio
00:46 - in the united states hello
00:51 - hello quincy thanks for having me on
00:56 - again
00:59 - all right i'm going to increase this
01:02 - just a little bit more there we go
01:08 - all right so we're going to get started
01:09 - in about 30 to 60 seconds
01:12 - again i just want people to
01:16 - filter in a little bit more
01:21 - all right
01:32 - you can't see the workspace
01:36 - well hopefully you can right
01:41 - okay so let's go ahead and get started
01:44 - so
01:45 - the first thing i did a live stream here
01:48 - last week
01:48 - uh exactly one week ago at the same time
01:52 - and for those of you who missed it you
01:54 - don't know who i am i'm gary simon i've
01:56 - been a ui ux designer
01:57 - and a front-end developer for the last
01:59 - 20 years i've been doing the teaching
02:01 - thing for the last 10 years on my own
02:03 - youtube channel
02:04 - which you can check out right here
02:07 - so it's at youtube.com forward slash
02:10 - design course
02:12 - and you can subscribe up i do these live
02:14 - streams here on my channel i call it the
02:16 - negative space
02:17 - i'm going to be doing the same show
02:18 - essentially here and if you like this
02:20 - you know go ahead and subscribe up
02:23 - uh at my channel also designcourse.com
02:26 - that's my site i'm relaunching it in a
02:29 - few months time
02:30 - last week i did mention this site and i
02:33 - told you to enter your email if you want
02:34 - to be notified when that goes live and
02:36 - of course with my luck
02:38 - the server that the api endpoint was on
02:42 - at media temple completely went down so
02:44 - a lot of you tried to enter your email
02:46 - and
02:46 - it gave you an error message so again
02:49 - enter
02:50 - it and this time it will work assuming
02:52 - media temple servers
02:53 - stay up all right and in order to
02:56 - participate
02:57 - you need to go to twitter and you can
02:59 - tweet your
03:00 - user interface design this could be a
03:03 - live website
03:04 - it could be just a figma or adobe xd
03:06 - prototype
03:07 - i and also use the hashtag live ui ux
03:11 - review
03:11 - all this information should be in the
03:13 - description here in youtube
03:15 - all right so i'm not going to be taking
03:16 - these in any particular order i picked
03:18 - out a few initially
03:19 - and so what we're going to be doing is
03:21 - i'm going to be reviewing your ui
03:23 - designs
03:24 - and i'm going to be considering both
03:26 - user interface design and user
03:28 - experience design when i look at these
03:30 - so user interface design would mean i'm
03:32 - taking a look at things like
03:33 - white space alignment scale
03:37 - typography color and contrast in visual
03:39 - hierarchy
03:40 - and when it comes to user experience
03:42 - design or ux design
03:44 - i'm going to be asking myself you know
03:46 - it doesn't make sense to do this or that
03:48 - here
03:49 - uh is it going to be hard for the user
03:51 - to use is the verbiage you're using
03:53 - makes sense
03:54 - and so we'll also ask at the end of my
03:57 - little review
03:59 - i'll ask you who are watching in the
04:02 - chat here to give it a rating of one
04:04 - being the worst and 10 being the best
04:06 - i try not to look because i don't want
04:08 - you guys to poison the well
04:10 - and i'll give my rating afterwards and
04:13 - we'll see if we agree
04:14 - or not all right so the whole goal here
04:16 - is just to improve
04:17 - if i don't review your design don't
04:19 - worry about it that much it's not a big
04:20 - deal you're still going to
04:22 - gain a lot of insight based on what i
04:25 - have to say
04:26 - i what's happening with other people's
04:28 - submissions
04:29 - all right so i've picked out a few like
04:31 - i said initially
04:33 - and i'm just going to get started right
04:36 - here with this particular entry
04:39 - so when i look at this design
04:43 - let me push this over so we don't see
04:44 - the background there we go
04:46 - so when i look at this design
04:49 - what i immediately think is
04:52 - first of all there's not a lot of white
04:54 - space from this little graphic
04:56 - and the the top portion here so we can
04:58 - immediately push this whole section
05:00 - down away from the navigation up top
05:02 - second
05:04 - we're lacking what's called visual
05:06 - hierarchy now
05:07 - again this is a ui design fundamental
05:09 - it's not a ux topic
05:11 - i and i've talked about this before in
05:13 - my last stream
05:14 - but nailing your visual hierarchy is
05:16 - very important because
05:17 - what it means is i'm not sure exactly
05:20 - where i should look
05:21 - first when i consider all this text
05:23 - right here
05:24 - i'm not sure where to look so you need
05:26 - to use
05:27 - your ui design fundamentals such as
05:30 - scale
05:31 - color and contrast and alignment in
05:34 - order to
05:34 - reinforce that visual hierarchy or in
05:37 - other words
05:38 - direct the eye where you want to see it
05:41 - so let me just show you what i mean real
05:43 - quick if i get out the dev tools here
05:45 - and i take this element right here okay
05:47 - well what we could do is we can font
05:49 - weight
05:49 - bold it because i think this is going to
05:51 - be the most
05:53 - one of the most important parts this is
05:55 - kind of like the headline of the website
05:56 - right
05:57 - and i think we could also take color so
05:59 - color and contrast we're going to
06:00 - increase the contrast by making the
06:02 - color white
06:03 - so now all of a sudden we see this the
06:06 - eye is directed to this section
06:08 - much more than this stuff down here so
06:11 - now we have a place to actually look
06:14 - it's probably a little bit longer of a
06:15 - headline than i would want
06:17 - we could also probably slightly increase
06:20 - the font size so what's 2m
06:22 - that's a little bit too big maybe 1.3 m
06:26 - units maybe line height 1.3
06:29 - m as well and now we really can see that
06:33 - this is an important element it's the
06:34 - one thing that we want
06:35 - people to to be able to see all right so
06:39 - next up after this
06:42 - impressed already hit this button and so
06:45 - i'm not going to hit it but it's it's
06:47 - basically a
06:48 - it's a mail to you know their email so
06:51 - it's going to open up my email
06:52 - client um i wouldn't advise doing that
06:56 - now this person is doing something witty
06:59 - which is i see you don't just hit random
07:01 - button on the internet good for you
07:03 - let me flex some of my skills you don't
07:06 - want to trick
07:07 - your visitors i understand you're trying
07:09 - to be unique and witty but you don't
07:10 - really want to trick your visitors
07:12 - because
07:12 - here's the problem sometimes somebody
07:14 - will quickly
07:15 - look at a site they might just read this
07:18 - headline
07:18 - and then see this button like why would
07:20 - i want to hit this button i'm exiting
07:22 - out of this site
07:23 - they're not going to bother reading this
07:24 - part down here where you said
07:26 - you don't just hit a random button so
07:29 - that's something to take into
07:30 - consideration
07:31 - the skills uh progress bar i talk about
07:34 - this a lot in fact i did a video today
07:36 - on my own youtube channel where i talk
07:38 - about
07:38 - the top 10 worst ui design trends of
07:41 - 2020
07:42 - and this is this is actually one of them
07:44 - it's one of the recent ones that i've
07:45 - seen
07:46 - i you don't want to put a progress bar
07:48 - in my opinion
07:50 - on with your skills simply because what
07:52 - if somebody
07:54 - wants somebody who's proficient in c and
07:56 - they see
07:57 - when they stack it up against all your
07:59 - other skill sets
08:01 - it's gonna it only tells them that this
08:03 - person's not very good
08:05 - and here we go again okay okay i agree
08:09 - using progress bro for skills is not a
08:11 - really good idea so you're being witty
08:12 - but you might be confusing people
08:14 - because they may not read this
08:16 - all right so all in all uh that's my
08:18 - review here there's a lot more but i
08:20 - have to move on what do you people think
08:23 - this person should get for a rating one
08:24 - being the worst and 10 being the best by
08:26 - the way if i refresh this you'll see the
08:27 - original design
08:29 - and this is my changes to reinforce the
08:31 - visual hierarchy so if i refresh this
08:33 - you'll see you're not really sure where
08:35 - you should look first so
08:37 - let me know in the youtube chat
08:40 - one being the worst 10 being the best
08:42 - and we'll see if you guys agree with me
08:45 - and i'll give you about 15 seconds until
08:47 - i start seeing some roll
08:52 - in
09:01 - so i'm just kind of scrolling up here
09:04 - trying to think of what i would give
09:05 - this one
09:08 - personally i'm probably
09:11 - going to say around i could see
09:16 - all the comments on the side of my view
09:19 - my peripheral vision i'm not looking at
09:21 - your answers i'm going to go ahead and
09:23 - say
09:24 - a good old
09:29 - 5.3 or so
09:32 - all right so looking at these
09:35 - we have some eight seven five two five
09:38 - seven
09:38 - six six six five five okay yep uh pretty
09:41 - much
09:41 - around there we had some variants there
09:44 - quite a bit so
09:45 - another one that i wanted to review here
09:50 - is from this user right here so
09:54 - there's nothing wrong with absolute
09:56 - simplicity of course we have a lot of
09:58 - simplicity here we have a lot of
10:00 - white space there's just not much
10:02 - happening here
10:03 - one problem is is i we see we have hi
10:07 - i'm you know your name and then
10:08 - underneath it looks like a button
10:10 - i want to click on it but it's not a
10:13 - button so i might rethink that
10:16 - i would also work on and this is a ux
10:18 - specific idea
10:20 - the ad copy here i think you can
10:21 - probably do a little bit more with this
10:22 - area to fill it out
10:24 - um even also taking this left column
10:26 - here in this right column
10:28 - and trying to construct it in such a way
10:30 - that it fills out more of the user
10:32 - interface
10:33 - also there's no call to action this
10:35 - looks like it could be a call to action
10:36 - because it's a button but it's not but
10:37 - so there's not really a call to action
10:39 - if you want people to scroll down
10:40 - at least do the floating animated
10:44 - scroll down area i'm a fan of having
10:47 - buttons though
10:48 - just to give people something to click
10:50 - on to go right where you want them to
10:52 - outside of that we have another section
10:55 - right here
10:55 - now if you look at
10:59 - the code for this this is whole section
11:02 - there's like a
11:02 - i actually like the background here it's
11:05 - a really cool sort of
11:06 - you know very barely visible background
11:08 - it has nice texture to it
11:10 - it this whole section is set up on a
11:11 - height 100 viewport heights or 100 vh
11:14 - in css and that's good that's fine i
11:17 - like that
11:18 - but this section right here has not been
11:21 - centered vertically so we have all this
11:23 - unnecessary white space
11:25 - so you want to address that next up this
11:28 - is unnecessary
11:29 - this whole me thing because you already
11:31 - said about right here you have a title
11:33 - it says a little about me that's all you
11:35 - need
11:35 - so you don't want to be redundant in
11:37 - that sense so i would just delete that
11:39 - and then take this center it vertically
11:42 - so if you're using the grid that would
11:43 - be like place item
11:44 - or place content uh center and that'll
11:47 - automatically do it for you
11:49 - another thing i noticed this is
11:51 - something i see all the time
11:52 - unfortunately is on the this is a
11:55 - desktop
11:56 - view i this would be right here on a
12:00 - mobile device right where it makes sense
12:02 - to use a hamburger menu
12:03 - if you have enough links to justify it
12:05 - but out here
12:08 - you only have three different links
12:11 - the pro this is a ux issue you don't
12:13 - want people to have to unnecessarily
12:15 - click
12:16 - in order to access a navigation you only
12:19 - do that
12:20 - if you don't have enough physical room
12:23 - to give them access to so you only have
12:26 - home
12:26 - or wait me work find me just put those
12:30 - three
12:30 - right here that way people can click on
12:33 - them and access that
12:34 - quite quickly next up this part's not
12:38 - too bad there's no big ui or ux
12:41 - issues occurring here although um i
12:43 - guess
12:44 - if you only have two examples you can go
12:48 - ahead and fill them out but it might
12:49 - make more sense to
12:50 - put these maybe in a column of three and
12:53 - then list out more at the same time
12:56 - all right so that's my review here what
12:59 - do you
12:59 - think that this person should get for a
13:01 - rating one being the worst and ten being
13:03 - the absolute best you've ever seen i'll
13:06 - give you about 15 to 20 seconds
13:30 - all right i'm going to
13:34 - give this a rating of probably
13:39 - let's see there's not a lot of like
13:43 - really bad things happening here
13:46 - so i'm just going to do i like kind of
13:48 - this section here
13:49 - could improve on the contrast um i'm
13:52 - going to say
13:53 - a
13:57 - 6.1 maybe or so
14:01 - yeah there we go very good and by the
14:03 - way everybody
14:06 - please try not to spam don't give your
14:08 - same answer multiple times in the text
14:10 - chat it just clutters it up way too much
14:12 - it makes the life of the moderators
14:14 - difficult um
14:16 - so yeah just only mention your your
14:17 - answer once all right
14:20 - so next up i have another one that i
14:22 - wanted to showcase that somebody
14:24 - submitted
14:26 - all right so what's interesting about
14:28 - this example here
14:30 - is um two days ago i released a video
14:33 - about using photographs
14:35 - for your landing pages specifically like
14:37 - in the hero section of a landing page
14:39 - just like in this context and there's
14:42 - nothing wrong with doing this
14:44 - um i think they used it and they did it
14:47 - correctly because they did
14:48 - push the darkness on this image um well
14:51 - enough
14:52 - so that you can see the type sitting on
14:54 - top of it a lot of times people try to
14:56 - show you the full image without
14:57 - darkening it and then it's hard to read
15:00 - everything on top so they did that well
15:02 - um but if you do want to see
15:04 - alternative more modern ways to approach
15:07 - this type of design this type of layout
15:10 - check my video
15:11 - um because i show a way to do this so
15:13 - that you have a full
15:15 - nice vibrant image that is seamless and
15:17 - kind of worked into the user interface
15:20 - but for what this is welcome to foodika
15:23 - visit blogs i would probably fill this
15:25 - out with a little bit more content
15:27 - and maybe a sub headline at the very
15:29 - least
15:30 - visit blogs i'm not sure you know where
15:34 - this would take me exactly
15:35 - so apparently this is a blog and this is
15:39 - what you want people to end up on
15:41 - right here the most i actually like the
15:43 - design it's pretty solid from what i see
15:46 - here
15:46 - but it does make me wonder if you really
15:49 - want people to go to the blog
15:51 - why do you have kind of like a splash
15:53 - page really
15:54 - i mean i would take him straight to the
15:56 - content as much as possible
15:58 - so coming down here chef's
16:02 - choice weekly special click here
16:05 - okay so i'm trying i'm still kind of
16:08 - confused about what this is
16:09 - exactly like the purpose of the site
16:12 - and so that sometimes that's a ux issue
16:14 - as well sometimes that gets lost and you
16:16 - really want to
16:17 - address this information as much as
16:19 - possible let me close out my
16:21 - my email client um outside of that just
16:24 - looking at the ui design it's
16:26 - itself it's pretty solid here there's
16:28 - some minute things
16:29 - um for instance we have a certain amount
16:30 - of white space between these two columns
16:32 - but then
16:33 - over here it's like half it's really
16:36 - a good idea to use consistent white
16:38 - space especially in the same section
16:40 - between columns and rows
16:42 - so that's a really small gripe also
16:45 - another small gripe i have down here
16:46 - looking at this
16:48 - email form submit there's a nice
16:51 - all-around well-applied white space
16:54 - within this button around the text
16:56 - however if we come over here just
16:57 - slightly i'll increase the size
17:00 - one thing that throws things off these
17:01 - are very new small things but if you if
17:04 - you have a lot of them on a design it's
17:06 - just
17:07 - it's not going to look good and you may
17:08 - not know why but
17:10 - what i would do in this case there's not
17:12 - enough white space
17:13 - on the left right here compared to the
17:17 - top
17:17 - and the bottom as well as what's applied
17:19 - over here so that's very small my new
17:21 - issue that is worth
17:22 - and it's easy to address so if we see
17:25 - padding
17:26 - the element is right here maybe we can
17:29 - put one m
17:30 - unit
17:32 - 1m on the left
17:37 - so now that small change just
17:40 - brings everything together so if i
17:42 - refresh this you'll see what it goes
17:43 - back to it's just slightly off
17:46 - all right so that is my review for this
17:48 - one
17:49 - what do you people think that this
17:51 - person should get for a rating one being
17:53 - the worst you've ever seen and 10 being
17:56 - the best
17:56 - you have 15 to 20 seconds
18:10 - so let's see me what would i give this
18:13 - i mean this is a nice photograph it is
18:15 - up here
18:18 - i'm not too happy about
18:21 - uh position fixed backgrounds here
18:28 - i think it's a little bit disorienting
18:29 - to people so i probably wouldn't do that
18:32 - but this is pretty solid overall
18:34 - probably going to be our highest rated
18:36 - one so far to the point so i'm going to
18:38 - give this one
18:40 - a let's see a
18:46 - seven just a straight up seven i think
18:48 - would work pretty well
18:50 - for that example all right
18:53 - so i have a couple more that i just
18:56 - chose before we began and then i'll
18:57 - start looking at the
18:59 - twitter feed for the hashtag
19:04 - all right so there's a number of issues
19:07 - with this particular example and
19:11 - in this case i would say the person who
19:13 - designed this
19:14 - really needs to understand
19:18 - those ui design fundamentals that i
19:20 - mentioned before
19:21 - because a lot of this is ui design based
19:24 - not necessarily ux based
19:26 - so like a like i mentioned at the
19:28 - beginning of the stream white space
19:30 - alignment scale typography color and
19:32 - contrast and visual hierarchy
19:34 - you need to understand all of those and
19:36 - then gain practice applying them
19:39 - so first and foremost we have a
19:42 - navigation up here
19:43 - but then we have this small amount of
19:46 - text
19:46 - kind of really close so there's an issue
19:49 - of a lack of white space first and
19:50 - foremost
19:52 - and there's also i it doesn't really
19:55 - make sense
19:56 - also from a ux standpoint to have this
19:58 - type right here when you have
20:01 - a headline and then a sub headline over
20:03 - here so it feels very disconnected and
20:05 - this just seems randomly placed
20:07 - so what i would do is i would take this
20:09 - whole section and
20:11 - i would oh and by the way just a front
20:13 - end development tip here you don't want
20:14 - to have like two h1s here
20:16 - for this these would probably be the
20:18 - best
20:20 - used as like paragraph tags right here
20:22 - so i would remove those
20:24 - so now we simplify the top that looks
20:27 - better
20:27 - and it makes more sense also you want to
20:30 - make sure
20:31 - as much as you can
20:36 - you want to make sure that your design
20:39 - is working well
20:40 - responsively and notice this button
20:43 - it's touching the edge here and it just
20:45 - doesn't look very good
20:47 - in this case so you want to fix that as
20:49 - much as possible
20:50 - next up there's an issue with visual
20:53 - hierarchy in the topography
20:55 - so yes this is bigger and this is
20:57 - slightly smaller
20:59 - but it's still not separated enough
21:01 - visually so i would
21:03 - reduce the scale here and maybe even
21:05 - make the font weight normal
21:07 - and not bold and then that you see that
21:09 - clear separation between those two
21:10 - elements
21:11 - and the view my work is unnecessarily
21:13 - large you're going to want to take that
21:15 - down quite a bit
21:17 - also i would say this area this little
21:20 - blob
21:21 - sort of bezier curve it doesn't look 100
21:25 - smooth to me it looks like somebody took
21:27 - this into maybe an illustrator a vector
21:29 - drawing application
21:30 - and where you place and how you place
21:33 - the anchor points is very important when
21:35 - it comes to creating these
21:36 - very smooth blob effects so i would just
21:40 - i try to remedy that as well your
21:42 - navigation too much white space in
21:44 - between each individual link
21:46 - you'd want to fix that and yeah so
21:49 - that's just
21:49 - uh my quick review of this landing page
21:52 - what do you
21:52 - people think this person should get for
21:54 - a rating one being the worst in 10 being
21:56 - the best
22:06 - i don't agree that it's a seven i want
22:09 - you i want to judge
22:11 - how it currently is
22:17 - for me
22:21 - i think it will give this one a rating
22:24 - of
22:29 - yeah it's going to have to be a little
22:30 - bit on the lower side just because
22:31 - there's a lot of issues
22:33 - so i'm going to give this one a flat
22:36 - 4. yes i think that's fair enough now if
22:40 - you fixed all those issues that i
22:41 - mentioned yeah you can bump this up to
22:43 - like a 7 or so
22:44 - or 7.5 based on the content that is here
22:47 - and how it's presented
22:49 - all right seems like most of you agree
22:54 - all right next up there's one more that
22:57 - i had that was
22:58 - pre-planned here
23:01 - all right so a couple issues right away
23:04 - that i'm noticing
23:06 - are this graphic right here
23:10 - look how close it is to the navigation
23:13 - you know you
23:13 - definitely want to give that white space
23:15 - there's nothing worse than something
23:17 - that's just like sitting there
23:18 - in the navigation or right next to it
23:20 - that's just taking focus
23:22 - away so margin top you know
23:25 - maybe seven m units there we go
23:28 - that's a lot better looks a thousand
23:30 - times better
23:31 - next up we have the headline in the sub
23:34 - headline
23:35 - those are in terms of typogra
23:38 - strictly speaking of typography those
23:40 - are done well
23:42 - this is light this is bold and
23:45 - it's also larger so it's done well but i
23:48 - would say there's
23:48 - probably a little bit too much white
23:49 - space between both of these
23:52 - and then next up here's here's a ux
23:55 - issue
23:56 - i this doesn't make sense in my opinion
23:59 - it doesn't make sense to use this little
24:00 - linkedin embed right here
24:02 - for a few reasons first of all it
24:05 - doesn't really quite fit this design
24:07 - i i understand that you you want them to
24:10 - go to your linkedin
24:12 - but at the same time you already have a
24:14 - linkedin
24:15 - right here along with all of your other
24:17 - elements and so
24:18 - if you really want them to go to your
24:20 - linkedin i would
24:22 - simply put a button like this and that's
24:25 - it i want to put this whole thing right
24:26 - here
24:27 - and that way it would really help the
24:29 - flow of your design a lot better because
24:30 - this just does
24:31 - it seems out of place right here um
24:34 - next up all right so i actually like
24:37 - this section here
24:39 - um where we have the two columns right
24:42 - here and i strive for i
24:44 - i like that that's really set up well
24:46 - but
24:47 - i would say there's an issue with color
24:49 - there's also
24:50 - an issue with um you making this
24:54 - the description bold and making that
24:56 - kind of stand out more
24:58 - rather than the title of each or the
25:00 - label of each of these four sections so
25:02 - let me show you real quickly how i would
25:03 - refactor
25:04 - this particular design so first of all
25:07 - it's kind of also hard on the eyes a
25:09 - little bit too hard on the eye so i
25:10 - would change this color
25:12 - to maybe something that's a
25:16 - darker desaturated bluish or so
25:19 - i like that um and then inside of it
25:23 - we'll take these elements
25:26 - and we'll do color white
25:29 - and we're also going to font weight bold
25:31 - those now i know it looks ugly right now
25:33 - but don't worry we're going to fix
25:35 - all of that and then you might want to
25:38 - say
25:38 - okay maybe we'll make the color white
25:40 - here and that's fine
25:42 - but you know what we could still
25:44 - increase
25:45 - the or improve the visual hierarchy of
25:47 - this section
25:48 - because these being 100 white and these
25:50 - being 100 white
25:51 - kind of makes a little bit hard to
25:54 - quickly scan this area so what i would
25:57 - do is instead of making it white
25:59 - here's my little trick we take the color
26:01 - picker and you could do this in figma or
26:03 - adobe xd
26:04 - if you're working in a prototyping
26:05 - software or design we take the
26:07 - background that's sitting on
26:09 - now of course it's hidden now i like to
26:11 - take the color picker and just go
26:13 - up a little bit and notice where it says
26:16 - i'm not sure if you can see it here
26:17 - color con color it says contrast ratio
26:21 - 3.14 you want to get that up into where
26:24 - it this gives you a positive reading a
26:27 - check mark so right there
26:30 - is probably the minimum double a and
26:33 - this is according to
26:34 - the wcag 2.0 color contrast guidelines i
26:38 - know that's kind of like a word solid
26:39 - there
26:40 - look it up i've done videos on this you
26:42 - want to make sure you have a minimum
26:44 - level
26:44 - of contrast and that way you'll have a
26:47 - much more accessible design for those
26:49 - who have visual impairments
26:52 - so like right around there would be
26:53 - pretty good i like that so
26:55 - look at this i i like this a lot better
26:58 - compared to what it was before i'm going
27:00 - to refresh and show you the original so
27:02 - this is what i had
27:03 - and now look at the original so this is
27:05 - just kind of harder to read in my
27:07 - opinion
27:08 - if you wanted to keep the same
27:09 - background color you can but at least
27:11 - bold these up and make these
27:13 - uh not quite as bold as they are or just
27:16 - make this a lot bolder
27:18 - all right so that's my quick review here
27:21 - for this design
27:22 - what does everyone think this person
27:24 - should get for a rating one being the
27:26 - worst in 10 being
27:27 - the absolute best
27:41 - i'm going to make an adjustment to
27:43 - myself real quick while you get your
27:45 - answers in
27:55 - there i wanted to improve myself
27:58 - the color was off with me all right so
28:01 - for this one
28:02 - i'm going to go ahead and give this a
28:03 - rating of
28:08 - yeah i think this is a solid
28:13 - 6.3 so yes i am using the point systems
28:17 - i'm getting a little bit more specific
28:19 - 10 just isn't enough or just using the
28:21 - ones place all right so it seems like
28:24 - a negative 10. that's not nice all right
28:26 - [Music]
28:28 - okay so yeah it seems like
28:32 - yep you're welcome let's go ahead
28:38 - and look at some of the ones that have
28:42 - been submitted here
28:43 - so let me refresh this and
28:48 - we'll check out just a few of these um
28:51 - and
28:52 - see what how i can do this off the cuff
28:54 - which i i do this
28:56 - for the most part um this is i'm going
28:58 - to try to find
28:59 - sites or examples that are live on in
29:02 - the browser because i like to also
29:03 - just see it fully realized as opposed to
29:05 - a prototype most of the time
29:07 - um okay gary please review this one
29:10 - uh so this is an aesthetic
29:14 - like a makeup company all right
29:18 - all right okay so
29:23 - first thing the first thing that in
29:26 - a good thing is if i have to sit and
29:28 - stare out of design for a while
29:30 - in order to find something really wrong
29:32 - that's a good thing
29:34 - but there is something that i think
29:36 - could definitely be approved here
29:38 - and that is the orientation the layout
29:40 - of this form
29:42 - also there could be accessibility issues
29:44 - because if this is just an email
29:47 - placeholder for the label it gets hidden
29:50 - i mentioned this in the last stream i
29:52 - have to mention it every time i do one
29:53 - of these live streams because
29:54 - too many people rely on the placeholder
29:56 - value as a label
29:58 - but the problem is once you start typing
30:00 - in it the label goes away
30:02 - and then sometimes people they might get
30:04 - up from their computer and come back
30:05 - they forget
30:07 - what is this form field i have no clue
30:09 - what i'm doing here
30:10 - so it's always nice to have at least a
30:12 - floating label
30:13 - i in you can't go wrong when you're
30:16 - actually using
30:17 - a label element in html
30:20 - because it will never be hidden all
30:23 - right
30:24 - all right next up when you have just
30:26 - three elements
30:27 - form elements like this having them
30:29 - float next to each other like one here
30:31 - one here
30:32 - and then your name right here and then
30:34 - request it makes more sense to collapse
30:37 - those all each on their own row
30:39 - so that way it's a lot more easy for
30:42 - people to fill out
30:44 - and just scan with their eyes so i
30:45 - wouldn't agree with having these in two
30:48 - different columns outside of that
30:52 - let me scroll down see what else is
30:53 - happening here
30:56 - all right i think you could probably
30:59 - increase the size
31:01 - or at least the positioning so you have
31:04 - this card here
31:05 - you want to take this and make sure that
31:07 - this centered vertically within that
31:09 - card
31:10 - same thing here i would probably
31:14 - increase the visual hierarchy here or
31:16 - improve it by taking
31:18 - these elements on the left and making
31:19 - them bold
31:21 - and that way you can easily separate
31:22 - them from the prices over here
31:26 - and there is a lot of kind of card based
31:28 - design there's a lot of type here
31:31 - so i might think about possibly
31:35 - restructuring that
31:36 - to make it a little bit less i don't
31:39 - know maybe i'm wrong about that
31:40 - um i just i think it probably be
31:43 - improved visually
31:45 - if you bold these up over here and you
31:47 - center things over here
31:52 - the type is a little bit small in areas
31:54 - like right here chin
31:57 - cheek and nose i thought that said check
31:59 - for a second
32:00 - a little bit small on the small side so
32:02 - you definitely
32:03 - want to rethink that possibly maybe
32:05 - increase it
32:07 - um i really like the type you're
32:10 - definitely
32:11 - reinforcing that that higher end
32:14 - feel uh this this feels luxurious to me
32:17 - and that's
32:17 - kind of what serif fonts tend to do but
32:20 - so i think that's done well
32:22 - there's good white space here inside of
32:24 - these containers so that's all working
32:25 - out well
32:27 - you might want to separate
32:32 - this section right here
32:35 - with the about section in a different
32:37 - content container perhaps
32:39 - maybe making this part like a lighter
32:41 - color maybe even white or close to it
32:45 - and that way it kind of gives more
32:47 - structure to the layout having them
32:49 - inside of individual containers
32:53 - all right and then same comment with the
32:55 - uh this this area right here
32:57 - um make sure you're using labels or at
33:01 - least floating labels
33:02 - all right what do you think this person
33:04 - should get for a rating one being
33:06 - the worst and 10 being the best
33:09 - also i'd probably try to increase the
33:12 - quality of your photo here you can tell
33:13 - there's
33:14 - some decent pixelation here so
33:17 - definitely look into that
33:31 - i'm going to give this one a
33:37 - let's think here
33:43 - i'm going to give it a
33:46 - 6.9
33:50 - and it seems like most of you are
33:51 - agreeing with that
33:53 - already all right who is next
33:56 - up let's see here
33:59 - let me scroll down just because i don't
34:00 - want to people i want to make it random
34:03 - like i don't want to do only the latest
34:04 - submitted so i'm just going to scroll
34:06 - down randomly and then
34:07 - just check some of these out um
34:11 - let's see here i've been doing a lot of
34:15 - portfolios so i kind of want to
34:18 - change that up first project somebody's
34:21 - first project i'm going to move it off
34:23 - screen first
34:24 - and then check it out okay
34:27 - now this is your first project i'm
34:30 - hoping
34:32 - that it's not based on a template
34:33 - because if i'm
34:35 - if i'm reviewing designs i don't want to
34:38 - base it on a template um that somebody
34:41 - created already so i'm just going to
34:42 - make the assumption that this
34:43 - is not a template the reason i say that
34:46 - because if it's your first design this
34:47 - is actually
34:48 - pretty good for somebody's first design
34:51 - so
34:52 - looking at this there's some um let's
34:54 - see here strange
34:55 - things happening just because we have no
34:58 - navigation that's the only reason i say
35:00 - that now
35:00 - you don't always need a navigation if
35:03 - you have an extremely
35:04 - simple one-page site you know maybe you
35:07 - have one purpose and that's it
35:09 - so maybe that's the case here again once
35:12 - again we
35:13 - have this issue with the forms i'm going
35:16 - to assume these aren't floating you can
35:17 - never know until you click inside of it
35:19 - to see if they
35:20 - somehow float up so if i do full name
35:24 - yeah unfortunately they're hidden also i
35:27 - wouldn't make the actual type
35:28 - white because white on this light gray
35:30 - is not enough contrast i guarantee that
35:32 - would that would fail the contrast
35:33 - checker
35:34 - so you want to use labels here um
35:37 - also this doesn't make sense to me right
35:39 - here having the contact button
35:43 - right outside of the container right
35:44 - here that i would not do that
35:47 - also i would not use this gray color
35:50 - right here this it's kind of like a mid
35:52 - mid gray eye for using as like uh colors
35:55 - like for like backgrounds and stuff like
35:57 - the background of this little card here
35:59 - almost never works it's very hard to
36:01 - make it look good so i would change that
36:03 - color to something else
36:05 - so for instance i would take
36:09 - get out of there i i dealt with this
36:11 - last time okay there he goes
36:12 - so i would take this
36:15 - background and i would make it something
36:17 - that fits you know you're using this
36:19 - color right here
36:20 - we could use that that looks better
36:22 - already just that change you could go
36:24 - darker
36:25 - maybe it will create a little bit more
36:27 - saturation
36:32 - or you know i probably say this one is
36:35 - if you're gonna do this that would be
36:36 - best and then also i would change uh let
36:40 - me change that again really quickly
36:42 - um also i would change
36:45 - the gray here uh that doesn't that what
36:48 - that
36:49 - because it's great now it doesn't really
36:50 - look that good
36:52 - so i don't see the background
36:55 - property for this
36:59 - let's see if i can still change it so if
37:00 - i change background
37:04 - no don't do that i was just typing blue
37:06 - so i have access to the color picker
37:08 - i would take this and
37:11 - maybe make it darker probably make it a
37:14 - little bit darker like that
37:16 - and then fix up the color here as well
37:18 - because the gray doesn't fit very well
37:20 - so if i refresh we'll see the original
37:22 - and i'm just not a big fan of that one
37:24 - right there outside of that
37:26 - looking at this this is pretty good
37:28 - right here you can read it
37:29 - we have a lot of borders borders are one
37:31 - of those things that are
37:32 - for the most part outdated but
37:36 - it's not horrible here um so i'm just
37:39 - clicking on this
37:42 - all right so there's not much else i can
37:44 - do i can't scroll down
37:45 - so i will conclude this rating a one
37:48 - being the worst time being the best
37:50 - what do you think this person should
37:51 - receive
37:55 - yeah you're right you know we could
37:56 - actually because this is the call to
37:58 - action right here we could make this
37:59 - stand out look a lot more we could take
38:01 - the
38:02 - the blue this color this button put it
38:05 - inside here
38:05 - and then make it like orange or we can
38:08 - make this whole section really stick out
38:10 - and make it orange as well because
38:12 - orange is a good complementary color
38:14 - uh to to blue i mean yeah to like a blue
38:17 - color here so
38:19 - um
38:24 - now of course the gray inside of it
38:26 - really makes it look ugly
38:29 - but that could definitely work so for
38:32 - this i'm going to give this a rating
38:34 - for what it is and also especially
38:36 - considering if this is really something
38:37 - they did from scratch it's their first
38:39 - design
38:40 - it's it's pretty impressive but as it is
38:42 - not considering that
38:44 - as it stands i'm probably going to give
38:46 - this a
38:50 - just a flat
38:54 - sometimes i i get stalled like 5.9 or so
38:59 - but considering it's their first design
39:02 - if they designed it i i have to give it
39:04 - like an eight or nine
39:05 - uh for a first time for sure you should
39:07 - see some of my stuff
39:08 - back in the late 90s when i started not
39:12 - good all right
39:15 - so next up i let's see here
39:19 - let's come up here down i'm trying to
39:22 - stay away from portfolios just because
39:24 - there's so many portfolios i've done
39:26 - already
39:32 - let's see so there's so many portfolios
39:37 - this one might not be a portfolio so let
39:39 - me check
39:42 - all right so we'll really quickly
39:45 - spend some time on this one this one
39:48 - needs a lot of work
39:50 - um first of all you don't want to have
39:53 - your image here
39:54 - not being fluid you don't want this to
39:56 - happen next up we have an issue with
39:58 - contrast you can't hardly read this
40:00 - remember i talked about using
40:01 - backgrounds
40:02 - photographs as backgrounds you want to
40:03 - push them off so they're water marks
40:05 - so you decrease the brightness
40:08 - and you darken the whole thing and then
40:10 - that way we can see what's up you don't
40:11 - want to make
40:12 - um this sort of thing comic sans uh and
40:16 - mix your typefaces so that's bad
40:17 - topography right there
40:18 - you don't want to have glows on them as
40:20 - well on your text it pretty much will
40:22 - never turn out looking well
40:24 - um we also have an issue here um with
40:27 - just the cards being spaced out like
40:29 - this
40:30 - and kind of disconnected with the type
40:32 - underneath it not being encased in them
40:34 - so yeah we're not going to bother with a
40:36 - rating for this one just because there's
40:37 - really not
40:38 - enough there but i in that kind of case
40:41 - definitely go back to the basics in
40:42 - terms of ui design and learn about all
40:44 - those fundamentals that i mentioned
40:45 - before
40:46 - next up i this is a project that is
40:50 - designed to develop for a startup
40:51 - company
40:52 - so let's check that out always moving it
40:56 - off to the side of the screen
40:58 - just to be safe okay
41:01 - now looking at this okay so
41:07 - we have the logos already here
41:11 - and i will say now i've been i was an
41:13 - identity designer a logo designer
41:16 - uh and that's all i did for about five
41:18 - to six years
41:20 - of my career and i've i've designed
41:24 - countless logos and i can say right now
41:26 - that this logo needs to be
41:28 - rethought because this looks like it
41:31 - says peeve
41:32 - not speed this s is too abstract so i
41:36 - i'm not sure if you have control over
41:37 - this or if this is your
41:39 - your project but i would definitely
41:40 - change that because that's an issue
41:42 - people are going to think your business
41:43 - name is peeve so
41:45 - outside of that in terms of uh ux and
41:49 - your
41:50 - your ad copy uh that you're using or
41:52 - your your web copy
41:54 - speed does not make sense here um
41:57 - i would this is
42:01 - first of all in terms of the visual
42:03 - hierarchy you're placing all the
42:04 - emphasis on the name
42:06 - and i don't think that makes sense to me
42:09 - the emphasis should be on the headline
42:10 - and identifying what exactly is
42:13 - happening here what is this business
42:15 - about what is this website about
42:17 - welcome to the world of faster
42:18 - deliveries that's what we want to know
42:20 - we don't want to have this huge emphasis
42:23 - this big
42:24 - white container with the business name
42:27 - so i would change that the discover more
42:30 - when you hover over it i would get rid
42:31 - of that
42:32 - uh the drop shadow it just it doesn't
42:35 - work well in my opinion it just
42:37 - adds unnecessary uh clutter or if you're
42:39 - going to do it
42:40 - make it be more of an afterthought don't
42:42 - make it be so obvious
42:44 - as it is um coming down oh also
42:47 - the navigation i wouldn't have an
42:49 - underline under
42:50 - every single nav item maybe
42:54 - the one that you're currently on like
42:56 - this is the home page or the about page
42:58 - i'm not sure which
42:58 - it's obviously the home page or whatever
43:01 - um but not every single one of them just
43:03 - because the big thick borders
43:04 - add unnecessary clutter also
43:09 - there's been a lot of there's been
43:10 - several studies about
43:13 - people expecting the a home link
43:16 - uh in your navigation people expect to
43:18 - see a home button so they can get back
43:20 - to
43:20 - the home page or what they perceive as
43:21 - being the home page so that's also
43:23 - something just to think about
43:25 - people want to see a home button
43:28 - scrolling down here
43:29 - all right so now i scroll down we're
43:32 - left with just this for quite a while
43:35 - which is a big empty area so i would
43:37 - make this
43:38 - come in quicker also this is too large
43:43 - on this resolution at least i'm not sure
43:45 - how responsive it is and it's not
43:46 - responsive so the layout breaks i'm not
43:48 - sure if
43:49 - maybe you didn't get to that part yet
43:51 - because this looks like it's
43:52 - designed only for desktop so you
43:54 - definitely want to fix that if that's
43:56 - something that you haven't considered
43:59 - we have issues with the topography and
44:01 - the visual hierarchy
44:03 - what we do is more which is the label
44:05 - that needs to be
44:06 - the thing that catches people's eye
44:07 - their eye the most
44:09 - i this yeah this is
44:12 - way too large you don't want it
44:14 - overlapping need more white space also
44:16 - has alignment issues so there's a lot
44:18 - happening here
44:19 - that could definitely be fixed
44:22 - this is probably the best part i kind of
44:24 - like this although i would have more
44:26 - white space
44:27 - away from the center line here
44:32 - all right so that is my rating one being
44:35 - the worst 10 being the best
44:36 - what do you people think this person
44:38 - deserves i'll give you about 15 to 20
44:40 - seconds
44:49 - i will be doing this for about 15 more
44:52 - minutes or so
44:53 - and then we will conclude
45:03 - what do i want to give this design
45:07 - i'm personally thinking somewhere in the
45:09 - fives
45:10 - the type is just way too large i mean
45:13 - this could be cut down way down way way
45:15 - way way down
45:17 - along with these icons here as well by
45:19 - like
45:20 - hundreds of percent down i'm going to
45:22 - give this one
45:23 - just a flat
45:27 - 5.0 maybe 4.6
45:33 - or 4.9 or so seems like
45:38 - most of you are disagreeing with me you
45:40 - think it should be rated higher
45:43 - okay well that's okay
45:47 - not everybody can be 100 right like me
45:50 - i kid all right uh let's go up back top
45:54 - here
45:55 - and i'll check out some of these that
45:56 - were submitted um
45:59 - let's see here we'll do latest
46:02 - okay so here is a esport site
46:05 - i did all right um it's in a different
46:08 - language
46:10 - so i'm going to use the google translate
46:12 - option
46:16 - or at least i'm going to try to
46:22 - all right we have some we have quite a
46:25 - bit of animation occurring here
46:28 - all right so let's refresh this
46:35 - now it's an esports site so we have to
46:37 - take that
46:38 - into consideration um when i'm doing
46:41 - this review because
46:44 - you know the logo being intense the
46:46 - animation intents in the background
46:48 - video being intense you know that's more
46:50 - forgivable and acceptable um or maybe
46:53 - even warranted
46:54 - um given the nature of the site and what
46:57 - it's about
46:58 - having said that i would say there's
47:00 - probably a little bit
47:01 - too much animation occurring in the
47:04 - background so it's a little bit
47:06 - disorienting
47:07 - looking at this so you could still keep
47:10 - the video based background
47:12 - but i would probably try to choose clips
47:14 - that are
47:16 - a little bit less in motion all right so
47:19 - reduced motion
47:21 - also i do think though that they've done
47:24 - a very good job
47:25 - of making it more of a watermark and
47:28 - decreasing
47:29 - the contrast and making it a desaturated
47:32 - 100 percent
47:33 - grayscale so that works quite well
47:37 - the logo placement i would like to see
47:38 - it up a little bit higher
47:40 - because it's kind of further down on the
47:41 - page and also
47:44 - you're missing something that's really
47:46 - important in my opinion yeah we know
47:48 - this is about esports because it says it
47:50 - here in your logo
47:52 - however what else is about we need to be
47:54 - a little bit more specific and use
47:56 - all this space wisely um because
47:59 - every page should have a goal and so i
48:01 - don't know what i'm supposed to do here
48:03 - i don't know what type this is
48:05 - like is this a is this news is this a
48:07 - news site
48:08 - is this um is this like a
48:12 - of a person or a company that has esport
48:16 - events like i'm not really sure what's
48:17 - happening here just
48:18 - yet
48:22 - or is this a team like is this an
48:24 - esports like clan
48:26 - i used to be i used to play quake 2 like
48:28 - crazy
48:29 - and i was in clans back then this is
48:31 - back in late 90s and early 2000s
48:34 - so i think we need to address what
48:37 - exactly
48:38 - this site is about a little bit more in
48:40 - this area
48:41 - but overall there's some cool things
48:43 - happening here issue with alignment
48:46 - if we we can see right here it says sun
48:48 - we have the title
48:49 - subtitle but then pushed over about 20
48:53 - pixels is the description
48:55 - you want those to be on the same exact
48:57 - column also
48:59 - um i would work with the
49:03 - i'll probably put this in all into a
49:05 - paragraph and i would not
49:07 - separate them with lines right here
49:09 - because it just looks
49:10 - a little bit too disconnected and a
49:12 - little bit
49:13 - too dis uh a little bit too unorganized
49:18 - all right so what do you think this
49:20 - should be click on matches somebody
49:22 - wants me to click on matches
49:28 - all right one issue here
49:31 - the match with this little logo hard to
49:34 - see
49:34 - um nonetheless i'm not going to review
49:36 - the whole site though we don't have
49:37 - enough time for that
49:38 - one being the worst 10 being the best
49:40 - let me know in the comments what you
49:42 - think
49:52 - esports automatically zero
50:01 - oh wait
50:05 - it looks like oh i thought this was
50:07 - fixed it was based on like scroll
50:08 - position
50:09 - i'm going to give this right here
50:13 - i'm going to give this a rating of
50:22 - a 6.3
50:27 - or so
50:31 - some people i tell you
50:34 - just because you spam it 20 times 10
50:37 - doesn't make it 10. i'm sorry
50:40 - all right okay let's continue on
50:52 - my first commercially used website oh
50:55 - okay i love this i love these types here
50:58 - all right i'm going to this is another
51:01 - one i have to
51:02 - translate
51:07 - if you hear a strange noise in the
51:08 - background that is the garage door
51:10 - opening up right now underneath me
51:13 - it'll be done in a second all right
51:16 - so hair stylist all right so
51:20 - another video background this one this
51:23 - background seems to be pretty decent
51:25 - because it is darker
51:26 - and you can clearly see the elements on
51:28 - top of it
51:30 - um i still need something more to be
51:33 - desired in this area
51:35 - where it just says hair stylist and then
51:38 - the name of the hair stylist
51:40 - i might want to do something a little
51:41 - bit more unique
51:43 - or include these but have these be like
51:45 - sub elements
51:47 - or subtitles and then use
51:50 - something like this size for an actual
51:53 - headline that says something very
51:54 - interesting
51:55 - and pertinent or relevant about your
51:57 - business i'm coming down here
52:00 - this section right here seems like
52:04 - um it could definitely use
52:09 - improvement on the topography side of
52:12 - things so like this
52:14 - wow we're using font
52:17 - properties here font size
52:24 - 2m units margin bottom
52:28 - okay that's not working sometimes these
52:30 - aren't working well
52:32 - depending on which element i'm choosing
52:33 - who are using brs i wouldn't use
52:36 - the break elements as well but i would
52:39 - push this down
52:40 - as well and maybe even restructure this
52:45 - um what i would do this stuff right here
52:47 - i probably push
52:48 - i would take this whole car this whole
52:50 - section and put it down
52:52 - beneath the about me section or even
52:55 - down
52:55 - further and also a nice thing to do
52:58 - is i all this location information
53:02 - is to maybe embed like a google maps
53:04 - area maybe in the right column and then
53:06 - have this
53:07 - situated to the left column outside of
53:10 - that
53:13 - more white space above this section
53:15 - because these are two different sections
53:16 - you have about me and what i offer so i
53:18 - put more white space or margin top
53:20 - on this element to separate it out more
53:23 - um coming down all right so it's fine
53:27 - you use placeholders as long as you do
53:29 - have labels and this person does have
53:31 - labels so that's good
53:32 - um sometimes though i think you don't
53:36 - need to have the placeholder value if
53:37 - you're dealing with
53:39 - obvious form elements such as the email
53:42 - and the subject it just seems repetitive
53:44 - in my opinion and it does clutter it up
53:46 - unnecessarily
53:47 - send button i would probably get rid of
53:50 - the the white outline
53:52 - all right one being the worst 10 being
53:55 - the best what do you all believe
53:57 - this person should receive as a rating
54:13 - a abd you saw jean or whatever your name
54:16 - is
54:17 - please stop doing that don't spam
54:31 - i'm going to give this one here and this
54:33 - is hey this is a great job for your
54:35 - first
54:35 - commercially accepted you know live
54:38 - website
54:39 - so you're definitely on the right track
54:42 - i'm going to give this one
54:45 - a
54:49 - 6.5 or so
54:54 - all right next up
55:00 - we'll probably do one more or so
55:02 - depending on the time that we have
55:04 - left we have about six minutes
55:07 - all right i'm coming down
55:12 - this is a well i don't want to deal with
55:14 - figma links honestly just because we
55:15 - have so many
55:16 - that we can choose not a portfolio
55:21 - all right okay it is not a portfolio
55:23 - very good okay
55:26 - so speaking of trends
55:29 - um these trends i i forget
55:32 - what was it um i forget the website name
55:37 - where you can find many of these type of
55:38 - design illustrations which are fine to
55:41 - use but i think
55:42 - because so many people use them they're
55:44 - overused now
55:46 - and you can never go wrong uh trying to
55:48 - use something that's more unique
55:50 - um but still this works well for what it
55:53 - is
55:54 - looking at the rest of this i see a lot
55:56 - of blue and not much variation in the
55:59 - type
55:59 - um in terms of the color at least i
56:02 - think we could possibly
56:04 - improve that a little bit by changing
56:07 - this
56:08 - maybe possibly making this darker or
56:10 - making this text darker
56:12 - outside of that though the it is i like
56:15 - how it's set up
56:16 - this is set up pretty well um
56:20 - in terms of the size and the visual
56:21 - hierarchy
56:23 - um again like i said everything's just
56:25 - blue i think
56:26 - a little bit of variation would help in
56:28 - one way or the other
56:30 - now here's a good thing two different
56:33 - sections right here
56:34 - separated by this background a good
56:36 - amount of equal
56:37 - consistent white space between the top
56:39 - of this element
56:41 - in this section right here and the
56:42 - bottom of these elements
56:44 - and where this section ends right here
56:46 - so that's that's one of those small
56:47 - things that really helps out a design
56:51 - i like this nice blue a lot smaller
56:55 - sub labels or subtitle i should say
56:58 - versus the title
56:59 - and this right here is a little
57:01 - description all three of these elements
57:03 - are designed
57:04 - differently in terms of topography and
57:06 - that really helps it
57:08 - out a lot
57:12 - now this part seems kind of disconnected
57:15 - to me
57:16 - um i don't know why okay everything up
57:18 - to this point has been
57:20 - within this container with a column
57:22 - starting here
57:23 - and then a column ending here
57:26 - but then this is it breaks out of the
57:28 - columns structure and i don't like that
57:31 - so this shouldn't be based on fluid this
57:33 - should these should all be moved
57:35 - together
57:36 - uh inside of the same container you
57:38 - would still have white space between
57:39 - them
57:40 - but not as much
57:43 - buy now button should stick out more
57:45 - make that white
57:46 - not this background color that way it
57:48 - will really stick out as an option to
57:50 - click
57:53 - and then down here i would probably just
57:54 - make this bold maybe darker
57:59 - all right what do you think this person
58:02 - should get for a rating one being the
58:03 - worst and 10 being the best
58:08 - quincy yes uh you're right i it's just i
58:11 - i've seen them
58:12 - these these images so much i
58:15 - but yeah on draw.ceo is exactly what i
58:17 - was thinking
58:18 - there are so many of those illustrations
58:23 - it's it's insane i'm not even sure if
58:27 - like are they perhaps using some sort of
58:30 - like
58:30 - ai generated or something because
58:32 - there's so many of them it's it's insane
58:35 - i i like them it's just one of those
58:37 - things that i see everybody using
58:38 - and you're right a victim of our own
58:40 - success for this one i'm going to go
58:43 - ahead and give
58:44 - i really like this section here this is
58:45 - like the best design section simple but
58:47 - it works well
58:48 - i'm going to go ahead and give this one
58:49 - a
58:56 - 7.1 yeah
59:04 - oh this time quincy gave a less a lesser
59:07 - rating
59:08 - all right we're gonna do one more and
59:10 - then we'll go ahead and wrap this
59:12 - up so i'm gonna come back up and refresh
59:18 - all right um who do i want to
59:22 - try now um
59:26 - a music website this this person said
59:29 - it's their first
59:30 - music website and so
59:33 - because i consider myself a hobby
59:35 - musician we're gonna check that out
59:38 - really sad news yesterday one of the
59:40 - greatest guitar players eddie van halen
59:42 - died
59:44 - unfortunately if you go to my twitter
59:47 - you can see me
59:48 - playing attempting to play the eruption
59:51 - solo
59:51 - from van halen so definitely check that
59:53 - out shameless plug
59:56 - all right um okay we so we have
59:59 - alignment issues here right away
60:01 - the logo which i like it's very simple
60:05 - starts here but then everything breaks
60:07 - out outside of it and we have another
60:09 - columns
60:10 - right here this right here should all
60:12 - start on this line this column this
60:14 - invisible column
60:16 - that's set the tone is set right there
60:18 - by this right here so
60:20 - move that into the left and then also
60:22 - take these headphones which i like this
60:25 - this background move that over to the
60:27 - right as well
60:28 - you'll have to because this will be over
60:30 - here naturally
60:32 - so music is life it's an important part
60:34 - of her life
60:35 - as it is a way of expressing her
60:36 - feelings as well as emotions
60:39 - and there's a link to happy music and i
60:41 - assume this takes us to a youtube link
60:43 - because there's a youtube icon in it
60:45 - so i'm not really sure though what i
60:47 - guess
60:49 - it's it's uh maybe a curated playlist
60:52 - of happy music so i'm still confused
60:55 - about what exactly
60:58 - is happening here or what the purpose of
61:00 - this site is so i think you need to
61:01 - elaborate on that a little bit more
61:04 - coming down we have a lot of white space
61:07 - down here
61:08 - from the bottom of this section which is
61:10 - defined by this higher contrast element
61:12 - you know the these beats headphones but
61:15 - then we have this tiny bit right here
61:17 - it'll look a lot better if you take this
61:21 - padding using absolute pixel
61:24 - elements here and we jumped this up to
61:28 - like
61:30 - 10 m units and this already looks a lot
61:33 - better
61:34 - same thing right here we have this tiny
61:36 - little bit of white space
61:38 - i would scale down the size of this
61:39 - photograph quite a bit
61:42 - but what refresh i'm going to refresh
61:44 - and you'll see the original
61:47 - and it's just it feels so clamped and
61:50 - cluttered when you don't have enough
61:53 - white space
62:00 - all right what does everybody think this
62:02 - person should get for a rating
62:04 - one being the worst and 10 being the
62:06 - best
62:09 - somebody said how to hack facebook with
62:11 - html
62:12 - if somebody could do that they uh they
62:15 - deserve to be like a billionaire
62:17 - or something hacking facebook with html
62:22 - all right get your answers in
62:27 - 1 being the worst 10 being the best
62:31 - i know what i'm going to rate
62:41 - for me i'm going to give this a rating
62:43 - of
62:46 - 6.3 and i think that's pretty
62:50 - pretty fair of course i do because i
62:52 - gave it right
62:54 - and that is it for the
62:57 - reviews once again check out

63:16 - there teaching not just
63:17 - software like figma in adobe xd and all
63:20 - that
63:21 - but also the ui design fundamentals and
63:23 - a lot of projects will be worked in
63:25 - there we're going to have
63:26 - interactive ui design tests that will
63:29 - really help you develop the eye for all
63:31 - those ui design fundamentals live

63:52 - definitely check that out
63:54 - and that is it all right so thanks for
63:57 - stopping by
63:58 - if i rated your design and you got mad
64:01 - because i rated it low
64:03 - don't worry about it it's just a rating
64:05 - i'm only one guy
64:06 - so again if you want to improve
64:10 - check out i google
64:14 - uh all the ui design fundamentals i
64:16 - actually have courses free courses on my
64:18 - channel
64:19 - i released one earlier about ui design
64:22 - earlier this year so
64:23 - take all these resources and use them to
64:25 - get better
64:27 - also check out sites like dribbble.com
64:30 - those are going to help you with
64:32 - inspiration and just looking at other
64:34 - designs can help you
64:35 - figure things out even on a subconscious
64:38 - level
64:39 - and then taking it a step further if you
64:40 - see a design you really like
64:42 - just as a matter of practice go into ui
64:44 - design
64:45 - software whether that's figma or adobe
64:47 - xd
64:48 - and recreate it you know don't don't
64:50 - claim it's your own just as a matter of
64:52 - practice recreate the design that's
64:55 - going to help build in
64:56 - muscle memory so it's really interesting
64:58 - i play guitar
64:59 - i'm trying to learn if i'm ever trying
65:01 - to learn a crazy solo that's really fast
65:03 - or difficult or whatever
65:04 - when i first try it it's it's hard right
65:07 - but when i go to sleep and then the next
65:09 - day i try it
65:10 - all of a sudden it's just right there it
65:12 - your these neurons that
65:14 - are they're creating connections while
65:15 - you're sleeping or even if you just take
65:17 - a break for an hour
65:18 - it still happens even then so the design
65:21 - is the same
65:22 - way so for those of you who are
65:23 - struggling
65:25 - you have to you have to put in the time
65:27 - uh and you actually have to
65:28 - to do not just watch me or
65:32 - follow tutorials or watch the tours you
65:34 - have to do and i will stop
65:36 - at this point rambling on all right
65:38 - thanks a lot everybody and i will

Cleaned transcript:

hello hello hello hello everybody we are going to get started here momentarily we're just going to wait for people to filter in and i'm going to get a chat window up here just so i can get you all i'll try to mention your names i can never do it very well hello devops tech techier i'm from ohio in the united states hello hello quincy thanks for having me on again all right i'm going to increase this just a little bit more there we go all right so we're going to get started in about 30 to 60 seconds again i just want people to filter in a little bit more all right you can't see the workspace well hopefully you can right okay so let's go ahead and get started so the first thing i did a live stream here last week uh exactly one week ago at the same time and for those of you who missed it you don't know who i am i'm gary simon i've been a ui ux designer and a frontend developer for the last 20 years i've been doing the teaching thing for the last 10 years on my own youtube channel which you can check out right here so it's at youtube.com forward slash design course and you can subscribe up i do these live streams here on my channel i call it the negative space i'm going to be doing the same show essentially here and if you like this you know go ahead and subscribe up uh at my channel also designcourse.com that's my site i'm relaunching it in a few months time last week i did mention this site and i told you to enter your email if you want to be notified when that goes live and of course with my luck the server that the api endpoint was on at media temple completely went down so a lot of you tried to enter your email and it gave you an error message so again enter it and this time it will work assuming media temple servers stay up all right and in order to participate you need to go to twitter and you can tweet your user interface design this could be a live website it could be just a figma or adobe xd prototype i and also use the hashtag live ui ux review all this information should be in the description here in youtube all right so i'm not going to be taking these in any particular order i picked out a few initially and so what we're going to be doing is i'm going to be reviewing your ui designs and i'm going to be considering both user interface design and user experience design when i look at these so user interface design would mean i'm taking a look at things like white space alignment scale typography color and contrast in visual hierarchy and when it comes to user experience design or ux design i'm going to be asking myself you know it doesn't make sense to do this or that here uh is it going to be hard for the user to use is the verbiage you're using makes sense and so we'll also ask at the end of my little review i'll ask you who are watching in the chat here to give it a rating of one being the worst and 10 being the best i try not to look because i don't want you guys to poison the well and i'll give my rating afterwards and we'll see if we agree or not all right so the whole goal here is just to improve if i don't review your design don't worry about it that much it's not a big deal you're still going to gain a lot of insight based on what i have to say i what's happening with other people's submissions all right so i've picked out a few like i said initially and i'm just going to get started right here with this particular entry so when i look at this design let me push this over so we don't see the background there we go so when i look at this design what i immediately think is first of all there's not a lot of white space from this little graphic and the the top portion here so we can immediately push this whole section down away from the navigation up top second we're lacking what's called visual hierarchy now again this is a ui design fundamental it's not a ux topic i and i've talked about this before in my last stream but nailing your visual hierarchy is very important because what it means is i'm not sure exactly where i should look first when i consider all this text right here i'm not sure where to look so you need to use your ui design fundamentals such as scale color and contrast and alignment in order to reinforce that visual hierarchy or in other words direct the eye where you want to see it so let me just show you what i mean real quick if i get out the dev tools here and i take this element right here okay well what we could do is we can font weight bold it because i think this is going to be the most one of the most important parts this is kind of like the headline of the website right and i think we could also take color so color and contrast we're going to increase the contrast by making the color white so now all of a sudden we see this the eye is directed to this section much more than this stuff down here so now we have a place to actually look it's probably a little bit longer of a headline than i would want we could also probably slightly increase the font size so what's 2m that's a little bit too big maybe 1.3 m units maybe line height 1.3 m as well and now we really can see that this is an important element it's the one thing that we want people to to be able to see all right so next up after this impressed already hit this button and so i'm not going to hit it but it's it's basically a it's a mail to you know their email so it's going to open up my email client um i wouldn't advise doing that now this person is doing something witty which is i see you don't just hit random button on the internet good for you let me flex some of my skills you don't want to trick your visitors i understand you're trying to be unique and witty but you don't really want to trick your visitors because here's the problem sometimes somebody will quickly look at a site they might just read this headline and then see this button like why would i want to hit this button i'm exiting out of this site they're not going to bother reading this part down here where you said you don't just hit a random button so that's something to take into consideration the skills uh progress bar i talk about this a lot in fact i did a video today on my own youtube channel where i talk about the top 10 worst ui design trends of 2020 and this is this is actually one of them it's one of the recent ones that i've seen i you don't want to put a progress bar in my opinion on with your skills simply because what if somebody wants somebody who's proficient in c and they see when they stack it up against all your other skill sets it's gonna it only tells them that this person's not very good and here we go again okay okay i agree using progress bro for skills is not a really good idea so you're being witty but you might be confusing people because they may not read this all right so all in all uh that's my review here there's a lot more but i have to move on what do you people think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best by the way if i refresh this you'll see the original design and this is my changes to reinforce the visual hierarchy so if i refresh this you'll see you're not really sure where you should look first so let me know in the youtube chat one being the worst 10 being the best and we'll see if you guys agree with me and i'll give you about 15 seconds until i start seeing some roll in so i'm just kind of scrolling up here trying to think of what i would give this one personally i'm probably going to say around i could see all the comments on the side of my view my peripheral vision i'm not looking at your answers i'm going to go ahead and say a good old 5.3 or so all right so looking at these we have some eight seven five two five seven six six six five five okay yep uh pretty much around there we had some variants there quite a bit so another one that i wanted to review here is from this user right here so there's nothing wrong with absolute simplicity of course we have a lot of simplicity here we have a lot of white space there's just not much happening here one problem is is i we see we have hi i'm you know your name and then underneath it looks like a button i want to click on it but it's not a button so i might rethink that i would also work on and this is a ux specific idea the ad copy here i think you can probably do a little bit more with this area to fill it out um even also taking this left column here in this right column and trying to construct it in such a way that it fills out more of the user interface also there's no call to action this looks like it could be a call to action because it's a button but it's not but so there's not really a call to action if you want people to scroll down at least do the floating animated scroll down area i'm a fan of having buttons though just to give people something to click on to go right where you want them to outside of that we have another section right here now if you look at the code for this this is whole section there's like a i actually like the background here it's a really cool sort of you know very barely visible background it has nice texture to it it this whole section is set up on a height 100 viewport heights or 100 vh in css and that's good that's fine i like that but this section right here has not been centered vertically so we have all this unnecessary white space so you want to address that next up this is unnecessary this whole me thing because you already said about right here you have a title it says a little about me that's all you need so you don't want to be redundant in that sense so i would just delete that and then take this center it vertically so if you're using the grid that would be like place item or place content uh center and that'll automatically do it for you another thing i noticed this is something i see all the time unfortunately is on the this is a desktop view i this would be right here on a mobile device right where it makes sense to use a hamburger menu if you have enough links to justify it but out here you only have three different links the pro this is a ux issue you don't want people to have to unnecessarily click in order to access a navigation you only do that if you don't have enough physical room to give them access to so you only have home or wait me work find me just put those three right here that way people can click on them and access that quite quickly next up this part's not too bad there's no big ui or ux issues occurring here although um i guess if you only have two examples you can go ahead and fill them out but it might make more sense to put these maybe in a column of three and then list out more at the same time all right so that's my review here what do you think that this person should get for a rating one being the worst and ten being the absolute best you've ever seen i'll give you about 15 to 20 seconds all right i'm going to give this a rating of probably let's see there's not a lot of like really bad things happening here so i'm just going to do i like kind of this section here could improve on the contrast um i'm going to say a 6.1 maybe or so yeah there we go very good and by the way everybody please try not to spam don't give your same answer multiple times in the text chat it just clutters it up way too much it makes the life of the moderators difficult um so yeah just only mention your your answer once all right so next up i have another one that i wanted to showcase that somebody submitted all right so what's interesting about this example here is um two days ago i released a video about using photographs for your landing pages specifically like in the hero section of a landing page just like in this context and there's nothing wrong with doing this um i think they used it and they did it correctly because they did push the darkness on this image um well enough so that you can see the type sitting on top of it a lot of times people try to show you the full image without darkening it and then it's hard to read everything on top so they did that well um but if you do want to see alternative more modern ways to approach this type of design this type of layout check my video um because i show a way to do this so that you have a full nice vibrant image that is seamless and kind of worked into the user interface but for what this is welcome to foodika visit blogs i would probably fill this out with a little bit more content and maybe a sub headline at the very least visit blogs i'm not sure you know where this would take me exactly so apparently this is a blog and this is what you want people to end up on right here the most i actually like the design it's pretty solid from what i see here but it does make me wonder if you really want people to go to the blog why do you have kind of like a splash page really i mean i would take him straight to the content as much as possible so coming down here chef's choice weekly special click here okay so i'm trying i'm still kind of confused about what this is exactly like the purpose of the site and so that sometimes that's a ux issue as well sometimes that gets lost and you really want to address this information as much as possible let me close out my my email client um outside of that just looking at the ui design it's itself it's pretty solid here there's some minute things um for instance we have a certain amount of white space between these two columns but then over here it's like half it's really a good idea to use consistent white space especially in the same section between columns and rows so that's a really small gripe also another small gripe i have down here looking at this email form submit there's a nice allaround wellapplied white space within this button around the text however if we come over here just slightly i'll increase the size one thing that throws things off these are very new small things but if you if you have a lot of them on a design it's just it's not going to look good and you may not know why but what i would do in this case there's not enough white space on the left right here compared to the top and the bottom as well as what's applied over here so that's very small my new issue that is worth and it's easy to address so if we see padding the element is right here maybe we can put one m unit 1m on the left so now that small change just brings everything together so if i refresh this you'll see what it goes back to it's just slightly off all right so that is my review for this one what do you people think that this person should get for a rating one being the worst you've ever seen and 10 being the best you have 15 to 20 seconds so let's see me what would i give this i mean this is a nice photograph it is up here i'm not too happy about uh position fixed backgrounds here i think it's a little bit disorienting to people so i probably wouldn't do that but this is pretty solid overall probably going to be our highest rated one so far to the point so i'm going to give this one a let's see a seven just a straight up seven i think would work pretty well for that example all right so i have a couple more that i just chose before we began and then i'll start looking at the twitter feed for the hashtag all right so there's a number of issues with this particular example and in this case i would say the person who designed this really needs to understand those ui design fundamentals that i mentioned before because a lot of this is ui design based not necessarily ux based so like a like i mentioned at the beginning of the stream white space alignment scale typography color and contrast and visual hierarchy you need to understand all of those and then gain practice applying them so first and foremost we have a navigation up here but then we have this small amount of text kind of really close so there's an issue of a lack of white space first and foremost and there's also i it doesn't really make sense also from a ux standpoint to have this type right here when you have a headline and then a sub headline over here so it feels very disconnected and this just seems randomly placed so what i would do is i would take this whole section and i would oh and by the way just a front end development tip here you don't want to have like two h1s here for this these would probably be the best used as like paragraph tags right here so i would remove those so now we simplify the top that looks better and it makes more sense also you want to make sure as much as you can you want to make sure that your design is working well responsively and notice this button it's touching the edge here and it just doesn't look very good in this case so you want to fix that as much as possible next up there's an issue with visual hierarchy in the topography so yes this is bigger and this is slightly smaller but it's still not separated enough visually so i would reduce the scale here and maybe even make the font weight normal and not bold and then that you see that clear separation between those two elements and the view my work is unnecessarily large you're going to want to take that down quite a bit also i would say this area this little blob sort of bezier curve it doesn't look 100 smooth to me it looks like somebody took this into maybe an illustrator a vector drawing application and where you place and how you place the anchor points is very important when it comes to creating these very smooth blob effects so i would just i try to remedy that as well your navigation too much white space in between each individual link you'd want to fix that and yeah so that's just uh my quick review of this landing page what do you people think this person should get for a rating one being the worst in 10 being the best i don't agree that it's a seven i want you i want to judge how it currently is for me i think it will give this one a rating of yeah it's going to have to be a little bit on the lower side just because there's a lot of issues so i'm going to give this one a flat 4. yes i think that's fair enough now if you fixed all those issues that i mentioned yeah you can bump this up to like a 7 or so or 7.5 based on the content that is here and how it's presented all right seems like most of you agree all right next up there's one more that i had that was preplanned here all right so a couple issues right away that i'm noticing are this graphic right here look how close it is to the navigation you know you definitely want to give that white space there's nothing worse than something that's just like sitting there in the navigation or right next to it that's just taking focus away so margin top you know maybe seven m units there we go that's a lot better looks a thousand times better next up we have the headline in the sub headline those are in terms of typogra strictly speaking of typography those are done well this is light this is bold and it's also larger so it's done well but i would say there's probably a little bit too much white space between both of these and then next up here's here's a ux issue i this doesn't make sense in my opinion it doesn't make sense to use this little linkedin embed right here for a few reasons first of all it doesn't really quite fit this design i i understand that you you want them to go to your linkedin but at the same time you already have a linkedin right here along with all of your other elements and so if you really want them to go to your linkedin i would simply put a button like this and that's it i want to put this whole thing right here and that way it would really help the flow of your design a lot better because this just does it seems out of place right here um next up all right so i actually like this section here um where we have the two columns right here and i strive for i i like that that's really set up well but i would say there's an issue with color there's also an issue with um you making this the description bold and making that kind of stand out more rather than the title of each or the label of each of these four sections so let me show you real quickly how i would refactor this particular design so first of all it's kind of also hard on the eyes a little bit too hard on the eye so i would change this color to maybe something that's a darker desaturated bluish or so i like that um and then inside of it we'll take these elements and we'll do color white and we're also going to font weight bold those now i know it looks ugly right now but don't worry we're going to fix all of that and then you might want to say okay maybe we'll make the color white here and that's fine but you know what we could still increase the or improve the visual hierarchy of this section because these being 100 white and these being 100 white kind of makes a little bit hard to quickly scan this area so what i would do is instead of making it white here's my little trick we take the color picker and you could do this in figma or adobe xd if you're working in a prototyping software or design we take the background that's sitting on now of course it's hidden now i like to take the color picker and just go up a little bit and notice where it says i'm not sure if you can see it here color con color it says contrast ratio 3.14 you want to get that up into where it this gives you a positive reading a check mark so right there is probably the minimum double a and this is according to the wcag 2.0 color contrast guidelines i know that's kind of like a word solid there look it up i've done videos on this you want to make sure you have a minimum level of contrast and that way you'll have a much more accessible design for those who have visual impairments so like right around there would be pretty good i like that so look at this i i like this a lot better compared to what it was before i'm going to refresh and show you the original so this is what i had and now look at the original so this is just kind of harder to read in my opinion if you wanted to keep the same background color you can but at least bold these up and make these uh not quite as bold as they are or just make this a lot bolder all right so that's my quick review here for this design what does everyone think this person should get for a rating one being the worst in 10 being the absolute best i'm going to make an adjustment to myself real quick while you get your answers in there i wanted to improve myself the color was off with me all right so for this one i'm going to go ahead and give this a rating of yeah i think this is a solid 6.3 so yes i am using the point systems i'm getting a little bit more specific 10 just isn't enough or just using the ones place all right so it seems like a negative 10. that's not nice all right okay so yeah it seems like yep you're welcome let's go ahead and look at some of the ones that have been submitted here so let me refresh this and we'll check out just a few of these um and see what how i can do this off the cuff which i i do this for the most part um this is i'm going to try to find sites or examples that are live on in the browser because i like to also just see it fully realized as opposed to a prototype most of the time um okay gary please review this one uh so this is an aesthetic like a makeup company all right all right okay so first thing the first thing that in a good thing is if i have to sit and stare out of design for a while in order to find something really wrong that's a good thing but there is something that i think could definitely be approved here and that is the orientation the layout of this form also there could be accessibility issues because if this is just an email placeholder for the label it gets hidden i mentioned this in the last stream i have to mention it every time i do one of these live streams because too many people rely on the placeholder value as a label but the problem is once you start typing in it the label goes away and then sometimes people they might get up from their computer and come back they forget what is this form field i have no clue what i'm doing here so it's always nice to have at least a floating label i in you can't go wrong when you're actually using a label element in html because it will never be hidden all right all right next up when you have just three elements form elements like this having them float next to each other like one here one here and then your name right here and then request it makes more sense to collapse those all each on their own row so that way it's a lot more easy for people to fill out and just scan with their eyes so i wouldn't agree with having these in two different columns outside of that let me scroll down see what else is happening here all right i think you could probably increase the size or at least the positioning so you have this card here you want to take this and make sure that this centered vertically within that card same thing here i would probably increase the visual hierarchy here or improve it by taking these elements on the left and making them bold and that way you can easily separate them from the prices over here and there is a lot of kind of card based design there's a lot of type here so i might think about possibly restructuring that to make it a little bit less i don't know maybe i'm wrong about that um i just i think it probably be improved visually if you bold these up over here and you center things over here the type is a little bit small in areas like right here chin cheek and nose i thought that said check for a second a little bit small on the small side so you definitely want to rethink that possibly maybe increase it um i really like the type you're definitely reinforcing that that higher end feel uh this this feels luxurious to me and that's kind of what serif fonts tend to do but so i think that's done well there's good white space here inside of these containers so that's all working out well you might want to separate this section right here with the about section in a different content container perhaps maybe making this part like a lighter color maybe even white or close to it and that way it kind of gives more structure to the layout having them inside of individual containers all right and then same comment with the uh this this area right here um make sure you're using labels or at least floating labels all right what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best also i'd probably try to increase the quality of your photo here you can tell there's some decent pixelation here so definitely look into that i'm going to give this one a let's think here i'm going to give it a 6.9 and it seems like most of you are agreeing with that already all right who is next up let's see here let me scroll down just because i don't want to people i want to make it random like i don't want to do only the latest submitted so i'm just going to scroll down randomly and then just check some of these out um let's see here i've been doing a lot of portfolios so i kind of want to change that up first project somebody's first project i'm going to move it off screen first and then check it out okay now this is your first project i'm hoping that it's not based on a template because if i'm if i'm reviewing designs i don't want to base it on a template um that somebody created already so i'm just going to make the assumption that this is not a template the reason i say that because if it's your first design this is actually pretty good for somebody's first design so looking at this there's some um let's see here strange things happening just because we have no navigation that's the only reason i say that now you don't always need a navigation if you have an extremely simple onepage site you know maybe you have one purpose and that's it so maybe that's the case here again once again we have this issue with the forms i'm going to assume these aren't floating you can never know until you click inside of it to see if they somehow float up so if i do full name yeah unfortunately they're hidden also i wouldn't make the actual type white because white on this light gray is not enough contrast i guarantee that would that would fail the contrast checker so you want to use labels here um also this doesn't make sense to me right here having the contact button right outside of the container right here that i would not do that also i would not use this gray color right here this it's kind of like a mid mid gray eye for using as like uh colors like for like backgrounds and stuff like the background of this little card here almost never works it's very hard to make it look good so i would change that color to something else so for instance i would take get out of there i i dealt with this last time okay there he goes so i would take this background and i would make it something that fits you know you're using this color right here we could use that that looks better already just that change you could go darker maybe it will create a little bit more saturation or you know i probably say this one is if you're gonna do this that would be best and then also i would change uh let me change that again really quickly um also i would change the gray here uh that doesn't that what that because it's great now it doesn't really look that good so i don't see the background property for this let's see if i can still change it so if i change background no don't do that i was just typing blue so i have access to the color picker i would take this and maybe make it darker probably make it a little bit darker like that and then fix up the color here as well because the gray doesn't fit very well so if i refresh we'll see the original and i'm just not a big fan of that one right there outside of that looking at this this is pretty good right here you can read it we have a lot of borders borders are one of those things that are for the most part outdated but it's not horrible here um so i'm just clicking on this all right so there's not much else i can do i can't scroll down so i will conclude this rating a one being the worst time being the best what do you think this person should receive yeah you're right you know we could actually because this is the call to action right here we could make this stand out look a lot more we could take the the blue this color this button put it inside here and then make it like orange or we can make this whole section really stick out and make it orange as well because orange is a good complementary color uh to to blue i mean yeah to like a blue color here so um now of course the gray inside of it really makes it look ugly but that could definitely work so for this i'm going to give this a rating for what it is and also especially considering if this is really something they did from scratch it's their first design it's it's pretty impressive but as it is not considering that as it stands i'm probably going to give this a just a flat sometimes i i get stalled like 5.9 or so but considering it's their first design if they designed it i i have to give it like an eight or nine uh for a first time for sure you should see some of my stuff back in the late 90s when i started not good all right so next up i let's see here let's come up here down i'm trying to stay away from portfolios just because there's so many portfolios i've done already let's see so there's so many portfolios this one might not be a portfolio so let me check all right so we'll really quickly spend some time on this one this one needs a lot of work um first of all you don't want to have your image here not being fluid you don't want this to happen next up we have an issue with contrast you can't hardly read this remember i talked about using backgrounds photographs as backgrounds you want to push them off so they're water marks so you decrease the brightness and you darken the whole thing and then that way we can see what's up you don't want to make um this sort of thing comic sans uh and mix your typefaces so that's bad topography right there you don't want to have glows on them as well on your text it pretty much will never turn out looking well um we also have an issue here um with just the cards being spaced out like this and kind of disconnected with the type underneath it not being encased in them so yeah we're not going to bother with a rating for this one just because there's really not enough there but i in that kind of case definitely go back to the basics in terms of ui design and learn about all those fundamentals that i mentioned before next up i this is a project that is designed to develop for a startup company so let's check that out always moving it off to the side of the screen just to be safe okay now looking at this okay so we have the logos already here and i will say now i've been i was an identity designer a logo designer uh and that's all i did for about five to six years of my career and i've i've designed countless logos and i can say right now that this logo needs to be rethought because this looks like it says peeve not speed this s is too abstract so i i'm not sure if you have control over this or if this is your your project but i would definitely change that because that's an issue people are going to think your business name is peeve so outside of that in terms of uh ux and your your ad copy uh that you're using or your your web copy speed does not make sense here um i would this is first of all in terms of the visual hierarchy you're placing all the emphasis on the name and i don't think that makes sense to me the emphasis should be on the headline and identifying what exactly is happening here what is this business about what is this website about welcome to the world of faster deliveries that's what we want to know we don't want to have this huge emphasis this big white container with the business name so i would change that the discover more when you hover over it i would get rid of that uh the drop shadow it just it doesn't work well in my opinion it just adds unnecessary uh clutter or if you're going to do it make it be more of an afterthought don't make it be so obvious as it is um coming down oh also the navigation i wouldn't have an underline under every single nav item maybe the one that you're currently on like this is the home page or the about page i'm not sure which it's obviously the home page or whatever um but not every single one of them just because the big thick borders add unnecessary clutter also there's been a lot of there's been several studies about people expecting the a home link uh in your navigation people expect to see a home button so they can get back to the home page or what they perceive as being the home page so that's also something just to think about people want to see a home button scrolling down here all right so now i scroll down we're left with just this for quite a while which is a big empty area so i would make this come in quicker also this is too large on this resolution at least i'm not sure how responsive it is and it's not responsive so the layout breaks i'm not sure if maybe you didn't get to that part yet because this looks like it's designed only for desktop so you definitely want to fix that if that's something that you haven't considered we have issues with the topography and the visual hierarchy what we do is more which is the label that needs to be the thing that catches people's eye their eye the most i this yeah this is way too large you don't want it overlapping need more white space also has alignment issues so there's a lot happening here that could definitely be fixed this is probably the best part i kind of like this although i would have more white space away from the center line here all right so that is my rating one being the worst 10 being the best what do you people think this person deserves i'll give you about 15 to 20 seconds i will be doing this for about 15 more minutes or so and then we will conclude what do i want to give this design i'm personally thinking somewhere in the fives the type is just way too large i mean this could be cut down way down way way way way down along with these icons here as well by like hundreds of percent down i'm going to give this one just a flat 5.0 maybe 4.6 or 4.9 or so seems like most of you are disagreeing with me you think it should be rated higher okay well that's okay not everybody can be 100 right like me i kid all right uh let's go up back top here and i'll check out some of these that were submitted um let's see here we'll do latest okay so here is a esport site i did all right um it's in a different language so i'm going to use the google translate option or at least i'm going to try to all right we have some we have quite a bit of animation occurring here all right so let's refresh this now it's an esports site so we have to take that into consideration um when i'm doing this review because you know the logo being intense the animation intents in the background video being intense you know that's more forgivable and acceptable um or maybe even warranted um given the nature of the site and what it's about having said that i would say there's probably a little bit too much animation occurring in the background so it's a little bit disorienting looking at this so you could still keep the video based background but i would probably try to choose clips that are a little bit less in motion all right so reduced motion also i do think though that they've done a very good job of making it more of a watermark and decreasing the contrast and making it a desaturated 100 percent grayscale so that works quite well the logo placement i would like to see it up a little bit higher because it's kind of further down on the page and also you're missing something that's really important in my opinion yeah we know this is about esports because it says it here in your logo however what else is about we need to be a little bit more specific and use all this space wisely um because every page should have a goal and so i don't know what i'm supposed to do here i don't know what type this is like is this a is this news is this a news site is this um is this like a of a person or a company that has esport events like i'm not really sure what's happening here just yet or is this a team like is this an esports like clan i used to be i used to play quake 2 like crazy and i was in clans back then this is back in late 90s and early 2000s so i think we need to address what exactly this site is about a little bit more in this area but overall there's some cool things happening here issue with alignment if we we can see right here it says sun we have the title subtitle but then pushed over about 20 pixels is the description you want those to be on the same exact column also um i would work with the i'll probably put this in all into a paragraph and i would not separate them with lines right here because it just looks a little bit too disconnected and a little bit too dis uh a little bit too unorganized all right so what do you think this should be click on matches somebody wants me to click on matches all right one issue here the match with this little logo hard to see um nonetheless i'm not going to review the whole site though we don't have enough time for that one being the worst 10 being the best let me know in the comments what you think esports automatically zero oh wait it looks like oh i thought this was fixed it was based on like scroll position i'm going to give this right here i'm going to give this a rating of a 6.3 or so some people i tell you just because you spam it 20 times 10 doesn't make it 10. i'm sorry all right okay let's continue on my first commercially used website oh okay i love this i love these types here all right i'm going to this is another one i have to translate if you hear a strange noise in the background that is the garage door opening up right now underneath me it'll be done in a second all right so hair stylist all right so another video background this one this background seems to be pretty decent because it is darker and you can clearly see the elements on top of it um i still need something more to be desired in this area where it just says hair stylist and then the name of the hair stylist i might want to do something a little bit more unique or include these but have these be like sub elements or subtitles and then use something like this size for an actual headline that says something very interesting and pertinent or relevant about your business i'm coming down here this section right here seems like um it could definitely use improvement on the topography side of things so like this wow we're using font properties here font size 2m units margin bottom okay that's not working sometimes these aren't working well depending on which element i'm choosing who are using brs i wouldn't use the break elements as well but i would push this down as well and maybe even restructure this um what i would do this stuff right here i probably push i would take this whole car this whole section and put it down beneath the about me section or even down further and also a nice thing to do is i all this location information is to maybe embed like a google maps area maybe in the right column and then have this situated to the left column outside of that more white space above this section because these are two different sections you have about me and what i offer so i put more white space or margin top on this element to separate it out more um coming down all right so it's fine you use placeholders as long as you do have labels and this person does have labels so that's good um sometimes though i think you don't need to have the placeholder value if you're dealing with obvious form elements such as the email and the subject it just seems repetitive in my opinion and it does clutter it up unnecessarily send button i would probably get rid of the the white outline all right one being the worst 10 being the best what do you all believe this person should receive as a rating a abd you saw jean or whatever your name is please stop doing that don't spam i'm going to give this one here and this is hey this is a great job for your first commercially accepted you know live website so you're definitely on the right track i'm going to give this one a 6.5 or so all right next up we'll probably do one more or so depending on the time that we have left we have about six minutes all right i'm coming down this is a well i don't want to deal with figma links honestly just because we have so many that we can choose not a portfolio all right okay it is not a portfolio very good okay so speaking of trends um these trends i i forget what was it um i forget the website name where you can find many of these type of design illustrations which are fine to use but i think because so many people use them they're overused now and you can never go wrong uh trying to use something that's more unique um but still this works well for what it is looking at the rest of this i see a lot of blue and not much variation in the type um in terms of the color at least i think we could possibly improve that a little bit by changing this maybe possibly making this darker or making this text darker outside of that though the it is i like how it's set up this is set up pretty well um in terms of the size and the visual hierarchy um again like i said everything's just blue i think a little bit of variation would help in one way or the other now here's a good thing two different sections right here separated by this background a good amount of equal consistent white space between the top of this element in this section right here and the bottom of these elements and where this section ends right here so that's that's one of those small things that really helps out a design i like this nice blue a lot smaller sub labels or subtitle i should say versus the title and this right here is a little description all three of these elements are designed differently in terms of topography and that really helps it out a lot now this part seems kind of disconnected to me um i don't know why okay everything up to this point has been within this container with a column starting here and then a column ending here but then this is it breaks out of the columns structure and i don't like that so this shouldn't be based on fluid this should these should all be moved together uh inside of the same container you would still have white space between them but not as much buy now button should stick out more make that white not this background color that way it will really stick out as an option to click and then down here i would probably just make this bold maybe darker all right what do you think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best quincy yes uh you're right i it's just i i've seen them these these images so much i but yeah on draw.ceo is exactly what i was thinking there are so many of those illustrations it's it's insane i'm not even sure if like are they perhaps using some sort of like ai generated or something because there's so many of them it's it's insane i i like them it's just one of those things that i see everybody using and you're right a victim of our own success for this one i'm going to go ahead and give i really like this section here this is like the best design section simple but it works well i'm going to go ahead and give this one a 7.1 yeah oh this time quincy gave a less a lesser rating all right we're gonna do one more and then we'll go ahead and wrap this up so i'm gonna come back up and refresh all right um who do i want to try now um a music website this this person said it's their first music website and so because i consider myself a hobby musician we're gonna check that out really sad news yesterday one of the greatest guitar players eddie van halen died unfortunately if you go to my twitter you can see me playing attempting to play the eruption solo from van halen so definitely check that out shameless plug all right um okay we so we have alignment issues here right away the logo which i like it's very simple starts here but then everything breaks out outside of it and we have another columns right here this right here should all start on this line this column this invisible column that's set the tone is set right there by this right here so move that into the left and then also take these headphones which i like this this background move that over to the right as well you'll have to because this will be over here naturally so music is life it's an important part of her life as it is a way of expressing her feelings as well as emotions and there's a link to happy music and i assume this takes us to a youtube link because there's a youtube icon in it so i'm not really sure though what i guess it's it's uh maybe a curated playlist of happy music so i'm still confused about what exactly is happening here or what the purpose of this site is so i think you need to elaborate on that a little bit more coming down we have a lot of white space down here from the bottom of this section which is defined by this higher contrast element you know the these beats headphones but then we have this tiny bit right here it'll look a lot better if you take this padding using absolute pixel elements here and we jumped this up to like 10 m units and this already looks a lot better same thing right here we have this tiny little bit of white space i would scale down the size of this photograph quite a bit but what refresh i'm going to refresh and you'll see the original and it's just it feels so clamped and cluttered when you don't have enough white space all right what does everybody think this person should get for a rating one being the worst and 10 being the best somebody said how to hack facebook with html if somebody could do that they uh they deserve to be like a billionaire or something hacking facebook with html all right get your answers in 1 being the worst 10 being the best i know what i'm going to rate for me i'm going to give this a rating of 6.3 and i think that's pretty pretty fair of course i do because i gave it right and that is it for the reviews once again check out designcourse.com enter your email to be notified when i release this it's going to be a really exhaustive just comprehensive way to learn all the stuff i'm talking about ui and ux design full courses are going to be worked in there teaching not just software like figma in adobe xd and all that but also the ui design fundamentals and a lot of projects will be worked in there we're going to have interactive ui design tests that will really help you develop the eye for all those ui design fundamentals live workshops challenges all of it so that's coming in several months time enter your email to be notified check out my youtube channel it's a design course youtube.com forward slash design course i do this live show several times per month um i'm going to be doing it in two days as well on friday on my own channel so definitely check that out and that is it all right so thanks for stopping by if i rated your design and you got mad because i rated it low don't worry about it it's just a rating i'm only one guy so again if you want to improve check out i google uh all the ui design fundamentals i actually have courses free courses on my channel i released one earlier about ui design earlier this year so take all these resources and use them to get better also check out sites like dribbble.com those are going to help you with inspiration and just looking at other designs can help you figure things out even on a subconscious level and then taking it a step further if you see a design you really like just as a matter of practice go into ui design software whether that's figma or adobe xd and recreate it you know don't don't claim it's your own just as a matter of practice recreate the design that's going to help build in muscle memory so it's really interesting i play guitar i'm trying to learn if i'm ever trying to learn a crazy solo that's really fast or difficult or whatever when i first try it it's it's hard right but when i go to sleep and then the next day i try it all of a sudden it's just right there it your these neurons that are they're creating connections while you're sleeping or even if you just take a break for an hour it still happens even then so the design is the same way so for those of you who are struggling you have to you have to put in the time uh and you actually have to to do not just watch me or follow tutorials or watch the tours you have to do and i will stop at this point rambling on all right thanks a lot everybody and i will
