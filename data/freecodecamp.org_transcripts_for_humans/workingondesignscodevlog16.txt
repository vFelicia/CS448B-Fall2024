With timestamps:

00:00 - this week I'll have two moments in order
00:02 - to focus on the next projects that's why
00:05 - I want to focus on their design and how
00:07 - they should be built first
00:10 - [Music]
00:46 - making s list is important when you care
00:48 - about the order in this leaderboard I
00:51 - care about the order however in the
00:54 - recipe
00:55 - box well not so much the order isn't so
00:58 - important and when it comes to the
01:01 - recipes however what's important is how
01:05 - they finally look how they taste that's
01:08 - why that I would go for grge and in
01:10 - leaderboard I would go for a list
01:14 - [Music]
02:01 - I used to say I
02:04 - [Music]
02:09 - was I used to say I
02:13 - [Music]
02:18 - was the leader board does this to build
02:20 - a list that is talkable a user must be
02:23 - able to talk between uh the leaders uh
02:26 - depending on the time period whether
02:29 - it's all time or whether it's just only
02:32 - the last 30 days in order to toggle I
02:34 - would use the tub and I'm still
02:37 - wondering whether to keep the place
02:39 - number to the right if you put the
02:41 - number on the left still from the design
02:44 - perspective the Avatar which is the face
02:47 - will bring the fast attention so maybe
02:50 - it'll be better to keep the aat first
02:55 - and so to the left because people read
02:58 - like f pattern or left class in the
03:00 - lists so they read uh in the line later
03:04 - they go down they uh scan another line
03:08 - so at the end of each line they will see
03:09 - the number like one two three four maybe
03:13 - that would be better I will prepare some
03:15 - varieties because of the fact that it is
03:18 - the free code scan board I will use
03:21 - their color their greenish
03:23 - color and this will be my main uh theme
03:27 - color in this leaderboard design
03:30 - generally I would like to keep it clean
03:32 - and as wise as possible because it gives
03:35 - the impression of space especially if
03:38 - you have a list that's really
03:40 - homogeneous and the items repeat each
03:44 - item on the list will have to be a link
03:46 - so we have to be clickable I want to
03:50 - make it
03:53 - as interactive as possible so I want to
03:56 - redirect the users whenever they click
03:58 - any reader whenever they touch any
04:01 - leader uh on the list and I want to
04:04 - redirect them to this leaders who was
04:09 - chosen to to their Freo Camp account
04:13 - this is the first version of the design
04:15 - of fre Camp leaders board and the app uh
04:19 - should allow for toing between
04:22 - leaderboards according to the time span
04:25 - so by default I will have displayed uh
04:28 - less 30 days and a user can also go to
04:32 - alltime leaders where the total points
04:36 - um will be
04:37 - highlighted on the right there's
04:39 - additional information which is the
04:41 - number uh on the list um so I was
04:44 - wondering whether to put them to the
04:46 - left this is just the Prototype I want
04:49 - to make um the whole item here the whole
04:52 - line clickable and redirecting to a
04:56 - given user so whenever I click some
04:59 - James uh here in this line whether it
05:03 - would be an avatar or the line here um I
05:07 - want to make this whole um area
05:11 - clickable so to make this whole area the
05:13 - whole line clickable for a user to be
05:17 - redirector to to be redirected to free
05:20 - code Scamp um users um profile and uh
05:26 - this way this app should be more more
05:30 - interactive because then they can go to
05:32 - this uh Twitter GitHub LinkedIn they can
05:36 - see their
05:37 - activity right now I have the design on
05:41 - mobile um horizontally
05:44 - vertically um and also on uh tablet
05:50 - screens as well as on
05:54 - desktop I was considering the option of
05:56 - putting two columns on the wider screen
05:59 - such as on tablets or on uh the desktop
06:05 - however
06:07 - um scanning patterns of a list is like
06:11 - from top to bottom and the numbers uh
06:14 - should go from one to this 100 down
06:18 - therefore I decided to keep one column
06:20 - but Center it and simply make it very
06:25 - similar on all devices generally what
06:27 - changes on iPads tablets
06:31 - and desktops is that uh I keep two lines
06:36 - with the information next to the
06:38 - Avatar not free as on mobile phones um
06:44 - vertically this is the first draft and
06:48 - um let's start with it later we will see
06:51 - what happens during the codes
06:52 - implementation
06:53 - [Music]
07:03 - I love it rating over the projects and
07:05 - this is what I did with this one uh with
07:08 - free Cod Camp leaderboard um because the
07:12 - first design
07:14 - like these numbers on the right well
07:18 - finally I decided that uh they are
07:20 - important enough to be kept but not as
07:25 - to be big as the avatars that's why I
07:27 - kept them Smalls uh small as you see
07:30 - here uh so I will put the relative
07:32 - position and later later absolute it
07:34 - should work and I will put the numbers
07:38 - uh to the left corner of the avatars so
07:42 - this way the position in the leaderboard
07:44 - would be pretty visible but not more
07:47 - important than the faces than the
07:49 - avatars of the people H and
07:53 - um what I did also in this red design is
07:58 - that I would put the if it's like last
08:02 - 30 days so the last 30 days points will
08:05 - be here uh to the right this way it
08:08 - rating um you can reach better result I
08:11 - believe that's better solution I added
08:13 - the italic style to the points that
08:15 - aren't the most important in a given
08:18 - tuab so if we are in the last 30 days
08:21 - the total points so the points from all
08:24 - time they're in italics the reason for
08:27 - that is to still keep them um but to
08:30 - diminish their importance
08:32 - [Music]
09:19 - it's Friday I start the day with looking
09:21 - for the inspiration so I'm looking for
09:24 - the inspiration for the design and
09:26 - looking how other people do different
09:29 - cookbooks some recipe apps and I started
09:33 - with codeb and looking what other co-
09:36 - campers did in the final code I don't
09:40 - want to use bootstrap again because it's
09:42 - a pretty simple thing to do I will try
09:46 - to practice my flexbook skills once
09:48 - again and it will be more challenging
09:51 - for sure but more much more fun I will
09:54 - want to do it not just on eMobile first
09:57 - but this time I will also have a look
09:59 - maybe at this offline first I'm also a
10:02 - fan of cooking and you know I'm really a
10:04 - foodie this is also one of the reasons I
10:07 - live here in Spain right now that's why
10:10 - this project seems also more exciting
10:12 - than the rest and I ran the food book um
10:17 - so I keep my recipes also online I don't
10:20 - have a lot of time right now to do it
10:22 - but I love culinary photography that's
10:24 - why this project is pretty fun for me so
10:28 - let's get back to work back
10:30 - [Music]
11:07 - I used to say I
11:10 - [Music]
11:16 - was I used to say I
11:19 - [Music]
11:25 - was I used to say I was
11:35 - I used to say I
11:38 - [Music]
11:43 - was I used to say I
11:47 - [Music]
11:52 - was I used to say I was sin
11:57 - [Music]
12:20 - this is the design of the recipe box
12:22 - this time I focus mostly just only on
12:23 - the mobile because uh the um wider
12:27 - screens will be pretty simp aot so I
12:30 - focused uh on the material design here
12:33 - on the cards and on the specs additional
12:36 - specs that I built so in um experience
12:40 - design I also added the user stories uh
12:43 - that this project will have to meet um
12:46 - the resour stores come from fre Cod Camp
12:48 - of course I tried to define the user and
12:53 - the
12:54 - technology um but also the extra stuff
12:57 - that can be done about this app
13:00 - probably in the first situation I'll
13:01 - just introduce um some of them and then
13:06 - let's go to the design I want to make it
13:09 - in a great system uh this will be the
13:11 - home screen with the uh with the index
13:15 - so the recipes should be visible as you
13:18 - see them
13:19 - alphabetically uh they should be
13:21 - distributed this way so we have bread
13:23 - chocolate camon roll scumble whenever
13:26 - you click the uh whenever you click the
13:29 - recipe you go to detail view when you
13:31 - scroll you go to the bottom of it so you
13:35 - have the ingredients you have
13:36 - instructions and later you can edit it
13:38 - or you can delete it uh when you edit
13:42 - it uh you will go to uh to the addit
13:46 - view you can also delete the
13:49 - recipe uh and there will be Rance for
13:52 - user if they really want to delete it or
13:55 - not if they click delete they will
14:00 - deleted from the list it was here so
14:02 - crumble was here after cins but right
14:05 - now uh it's deleted because I um deleted
14:08 - it uh from the home view they will be
14:12 - able to add the new recipe uh and save
14:16 - it so on the phones um horizontally I
14:20 - want to do one more column and on tablet
14:23 - I want to add one extra column which
14:25 - will be also kept on desktops but here
14:29 - um I want to move the Fab um to the top
14:34 - that's why I also changed the color to
14:37 - differentiate this FB from the rest I
14:40 - also designed the home screen empty
14:42 - state so I'm not sure about
14:46 - the I'm not sure about this text yet but
14:52 - uh whenever there's no recipe there
14:55 - should be some hand for a user uh to to
14:59 - use the button and to do something maybe
15:01 - I will add some um some nice picture
15:05 - here um plus the text to make it more
15:09 - juicy next week I'm going to start one
15:12 - of these projects probably it will be
15:14 - the leaderboard keep on doing and see
15:17 - you next week and stay tuned because
15:19 - there will be a big news coming to this
15:20 - channel really soon
15:23 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

this week I'll have two moments in order to focus on the next projects that's why I want to focus on their design and how they should be built first making s list is important when you care about the order in this leaderboard I care about the order however in the recipe box well not so much the order isn't so important and when it comes to the recipes however what's important is how they finally look how they taste that's why that I would go for grge and in leaderboard I would go for a list I used to say I was I used to say I was the leader board does this to build a list that is talkable a user must be able to talk between uh the leaders uh depending on the time period whether it's all time or whether it's just only the last 30 days in order to toggle I would use the tub and I'm still wondering whether to keep the place number to the right if you put the number on the left still from the design perspective the Avatar which is the face will bring the fast attention so maybe it'll be better to keep the aat first and so to the left because people read like f pattern or left class in the lists so they read uh in the line later they go down they uh scan another line so at the end of each line they will see the number like one two three four maybe that would be better I will prepare some varieties because of the fact that it is the free code scan board I will use their color their greenish color and this will be my main uh theme color in this leaderboard design generally I would like to keep it clean and as wise as possible because it gives the impression of space especially if you have a list that's really homogeneous and the items repeat each item on the list will have to be a link so we have to be clickable I want to make it as interactive as possible so I want to redirect the users whenever they click any reader whenever they touch any leader uh on the list and I want to redirect them to this leaders who was chosen to to their Freo Camp account this is the

user can also go to alltime leaders where the total points um will be highlighted on the right there's additional information which is the number uh on the list um so I was wondering whether to put them to the left this is just the Prototype I want to make um the whole item here the whole line clickable and redirecting to a given user so whenever I click some James uh here in this line whether it would be an avatar or the line here um I want to make this whole um area clickable so to make this whole area the whole line clickable for a user to be redirector to to be redirected to free code Scamp um users um profile and uh this way this app should be more more interactive because then they can go to this uh Twitter GitHub LinkedIn they can see their activity right now I have the design
