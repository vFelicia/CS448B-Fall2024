00:00 - hey it's prey again and I'm back with
00:03 - the ask prey series and this is week
00:05 - number two um this week's question is a
00:08 - very interesting one and one that I
00:09 - actually get pretty commonly and so
00:11 - let's go ahead and read it he says I've
00:14 - been teaching myself to Cod for almost a
00:16 - year now I initially started from free
00:17 - code camp and other tutorials the more I
00:20 - learn about web Technologies like
00:21 - JavaScript the more I want to learn
00:22 - lower level languages like C++ a part of
00:25 - me wants to go back to college to study
00:27 - computer science I've done a little bit
00:29 - of research Arch and many seem to say
00:31 - that it's not necessary but I want to be
00:32 - marketable for a career in software
00:34 - development I have read that the
00:36 - industry is being flooded with jior
00:37 - developers that don't know enough to be
00:39 - productive so I suppose that is why I
00:41 - think I need to go back to school I had
00:43 - been applying to companies that fit my
00:45 - skill set and I haven't had received one
00:47 - response regarding an interview I'd
00:49 - really appreciate your advice on whether
00:51 - I should bite the bullet and go back to
00:52 - college or just keep getting better at
00:55 - JavaScript and web Technologies like
00:56 - react and angular this is actually a
00:59 - very common question I get and actually
01:01 - one that I also had when I was getting
01:04 - started with programming and I'll kind
01:06 - of start off by saying that there's
01:07 - really no Silver Bullet answer per se
01:10 - because it really just depends on you
01:12 - and honestly your circumstances your
01:14 - timing obviously and all that and what
01:16 - you can afford um but I can show you
01:19 - kind of my decision process for how I
01:21 - thought through this decision of whether
01:22 - I should go back to college if I want to
01:24 - become a
01:25 - programmer and I kind of outlined my
01:28 - decision process in my blog post on why
01:30 - I left the best job in the world so if
01:32 - you want a more detailed explanation of
01:34 - how I thought through this you can read
01:35 - that blog post um but let's just get
01:38 - started so I felt that for me I was
01:41 - already in a full-time job right and so
01:43 - for me I felt like if there's any way to
01:45 - learn to to for me to learn the skills
01:47 - of becoming a programmer without going
01:49 - back to college I was 100% for it um and
01:53 - the reason is because for one it's way
01:56 - cheaper right um like if I go back to
01:58 - college the tuition for college is what
02:00 - like anywhere between 10 20 40K a year
02:04 - and um I already had paid off I I
02:07 - already had a fouryear degree so I paid
02:10 - off already like $90,000 in student
02:12 - loans and I was like H I really don't
02:14 - want to take take out loans to go to
02:16 - college again and secondly it's it's I
02:20 - wanted a faster path um when I want
02:22 - something I really really want something
02:23 - and I want it right away and I didn't
02:25 - really have the patience to wait 2 3 4
02:28 - years to get a degree and then become a
02:30 - programmer um I wanted the fastest path
02:33 - and and the most efficient path to get
02:35 - there and so before I made the decision
02:38 - what I did was I reached out to a ton of
02:40 - people and did a lot of research on this
02:42 - right so first I met with a bunch of
02:44 - people who went the traditional path and
02:46 - they had a CS degree and I kind of
02:48 - talked to them and talked to them about
02:50 - how they got to um what their first job
02:52 - was like how they how they made that
02:53 - transition from school to getting their
02:55 - first job and so forth and then I met a
02:58 - bunch of people who were more the the
02:59 - non-traditional path who were either
03:01 - self-taught went to a boot camp or both
03:04 - and um and I kind of talked to them
03:06 - about their process for how they kind of
03:08 - broke in to become become a software
03:10 - engineer and at the end of this whole
03:12 - research process what I realized was yes
03:15 - there's a lot of people who take the to
03:17 - take the traditional path of getting a
03:19 - computer science degree but there's also
03:21 - hundreds or thousands of people who are
03:22 - totally totally killing it without a
03:25 - degree um top of my mind some examples
03:28 - of people who I really look up to who
03:30 - fit in this bucket are like Dan abob
03:32 - who's the creator of Redux or P Irish
03:35 - who now works at Google or my really
03:37 - good friend has kesi who was a poker
03:38 - player turn and software engineer just
03:40 - like countless examples that I saw in
03:42 - the industry and what's common amongst
03:45 - all these different people were that
03:47 - they were passionate they were
03:48 - determined and they were smart and at
03:50 - that and they just wanted this really
03:52 - badly and they figured out a way to do
03:53 - this without the degree so I was like
03:57 - okay if these people can do it I can do
03:58 - it too right and and um I think when
04:02 - you're kind of making this this decision
04:04 - it's important to just be honest with
04:05 - yourself and so when I look back and
04:07 - think through why I think I might have
04:10 - been successful without the degree is
04:12 - you know there there's a few different
04:13 - reasons I can think of one is that um I
04:16 - kind of already had a technical
04:17 - background so in college I was a systems
04:20 - engineer and I you know because of that
04:23 - I took a lot of pretty heavy high high
04:25 - level math and Engineering courses so I
04:28 - already like I was already kind of
04:30 - trained to think very analytically I was
04:32 - very good with math and very good with
04:33 - numbers but that's not to say that you
04:36 - need a technical degree to be a
04:37 - developer I think I know plenty of
04:39 - people who studied like philosophy or
04:41 - psychology in college and then later on
04:43 - in life realized they want to be
04:44 - developers but for me like I think that
04:46 - was one of the reasons why I was pretty
04:48 - successful in this
04:49 - transition and um second I was obviously
04:53 - extremely passionate about it and and I
04:55 - kind of conveyed this passion throughout
04:57 - various blog posts I've written and I
04:59 - just wanted this so badly and I think
05:01 - because I wanted it so badly I was
05:03 - incredibly determined I I worked really
05:05 - hard and I put I put a lot a lot of time
05:07 - and effort into making this reality
05:09 - happen um and you know along the way I
05:12 - did have to give up and sacrifice a lot
05:14 - like for example I didn't see my family
05:16 - for almost a year during the process I
05:18 - didn't see a lot of my friends for many
05:20 - many months um I was pretty much doing
05:22 - this day out day in and day out just
05:24 - learning how to code every single day
05:26 - getting a little bit better at it and um
05:29 - even you know even my boyfriend I didn't
05:31 - see for like you know I saw him once a
05:32 - week which is like really really hard
05:34 - obviously but um you kind of I was kind
05:37 - of willing to give up these things
05:39 - because I knew that I wanted this dream
05:41 - to come true so badly um and I think uh
05:46 - this might motivate some people so early
05:48 - on in my decision process I was talking
05:51 - to a really good Mentor and you know he
05:53 - was he's this kind of um highly academic
05:57 - person who has a CS degree and he has as
05:59 - a PhD in computer science um you know
06:02 - went to Stanford so very academic and I
06:05 - was kind of telling him about my
06:07 - decision to go become a software
06:09 - developer and I was kind of saying like
06:11 - hey like I don't know like one thing I'm
06:13 - worried about is how will I ever catch
06:15 - up with these people who've been
06:16 - programming since they were 12 years old
06:18 - they literally have like a decade of
06:20 - experience over me and maybe even a
06:22 - college degree and what he said he
06:25 - looked at me in the eye and he's like
06:26 - what I see in you is grit and passion um
06:29 - you're going to get there in no time
06:30 - just just go for it and when someone
06:33 - like that said that to me someone who's
06:35 - academic and has a degree and he just
06:36 - like he's like no you can do it without
06:38 - it like just go figure it out it's all
06:40 - about just doing and that that really
06:42 - was inspiring to me and I was like okay
06:44 - I can do this without the
06:46 - degree um and kind of to address his
06:49 - question of you know the industry is
06:51 - being flooded with Junior developers
06:53 - that don't know enough to be productive
06:55 - I totally um I've heard this too uh
06:58 - there's definitely a lot of people who
06:59 - are trying to get into the industry more
07:01 - than ever now and you know everyone kind
07:03 - of wants to be software developers it
07:05 - seems and sure there's probably a lot of
07:08 - developers out there who are simply not
07:09 - ready for full-time jobs and maybe
07:12 - they're getting hired but they're not
07:13 - being
07:14 - productive and but you know like as I
07:18 - said there's plenty of examples to show
07:20 - out there of people who are totally
07:21 - killing it in the industry without a
07:23 - degree um the main thing to understand
07:26 - though is that it's not easy it just
07:27 - takes a lot of hard work and there's
07:29 - really just no shortcuts not getting a
07:31 - degree doesn't mean that you take a
07:32 - shortcut it simply means that you work
07:34 - really really really extra extra hard to
07:37 - kind of make up for that lack of degree
07:39 - right you can't just expect to maybe
07:41 - take a course online or attend a three
07:43 - Monon Boot Camp or take like you know
07:46 - like an online boot camp like Udacity or
07:48 - something and then all of a sudden
07:49 - magically have a job um you can do all
07:52 - those things but that's just one part of
07:54 - the process and in addition to that you
07:56 - have to put hours and hours of practice
07:58 - and work and and really just make up for
08:01 - that time that you didn't spend in
08:02 - school getting a degree and so um to not
08:06 - be one of those people who are you know
08:07 - not being productive in the industry you
08:09 - just need to go above and beyond and
08:12 - every person I know who's successful in
08:14 - the industry um that doesn't have a
08:16 - degree they're successful because
08:18 - they've put these hours and dedicated
08:20 - their lives to making this reality come
08:22 - true um so again if you're willing to
08:24 - put the hard work then you honestly just
08:26 - won't be one of these developers who's
08:28 - not productive I
08:30 - have never met someone who's worked that
08:31 - hard and and and like didn't get better
08:34 - over time or wasn't the one of the
08:36 - better per best programmers I've ever
08:38 - met right um and even if it takes you
08:40 - longer to get there than than some
08:42 - others just don't compare yourself to
08:44 - other people it's just about putting in
08:46 - the hours putting in the time practicing
08:48 - coding um getting projects on your under
08:50 - your bell like you know it's frustrating
08:53 - like the first few months are very
08:54 - frustrating just keep trying keep trying
08:57 - and over time like you'll look you'll
08:58 - look up and you you're like oh my God I
09:00 - just know so much how did I get how did
09:02 - I even get here right and I think um if
09:06 - I had to go back and think one of the
09:08 - hardest part about not taking this path
09:11 - of not getting a degree is probably
09:13 - getting your first interviews and
09:14 - getting your first job because you don't
09:16 - have you don't have any experience you
09:18 - don't have anything to show that you you
09:20 - can code basically and so um what I
09:24 - would do like as I as I said in my last
09:26 - video if you don't have something like
09:28 - if you don't have a degree if you don't
09:29 - have experience don't focus on what you
09:31 - don't have show them everything else
09:33 - that you do got so this can be this can
09:35 - be like um this can be like side
09:37 - projects or this can be like internships
09:40 - or this can be like open source work
09:41 - that you've done or blog posts that
09:43 - you've written um just make up for that
09:46 - lack of degree in other ways right and
09:49 - um another thing I want to empathize is
09:51 - if you choose to not get a degree one
09:53 - thing that happened to me was I noticed
09:54 - that like I was starting to I I really
09:56 - wanted to fill in my gaps of some of the
09:58 - formal fundamental CS stuff like things
10:01 - like computer networking operating
10:02 - systems compilers algorithms and data
10:05 - structures design patterns like these
10:07 - are things I still wanted to learn
10:09 - because I think those are very very
10:10 - important too if you're going to be a
10:11 - serious software engineer these are all
10:13 - important things to learn and so what I
10:15 - did was I would learn these things on
10:17 - the side um on weekends or nights just
10:20 - like picking up a few books and um just
10:22 - like learning learning them on my own
10:24 - because I I really want to fill in those
10:26 - gaps that I didn't get um through formal
10:28 - training
10:30 - and I actually have met with a few
10:32 - companies now that are actually um
10:35 - specifically targeting people who don't
10:37 - have CS degrees but are software
10:38 - engineers and they're teaching more of
10:40 - these CS fundamentals like I met at a
10:42 - school called Bradfield School of
10:43 - computer science in San Francisco and
10:46 - they teach things like you know computer
10:47 - networking computer architecture
10:49 - databases compilers so you know like
10:51 - find something like this to fill in the
10:52 - gaps if you don't get that formal
10:54 - training instead if you take more of a
10:56 - um online course or boot camp approach
10:59 - and lastly um the the writer who wrote
11:03 - in said he wants to be a C++ developer
11:05 - without a CS degree um or he's asking if
11:08 - you should get a CS degree to be a C++
11:10 - developer obviously I can't answer that
11:12 - question because I've never tried that
11:14 - myself um uh I was a JavaScript
11:17 - developer and I also did some API work
11:19 - and backin work like I slowly moved down
11:21 - the stack um but my gut tells me it's
11:24 - definitely possible perhaps there's less
11:26 - C++ content and a lot more content to
11:29 - learn learn online with JavaScript Ruby
11:30 - or python but um I think anything in
11:34 - anything in the world is possible
11:35 - without a degree so if you if you're
11:37 - confident that you can do it um I don't
11:39 - think you I I'm never going to say that
11:41 - you must get a degree to do anything
11:43 - because I just don't believe that um but
11:46 - I do want to say that just because I
11:48 - didn't go back to get a CS degree it
11:50 - doesn't by any means mean that I think a
11:52 - CS degree is a waste of time in fact if
11:55 - I was in high school and I knew what I
11:56 - known now about computer science I'd
11:58 - probably do the computer science degree
12:00 - over the systems engineering degree that
12:03 - I did but you know like no regrets at
12:05 - the time when I was in you know 18 I
12:08 - really fell in love with systems
12:09 - engineering I loved my major um so I
12:12 - have no regrets it's just that I learned
12:13 - about computer science a little bit
12:14 - later in life so um I didn't have a
12:17 - chance to take CS in college but I think
12:18 - a CS degree if you're still in high
12:20 - school is obviously incredibly valuable
12:22 - and you should totally do it if you're
12:24 - in high school um but it's not game over
12:27 - if you haven't if if it's too late um
12:29 - there's always ways to to learn how to
12:31 - be a developer like I did and many
12:33 - others have done so um I want to close
12:36 - off by saying if you want to be a
12:37 - developer um you just need to start
12:39 - doing um you just need to start building
12:41 - because being a developer is not about
12:43 - sitting in a classroom or taking exams
12:46 - or taking tests or getting certificates
12:47 - or getting a degree it's really about
12:49 - just building software and if you can
12:51 - prove to people that you can build
12:52 - software the degree is just a tiny part
12:55 - of it and that will soon be Irrelevant
12:58 - in in the future
12:59 - and um and as I said there's just been
13:02 - thousands of people who've been
13:03 - successful without the degree and it
13:04 - really just depends on how much effort
13:06 - work and hard work you're willing to put
13:08 - into this so um yeah that's kind of my
13:12 - rationale for why I didn't take that
13:13 - path but um I hope you found this
13:16 - helpful and I'll see you in next week's
13:20 - video

Cleaned transcript:

hey it's prey again and I'm back with the ask prey series and this is week number two um this week's question is a very interesting one and one that I actually get pretty commonly and so let's go ahead and read it he says I've been teaching myself to Cod for almost a year now I initially started from free code camp and other tutorials the more I learn about web Technologies like JavaScript the more I want to learn lower level languages like C++ a part of me wants to go back to college to study computer science I've done a little bit of research Arch and many seem to say that it's not necessary but I want to be marketable for a career in software development I have read that the industry is being flooded with jior developers that don't know enough to be productive so I suppose that is why I think I need to go back to school I had been applying to companies that fit my skill set and I haven't had received one response regarding an interview I'd really appreciate your advice on whether I should bite the bullet and go back to college or just keep getting better at JavaScript and web Technologies like react and angular this is actually a very common question I get and actually one that I also had when I was getting started with programming and I'll kind of start off by saying that there's really no Silver Bullet answer per se because it really just depends on you and honestly your circumstances your timing obviously and all that and what you can afford um but I can show you kind of my decision process for how I thought through this decision of whether I should go back to college if I want to become a programmer and I kind of outlined my decision process in my blog post on why I left the best job in the world so if you want a more detailed explanation of how I thought through this you can read that blog post um but let's just get started so I felt that for me I was already in a fulltime job right and so for me I felt like if there's any way to learn to to for me to learn the skills of becoming a programmer without going back to college I was 100% for it um and the reason is because for one it's way cheaper right um like if I go back to college the tuition for college is what like anywhere between 10 20 40K a year and um I already had paid off I I already had a fouryear degree so I paid off already like $90,000 in student loans and I was like H I really don't want to take take out loans to go to college again and secondly it's it's I wanted a faster path um when I want something I really really want something and I want it right away and I didn't really have the patience to wait 2 3 4 years to get a degree and then become a programmer um I wanted the fastest path and and the most efficient path to get there and so before I made the decision what I did was I reached out to a ton of people and did a lot of research on this right so first I met with a bunch of people who went the traditional path and they had a CS degree and I kind of talked to them and talked to them about how they got to um what their first job was like how they how they made that transition from school to getting their first job and so forth and then I met a bunch of people who were more the the nontraditional path who were either selftaught went to a boot camp or both and um and I kind of talked to them about their process for how they kind of broke in to become become a software engineer and at the end of this whole research process what I realized was yes there's a lot of people who take the to take the traditional path of getting a computer science degree but there's also hundreds or thousands of people who are totally totally killing it without a degree um top of my mind some examples of people who I really look up to who fit in this bucket are like Dan abob who's the creator of Redux or P Irish who now works at Google or my really good friend has kesi who was a poker player turn and software engineer just like countless examples that I saw in the industry and what's common amongst all these different people were that they were passionate they were determined and they were smart and at that and they just wanted this really badly and they figured out a way to do this without the degree so I was like okay if these people can do it I can do it too right and and um I think when you're kind of making this this decision it's important to just be honest with yourself and so when I look back and think through why I think I might have been successful without the degree is you know there there's a few different reasons I can think of one is that um I kind of already had a technical background so in college I was a systems engineer and I you know because of that I took a lot of pretty heavy high high level math and Engineering courses so I already like I was already kind of trained to think very analytically I was very good with math and very good with numbers but that's not to say that you need a technical degree to be a developer I think I know plenty of people who studied like philosophy or psychology in college and then later on in life realized they want to be developers but for me like I think that was one of the reasons why I was pretty successful in this transition and um second I was obviously extremely passionate about it and and I kind of conveyed this passion throughout various blog posts I've written and I just wanted this so badly and I think because I wanted it so badly I was incredibly determined I I worked really hard and I put I put a lot a lot of time and effort into making this reality happen um and you know along the way I did have to give up and sacrifice a lot like for example I didn't see my family for almost a year during the process I didn't see a lot of my friends for many many months um I was pretty much doing this day out day in and day out just learning how to code every single day getting a little bit better at it and um even you know even my boyfriend I didn't see for like you know I saw him once a week which is like really really hard obviously but um you kind of I was kind of willing to give up these things because I knew that I wanted this dream to come true so badly um and I think uh this might motivate some people so early on in my decision process I was talking to a really good Mentor and you know he was he's this kind of um highly academic person who has a CS degree and he has as a PhD in computer science um you know went to Stanford so very academic and I was kind of telling him about my decision to go become a software developer and I was kind of saying like hey like I don't know like one thing I'm worried about is how will I ever catch up with these people who've been programming since they were 12 years old they literally have like a decade of experience over me and maybe even a college degree and what he said he looked at me in the eye and he's like what I see in you is grit and passion um you're going to get there in no time just just go for it and when someone like that said that to me someone who's academic and has a degree and he just like he's like no you can do it without it like just go figure it out it's all about just doing and that that really was inspiring to me and I was like okay I can do this without the degree um and kind of to address his question of you know the industry is being flooded with Junior developers that don't know enough to be productive I totally um I've heard this too uh there's definitely a lot of people who are trying to get into the industry more than ever now and you know everyone kind of wants to be software developers it seems and sure there's probably a lot of developers out there who are simply not ready for fulltime jobs and maybe they're getting hired but they're not being productive and but you know like as I said there's plenty of examples to show out there of people who are totally killing it in the industry without a degree um the main thing to understand though is that it's not easy it just takes a lot of hard work and there's really just no shortcuts not getting a degree doesn't mean that you take a shortcut it simply means that you work really really really extra extra hard to kind of make up for that lack of degree right you can't just expect to maybe take a course online or attend a three Monon Boot Camp or take like you know like an online boot camp like Udacity or something and then all of a sudden magically have a job um you can do all those things but that's just one part of the process and in addition to that you have to put hours and hours of practice and work and and really just make up for that time that you didn't spend in school getting a degree and so um to not be one of those people who are you know not being productive in the industry you just need to go above and beyond and every person I know who's successful in the industry um that doesn't have a degree they're successful because they've put these hours and dedicated their lives to making this reality come true um so again if you're willing to put the hard work then you honestly just won't be one of these developers who's not productive I have never met someone who's worked that hard and and and like didn't get better over time or wasn't the one of the better per best programmers I've ever met right um and even if it takes you longer to get there than than some others just don't compare yourself to other people it's just about putting in the hours putting in the time practicing coding um getting projects on your under your bell like you know it's frustrating like the first few months are very frustrating just keep trying keep trying and over time like you'll look you'll look up and you you're like oh my God I just know so much how did I get how did I even get here right and I think um if I had to go back and think one of the hardest part about not taking this path of not getting a degree is probably getting your first interviews and getting your first job because you don't have you don't have any experience you don't have anything to show that you you can code basically and so um what I would do like as I as I said in my last video if you don't have something like if you don't have a degree if you don't have experience don't focus on what you don't have show them everything else that you do got so this can be this can be like um this can be like side projects or this can be like internships or this can be like open source work that you've done or blog posts that you've written um just make up for that lack of degree in other ways right and um another thing I want to empathize is if you choose to not get a degree one thing that happened to me was I noticed that like I was starting to I I really wanted to fill in my gaps of some of the formal fundamental CS stuff like things like computer networking operating systems compilers algorithms and data structures design patterns like these are things I still wanted to learn because I think those are very very important too if you're going to be a serious software engineer these are all important things to learn and so what I did was I would learn these things on the side um on weekends or nights just like picking up a few books and um just like learning learning them on my own because I I really want to fill in those gaps that I didn't get um through formal training and I actually have met with a few companies now that are actually um specifically targeting people who don't have CS degrees but are software engineers and they're teaching more of these CS fundamentals like I met at a school called Bradfield School of computer science in San Francisco and they teach things like you know computer networking computer architecture databases compilers so you know like find something like this to fill in the gaps if you don't get that formal training instead if you take more of a um online course or boot camp approach and lastly um the the writer who wrote in said he wants to be a C++ developer without a CS degree um or he's asking if you should get a CS degree to be a C++ developer obviously I can't answer that question because I've never tried that myself um uh I was a JavaScript developer and I also did some API work and backin work like I slowly moved down the stack um but my gut tells me it's definitely possible perhaps there's less C++ content and a lot more content to learn learn online with JavaScript Ruby or python but um I think anything in anything in the world is possible without a degree so if you if you're confident that you can do it um I don't think you I I'm never going to say that you must get a degree to do anything because I just don't believe that um but I do want to say that just because I didn't go back to get a CS degree it doesn't by any means mean that I think a CS degree is a waste of time in fact if I was in high school and I knew what I known now about computer science I'd probably do the computer science degree over the systems engineering degree that I did but you know like no regrets at the time when I was in you know 18 I really fell in love with systems engineering I loved my major um so I have no regrets it's just that I learned about computer science a little bit later in life so um I didn't have a chance to take CS in college but I think a CS degree if you're still in high school is obviously incredibly valuable and you should totally do it if you're in high school um but it's not game over if you haven't if if it's too late um there's always ways to to learn how to be a developer like I did and many others have done so um I want to close off by saying if you want to be a developer um you just need to start doing um you just need to start building because being a developer is not about sitting in a classroom or taking exams or taking tests or getting certificates or getting a degree it's really about just building software and if you can prove to people that you can build software the degree is just a tiny part of it and that will soon be Irrelevant in in the future and um and as I said there's just been thousands of people who've been successful without the degree and it really just depends on how much effort work and hard work you're willing to put into this so um yeah that's kind of my rationale for why I didn't take that path but um I hope you found this helpful and I'll see you in next week's video
