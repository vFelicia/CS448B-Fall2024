With timestamps:

00:06 - hey everybody it's
00:08 - Jesse if you're new to the show uh I
00:12 - live stream my work it's just my normal
00:14 - work that I do every
00:15 - day the whole point is to
00:19 - show what a front-end developer does
00:22 - even the mistakes that I
00:24 - make hopefully I don't make too many
00:27 - mistakes but i' just like people to see
00:29 - that
00:31 - you don't have to be perfect to get a
00:33 - job as a developer especially people who
00:35 - are just starting
00:37 - out today we're going to do something
00:41 - that took me a while to figure out how
00:43 - to
00:43 - do it's really cool and
00:47 - useful and if you want to be able to do
00:51 - serice side rendering and make API
00:54 - calls then this this is one way to do it
00:57 - it's not the only way but this is the
00:59 - way that I found
01:00 - that's the easiest for me before we get
01:03 - started I'm gonna somebody asked in a
01:06 - live stream how long this is going to be
01:08 - about a half an hour if there's a lot of
01:10 - people in the chat asking questions
01:12 - sometimes I go over but I don't think
01:15 - I've ever gone longer than 45 minutes
01:18 - but the the code portion of it will be
01:20 - over in about a half an hour so 2:30 PM
01:24 - eastern
01:26 - time uh before we get started
01:30 - just want to give a shout out to my wife
01:32 - it's our 10th anniversary so sometimes
01:35 - she watches the show so in case she's
01:38 - watching happy
01:40 - anniversary uh I went over this
01:42 - yesterday the the schedule for next week
01:45 - so I'm not going to go over it in depth
01:47 - I just wanted to put it up here so you
01:48 - could see it I'm going to be at syntax
01:50 - Con in South Carolina next week the the
01:54 - end of next week so my schedule's going
01:56 - to be off and I have a lot of meetings
01:58 - early in the week so we're going to live
02:00 - stream Monday Tuesday at 11:30 a.m.
02:02 - eastern time I don't know if I'm going
02:04 - to be able to do it Wednesday I'll try
02:06 - and then I'm going to get in touch with
02:07 - the people who are organizing syntax con
02:10 - and see if they're cool with me doing
02:11 - some live streaming maybe some
02:13 - interviews from syntax conon so I'll let
02:16 - you know when I hear back from them and
02:19 - see if I can do
02:22 - that all right so
02:24 - let's oh thanks uh Julian said congrats
02:31 - what time is there now it's uh it's 2
02:35 - p.m where I'm
02:37 - at all right so let me let me flip over
02:41 - here and uh show
02:44 - you let me show you the page that we're
02:47 - going to
02:48 - be putting this
02:50 - on and I'm going to show
02:57 - you the data you can see the data on the
03:00 - screen right
03:04 - now okay so I'll pull this page over so
03:08 - this is a news page there's nothing on
03:10 - it right now it's going to be a Blog
03:11 - style
03:15 - page someone in the live chat asked NYC
03:18 - I'm actually I'm I'm in the same time
03:19 - zone as New York
03:22 - City but I'm in yeah I'm actually in
03:25 - Ohio I'm I'm on the very Eastern edge of
03:28 - Ohio so I'm Prett pretty close to
03:30 - Pittsburgh it's about a half hour drive
03:32 - for me to get to Pittsburgh so you you
03:35 - may be more familiar with where
03:37 - Pittsburgh is than where Stubenville is
03:39 - which is the city that I'm in right
03:45 - now somebody says hello from laia cool
03:49 - yeah so usually I I do have people give
03:51 - you know shout out where they're from uh
03:54 - I don't know the last week people just
03:56 - started doing that and I thought it was
03:57 - cool so if you want to put in the live
03:59 - stream where you're from and then at the
04:01 - end of the show I'll go through and uh
04:04 - just say where everybody was
04:09 - from so this is the news
04:12 - page like I said it's just going to be a
04:14 - Blog Page so what we want to do is we
04:16 - want to get data from a
04:20 - WordPress installation that's on a
04:22 - totally different
04:24 - server and we want to display that data
04:27 - here using the WordPress API I'm not
04:29 - going to go over how to set up anything
04:32 - in WordPress but the API is now uh it
04:35 - comes with WordPress course you don't
04:37 - need any extra plugins or anything it it
04:39 - should just work I don't
04:42 - think hey somebody's from Charleston
04:45 - South Carolina I'm gonna be in
04:46 - Charleston next week so uh Joey on the
04:49 - live chat uh I'll be in
04:53 - Charleston I'll be there Wednesday
04:55 - Thursday and Friday of next week for the
04:58 - uh St tax conon uh conference you should
05:01 - check it out if you can if you have
05:04 - time
05:07 - so like I said the word it's actually
05:09 - super easy I don't even think you have
05:11 - to switch on the API I think it's just
05:13 - on by default somebody can correct me if
05:16 - if I'm wrong but when I started working
05:19 - with it oh it's probably been a year
05:23 - maybe maybe a little more than a year
05:24 - probably a year and a half since I
05:25 - started working with the WordPress API
05:27 - you did have to install some plugins
05:30 - but uh now it's it's easier to work
05:33 - with so we want to grab that data but we
05:35 - don't just want to pull it
05:38 - in you know on the client side because
05:42 - if we pull in that
05:44 - data you know on the client side in the
05:49 - browser it'll be fine for for a regular
05:52 - person viewing it but if a search engine
05:55 - wants to check out your page they're
05:57 - going to see a blank page if if all your
05:59 - contents coming from an
06:01 - API search engines are well some of them
06:05 - I mean
06:07 - Google's uh Google search crawler can
06:09 - handle some JavaScript pretty well but
06:12 - it doesn't stick around long enough to
06:14 - get an API call back it doesn't matter
06:16 - how fast the call is I've tested it
06:18 - before with um W with just like you know
06:23 - test
06:25 - data that that should have loaded almost
06:27 - instantaneously and and you still
06:30 - it's not it doesn't work with search
06:32 - engines so the only way that I know of
06:36 - to make this site search engine
06:40 - friendly is to actually make the API
06:42 - call on the server okay so we're we're
06:45 - going to run node on the
06:47 - server right now it's just a local uh
06:52 - development environment so it's just on
06:53 - my local machine I'll do a live stream
06:56 - maybe maybe sometime next week if I can
06:58 - about actually setting up the
07:01 - server but on the server we're going to
07:04 - make the
07:05 - call and then we're going to render the
07:08 - HTML based on that data we get from the
07:11 - API on the server and what's going to
07:14 - get sent to the client on that first
07:16 - load is all the
07:25 - markup so to make this a little bit
07:27 - easier
07:29 - we are using
07:32 - nextjs so check out next I I have links
07:36 - to everything that I'm going to talk
07:38 - about in the description so if I
07:40 - mentioned something you're not familiar
07:42 - with check out the description for this
07:43 - video and and the links I do have this
07:47 - repo up now it's it's on GitHub the link
07:50 - is there uh the last couple shows I
07:53 - didn't have the repo up yet but now you
07:54 - can you can check everything out
07:59 - so we don't really need to see this
08:01 - until we finish the code now so I'm
08:02 - going to move this off just to show you
08:05 - what the data is going to look like let
08:08 - me zoom in a little bit here okay this
08:10 - is what WordPress sends back if I if I
08:14 - hit this
08:16 - URL it sends me back you know some Json
08:20 - all we're going to get today is I want
08:23 - this
08:24 - title and I want the content I don't
08:27 - really need anything else
08:29 - we'll see in in later videos I'll I'll
08:32 - start to get really detailed in in what
08:34 - I'm getting from here and actually get
08:37 - rid of all the stuff I don't need just
08:39 - to make it you know just a little bit
08:42 - faster uh but for now this is just what
08:45 - it looks like I have nothing special the
08:47 - only thing I added special in terms of
08:49 - parameters on the end I don't know if
08:51 - you can see that I did add uh posts per
08:54 - page 100 but I think I only have four
08:57 - demo posts set up so it doesn't even
08:59 - make sense um I'm going to move this off
09:02 - to the side we won't really need to see
09:05 - that we only need to bring that back if
09:07 - something goes
09:09 - wrong all right so now let's let's check
09:12 - out the
09:14 - code and we'll go to our page news news
09:19 - JS if you're not familiar with how next
09:22 - Works uh
09:24 - next basically is a way to let you get
09:27 - started with react very quickly
09:29 - it comes built in with a lot of cool
09:31 - stuff like serers side
09:34 - rendering and all your pages in your
09:37 - site all you have to do is make a file
09:41 - in this Pages folder and then the
09:43 - routing just works it handles all the
09:44 - routing for you so this is our news
09:48 - page all we have here we're uh we're
09:51 - importing some components just some
09:54 - basic things our footer uh our title we
09:57 - have this head tag is is custom for for
10:01 - next so we imported here it's next head
10:04 - so this is uh not exactly you won't have
10:09 - something like this in every react site
10:12 - that you
10:14 - do at least not not in the same way that
10:16 - NEX does
10:18 - it the uh the only different thing we
10:21 - had from from previous shows is we've
10:24 - now added this import isomorphic
10:28 - fetch so so
10:31 - uh um I'm going to look back the live
10:34 - stream I'm going to ignore the live
10:36 - stream for a little bit just to get
10:38 - through some of this section and I'll
10:39 - check back in later so if you're asking
10:42 - a question and I don't respond right
10:43 - away I will I will towards the
10:47 - end so if you're not familiar with
10:51 - fetch fetch is kind of the newest way to
10:56 - make to make calls you know apis
11:00 - basically it's what you would have done
11:03 - with Ajax if you're using jQuery or just
11:05 - a normal
11:07 - xhr uh now you can use fetch for and
11:12 - it's super simple you'll see the code in
11:14 - a second when I when I type it
11:16 - out the only thing is it's not supported
11:19 - everywhere yet I mean obviously older
11:21 - browsers pretty much every version of
11:24 - Internet
11:25 - Explorer I mean that's that's not really
11:28 - new St
11:31 - uh later on I'm
11:33 - sure you know most browsers will have
11:36 - support but for right now you have to
11:37 - use polyfills for Fetch and in
11:40 - particular if we want to use Fetch with
11:42 - node on the server side we can't just
11:44 - use fetch you normally uh because it's
11:49 - it's normally a browser thing and node
11:50 - is not running in the
11:53 - browser so we use this uh npm module
11:56 - isomorphic fetch it actually it comes
11:59 - packaged with next uh so that's why we
12:02 - can just use it like this I didn't have
12:04 - to install it separately if if you
12:07 - looked at the package Json file it's
12:09 - it's not in the list of things so it's
12:11 - nice that it comes with this there are
12:13 - some newer npm modules uh that do this
12:17 - as
12:18 - well uh fetch works for me I might check
12:22 - out some of the uh isomorph morphic
12:24 - fetch works for me I might check out
12:25 - some of the new ones later on if I think
12:28 - uh it'll provide Advantage if you know
12:30 - of any of you know newer versions of
12:33 - this uh that you like you know let me
12:36 - know let me know what's good about
12:40 - them so let's get started I'm just going
12:43 - to start typing out what we
12:46 - need
12:49 - so next comes
12:54 - with this get initial
12:57 - props uh
12:59 - function that's anything inside get
13:02 - initial props that's going to run on the
13:05 - server
13:07 - side so that call is going to run but
13:09 - then if you switch over to client side
13:11 - routing later
13:12 - on it'll also run that you know when
13:15 - you're doing so with next you can do
13:19 - server side first then switch to client
13:22 - side once things are loaded you can just
13:23 - stick with server side so that every
13:26 - every time you click a link it's a
13:28 - complete page refresh you know you can
13:30 - kind you do it however you want to do it
13:32 - you can do custom
13:34 - routing but right now we're going to
13:36 - start
13:39 - with and this is pretty basic this is
13:42 - pretty much how it is in the next
13:43 - documentation so you can check that out
13:45 - too if you want to learn more about
13:48 - it we need to get initial
13:53 - props okay and just you I think you'll
13:56 - be really amazed at how simple this is I
13:58 - know I was uh because I like I said I I
14:01 - tried for a long time to get server side
14:03 - routing to work with react and I just
14:06 - couldn't
14:07 - find I couldn't find a good tutorial
14:09 - that was at my level at the time you
14:12 - know sometimes you find a tutorial and
14:14 - it's just it's just too advanced you
14:17 - know uh but this was you know this was
14:20 - at my level when I needed
14:22 - it all right so I'm just going to make a
14:24 - couple of variables here if you're not
14:27 - familiar with this syntax you've using
14:29 - const instead of ver uh this is es6
14:33 - syntax or ex
14:36 - 2015 so this is
14:38 - just I mean a short explanation is when
14:41 - I make something a const it's never
14:43 - going to change I I can't I can't change
14:46 - this uh this variable later
14:49 - on uh there's some other things with
14:51 - with hoisting that happens when you use
14:53 - con or let uh but let kind of beond what
14:59 - we're talking about
15:00 - today all right so we we're going to use
15:03 - a URL and I'm going to just I'm going to
15:05 - copy and paste in that URL that I showed
15:07 - you just a minute ago where we're going
15:10 - to get that data so I like to you can
15:14 - type the URL straight into your your
15:16 - fetch uh function but I like to keep it
15:20 - a little bit more clean with some
15:21 - variables
15:29 - and I usually like to have my parameters
15:32 - separate it's not going to be really
15:34 - obvious right now why we need that but
15:37 - later
15:38 - on we're going to have like some really
15:41 - long strings of parameters they're going
15:43 - to add to this so it's better to
15:45 - separate them and easier to read uh so
15:47 - for now we can just
15:50 - add we just add posts because the demo
15:53 - uh WordPress site that I'm going to pull
15:55 - this data from it only has post right
15:57 - now uh later on we set up WordPress to
16:00 - have lots of custom post types and and
16:02 - we'll pull different
16:04 - things and now we're going to get to you
16:08 - know these first two variables this was
16:10 - just kind of the way I organize things
16:12 - now we're getting to you know the part
16:15 - the important part that you really
16:19 - need so this this uh syntax this part of
16:24 - it the next three lines are going to be
16:26 - pretty much straight
16:27 - from uh
16:30 - nextjs straight from their
16:33 - documentation wait let's
16:45 - see okay so this is it for fetch I mean
16:49 - think back if you've done especially if
16:52 - you've worked with xhr or
16:55 - Ajax think about how many lines it took
16:59 - you to accomplish an API
17:02 - call this is all you need
17:05 - now and if I didn't put them in you know
17:09 - these variables here you you could just
17:11 - put this whole URL right here it's it's
17:16 - so much
17:17 - simpler so if you haven't used fetch yet
17:20 - use it I may do a a tutorial video later
17:24 - on about how to set up your site to be
17:27 - able to use fetch in the browser and
17:30 - support older browsers uh and how to set
17:32 - up that
17:40 - polyfill I just glanced over at the live
17:42 - chat somebody asked a good question uh
17:45 - why is the head in the metadata inside
17:47 - that div yeah
17:50 - so this is weird to have a div here
17:53 - but I needed to have
17:57 - everything so basically I needed to have
17:59 - the body tag have these styles on
18:03 - it but I have no way at least no way
18:06 - that I know of with this setup to
18:09 - directly put something on the body tag
18:12 - so instead of looking it up and trying
18:13 - to figure out how to do it I thought I'd
18:15 - just try putting a div here around
18:17 - everything and see if it works and it
18:19 - did work
18:21 - so I would guess that there's a better
18:23 - way to do this but since I have such a
18:26 - short timeline for getting this site
18:29 - live I'm just going to stick with this
18:31 - for now because it works and then
18:33 - hopefully later on find a better way to
18:36 - do it but this looks a little weird but
18:39 - it it does actually
18:41 - work all right so let's finish this off
18:44 - right we're going to get Json
18:50 - back all right so we're going to save
18:52 - that in a variable called Data you can
18:54 - call that whatever you want
19:01 - okay and then all we're going to do now
19:02 - is just
19:05 - return we're going to turn that data
19:08 - okay now what this is going to do is
19:09 - this data is now going to be available
19:12 - as a
19:15 - prop so we can go down
19:18 - here and you yesterday we I explained
19:21 - how to use
19:22 - props so it's basically going to be the
19:25 - same the same concept here we're going
19:28 - to add this data is a prop prop but I'm
19:30 - going to
19:31 - do I'm going to show you how how I will
19:35 - be using
19:36 - this I'm usually not going to make an
19:38 - API call to just pull one piece of
19:41 - data I'm going to make an API call to
19:44 - pull a bunch of stuff in this case a
19:45 - bunch of posts and I want to Loop
19:48 - through all those
19:50 - posts and then render them you know a
19:52 - big list of
19:54 - them so I'm just going to type
19:56 - everything here for Simplicity normally
19:57 - you'd want to make another component and
20:00 - pass it to the component and we'll see
20:01 - that later on but for
20:04 - now we don't need all that uh we just
20:07 - want to make sure that this works make
20:08 - sure we get everything on the page that
20:10 - we need so we'll go
20:13 - this
20:15 - props and if I am going too fast I'll
20:18 - answer some questions in a little
20:23 - bit uh the same person asked the
20:25 - question about the div uh around
20:28 - everything thing says as long as we all
20:30 - agree that it's a hack definitely it is
20:32 - a
20:33 - hack but uh sometimes that's the way it
20:36 - is you just you need to get it done and
20:38 - you need to get it done very quickly so
20:40 - you have to resort to a
20:44 - hack so let's go this props and then
20:47 - data right so we named that data and we
20:50 - could have named it whatever we
20:52 - wanted but data is a nice kind of
20:54 - generic
20:56 - term and we we want to use
21:04 - map so we're going to use map a map
21:07 - function and we're going to we're going
21:10 - to call it a post since we're getting
21:12 - posts it makes sense you can call this
21:14 - whatever you want so that each time they
21:17 - Loop through a different piece a
21:20 - different piece of data that's going to
21:21 - be a different Post in our case we'll
21:23 - probably name this something different
21:25 - when we start using custom post types
21:27 - for each different post type we'll name
21:29 - it that that helps keep keep things
21:31 - pretty clear I'm also going to put this
21:34 - variable here just uh to keep track of
21:37 - what number we're on you'll see why I'm
21:38 - going to use that in a
21:41 - second and all we need
21:44 - now I need now is just to put in some of
21:47 - the HTML that's going to contain this
21:49 - data so we want to return and if you're
21:52 - not familiar at all with react all we
21:53 - just did here when we put this this
21:55 - curly bracket here is
21:59 - and now anything inside these curly
22:01 - brackets is Javascript we can type plain
22:03 - JavaScript in here so we've kind of
22:07 - started with
22:08 - JavaScript inside this this return now
22:12 - we're it's basically HTML with with a
22:16 - few differences but pretty much straight
22:19 - HTML and then now we've dropped back
22:22 - into JavaScript inside of here so if we
22:25 - want to Output HTML again we need to
22:28 - return it
22:29 - so we're just going to add another
22:31 - return and we're going to just start out
22:33 - we're just going to make a div to hold
22:35 - this data uh we're going to give it a
22:37 - class name you can't just put
22:42 - class uh you you'll get an error if you
22:44 - try to just put class you need to put
22:46 - class name there are a few other
22:49 - properties that you need to do some
22:52 - different things with uh Source set is
22:54 - one of them you have to type SRC and
22:57 - then capital
22:59 - C uh if you you're making a form or
23:01 - something and you use the four
23:04 - attribute uh I think you have to do HTML
23:07 - for with a capital f so uh I think they
23:11 - have all those listed on the react
23:12 - website just you know which which
23:15 - properties are supported uh but if
23:17 - you're getting weird
23:19 - errors it's for me at least a lot of my
23:22 - erors are resulting from forgetting to
23:24 - put class name instead of class
23:28 - so let's give this we'll just make this
23:30 - a row we're using materialized
23:37 - framework so a lot of these styles are
23:40 - built into that framework and then now
23:43 - here's where that that I variable is
23:45 - going to come
23:46 - in for react likes to have a key if
23:51 - you're going to have you know a bunch of
23:53 - divs that all have kind of the same
23:55 - thing in them that you're you're
23:57 - iterating over they like to have key so
23:59 - Oops I messed that up I don't want it to
24:01 - be a string I want it to be a
24:03 - variable uh so let's drop down so you
24:07 - see notice now we're in that return
24:09 - again so if I want to do JavaScript I do
24:11 - have to put these brackets again it can
24:13 - get confusing we're switching back and
24:15 - forth between you know what looks like
24:17 - HTML and
24:20 - JavaScript so we're just going to close
24:22 - that we're going to close that div
24:25 - inside that div we're just going to make
24:27 - an H1 you know just a normal H1
24:31 - tag uh to have our our title remember we
24:34 - just want to get the title of the post
24:35 - and the content so we're going to go
24:37 - post see so now that now that we're in
24:39 - here and we've
24:40 - named we've named this post we can just
24:44 - go straight into post and inside the
24:47 - post we want to get the
24:50 - title all right title and then if you
24:52 - remember it actually dropped down One
24:54 - More Level so the way WordPress uh
24:56 - formats the Json you can't just say
24:59 - title you have to go to
25:05 - rendered and that's that's it we that
25:08 - should output the title now for our
25:11 - content I'm going to do something a
25:12 - little bit different and I'll I'll
25:14 - explain
25:17 - why I'm going to give this a class of
25:20 - flow text materialize has this flow text
25:24 - class that resizes the text BAS based on
25:28 - your screen with kind of responsive font
25:31 - thing uh and that'll make the text a
25:33 - little bit more readable for us but I'm
25:36 - not going to put the data here I'm
25:40 - actually going
25:41 - to use this and this is not as scary as
25:44 - it
25:54 - sounds all right so I'm going to use
25:56 - dangerously set iner HTM ml so we're
25:59 - dropping back down into JavaScript here
26:02 - to do
26:05 - this okay so this is built into
26:19 - react I can't spell
26:22 - today okay so let me explain why we're
26:25 - doing this
26:29 - I will pull let's pull this back this uh
26:33 - this data back in I'm gonna flip switch
26:35 - over really
26:39 - quick let me make it a little bit bigger
26:42 - so since we're we're trying to pull this
26:44 - content rendered if you notice there is
26:47 - HTML in here all right there's a P
26:51 - tag in here and there there could be
26:54 - anything right this is WordPress so you
26:57 - somebody could type type in you know all
27:00 - a lot of different tags think if you had
27:02 - like uls you know unordered lists you
27:05 - know Lis you you know you could see
27:07 - there could be a lot of HTML if we just
27:10 - put
27:11 - this here like we did for the title
27:15 - we're going to see that markup and we
27:16 - don't want to see that
27:19 - markup uh I'm just checking out the live
27:23 - stream yeah I know this this seems
27:25 - pretty harsh but
27:28 - if you have control of where you're
27:31 - getting the data
27:33 - from and you know what's going to be put
27:35 - in there because you're the one that's
27:36 - going to be putting it in there or you
27:39 - know somebody in your on your team that
27:41 - you trust then there's really nothing
27:43 - wrong with doing
27:46 - this if you're just pulling in data from
27:49 - some other source that you have no
27:50 - control
27:51 - over yeah then maybe you might want you
27:54 - might want to think about not doing this
27:57 - uh you know so
27:58 - you might end up pulling in some some
28:01 - harmful code you don't want to do it but
28:02 - in this
28:03 - case you know this this WordPress site
28:07 - is on it's on my
28:09 - servers I'm actually the only person at
28:11 - this point that even has access to the
28:13 - admin
28:14 - panel so so it's okay it's it's not as
28:19 - it's it's not as crazy as it sounds it's
28:22 - it just sounds really harsh to put that
28:23 - in there all right
28:25 - so but you can see why we need to do
28:28 - that because we're going to have HTML
28:31 - tags inside this content so we need to
28:34 - render those tags as well all right so
28:37 - I'm going to save this and then I'm
28:39 - going to show you the
28:42 - page
28:43 - and we're going to see all right now I'm
28:47 - going to bring this in and as as it I
28:49 - said at the beginning I want you to see
28:51 - all my
28:54 - mistakes so you can see
28:58 - we have a mistake it's saying cannot
29:01 - read property map of undefined so
29:03 - somehow I've messed up in the API call
29:06 - so let's check this out I do want to
29:08 - just refresh this quickly to
29:12 - see here's a
29:15 - tip I've I've had this happen to me so
29:18 - many times I'm not sure
29:19 - why when I just hit save and it does the
29:22 - hot
29:24 - reload sometimes things don't work so
29:27 - before you start to
29:30 - despair do do a
29:34 - refresh sometimes it will actually work
29:37 - after the refresh and for whatever
29:39 - reason it just didn't work I'm sure
29:41 - there's some good
29:42 - reason why the the hot reload you know
29:45 - doesn't work for some
29:47 - things
29:49 - but I'm glad that worked and and we
29:51 - tried that before I went back in so if
29:53 - you can see this part part that was
29:55 - blank before now
29:59 - has our titles I'm using the bacon
30:03 - ipsum for this uh test data that has all
30:06 - our titles and then it
30:08 - has our
30:11 - content he and that's how you pull in
30:15 - data I want to let's look
30:17 - at let's view this
30:21 - Source oh this is going to be ugly I
30:23 - don't know if we'll be able to get to it
30:25 - but basically if you view the source you
30:27 - know you'll see all the HTML there here
30:29 - we go you know you see all this HTML
30:32 - here normally if you have a page that's
30:37 - making an API call and it's on the
30:39 - client side you know you won't see all
30:41 - the markup in in a view Source you'll
30:43 - see it if you inspect it in Dev tools
30:45 - but not of VI source so this just shows
30:48 - this is what search engines will see
30:50 - they're seeing all your data
30:59 - okay before I go to the live chat I just
31:02 - want to ask you guys you notice this is
31:04 - different from what it was a couple days
31:06 - ago it used to have an overlay this kind
31:10 - of white overlay over the entire image
31:12 - and then the title was centered
31:14 - vertically and
31:17 - horizontally I liked how that looked but
31:20 - after a meeting with the people I'm
31:23 - making the site for they wanted to see
31:27 - the full color of this image they didn't
31:30 - want this overlay on it at
31:34 - all I don't really want to put the title
31:37 - down here and have you know forced the
31:41 - rest of the content even farther down
31:42 - the page I mean because let's see you
31:44 - know normal screen is going to be more
31:47 - like like this for most
31:49 - people so you can see it's already kind
31:51 - of messed up the formatting I do have it
31:54 - zoomed in
31:55 - though let me take that back down down
31:58 - to normal size okay so my question to
32:02 - you
32:03 - is I don't like how this I don't like
32:06 - how this looks
32:07 - obviously do you know some way that we
32:11 - can still make this
32:13 - readable and also keep the image you
32:17 - know for the most part without an
32:20 - overlay so I'm thinking maybe of like
32:22 - having this fade a little bit more we'll
32:25 - see I've thought about just removing
32:27 - this section entirely and just having a
32:29 - title and then trying to work these
32:31 - images in some other way so let me know
32:34 - in in the
32:35 - comments uh or you know here in the live
32:38 - chat I would I'd really appreciate your
32:41 - opinion on that I've already spent a lot
32:44 - more time than I wanted to just kind of
32:46 - trying things out and nothing has
32:49 - nothing has has looked right to
32:53 - me all right so now if uh if you don't
32:57 - want to stick around for me to go
32:58 - through the questions in the live chat
33:00 - Now's the Time to Leave it's already
33:02 - been a half an hour otherwise if you
33:04 - have a little bit more time I'm going to
33:05 - go through the live chat uh I'm going to
33:08 - read out where everybody's from and I'm
33:11 - going to answer questions if you have
33:13 - any questions that you didn't get in the
33:14 - live chat you can put them in the
33:17 - comments if you don't want to put your
33:19 - question in the comments for everybody
33:20 - to read just uh direct message me on
33:24 - Twitter uh my link to my Twitter account
33:27 - is in the descript
33:30 - description all right so I'm scrolling
33:32 - up to the top now of the live
33:35 - chat and let's see we
33:38 - have someone from
33:41 - Guatemala and people saying
33:43 - congratulations thanks for saying
33:44 - congratulations if you missed at the
33:46 - beginning it's I said it's my 10-year uh
33:48 - wedding anniversary today so uh thanks
33:52 - for the the congratulations
33:56 - guys so from
33:59 - laia Cherry Valley Illinois Columbia
34:03 - Charleston London England
34:05 - Baghdad Atlanta Tokyo Canada
34:11 - Brazil uh it's B Horizon
34:16 - Brazil Cordova Argentina
34:20 - Albania okay we have a question what's
34:23 - the difference between isomorphic Fetch
34:26 - and a normal request to an API so uh
34:30 - Marius asked asked this question so a
34:33 - normal request what normally I I don't
34:36 - know about you but I would say all the
34:39 - API requests that I had done up until
34:41 - the point when I started using react in
34:43 - this way was I just made it on the
34:45 - client side so usually I would use Ajax
34:49 - because most of the sites I worked on
34:51 - were already loading jQuery for some
34:53 - other reason so I would just use
34:55 - Ajax and I would make the request like
34:57 - that I did start to switch over and use
35:00 - fetch but all those were on the client
35:04 - side
35:06 - so everything would would load you know
35:09 - the JavaScript would load on the page
35:11 - and then the call would be made but
35:14 - search engines couldn't see the data
35:16 - from that call when we're using
35:17 - isomorphic fetch isomorphic is a term
35:19 - that's used at least in uh in web
35:23 - development to mean that uh it's like
35:27 - something that runs on the client and
35:28 - the server both uh sometimes they call
35:31 - it Universal uh so you'll hear those
35:34 - kind of used
35:36 - interchangeably but to say it's an is
35:39 - isomorphic fetch just means that it is
35:41 - it is fetch so it's it's basically a
35:45 - newer version of an Ajax call that can
35:49 - run on the server in this case it's
35:52 - running uh we're running node on the
35:54 - server so it's a version of fetch
35:58 - that can run on
36:01 - node and that's necessary as I mentioned
36:04 - earlier to be able to render all the
36:07 - content that you want the uh the search
36:10 - engines to see on the server and then
36:13 - send it all all out on that first load
36:17 - so hopefully that that answered your
36:18 - question uh if not you know uh comment
36:22 - and uh I can answer it in more depth
36:25 - later on all right we got somebody from
36:27 - South Africa said they're enjoying the
36:29 - stream thanks I'm glad you're enjoying
36:31 - it
36:35 - Kazakhstan PESA Brazil sorry if I'm
36:39 - mispronouncing the places that you're
36:40 - from I'm trying my best
36:44 - India all right somebody from India says
36:48 - uh I'll I'll try to pronounce AB abishek
36:51 - from
36:52 - India is saying that these videos keep
36:56 - me a hell of lot motivated and helps
36:59 - keep the procrastination on hold awesome
37:01 - I'm really glad to hear that uh I'm
37:03 - pretty much I'll only keep doing these
37:06 - if I think you guys are getting some
37:08 - benefit and sorry guys guys and girls I
37:12 - I don't mean any offense by using that
37:15 - uh so
37:18 - um yeah so let me know if you guys think
37:21 - if you people think that that it's uh
37:24 - useful to you you know please let me
37:26 - know and and that's motivation for me to
37:28 - keep doing it and try to do a better job
37:30 - if you have any advice for me on how to
37:32 - make these better please let me
37:34 - know okay somebody says so don't use
37:37 - react router when during stra side
37:39 - rendering yeah I haven't worked with
37:41 - react router enough to even be able to
37:43 - address
37:44 - that because next handles a lot of the
37:47 - routing we're going to do a little bit
37:48 - of custom routing and we'll get into
37:50 - that probably next
37:52 - week but I I don't know enough about it
37:55 - so I can't really comment on that
37:58 - what place is your desktop background
38:00 - image from what is my desktop background
38:02 - image right now
38:06 - um I don't know this maybe this is the
38:09 - default that comes with Mac so I'm using
38:12 - uh Mac uh OS 10 Sierra as the operating
38:15 - system so I guess that's the default I
38:19 - don't know let me know if anybody else
38:20 - is using that I think that's the default
38:23 - uh and I'm assuming it's that they're
38:25 - talking about the Sierra Nevada mountain
38:27 - range is here in the
38:29 - US I I don't really know usually the
38:32 - last couple operating systems for Mac
38:34 - have been named after mountains and then
38:36 - the default image is that
38:39 - mountain okay we had some stuff I
38:42 - answered some of
38:45 - this okay somebody said we can move the
38:47 - head into header. JS
38:50 - component that's what I thought so I
38:53 - actually tried to move the stuff in the
38:55 - header let me bring that over so we know
38:57 - know what we're talking about
38:59 - so uh so we had somebody in the live
39:02 - chat
39:03 - mention that we can move all this this
39:05 - head stuff into a
39:11 - component I tried so here's what I tried
39:13 - to do I moved all this to a component
39:15 - and then I just loaded that component
39:18 - here and it it didn't
39:20 - work basically the the page actually did
39:23 - load I didn't get you know the the pink
39:25 - error screen but all this stuff that I
39:29 - was trying to bring in the stylesheets
39:33 - and the fonts none of them loaded
39:36 - neither the the title didn't load none
39:38 - of this loaded so I don't know what the
39:41 - problem is I I would definitely like to
39:43 - just put this all on a
39:46 - component the one reason why I don't
39:50 - mind it being here is that I can
39:52 - customize this although I certainly
39:55 - could have that as a prop in the
39:56 - component and that in
39:58 - so uh one thing I could try that I
40:02 - didn't think about until now is you know
40:04 - what if I just copied all of this
40:06 - including this this head component into
40:09 - a component and then I imported this
40:13 - next head into that
40:16 - component I don't know that might work
40:18 - I'm GNA have to try that so thanks for
40:20 - uh for mentioning that because it kind
40:23 - of made me rethink what I did and
40:25 - realize maybe there is a way to make it
40:28 - work so I'll maybe I'll try that uh
40:31 - after the live stream
40:34 - today
40:39 - okay uh mobin 92 says I see that the
40:42 - site includes the stylesheets fonts and
40:45 - scripts do we have to do that for every
40:47 - page again and again isn't there some
40:49 - kind of templating mechanism oh yeah I
40:51 - mean that's
40:53 - basically uh kind of like the last
40:56 - comment
40:58 - yeah I think there should be a better
41:00 - way to do
41:01 - this I was reading through the nextjs
41:05 - documentation to see if there was
41:07 - something like that I think I remember
41:09 - reading at some point about some layout
41:12 - component and I'm assuming that it can
41:15 - do something like that I just need to
41:18 - read more into it uh from the last time
41:20 - I used nextjs on a project they've had a
41:24 - lot of updates and a lot of new features
41:26 - so I need to go back in and kind of
41:29 - relearn it you know what what are the
41:31 - best ways to use it now so at the time
41:34 - when I first used it I didn't find a
41:37 - better way to do this for right now
41:40 - since I don't have that many pages it's
41:42 - faster for me to just do this but if I
41:44 - had a larger site I would definitely try
41:46 - to figure out some way to just put this
41:49 - in a component have it you know
41:51 - templating like you said uh but for now
41:56 - you know once again because because of
41:57 - the very short time frame that the site
41:59 - needs to launch I'm probably not going
42:01 - to have time to find the answer to this
42:03 - and to really mess with it I I kind of I
42:05 - wish I had more time to really do this
42:08 - you know the best way that I
42:12 - can okay side effect and
42:17 - react okay we
42:19 - have from side effect and
42:23 - react app I use Redux Saga or Redux
42:26 - stunk I've heard about
42:28 - Redux I haven't worked with Redux yet
42:31 - but I've heard a lot of good things
42:32 - about it watched some videos on it so uh
42:36 - yeah definitely I from the little I know
42:38 - about it I can recommend it as as being
42:40 - something uh really useful to use with
42:44 - react okay almost to the bottom of the
42:47 - live
42:51 - chat um I'm seeing the comments now when
42:54 - I use that dangerously set enter HTML
42:58 - someone says they uh they hate WordPress
43:00 - but need
43:01 - WordPress I have I have a somewhat
43:04 - similar feeling about WordPress I like
43:08 - how easy it is for people who don't know
43:10 - code to edit things in
43:13 - WordPress and that's why I use it in
43:16 - this case that that is kind of why I'm
43:17 - using it because we're going to have
43:20 - some uh some graduate students who are
43:23 - going to who don't know anything about
43:24 - code are going to need to input some
43:25 - data
43:28 - but I don't really like working with the
43:29 - PHP and the uh the templating system
43:33 - within WordPress and I'm not I'm not
43:36 - really interested in leveling up my PHP
43:38 - skills at this point I'd rather work on
43:41 - my JavaScript
43:43 - skills
43:46 - so that's why I'm using Wordpress like
43:49 - this if there were some kind of less
43:52 - heavy content management system that I
43:54 - could pull data from that was as stable
43:58 - and as userfriendly as WordPress I would
44:00 - definitely try that
44:06 - out as I scroll down now it's uh seems
44:09 - like the same reason they said they use
44:11 - it for clients and that's actually that
44:13 - that's it uh it's it's really easy for
44:15 - clients to to
44:17 - manage someone ask Anthony Lopez ask why
44:19 - is coding so
44:22 - fun uh I think coding is fun
44:27 - CU you're building something you're
44:28 - building something that usually helps
44:31 - people in some way you can build things
44:34 - that are are
44:36 - beautiful when you build you get
44:38 - immediate feedback which is really
44:40 - awesome and if you mess it up it usually
44:41 - it doesn't cost you anything you
44:44 - just you know you just undo whatever you
44:46 - did you go back to the last commit so
44:50 - that's really cool other you know I I
44:52 - enjoy building
44:53 - things in in the real world too but but
44:58 - you know if you're if you mess something
44:59 - up when you're building things in the
45:00 - real world world then you usually can't
45:02 - reuse it and you have to go buy more
45:04 - materials I I think it's awesome that
45:07 - you can just try things out when you're
45:09 - building a website or an app and not
45:12 - have to worry about messing it up you
45:14 - know you just make another Branch for
45:17 - your code you know with Git try out
45:19 - whatever crazy thing you want to do if
45:21 - it works awesome if it doesn't work well
45:23 - you just go back to you know your
45:25 - original branch and you know leave it
45:27 - for later on try to figure it out later
45:29 - I think you know that's that's cool for
45:31 - me and I really like learning uh
45:33 - learning all the the latest
45:36 - stuff so I don't know maybe it's not
45:38 - like that for everybody but at least for
45:40 - me that's you know that's what I can
45:42 - think of in just in a minute or two here
45:46 - of why I like coding so
45:49 - much somebody asked if it's a pretty
45:51 - common practice so Joey ask is it pretty
45:53 - common practice to just use WordPress
45:55 - for its backend API and build your own
45:57 - front end I don't think it's common
46:00 - yet so I first heard about
46:04 - this probably maybe two years ago or
46:07 - maybe a year and a half ago
46:10 - and it wasn't really common they were
46:14 - saying that the WordPress API at that
46:16 - point wasn't stable and it could change
46:19 - so you really shouldn't use it but I
46:21 - found some sites that were actually
46:22 - using it you know in production so I
46:25 - decided to give it a shot and I built a
46:27 - few sites with it that are they're
46:29 - actually live and and they're working
46:31 - well and they have been working you know
46:33 - with with no no
46:36 - downtime for
46:38 - months I've had no problem with it so
46:42 - yeah it's not common yet but I
46:44 - definitely think it it could end up
46:46 - being common I'd actually I have a
46:48 - project in mind to make a very easy way
46:51 - for people who use WordPress to use
46:55 - react as kind of the front end without
46:58 - them having to know that much about
47:00 - react so it would be limited in that it
47:02 - would you basically be limited to your
47:04 - your default pages and posts in
47:06 - WordPress but they would really just
47:08 - need to plug in
47:10 - their their URL and then the react part
47:14 - of it would just kind of take over and
47:17 - and put out the data so it would be it
47:20 - would be easier for people they would
47:22 - have to still know a little bit about
47:24 - you a little bit of JavaScript but it
47:27 - would be much easier than trying to do
47:28 - it all yourself so maybe I'll get i'll
47:31 - get to the point where I have some time
47:32 - to to make that and uh maybe maybe you
47:36 - can help me out with that I I'll
47:37 - certainly H have that the Open Source on
47:39 - GitHub if I do
47:47 - it okay almost to the
47:52 - bottom I was almost to the bottom maybe
47:55 - I think I had some more some more people
47:57 - typing in and now the bottom is getting
48:00 - farther away of this of this live
48:03 - chat all right so okay now thanks for
48:08 - all this advice on the uh the text the
48:10 - title text maybe fade the size I'm yeah
48:13 - I'm going to try that so Anthony
48:15 - suggested maybe fade the sides maybe
48:17 - another black bar under the image with
48:19 - the white text in
48:20 - it make it
48:24 - black put a background on only the
48:27 - text yeah yeah I see what you guys are
48:30 - saying I'll try I'll definitely try
48:32 - these out change the color drop shadow
48:35 - yeah I've done that before I really hate
48:37 - to add a drop shadow since I'm not using
48:38 - it anywhere else but um I I'll have to
48:42 - try these out and see what they look
48:44 - like I think that that oval fade maybe
48:47 - maybe that would work
48:50 - too okay so somebody asks MJS versus
48:54 - nextjs
48:57 - I don't have enough experience with M to
49:00 - comment on that I like
49:03 - nextjs they seem to add new features
49:05 - really quickly and be really responsive
49:08 - uh on GitHub when you raise an
49:10 - issue so I I don't have a problem with
49:13 - it there are some things about next
49:15 - that I wish it could do that it can't
49:18 - right now or it's possible I I just
49:21 - don't know how to do it and I'll
49:23 - probably get to some of those things
49:24 - maybe next week in the videos or the
49:26 - week after after uh but I don't know I
49:29 - don't really know very much at all about
49:30 - M so guess you fill me in in the
49:32 - comments and let me know what you think
49:36 - so we have somebody from Romania from
49:38 - Poland Orlando Philippines India New
49:43 - Jersey uh Saudi Arabia India
49:49 - Russia okay we have a question here from
49:54 - Josh so Josh began coding about one week
49:57 - ago any advice for feeling overwhelmed
49:59 - at the beginning and not giving up oh
50:01 - man yeah
50:04 - uh that feeling of being overwhelmed
50:07 - will you'll have that even after you're
50:11 - not a beginner anymore but it gets
50:13 - better you don't have it as often and
50:16 - you kind of know how to push through
50:19 - it don't feel like you have to learn
50:21 - everything all at
50:23 - once if you watch a YouTube video or or
50:26 - you know read a a blog post on some
50:29 - concept and you're just totally lost
50:31 - don't worry about it watch it again
50:33 - watch it two or three times practice a
50:36 - little bit and then go come back to it
50:38 - it'll be a great feeling for you when
50:40 - you come back to a video that made no
50:41 - sense to you you know a month or two ago
50:44 - and now you totally understand it so I
50:47 - would say just keep trying don't don't
50:49 - try to do things that are Way Beyond
50:51 - your level you know take it kind of
50:54 - slower uh don't be
50:57 - I'm I'm always going back and doing
50:59 - tutorials that are like beginner
51:02 - tutorials and I usually fly through a
51:04 - lot of the stuff but I always pick up
51:06 - something useful that I didn't know so
51:09 - I'd say you know don't don't have too
51:11 - much pride to uh you know to go back to
51:15 - the beginning and kind of try to relearn
51:18 - some things you'll always pick up
51:19 - something new I mean don't spend all
51:20 - your time in the beginner tutorials but
51:23 - uh I I'm I'm with you and feeling over
51:26 - overwhelmed at times usually at some
51:30 - point in a project I I hit a point where
51:32 - I just
51:33 - think like how did I get myself to this
51:36 - point how am I ever going to get this
51:37 - done on time and have it
51:40 - work and you can't give up you know you
51:43 - still got to you you got to ship the
51:45 - site you know it has to go live you know
51:47 - you're being paid to do that so you just
51:50 - work through it just break it up into
51:52 - small
51:54 - tasks use resource online you stack
51:58 - Overflow uh ask questions you know on
52:01 - YouTube videos and if you know somebody
52:04 - else who codes have them take a look at
52:05 - your code but I mean I guess the the
52:09 - best advice I could give you is
52:11 - just don't give up and realize that the
52:14 - overwhelm feeling is is
52:16 - normal and you'll get better and that
52:18 - feeling will slowly start to go away and
52:20 - not be as bad so hopefully that
52:23 - helps all right we have somebody from
52:25 - Salvador Brazil
52:27 - also you know if anybody else has any uh
52:30 - advice for someone just starting out
52:31 - feeling overwhelmed please post that in
52:33 - the
52:34 - comments somebody from
52:39 - Seattle
52:42 - turkey okay so we have some people some
52:45 - people commenting back uh saying take
52:47 - Little
52:48 - Steps somebody else knows the
52:51 - feeling uh oh someone said is it
52:53 - inspired me watching you well thanks I I
52:56 - appre appreciate that I'm glad it it's
52:58 - providing some value to you uh please
53:01 - save this stream yeah all the streams
53:03 - somebody just said please save the
53:05 - stream all the streams pretty much like
53:08 - five minutes after the stream is over
53:10 - they go um they're available on the free
53:13 - code Camp Channel I do have some other
53:15 - videos on my own channel and that's
53:17 - Linked In the description I'm going to
53:18 - do some pre-recorded tutorials and put
53:20 - that on that channel as well but I'm
53:22 - probably not going to have time until
53:23 - after this launch the site launches
53:25 - later this month and then and uh so if
53:27 - you have any requests for tutorials
53:29 - that'll be kind of shorter more to the
53:31 - point tutorials uh let me know if if you
53:34 - want to learn about anything and and if
53:36 - I know about it I'll make a
53:39 - video well what can you do if you have
53:41 - many pages so somebody uh uh mobin 92
53:45 - asked about what can you do if you have
53:46 - many pages and I think this is referring
53:48 - back to that you know having all the uh
53:52 - the whole content of the head tag in
53:55 - every page I I don't know the answer to
53:57 - that right
53:59 - now I'm I'm assuming there is an answer
54:02 - and I just don't know it yet and I
54:04 - haven't taken the time to try to find it
54:07 - yet same style that menu okay so we have
54:12 - another recommendation for the nav menu
54:15 - uh I'll just I'll skip over those for
54:17 - now and I'll I'll read them because
54:18 - that's more of advice directly to me and
54:20 - I'll try out these different
54:24 - things all right we have another
54:26 - question
54:28 - mads Jensen is
54:30 - asking studying web development at my
54:32 - school but when I showed them the
54:34 - website free code Camp they said that
54:36 - they coded wrong so I'm so confused they
54:38 - say you use too much too much div HMO
54:43 - 5 uh yeah I don't I don't know what to
54:47 - say I'm not
54:48 - sure if you're using something like
54:52 - bootstrap or like I'm using materialized
54:55 - sometimes
54:56 - that's the way you have to do it you use
54:59 - you use a lot of divs I'm sure there's
55:01 - different philosophies on how you should
55:03 - structure your
55:05 - HTML I don't know that I'm in a position
55:07 - to comment on which one is the best or
55:09 - which one's right or
55:10 - wrong I mean to me at the end of the day
55:15 - you got to make a site that's
55:16 - userfriendly to your users if it's also
55:19 - coded beautifully so that somebody can
55:20 - look at your code and it's awesome then
55:22 - that's great too but uh especially if
55:25 - you're just starting out which people
55:26 - who are using free code Camp are usually
55:28 - just starting
55:30 - out I don't know it maybe I don't know
55:33 - if this is good advice or not but I
55:35 - would say don't worry as much about your
55:37 - style of coating don't don't fret about
55:39 - indentation and how many divs you're
55:41 - using try to learn the basics try to
55:43 - make some cool stuff and get yourself
55:45 - excited about coding you know later on
55:48 - when you get a lot better you know then
55:50 - you can worry about those tiny details
55:53 - like that but uh I just uh to me I think
55:56 - sometimes people spend way too much time
55:58 - on those tiny little details that most
56:01 - people will never even notice in your
56:03 - code because the majority of people
56:05 - looking at your site are not developers
56:08 - so you guys can weigh in in the comments
56:10 - on that let me know if you
56:13 - disagree but I would say you know don't
56:16 - don't worry about that free code Camp's
56:17 - going to give you a lot of good advice
56:19 - and things
56:20 - and uh I'm I'm not sure why they're why
56:24 - they're saying that it's it's coded
56:34 - wrong
56:42 - okay I think we're at the end
56:45 - now is there any other of another
56:48 - question is there any other CMS solution
56:50 - you use in your projects besides
56:53 - WordPress I have used in the past I've
56:56 - used jumla and I've used
56:59 - Drupal I found uh both of them to be
57:03 - less userfriendly both for developers
57:05 - and for the clients so I don't use those
57:08 - unless I really have to like if I'm if I
57:11 - need to work on an existing site and I
57:14 - can't and it doesn't make sense to
57:16 - switch it
57:18 - over uh I have tried out some other like
57:21 - kind of newer really small content
57:23 - Management Systems there are some that
57:25 - actually are built with node that I'm
57:27 - really excited about but I haven't found
57:30 - one
57:31 - that's that's at that level that
57:33 - WordPress is of of just being refined
57:36 - and user friendly and stable you know
57:38 - nothing has as big of a user base to be
57:41 - able to ask questions to people
57:44 - so I'd really love to find something
57:47 - especially it'd be great if I could find
57:49 - a Content management system that was
57:51 - built with
57:52 - node I think that would be ideal because
57:56 - if you're already going to use node
57:57 - you're using JavaScript if you're going
57:59 - to work with react then you can just use
58:02 - JavaScript to work with your content
58:04 - management system as well uh it could be
58:07 - a lot more lightweight if you don't
58:08 - intend to actually have templating
58:10 - directly with that if you're just going
58:11 - to use it for the API so I'm I'm still
58:14 - kind of waiting for something to emerge
58:16 - as the front runner in that area of I
58:18 - guess what you would call a headless
58:20 - content management system where you just
58:22 - got things through the API and is built
58:25 - with JavaScript
58:26 - that would be awesome if anybody knows
58:28 - about something like that uh put in the
58:30 - comments please and uh I'll try it out
58:32 - when I get a
58:34 - chance okay somebody's asking about es6
58:38 - training um there's a lot of
58:41 - res I don't know off the top of my head
58:44 - uh where to send you for you know a good
58:46 - resource for es6 training I know there's
58:48 - a lot of good videos maybe
58:52 - um you know what if if you're still
58:55 - watching uh
58:57 - sorv kumars asked for es6 training if
59:00 - you're still watching make comment uh in
59:04 - this video and then I'll see that later
59:05 - on and maybe I can send you some links
59:08 - to some of the training stuff that I've
59:09 - used to learn
59:12 - es6 okay someone says yes that helped
59:14 - thank you so much oh you're welcome I'm
59:16 - glad it
59:17 - helped okay somebody said making your
59:19 - code readable is still important yes
59:21 - definitely uh it is definitely important
59:23 - to make your code readable
59:26 - um I would just and this is entirely my
59:29 - opinion but uh and this is this is
59:33 - coming from someone who primarily Works
59:35 - solo on projects I don't work with other
59:38 - people a lot right now on my projects so
59:41 - I rarely need to have other people look
59:42 - at my code so I'm in a different
59:45 - position than a lot of people who are
59:46 - working on a team where it's more
59:48 - important so you know take that into
59:51 - consideration with my advice but I would
59:54 - say the fol Focus for me is always on
59:58 - what is the user going to see and making
60:01 - that the best in second place in terms
60:04 - of priorities is making my code readable
60:07 - I'm not saying I ignore that part I do
60:09 - try to make it readable but if it's
60:11 - coming down to the wire and I only have
60:13 - I don't have time to do everything I'll
60:17 - always choose to make you know the user
60:19 - experience a little bit better at the
60:21 - expense of readability of the code and
60:24 - if I have time later I'll go back in and
60:26 - try to clean that up uh but that that's
60:29 - just
60:32 - me okay instead of Wordpress you can use
60:35 - ponzu written and go okay I haven't
60:38 - heard about ponzu so maybe I'll check
60:39 - that out thank
60:42 - you somebody asked if they should learn
60:44 - jQuery as soon as possible or learn
60:47 - first learn JS well I think it depends
60:50 - on what you want to do if you want to go
60:52 - and learn react don't worry about jQuery
60:56 - learn js's well if you need to make
60:59 - money right now and let's say you're
61:01 - doing some freelance work there are a
61:02 - lot of sites that use jQuery and if you
61:05 - want to work on those sites to update
61:07 - them you know then you'll need to know
61:10 - some
61:11 - jQuery so it really depends on where
61:13 - you're at if you know if you get hired
61:15 - somewhere and their site uses jQuery
61:17 - obviously you need to learn that so I
61:19 - don't really know where you're at but um
61:22 - if if you don't need to use jQuery right
61:25 - now then learn learn the basics of
61:27 - JavaScript okay but you never know I
61:29 - mean sometimes I I've done a lot of work
61:31 - that I didn't really want to do and um
61:35 - but you got to do it you got to pay the
61:37 - bills you got to feed your family so um
61:40 - you learn what you have to learn to do
61:42 - that so I'm I'm not going to judge you
61:44 - for uh for going with jQuery if you need
61:50 - to all right this is a good comment here
61:53 - and and we are actually TW Wards the end
61:57 - uh so John heiner says you'll pretty
61:59 - much find Dev saying everything and its
62:01 - opposite one of the misconceptions I
62:02 - think newbies have is that there is one
62:05 - way to do things but there's an ongoing
62:07 - debate about most things I I love that
62:10 - comment so John if you're still
62:11 - listening thank you that's that's a
62:13 - wonderful comment it's entirely right
62:15 - when I was really new I was always
62:17 - trying to find like what is the best way
62:19 - and I'd worry like should I be learning
62:21 - this is this the best thing is this the
62:23 - best way but that's not how it is
62:25 - there's there's so many ways of getting
62:27 - the same thing done it's more about your
62:30 - style and what you like to do or what
62:33 - your client needs at the time I'm a big
62:37 - advocate of using the tools the best
62:39 - tools that you know of for that
62:41 - particular job so you're not going to
62:44 - use you know let like I'm not going to
62:47 - use WordPress and react this combo for
62:49 - every single site that I do for every
62:51 - client that's not the answer sometimes
62:53 - you don't need that uh so
62:56 - you know don't don't be so worried about
62:59 - the absolute right way to do things uh
63:03 - you know you'll you'll eventually just
63:05 - keep doing keep learning and eventually
63:07 - you will find you'll get better and
63:10 - you'll find one of the best ways uh but
63:14 - like John said there's a debate about
63:17 - what the best way is
63:21 - usually okay let's see somebody asked if
63:24 - I'm selftaught this is officially my
63:26 - longest video ever so if you're still if
63:29 - anybody's still watching at this point
63:30 - we have well 55 viewers is that looking
63:33 - at the analytics so thanks for sticking
63:36 - around for so long um I'm GNA have to
63:38 - wrap this up soon because it's my
63:41 - anniversary and I want to get out of
63:42 - work here at a decent time but uh I'll
63:46 - answer these last couple questions are
63:47 - you self-taught yes I am self-taught my
63:51 - degree is in Business Administration I
63:54 - specialize in economics ICS and finance
63:57 - uh I did take so I I'll say this in high
64:01 - school I took a course where we learn
64:02 - basic HTML and CSS and that was a long
64:06 - time that was maybe I took the course
64:09 - like 2002 2003 somewhere around there in
64:13 - college I took a C++ programming
64:17 - course I started a course in web
64:20 - development and then I dropped it
64:22 - halfway through and now it's crazy that
64:24 - this is what I do for living but that's
64:26 - it that's the only
64:28 - um formal education that I've had I
64:32 - think there's value in computer science
64:34 - degree and I know that there are big
64:36 - gaps in my understanding of computer
64:38 - science because I've learned on my own
64:41 - uh but in terms of me getting my job
64:43 - done I I I know a lot I know what I need
64:46 - to know uh to to get my job done and my
64:49 - clients are are satisfied
64:51 - I've I've you know thankfully I've never
64:54 - had a client that was not satisfied with
64:57 - their site and let's say didn't want to
64:58 - pay me or got their site redone so I've
65:01 - been you know I've been really lucky uh
65:04 - in that
65:06 - regard uh
65:08 - but I have been self-taught so I've um
65:11 - if if you're interested in knowing kind
65:13 - of my my route that I've taken to teach
65:16 - myself uh comment below comment and ask
65:19 - me below and then I can kind of give you
65:22 - some of the resources that I found most
65:24 - helpful will say this I don't think I've
65:27 - spent more than $30 in the
65:30 - last 10 years on resources for learning
65:33 - how to do web development the best
65:35 - resources I found are
65:37 - free are you some Joey asked if I'm a
65:40 - freelancer I do some freelance work now
65:43 - uh I'm employed full-time at uh
65:46 - Franciscan University as a front-end
65:48 - developer I occasionally do freelance
65:51 - work but it needs to be a project that
65:54 - I'm really interested in
65:56 - because it does take time away from my
65:57 - family I have a wife I have four kids uh
66:01 - so I it has to be either what I'm
66:04 - interested in or let's say they offer to
66:06 - pay me a lot of money and I just can't
66:07 - turn it down otherwise I'd rather spend
66:09 - that time with my kids uh I don't know
66:12 - about all of you
66:14 - but I have a tendency to get kind of
66:16 - really into what I'm doing in coding and
66:19 - if I don't watch myself I can spend all
66:20 - my time doing coding and thinking about
66:23 - coding and it's easy to or your family
66:27 - which in the grand scheme of things is
66:29 - more important especially you my kids
66:31 - are all little I don't want to miss that
66:33 - so the freelancing is kind of taking a
66:36 - back burner
66:41 - now okay someone says to be fair react
66:44 - for WordPress is already
66:46 - Overkill uh I'm not sure exactly what
66:49 - you mean by that so I'm not saying I I
66:51 - disagree with that uh in this case you
66:55 - could check out some my earlier videos
66:56 - where I explain why I'm doing it like
66:58 - this I think
66:59 - it's it's appropriate in this case at
67:02 - least I think so but I'm definitely open
67:04 - to hearing uh alternatives to
67:08 - that someone says ha happy birthday it's
67:11 - it's my wedding anniversary so thanks
67:13 - for that but it's actually my 10year
67:15 - wedding
67:16 - anniversary um someone says thanks for
67:18 - the
67:19 - patience um someone again asked what
67:21 - resources I used please put that in the
67:24 - comments I don't I I want to look up and
67:26 - give you some links so I'm not going to
67:27 - talk about it right now put in the
67:28 - comments and give you a better answer
67:31 - someone says hello
67:33 - Geeks uh okay we have a couple more
67:35 - people saying the same thing what route
67:37 - do you take to teach yourself throw
67:39 - throw it in the comments and I'll give
67:40 - you a much better answer I I'll think it
67:42 - out and type it out with some links for
67:44 - you why did you drop web development uh
67:47 - I'll tell you why I dropped web
67:48 - development I took way too many credits
67:50 - I think I was taking 23 credit hours
67:52 - that semester which um I don't know how
67:56 - credit hours work in universities around
67:58 - the world but at least in the United
67:59 - States a normal full-time schedule is
68:02 - considered it's 12 credit hours so I was
68:06 - almost double what they consider
68:07 - full-time so that was a lot for me also
68:10 - um the teacher of that course had a
68:13 - really heavy accent and I had a hard
68:15 - time understanding him I'm usually
68:17 - pretty good with accents but I just had
68:18 - a hard time and what he was teaching I
68:21 - knew enough about web development at
68:23 - that point to realize what he was
68:24 - teaching was several years out of date
68:27 - and I just I didn't like that so I
68:30 - needed to drop a class anyway because it
68:31 - was too overwhelming so that was on the
68:33 - top of the
68:38 - list someone says they have dreams with
68:40 - me coding I'm the same way I'm
68:43 - definitely same way uh that's that's
68:46 - cool sometimes I actually dream up
68:48 - solutions that really work it doesn't
68:50 - happen all the time but it it does
68:51 - happen so I think it's cool
68:55 - all right
68:57 - someone I'm going to have to cut this
68:59 - off soon because uh I'm getting to the
69:01 - bottom of the live stream and then more
69:03 - you know I get more comments so uh I'm
69:05 - going to say this is the last last set
69:08 - you know whatever's on the screen here
69:09 - at the bottom this is the last set that
69:10 - I'm going to do and I'm going to have to
69:11 - cut it off uh someone says there are
69:14 - support analyst trying to transition out
69:15 - of support into development I have a b
69:17 - completed a bachelor's degree Oracle
69:19 - certified developed an Android app and
69:21 - no Dev experience how do I transition
69:24 - successfully
69:25 - um I would say build some side projects
69:29 - uh learn as much you can build some side
69:31 - projects or get some paid freelance work
69:33 - if you can uh you can also contribute to
69:36 - open source projects on GitHub and
69:38 - that'll build up your portfolio that's
69:40 - really all you need if you have a good
69:42 - portfolio that's what employers want to
69:45 - see the most at least employers that
69:47 - know what they're doing when they hire a
69:48 - developer uh the most important thing is
69:51 - can this person do the job and have they
69:54 - proven it by their previous projects
69:57 - that's what I would work on uh if I were
69:59 - you that's what I look for when when I'm
70:02 - looking at resumés to higher developers
70:04 - the most important thing to me is you
70:06 - know the experience just show me what
70:08 - you've
70:09 - built uh my Twitter somebody asked for
70:12 - my Twitter handle it's in the
70:13 - description of this
70:23 - video okay uh hi how to handle errors in
70:26 - the fetch response uh maybe we can go
70:28 - over that in a later
70:36 - video okay
70:38 - so I'm going to cut that off now because
70:41 - this video has gone super long and it's
70:43 - going to be intimidating for people who
70:45 - are going to want to rewatch it I'll
70:47 - have to make a note that the last half
70:49 - hour or so is all kind of question and
70:51 - answer
70:52 - session but thanks for all the
70:56 - engagement uh I think this is by far
70:58 - like the most active live chat that I've
71:00 - had in the video and I really like that
71:02 - and I like that so many of you have said
71:05 - you know you're you're finding this
71:07 - valuable and I really want your feedback
71:10 - so I'm pretty new to live streaming I'm
71:12 - sure I could be doing this you know a
71:14 - lot better so uh any advice you can give
71:18 - me put it in the comments direct message
71:20 - me on Twitter uh have a great weekend
71:22 - everybody I'll be back on Monday at 11:
71:25 - :30 a.m. eastern time I'll schedule the
71:31 - uh the event before I leave today so so
71:33 - it'll be on the you know it be on the
71:35 - channel and you'll see it but it'll be a
71:37 - different time than
71:39 - normal so uh I I had a great time with
71:42 - you guys today hopefully this was
71:44 - helpful to you and I'll be back on
71:47 - Monday

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody it's Jesse if you're new to the show uh I live stream my work it's just my normal work that I do every day the whole point is to show what a frontend developer does even the mistakes that I make hopefully I don't make too many mistakes but i' just like people to see that you don't have to be perfect to get a job as a developer especially people who are just starting out today we're going to do something that took me a while to figure out how to do it's really cool and useful and if you want to be able to do serice side rendering and make API calls then this this is one way to do it it's not the only way but this is the way that I found that's the easiest for me before we get started I'm gonna somebody asked in a live stream how long this is going to be about a half an hour if there's a lot of people in the chat asking questions sometimes I go over but I don't think I've ever gone longer than 45 minutes but the the code portion of it will be over in about a half an hour so 230 PM eastern time uh before we get started just want to give a shout out to my wife it's our 10th anniversary so sometimes she watches the show so in case she's watching happy anniversary uh I went over this yesterday the the schedule for next week so I'm not going to go over it in depth I just wanted to put it up here so you could see it I'm going to be at syntax Con in South Carolina next week the the end of next week so my schedule's going to be off and I have a lot of meetings early in the week so we're going to live stream Monday Tuesday at 1130 a.m. eastern time I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it Wednesday I'll try and then I'm going to get in touch with the people who are organizing syntax con and see if they're cool with me doing some live streaming maybe some interviews from syntax conon so I'll let you know when I hear back from them and see if I can do that all right so let's oh thanks uh Julian said congrats what time is there now it's uh it's 2 p.m where I'm at all right so let me let me flip over here and uh show you let me show you the page that we're going to be putting this on and I'm going to show you the data you can see the data on the screen right now okay so I'll pull this page over so this is a news page there's nothing on it right now it's going to be a Blog style page someone in the live chat asked NYC I'm actually I'm I'm in the same time zone as New York City but I'm in yeah I'm actually in Ohio I'm I'm on the very Eastern edge of Ohio so I'm Prett pretty close to Pittsburgh it's about a half hour drive for me to get to Pittsburgh so you you may be more familiar with where Pittsburgh is than where Stubenville is which is the city that I'm in right now somebody says hello from laia cool yeah so usually I I do have people give you know shout out where they're from uh I don't know the last week people just started doing that and I thought it was cool so if you want to put in the live stream where you're from and then at the end of the show I'll go through and uh just say where everybody was from so this is the news page like I said it's just going to be a Blog Page so what we want to do is we want to get data from a WordPress installation that's on a totally different server and we want to display that data here using the WordPress API I'm not going to go over how to set up anything in WordPress but the API is now uh it comes with WordPress course you don't need any extra plugins or anything it it should just work I don't think hey somebody's from Charleston South Carolina I'm gonna be in Charleston next week so uh Joey on the live chat uh I'll be in Charleston I'll be there Wednesday Thursday and Friday of next week for the uh St tax conon uh conference you should check it out if you can if you have time so like I said the word it's actually super easy I don't even think you have to switch on the API I think it's just on by default somebody can correct me if if I'm wrong but when I started working with it oh it's probably been a year maybe maybe a little more than a year probably a year and a half since I started working with the WordPress API you did have to install some plugins but uh now it's it's easier to work with so we want to grab that data but we don't just want to pull it in you know on the client side because if we pull in that data you know on the client side in the browser it'll be fine for for a regular person viewing it but if a search engine wants to check out your page they're going to see a blank page if if all your contents coming from an API search engines are well some of them I mean Google's uh Google search crawler can handle some JavaScript pretty well but it doesn't stick around long enough to get an API call back it doesn't matter how fast the call is I've tested it before with um W with just like you know test data that that should have loaded almost instantaneously and and you still it's not it doesn't work with search engines so the only way that I know of to make this site search engine friendly is to actually make the API call on the server okay so we're we're going to run node on the server right now it's just a local uh development environment so it's just on my local machine I'll do a live stream maybe maybe sometime next week if I can about actually setting up the server but on the server we're going to make the call and then we're going to render the HTML based on that data we get from the API on the server and what's going to get sent to the client on that first load is all the markup so to make this a little bit easier we are using nextjs so check out next I I have links to everything that I'm going to talk about in the description so if I mentioned something you're not familiar with check out the description for this video and and the links I do have this repo up now it's it's on GitHub the link is there uh the last couple shows I didn't have the repo up yet but now you can you can check everything out so we don't really need to see this until we finish the code now so I'm going to move this off just to show you what the data is going to look like let me zoom in a little bit here okay this is what WordPress sends back if I if I hit this URL it sends me back you know some Json all we're going to get today is I want this title and I want the content I don't really need anything else we'll see in in later videos I'll I'll start to get really detailed in in what I'm getting from here and actually get rid of all the stuff I don't need just to make it you know just a little bit faster uh but for now this is just what it looks like I have nothing special the only thing I added special in terms of parameters on the end I don't know if you can see that I did add uh posts per page 100 but I think I only have four demo posts set up so it doesn't even make sense um I'm going to move this off to the side we won't really need to see that we only need to bring that back if something goes wrong all right so now let's let's check out the code and we'll go to our page news news JS if you're not familiar with how next Works uh next basically is a way to let you get started with react very quickly it comes built in with a lot of cool stuff like serers side rendering and all your pages in your site all you have to do is make a file in this Pages folder and then the routing just works it handles all the routing for you so this is our news page all we have here we're uh we're importing some components just some basic things our footer uh our title we have this head tag is is custom for for next so we imported here it's next head so this is uh not exactly you won't have something like this in every react site that you do at least not not in the same way that NEX does it the uh the only different thing we had from from previous shows is we've now added this import isomorphic fetch so so uh um I'm going to look back the live stream I'm going to ignore the live stream for a little bit just to get through some of this section and I'll check back in later so if you're asking a question and I don't respond right away I will I will towards the end so if you're not familiar with fetch fetch is kind of the newest way to make to make calls you know apis basically it's what you would have done with Ajax if you're using jQuery or just a normal xhr uh now you can use fetch for and it's super simple you'll see the code in a second when I when I type it out the only thing is it's not supported everywhere yet I mean obviously older browsers pretty much every version of Internet Explorer I mean that's that's not really new St uh later on I'm sure you know most browsers will have support but for right now you have to use polyfills for Fetch and in particular if we want to use Fetch with node on the server side we can't just use fetch you normally uh because it's it's normally a browser thing and node is not running in the browser so we use this uh npm module isomorphic fetch it actually it comes packaged with next uh so that's why we can just use it like this I didn't have to install it separately if if you looked at the package Json file it's it's not in the list of things so it's nice that it comes with this there are some newer npm modules uh that do this as well uh fetch works for me I might check out some of the uh isomorph morphic fetch works for me I might check out some of the new ones later on if I think uh it'll provide Advantage if you know of any of you know newer versions of this uh that you like you know let me know let me know what's good about them so let's get started I'm just going to start typing out what we need so next comes with this get initial props uh function that's anything inside get initial props that's going to run on the server side so that call is going to run but then if you switch over to client side routing later on it'll also run that you know when you're doing so with next you can do server side first then switch to client side once things are loaded you can just stick with server side so that every every time you click a link it's a complete page refresh you know you can kind you do it however you want to do it you can do custom routing but right now we're going to start with and this is pretty basic this is pretty much how it is in the next documentation so you can check that out too if you want to learn more about it we need to get initial props okay and just you I think you'll be really amazed at how simple this is I know I was uh because I like I said I I tried for a long time to get server side routing to work with react and I just couldn't find I couldn't find a good tutorial that was at my level at the time you know sometimes you find a tutorial and it's just it's just too advanced you know uh but this was you know this was at my level when I needed it all right so I'm just going to make a couple of variables here if you're not familiar with this syntax you've using const instead of ver uh this is es6 syntax or ex 2015 so this is just I mean a short explanation is when I make something a const it's never going to change I I can't I can't change this uh this variable later on uh there's some other things with with hoisting that happens when you use con or let uh but let kind of beond what we're talking about today all right so we we're going to use a URL and I'm going to just I'm going to copy and paste in that URL that I showed you just a minute ago where we're going to get that data so I like to you can type the URL straight into your your fetch uh function but I like to keep it a little bit more clean with some variables and I usually like to have my parameters separate it's not going to be really obvious right now why we need that but later on we're going to have like some really long strings of parameters they're going to add to this so it's better to separate them and easier to read uh so for now we can just add we just add posts because the demo uh WordPress site that I'm going to pull this data from it only has post right now uh later on we set up WordPress to have lots of custom post types and and we'll pull different things and now we're going to get to you know these first two variables this was just kind of the way I organize things now we're getting to you know the part the important part that you really need so this this uh syntax this part of it the next three lines are going to be pretty much straight from uh nextjs straight from their documentation wait let's see okay so this is it for fetch I mean think back if you've done especially if you've worked with xhr or Ajax think about how many lines it took you to accomplish an API call this is all you need now and if I didn't put them in you know these variables here you you could just put this whole URL right here it's it's so much simpler so if you haven't used fetch yet use it I may do a a tutorial video later on about how to set up your site to be able to use fetch in the browser and support older browsers uh and how to set up that polyfill I just glanced over at the live chat somebody asked a good question uh why is the head in the metadata inside that div yeah so this is weird to have a div here but I needed to have everything so basically I needed to have the body tag have these styles on it but I have no way at least no way that I know of with this setup to directly put something on the body tag so instead of looking it up and trying to figure out how to do it I thought I'd just try putting a div here around everything and see if it works and it did work so I would guess that there's a better way to do this but since I have such a short timeline for getting this site live I'm just going to stick with this for now because it works and then hopefully later on find a better way to do it but this looks a little weird but it it does actually work all right so let's finish this off right we're going to get Json back all right so we're going to save that in a variable called Data you can call that whatever you want okay and then all we're going to do now is just return we're going to turn that data okay now what this is going to do is this data is now going to be available as a prop so we can go down here and you yesterday we I explained how to use props so it's basically going to be the same the same concept here we're going to add this data is a prop prop but I'm going to do I'm going to show you how how I will be using this I'm usually not going to make an API call to just pull one piece of data I'm going to make an API call to pull a bunch of stuff in this case a bunch of posts and I want to Loop through all those posts and then render them you know a big list of them so I'm just going to type everything here for Simplicity normally you'd want to make another component and pass it to the component and we'll see that later on but for now we don't need all that uh we just want to make sure that this works make sure we get everything on the page that we need so we'll go this props and if I am going too fast I'll answer some questions in a little bit uh the same person asked the question about the div uh around everything thing says as long as we all agree that it's a hack definitely it is a hack but uh sometimes that's the way it is you just you need to get it done and you need to get it done very quickly so you have to resort to a hack so let's go this props and then data right so we named that data and we could have named it whatever we wanted but data is a nice kind of generic term and we we want to use map so we're going to use map a map function and we're going to we're going to call it a post since we're getting posts it makes sense you can call this whatever you want so that each time they Loop through a different piece a different piece of data that's going to be a different Post in our case we'll probably name this something different when we start using custom post types for each different post type we'll name it that that helps keep keep things pretty clear I'm also going to put this variable here just uh to keep track of what number we're on you'll see why I'm going to use that in a second and all we need now I need now is just to put in some of the HTML that's going to contain this data so we want to return and if you're not familiar at all with react all we just did here when we put this this curly bracket here is and now anything inside these curly brackets is Javascript we can type plain JavaScript in here so we've kind of started with JavaScript inside this this return now we're it's basically HTML with with a few differences but pretty much straight HTML and then now we've dropped back into JavaScript inside of here so if we want to Output HTML again we need to return it so we're just going to add another return and we're going to just start out we're just going to make a div to hold this data uh we're going to give it a class name you can't just put class uh you you'll get an error if you try to just put class you need to put class name there are a few other properties that you need to do some different things with uh Source set is one of them you have to type SRC and then capital C uh if you you're making a form or something and you use the four attribute uh I think you have to do HTML for with a capital f so uh I think they have all those listed on the react website just you know which which properties are supported uh but if you're getting weird errors it's for me at least a lot of my erors are resulting from forgetting to put class name instead of class so let's give this we'll just make this a row we're using materialized framework so a lot of these styles are built into that framework and then now here's where that that I variable is going to come in for react likes to have a key if you're going to have you know a bunch of divs that all have kind of the same thing in them that you're you're iterating over they like to have key so Oops I messed that up I don't want it to be a string I want it to be a variable uh so let's drop down so you see notice now we're in that return again so if I want to do JavaScript I do have to put these brackets again it can get confusing we're switching back and forth between you know what looks like HTML and JavaScript so we're just going to close that we're going to close that div inside that div we're just going to make an H1 you know just a normal H1 tag uh to have our our title remember we just want to get the title of the post and the content so we're going to go post see so now that now that we're in here and we've named we've named this post we can just go straight into post and inside the post we want to get the title all right title and then if you remember it actually dropped down One More Level so the way WordPress uh formats the Json you can't just say title you have to go to rendered and that's that's it we that should output the title now for our content I'm going to do something a little bit different and I'll I'll explain why I'm going to give this a class of flow text materialize has this flow text class that resizes the text BAS based on your screen with kind of responsive font thing uh and that'll make the text a little bit more readable for us but I'm not going to put the data here I'm actually going to use this and this is not as scary as it sounds all right so I'm going to use dangerously set iner HTM ml so we're dropping back down into JavaScript here to do this okay so this is built into react I can't spell today okay so let me explain why we're doing this I will pull let's pull this back this uh this data back in I'm gonna flip switch over really quick let me make it a little bit bigger so since we're we're trying to pull this content rendered if you notice there is HTML in here all right there's a P tag in here and there there could be anything right this is WordPress so you somebody could type type in you know all a lot of different tags think if you had like uls you know unordered lists you know Lis you you know you could see there could be a lot of HTML if we just put this here like we did for the title we're going to see that markup and we don't want to see that markup uh I'm just checking out the live stream yeah I know this this seems pretty harsh but if you have control of where you're getting the data from and you know what's going to be put in there because you're the one that's going to be putting it in there or you know somebody in your on your team that you trust then there's really nothing wrong with doing this if you're just pulling in data from some other source that you have no control over yeah then maybe you might want you might want to think about not doing this uh you know so you might end up pulling in some some harmful code you don't want to do it but in this case you know this this WordPress site is on it's on my servers I'm actually the only person at this point that even has access to the admin panel so so it's okay it's it's not as it's it's not as crazy as it sounds it's it just sounds really harsh to put that in there all right so but you can see why we need to do that because we're going to have HTML tags inside this content so we need to render those tags as well all right so I'm going to save this and then I'm going to show you the page and we're going to see all right now I'm going to bring this in and as as it I said at the beginning I want you to see all my mistakes so you can see we have a mistake it's saying cannot read property map of undefined so somehow I've messed up in the API call so let's check this out I do want to just refresh this quickly to see here's a tip I've I've had this happen to me so many times I'm not sure why when I just hit save and it does the hot reload sometimes things don't work so before you start to despair do do a refresh sometimes it will actually work after the refresh and for whatever reason it just didn't work I'm sure there's some good reason why the the hot reload you know doesn't work for some things but I'm glad that worked and and we tried that before I went back in so if you can see this part part that was blank before now has our titles I'm using the bacon ipsum for this uh test data that has all our titles and then it has our content he and that's how you pull in data I want to let's look at let's view this Source oh this is going to be ugly I don't know if we'll be able to get to it but basically if you view the source you know you'll see all the HTML there here we go you know you see all this HTML here normally if you have a page that's making an API call and it's on the client side you know you won't see all the markup in in a view Source you'll see it if you inspect it in Dev tools but not of VI source so this just shows this is what search engines will see they're seeing all your data okay before I go to the live chat I just want to ask you guys you notice this is different from what it was a couple days ago it used to have an overlay this kind of white overlay over the entire image and then the title was centered vertically and horizontally I liked how that looked but after a meeting with the people I'm making the site for they wanted to see the full color of this image they didn't want this overlay on it at all I don't really want to put the title down here and have you know forced the rest of the content even farther down the page I mean because let's see you know normal screen is going to be more like like this for most people so you can see it's already kind of messed up the formatting I do have it zoomed in though let me take that back down down to normal size okay so my question to you is I don't like how this I don't like how this looks obviously do you know some way that we can still make this readable and also keep the image you know for the most part without an overlay so I'm thinking maybe of like having this fade a little bit more we'll see I've thought about just removing this section entirely and just having a title and then trying to work these images in some other way so let me know in in the comments uh or you know here in the live chat I would I'd really appreciate your opinion on that I've already spent a lot more time than I wanted to just kind of trying things out and nothing has nothing has has looked right to me all right so now if uh if you don't want to stick around for me to go through the questions in the live chat Now's the Time to Leave it's already been a half an hour otherwise if you have a little bit more time I'm going to go through the live chat uh I'm going to read out where everybody's from and I'm going to answer questions if you have any questions that you didn't get in the live chat you can put them in the comments if you don't want to put your question in the comments for everybody to read just uh direct message me on Twitter uh my link to my Twitter account is in the descript description all right so I'm scrolling up to the top now of the live chat and let's see we have someone from Guatemala and people saying congratulations thanks for saying congratulations if you missed at the beginning it's I said it's my 10year uh wedding anniversary today so uh thanks for the the congratulations guys so from laia Cherry Valley Illinois Columbia Charleston London England Baghdad Atlanta Tokyo Canada Brazil uh it's B Horizon Brazil Cordova Argentina Albania okay we have a question what's the difference between isomorphic Fetch and a normal request to an API so uh Marius asked asked this question so a normal request what normally I I don't know about you but I would say all the API requests that I had done up until the point when I started using react in this way was I just made it on the client side so usually I would use Ajax because most of the sites I worked on were already loading jQuery for some other reason so I would just use Ajax and I would make the request like that I did start to switch over and use fetch but all those were on the client side so everything would would load you know the JavaScript would load on the page and then the call would be made but search engines couldn't see the data from that call when we're using isomorphic fetch isomorphic is a term that's used at least in uh in web development to mean that uh it's like something that runs on the client and the server both uh sometimes they call it Universal uh so you'll hear those kind of used interchangeably but to say it's an is isomorphic fetch just means that it is it is fetch so it's it's basically a newer version of an Ajax call that can run on the server in this case it's running uh we're running node on the server so it's a version of fetch that can run on node and that's necessary as I mentioned earlier to be able to render all the content that you want the uh the search engines to see on the server and then send it all all out on that first load so hopefully that that answered your question uh if not you know uh comment and uh I can answer it in more depth later on all right we got somebody from South Africa said they're enjoying the stream thanks I'm glad you're enjoying it Kazakhstan PESA Brazil sorry if I'm mispronouncing the places that you're from I'm trying my best India all right somebody from India says uh I'll I'll try to pronounce AB abishek from India is saying that these videos keep me a hell of lot motivated and helps keep the procrastination on hold awesome I'm really glad to hear that uh I'm pretty much I'll only keep doing these if I think you guys are getting some benefit and sorry guys guys and girls I I don't mean any offense by using that uh so um yeah so let me know if you guys think if you people think that that it's uh useful to you you know please let me know and and that's motivation for me to keep doing it and try to do a better job if you have any advice for me on how to make these better please let me know okay somebody says so don't use react router when during stra side rendering yeah I haven't worked with react router enough to even be able to address that because next handles a lot of the routing we're going to do a little bit of custom routing and we'll get into that probably next week but I I don't know enough about it so I can't really comment on that what place is your desktop background image from what is my desktop background image right now um I don't know this maybe this is the default that comes with Mac so I'm using uh Mac uh OS 10 Sierra as the operating system so I guess that's the default I don't know let me know if anybody else is using that I think that's the default uh and I'm assuming it's that they're talking about the Sierra Nevada mountain range is here in the US I I don't really know usually the last couple operating systems for Mac have been named after mountains and then the default image is that mountain okay we had some stuff I answered some of this okay somebody said we can move the head into header. JS component that's what I thought so I actually tried to move the stuff in the header let me bring that over so we know know what we're talking about so uh so we had somebody in the live chat mention that we can move all this this head stuff into a component I tried so here's what I tried to do I moved all this to a component and then I just loaded that component here and it it didn't work basically the the page actually did load I didn't get you know the the pink error screen but all this stuff that I was trying to bring in the stylesheets and the fonts none of them loaded neither the the title didn't load none of this loaded so I don't know what the problem is I I would definitely like to just put this all on a component the one reason why I don't mind it being here is that I can customize this although I certainly could have that as a prop in the component and that in so uh one thing I could try that I didn't think about until now is you know what if I just copied all of this including this this head component into a component and then I imported this next head into that component I don't know that might work I'm GNA have to try that so thanks for uh for mentioning that because it kind of made me rethink what I did and realize maybe there is a way to make it work so I'll maybe I'll try that uh after the live stream today okay uh mobin 92 says I see that the site includes the stylesheets fonts and scripts do we have to do that for every page again and again isn't there some kind of templating mechanism oh yeah I mean that's basically uh kind of like the last comment yeah I think there should be a better way to do this I was reading through the nextjs documentation to see if there was something like that I think I remember reading at some point about some layout component and I'm assuming that it can do something like that I just need to read more into it uh from the last time I used nextjs on a project they've had a lot of updates and a lot of new features so I need to go back in and kind of relearn it you know what what are the best ways to use it now so at the time when I first used it I didn't find a better way to do this for right now since I don't have that many pages it's faster for me to just do this but if I had a larger site I would definitely try to figure out some way to just put this in a component have it you know templating like you said uh but for now you know once again because because of the very short time frame that the site needs to launch I'm probably not going to have time to find the answer to this and to really mess with it I I kind of I wish I had more time to really do this you know the best way that I can okay side effect and react okay we have from side effect and react app I use Redux Saga or Redux stunk I've heard about Redux I haven't worked with Redux yet but I've heard a lot of good things about it watched some videos on it so uh yeah definitely I from the little I know about it I can recommend it as as being something uh really useful to use with react okay almost to the bottom of the live chat um I'm seeing the comments now when I use that dangerously set enter HTML someone says they uh they hate WordPress but need WordPress I have I have a somewhat similar feeling about WordPress I like how easy it is for people who don't know code to edit things in WordPress and that's why I use it in this case that that is kind of why I'm using it because we're going to have some uh some graduate students who are going to who don't know anything about code are going to need to input some data but I don't really like working with the PHP and the uh the templating system within WordPress and I'm not I'm not really interested in leveling up my PHP skills at this point I'd rather work on my JavaScript skills so that's why I'm using Wordpress like this if there were some kind of less heavy content management system that I could pull data from that was as stable and as userfriendly as WordPress I would definitely try that out as I scroll down now it's uh seems like the same reason they said they use it for clients and that's actually that that's it uh it's it's really easy for clients to to manage someone ask Anthony Lopez ask why is coding so fun uh I think coding is fun CU you're building something you're building something that usually helps people in some way you can build things that are are beautiful when you build you get immediate feedback which is really awesome and if you mess it up it usually it doesn't cost you anything you just you know you just undo whatever you did you go back to the last commit so that's really cool other you know I I enjoy building things in in the real world too but but you know if you're if you mess something up when you're building things in the real world world then you usually can't reuse it and you have to go buy more materials I I think it's awesome that you can just try things out when you're building a website or an app and not have to worry about messing it up you know you just make another Branch for your code you know with Git try out whatever crazy thing you want to do if it works awesome if it doesn't work well you just go back to you know your original branch and you know leave it for later on try to figure it out later I think you know that's that's cool for me and I really like learning uh learning all the the latest stuff so I don't know maybe it's not like that for everybody but at least for me that's you know that's what I can think of in just in a minute or two here of why I like coding so much somebody asked if it's a pretty common practice so Joey ask is it pretty common practice to just use WordPress for its backend API and build your own front end I don't think it's common yet so I first heard about this probably maybe two years ago or maybe a year and a half ago and it wasn't really common they were saying that the WordPress API at that point wasn't stable and it could change so you really shouldn't use it but I found some sites that were actually using it you know in production so I decided to give it a shot and I built a few sites with it that are they're actually live and and they're working well and they have been working you know with with no no downtime for months I've had no problem with it so yeah it's not common yet but I definitely think it it could end up being common I'd actually I have a project in mind to make a very easy way for people who use WordPress to use react as kind of the front end without them having to know that much about react so it would be limited in that it would you basically be limited to your your default pages and posts in WordPress but they would really just need to plug in their their URL and then the react part of it would just kind of take over and and put out the data so it would be it would be easier for people they would have to still know a little bit about you a little bit of JavaScript but it would be much easier than trying to do it all yourself so maybe I'll get i'll get to the point where I have some time to to make that and uh maybe maybe you can help me out with that I I'll certainly H have that the Open Source on GitHub if I do it okay almost to the bottom I was almost to the bottom maybe I think I had some more some more people typing in and now the bottom is getting farther away of this of this live chat all right so okay now thanks for all this advice on the uh the text the title text maybe fade the size I'm yeah I'm going to try that so Anthony suggested maybe fade the sides maybe another black bar under the image with the white text in it make it black put a background on only the text yeah yeah I see what you guys are saying I'll try I'll definitely try these out change the color drop shadow yeah I've done that before I really hate to add a drop shadow since I'm not using it anywhere else but um I I'll have to try these out and see what they look like I think that that oval fade maybe maybe that would work too okay so somebody asks MJS versus nextjs I don't have enough experience with M to comment on that I like nextjs they seem to add new features really quickly and be really responsive uh on GitHub when you raise an issue so I I don't have a problem with it there are some things about next that I wish it could do that it can't right now or it's possible I I just don't know how to do it and I'll probably get to some of those things maybe next week in the videos or the week after after uh but I don't know I don't really know very much at all about M so guess you fill me in in the comments and let me know what you think so we have somebody from Romania from Poland Orlando Philippines India New Jersey uh Saudi Arabia India Russia okay we have a question here from Josh so Josh began coding about one week ago any advice for feeling overwhelmed at the beginning and not giving up oh man yeah uh that feeling of being overwhelmed will you'll have that even after you're not a beginner anymore but it gets better you don't have it as often and you kind of know how to push through it don't feel like you have to learn everything all at once if you watch a YouTube video or or you know read a a blog post on some concept and you're just totally lost don't worry about it watch it again watch it two or three times practice a little bit and then go come back to it it'll be a great feeling for you when you come back to a video that made no sense to you you know a month or two ago and now you totally understand it so I would say just keep trying don't don't try to do things that are Way Beyond your level you know take it kind of slower uh don't be I'm I'm always going back and doing tutorials that are like beginner tutorials and I usually fly through a lot of the stuff but I always pick up something useful that I didn't know so I'd say you know don't don't have too much pride to uh you know to go back to the beginning and kind of try to relearn some things you'll always pick up something new I mean don't spend all your time in the beginner tutorials but uh I I'm I'm with you and feeling over overwhelmed at times usually at some point in a project I I hit a point where I just think like how did I get myself to this point how am I ever going to get this done on time and have it work and you can't give up you know you still got to you you got to ship the site you know it has to go live you know you're being paid to do that so you just work through it just break it up into small tasks use resource online you stack Overflow uh ask questions you know on YouTube videos and if you know somebody else who codes have them take a look at your code but I mean I guess the the best advice I could give you is just don't give up and realize that the overwhelm feeling is is normal and you'll get better and that feeling will slowly start to go away and not be as bad so hopefully that helps all right we have somebody from Salvador Brazil also you know if anybody else has any uh advice for someone just starting out feeling overwhelmed please post that in the comments somebody from Seattle turkey okay so we have some people some people commenting back uh saying take Little Steps somebody else knows the feeling uh oh someone said is it inspired me watching you well thanks I I appre appreciate that I'm glad it it's providing some value to you uh please save this stream yeah all the streams somebody just said please save the stream all the streams pretty much like five minutes after the stream is over they go um they're available on the free code Camp Channel I do have some other videos on my own channel and that's Linked In the description I'm going to do some prerecorded tutorials and put that on that channel as well but I'm probably not going to have time until after this launch the site launches later this month and then and uh so if you have any requests for tutorials that'll be kind of shorter more to the point tutorials uh let me know if if you want to learn about anything and and if I know about it I'll make a video well what can you do if you have many pages so somebody uh uh mobin 92 asked about what can you do if you have many pages and I think this is referring back to that you know having all the uh the whole content of the head tag in every page I I don't know the answer to that right now I'm I'm assuming there is an answer and I just don't know it yet and I haven't taken the time to try to find it yet same style that menu okay so we have another recommendation for the nav menu uh I'll just I'll skip over those for now and I'll I'll read them because that's more of advice directly to me and I'll try out these different things all right we have another question mads Jensen is asking studying web development at my school but when I showed them the website free code Camp they said that they coded wrong so I'm so confused they say you use too much too much div HMO 5 uh yeah I don't I don't know what to say I'm not sure if you're using something like bootstrap or like I'm using materialized sometimes that's the way you have to do it you use you use a lot of divs I'm sure there's different philosophies on how you should structure your HTML I don't know that I'm in a position to comment on which one is the best or which one's right or wrong I mean to me at the end of the day you got to make a site that's userfriendly to your users if it's also coded beautifully so that somebody can look at your code and it's awesome then that's great too but uh especially if you're just starting out which people who are using free code Camp are usually just starting out I don't know it maybe I don't know if this is good advice or not but I would say don't worry as much about your style of coating don't don't fret about indentation and how many divs you're using try to learn the basics try to make some cool stuff and get yourself excited about coding you know later on when you get a lot better you know then you can worry about those tiny details like that but uh I just uh to me I think sometimes people spend way too much time on those tiny little details that most people will never even notice in your code because the majority of people looking at your site are not developers so you guys can weigh in in the comments on that let me know if you disagree but I would say you know don't don't worry about that free code Camp's going to give you a lot of good advice and things and uh I'm I'm not sure why they're why they're saying that it's it's coded wrong okay I think we're at the end now is there any other of another question is there any other CMS solution you use in your projects besides WordPress I have used in the past I've used jumla and I've used Drupal I found uh both of them to be less userfriendly both for developers and for the clients so I don't use those unless I really have to like if I'm if I need to work on an existing site and I can't and it doesn't make sense to switch it over uh I have tried out some other like kind of newer really small content Management Systems there are some that actually are built with node that I'm really excited about but I haven't found one that's that's at that level that WordPress is of of just being refined and user friendly and stable you know nothing has as big of a user base to be able to ask questions to people so I'd really love to find something especially it'd be great if I could find a Content management system that was built with node I think that would be ideal because if you're already going to use node you're using JavaScript if you're going to work with react then you can just use JavaScript to work with your content management system as well uh it could be a lot more lightweight if you don't intend to actually have templating directly with that if you're just going to use it for the API so I'm I'm still kind of waiting for something to emerge as the front runner in that area of I guess what you would call a headless content management system where you just got things through the API and is built with JavaScript that would be awesome if anybody knows about something like that uh put in the comments please and uh I'll try it out when I get a chance okay somebody's asking about es6 training um there's a lot of res I don't know off the top of my head uh where to send you for you know a good resource for es6 training I know there's a lot of good videos maybe um you know what if if you're still watching uh sorv kumars asked for es6 training if you're still watching make comment uh in this video and then I'll see that later on and maybe I can send you some links to some of the training stuff that I've used to learn es6 okay someone says yes that helped thank you so much oh you're welcome I'm glad it helped okay somebody said making your code readable is still important yes definitely uh it is definitely important to make your code readable um I would just and this is entirely my opinion but uh and this is this is coming from someone who primarily Works solo on projects I don't work with other people a lot right now on my projects so I rarely need to have other people look at my code so I'm in a different position than a lot of people who are working on a team where it's more important so you know take that into consideration with my advice but I would say the fol Focus for me is always on what is the user going to see and making that the best in second place in terms of priorities is making my code readable I'm not saying I ignore that part I do try to make it readable but if it's coming down to the wire and I only have I don't have time to do everything I'll always choose to make you know the user experience a little bit better at the expense of readability of the code and if I have time later I'll go back in and try to clean that up uh but that that's just me okay instead of Wordpress you can use ponzu written and go okay I haven't heard about ponzu so maybe I'll check that out thank you somebody asked if they should learn jQuery as soon as possible or learn first learn JS well I think it depends on what you want to do if you want to go and learn react don't worry about jQuery learn js's well if you need to make money right now and let's say you're doing some freelance work there are a lot of sites that use jQuery and if you want to work on those sites to update them you know then you'll need to know some jQuery so it really depends on where you're at if you know if you get hired somewhere and their site uses jQuery obviously you need to learn that so I don't really know where you're at but um if if you don't need to use jQuery right now then learn learn the basics of JavaScript okay but you never know I mean sometimes I I've done a lot of work that I didn't really want to do and um but you got to do it you got to pay the bills you got to feed your family so um you learn what you have to learn to do that so I'm I'm not going to judge you for uh for going with jQuery if you need to all right this is a good comment here and and we are actually TW Wards the end uh so John heiner says you'll pretty much find Dev saying everything and its opposite one of the misconceptions I think newbies have is that there is one way to do things but there's an ongoing debate about most things I I love that comment so John if you're still listening thank you that's that's a wonderful comment it's entirely right when I was really new I was always trying to find like what is the best way and I'd worry like should I be learning this is this the best thing is this the best way but that's not how it is there's there's so many ways of getting the same thing done it's more about your style and what you like to do or what your client needs at the time I'm a big advocate of using the tools the best tools that you know of for that particular job so you're not going to use you know let like I'm not going to use WordPress and react this combo for every single site that I do for every client that's not the answer sometimes you don't need that uh so you know don't don't be so worried about the absolute right way to do things uh you know you'll you'll eventually just keep doing keep learning and eventually you will find you'll get better and you'll find one of the best ways uh but like John said there's a debate about what the best way is usually okay let's see somebody asked if I'm selftaught this is officially my longest video ever so if you're still if anybody's still watching at this point we have well 55 viewers is that looking at the analytics so thanks for sticking around for so long um I'm GNA have to wrap this up soon because it's my anniversary and I want to get out of work here at a decent time but uh I'll answer these last couple questions are you selftaught yes I am selftaught my degree is in Business Administration I specialize in economics ICS and finance uh I did take so I I'll say this in high school I took a course where we learn basic HTML and CSS and that was a long time that was maybe I took the course like 2002 2003 somewhere around there in college I took a C++ programming course I started a course in web development and then I dropped it halfway through and now it's crazy that this is what I do for living but that's it that's the only um formal education that I've had I think there's value in computer science degree and I know that there are big gaps in my understanding of computer science because I've learned on my own uh but in terms of me getting my job done I I I know a lot I know what I need to know uh to to get my job done and my clients are are satisfied I've I've you know thankfully I've never had a client that was not satisfied with their site and let's say didn't want to pay me or got their site redone so I've been you know I've been really lucky uh in that regard uh but I have been selftaught so I've um if if you're interested in knowing kind of my my route that I've taken to teach myself uh comment below comment and ask me below and then I can kind of give you some of the resources that I found most helpful will say this I don't think I've spent more than $30 in the last 10 years on resources for learning how to do web development the best resources I found are free are you some Joey asked if I'm a freelancer I do some freelance work now uh I'm employed fulltime at uh Franciscan University as a frontend developer I occasionally do freelance work but it needs to be a project that I'm really interested in because it does take time away from my family I have a wife I have four kids uh so I it has to be either what I'm interested in or let's say they offer to pay me a lot of money and I just can't turn it down otherwise I'd rather spend that time with my kids uh I don't know about all of you but I have a tendency to get kind of really into what I'm doing in coding and if I don't watch myself I can spend all my time doing coding and thinking about coding and it's easy to or your family which in the grand scheme of things is more important especially you my kids are all little I don't want to miss that so the freelancing is kind of taking a back burner now okay someone says to be fair react for WordPress is already Overkill uh I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that so I'm not saying I I disagree with that uh in this case you could check out some my earlier videos where I explain why I'm doing it like this I think it's it's appropriate in this case at least I think so but I'm definitely open to hearing uh alternatives to that someone says ha happy birthday it's it's my wedding anniversary so thanks for that but it's actually my 10year wedding anniversary um someone says thanks for the patience um someone again asked what resources I used please put that in the comments I don't I I want to look up and give you some links so I'm not going to talk about it right now put in the comments and give you a better answer someone says hello Geeks uh okay we have a couple more people saying the same thing what route do you take to teach yourself throw throw it in the comments and I'll give you a much better answer I I'll think it out and type it out with some links for you why did you drop web development uh I'll tell you why I dropped web development I took way too many credits I think I was taking 23 credit hours that semester which um I don't know how credit hours work in universities around the world but at least in the United States a normal fulltime schedule is considered it's 12 credit hours so I was almost double what they consider fulltime so that was a lot for me also um the teacher of that course had a really heavy accent and I had a hard time understanding him I'm usually pretty good with accents but I just had a hard time and what he was teaching I knew enough about web development at that point to realize what he was teaching was several years out of date and I just I didn't like that so I needed to drop a class anyway because it was too overwhelming so that was on the top of the list someone says they have dreams with me coding I'm the same way I'm definitely same way uh that's that's cool sometimes I actually dream up solutions that really work it doesn't happen all the time but it it does happen so I think it's cool all right someone I'm going to have to cut this off soon because uh I'm getting to the bottom of the live stream and then more you know I get more comments so uh I'm going to say this is the last last set you know whatever's on the screen here at the bottom this is the last set that I'm going to do and I'm going to have to cut it off uh someone says there are support analyst trying to transition out of support into development I have a b completed a bachelor's degree Oracle certified developed an Android app and no Dev experience how do I transition successfully um I would say build some side projects uh learn as much you can build some side projects or get some paid freelance work if you can uh you can also contribute to open source projects on GitHub and that'll build up your portfolio that's really all you need if you have a good portfolio that's what employers want to see the most at least employers that know what they're doing when they hire a developer uh the most important thing is can this person do the job and have they proven it by their previous projects that's what I would work on uh if I were you that's what I look for when when I'm looking at resumés to higher developers the most important thing to me is you know the experience just show me what you've built uh my Twitter somebody asked for my Twitter handle it's in the description of this video okay uh hi how to handle errors in the fetch response uh maybe we can go over that in a later video okay so I'm going to cut that off now because this video has gone super long and it's going to be intimidating for people who are going to want to rewatch it I'll have to make a note that the last half hour or so is all kind of question and answer session but thanks for all the engagement uh I think this is by far like the most active live chat that I've had in the video and I really like that and I like that so many of you have said you know you're you're finding this valuable and I really want your feedback so I'm pretty new to live streaming I'm sure I could be doing this you know a lot better so uh any advice you can give me put it in the comments direct message me on Twitter uh have a great weekend everybody I'll be back on Monday at 11 30 a.m. eastern time I'll schedule the uh the event before I leave today so so it'll be on the you know it be on the channel and you'll see it but it'll be a different time than normal so uh I I had a great time with you guys today hopefully this was helpful to you and I'll be back on Monday
