With timestamps:

00:00 - i will be talking about the current
00:01 - involvement for web development uh i
00:04 - will be talking about what text editor
00:06 - i'm using and what terminal and what
00:08 - shell i'm using
00:10 - um because i experienced in in many in
00:12 - many talks after the meet ups
00:15 - that people are constantly discussing
00:17 - what they are using and what would be
00:19 - good
00:20 - and the advantages and disadvantages of
00:22 - all the
00:23 - text editors
00:24 - so i just quickly going to show you my
00:27 - setup and afterwards we can have a
00:29 - collective discussion but what you are
00:32 - using and what's best
00:34 - so
00:35 - i'm using visual studio code and item
00:39 - you can see here is visual studio code
00:40 - and here is item
00:42 - how many of you are using visual studio
00:45 - code
00:46 - okay that's a lot um
00:48 - yeah so i i tried many
00:51 - many text editors i tried atom visual
00:53 - studio webstorm
00:56 - brackets and ultimately i ended up with
00:58 - visual studio code
01:00 - um
01:01 - yes i was really amazed when i was using
01:03 - visual studio that there is a thing like
01:06 - intellisense and for c-sharp development
01:09 - you have to use basically visual studio
01:12 - and so i tried visual studio code and
01:14 - i'm happy ever since
01:16 - and i'm also going to talk about item
01:18 - the terminal i use because the basic
01:20 - terminal is
01:21 - bash
01:23 - i think
01:24 - or it's called
01:25 - terminal
01:26 - something like this however
01:28 - um
01:29 - i will not spend much time here because
01:31 - i'm not using it that that often and
01:34 - also we just do the code comes with a
01:36 - terminal on its own
01:38 - um yes i think that's it another
01:42 - important information is that i'm using
01:44 - a mac macbook pro and
01:47 - yeah
01:49 - so the first thing i want to talk about
01:51 - is visual studio code
01:53 - and the features are displayed here
01:56 - if you click on the link here
01:59 - you should go to the home page
02:04 - which is not displayed doesn't matter
02:08 - we'll just copy it
02:11 - or we'll even
02:14 - i will even
02:17 - yeah
02:18 - we'll even just open it here
02:21 - and show you
02:28 - it should work right now yeah awesome
02:31 - so as i'm working on here
02:34 - i'm going for visual
02:37 - studio code
02:41 - no that's not so great here
02:44 - and here are the main features
02:47 - displayed first of all it has it has
02:50 - intellisense which is practically uh
02:52 - just syntax highlighting and also
02:55 - autocomplete i was very amazed when i
02:57 - encountered this uh
02:59 - feature it basically allows you to
03:02 - suggest you the methods of objects or
03:05 - functions whatever
03:07 - and i will afterwards show a short
03:10 - showcase on how to use it and then it
03:12 - will be
03:13 - clear and much easier to understand
03:16 - there's also debugging involved
03:18 - in visual studio code so you don't need
03:21 - to debug in chrome or whatever browser
03:24 - you're using
03:25 - you have also
03:27 - built in git comments and it's
03:30 - ultimately easy to extend
03:32 - extend
03:33 - but i think nowadays most of the editors
03:36 - are easy to extend
03:38 - i also
03:40 - created uh or even wrote an article
03:43 - about
03:44 - hmm about
03:47 - the visual studio code extensions i'm
03:49 - using
03:50 - and this is actually the article it
03:54 - has reached pretty much
03:56 - good success
03:58 - i've just
03:59 - listed all my extensions i'm using i'm
04:01 - using extensions for html like auto
04:03 - close tag
04:05 - rename tag html snippets markdown
04:08 - extensions of course javascript
04:11 - extensions
04:12 - this is very important debugger for
04:14 - chrome you can easily
04:16 - start debugging without a lot of
04:18 - configuration maybe i can show you that
04:20 - as well
04:22 - of course eslint linting checking your
04:24 - code
04:26 - yes
04:27 - in modules intellisense
04:29 - so if you're if you're interested just
04:31 - go to the article and
04:34 - check out the extensions they are pretty
04:36 - nice for developing
04:38 - yes
04:39 - that's the article about extensions
04:42 - and
04:44 - the next thing i want to show you is
04:45 - item
04:48 - is anyone using item
04:51 - okay one awesome
04:53 - then just a
04:54 - short and quick introduction to item
04:56 - just give you an overview
04:59 - just type in an item and it should be
05:01 - the first one it's a terminal especially
05:03 - for mac os and if i go to features you
05:06 - can see what what you can do with with
05:08 - item you can split panes
05:10 - you have hotkey windows
05:13 - you can search for stuff you can
05:15 - autocomplete
05:17 - and yeah so different features that
05:19 - makes the use of of a terminal very easy
05:23 - and efficient
05:26 - i never really
05:27 - used to use the integrated terminal of
05:30 - mac os
05:31 - i started using item right away because
05:33 - i was recommended to use it and i was
05:36 - always happy
05:38 - yes so that's the item part
05:40 - and if i go through the
05:44 - presentation i'm also using it with
05:48 - i think i will just put it in here
05:50 - because that's too complicated otherwise
05:53 - i also combine it with the chat shell is
05:55 - anyone else using the chat shell
05:58 - one nice
06:00 - i use it with the um or however it's
06:03 - called it has some nice uh teams and and
06:06 - features
06:08 - and also using the auto suggestions we
06:11 - just show you in in practice as well
06:14 - there's also a good article and i will
06:16 - show the slides afterwards so you can
06:18 - check that out as well
06:21 - since my setup here is a little bit
06:24 - weird
06:26 - i will go right away to the
06:28 - demonstration part
06:30 - created a nice
06:33 - a nice slide here
06:35 - yes so now i'm going to demonstrate how
06:38 - i'm using both visual studio code and
06:41 - the item
06:45 - just figuring out how to use it properly
06:48 - here
06:49 - i think the best thing is
06:51 - to just put it in there and
06:55 - looking on top
06:57 - so maybe another nice feature is to use
06:59 - spectacle is someone using that for mac
07:02 - os
07:03 - it's just that you can switch with your
07:06 - window
07:07 - it comes by default the most linux
07:09 - distribution probably yeah it comes on
07:11 - default but
07:13 - yeah but mac doesn't have has have
07:16 - something like this so spectacle on top
07:18 - the
07:20 - the glasses is a nice tool and that's
07:22 - for free and it's working great
07:24 - so as you can see here
07:26 - um
07:28 - i can't really stand on the side
07:31 - yeah
07:32 - as you can see here is that's the
07:34 - terminal i have used uh used a nice team
07:37 - with coloring and showing the git status
07:41 - and i'm currently at the developers
07:42 - rising repository
07:56 - you the allies
07:58 - allies
07:59 - yeah that comes
08:01 - out of the box
08:02 - and they are a lot especially a lot with
08:04 - git that's very useful this can be very
08:07 - useful
08:08 - you can see here
08:09 - and for example if i want to do
08:11 - something i can get status which is just
08:14 - just
08:15 - and it shows me
08:16 - my current status of git
08:19 - so what's also very nice and works well
08:21 - with which you study code is now when
08:24 - i'm typing or maybe let's have it like
08:26 - this if i'm typing
08:30 - yeah
08:31 - probably
08:35 - so so if i'm typing code dot there is
08:39 - i've installed it in the path i can just
08:41 - open visual studio code
08:43 - and now it opens of course in my
08:46 - other window but here it is
08:50 - and here i'm having the terminal on my
08:52 - side
08:53 - so i can always
08:55 - work with the terminal here on this side
08:57 - and can work with the editor on this
08:59 - side
09:00 - so
09:01 - what i wanted to demonstrate now is just
09:03 - to see how visual studio code works you
09:06 - have
09:07 - options here to
09:09 - show you the
09:11 - folders and files
09:14 - you have a search
09:15 - you have a known section for your git
09:18 - stuff
09:20 - you have a debugger mode and the
09:22 - extensions listed and it's also very
09:24 - easy to install uh install extensions
09:28 - you can just add them here
09:30 - and yeah activate them install them
09:33 - uninstall them
09:34 - etc uh what's interesting is also maybe
09:39 - it was a little bit bigger here
09:42 - no is it better no yeah
09:45 - you also have a console here
09:48 - you have a debug console you have a
09:50 - terminal
09:51 - and depending on what shell you have
09:53 - installed you can also use the comments
09:54 - here you see just
09:56 - work working fine
09:58 - and it's also if you have a linter or
10:00 - something else installed it displays all
10:03 - the problems and stuff that is not
10:05 - working
10:06 - so what i did here is as you know we
10:08 - have a home page where we uh
10:10 - for developers rising
10:12 - and i just added our
10:14 - new partner
10:16 - that is we accelerate um if a just and
10:20 - search everything is working easily we
10:22 - accelerate
10:25 - you can see i just put in a div here a
10:26 - diff class
10:29 - this section here and now
10:31 - one of the benefits with visual studio
10:33 - code is if you can you can simply
10:36 - click on the tab here
10:38 - just show me the working tree here and
10:40 - show me the difference and it's side by
10:42 - side showing you what you have added or
10:44 - changed
10:45 - and
10:46 - it's working perfectly on the side on
10:48 - the side here
10:50 - you even have a mark where the change in
10:52 - your file is so if you're if you're
10:55 - having a large file with thousand lines
10:59 - um then this really helps and in this
11:01 - case i quickly can see okay i have here
11:04 - added a div
11:06 - so now what i'm going to do is i use the
11:08 - terminal
11:09 - and
11:10 - i'm most of the time i'm using the
11:13 - terminal terminal to use git stuff
11:14 - because it's just faster so once again i
11:17 - use the check uh git status to check
11:19 - what i've
11:20 - what i've done
11:21 - now say okay i'm using also alias here
11:24 - and said okay
11:26 - are using a git commit
11:28 - with a message
11:30 - and i say just add new
11:33 - partner
11:35 - partner wii x blur rate
11:40 - accelerate is this type correctly yeah
11:42 - um
11:43 - or maybe with a double d
11:46 - you can also use it like oh holy
11:48 - what's that
11:54 - so now that it says uh still something
11:57 - missing okay i have a logo so just get
11:59 - at all
12:00 - very easy
12:02 - just
12:03 - and then i can ah what i also want to
12:05 - show you is the autocomplete
12:07 - i just go in with that and it shows me
12:10 - the last the last
12:12 - commit i did with with a type of message
12:15 - like that this so i use
12:18 - i just say add
12:20 - yeah a new partner's
12:22 - logo awesome
12:28 - i don't want to do that
12:30 - remove
12:34 - so this is not working what i'm doing
12:36 - now is just
12:37 - pressing ctrl c to get out of this
12:40 - whatever it that was
12:41 - i have no idea
12:44 - so i'm trying it again
12:46 - still just auto completing it
12:49 - what
12:50 - now it's working right no
12:52 - no
12:55 - you need to either oh true
12:57 - true true true awesome now it's working
13:00 - and now instead of get push i set the
13:02 - upstream already so just gp and now it
13:04 - pushes to the master branch and that's
13:07 - pretty easy what i also want to show you
13:11 - is
13:12 - now this one resolvers
13:14 - so it's it it's connected and
13:16 - knows that there is there are no changes
13:20 - and what i want to do or show you as
13:22 - well
13:23 - is to go to the help section
13:26 - and if you haven't worked with visual
13:27 - studio code you can easily just download
13:29 - it install it and then you can go to the
13:32 - hmm interactive playground that is what
13:36 - i wanted to show you
13:38 - and here actually i think this is
13:40 - amazing and i haven't seen this anywhere
13:41 - else
13:43 - it has an interactive playground where
13:45 - you can try to use the features so here
13:48 - is a interactive playground you can see
13:50 - the numbers here
13:52 - and you can simply do some
13:55 - as it is explained here you can combine
13:57 - different keys
13:59 - and for example add multiple cursors
14:04 - and write different stuff awesome
14:07 - but you can also
14:09 - maybe
14:11 - if i want to just switch lines or co or
14:15 - multiple
14:16 - multiply lines can also do that very
14:18 - easily i can switch them around
14:22 - that's very easy
14:24 - i also can do is i'm not quite sure if
14:25 - i've
14:26 - installed this
14:28 - yeah just on the line going down and
14:30 - adding i don't know what is this here
14:32 - oh no idea maybe i can add another
14:34 - comment
14:36 - hi
14:38 - that's it awesome i can also delete it
14:42 - cool
14:43 - so that's a great feature and it just
14:45 - goes through the stuff here
14:47 - what i want to show you is actually the
14:49 - intellisense which is amazing
14:52 - here is a basic express example
14:55 - and what intellisense allows you to do
14:58 - is if you type app now and then dot
15:02 - then it should
15:04 - suggest you
15:07 - things
15:08 - which it doesn't
15:12 - ah i'm not i
15:13 - it does but this is not optimized
15:16 - because that's the playground doesn't
15:17 - matter it it does what it should do um
15:20 - it just suggests you
15:23 - features
15:24 - and method
15:27 - that's not working really in the
15:28 - playground
15:30 - maybe i'm using it
15:32 - for more
15:34 - on top
15:39 - yeah
15:41 - yeah i don't think it's working
15:43 - like it should here
15:45 - doesn't matter
15:47 - you can try it on your own and it
15:49 - hopefully will
15:50 - uh work
15:52 - um yeah line action i'm talking about
15:54 - that
15:55 - refactoring so there is plenty of other
15:57 - stuff on how to
15:58 - speed up your coding
16:00 - and i think it's
16:02 - pretty good especially if you're
16:03 - starting with the free code cam
16:04 - curriculum you have the box where you
16:06 - write your code inside and at the
16:09 - beginning it is okay but when you later
16:11 - have to write longer code i think it's
16:14 - more and more important to have a good
16:16 - editor with
16:17 - syntax highlighting and also suggestions
16:20 - and what i've used in the curriculum
16:22 - when i was
16:23 - more advanced and working from the
16:25 - advanced algorithms i was always
16:27 - writing the stuff in inside the text
16:30 - editor like
16:32 - atom or visual studio code
16:34 - and
16:35 - i think it's just easier
16:37 - to work with it test it and
16:40 - see if you're working the algorithm the
16:42 - right way
16:43 - instead of using the
16:45 - field on the homepage
16:47 - yeah i think that's it um
16:50 - i think those are the most important
16:52 - things i just wanted to go through since
16:54 - the setup is really weird here for me
16:55 - i'm not going to demonstrate more
16:58 - um yes
17:00 - oh yeah i have an introduction or maybe
17:02 - i can close
17:05 - somewhere is the presentation yes here's
17:07 - the background credit
17:09 - for somewhere tella from unsplash
17:12 - yeah just about me a little bit um
17:15 - i'm co-organizing this meetup with rob
17:18 - with robert and
17:20 - i'm a business law student i'm working
17:23 - as a front-end developer currently and
17:25 - i'm focusing on machine learning and i
17:28 - also did
17:29 - if anyone is interested in machine
17:31 - learning i also did
17:33 - where is that
17:36 - or
17:37 - i even
17:38 - even wrote an article actually
17:40 - if i find that it would be nice
17:42 - yeah it's here
17:44 - so if you if you are
17:46 - whoa
17:47 - if you're trying to get into machine
17:48 - learning there's a great course online
17:50 - it's from kuzera cozero is also an
17:53 - online learning platform it has very it
17:55 - has a lot of different courses
17:59 - um
18:00 - i think also in css and javascript and
18:02 - stuff like that but i did the machine
18:04 - learning course and i also wrote tips
18:06 - and tricks on how to do it
18:08 - i think it takes three months or
18:09 - something and it's just amazing so i can
18:12 - also recommend to check
18:14 - especially this course because the
18:16 - teacher is amazing
18:18 - but also the platform called zera it's
18:20 - amazing
18:21 - yes this was my setup
18:23 - now we can discuss your setups or if you
18:25 - have any questions just feel free to ask
18:28 - thank you very much

Cleaned transcript:

i will be talking about the current involvement for web development uh i will be talking about what text editor i'm using and what terminal and what shell i'm using um because i experienced in in many in many talks after the meet ups that people are constantly discussing what they are using and what would be good and the advantages and disadvantages of all the text editors so i just quickly going to show you my setup and afterwards we can have a collective discussion but what you are using and what's best so i'm using visual studio code and item you can see here is visual studio code and here is item how many of you are using visual studio code okay that's a lot um yeah so i i tried many many text editors i tried atom visual studio webstorm brackets and ultimately i ended up with visual studio code um yes i was really amazed when i was using visual studio that there is a thing like intellisense and for csharp development you have to use basically visual studio and so i tried visual studio code and i'm happy ever since and i'm also going to talk about item the terminal i use because the basic terminal is bash i think or it's called terminal something like this however um i will not spend much time here because i'm not using it that that often and also we just do the code comes with a terminal on its own um yes i think that's it another important information is that i'm using a mac macbook pro and yeah so the first thing i want to talk about is visual studio code and the features are displayed here if you click on the link here you should go to the home page which is not displayed doesn't matter we'll just copy it or we'll even i will even yeah we'll even just open it here and show you it should work right now yeah awesome so as i'm working on here i'm going for visual studio code no that's not so great here and here are the main features displayed first of all it has it has intellisense which is practically uh just syntax highlighting and also autocomplete i was very amazed when i encountered this uh feature it basically allows you to suggest you the methods of objects or functions whatever and i will afterwards show a short showcase on how to use it and then it will be clear and much easier to understand there's also debugging involved in visual studio code so you don't need to debug in chrome or whatever browser you're using you have also built in git comments and it's ultimately easy to extend extend but i think nowadays most of the editors are easy to extend i also created uh or even wrote an article about hmm about the visual studio code extensions i'm using and this is actually the article it has reached pretty much good success i've just listed all my extensions i'm using i'm using extensions for html like auto close tag rename tag html snippets markdown extensions of course javascript extensions this is very important debugger for chrome you can easily start debugging without a lot of configuration maybe i can show you that as well of course eslint linting checking your code yes in modules intellisense so if you're if you're interested just go to the article and check out the extensions they are pretty nice for developing yes that's the article about extensions and the next thing i want to show you is item is anyone using item okay one awesome then just a short and quick introduction to item just give you an overview just type in an item and it should be the first one it's a terminal especially for mac os and if i go to features you can see what what you can do with with item you can split panes you have hotkey windows you can search for stuff you can autocomplete and yeah so different features that makes the use of of a terminal very easy and efficient i never really used to use the integrated terminal of mac os i started using item right away because i was recommended to use it and i was always happy yes so that's the item part and if i go through the presentation i'm also using it with i think i will just put it in here because that's too complicated otherwise i also combine it with the chat shell is anyone else using the chat shell one nice i use it with the um or however it's called it has some nice uh teams and and features and also using the auto suggestions we just show you in in practice as well there's also a good article and i will show the slides afterwards so you can check that out as well since my setup here is a little bit weird i will go right away to the demonstration part created a nice a nice slide here yes so now i'm going to demonstrate how i'm using both visual studio code and the item just figuring out how to use it properly here i think the best thing is to just put it in there and looking on top so maybe another nice feature is to use spectacle is someone using that for mac os it's just that you can switch with your window it comes by default the most linux distribution probably yeah it comes on default but yeah but mac doesn't have has have something like this so spectacle on top the the glasses is a nice tool and that's for free and it's working great so as you can see here um i can't really stand on the side yeah as you can see here is that's the terminal i have used uh used a nice team with coloring and showing the git status and i'm currently at the developers rising repository you the allies allies yeah that comes out of the box and they are a lot especially a lot with git that's very useful this can be very useful you can see here and for example if i want to do something i can get status which is just just and it shows me my current status of git so what's also very nice and works well with which you study code is now when i'm typing or maybe let's have it like this if i'm typing yeah probably so so if i'm typing code dot there is i've installed it in the path i can just open visual studio code and now it opens of course in my other window but here it is and here i'm having the terminal on my side so i can always work with the terminal here on this side and can work with the editor on this side so what i wanted to demonstrate now is just to see how visual studio code works you have options here to show you the folders and files you have a search you have a known section for your git stuff you have a debugger mode and the extensions listed and it's also very easy to install uh install extensions you can just add them here and yeah activate them install them uninstall them etc uh what's interesting is also maybe it was a little bit bigger here no is it better no yeah you also have a console here you have a debug console you have a terminal and depending on what shell you have installed you can also use the comments here you see just work working fine and it's also if you have a linter or something else installed it displays all the problems and stuff that is not working so what i did here is as you know we have a home page where we uh for developers rising and i just added our new partner that is we accelerate um if a just and search everything is working easily we accelerate you can see i just put in a div here a diff class this section here and now one of the benefits with visual studio code is if you can you can simply click on the tab here just show me the working tree here and show me the difference and it's side by side showing you what you have added or changed and it's working perfectly on the side on the side here you even have a mark where the change in your file is so if you're if you're having a large file with thousand lines um then this really helps and in this case i quickly can see okay i have here added a div so now what i'm going to do is i use the terminal and i'm most of the time i'm using the terminal terminal to use git stuff because it's just faster so once again i use the check uh git status to check what i've what i've done now say okay i'm using also alias here and said okay are using a git commit with a message and i say just add new partner partner wii x blur rate accelerate is this type correctly yeah um or maybe with a double d you can also use it like oh holy what's that so now that it says uh still something missing okay i have a logo so just get at all very easy just and then i can ah what i also want to show you is the autocomplete i just go in with that and it shows me the last the last commit i did with with a type of message like that this so i use i just say add yeah a new partner's logo awesome i don't want to do that remove so this is not working what i'm doing now is just pressing ctrl c to get out of this whatever it that was i have no idea so i'm trying it again still just auto completing it what now it's working right no no you need to either oh true true true true awesome now it's working and now instead of get push i set the upstream already so just gp and now it pushes to the master branch and that's pretty easy what i also want to show you is now this one resolvers so it's it it's connected and knows that there is there are no changes and what i want to do or show you as well is to go to the help section and if you haven't worked with visual studio code you can easily just download it install it and then you can go to the hmm interactive playground that is what i wanted to show you and here actually i think this is amazing and i haven't seen this anywhere else it has an interactive playground where you can try to use the features so here is a interactive playground you can see the numbers here and you can simply do some as it is explained here you can combine different keys and for example add multiple cursors and write different stuff awesome but you can also maybe if i want to just switch lines or co or multiple multiply lines can also do that very easily i can switch them around that's very easy i also can do is i'm not quite sure if i've installed this yeah just on the line going down and adding i don't know what is this here oh no idea maybe i can add another comment hi that's it awesome i can also delete it cool so that's a great feature and it just goes through the stuff here what i want to show you is actually the intellisense which is amazing here is a basic express example and what intellisense allows you to do is if you type app now and then dot then it should suggest you things which it doesn't ah i'm not i it does but this is not optimized because that's the playground doesn't matter it it does what it should do um it just suggests you features and method that's not working really in the playground maybe i'm using it for more on top yeah yeah i don't think it's working like it should here doesn't matter you can try it on your own and it hopefully will uh work um yeah line action i'm talking about that refactoring so there is plenty of other stuff on how to speed up your coding and i think it's pretty good especially if you're starting with the free code cam curriculum you have the box where you write your code inside and at the beginning it is okay but when you later have to write longer code i think it's more and more important to have a good editor with syntax highlighting and also suggestions and what i've used in the curriculum when i was more advanced and working from the advanced algorithms i was always writing the stuff in inside the text editor like atom or visual studio code and i think it's just easier to work with it test it and see if you're working the algorithm the right way instead of using the field on the homepage yeah i think that's it um i think those are the most important things i just wanted to go through since the setup is really weird here for me i'm not going to demonstrate more um yes oh yeah i have an introduction or maybe i can close somewhere is the presentation yes here's the background credit for somewhere tella from unsplash yeah just about me a little bit um i'm coorganizing this meetup with rob with robert and i'm a business law student i'm working as a frontend developer currently and i'm focusing on machine learning and i also did if anyone is interested in machine learning i also did where is that or i even even wrote an article actually if i find that it would be nice yeah it's here so if you if you are whoa if you're trying to get into machine learning there's a great course online it's from kuzera cozero is also an online learning platform it has very it has a lot of different courses um i think also in css and javascript and stuff like that but i did the machine learning course and i also wrote tips and tricks on how to do it i think it takes three months or something and it's just amazing so i can also recommend to check especially this course because the teacher is amazing but also the platform called zera it's amazing yes this was my setup now we can discuss your setups or if you have any questions just feel free to ask thank you very much
