00:07 - hey everybody is Jessie and today we're
00:12 - going to continue right where we left
00:14 - off yesterday so I had to work on some
00:17 - other stuff and I had to fix one problem
00:20 - with the project that we had worked on
00:23 - previously that had to do with the JW
00:26 - player video but I kind of fixed it was
00:32 - basically a workaround but I'm done with
00:36 - that and I'm ready to start on this
00:38 - project yesterday we made some decisions
00:41 - about it and we're going to use material
00:45 - UI
00:45 - as the framework and we use create react
00:48 - app to get everything started so today
00:51 - we're just going to go through and try
00:53 - to build our layout with material UI
00:55 - I've never used it before I'm familiar
00:57 - with material design but I'm not
00:59 - familiar with material UI specifically
01:02 - so this is kind of going to be a trial
01:05 - and error learning session today where
01:08 - you're just going to go through and see
01:10 - how things work if you're watching on
01:14 - Instagram this is the the view of me
01:19 - coding so if you want to see the code
01:21 - check it out on the free code camp
01:23 - youtube channel you can watch it live
01:27 - now or if you have seen the recording
01:29 - later on this will be the title of the
01:36 - video is react project day to learning
01:39 - material UI and that's on the live
01:41 - coding with Jessie playlist on the free
01:43 - code camp channel alright so let me get
01:48 - you take a look at the live chat say
01:51 - hello to everyone
01:55 - all right hey everyone cool let's see
01:59 - some familiar faces and some new people
02:01 - so if you're new welcome and don't be
02:06 - afraid to ask questions give advice
02:09 - definitely open to to
02:12 - that if you are new this is not really a
02:15 - tutorial this is just me doing my
02:17 - everyday work so there are going to be
02:19 - mistakes it's not rehearsed beforehand
02:25 - so I guess that's it can be good at
02:29 - times because we try to work through the
02:31 - mistake so eventually we usually figure
02:33 - out the right way to do things
02:37 - let me know yesterday we had some issues
02:40 - where my phone was giving interference
02:43 - with my microphone so let me know if
02:45 - that happens again and I can move it so
02:47 - right now I'm trying to manage the phone
02:51 - streaming at the same time as the
02:53 - YouTube streaming so if it's too much I
02:58 - can just cut the the phone stream I
03:01 - don't have nearly as many people watch
03:03 - the phone stream alright so just go in
03:08 - the live chat real quick see everyone
03:15 - wow the tailor says it's it's night time
03:19 - it's to 2:00 a.m. Wow Taylor where you
03:23 - at right now that it's 2:00 a.m. already
03:29 - Alessandra put the little parenthesis
03:33 - and the the fire looks like the free
03:35 - code camp logos that's really cool let's
03:39 - see white white lightning says hey
03:44 - Jessie big fan of material design some
03:46 - interesting how you tackle material UI
03:48 - cool yeah i'm i really like material
03:50 - design as well so I'm really hoping
03:53 - material UI turns out to be awesome
03:56 - because I'd love to use it
04:03 - let's see okay I think we can get
04:07 - started
04:08 - Oh Sean says Jessie I've had some
04:12 - problems with the previous react project
04:15 - okay let me know uh oh Sean send me a
04:17 - message on Twitter and let me know what
04:21 - issues you're having or you can open up
04:23 - an issue on the github repo for that
04:26 - project so I'd like to know what's going
04:28 - on with that and see if we can get those
04:34 - problems fixed Evo says 8 p.m. here in
04:37 - the Netherlands so perfect time for live
04:39 - stream cool that's cool I always I don't
04:42 - really worry that much about what time I
04:44 - stream because people are watching from
04:45 - everywhere so it doesn't really matter
04:48 - what time I stream it's gonna be you
04:51 - know a different time for everyone so it
04:54 - would be cool to do it maybe some
04:56 - morning streams my time just to give
04:58 - people a chance to watch it who maybe
05:00 - can never watch it 11:30 p.m. in India
05:06 - Alan from Michigan seer hey how's it
05:08 - going
05:11 - I have heard of react MD I have not used
05:16 - it the Kevin says how are you not bad
05:22 - I'm pretty tired got up really early
05:25 - with the baby this morning so definitely
05:30 - running on some caffeine I had a double
05:33 - espresso this morning and right now I'm
05:36 - drinking some G fuel it's like an energy
05:39 - drink so hopefully I can do a good job
05:47 - in this stream I usually get pretty
05:51 - pumped up when I'm doing the stream and
05:52 - I don't feel quite as tired unless it's
05:54 - like a three hour stream then I start to
05:56 - feel it alright so I'm gonna get started
06:01 - I'll come back periodically and check
06:04 - out the live shot and try to answer the
06:06 - questions I've been having a lot of
06:08 - people ask a lot of questions in the
06:10 - live chat so let me know what you all
06:12 - think but I've been thinking about maybe
06:14 - have
06:14 - some sort of moderator in the chat not
06:17 - really to like tell people what to do
06:19 - but just to keep track of when people
06:22 - ask questions so there's some questions
06:24 - that I probably don't need to answer
06:25 - like when people ask about like what
06:28 - what editor I'm using or what the theme
06:31 - is things like that there are basic
06:33 - questions or when people come in and say
06:35 - like hey what are you working on which
06:37 - those are valid questions especially if
06:39 - you knew but everybody else in the live
06:43 - chat could could answer those just as
06:44 - well as I could so those kind of
06:47 - questions would be cool to have the
06:50 - moderator basically categorized the
06:53 - questions between ones that have a
06:55 - simple answer that could just be handled
06:57 - in live chat and the ones that I
06:58 - probably should answer and then you know
07:02 - when it's time for me to go back to the
07:04 - live chat to answer questions then I
07:06 - would I'd be able to see those somehow
07:08 - so I'm not sure exactly how it'll work
07:10 - out maybe there's already something
07:12 - developed to handle stuff like that and
07:14 - if you all know about a good way to
07:17 - handle that let me know and if anybody's
07:19 - interested in kind of being a moderator
07:22 - let me know as well I would just say if
07:25 - you are going to be a moderator make
07:26 - sure you're somebody who doesn't have a
07:27 - bad temper and is very patient because I
07:31 - like to keep everything really positive
07:33 - no matter what people are saying so I
07:37 - don't want anybody getting upset at the
07:40 - the people in the live chat
07:42 - I don't consider any question to be you
07:46 - know like too much of a noob question or
07:48 - anything so anyway so I'm gonna give it
07:52 - some thought and if you all want to give
07:54 - some thought and let me know you know
07:55 - maybe I'll do that we'll see yesterday
07:58 - was a crazy day we had just a lot of
08:00 - people in the chat today is still above
08:03 - average but not quite as crazy so maybe
08:06 - I won't need it we'll see for right now
08:13 - I'm gonna start up my Pomodoro timer and
08:17 - try to you get into our first coding
08:20 - session oh one more thing this is not an
08:24 - endorsement just just a helpful
08:28 - fYI Udacity is having I think like a 50%
08:32 - off sale right now in their courses so
08:34 - if you were thinking about doing a
08:36 - course from Udacity now would probably
08:39 - be a good time to sign up because there
08:43 - you know that's a pretty big discount
08:45 - for their courses so unfortunately I
08:47 - already signed up for my course about a
08:52 - month ago so I won't get the discount
08:57 - but I know I think some of you in the
09:01 - chat had mentioned that you're
09:02 - interested in doing some of the courses
09:04 - like the react course or anything so
09:06 - it's a good deal right now alright so as
09:09 - you can see I didn't do literally I did
09:11 - nothing with this project since
09:12 - yesterday I didn't even have time to set
09:14 - this up so I don't even have a link to
09:16 - this yet because right now there's
09:17 - nothing in there
09:20 - so I'm not I'm not gonna worry about the
09:23 - Trello board I'll kind of have to like
09:25 - go back and fill in what we've done I am
09:28 - keeping track of the the time that I've
09:31 - put into this on a separate spreadsheet
09:33 - on my other screen so I'm gonna know how
09:36 - much time I put into things I'll just
09:38 - have to fill out the Trello board later
09:40 - on alright so let's get our code up here
09:47 - let me get things organized how we
09:49 - probably normally have it let's see I
09:55 - think I probably want to do kind of a
10:01 - side by side to minimize that and
10:09 - I yeah this should work I probably don't
10:17 - need to see places right now we can get
10:24 - rid of that and let's get rid of this
10:27 - side there we go that'll give us plenty
10:32 - of space
10:33 - increase the font a bit let me know if
10:36 - that font is too small and I probably
10:39 - won't look at the chat for a little
10:40 - while but if I see it all I'll make it a
10:43 - bit bigger okay so one thing I noticed
10:47 - yesterday but I didn't do anything about
10:48 - is that this doesn't do anything and it
10:52 - seems like it should right so let's I'm
11:00 - gonna see what's going on here I think
11:03 - this is probably one of those things
11:05 - where that that kind of extra click
11:08 - thing that we had talked about yesterday
11:11 - see I don't need that let's go to the
11:16 - setup and see what they were saying
11:18 - about okay so this tap event plug-in
11:29 - this is probably what we need to make
11:32 - that work so let's bring that in
11:40 - well these semicolons are freaking me
11:43 - out a little bit on the last project I
11:45 - got used to not using the semicolons and
11:47 - now they're there and I can't take it
11:49 - they just look I'm just gonna take them
11:51 - out right now it's been really bothering
11:55 - that I do we get them all no one more
12:01 - all right cool
12:03 - no semicolons I think at some point
12:08 - we're gonna have to eject create react
12:10 - app and do some X some stuff with it
12:14 - because I'd love to have the automatic
12:16 - formatting like we had when our with our
12:18 - other project alright so is this I just
12:27 - want to see if I have to actually
12:28 - install this if it comes with
12:38 - it looks like I have to install it so I
12:40 - mean it's worth a shot
12:41 - to see if it comes with it first but and
12:45 - it's
12:54 - hmm
13:07 - so I'm wondering it at least this is not
13:11 - really descriptive in terms of what I to
13:15 - put this inside of component didn't
13:17 - mounts I mean would that be maybe I'll
13:21 - look at these docks might be a bit
13:24 - better
13:25 - oh okay so we're saying just initialize
13:27 - it right there okay
13:31 - all right let's try it out like I said I
13:33 - might have to install this it didn't say
13:35 - on these instructions so there's I guess
13:38 - the possibility that it'll just work
13:42 - didn't start up my server so let me
13:46 - start up my dev server in the console
13:49 - here let's see where am I
14:04 - it's just going to use yarn start I did
14:07 - see somebody left a comment in the video
14:08 - yesterday about like the latest version
14:13 - of NPM is actually just as fast as yarn
14:15 - and it has like the same a similar lock
14:18 - file so Wow the the error page looks way
14:24 - different for create react app than it
14:25 - did for for next that's that's crazy but
14:31 - anyway for this project at least I'm
14:34 - gonna stick with yarn since I've already
14:35 - I'm already using it but I'll have to
14:37 - look into that and maybe in future
14:39 - projects I'll I'll just use the newest
14:41 - version of NPM I just I just saw I just
14:48 - happened to look over quickly to live
14:50 - chat and I saw white lightnings comment
14:52 - about his question his or her question
14:56 - sorry about why not use semicolons
15:02 - basically I did use semicolons and then
15:06 - on the last project everyone watching
15:09 - the stream kind of convinced me not to
15:10 - use them and we had like some Auto
15:13 - formatting going on with we're using
15:15 - prettier for that and it automatically
15:18 - removed semicolons so I just got used to
15:20 - it and now that I got used to it I don't
15:23 - want to go back it's really nice to not
15:25 - have to type out that semicolon it seems
15:27 - to me that if there's not really a
15:29 - difference between semicolons and not
15:31 - semicolons then the easier route is
15:34 - better and easier route being just not
15:36 - at a semicolon so I mean that works for
15:41 - me I don't really care if anybody else
15:43 - use semicolons it's not it doesn't
15:45 - bother me if they use semicolons but at
15:48 - least for my projects I think I'm gonna
15:49 - not use semicolons
15:52 - anymore so boys that I just want to see
15:58 - all right so tap event plug-in
16:06 - so this should be what we need let's go
16:10 - to our console where do you go now I
16:14 - moved it to the side sorry yeah this is
16:20 - it okay
16:22 - yarn add actually let me make this
16:25 - bigger
16:26 - I made this smaller earlier just to give
16:28 - me more space to work with there we go
16:31 - so we're gonna add that tap event
16:33 - plug-in and hopefully everything works
16:39 - okay there we go
16:50 - all right let's try to restart
17:04 - there we go and okay well still nothing
17:09 - happens we probably needed to install
17:11 - that anyway so I'm not really worried
17:13 - about that but I do want to see why I
17:19 - think I was going down the wrong path
17:21 - here in terms of trying to find this out
17:24 - so it looks like it wasn't the type of M
17:27 - plug-in I think this is the code that we
17:29 - use let's see what is going on
17:42 - I need I'm assuming that this is
17:47 - basically also you know the same
17:50 - component here so obvious obviously it's
17:53 - working there yeah this is a react site
18:01 - let's just see how they did it I'm gonna
18:07 - check the live chat here in a second too
18:08 - because I'm sure that some of you are
18:11 - thinking Jessie what are you doing
18:15 - here's the simple answer that often
18:18 - happens you are usually ahead of the
18:21 - game or at least ahead of me alright so
18:25 - let's see
18:34 - what was that who's the name of that app
18:38 - bar
18:53 - here we go
18:59 - it's odd
19:09 - it's just not really a nap board
19:11 - component oh well maybe maybe mine
19:17 - doesn't even have a nap bar component
19:32 - oh yeah so it looks like maybe it's a
19:39 - different version for that I don't know
19:41 - so there's a huge difference I guess
19:45 - between what's going on with the you
19:49 - know between my site and this site so
19:52 - I'm probably not going to be able to use
19:53 - that for an example so let me check out
19:57 - the the live chat here
20:07 - alright let's see I'll screw up a bit
20:12 - just to see
20:32 - okay so it looks like you do not add an
20:37 - event for left button and app bar so if
20:39 - you click it nothing at okay so I have
20:41 - to add oh it's actually have to add the
20:45 - event okay cool good to know thanks
20:50 - Sebastian and tour I I'm not sure how
20:54 - would you pronounce that it's it looks
20:56 - like it's t o re so let me know how you
21:00 - want me to pronounce that okay you must
21:06 - add props to the phone okay cool let's
21:10 - check out I'm gonna move this I guess I
21:16 - don't need to move this over right now I
21:18 - don't need to see it so let's check out
21:21 - what props there we go I feel a little
21:28 - bit silly now if I would have just
21:30 - scroll down and read all this I would
21:31 - have known sometimes it's just more fun
21:35 - to just try it and see what happens
21:38 - especially if I'm doing a stream like I
21:41 - don't want to spend the whole time
21:42 - reading that would be boring alright so
21:47 - callback function every touch so alright
21:52 - cool so I do need to add let's add this
21:55 - drawer area
22:02 - cool
22:09 - how do I get out of the drawer okay so
22:17 - [Music]
22:19 - let's put in a drawer and import all
22:30 - these
22:52 - all right so I'm not gonna include the
22:55 - button sexually I probably don't need
22:57 - this button because I want to make my my
23:00 - icon the drawer so I just need this
23:03 - drawer and I guess I'll put this oops
23:20 - just put this right below the app at bar
23:23 - and we'll leave it to state open for now
23:26 - just to see it make sure it's working
23:28 - and let's see all right I'm not gonna
23:42 - worry about this for now I just want to
23:44 - see if it works
23:48 - oops gonna be property open oh yeah
23:52 - let's see of course I have to put state
23:58 - in
24:06 - and let's leave it open okay cool
24:15 - nice and all right so now let's go back
24:26 - to our yeah let's go back to our app bar
24:36 - and let's see on left icon I'm gonna add
24:48 - this
24:56 - this weird per second I kept clicking
24:59 - and it wasn't doing anything it was odd
25:01 - so we're gonna want
25:14 - for now just something simple so let's
25:18 - say
25:28 - I'll just copy what they have here save
25:31 - some typing
25:47 - okay thanks Patrick Pat Patrick just
25:51 - paste it in the live chat exactly what
25:53 - what I need to do here so cool
26:10 - okay
26:18 - I see oops what's going on here I expect
26:25 - it's okay
26:31 - only this
26:41 - whoa what is this what did I do
27:00 - all right whatever happened there it
27:02 - didn't happen again so I'm cool with
27:04 - that
27:07 - okay No
27:13 - okay thanks I forgot this
27:21 - yeah all right cool it's always the
27:28 - worst awesome okay it seems like that's
27:34 - the hardest part when I do live streams
27:36 - is you just forget syntax that you type
27:38 - all the time but for some reason when
27:41 - it's live your mind just blanks so I
27:46 - really appreciate it when you all catch
27:47 - that and uh and let me know what the
27:51 - syntax is it saves me having to look it
27:52 - up which I'm fine with going but it does
27:55 - keep the stream moving along faster when
27:58 - you all help me out like that so I
27:59 - really do appreciate it okay so we need
28:13 - the desired behavior is that if you
28:20 - click outside of this it will close so
28:22 - let's let's check on that so I'll
28:28 - probably need to go back into the drawer
28:35 - component and let's see
28:44 - this has got to be any I mean this is
28:47 - pretty basic functionality so
29:22 - okay I think I probably forgot to add
29:26 - something mmm no I guess I didn't
29:46 - all right this is the one I want I want
29:52 - to say
30:13 - so I'm trying to figure out which which
30:19 - part
30:24 - which part of this is actually making it
30:29 - is it the undocked part let's see what
30:32 - on doctors dot okay so it just brings up
30:39 - the overlay so that makes sense
30:50 - hmm that not all right so I'm not seeing
30:57 - the overlay now what did I do
31:20 - okay I did not put this in there which
31:23 - maybe that's what's messing things up No
31:35 - all right I'm gonna look at the live
31:37 - chat
31:49 - oh man you guys saw it Sebastian I see
31:59 - Sebastian saw it for sure
32:00 - I added the this these two props I had
32:11 - it on the wrong component so I did have
32:19 - open what am I thinking
32:36 - okay so now this will make a lot more
32:40 - sense to me hopefully this is what I
32:53 - need
33:12 - yeah okay it works cool alright my timer
33:17 - is up so I'm gonna take a short break to
33:21 - go to the live chat and check up on what
33:24 - I missed answer some questions I'm
33:27 - preparing myself mentally now to see all
33:29 - of you telling me what I was doing wrong
33:33 - since I just made a series of silly
33:37 - mistakes alright so let me scroll up a
33:47 - bit
33:48 - no I got 82 viewers now that's that's
33:50 - nice it's um it's definitely over what
33:53 - we normally average so probably a lot of
33:56 - new people and I'm guessing so welcome
33:58 - thanks for watching and so I'm scrolling
34:02 - almost all the way back up to the top
34:16 - Carl says hey Jesse or anyone after
34:21 - completing the JavaScript section on
34:23 - free code camp is it safe to try and
34:25 - jump into react or is there more to do
34:28 - I'd say go ahead and jump into reacts I
34:31 - I don't think there's anything wrong
34:33 - with you know trying it out if it seems
34:37 - like it's too difficult then maybe you
34:39 - know go to something else and come back
34:41 - to it later on but you don't have to be
34:45 - a JavaScript master to know react and
34:47 - you'll get better at JavaScript as you
34:49 - do react because you'll find yourself
34:51 - using parts of JavaScript that you maybe
34:54 - didn't use before that was my experience
35:01 - all right we got people from someone
35:04 - from the Ivory Coast Ukraine oh man
35:10 - Philip says I'm feeling you there my son
35:12 - got up at 5:00 a.m. this morning can't
35:14 - wait until he is a teen I don't think
35:17 - I've ever heard anyone say can't wait
35:19 - till he's a teen usually people hey
35:23 - Dredd the teenagers but yeah I suppose
35:27 - teenagers will probably sleep in so I
35:31 - guess that's something to look forward
35:33 - to I'll finally get better sleep with my
35:38 - kids get bigger
35:45 - now it's Steven as says Steven says I'd
35:50 - love to see a black screen with green
35:52 - font much easier for an old guy to watch
35:54 - I could say if if you all have a really
36:03 - cool theme you'd like to suggest to me
36:05 - put it in the comments for this video or
36:10 - you can message me on Twitter but I'm
36:13 - using Adam as my code editor so if you
36:15 - do have a theme for that that you want
36:16 - to suggest I'll try it out if I if I
36:19 - like it then you know maybe I'll do that
36:22 - for the streams I don't think I've
36:25 - changed my theme for years are the same
36:28 - same theme so it might be cool to change
36:32 - it up all right let's see
36:42 - alright looks like some of you you're
36:45 - saying that I could use a bot to help
36:49 - moderate the chat that would be cool
36:53 - hey Phillip votes for Patrick to be the
36:56 - moderator hi from Down Under
36:59 - oh cool so Jack does that mean you're
37:01 - from Australia because that's cool if
37:03 - you are from Australia because I've
37:05 - never had anyone in the live chat say
37:07 - that they were from Australia and that's
37:10 - the only like the only continent other
37:13 - than of course Antarctica that I haven't
37:15 - had somebody say that they're from so
37:18 - that's really awesome now I can honestly
37:19 - tell people that I've had people from
37:22 - all the habitated continents okay
37:32 - Stephen said the udacity sail is
37:35 - actually more than 50% off that's
37:38 - awesome
37:41 - also since we're talking about sails
37:45 - Nordstrom has has sales going on right
37:47 - now if you need some clothes I needed a
37:50 - new pair of black dress shoes so I
37:52 - bought a pair on my lunch break
38:02 - also anytime I talk about a product or
38:05 - anything I don't officially endorse or
38:08 - get paid to talk about anything so this
38:10 - is all my honest opinion
38:29 - Stephen says yeah use prettier atom
38:32 - package oh yeah I haven't thought about
38:34 - that just using the atom package before
38:37 - I it was like a like a commit hook to
38:40 - where every time I committed it would
38:42 - change everything
38:43 - use standard J s as well for linting but
38:50 - I hadn't even thought of just doing it
38:52 - in atom I can't would like to have it as
38:55 - part of like the commit hook so that if
38:57 - people want to do a pull request
38:59 - everything is the same but I guess until
39:04 - I checked actually I'm not sure is it do
39:09 - I need that's probably a good question
39:11 - let me check this out
39:14 - do I even need to eject create react app
39:19 - in order to set that up I thought I did
39:23 - but now but I'm thinking about it I
39:24 - don't I really don't think I will
39:27 - because I don't really need to change
39:29 - anything with with like web pack so I
39:35 - think I could just do it so maybe I'll
39:38 - try not right now but at some point
39:43 - maybe I'll try to just bring over a lot
39:45 - of the stuff we use for the last project
39:47 - for linting and like formatting and try
39:50 - to use it here all right so my
39:57 - five-minute timer is up for the chat so
40:00 - I'm gonna just kind of go through really
40:04 - really quickly and see if there's
40:11 - anything super important that I I should
40:15 - address before I go on
40:28 - okay so see there are some questions
40:30 - I'll try to come back to the questions a
40:32 - little bit later Wow 2:15 a.m. and China
40:40 - looks like Sierra from 2:15 a.m. and
40:44 - China Wow so thanks for staying up so
40:47 - late and watching
41:07 - Thailand South Way says seeing this is
41:09 - awesome I'm currently making my tribute
41:11 - page keep up the good work that's cool
41:14 - send me send me a message on Twitter I
41:17 - want to see the the tribute page when
41:19 - when you're done with it that would be
41:21 - cool so if you don't mind I'd like to
41:23 - check that out
41:28 - Ricardo from Brazil says your live
41:33 - streams are great awesome thank you -
41:40 - best of hardstyle from Portugal
41:42 - I enjoy some some hardstyle occasionally
41:49 - ok cool
41:50 - let's get back to work if by the way if
41:55 - you ask a question in the chat and
41:57 - you're not able to stick around until I
41:59 - go through it later on you can just send
42:01 - it to me on Twitter or put it in the
42:04 - comments for this video and then I will
42:07 - get to it later on when I can because I
42:12 - realize yeah sometimes the streams go
42:15 - really long so it might be an hour or
42:17 - more before I get to your question so
42:18 - it's not really reasonable to expect
42:21 - that everyone can stick it out through
42:22 - the entire stream all right so let's
42:28 - let's see what were you doing ok we're
42:30 - setting this up so we've got our sidebar
42:33 - here which is awesome and does anybody
42:37 - else do this when you make something
42:38 - that's interactive like this you just
42:40 - click it a million times I don't know
42:44 - I've done that I've had clients say that
42:46 - they do that too and when they test the
42:48 - site it's just like satisfying somehow
42:53 - alright so that's not bad right now for
42:58 - the layout let's put in a footer because
43:03 - that'll be a standard layout for every
43:05 - view is going to have the
43:07 - have the sidebar and a footer so let's
43:10 - check out what we have to work with here
43:12 - with the footer do we have a footer
43:29 - okay maybe maybe no maybe we don't okay
43:34 - so there's a potentially maybe there's a
43:37 - footer there's hope cuz there's a footer
43:38 - for this site am I just missing it
43:55 - with stepper I'm not used to this
43:58 - terminology this is definitely different
43:59 - than materialized okay that's cool
44:06 - alright don't really need it for
44:08 - anything right now but it's good to know
44:20 - it's cool ah
44:34 - okay so it looks like there's not maybe
44:37 - I'm just not seeing it but looks like
44:39 - there's not really a component for for a
44:43 - footer I mean the closest thing I'm
44:46 - seeing is bottom nav so I mean the
44:54 - bottom nav would at least have the
44:56 - behavior that I want of being an element
45:00 - on the page that would always stay at
45:02 - the bottom so maybe maybe I can try
45:09 - putting this in and then just editing it
45:12 - maybe I could start with this and then
45:14 - edit it to look more like I would want
45:18 - to footer to look like I mean really I
45:20 - don't I don't absolutely need a footer
45:24 - but it would make it more consistent
45:27 - with all the other sites that I do for
45:30 - the University if I have a standard
45:31 - footer
45:41 - let's see all right so let's just let's
45:45 - put in the bottom half I don't really
45:48 - care about having these icons right now
45:50 - cuz I'm not gonna use them I just need
45:57 - actually I'm not even sure if I want to
45:59 - give it a death
47:00 - I'm gonna see maybe this will work if I
47:02 - get rid of these icons nope let's get
47:11 - rid of these
47:21 - let's put something in here
47:35 - mm-hmm
47:45 - oh there we go and you can see that all
47:49 - right that's definitely not the behavior
47:52 - that I want I must be missing something
47:56 - let me check the chat really quick and
47:57 - see
48:13 - Rohan hey Rohan how's it going
48:17 - you haven't really missed that much we
48:20 - just got our like side navigation drawer
48:22 - working basically you missed me like
48:26 - making silly mistakes for about a half
48:28 - an hour it looks like some we have in
48:36 - the live chat some people talking about
48:39 - like what they're doing with free code
48:41 - camp so we have a few people working on
48:43 - the tribute page and the portfolio page
48:46 - and everything so that's really cool
48:50 - I saw someone said the tribute page
48:53 - should be so Zanna says the tribute page
48:55 - should be simple yeah that's just to
48:57 - give some quick advice on that you know
49:00 - with those early projects and free code
49:02 - camp don't worry about trying to get
49:04 - them perfect right away you know just do
49:06 - the make sure that you complete the user
49:09 - you know stories and then move on you'll
49:12 - learn a lot more and you can always come
49:15 - back later and make them better how you
49:18 - want and in the portfolio I'm I actually
49:22 - never completed the portfolio part
49:24 - because I always I always wanted a
49:26 - better portfolio so I always thought
49:28 - well wait and do some cool stuff and
49:30 - then I'll add it in and I never went
49:31 - back in and added it in at least not yet
49:34 - okay all right so I don't see anyone in
49:39 - the lodge chat talking about this but I
49:42 - needed to maybe look at this
49:44 - documentation because at least in the
49:47 - materialized framework you know there
49:50 - was definitely a certain structure that
49:52 - you followed and it made sure that you
49:55 - know the footer stayed at the bottom
49:57 - even if you didn't have any content you
49:59 - know things like that so I'm thinking
50:00 - maybe I'm missing something
50:02 - some wrapper component or something that
50:04 - I should be using here so let me see if
50:09 - there's like something that talks about
50:12 - the layout themes those color
50:17 - I guess I'll start
50:31 - I guess I'm gonna check out one of the
50:33 - examples and I'm also gonna look here
50:40 - okay I can change the theme that's
50:44 - pretty cool
50:58 - okay very cool can customize the colors
51:01 - and everything that's actually awesome
51:04 - I'll probably end up making a standard
51:06 - theme with the university colors then
51:09 - and then I can just reuse that for
51:11 - future projects
51:24 - they're cool
51:32 - all right cool so everything's in inline
51:34 - style
51:52 - okay I'm not definitely not gonna use
51:54 - the built-in color stuff to use the
51:56 - university colors okay
52:01 - so didn't really find the no I didn't
52:06 - actually want webpack I wanted to the
52:08 - example I didn't actually find the info
52:12 - I wanted within this so let's see
52:26 - just wanna see how how they're doing
52:33 - things
53:14 - okay yeah I'm not maybe I'm missing
53:16 - something y'all can fill me in I'm not
53:19 - seeing anything like really special one
53:24 - on there
53:45 - okay
53:57 - okay I see Christian said in the live
54:00 - chat a footer is not part of the
54:01 - material design guidelines that makes
54:03 - sense
54:18 - yeah make sense Sebastian I see your
54:21 - your comment there it says there is no
54:23 - footer in material you I but the
54:24 - material I materialized CSS one is just
54:26 - a grid yeah I'm not I'm not necessarily
54:31 - worried about creating my own footer
54:33 - component what I what I was hoping would
54:37 - be kind of already made is making sure
54:41 - that it stays at the bottom so I just
54:46 - didn't want to have to like do that CSS
54:51 - on my own if I didn't have to but it
54:54 - looks like I will have to which is not
54:55 - really a big deal so what all I have to
54:59 - do is just make guess I make a footer
55:03 - component I don't know at this point
55:06 - maybe I should just move on to something
55:08 - else because I don't I don't absolutely
55:12 - need a footer component I just like to
55:14 - have it but if I were categorizing like
55:15 - what's essential to this project the
55:17 - footer is definitely way down on the
55:19 - list and it's not essential at all so
55:22 - maybe we'll just skip over that and then
55:24 - that'll give me some time to check out
55:27 - how I'm doing that on my other sites
55:28 - that use materialized and I'll probably
55:30 - just take the mark-up materialized users
55:32 - and convert that to a component and I'll
55:36 - put all the Styles you know right inside
55:38 - the component that's actually not a bad
55:40 - idea anytime something I'm used to using
55:43 - and materialize it's not here I'll just
55:45 - convert that into a component and
55:48 - eventually I'll end up with kind of a
55:50 - hybrid set of components that that can
55:55 - be used for future projects all right so
55:59 - now since I'm not gonna worry about a
56:06 - footer I'm gonna remove let's see the
56:09 - bottom nav
56:12 - and I'm gonna remove move it from here
56:16 - as well and so now we have this we can
56:23 - start to kind of populate how how we
56:27 - want this to look let's uh let's change
56:29 - some of the colors right away just to
56:33 - get that out of the way so since it was
56:36 - looking at this themes let's see I think
56:41 - this is where I've seen it at
57:06 - all right yes I definitely want to
57:07 - override I'm not I'm not gonna use any
57:11 - of these colors
57:40 - this might be a little bit more
57:42 - complicated than I thought I'd assume
57:45 - that it there would be an easier way
57:49 - maybe maybe there is mmmm
57:51 - overthinking this so probably what I
57:59 - could do then is
58:09 - here instead of putting having this
58:12 - variable for the color I can just change
58:15 - the color
58:15 - I just basically put put a hex color if
58:19 - I wanted to or I could you know import
58:23 - colors which may be more properly
58:40 - can you only hear that in the background
58:59 - yeah so my my boss came back from his
59:03 - honeymoon and he has like a minion toy
59:09 - so if you remember what was it was the
59:11 - movie I can't remember what the movie is
59:15 - now you know what I'm talk about there's
59:17 - a movie with Steve Carell did the voice
59:20 - for it
59:21 - Despicable Me that's it so the movie
59:24 - Despicable Me had minions in it and
59:26 - there's like several of the movies and
59:28 - then they did a separate movie for the
59:30 - minions he has this little toy that's a
59:33 - minion that like dances and sings so he
59:37 - just got back yesterday and he's like I
59:42 - keep hearing this it keeps playing it so
59:46 - anyway it looks like I only have a few
59:49 - seconds left on the live stream for
59:51 - Instagram so you can check out the
59:54 - recording if you want I don't even think
59:57 - anybody's watching right now so yeah but
60:02 - if you cared that noise in the
60:03 - background that's what it is it's that's
60:05 - that's hoyes so he even before I got the
60:08 - job here he was I don't know how it
60:10 - started but he had minion decorations
60:12 - and stuff and occasionally would call
60:15 - his workers his minions all over for fun
60:21 - okay
60:28 - I guess I could do this if I go in and
60:31 - edit this color CAS file I'm thinking do
60:39 - I really want to edit it or should I
60:40 - just make another file my only hesitate
60:48 - to edit things directly because what if
60:51 - I want to update later on you know they
60:54 - come up with a new version if I want to
60:56 - just try to pull that in and update it
61:01 - what I guess looking for is a way to do
61:04 - like a sub theme that would remain and
61:07 - still work even if I updated the main
61:09 - the main theme if anybody knows how I
61:12 - could do that please let me know if I
61:18 - can't it's not a big deal
61:30 - let's see I guess I could just look it
61:33 - up
61:41 - hey there we go stackoverflow has how to
61:45 - do how to apply a custom theme in
61:48 - material UI all right so all right so
61:58 - this person on Stack Overflow wrote a
62:00 - custom theme in a separate file okay
62:32 - all right so it seems like I could do it
62:35 - in a separate file and that would work
63:02 - okay
63:08 - I guess we can try that any other any
63:14 - other thoughts of a better way to do
63:17 - this I mean this this seems like a
63:19 - similar issue to what so what we're
63:25 - doing right now
64:00 - okay
64:05 - let's so make a separate file for now
64:19 - I'm just gonna pull in
64:39 - let's just pull in with this other guy
64:42 - did on stackoverflow to give us
64:45 - something to go by I probably won't need
64:49 - to do right now I'm only worried really
64:52 - about the colors so I won't need all of
64:54 - it I could take probably most of it out
65:01 - let's fish my
65:13 - actually actually commit this first time
65:37 - so if you're not familiar with git or
65:40 - using the command line what I what I
65:43 - just did was I checked which files I had
65:45 - changed and then I committed those files
65:50 - I added a message
65:51 - so I actually committed and added at the
65:53 - same time that's with that a.m. flag is
65:56 - added a little commit message and then I
66:00 - pushed those changes up to the
66:02 - repository on github alright now what I
66:09 - want to do is make a new component let's
66:19 - say actually let's call it
66:37 - let's call it that and let's pop in
66:43 - whoops there we go
66:48 - so let's pull this stuff in I don't need
66:51 - the colors I don't think I'll need the
66:54 - color manipulator I'll leave it in for
66:58 - now I'm not worried about Cece and
67:02 - Eric's
67:08 - I'm not gonna change any of this right
67:11 - now so really I'm just worried about the
67:16 - palette okay so let's just try to change
67:24 - the primary color for now let me pull in
67:31 - all right let me show you guys the style
67:33 - guide this actually I had been telling
67:38 - people that I hadn't built anything in
67:39 - react until like spring of this year but
67:44 - I'm pretty sure that I actually built
67:46 - this in December and this is my first
67:48 - react project so this is in react and I
67:52 - think I did use this might be next
67:58 - Seana thing I think I originally tried
68:00 - to do this with create react app and
68:02 - then I wanted to try out next so this
68:05 - might be the version they use next can
68:08 - remember exactly so anyway it was not
68:11 - exactly true that well it's true to say
68:13 - like the first react project that
68:17 - actually went live you know for a client
68:19 - I did in the spring but this one was in
68:23 - December of 2016 and it's not officially
68:27 - live yet so it never it was supposed to
68:31 - be reviewed by some people higher up and
68:33 - that never really happened so it's it's
68:35 - already a bit outdated I've changed some
68:37 - of this but the part that I want is just
68:40 - these these colors so so this is all
68:46 - done with materialised framework but
68:49 - basically you can see what I was trying
68:53 - to do was you know kind of build out a
68:56 - custom version of the materialized theme
68:59 - with all the colors that we use at the
69:02 - University so for now I really just I
69:06 - need this dark green
69:11 - and just got a message from my boss so
69:17 - let me type this on my other screen back
69:18 - to him so I just want to try this out
69:36 - and see if it works so we'll just change
69:38 - the primary color need to put that like
69:44 - that so let's save that and then let's
69:47 - see how how they applied it
69:53 - so obviously this didn't work for them
69:57 - pretty she need to have static child
70:00 - context types and nothing
70:32 - all right so
70:39 - so I'm just trying to read over this and
70:42 - trying to make sense of what was done
71:04 - actually I want to see the the full code
71:08 - so I miss anything so let me see
71:27 - see
72:09 - pretty sure they call it a themed uh
72:11 - yeah a themed ojs right
72:26 - all right not really sure maybe it's
72:30 - been changed too much
72:31 - all right let me check much time okay it
72:35 - I thought I heard it beep alright so
72:37 - time for a little break to go to the
72:41 - live chat
72:52 - so you do want a custom theme it's this
72:55 - may be too much to try to fit in the
72:58 - rest of the stream we'll see we'll do as
73:01 - much as we can all right I'm gonna
73:11 - scroll up a bit and try to catch up then
73:14 - with the live Chad
74:00 - all right so lot going on the live chat
74:02 - but I'm not coming in upon a lot of
74:05 - questions yet so I'm going to keep
74:07 - scrolling and looking Vladimir asks can
74:14 - you suggest some learning paths from
74:15 - HTML CSS JavaScript react.js I would
74:20 - recommend try the free code camp
74:24 - challenges and work through that that's
74:27 - that's a decent foundation to kind of
74:30 - work your way up there's a lot of other
74:33 - good resources as well so I think I
74:38 - mentioned I did a video on my own
74:41 - channel about how I became a front-end
74:46 - developer and I think I mentioned some
74:47 - of the resources I use there so you can
74:49 - check that out the links in the
74:50 - description and I'd like at some point
74:53 - to do a more detailed video on that all
74:56 - the resources but I think free code camp
74:59 - is whilst definitely steer you in the
75:03 - right direction
75:12 - and so John Hanson says starting a new
75:15 - project just installed webpack I'll see
75:17 - where I'll go from there react look so
75:19 - tempting though I still want to use pug
75:21 - and sass jumping into es6 as well with
75:25 - babel that's a lot of change all at once
75:28 - so yeah you can still use sass with
75:33 - react I know there are ways to do it I I
75:36 - haven't done it but plug I don't know
75:42 - does anybody use plug with with react
75:45 - like would that even make sense I'm I
75:48 - definitely see why it would be it would
75:51 - be hard to switch if you're used to that
75:57 - yeah I agree Patrick says react is not
76:03 - your es6 is not hard to pick up web pack
76:07 - is a pain though I agree
76:09 - web package was at least for me it's
76:11 - difficult I think web pack is great but
76:13 - it's just difficult you know if you if
76:17 - you're not used to it it's really like a
76:19 - steep learning curve
76:30 - Dixie says nervous about making my
76:32 - tribute page any tips on how to not look
76:34 - at the source code and trusting my
76:37 - knowledge yeah I mean I guess you just
76:44 - got to resist that temptation to look at
76:46 - the source code and I would say don't
76:51 - the tribute page is a really really
76:53 - basic type of thing so you know work
76:57 - through don't don't get really nervous
76:59 - thinking it has to be perfect or
77:01 - everything just worry about meeting
77:02 - those user stories those requirements
77:05 - just the basics and then once you met
77:09 - those you know like hey like you've
77:11 - completed the project and then anything
77:13 - else you do on top of that is great but
77:15 - at least you got to that point where
77:17 - it's complete and I had a similar thing
77:20 - happen earlier so on my lunch break I
77:24 - was doing some work on my react course
77:27 - and the first project I had gotten to
77:30 - the point where I had fulfilled all the
77:32 - requirements but I didn't really do a
77:34 - lot of customizations and I thought
77:36 - about it and I really wanted to do
77:38 - customizations but I thought you know
77:40 - what I fulfilled it like I need to just
77:42 - turn this in and move on and learn more
77:44 - instead of worrying about trying to make
77:46 - it you know really really good and
77:48 - perfect so that's what I did so I just
77:51 - turned it in and it would be really cool
77:53 - if I had made it unique but you only
77:59 - only have so much time you know it was
78:01 - better you know to move on and continue
78:04 - learning than to wait and wait and get
78:07 - backed up and maybe never get to some of
78:09 - the later stuff in the course all right
78:13 - let me do scroll through a bit more NDM
78:20 - says how did you start learning react
78:23 - hey Andy and he also has a YouTube
78:25 - channel where he does live streams so
78:27 - you can check that out how did I start
78:34 - I think I started with just reading over
78:38 - the react documentation trying to get a
78:41 - hold of that and then I I did the course
78:45 - from code Academy and watched a bunch of
78:51 - YouTube videos that was like my very
78:53 - beginning and create react app then came
78:59 - out after so I think I had started
79:01 - trying to learn it before that came out
79:03 - when that came out it was cool when it
79:05 - was really helpful and then when next
79:07 - j/s started to get so when next Jess
79:09 - first started out it wasn't a lot of the
79:12 - features they have now they didn't have
79:13 - so it was okay but not nearly as good as
79:16 - it is now so as they added features then
79:18 - it started getting really fun to work
79:22 - with with next
79:47 - okay
79:52 - Galaxy Tab asks when building react
79:55 - project using Mac what software do I use
79:59 - yeah you just need a code editor I mean
80:02 - really I mean you need note okay it
80:04 - looks like Patrick Patrick answer it
80:07 - says whatever editor you want you also
80:10 - need node and NPM so that's cool
80:14 - galaxy says you don't need Xcode or
80:16 - Visual Studio yeah you don't need any of
80:18 - that
80:40 - alright I'm almost at the bottom Elijah
80:43 - that's why I'm kind of going everytime a
80:44 - little bit cuz it's just so tempting to
80:47 - get to the bottom John says John Samoa
80:52 - we have several John's that are in here
80:53 - so I have to start using the full name
80:56 - but Johnson Buddha says Jessie you rock
80:58 - more commits all sub slash viewers
81:02 - should submit pull requests and help him
81:04 - out that he can review offline oh well
81:07 - thanks for saying that that's cool
81:08 - yeah I totally don't expect you all to
81:11 - you know help help out so um I'll do
81:16 - this no matter what as long as I think
81:18 - it's helpful to you but yeah if you if
81:22 - you have if you have the time and you
81:25 - want to work on it and submit some pull
81:26 - requests um that's awesome of course
81:30 - like I can't guarantee that every pull
81:32 - request is going to make it in sometimes
81:33 - there are really good things that don't
81:35 - make it in just because I don't have
81:36 - time have to move on so it's not even
81:40 - necessarily because like I didn't like
81:42 - what you've done I might really like it
81:43 - and just don't have time to pull it in
81:45 - but yeah if anyway I appreciate you
81:50 - saying that
82:12 - okay all right so I'm pretty much to the
82:15 - bottom of the chat right now I'll come
82:17 - back to it in a bit all right
82:25 - so let's go this will probably be my
82:27 - last see what time it is yeah this will
82:30 - be my last Pomodoro session before we do
82:35 - questions and so I want to try to be
82:37 - done around for today is I think I
82:40 - mentioned it yesterday
82:41 - maybe I didn't all right I don't think I
82:43 - mention it so today is my wife's
82:45 - birthday and my my son's birthday so
82:50 - they they share a birthday so I want to
82:54 - get home at a decent time so that I can
82:57 - celebrate their birthday and then
83:01 - tomorrow is my other son's birthday so
83:04 - we've got like you know birthday weekend
83:07 - happening here all right so what were we
83:11 - working on we're trying to apply this
83:13 - theme right yes all right so I'm gonna
83:16 - move this over to my other screen for a
83:19 - second and I'm gonna come back here and
83:25 - look at I want to look at the actual
83:31 - documentation and compare it to what the
83:34 - this person was going on stackoverflow
83:37 - so this is asked by nose not much on
83:42 - Sakura flow
83:59 - okay that's good to know I didn't see
84:01 - that before it says never directly and
84:03 - you take the theme
84:40 - okay cool this this looks like I can do
84:45 - is just some basic manipulation of the
84:47 - theme just to try it out at first like
84:53 - this okay that works I don't know why
84:58 - but when I read this before it didn't
85:00 - make sense to me but then after after
85:03 - looking at again now it makes sense I
85:05 - guess that's out is it happens
85:07 - frequently maybe my my brain just needed
85:12 - to work on that subconsciously while I
85:14 - was doing other things to get it so so
85:19 - I'll probably end up putting some stuff
85:21 - in a separate file at first so I'm not
85:23 - going to delete this or anything I'll
85:25 - just leave it for now but I think really
85:27 - what I need to do is where I have is
85:33 - this theme provider I can add in this
85:40 - copy and paste this
85:53 - and
86:05 - and let me take that that color where
86:10 - did I have that that primary color
86:24 - I figured that was to take the whole
86:26 - thing primary cover
86:37 - okay
86:40 - now let's see what that does oops is not
86:45 - defined no undefined
86:58 - all right what am I doing wrong
87:09 - this is not fun uh maybe I did I'm not I
87:14 - didn't put this in
87:29 - cool check it out all right so our
87:34 - primary color which I suspected the
87:37 - primary color changed the title bark is
87:38 - that that made sense so I did cool and I
87:42 - think it shrunk did that are tired boy
87:45 - get smaller or at this calling app bar
87:48 - so material UI closes the app bar cool
87:53 - alright so now potentially if I want to
87:59 - I could use a separate file if I end up
88:02 - customizing a lot or if I don't I could
88:06 - I could just leave this in here if I'm
88:09 - only gonna customize a few things cool
88:18 - it's nice when things work oh cool I see
88:25 - if a lot of you saying happy birthday
88:28 - for my wife and both of my son's
88:30 - birthdays so thanks I'll let them know
88:33 - that you all said happy birthday
88:35 - sometimes like all my kids I'll say like
88:41 - occasionally if you all tell me to like
88:45 - tell my family or my kids something I'll
88:47 - say like everybody on YouTube said this
88:49 - and they kind of look at me like what's
88:51 - weird look
88:58 - the oh no I'm sorry I just got
89:04 - distracted I so I did the video on
89:12 - Instagram and I waited way too long to
89:16 - hit the share button and so now I
89:18 - couldn't share it so that's too bad I'll
89:23 - have to remember next time
89:26 - Tana looks like my wife posted a video
89:28 - on Instagram of my son Ambrose blowing
89:33 - out candles on a cupcake that's cool now
89:40 - now I wish I was home
89:49 - all right so let's so ace we have the
89:58 - color we can change our theme
90:01 - what's our secondary color gonna be
90:06 - probably the gold it's it's gonna be the
90:12 - gold or do we go think actually I might
90:14 - go with where so that the style guide I
90:20 - might go with this yellow
90:30 - I'm gonna see how this primary primary
90:35 - color - okay now okay I think I want the
90:38 - yellow to be the accent color primary
90:41 - color - maybe it'll be cold
90:44 - it probably won't really make any sense
90:47 - to change these yet because I don't have
90:48 - any elements on the page where I could
90:50 - see what it would do so I'm not gonna
90:52 - I'm not gonna do anything more with this
90:54 - until we build this out a little bit
90:55 - more actually what we'll probably do is
91:01 - we might not even have this title or
91:05 - this app bar be green I know it's like
91:08 - not exactly in line with the material
91:10 - design specs but I've been doing this a
91:12 - little bit differently lately where I
91:15 - have a white app bar with a thin gold
91:19 - border underneath and then we have a
91:23 - logo that's that uses the green and the
91:25 - gold colors that shows up nicely on the
91:28 - white so I might end up one with that
91:31 - too because my boss really likes that it
91:36 - looks nice it looks very nice it's clean
91:39 - so that might change but for now at
91:43 - least if we figured out how to change
91:46 - the theme colors so what we need now is
91:51 - to figure out our our basic layout let
91:55 - me see how much time I have left okay 15
91:58 - minutes all right so we need to figure
92:00 - out kind of like the basic layout that
92:02 - we're going to use and in case you you
92:06 - either didn't see or don't remember I'll
92:09 - bring over what we're going from
92:15 - and where did I put that I don't know
92:16 - where I put that so I'll just type it
92:20 - again all right so here's what here's
92:27 - what it currently looks like and I'm not
92:36 - gonna try to mimic this exactly
92:48 - but basically I need what I need is for
92:54 - users to be able to get to any section
92:56 - of this site immediately when the page
93:01 - loads so I don't want a long scrolling
93:02 - page so that's pretty much the only
93:08 - requirement for the the first screen
93:11 - that users see so I mean this works I
93:17 - could try to just mimic this what do
93:19 - y'all think let me know let me know what
93:23 - you think about maybe keeping this
93:31 - there's something similar
93:44 - okay so Patrick says plus one for the
93:47 - current layout yeah I my initial thought
93:51 - yesterday was to like change it but now
93:54 - that I look at it it's not I mean it
93:58 - works it's I don't really know what I
94:05 - would do that would be better to direct
94:08 - users to the different parts of the site
94:22 - okay cool looks I guess and get some
94:25 - more votes
94:28 - Rud Rud rank rank Shu Nandi sorry if I
94:34 - mess up the pronunciation for your name
94:36 - says make something out of the box I I
94:39 - would love to make something out of the
94:41 - box but I do have to keep the users in
94:43 - mind and in this case my users it's
94:46 - probably good to go over the who the
94:47 - users are for this with you all cuz I
94:49 - don't think I've done this yet my users
94:53 - are this is going to be an internal site
94:56 - for university employees and that
94:58 - includes a lot of people who are older
95:01 - professors who don't really use
95:05 - technology very much at all so I mean
95:09 - we're talking about like people like
95:12 - they don't have smartphones they want
95:15 - everything printed out there so I have
95:19 - to keep that user basin in mind so I
95:22 - mean there's the majority of people or
95:25 - like somewhat ok with using computers
95:27 - but there's definitely a group on campus
95:29 - that it needs to be very very
95:32 - straightforward so with that in mind
95:37 - then we you know we'll go forward with
95:40 - this so it seems like let's let's just
95:47 - try to keep this layout so basically we
95:49 - just need columns we need three column
95:54 - layout two rows how to I don't even
95:57 - remember how this looks ok so then it
96:00 - just goes yeah so we just need to set up
96:05 - two break points and I have no idea how
96:09 - the break points and the grid system
96:11 - works in material UI so let's check that
96:13 - out
96:15 - is that okay
96:24 - grid okay cool
96:54 - so I guess this is similar to what I
96:59 - need
97:29 - so say this is a grid list I'm wondering
97:36 - is there a layout something more than
97:45 - I'm missing here
97:52 - so it wouldn't even it wouldn't
97:54 - necessarily be a component I don't know
98:33 - yeah I don't think the grid list is what
98:36 - I'm really looking for I'm wondering now
98:44 - this material UI then does it not come
98:48 - with a like a system of columns
99:13 - actually if if it is the case that it
99:17 - doesn't come with a system of columns
99:18 - I'm wondering if I can just pull out
99:20 - then the whole black column system from
99:24 - materialise and use it use it here
99:51 - all right
99:54 - okay Christian said I might have to new
99:57 - use the newer version I'm buried this is
100:04 - an enumerative also we're back to this
100:06 - so it yesterday I originally had this
100:12 - version installed and then I switched
100:13 - and installed the new version and then I
100:18 - was advised to not use the new version
100:22 - since it wasn't really ready yet and so
100:24 - I switched it back to the old version
100:29 - I let me I'm not I don't think I'm gonna
100:33 - switch over but I just want to see it I
100:35 - wanna see what it's like it
101:01 - yeah this actually is exactly what I
101:04 - want I don't know I don't know everyone
101:09 - I really kind of want to switch now
101:25 - yeah
101:33 - all right now and now everybody's saying
101:43 - switch Maxie me I don't think I can't
101:48 - use get get revert of revert anyway I
101:53 - changed too many things I think yeah I'm
102:01 - like I might switch back let me check
102:03 - really quick because I know you all told
102:04 - me yesterday that there were some
102:06 - components that I couldn't use because
102:08 - they weren't ready with this one man I
102:10 - just like how close is this to being
102:12 - done like are we talking like a year
102:16 - until it's released or I can't I really
102:20 - want to I don't want to know
102:43 - I didn't see anything talking about a
102:45 - time line
102:59 - all right let's see what components who
103:01 - we are all right we have the app bar
103:03 - right that's that standard let's see
103:06 - what an e be a bar for sure I don't care
103:10 - about the bottom nerve right now
103:12 - I'll need cards which that should like
103:16 - that standard
103:19 - I need form elements let's see what the
103:22 - form that that might be the deal breaker
103:24 - so we have text fields where's my okay
103:34 - cool I like using the ones where the
103:37 - label pops out all right awesome so we
103:39 - got a text fields we need select with a
103:44 - Canadian column select they were
103:45 - dropdowns right do we not have dropdowns
103:55 - okay here's some checkboxes it's good
104:00 - actually I'm not I don't really like
104:02 - that as much as the way materialized
104:04 - doesn't I might have to modify that
104:09 - component because I really like the way
104:12 - materialized of it
104:16 - cool all right I'll I I do like that
104:20 - switches
104:42 - okay so menus so basically text field
104:49 - select menus coming soon all right so
104:55 - they don't have that this should work
105:00 - though for what I needed to do just like
105:04 - a regular menu as long as I can just get
105:10 - the value of whatever is clicked on
105:11 - which shouldn't be a problem then all
105:15 - right cool
105:16 - um I think that this version actually
105:19 - does have everything that I need so
105:27 - maybe we'll go with it
105:28 - all right I know it looks like some of
105:35 - the people that were really against me
105:36 - using the the latest version of this are
105:40 - not here right now so so they're not
105:48 - here to tell me not to do it Oh
105:55 - Maxie man I know I know it was a joke
105:58 - about the river it was just I was just
106:05 - reading it out
106:12 - ok Johnson muta says you know you'll be
106:14 - upgrading later might as well do it now
106:17 - Christian says feels pretty stable
106:19 - finished to me smack says I always
106:28 - wondered how long it takes to make a
106:29 - legit web app by yourself it's I suppose
106:32 - it takes a long time if you keep
106:34 - switching your your framework back and
106:36 - forth every day okay John smoother says
106:47 - it could fork it KB and says look at the
106:51 - roadmap oh okay cool am I missing the
106:53 - roadmap then what is that
107:20 - oh this has support for some CSS and J's
107:25 - that's cool I like that better than
107:28 - having to do all inline stuff so it's
107:32 - another plus
107:52 - okay Kevin as linked ok so there's some
107:57 - issues check out the github
108:16 - okay cool this is super helpful thank
108:20 - you thank you for this link also my
108:22 - timer went off so the the rest of this
108:27 - is until I'd like to end around 4
108:31 - o'clock so I'll try to get as many
108:32 - questions answered as I can and if I
108:35 - don't get to your question just send it
108:37 - to me on Twitter or put it in the
108:38 - comments below if you were just here for
108:41 - the code thank you so much for watching
108:43 - and for for helping me out and I'll be
108:45 - back next week alright so let me look
108:49 - just quickly at this hmm this is as of
109:00 - all right so this was edited six months
109:04 - ago so I assume it's better now
109:31 - yes it looks like maybe this list is not
109:50 - maybe it's not up to date
109:56 - is there's a new section now in the docs
109:59 - let's see
110:05 - all right let's check the docks then
110:45 - I said they added it but I don't
110:46 - remember seeing that oh yeah there it is
110:50 - haha I can't believe I miss that
110:54 - cool
111:29 - to say don't support multi-line text
111:32 - fields it can't be that hard to apply
111:38 - the same styles to a multi-line text
111:41 - field as you can to a single line so
111:44 - assuming this list is up-to-date this is
111:46 - probably one that might be able to do a
111:48 - pull request for and get that updated
111:55 - okay let me go to the live chat now I'm
112:00 - gonna scroll up a bit and try to answer
112:02 - as many questions as I can right now I'm
112:09 - thinking that I'm I'm gonna switch and
112:11 - if they don't have something that we
112:13 - need we will add it and potentially
112:18 - submit a pull request and contribute to
112:20 - this project so like I mentioned
112:24 - yesterday I've actually been wanting to
112:25 - either do something like this on my own
112:28 - or contribute to one so I think I found
112:32 - a decent one to contribute to okay
112:38 - Sorrenti so sss r NT y s is react hard I
112:44 - don't know I think something being hard
112:48 - or not is really relative questions so
112:50 - react doesn't seem that hard to me now
112:53 - but when I first started it did seem
112:55 - really hard so I mean just like anything
112:59 - you know practice at it and keep at it
113:01 - and you'll be I mean a year ago I was
113:07 - just hearing about react you know now
113:10 - I'm able to actually build things with
113:12 - react at work so you know in less than a
113:16 - year you can get to a point where you
113:18 - could you could be getting paid to make
113:20 - react stuff
113:42 - let's see Christian as you mentioned
113:48 - earlier the discount at udacity would
113:51 - you recommend it to learn react where
113:53 - would you place it in relation to free
113:55 - code camp okay that's actually a really
113:59 - good question so for me this is how I've
114:05 - used free code camp and Udacity so this
114:08 - is going to be pretty specific to me but
114:10 - there might be some other people in
114:12 - similar position than I am
114:14 - so free code camp is really easy to just
114:19 - go in and do really quick things
114:23 - especially like in the browser just go
114:27 - in and do the exercises and spend like a
114:30 - few minutes a day just doing something
114:32 - just to you know just to keep things
114:34 - fresh in your mind so for me I used it
114:37 - like that that's where I would come in
114:40 - like before I started work I would do
114:43 - one challenge from free code camp now
114:45 - there are like projects that you can't
114:47 - just do in a couple minutes but a lot of
114:50 - the challenges you could finish in a few
114:52 - minutes
114:52 - so that's how I would use it and just do
114:55 - it just a little bit every day for
114:57 - Udacity it's it's set up as these large
115:00 - courses a lot of them are free which is
115:03 - really cool
115:04 - but I was less able to just do things so
115:09 - some of the courses do have in browser
115:11 - exercises but a lot of them require you
115:13 - to set up your development environment
115:16 - so those were more like if I had a an
115:20 - hour to work on something then I could
115:22 - do that so and and those were also
115:27 - sometimes really specific to something
115:29 - that I wanted to learn you know so
115:31 - they're broken up into these courses so
115:33 - if I really wanted to focus on one thing
115:36 - I could do that and be done with that
115:38 - course free code campus is more like
115:41 - just a linear progression all the way
115:43 - through it's a little bit harder to just
115:45 - pick and choose things because it builds
115:48 - so anyway so I use them both at the same
115:53 - time and it was simply a matter of
115:56 - I tried to do a little bit from free
115:58 - code camp every day and if I had a few
116:00 - minutes it was free code camp if I had
116:02 - some specific topic that I really wanted
116:05 - to go like in more depth with I would
116:08 - use Udacity and I would have to set
116:13 - aside more time to do it the majority of
116:17 - what I've done from Udacity has been all
116:19 - their free stuff this react course that
116:22 - I'm taking now is the first time I've
116:24 - actually paid for they call them nano
116:26 - degrees from Udacity so so far I've been
116:30 - happy with it but there's more than
116:32 - enough free content on Udacity that you
116:35 - could learn a lot without paying for
116:37 - anything so hopefully that helps
116:42 - hopefully answer your question
116:50 - okay Johnson mood has had just made it
116:53 - over from another live coding session at
116:55 - treehouse cool I didn't realize
116:57 - treehouse had live coding I'll have to
116:59 - often check that out is the treehouse
117:01 - live coding is it free or is it
117:04 - something that you have to pay for so I
117:07 - know some of their stuff is paid and
117:09 - they do offer some free things John also
117:13 - said thank you for the live work you're
117:14 - welcome thanks for watching
117:22 - adventurous programmers said I use
117:24 - Stephen Ritter's webpack course on udemy
117:27 - for ten dollars to learn web pack to
117:30 - made it easy that's really good to know
117:32 - thanks for sharing that so if anybody's
117:34 - trying to learn web pack check out udemy
117:39 - Stephen Stephen graders web pack course
117:44 - so yeah again thanks for that
118:01 - okay ooh brain shoo Nandi says you he
118:08 - provided a link to where you could use
118:11 - pug with react so it's if there's a
118:13 - babble plug-in to use plug with react so
118:18 - if you check out the the pug repo on
118:21 - github it looks like it's in there so
118:23 - thanks for sharing that that battery con
118:33 - says I am just I'm just a beginner but
118:35 - my friend said JavaScript is very
118:37 - complex and hard to learn is this true I
118:42 - don't I don't know if it's I don't
118:47 - really think JavaScript is that complex
118:49 - and hard to learn but you know i've i've
118:53 - been using javascript for years so it's
118:59 - i guess it's hard to remember what it
119:00 - was like at the beginning learning so I
119:03 - would say like if you're thinking about
119:05 - learning it go for it you know there's
119:09 - you're not really risking anything by
119:11 - trying it you'll find out soon whether
119:13 - or not you think it's too complicated
119:15 - but I mean I I don't think like a lot of
119:22 - people learn it you know you know
119:26 - average people of average intelligence
119:27 - learn it so I don't think it's you know
119:30 - that difficult
119:43 - John says John Hanson says it's odd to
119:46 - see you code react here as pug as much
119:49 - of the same sort of thing as component
119:51 - building they're just the HTML it uses
119:54 - JavaScript feels very logical to me the
119:57 - reactant yeah yeah definitely reactives
120:01 - does remind me a bit of different like
120:04 - templating different ways to do
120:08 - templating so yeah it shouldn't it
120:13 - shouldn't be that much of a jump to move
120:16 - to react from something else like pug or
120:19 - I guess even you can think of like
120:21 - handlebars or something like that hey
120:30 - Jordan how's it going Jordan said hi
121:04 - okay so Patrick said earlier let me put
121:08 - this up on the screen
121:09 - Patrick really dislikes that I was doing
121:12 - this in index J s and thought I should
121:15 - be doing it an app j s so okay so that's
121:23 - cool I mean that will not be a problem
121:25 - to move that over so I mean I'm not
121:29 - gonna do it right now but basically you
121:31 - know she lets you know what I would do
121:33 - it'd be as simple as removing kind of
121:40 - this out of here and then wrapping it
121:43 - wrapping app in this so it would have
121:48 - the same the same effect I'm assuming I
121:52 - don't see any reason why it wouldn't
121:53 - work
122:06 - Kevin asked this register serviceworker
122:08 - come with create react app yes it did I
122:11 - didn't add that in that came by default
122:19 - Zanna said I don't quite get it what is
122:22 - supposed to be that white space under
122:23 - there so yeah I think I assumed you were
122:26 - talking about this all this white space
122:28 - yeah that was probably just I had the
122:32 - idea that I wanted this overlap up here
122:36 - so yeah it's always gonna have this
122:40 - white space probably what I'll end up
122:44 - doing is vertically centering this if I
122:47 - redo it because I'm not gonna have this
122:48 - giant header so everything would be
122:52 - vertically centered so there would still
122:53 - be a lot of white space but it would be
122:55 - at least evenly distributed okay cool
123:06 - and I just read Roe on your comment
123:08 - about moving the grid towards the bottom
123:10 - and so yeah that's exactly what I intend
123:13 - to do
123:16 - Zanna says I suggest you make an
123:18 - accessibility audit yeah that's that's
123:21 - actually a good idea
123:22 - I'm actually really conscious of helping
123:30 - people who are blind or have vision
123:34 - impairments being able to go through the
123:35 - site so we do have one professor who's
123:38 - blind and so I want to make sure that
123:41 - she can in all the sites that I do I
123:44 - really do want to make sure that she can
123:45 - you know see it be able to use a screen
123:49 - reader for everything so when I
123:50 - initially made this I'm not sure that I
123:53 - I kept that in mind as much as I should
123:56 - but I definitely want to this time so
124:00 - I'm gonna have to look up some more with
124:01 - it as well because I'm sure there's some
124:06 - stuff that I could be doing that I'm not
124:07 - also I have an uncle that's blind so I'm
124:09 - always like what I'm doing sites I'm
124:12 - always thinking like would he even be
124:14 - able to use this site so
124:20 - so thanks for bringing that up s-- and i
124:22 - definitely it's definitely something i
124:25 - want to keep in mind as I'm building it
124:52 - I'm just reading all the messages that
124:54 - you all had about me switching to the
124:57 - newer version of material UI so it seems
125:03 - like the messages now are just excited
125:05 - for going for it as they were yesterday
125:10 - about not going for it I mean to be fair
125:15 - there are different people in here today
125:17 - a lot of different people than there
125:19 - were yesterday so so it's not like
125:26 - everybody's changing them I'm changing
125:28 - my mind but not I don't know that you
125:32 - all are changing master mine says hello
125:39 - sir what's HTML Java JavaScript and CSS
125:44 - alright that's that's like a really big
125:46 - question let me try to give a very like
125:49 - succinct answer so I'm not going to talk
125:54 - about Java Java is a programming
125:55 - language computer programming language
125:58 - that I'm not very familiar with so I'm
126:01 - gonna leave that out now but things like
126:04 - Android apps are built with Java but as
126:08 - far as HTML Javascript and CSS those are
126:11 - the languages that websites are built
126:14 - from so the HTML would be gives the
126:18 - structure to the page the javascript
126:21 - helps with interactivity so things
126:23 - moving around on the page data being
126:26 - sent to different places and then the
126:29 - CSS is the style of the page you know
126:31 - the colors the fonts things like that so
126:36 - I guess as an analogy if you were
126:40 - building a house the HTML would be the
126:42 - frame of the house the CSS would be all
126:45 - the decorations and then the JavaScript
126:48 - would be like all the electricity
126:49 - running through the house and the
126:51 - plumbing that makes the water flow and
126:53 - the lights turn on
126:55 - and you know things like that not really
126:57 - a perfect analogy but I think it works
127:01 - well enough
127:02 - oh cool Christian says I had mentioned
127:10 - earlier based on the documentation I was
127:13 - looking at that they didn't support
127:14 - multi-line text fields but Christian
127:16 - says they do support it and Christian is
127:19 - using those multi-line text fields so
127:21 - good to know so evidently that
127:22 - documentation is not updated so I'll
127:27 - just have to see for myself and you know
127:31 - what's available what's not and not rely
127:33 - on that documentation
127:50 - okay Patrick says has pasted in some
127:54 - content from the material UI roadmap
127:57 - okay there's the Reb map dot M D off to
128:00 - check out that file later but it says
128:02 - first both versions can be used at the
128:05 - same time people can progressively
128:06 - migrate one component at a time that's
128:09 - really cool okay that's something I'll
128:11 - have to think about maybe I don't have
128:13 - to completely switch maybe I can just
128:15 - pull in some of the components that I
128:16 - need so that's really cool that must
128:20 - mean that they're actually really
128:21 - compatible if you can just pull in a
128:24 - component when you need it that's good
128:26 - to know
128:28 - Christian asks what will the back end be
128:30 - for your application I guess in it like
128:37 - in terms of like the back end it's just
128:41 - going to be I'm not exactly sure what
128:42 - you're asking so I'll just give you a
128:44 - basic idea of like the whole stack so I
128:47 - mean I'm gonna run it obviously with
128:49 - node and Express and then the data
128:55 - there's not I'm not really dealing with
128:57 - a lot of data so I'm gonna send data to
128:59 - a project management system called Reich
129:02 - and then I'm gonna email it out
129:05 - as well I haven't decided yet if I'm
129:08 - actually gonna try to save data in a
129:10 - database it might be cool to do that so
129:14 - it may depending on how long this takes
129:16 - I may have time to try to do something
129:19 - like that but I'm not super familiar
129:21 - with how to set up databases so so
129:26 - anyway that's it's it's not going to be
129:28 - really complex a complex site
129:39 - okay cool Patrick says I was always on
129:42 - Team go for it awesome this is I think
129:49 - the last comment so this would be the
129:51 - last question that I am that I answer
129:54 - for today and it's from pear cake so
129:57 - pear cake says hi Jessie can you give an
129:59 - advice where I can find good app specs
130:02 - that I can read and implement in a
130:04 - fairly big react app I'm not very good
130:07 - at imagining apps for practice hmm I
130:14 - don't know
130:17 - so I'm guessing let me know if I'm wrong
130:21 - on this but base like you're asking for
130:24 - ideas for large apps that you can make I
130:28 - know I don't know what the websites are
130:31 - it's been so long since I've been on
130:33 - them but I know there are some sites
130:34 - that just give a ton of ideas for for
130:37 - apps so people just you know offer their
130:40 - ideas and you can you can work on them
130:44 - so try to look up something like that
130:47 - I just I'm sorry I just I can't remember
130:50 - at all with the name of the these even
130:53 - even one of those sites were and I'm
130:55 - pretty sure there's several different
130:57 - ones so I would check out something like
131:00 - that otherwise like you could you know
131:05 - try asking colleagues or you know
131:09 - friends family for their ideas about
131:12 - things so I'm somewhat similar situation
131:16 - that I don't I don't exactly have a lot
131:20 - of ideas on my own it's hard to come up
131:22 - with them alright okay cool christian
131:26 - said ideas watch.com slash start-up
131:30 - ideas slash app so cool Thank You
131:34 - Christian
131:34 - alright so patrick says go celebrate
131:37 - with your family so and he says thanks
131:41 - for stream you welcome and i'm
131:44 - definitely going to do that right now so
131:46 - thank you all so much for watching and
131:48 - for all of your help it's
131:51 - day and didn't get a lot done in terms
131:54 - of what's on the screen but I think we I
131:57 - have a much better understanding of
131:59 - material UI so I think it was it was a
132:03 - good day for learning so yeah so Co on
132:10 - Monday and have a great weekend

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody is Jessie and today we're going to continue right where we left off yesterday so I had to work on some other stuff and I had to fix one problem with the project that we had worked on previously that had to do with the JW player video but I kind of fixed it was basically a workaround but I'm done with that and I'm ready to start on this project yesterday we made some decisions about it and we're going to use material UI as the framework and we use create react app to get everything started so today we're just going to go through and try to build our layout with material UI I've never used it before I'm familiar with material design but I'm not familiar with material UI specifically so this is kind of going to be a trial and error learning session today where you're just going to go through and see how things work if you're watching on Instagram this is the the view of me coding so if you want to see the code check it out on the free code camp youtube channel you can watch it live now or if you have seen the recording later on this will be the title of the video is react project day to learning material UI and that's on the live coding with Jessie playlist on the free code camp channel alright so let me get you take a look at the live chat say hello to everyone all right hey everyone cool let's see some familiar faces and some new people so if you're new welcome and don't be afraid to ask questions give advice definitely open to to that if you are new this is not really a tutorial this is just me doing my everyday work so there are going to be mistakes it's not rehearsed beforehand so I guess that's it can be good at times because we try to work through the mistake so eventually we usually figure out the right way to do things let me know yesterday we had some issues where my phone was giving interference with my microphone so let me know if that happens again and I can move it so right now I'm trying to manage the phone streaming at the same time as the YouTube streaming so if it's too much I can just cut the the phone stream I don't have nearly as many people watch the phone stream alright so just go in the live chat real quick see everyone wow the tailor says it's it's night time it's to 200 a.m. Wow Taylor where you at right now that it's 200 a.m. already Alessandra put the little parenthesis and the the fire looks like the free code camp logos that's really cool let's see white white lightning says hey Jessie big fan of material design some interesting how you tackle material UI cool yeah i'm i really like material design as well so I'm really hoping material UI turns out to be awesome because I'd love to use it let's see okay I think we can get started Oh Sean says Jessie I've had some problems with the previous react project okay let me know uh oh Sean send me a message on Twitter and let me know what issues you're having or you can open up an issue on the github repo for that project so I'd like to know what's going on with that and see if we can get those problems fixed Evo says 8 p.m. here in the Netherlands so perfect time for live stream cool that's cool I always I don't really worry that much about what time I stream because people are watching from everywhere so it doesn't really matter what time I stream it's gonna be you know a different time for everyone so it would be cool to do it maybe some morning streams my time just to give people a chance to watch it who maybe can never watch it 1130 p.m. in India Alan from Michigan seer hey how's it going I have heard of react MD I have not used it the Kevin says how are you not bad I'm pretty tired got up really early with the baby this morning so definitely running on some caffeine I had a double espresso this morning and right now I'm drinking some G fuel it's like an energy drink so hopefully I can do a good job in this stream I usually get pretty pumped up when I'm doing the stream and I don't feel quite as tired unless it's like a three hour stream then I start to feel it alright so I'm gonna get started I'll come back periodically and check out the live shot and try to answer the questions I've been having a lot of people ask a lot of questions in the live chat so let me know what you all think but I've been thinking about maybe have some sort of moderator in the chat not really to like tell people what to do but just to keep track of when people ask questions so there's some questions that I probably don't need to answer like when people ask about like what what editor I'm using or what the theme is things like that there are basic questions or when people come in and say like hey what are you working on which those are valid questions especially if you knew but everybody else in the live chat could could answer those just as well as I could so those kind of questions would be cool to have the moderator basically categorized the questions between ones that have a simple answer that could just be handled in live chat and the ones that I probably should answer and then you know when it's time for me to go back to the live chat to answer questions then I would I'd be able to see those somehow so I'm not sure exactly how it'll work out maybe there's already something developed to handle stuff like that and if you all know about a good way to handle that let me know and if anybody's interested in kind of being a moderator let me know as well I would just say if you are going to be a moderator make sure you're somebody who doesn't have a bad temper and is very patient because I like to keep everything really positive no matter what people are saying so I don't want anybody getting upset at the the people in the live chat I don't consider any question to be you know like too much of a noob question or anything so anyway so I'm gonna give it some thought and if you all want to give some thought and let me know you know maybe I'll do that we'll see yesterday was a crazy day we had just a lot of people in the chat today is still above average but not quite as crazy so maybe I won't need it we'll see for right now I'm gonna start up my Pomodoro timer and try to you get into our first coding session oh one more thing this is not an endorsement just just a helpful fYI Udacity is having I think like a 50% off sale right now in their courses so if you were thinking about doing a course from Udacity now would probably be a good time to sign up because there you know that's a pretty big discount for their courses so unfortunately I already signed up for my course about a month ago so I won't get the discount but I know I think some of you in the chat had mentioned that you're interested in doing some of the courses like the react course or anything so it's a good deal right now alright so as you can see I didn't do literally I did nothing with this project since yesterday I didn't even have time to set this up so I don't even have a link to this yet because right now there's nothing in there so I'm not I'm not gonna worry about the Trello board I'll kind of have to like go back and fill in what we've done I am keeping track of the the time that I've put into this on a separate spreadsheet on my other screen so I'm gonna know how much time I put into things I'll just have to fill out the Trello board later on alright so let's get our code up here let me get things organized how we probably normally have it let's see I think I probably want to do kind of a side by side to minimize that and I yeah this should work I probably don't need to see places right now we can get rid of that and let's get rid of this side there we go that'll give us plenty of space increase the font a bit let me know if that font is too small and I probably won't look at the chat for a little while but if I see it all I'll make it a bit bigger okay so one thing I noticed yesterday but I didn't do anything about is that this doesn't do anything and it seems like it should right so let's I'm gonna see what's going on here I think this is probably one of those things where that that kind of extra click thing that we had talked about yesterday see I don't need that let's go to the setup and see what they were saying about okay so this tap event plugin this is probably what we need to make that work so let's bring that in well these semicolons are freaking me out a little bit on the last project I got used to not using the semicolons and now they're there and I can't take it they just look I'm just gonna take them out right now it's been really bothering that I do we get them all no one more all right cool no semicolons I think at some point we're gonna have to eject create react app and do some X some stuff with it because I'd love to have the automatic formatting like we had when our with our other project alright so is this I just want to see if I have to actually install this if it comes with it looks like I have to install it so I mean it's worth a shot to see if it comes with it first but and it's hmm so I'm wondering it at least this is not really descriptive in terms of what I to put this inside of component didn't mounts I mean would that be maybe I'll look at these docks might be a bit better oh okay so we're saying just initialize it right there okay all right let's try it out like I said I might have to install this it didn't say on these instructions so there's I guess the possibility that it'll just work didn't start up my server so let me start up my dev server in the console here let's see where am I it's just going to use yarn start I did see somebody left a comment in the video yesterday about like the latest version of NPM is actually just as fast as yarn and it has like the same a similar lock file so Wow the the error page looks way different for create react app than it did for for next that's that's crazy but anyway for this project at least I'm gonna stick with yarn since I've already I'm already using it but I'll have to look into that and maybe in future projects I'll I'll just use the newest version of NPM I just I just saw I just happened to look over quickly to live chat and I saw white lightnings comment about his question his or her question sorry about why not use semicolons basically I did use semicolons and then on the last project everyone watching the stream kind of convinced me not to use them and we had like some Auto formatting going on with we're using prettier for that and it automatically removed semicolons so I just got used to it and now that I got used to it I don't want to go back it's really nice to not have to type out that semicolon it seems to me that if there's not really a difference between semicolons and not semicolons then the easier route is better and easier route being just not at a semicolon so I mean that works for me I don't really care if anybody else use semicolons it's not it doesn't bother me if they use semicolons but at least for my projects I think I'm gonna not use semicolons anymore so boys that I just want to see all right so tap event plugin so this should be what we need let's go to our console where do you go now I moved it to the side sorry yeah this is it okay yarn add actually let me make this bigger I made this smaller earlier just to give me more space to work with there we go so we're gonna add that tap event plugin and hopefully everything works okay there we go all right let's try to restart there we go and okay well still nothing happens we probably needed to install that anyway so I'm not really worried about that but I do want to see why I think I was going down the wrong path here in terms of trying to find this out so it looks like it wasn't the type of M plugin I think this is the code that we use let's see what is going on I need I'm assuming that this is basically also you know the same component here so obvious obviously it's working there yeah this is a react site let's just see how they did it I'm gonna check the live chat here in a second too because I'm sure that some of you are thinking Jessie what are you doing here's the simple answer that often happens you are usually ahead of the game or at least ahead of me alright so let's see what was that who's the name of that app bar here we go it's odd it's just not really a nap board component oh well maybe maybe mine doesn't even have a nap bar component oh yeah so it looks like maybe it's a different version for that I don't know so there's a huge difference I guess between what's going on with the you know between my site and this site so I'm probably not going to be able to use that for an example so let me check out the the live chat here alright let's see I'll screw up a bit just to see okay so it looks like you do not add an event for left button and app bar so if you click it nothing at okay so I have to add oh it's actually have to add the event okay cool good to know thanks Sebastian and tour I I'm not sure how would you pronounce that it's it looks like it's t o re so let me know how you want me to pronounce that okay you must add props to the phone okay cool let's check out I'm gonna move this I guess I don't need to move this over right now I don't need to see it so let's check out what props there we go I feel a little bit silly now if I would have just scroll down and read all this I would have known sometimes it's just more fun to just try it and see what happens especially if I'm doing a stream like I don't want to spend the whole time reading that would be boring alright so callback function every touch so alright cool so I do need to add let's add this drawer area cool how do I get out of the drawer okay so let's put in a drawer and import all these all right so I'm not gonna include the button sexually I probably don't need this button because I want to make my my icon the drawer so I just need this drawer and I guess I'll put this oops just put this right below the app at bar and we'll leave it to state open for now just to see it make sure it's working and let's see all right I'm not gonna worry about this for now I just want to see if it works oops gonna be property open oh yeah let's see of course I have to put state in and let's leave it open okay cool nice and all right so now let's go back to our yeah let's go back to our app bar and let's see on left icon I'm gonna add this this weird per second I kept clicking and it wasn't doing anything it was odd so we're gonna want for now just something simple so let's say I'll just copy what they have here save some typing okay thanks Patrick Pat Patrick just paste it in the live chat exactly what what I need to do here so cool okay I see oops what's going on here I expect it's okay only this whoa what is this what did I do all right whatever happened there it didn't happen again so I'm cool with that okay No okay thanks I forgot this yeah all right cool it's always the worst awesome okay it seems like that's the hardest part when I do live streams is you just forget syntax that you type all the time but for some reason when it's live your mind just blanks so I really appreciate it when you all catch that and uh and let me know what the syntax is it saves me having to look it up which I'm fine with going but it does keep the stream moving along faster when you all help me out like that so I really do appreciate it okay so we need the desired behavior is that if you click outside of this it will close so let's let's check on that so I'll probably need to go back into the drawer component and let's see this has got to be any I mean this is pretty basic functionality so okay I think I probably forgot to add something mmm no I guess I didn't all right this is the one I want I want to say so I'm trying to figure out which which part which part of this is actually making it is it the undocked part let's see what on doctors dot okay so it just brings up the overlay so that makes sense hmm that not all right so I'm not seeing the overlay now what did I do okay I did not put this in there which maybe that's what's messing things up No all right I'm gonna look at the live chat oh man you guys saw it Sebastian I see Sebastian saw it for sure I added the this these two props I had it on the wrong component so I did have open what am I thinking okay so now this will make a lot more sense to me hopefully this is what I need yeah okay it works cool alright my timer is up so I'm gonna take a short break to go to the live chat and check up on what I missed answer some questions I'm preparing myself mentally now to see all of you telling me what I was doing wrong since I just made a series of silly mistakes alright so let me scroll up a bit no I got 82 viewers now that's that's nice it's um it's definitely over what we normally average so probably a lot of new people and I'm guessing so welcome thanks for watching and so I'm scrolling almost all the way back up to the top Carl says hey Jesse or anyone after completing the JavaScript section on free code camp is it safe to try and jump into react or is there more to do I'd say go ahead and jump into reacts I I don't think there's anything wrong with you know trying it out if it seems like it's too difficult then maybe you know go to something else and come back to it later on but you don't have to be a JavaScript master to know react and you'll get better at JavaScript as you do react because you'll find yourself using parts of JavaScript that you maybe didn't use before that was my experience all right we got people from someone from the Ivory Coast Ukraine oh man Philip says I'm feeling you there my son got up at 500 a.m. this morning can't wait until he is a teen I don't think I've ever heard anyone say can't wait till he's a teen usually people hey Dredd the teenagers but yeah I suppose teenagers will probably sleep in so I guess that's something to look forward to I'll finally get better sleep with my kids get bigger now it's Steven as says Steven says I'd love to see a black screen with green font much easier for an old guy to watch I could say if if you all have a really cool theme you'd like to suggest to me put it in the comments for this video or you can message me on Twitter but I'm using Adam as my code editor so if you do have a theme for that that you want to suggest I'll try it out if I if I like it then you know maybe I'll do that for the streams I don't think I've changed my theme for years are the same same theme so it might be cool to change it up all right let's see alright looks like some of you you're saying that I could use a bot to help moderate the chat that would be cool hey Phillip votes for Patrick to be the moderator hi from Down Under oh cool so Jack does that mean you're from Australia because that's cool if you are from Australia because I've never had anyone in the live chat say that they were from Australia and that's the only like the only continent other than of course Antarctica that I haven't had somebody say that they're from so that's really awesome now I can honestly tell people that I've had people from all the habitated continents okay Stephen said the udacity sail is actually more than 50% off that's awesome also since we're talking about sails Nordstrom has has sales going on right now if you need some clothes I needed a new pair of black dress shoes so I bought a pair on my lunch break also anytime I talk about a product or anything I don't officially endorse or get paid to talk about anything so this is all my honest opinion Stephen says yeah use prettier atom package oh yeah I haven't thought about that just using the atom package before I it was like a like a commit hook to where every time I committed it would change everything use standard J s as well for linting but I hadn't even thought of just doing it in atom I can't would like to have it as part of like the commit hook so that if people want to do a pull request everything is the same but I guess until I checked actually I'm not sure is it do I need that's probably a good question let me check this out do I even need to eject create react app in order to set that up I thought I did but now but I'm thinking about it I don't I really don't think I will because I don't really need to change anything with with like web pack so I think I could just do it so maybe I'll try not right now but at some point maybe I'll try to just bring over a lot of the stuff we use for the last project for linting and like formatting and try to use it here all right so my fiveminute timer is up for the chat so I'm gonna just kind of go through really really quickly and see if there's anything super important that I I should address before I go on okay so see there are some questions I'll try to come back to the questions a little bit later Wow 215 a.m. and China looks like Sierra from 215 a.m. and China Wow so thanks for staying up so late and watching Thailand South Way says seeing this is awesome I'm currently making my tribute page keep up the good work that's cool send me send me a message on Twitter I want to see the the tribute page when when you're done with it that would be cool so if you don't mind I'd like to check that out Ricardo from Brazil says your live streams are great awesome thank you best of hardstyle from Portugal I enjoy some some hardstyle occasionally ok cool let's get back to work if by the way if you ask a question in the chat and you're not able to stick around until I go through it later on you can just send it to me on Twitter or put it in the comments for this video and then I will get to it later on when I can because I realize yeah sometimes the streams go really long so it might be an hour or more before I get to your question so it's not really reasonable to expect that everyone can stick it out through the entire stream all right so let's let's see what were you doing ok we're setting this up so we've got our sidebar here which is awesome and does anybody else do this when you make something that's interactive like this you just click it a million times I don't know I've done that I've had clients say that they do that too and when they test the site it's just like satisfying somehow alright so that's not bad right now for the layout let's put in a footer because that'll be a standard layout for every view is going to have the have the sidebar and a footer so let's check out what we have to work with here with the footer do we have a footer okay maybe maybe no maybe we don't okay so there's a potentially maybe there's a footer there's hope cuz there's a footer for this site am I just missing it with stepper I'm not used to this terminology this is definitely different than materialized okay that's cool alright don't really need it for anything right now but it's good to know it's cool ah okay so it looks like there's not maybe I'm just not seeing it but looks like there's not really a component for for a footer I mean the closest thing I'm seeing is bottom nav so I mean the bottom nav would at least have the behavior that I want of being an element on the page that would always stay at the bottom so maybe maybe I can try putting this in and then just editing it maybe I could start with this and then edit it to look more like I would want to footer to look like I mean really I don't I don't absolutely need a footer but it would make it more consistent with all the other sites that I do for the University if I have a standard footer let's see all right so let's just let's put in the bottom half I don't really care about having these icons right now cuz I'm not gonna use them I just need actually I'm not even sure if I want to give it a death I'm gonna see maybe this will work if I get rid of these icons nope let's get rid of these let's put something in here mmhmm oh there we go and you can see that all right that's definitely not the behavior that I want I must be missing something let me check the chat really quick and see Rohan hey Rohan how's it going you haven't really missed that much we just got our like side navigation drawer working basically you missed me like making silly mistakes for about a half an hour it looks like some we have in the live chat some people talking about like what they're doing with free code camp so we have a few people working on the tribute page and the portfolio page and everything so that's really cool I saw someone said the tribute page should be so Zanna says the tribute page should be simple yeah that's just to give some quick advice on that you know with those early projects and free code camp don't worry about trying to get them perfect right away you know just do the make sure that you complete the user you know stories and then move on you'll learn a lot more and you can always come back later and make them better how you want and in the portfolio I'm I actually never completed the portfolio part because I always I always wanted a better portfolio so I always thought well wait and do some cool stuff and then I'll add it in and I never went back in and added it in at least not yet okay all right so I don't see anyone in the lodge chat talking about this but I needed to maybe look at this documentation because at least in the materialized framework you know there was definitely a certain structure that you followed and it made sure that you know the footer stayed at the bottom even if you didn't have any content you know things like that so I'm thinking maybe I'm missing something some wrapper component or something that I should be using here so let me see if there's like something that talks about the layout themes those color I guess I'll start I guess I'm gonna check out one of the examples and I'm also gonna look here okay I can change the theme that's pretty cool okay very cool can customize the colors and everything that's actually awesome I'll probably end up making a standard theme with the university colors then and then I can just reuse that for future projects they're cool all right cool so everything's in inline style okay I'm not definitely not gonna use the builtin color stuff to use the university colors okay so didn't really find the no I didn't actually want webpack I wanted to the example I didn't actually find the info I wanted within this so let's see just wanna see how how they're doing things okay yeah I'm not maybe I'm missing something y'all can fill me in I'm not seeing anything like really special one on there okay okay I see Christian said in the live chat a footer is not part of the material design guidelines that makes sense yeah make sense Sebastian I see your your comment there it says there is no footer in material you I but the material I materialized CSS one is just a grid yeah I'm not I'm not necessarily worried about creating my own footer component what I what I was hoping would be kind of already made is making sure that it stays at the bottom so I just didn't want to have to like do that CSS on my own if I didn't have to but it looks like I will have to which is not really a big deal so what all I have to do is just make guess I make a footer component I don't know at this point maybe I should just move on to something else because I don't I don't absolutely need a footer component I just like to have it but if I were categorizing like what's essential to this project the footer is definitely way down on the list and it's not essential at all so maybe we'll just skip over that and then that'll give me some time to check out how I'm doing that on my other sites that use materialized and I'll probably just take the markup materialized users and convert that to a component and I'll put all the Styles you know right inside the component that's actually not a bad idea anytime something I'm used to using and materialize it's not here I'll just convert that into a component and eventually I'll end up with kind of a hybrid set of components that that can be used for future projects all right so now since I'm not gonna worry about a footer I'm gonna remove let's see the bottom nav and I'm gonna remove move it from here as well and so now we have this we can start to kind of populate how how we want this to look let's uh let's change some of the colors right away just to get that out of the way so since it was looking at this themes let's see I think this is where I've seen it at all right yes I definitely want to override I'm not I'm not gonna use any of these colors this might be a little bit more complicated than I thought I'd assume that it there would be an easier way maybe maybe there is mmmm overthinking this so probably what I could do then is here instead of putting having this variable for the color I can just change the color I just basically put put a hex color if I wanted to or I could you know import colors which may be more properly can you only hear that in the background yeah so my my boss came back from his honeymoon and he has like a minion toy so if you remember what was it was the movie I can't remember what the movie is now you know what I'm talk about there's a movie with Steve Carell did the voice for it Despicable Me that's it so the movie Despicable Me had minions in it and there's like several of the movies and then they did a separate movie for the minions he has this little toy that's a minion that like dances and sings so he just got back yesterday and he's like I keep hearing this it keeps playing it so anyway it looks like I only have a few seconds left on the live stream for Instagram so you can check out the recording if you want I don't even think anybody's watching right now so yeah but if you cared that noise in the background that's what it is it's that's that's hoyes so he even before I got the job here he was I don't know how it started but he had minion decorations and stuff and occasionally would call his workers his minions all over for fun okay I guess I could do this if I go in and edit this color CAS file I'm thinking do I really want to edit it or should I just make another file my only hesitate to edit things directly because what if I want to update later on you know they come up with a new version if I want to just try to pull that in and update it what I guess looking for is a way to do like a sub theme that would remain and still work even if I updated the main the main theme if anybody knows how I could do that please let me know if I can't it's not a big deal let's see I guess I could just look it up hey there we go stackoverflow has how to do how to apply a custom theme in material UI all right so all right so this person on Stack Overflow wrote a custom theme in a separate file okay all right so it seems like I could do it in a separate file and that would work okay I guess we can try that any other any other thoughts of a better way to do this I mean this this seems like a similar issue to what so what we're doing right now okay let's so make a separate file for now I'm just gonna pull in let's just pull in with this other guy did on stackoverflow to give us something to go by I probably won't need to do right now I'm only worried really about the colors so I won't need all of it I could take probably most of it out let's fish my actually actually commit this first time so if you're not familiar with git or using the command line what I what I just did was I checked which files I had changed and then I committed those files I added a message so I actually committed and added at the same time that's with that a.m. flag is added a little commit message and then I pushed those changes up to the repository on github alright now what I want to do is make a new component let's say actually let's call it let's call it that and let's pop in whoops there we go so let's pull this stuff in I don't need the colors I don't think I'll need the color manipulator I'll leave it in for now I'm not worried about Cece and Eric's I'm not gonna change any of this right now so really I'm just worried about the palette okay so let's just try to change the primary color for now let me pull in all right let me show you guys the style guide this actually I had been telling people that I hadn't built anything in react until like spring of this year but I'm pretty sure that I actually built this in December and this is my first react project so this is in react and I think I did use this might be next Seana thing I think I originally tried to do this with create react app and then I wanted to try out next so this might be the version they use next can remember exactly so anyway it was not exactly true that well it's true to say like the first react project that actually went live you know for a client I did in the spring but this one was in December of 2016 and it's not officially live yet so it never it was supposed to be reviewed by some people higher up and that never really happened so it's it's already a bit outdated I've changed some of this but the part that I want is just these these colors so so this is all done with materialised framework but basically you can see what I was trying to do was you know kind of build out a custom version of the materialized theme with all the colors that we use at the University so for now I really just I need this dark green and just got a message from my boss so let me type this on my other screen back to him so I just want to try this out and see if it works so we'll just change the primary color need to put that like that so let's save that and then let's see how how they applied it so obviously this didn't work for them pretty she need to have static child context types and nothing all right so so I'm just trying to read over this and trying to make sense of what was done actually I want to see the the full code so I miss anything so let me see see pretty sure they call it a themed uh yeah a themed ojs right all right not really sure maybe it's been changed too much all right let me check much time okay it I thought I heard it beep alright so time for a little break to go to the live chat so you do want a custom theme it's this may be too much to try to fit in the rest of the stream we'll see we'll do as much as we can all right I'm gonna scroll up a bit and try to catch up then with the live Chad all right so lot going on the live chat but I'm not coming in upon a lot of questions yet so I'm going to keep scrolling and looking Vladimir asks can you suggest some learning paths from HTML CSS JavaScript react.js I would recommend try the free code camp challenges and work through that that's that's a decent foundation to kind of work your way up there's a lot of other good resources as well so I think I mentioned I did a video on my own channel about how I became a frontend developer and I think I mentioned some of the resources I use there so you can check that out the links in the description and I'd like at some point to do a more detailed video on that all the resources but I think free code camp is whilst definitely steer you in the right direction and so John Hanson says starting a new project just installed webpack I'll see where I'll go from there react look so tempting though I still want to use pug and sass jumping into es6 as well with babel that's a lot of change all at once so yeah you can still use sass with react I know there are ways to do it I I haven't done it but plug I don't know does anybody use plug with with react like would that even make sense I'm I definitely see why it would be it would be hard to switch if you're used to that yeah I agree Patrick says react is not your es6 is not hard to pick up web pack is a pain though I agree web package was at least for me it's difficult I think web pack is great but it's just difficult you know if you if you're not used to it it's really like a steep learning curve Dixie says nervous about making my tribute page any tips on how to not look at the source code and trusting my knowledge yeah I mean I guess you just got to resist that temptation to look at the source code and I would say don't the tribute page is a really really basic type of thing so you know work through don't don't get really nervous thinking it has to be perfect or everything just worry about meeting those user stories those requirements just the basics and then once you met those you know like hey like you've completed the project and then anything else you do on top of that is great but at least you got to that point where it's complete and I had a similar thing happen earlier so on my lunch break I was doing some work on my react course and the first project I had gotten to the point where I had fulfilled all the requirements but I didn't really do a lot of customizations and I thought about it and I really wanted to do customizations but I thought you know what I fulfilled it like I need to just turn this in and move on and learn more instead of worrying about trying to make it you know really really good and perfect so that's what I did so I just turned it in and it would be really cool if I had made it unique but you only only have so much time you know it was better you know to move on and continue learning than to wait and wait and get backed up and maybe never get to some of the later stuff in the course all right let me do scroll through a bit more NDM says how did you start learning react hey Andy and he also has a YouTube channel where he does live streams so you can check that out how did I start I think I started with just reading over the react documentation trying to get a hold of that and then I I did the course from code Academy and watched a bunch of YouTube videos that was like my very beginning and create react app then came out after so I think I had started trying to learn it before that came out when that came out it was cool when it was really helpful and then when next j/s started to get so when next Jess first started out it wasn't a lot of the features they have now they didn't have so it was okay but not nearly as good as it is now so as they added features then it started getting really fun to work with with next okay Galaxy Tab asks when building react project using Mac what software do I use yeah you just need a code editor I mean really I mean you need note okay it looks like Patrick Patrick answer it says whatever editor you want you also need node and NPM so that's cool galaxy says you don't need Xcode or Visual Studio yeah you don't need any of that alright I'm almost at the bottom Elijah that's why I'm kind of going everytime a little bit cuz it's just so tempting to get to the bottom John says John Samoa we have several John's that are in here so I have to start using the full name but Johnson Buddha says Jessie you rock more commits all sub slash viewers should submit pull requests and help him out that he can review offline oh well thanks for saying that that's cool yeah I totally don't expect you all to you know help help out so um I'll do this no matter what as long as I think it's helpful to you but yeah if you if you have if you have the time and you want to work on it and submit some pull requests um that's awesome of course like I can't guarantee that every pull request is going to make it in sometimes there are really good things that don't make it in just because I don't have time have to move on so it's not even necessarily because like I didn't like what you've done I might really like it and just don't have time to pull it in but yeah if anyway I appreciate you saying that okay all right so I'm pretty much to the bottom of the chat right now I'll come back to it in a bit all right so let's go this will probably be my last see what time it is yeah this will be my last Pomodoro session before we do questions and so I want to try to be done around for today is I think I mentioned it yesterday maybe I didn't all right I don't think I mention it so today is my wife's birthday and my my son's birthday so they they share a birthday so I want to get home at a decent time so that I can celebrate their birthday and then tomorrow is my other son's birthday so we've got like you know birthday weekend happening here all right so what were we working on we're trying to apply this theme right yes all right so I'm gonna move this over to my other screen for a second and I'm gonna come back here and look at I want to look at the actual documentation and compare it to what the this person was going on stackoverflow so this is asked by nose not much on Sakura flow okay that's good to know I didn't see that before it says never directly and you take the theme okay cool this this looks like I can do is just some basic manipulation of the theme just to try it out at first like this okay that works I don't know why but when I read this before it didn't make sense to me but then after after looking at again now it makes sense I guess that's out is it happens frequently maybe my my brain just needed to work on that subconsciously while I was doing other things to get it so so I'll probably end up putting some stuff in a separate file at first so I'm not going to delete this or anything I'll just leave it for now but I think really what I need to do is where I have is this theme provider I can add in this copy and paste this and and let me take that that color where did I have that that primary color I figured that was to take the whole thing primary cover okay now let's see what that does oops is not defined no undefined all right what am I doing wrong this is not fun uh maybe I did I'm not I didn't put this in cool check it out all right so our primary color which I suspected the primary color changed the title bark is that that made sense so I did cool and I think it shrunk did that are tired boy get smaller or at this calling app bar so material UI closes the app bar cool alright so now potentially if I want to I could use a separate file if I end up customizing a lot or if I don't I could I could just leave this in here if I'm only gonna customize a few things cool it's nice when things work oh cool I see if a lot of you saying happy birthday for my wife and both of my son's birthdays so thanks I'll let them know that you all said happy birthday sometimes like all my kids I'll say like occasionally if you all tell me to like tell my family or my kids something I'll say like everybody on YouTube said this and they kind of look at me like what's weird look the oh no I'm sorry I just got distracted I so I did the video on Instagram and I waited way too long to hit the share button and so now I couldn't share it so that's too bad I'll have to remember next time Tana looks like my wife posted a video on Instagram of my son Ambrose blowing out candles on a cupcake that's cool now now I wish I was home all right so let's so ace we have the color we can change our theme what's our secondary color gonna be probably the gold it's it's gonna be the gold or do we go think actually I might go with where so that the style guide I might go with this yellow I'm gonna see how this primary primary color okay now okay I think I want the yellow to be the accent color primary color maybe it'll be cold it probably won't really make any sense to change these yet because I don't have any elements on the page where I could see what it would do so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do anything more with this until we build this out a little bit more actually what we'll probably do is we might not even have this title or this app bar be green I know it's like not exactly in line with the material design specs but I've been doing this a little bit differently lately where I have a white app bar with a thin gold border underneath and then we have a logo that's that uses the green and the gold colors that shows up nicely on the white so I might end up one with that too because my boss really likes that it looks nice it looks very nice it's clean so that might change but for now at least if we figured out how to change the theme colors so what we need now is to figure out our our basic layout let me see how much time I have left okay 15 minutes all right so we need to figure out kind of like the basic layout that we're going to use and in case you you either didn't see or don't remember I'll bring over what we're going from and where did I put that I don't know where I put that so I'll just type it again all right so here's what here's what it currently looks like and I'm not gonna try to mimic this exactly but basically I need what I need is for users to be able to get to any section of this site immediately when the page loads so I don't want a long scrolling page so that's pretty much the only requirement for the the first screen that users see so I mean this works I could try to just mimic this what do y'all think let me know let me know what you think about maybe keeping this there's something similar okay so Patrick says plus one for the current layout yeah I my initial thought yesterday was to like change it but now that I look at it it's not I mean it works it's I don't really know what I would do that would be better to direct users to the different parts of the site okay cool looks I guess and get some more votes Rud Rud rank rank Shu Nandi sorry if I mess up the pronunciation for your name says make something out of the box I I would love to make something out of the box but I do have to keep the users in mind and in this case my users it's probably good to go over the who the users are for this with you all cuz I don't think I've done this yet my users are this is going to be an internal site for university employees and that includes a lot of people who are older professors who don't really use technology very much at all so I mean we're talking about like people like they don't have smartphones they want everything printed out there so I have to keep that user basin in mind so I mean there's the majority of people or like somewhat ok with using computers but there's definitely a group on campus that it needs to be very very straightforward so with that in mind then we you know we'll go forward with this so it seems like let's let's just try to keep this layout so basically we just need columns we need three column layout two rows how to I don't even remember how this looks ok so then it just goes yeah so we just need to set up two break points and I have no idea how the break points and the grid system works in material UI so let's check that out is that okay grid okay cool so I guess this is similar to what I need so say this is a grid list I'm wondering is there a layout something more than I'm missing here so it wouldn't even it wouldn't necessarily be a component I don't know yeah I don't think the grid list is what I'm really looking for I'm wondering now this material UI then does it not come with a like a system of columns actually if if it is the case that it doesn't come with a system of columns I'm wondering if I can just pull out then the whole black column system from materialise and use it use it here all right okay Christian said I might have to new use the newer version I'm buried this is an enumerative also we're back to this so it yesterday I originally had this version installed and then I switched and installed the new version and then I was advised to not use the new version since it wasn't really ready yet and so I switched it back to the old version I let me I'm not I don't think I'm gonna switch over but I just want to see it I wanna see what it's like it yeah this actually is exactly what I want I don't know I don't know everyone I really kind of want to switch now yeah all right now and now everybody's saying switch Maxie me I don't think I can't use get get revert of revert anyway I changed too many things I think yeah I'm like I might switch back let me check really quick because I know you all told me yesterday that there were some components that I couldn't use because they weren't ready with this one man I just like how close is this to being done like are we talking like a year until it's released or I can't I really want to I don't want to know I didn't see anything talking about a time line all right let's see what components who we are all right we have the app bar right that's that standard let's see what an e be a bar for sure I don't care about the bottom nerve right now I'll need cards which that should like that standard I need form elements let's see what the form that that might be the deal breaker so we have text fields where's my okay cool I like using the ones where the label pops out all right awesome so we got a text fields we need select with a Canadian column select they were dropdowns right do we not have dropdowns okay here's some checkboxes it's good actually I'm not I don't really like that as much as the way materialized doesn't I might have to modify that component because I really like the way materialized of it cool all right I'll I I do like that switches okay so menus so basically text field select menus coming soon all right so they don't have that this should work though for what I needed to do just like a regular menu as long as I can just get the value of whatever is clicked on which shouldn't be a problem then all right cool um I think that this version actually does have everything that I need so maybe we'll go with it all right I know it looks like some of the people that were really against me using the the latest version of this are not here right now so so they're not here to tell me not to do it Oh Maxie man I know I know it was a joke about the river it was just I was just reading it out ok Johnson muta says you know you'll be upgrading later might as well do it now Christian says feels pretty stable finished to me smack says I always wondered how long it takes to make a legit web app by yourself it's I suppose it takes a long time if you keep switching your your framework back and forth every day okay John smoother says it could fork it KB and says look at the roadmap oh okay cool am I missing the roadmap then what is that oh this has support for some CSS and J's that's cool I like that better than having to do all inline stuff so it's another plus okay Kevin as linked ok so there's some issues check out the github okay cool this is super helpful thank you thank you for this link also my timer went off so the the rest of this is until I'd like to end around 4 o'clock so I'll try to get as many questions answered as I can and if I don't get to your question just send it to me on Twitter or put it in the comments below if you were just here for the code thank you so much for watching and for for helping me out and I'll be back next week alright so let me look just quickly at this hmm this is as of all right so this was edited six months ago so I assume it's better now yes it looks like maybe this list is not maybe it's not up to date is there's a new section now in the docs let's see all right let's check the docks then I said they added it but I don't remember seeing that oh yeah there it is haha I can't believe I miss that cool to say don't support multiline text fields it can't be that hard to apply the same styles to a multiline text field as you can to a single line so assuming this list is uptodate this is probably one that might be able to do a pull request for and get that updated okay let me go to the live chat now I'm gonna scroll up a bit and try to answer as many questions as I can right now I'm thinking that I'm I'm gonna switch and if they don't have something that we need we will add it and potentially submit a pull request and contribute to this project so like I mentioned yesterday I've actually been wanting to either do something like this on my own or contribute to one so I think I found a decent one to contribute to okay Sorrenti so sss r NT y s is react hard I don't know I think something being hard or not is really relative questions so react doesn't seem that hard to me now but when I first started it did seem really hard so I mean just like anything you know practice at it and keep at it and you'll be I mean a year ago I was just hearing about react you know now I'm able to actually build things with react at work so you know in less than a year you can get to a point where you could you could be getting paid to make react stuff let's see Christian as you mentioned earlier the discount at udacity would you recommend it to learn react where would you place it in relation to free code camp okay that's actually a really good question so for me this is how I've used free code camp and Udacity so this is going to be pretty specific to me but there might be some other people in similar position than I am so free code camp is really easy to just go in and do really quick things especially like in the browser just go in and do the exercises and spend like a few minutes a day just doing something just to you know just to keep things fresh in your mind so for me I used it like that that's where I would come in like before I started work I would do one challenge from free code camp now there are like projects that you can't just do in a couple minutes but a lot of the challenges you could finish in a few minutes so that's how I would use it and just do it just a little bit every day for Udacity it's it's set up as these large courses a lot of them are free which is really cool but I was less able to just do things so some of the courses do have in browser exercises but a lot of them require you to set up your development environment so those were more like if I had a an hour to work on something then I could do that so and and those were also sometimes really specific to something that I wanted to learn you know so they're broken up into these courses so if I really wanted to focus on one thing I could do that and be done with that course free code campus is more like just a linear progression all the way through it's a little bit harder to just pick and choose things because it builds so anyway so I use them both at the same time and it was simply a matter of I tried to do a little bit from free code camp every day and if I had a few minutes it was free code camp if I had some specific topic that I really wanted to go like in more depth with I would use Udacity and I would have to set aside more time to do it the majority of what I've done from Udacity has been all their free stuff this react course that I'm taking now is the first time I've actually paid for they call them nano degrees from Udacity so so far I've been happy with it but there's more than enough free content on Udacity that you could learn a lot without paying for anything so hopefully that helps hopefully answer your question okay Johnson mood has had just made it over from another live coding session at treehouse cool I didn't realize treehouse had live coding I'll have to often check that out is the treehouse live coding is it free or is it something that you have to pay for so I know some of their stuff is paid and they do offer some free things John also said thank you for the live work you're welcome thanks for watching adventurous programmers said I use Stephen Ritter's webpack course on udemy for ten dollars to learn web pack to made it easy that's really good to know thanks for sharing that so if anybody's trying to learn web pack check out udemy Stephen Stephen graders web pack course so yeah again thanks for that okay ooh brain shoo Nandi says you he provided a link to where you could use pug with react so it's if there's a babble plugin to use plug with react so if you check out the the pug repo on github it looks like it's in there so thanks for sharing that that battery con says I am just I'm just a beginner but my friend said JavaScript is very complex and hard to learn is this true I don't I don't know if it's I don't really think JavaScript is that complex and hard to learn but you know i've i've been using javascript for years so it's i guess it's hard to remember what it was like at the beginning learning so I would say like if you're thinking about learning it go for it you know there's you're not really risking anything by trying it you'll find out soon whether or not you think it's too complicated but I mean I I don't think like a lot of people learn it you know you know average people of average intelligence learn it so I don't think it's you know that difficult John says John Hanson says it's odd to see you code react here as pug as much of the same sort of thing as component building they're just the HTML it uses JavaScript feels very logical to me the reactant yeah yeah definitely reactives does remind me a bit of different like templating different ways to do templating so yeah it shouldn't it shouldn't be that much of a jump to move to react from something else like pug or I guess even you can think of like handlebars or something like that hey Jordan how's it going Jordan said hi okay so Patrick said earlier let me put this up on the screen Patrick really dislikes that I was doing this in index J s and thought I should be doing it an app j s so okay so that's cool I mean that will not be a problem to move that over so I mean I'm not gonna do it right now but basically you know she lets you know what I would do it'd be as simple as removing kind of this out of here and then wrapping it wrapping app in this so it would have the same the same effect I'm assuming I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work Kevin asked this register serviceworker come with create react app yes it did I didn't add that in that came by default Zanna said I don't quite get it what is supposed to be that white space under there so yeah I think I assumed you were talking about this all this white space yeah that was probably just I had the idea that I wanted this overlap up here so yeah it's always gonna have this white space probably what I'll end up doing is vertically centering this if I redo it because I'm not gonna have this giant header so everything would be vertically centered so there would still be a lot of white space but it would be at least evenly distributed okay cool and I just read Roe on your comment about moving the grid towards the bottom and so yeah that's exactly what I intend to do Zanna says I suggest you make an accessibility audit yeah that's that's actually a good idea I'm actually really conscious of helping people who are blind or have vision impairments being able to go through the site so we do have one professor who's blind and so I want to make sure that she can in all the sites that I do I really do want to make sure that she can you know see it be able to use a screen reader for everything so when I initially made this I'm not sure that I I kept that in mind as much as I should but I definitely want to this time so I'm gonna have to look up some more with it as well because I'm sure there's some stuff that I could be doing that I'm not also I have an uncle that's blind so I'm always like what I'm doing sites I'm always thinking like would he even be able to use this site so so thanks for bringing that up s and i definitely it's definitely something i want to keep in mind as I'm building it I'm just reading all the messages that you all had about me switching to the newer version of material UI so it seems like the messages now are just excited for going for it as they were yesterday about not going for it I mean to be fair there are different people in here today a lot of different people than there were yesterday so so it's not like everybody's changing them I'm changing my mind but not I don't know that you all are changing master mine says hello sir what's HTML Java JavaScript and CSS alright that's that's like a really big question let me try to give a very like succinct answer so I'm not going to talk about Java Java is a programming language computer programming language that I'm not very familiar with so I'm gonna leave that out now but things like Android apps are built with Java but as far as HTML Javascript and CSS those are the languages that websites are built from so the HTML would be gives the structure to the page the javascript helps with interactivity so things moving around on the page data being sent to different places and then the CSS is the style of the page you know the colors the fonts things like that so I guess as an analogy if you were building a house the HTML would be the frame of the house the CSS would be all the decorations and then the JavaScript would be like all the electricity running through the house and the plumbing that makes the water flow and the lights turn on and you know things like that not really a perfect analogy but I think it works well enough oh cool Christian says I had mentioned earlier based on the documentation I was looking at that they didn't support multiline text fields but Christian says they do support it and Christian is using those multiline text fields so good to know so evidently that documentation is not updated so I'll just have to see for myself and you know what's available what's not and not rely on that documentation okay Patrick says has pasted in some content from the material UI roadmap okay there's the Reb map dot M D off to check out that file later but it says first both versions can be used at the same time people can progressively migrate one component at a time that's really cool okay that's something I'll have to think about maybe I don't have to completely switch maybe I can just pull in some of the components that I need so that's really cool that must mean that they're actually really compatible if you can just pull in a component when you need it that's good to know Christian asks what will the back end be for your application I guess in it like in terms of like the back end it's just going to be I'm not exactly sure what you're asking so I'll just give you a basic idea of like the whole stack so I mean I'm gonna run it obviously with node and Express and then the data there's not I'm not really dealing with a lot of data so I'm gonna send data to a project management system called Reich and then I'm gonna email it out as well I haven't decided yet if I'm actually gonna try to save data in a database it might be cool to do that so it may depending on how long this takes I may have time to try to do something like that but I'm not super familiar with how to set up databases so so anyway that's it's it's not going to be really complex a complex site okay cool Patrick says I was always on Team go for it awesome this is I think the last comment so this would be the last question that I am that I answer for today and it's from pear cake so pear cake says hi Jessie can you give an advice where I can find good app specs that I can read and implement in a fairly big react app I'm not very good at imagining apps for practice hmm I don't know so I'm guessing let me know if I'm wrong on this but base like you're asking for ideas for large apps that you can make I know I don't know what the websites are it's been so long since I've been on them but I know there are some sites that just give a ton of ideas for for apps so people just you know offer their ideas and you can you can work on them so try to look up something like that I just I'm sorry I just I can't remember at all with the name of the these even even one of those sites were and I'm pretty sure there's several different ones so I would check out something like that otherwise like you could you know try asking colleagues or you know friends family for their ideas about things so I'm somewhat similar situation that I don't I don't exactly have a lot of ideas on my own it's hard to come up with them alright okay cool christian said ideas watch.com slash startup ideas slash app so cool Thank You Christian alright so patrick says go celebrate with your family so and he says thanks for stream you welcome and i'm definitely going to do that right now so thank you all so much for watching and for all of your help it's day and didn't get a lot done in terms of what's on the screen but I think we I have a much better understanding of material UI so I think it was it was a good day for learning so yeah so Co on Monday and have a great weekend
