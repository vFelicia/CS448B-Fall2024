With timestamps:

00:07 - hey everybody its Jesse and today I'm
00:13 - just trying to get more done a lot of
00:15 - the same thing is yesterday but I did
00:19 - notice as I was going back through a lot
00:21 - of these components that they could use
00:23 - with a little bit of refactoring so
00:25 - there are some some changes that we made
00:29 - the components later on that were
00:31 - beneficial that I never went back and
00:34 - made those same changes some of the
00:37 - components that were made earlier so I
00:42 - am I'm going to go through and I was
00:48 - just adding an image in here just
00:50 - putting in some some content to test out
00:55 - a new component I just made so share the
00:58 - component in a second
01:11 - and let me check the I'm gonna check the
01:17 - live chat here we go I lost my my window
01:22 - for the live chat so hey everyone
01:26 - hairy ass what is react react is like a
01:30 - JavaScript framework it lets you build
01:35 - web apps and you can build other things
01:39 - with it too but it's it would be hard to
01:45 - sum up on a video but just that the very
01:50 - short answer is it's a JavaScript
01:52 - framework and it lets you build websites
01:56 - web apps and actually you can even build
01:59 - mobile apps and desktop apps very
02:04 - versatile and actually I think I saw a
02:06 - talk at a conference that recorded talk
02:10 - on YouTube about using react to build VR
02:14 - things which is really cool I don't
02:18 - really know how to how to do that but I
02:20 - know people are doing it so hey everyone
02:25 - alright so I see alright so you got a
02:27 - bunch of people in the chat now and hey
02:32 - Thor how's it going I haven't seen you
02:34 - know uh
02:40 - I Fernando from Argentina hey thanks for
02:46 - thanks for watching from Argentina
02:49 - actually there's a conference coming up
02:50 - in Argentina that I'm going to submit a
02:53 - talk for so actually I filled out
02:57 - everything I needed to submit it and
02:58 - then I got to the end and it asked for a
03:01 - video explaining you know a few minutes
03:05 - just explaining more about the talk and
03:08 - I couldn't do the video at the time cuz
03:11 - I was no it was up late all my kids were
03:15 - sleeping I didn't want to wake them up
03:18 - by making a video so hopefully I'll get
03:22 - some time to make that video and I can
03:24 - apply it would be really cool I've never
03:27 - never been to Argentina before
03:41 - if someone in the live chat whose name
03:44 - is an solo so like Han Solo but without
03:48 - the age and their avatar is a fixture of
03:52 - Han Solo so that's pretty cool alright
04:00 - so I got some questions in the live chat
04:05 - I guess I'll just answer them now before
04:09 - we we get started with some of the code
04:11 - and I'll throw some code up on the
04:14 - screen just you can see what I've been
04:16 - working on this is the new component on
04:20 - this side and it's doing a lot of stuff
04:24 - I have I did push this up to github so
04:29 - if you want to check out the code in
04:31 - more depth it's on the dev branch on
04:35 - github
04:36 - but let me just check out few questions
04:45 - I've epic asked how I load data in page
04:50 - load and react tree Redux I actually
04:53 - haven't used redux for anything so I
04:56 - can't I can't be of much help to you I'm
05:00 - taking a course right now and I'm gonna
05:02 - learn more about redux so maybe in
05:06 - another month or two I'll be able to
05:07 - answer that question but right now I'm
05:10 - just not experienced with it so I know
05:15 - how to load data on page load without
05:18 - Redux and actually you can you see will
05:22 - be will be doing some of that probably
05:24 - during today's stream so I don't know if
05:28 - that'll be helpful to you but if so you
05:31 - stick around
05:46 - well Patrick says there's even a way to
05:50 - developed command-line interfaces with
05:52 - react that's really cool I didn't
05:55 - realize that ek Howard asks I'm
06:00 - attending a coding bootcamp
06:02 - and I have to choose between react and
06:04 - Rails which one well it kind of depends
06:09 - on what you want to do but I'm I'm
06:12 - partial to react since I'm using it on a
06:15 - project now and react seems to be
06:17 - growing and there's a lot of jobs for
06:19 - react I don't know the numbers
06:20 - officially on Rails job sources react
06:23 - jobs but it seems like the momentum
06:25 - right now is at least with react so if
06:28 - your goal is to try to be marketable
06:30 - then reacts a really good skill to pick
06:33 - up you can vote a lot of stuff with it I
06:36 - don't have any experience at all and
06:38 - working with rails so I can't really
06:42 - give you great advice since I only know
06:45 - about react but actually correct me if
06:47 - I'm wrong is rails is more would Rails
06:52 - be more back-end isn't that Ruby right
06:56 - is it and react would not normally be a
07:03 - back-end type of thing I don't know
07:06 - maybe I'm wrong like I said I don't know
07:08 - very much at all about Rails so so
07:13 - definitely don't take my word for it
07:15 - okay so it looks like okay I was right
07:18 - so rails is back-end so there you get so
07:21 - that's probably the best criteria is
07:24 - would you rather learn front-end stuff
07:27 - or back-end so
07:34 - I guess it would depend on your goals
07:36 - like do you want to be a back-end
07:37 - programmer or a full-stack or do you
07:39 - want to stick with front-end so that's
07:44 - that's what I would say I would also say
07:47 - to you know if you're gonna do the react
07:50 - boot camp then your JavaScript skills
07:54 - will get a lot better and that can
07:57 - translate into a lot of different things
07:58 - not just react so I know my JavaScript
08:01 - skills have gotten way better since I
08:03 - started doing things with react whereas
08:05 - before I was doing a lot of things with
08:07 - jQuery which jQuery is nice especially
08:09 - when you're starting out but if you if
08:14 - you want to be able to easily switch
08:15 - between different JavaScript frameworks
08:17 - knowing basic JavaScript is the best
08:19 - thing so it has really helped me
08:31 - okay all right so I think I got all the
08:35 - all the initial questions here in the
08:38 - live chat so yesterday I tried out a new
08:42 - system here where I used a Pomodoro
08:45 - timer to remind me to check the live
08:50 - chat and then also remind me to stop
08:52 - talking and do some more code so I'm
08:55 - going to do that again today I'm gonna
08:57 - start it as soon as I kind of catch you
08:59 - all up on what I've been doing
09:02 - also I I did a stream earlier today on
09:08 - my own channel so I had a suggestion so
09:13 - XANA who's not in the live chat yeah I
09:19 - don't see you in the live chat so maybe
09:20 - she's not watching right now but she had
09:23 - this suggestion to do just streams where
09:28 - I didn't have to worry about doing
09:30 - commentary or anything but I would just
09:32 - show what's on my screen and what I'm
09:34 - working on I had never thought about
09:36 - doing that before so I thought it was
09:39 - worth a shot and so I did so earlier
09:43 - today for about an hour I just showed
09:45 - what was on my screen I did it on my own
09:47 - YouTube channel because I wasn't sure I
09:50 - mean when I was invited to do the
09:53 - channel on free code or the show on free
09:56 - code camp it was based on what I
09:58 - normally do which is a commentary
10:00 - question and answer and that kind of
10:02 - thing so I didn't want to just switch
10:04 - things up and start broadcasting on free
10:06 - code camp without you know kind of
10:09 - checking with them first so it was a
10:10 - little bit spur-of-the-moment so that's
10:12 - why I just put it on my own channel so
10:14 - if you're interested in want to check it
10:16 - out there is a recording of it I'm I
10:19 - think I'm gonna call the series quiet
10:24 - coding so I'll probably have like a
10:27 - playlist on my channel about all my
10:29 - quiet coding stuff so earlier I was just
10:31 - doing a lot of like refactoring every
10:34 - acts of pulling in data from the
10:37 - WordPress API a lot of the same stuff I
10:40 - was doing yesterday so I'll probably I
10:43 - kind of like doing it
10:45 - had my my microphone muted so I didn't
10:51 - really have to worry if somebody came in
10:52 - my office tried to take a phone call or
10:54 - something I just I could just do it and
10:56 - didn't it wasn't really a big deal so
10:59 - not sure if anybody's interested but
11:02 - just one of the less you know since did
11:04 - you all gave me the idea for it I want
11:05 - to let you know that I did try it out
11:06 - and I don't think I'm just trying to
11:14 - think if there's any other big things
11:16 - that happen between yesterday and today
11:18 - and I don't really think so so I'll show
11:28 - you what I'm working on right now I'm
11:30 - just gonna kind of continue on whoops
11:32 - let me start my start my timer here so I
11:38 - I was continuing to try to pull in all
11:47 - the data from WordPress into our react
11:55 - react site or at least as much as I
11:59 - possibly could so that it can be
12:01 - editable within WordPress and nobody has
12:05 - to touch the code so I went through the
12:10 - let me just bring that pull the site
12:12 - over here so I went through some of the
12:18 - pages finished we had done the about
12:21 - page already yesterday so I went through
12:24 - the team page and then now I'm on the
12:26 - courses page and I'm just pulling in the
12:30 - data so what I did have to do on this
12:34 - courses page is make some custom post
12:37 - type so this section and this section
12:39 - these are just normal like pages within
12:42 - WordPress so exactly the same as we have
12:44 - been doing yesterday with some things
12:47 - this little section here is just a page
12:49 - but when we get down to here this now is
12:54 - a custom post type so before the click
12:57 - handler was
12:59 - was actually changing a CSS property to
13:03 - show and hide this now it's it's not the
13:07 - click handler is changing the state and
13:11 - I'll show you in a second and it's
13:14 - showing or hiding based on that database
13:17 - on that so it's our you know three
13:18 - rendering the component so if that
13:21 - doesn't make sense now it'll make sense
13:22 - in a second when I show you the code so
13:26 - these sections and I guess I should
13:29 - bring I have the live set over let me
13:33 - bring this over to show you what it did
13:35 - look like so these sections have images
13:39 - and they have these links these sections
13:42 - don't they're just text but they're
13:46 - similar enough that I thought it's worth
13:49 - a try to try to make one component that
13:51 - could handle all these variations
13:54 - depending on what data gets passed in so
13:57 - that was that was the goal I wanted I
13:59 - wanted one component for all of these
14:02 - things and potentially I suppose the
14:08 - same component could be used elsewhere
14:10 - if we ever add pages on so here's what I
14:16 - came up with so I made a component
14:22 - called expanding section and I it it has
14:29 - its own state and it's simply just
14:32 - display content true or false so really
14:35 - easy but then I have all these you know
14:42 - if that we're not really if statements
14:43 - properly is that you know ternary you
14:47 - know operators but basically I'm
14:51 - checking to see if data is there so the
14:53 - first thing I check for so every section
14:56 - is going to start out and that be
14:57 - wrapped in this subsection div right but
15:00 - the first thing I do right off the bat
15:02 - is check if there's an image so if
15:05 - someone in WordPress has uploaded a
15:07 - featured image to that post
15:10 - then it's going to render this okay
15:13 - which is the template that handles
15:17 - images also once we get down to once we
15:27 - get down to here so you could you see
15:29 - from from this part here just handles
15:31 - that first part this you know this title
15:36 - once we get down to here this is where
15:39 - we show our high based on our state so
15:42 - if state is true then we showed this
15:47 - part within this part I also have a
15:51 - section for this link so we're using
15:53 - that out link component that helps us
15:56 - track so if you remember we we were
15:59 - using react what was a react GA so the
16:05 - google analytics plugin for react and
16:08 - there was a there was a problem with it
16:11 - and that it didn't really work properly
16:13 - if he wanted to set target --blank to
16:15 - the link so we made our own kind of
16:20 - wrapper element and it fixed that
16:22 - problem and that was the show whenever
16:25 - we actually submitted the pull request
16:28 - which i've never heard back about that
16:30 - so not sure really what happened maybe
16:33 - that project isn't really being
16:34 - maintained I don't know I never checked
16:36 - on it maybe I'll ask about it if I get a
16:38 - chance it's possible that I know I
16:41 - didn't properly follow the the rules for
16:44 - testing so it's possible that maybe when
16:47 - they saw that they just didn't even look
16:49 - at it but we'll see I think it's worth
16:53 - checking up on again because there are
16:55 - other people that had a similar issue so
16:57 - this could be helpful but anyway if
17:01 - there is a URL added in to our custom
17:04 - post type which I thought I had it on
17:09 - the screen maybe I moved it over
17:17 - oh yeah I did so we can see like the URL
17:24 - here so if a URL is entered then this
17:31 - button gets rendered otherwise it does
17:34 - it doesn't so the other variation then
17:38 - is and then of course it displays our
17:42 - image here the other variation is just
17:45 - the text with or without the link okay
17:49 - so there are potentially right now for
17:54 - variations that could happen on this
17:56 - this component so we could have image
18:03 - text and a link we could just have text
18:06 - and image we can just have text or we
18:09 - could have text with a link I'd like to
18:12 - add one more variation because right now
18:15 - we alternate so I need one more
18:20 - variation to just flip these and
18:25 - alternate so this isn't going to be
18:27 - something that the content manager from
18:31 - WordPress picks I could make it another
18:34 - field to set whether it's right or left
18:36 - but I don't really think that that's
18:38 - important I can it's possible maybe that
18:45 - they would want to do it but in general
18:47 - these types of sections look better if
18:49 - it does alternate so I think I'm just
18:51 - gonna make it so that it always
18:52 - alternates and that can't be changed and
18:55 - I'm more comfortable with that then that
18:59 - way I don't have to rely on whoever is
19:01 - changing the content to realize that it
19:03 - looks better
19:04 - you know alternated so that's one less
19:08 - thing for them to worry about and it'll
19:11 - keep the same look that that we wanted
19:13 - with this alternating thing here this
19:18 - woman here actually works at Franciscan
19:20 - she's super super nice everything every
19:23 - web said I do she always says it's
19:24 - really really great and she
19:26 - loves everything I do so anyway most of
19:30 - these pictures in here these aren't like
19:32 - stock photos these are real people from
19:33 - the University which is cool because
19:35 - normally I work a lot with stock photos
19:38 - this is actually a chapel that's on
19:40 - campus it's a replica of one in Italy so
19:44 - anyway a little side note all right so
19:48 - that's it sort of to finish up this
19:50 - component we just want to make these
19:51 - alternate so the good thing is we don't
19:57 - have to make a whole nother section
19:59 - where we change the HTML at least I
20:04 - don't think we do I'm pretty sure that I
20:09 - can just change let me see how I did it
20:15 - because I did do you use some the way I
20:23 - I laid out this grid with the CSS I made
20:27 - some custom classes that can change the
20:29 - order of where these things are so I'm
20:32 - hoping that that's all I'll need to
20:35 - change if if I can't exactly remember I
20:39 - set this up because I set it up months
20:41 - and months ago on a different project
20:42 - and I just carried it over but if it
20:45 - doesn't work like I wanted to then I can
20:48 - just make this component a bit bigger
20:50 - and copy and paste everything over and
20:54 - then we'll make we'll figure it out but
20:56 - for right now I think it'll be it'll be
20:59 - ok we just need to check out so I guess
21:05 - the easiest way to test this would be
21:07 - I'm going to go here we can see now for
21:11 - this one we have text on left image on
21:13 - right so what I want to do is change I
21:19 - don't know if this is gonna work I'm
21:21 - gonna give you shelter I'm gonna change
21:23 - this order I think my order CSS might
21:28 - only work on a small screen now that I
21:33 - think about it yeah it does ok I think I
21:38 - have it so that it only works on small
21:40 - screens screens right now so that the
21:42 - image always ends up being on top so let
21:48 - me just make sure that's still working
21:50 - like that yeah there we go so this only
21:53 - goes like that all right so the solution
21:57 - then I assume that this is like I'm
22:02 - using a media query to make it so that
22:06 - that only applies here trying to think
22:11 - of what the most the best way to make
22:15 - this happen would be
22:23 - I can put off thinking about it for just
22:26 - a second because what we need to do
22:27 - anyway is we need to figure out which
22:39 - basically whether it's odd or even
22:41 - number alright so and this is not hard
22:44 - and we're probably going to need to do
22:45 - it here when we actually I'm sorry not
22:54 - where am I here we go so when we
22:59 - actually set up and and start going
23:04 - through this component this is where we
23:07 - need to do it so we need to we need to
23:12 - get the index number and then pass it
23:18 - probably will pass it as a problem I
23:23 - think that's the best way all right
23:29 - so if you're not sure what I'm talking
23:32 - about right now it'll be obvious in a
23:33 - second when I actually do it so what I
23:36 - need to do now is get the index number
23:46 - and I'm wondering I don't know if I have
23:52 - to put a bracket there now I'm gonna try
23:54 - it without the bracket hopefully I can
23:56 - do it otherwise I'll put a bracket in
23:59 - and now I need to put the index equals I
24:09 - and then let me save that and find out
24:17 - okay no errors that's good and did it
24:22 - render yeah it's still rendered okay
24:25 - great so we're gonna grab the index
24:29 - we're gonna pass it as a prop to our
24:32 - component now within our component let's
24:47 - I'm wondering if I if I ought to put
24:50 - something in state basically all I need
24:57 - to do is be able to tell if this is odd
24:59 - or an even number I don't think there's
25:07 - necessarily any value in putting that in
25:10 - state we're never gonna have a need to
25:12 - change that after the fact all right so
25:23 - I think we can we can change this I
25:24 - don't really need to do anything else
25:26 - with this with this index so let's
25:28 - change it here might be easier now we'll
25:36 - leave it here and then we won't have to
25:39 - rewrite a lot of this logic and really I
25:44 - don't know if we'll do it it might just
25:47 - be a little nitpicky to do this right
25:49 - now but really I should probably put as
25:52 - much of the logic that's going on here
25:55 - into the components and make it easier
25:57 - to put things in but some of it I think
26:01 - I actually do have to do here to avoid
26:04 - getting some error messages but for now
26:07 - let's move this in here and just say
26:13 - let's say is even I don't know that I
26:19 - even really need to make a component for
26:22 - this or I mean it's like a separate
26:26 - function I could probably do it in line
26:28 - but others do it here
26:40 - that's the right syntax right I don't
26:44 - know why I write this so often I don't
26:46 - know why I'm second-guessing it but I
26:48 - guess it's like when you look at a word
26:50 - that you spelled a million times and it
26:52 - just looks weird to you all of a sudden
26:54 - like you spelled it wrong so let's say
27:02 - index this drops index and I'm going to
27:16 - say oops
27:24 - if it equals I always forget I always
27:29 - have to double check what the correct
27:33 - with the true and false values are for
27:36 - the answers so so what is it like if
27:41 - it's 2 modulo the modulus operator and 2
27:47 - we get zero so if it's 3 I'm on my other
27:51 - screen I'm just doing a little bit of
27:52 - math ok so that's how it is so what we
27:55 - want so if it equals zero then we're
28:01 - gonna return true because it is even
28:05 - otherwise oh yeah that's right that
28:09 - makes sense I gave me that I had to do
28:11 - the math to figure that out but
28:16 - sometimes this is this easier to just do
28:20 - the math
28:32 - make sure okay that is gonna come
28:34 - through as a number all right so
28:35 - basically what this is doing if you're
28:37 - not familiar with this operator what
28:39 - this does is give you the remainder of
28:41 - what's left over once if you were to
28:44 - divide this number which is our index
28:46 - number by two the it'll give you the
28:50 - remainder so if it's divisible by two we
28:53 - will have no remainder which is y of 0
28:56 - if it's not divisible by 2 we will have
29:00 - a remainder so that's that's where where
29:03 - all this is coming from and I don't know
29:07 - why I'm getting such weird syntax
29:09 - highlighting did I do something wrong
29:22 - so I'm gonna check my time here and make
29:26 - sure I do check the lodge at oh okay
29:39 - I'm glad I checked the live chat because
29:42 - I'm Berto has just told me correctly
29:47 - that why do I need the true or false
29:50 - couldn't I just do this and it would
29:52 - return true or false I'm better you are
29:56 - correct and also who else Pedro gave
30:00 - that answer as well and and I messed up
30:05 - the arrow function thanks Patrick
30:10 - goodness
30:18 - all right so this is a lot better now
30:31 - oh hey zan is here now Zanna were you
30:36 - here earlier when I was talking about
30:37 - doing the stream earlier based on your
30:40 - idea from like yesterday or maybe was
30:45 - two days ago
30:48 - if not I'll say it again really quickly
31:08 - all right in the in the live chat I'm
31:11 - just gonna read through a bit since I'm
31:15 - I've already kind of paused the bet here
31:19 - John Hanson says I sort of knew a bit of
31:22 - jQuery for about a year then halfway
31:24 - through a project I thought myself your
31:27 - regular JavaScript
31:28 - not bad for sixty never too late to
31:30 - learn yeah that's awesome
31:35 - actually I think I mentioned this before
31:37 - but my dad is 57 I think and he's going
31:42 - to retire this year and I'm trying to
31:44 - convince him to learn a little bit of
31:47 - front-end development and so I'll have
31:50 - to tell them that that it's not it's not
31:55 - too late to learn
32:07 - the Indra has a question how to avoid
32:10 - rear-ending all react tap wind state
32:12 - change and rendering only children so
32:22 - and then there's some clarification
32:27 - Nikola is asking what kind of state are
32:31 - you talking about component internal
32:33 - state or something like Redux andrew
32:36 - says talking about the big app state
32:41 - want to do it without Redux or flux or
32:44 - set state as simple member and passes
32:47 - props to children okay so Nicola says
32:57 - any component that has its props change
32:59 - will rerender itself meaning if your top
33:02 - components props or state changes
33:06 - everything underneath it will rerender
33:19 - okay yeah so I would say without seeing
33:26 - the code Andrew yeah if you could keep
33:29 - if it's possible to have like keep some
33:33 - state you know within a component that
33:35 - would reduce re-rendering everything if
33:38 - you could I'm not really sure I don't
33:43 - know I don't know that I can give you a
33:44 - great answer if it's possible for you to
33:47 - like link to a github repo or something
33:49 - you can like send me a direct message on
33:52 - Twitter or something like that with the
33:54 - link if you don't want to link it in the
33:56 - live chat and then I could try to check
33:57 - it out when I get a chance
34:08 - Gunnar's says hey Jesse hey gunner how's
34:11 - it going thanks for watching okay John
34:18 - Hanson says flex bucket flex block box
34:20 - added a class that can easily change the
34:23 - dome order flex direction row or row
34:25 - reverse so you may not get the toggle
34:32 - left right if the viewer skips one
34:35 - heading
34:46 - all right lift it shake I have to check
34:52 - that out as soon as I get this basically
34:56 - the next step will be whether I want to
34:59 - handle this like with CSS or whether I
35:03 - want to actually make another component
35:10 - so Zanna I just looked at the link that
35:15 - you posted that had pictures of dogs
35:17 - with squishy cheeks oh that's that's uh
35:23 - that's pretty cool made me smile so
35:30 - here's some examples here for you all
35:33 - later watching
35:47 - let me see
35:56 - all right so we had a Cathal asks what
35:59 - theme do you use for Adam I use the SETI
36:02 - theme SETI
36:04 - Oh Sebastian's already answered that
36:09 - sorry I do that all the time you think I
36:12 - would have learned by now to read the
36:14 - next few comments before I answer yeah
36:22 - now I can see that everybody noticed
36:24 - that I messed up my error function
36:27 - before I noticed
36:45 - yeah so this is a Pomodoro so I had a
36:49 - question here in the live chat about the
36:52 - Pomodoro yeah so this is a poem of over
36:55 - timer so what I'm gonna do is use this I
36:58 - use it all the time when I work but I'm
36:59 - gonna use it during the be live streams
37:02 - now to give give me a better idea of
37:04 - just the time when I'm working and also
37:07 - you know every time the timer goes off I
37:10 - will remind me to check the live chat
37:13 - and then after the five minutes is up
37:15 - it'll remind me to go back to coding so
37:18 - I broke off from that a little bit early
37:21 - this time because I suspected that I was
37:25 - doing something wrong anyway so I
37:28 - figured you all would have caught it
37:34 - let's see ok Nicholas but is there a
37:36 - reason you're not setting your initial
37:38 - component state inside the constructor
37:47 - she talks oh I'm not sure
37:49 - are you talking about this component
37:54 - here
38:02 - so oh wait there's a little bit of delay
38:04 - oh wait so Nicola let me know if if I'm
38:08 - in the right spot there also anyway
38:18 - Zanna I think I had asked if you had
38:21 - heard what I said earlier but then I
38:23 - didn't see whether or not you answered
38:25 - me there's a lot of stuff going on so
38:26 - I'll just say it so you had the idea a
38:29 - couple of days ago of me just doing like
38:31 - a quiet stream with I didn't do any
38:33 - commentary but I I just would do my work
38:39 - and you could watch the screen so I
38:43 - actually did that this morning on my own
38:46 - YouTube channel for about an hour and I
38:48 - think it worked out pretty well I didn't
38:50 - have that many people watch it but that
38:52 - was okay because I really liked I didn't
38:55 - I couldn't handle if people were asking
38:57 - questions and stuff because I was just
38:59 - trying to get the work done so anyway I
39:02 - think I'll do that more frequently I
39:05 - think that was that was actually a good
39:06 - idea and I was able to keep my normal
39:09 - workflow and my normal pace it didn't
39:11 - really bother me knowing that the screen
39:14 - was being recorded so so that was a
39:17 - really good idea and I'll do those on my
39:20 - YouTube channel not on free code camp
39:22 - and less like someone from free code
39:25 - camp asked me and says they really want
39:27 - me to do that but otherwise I'm just
39:28 - going to keep doing this this kind of
39:31 - stream for free code camp and then I'll
39:33 - do the quiet stream on my own channel
39:40 - okay Nick alright that makes a lot more
39:42 - sense that one so anyway Nicholas
39:45 - question about the constructor was
39:48 - because he was just joining didn't
39:51 - realize that the component or I'm sorry
40:00 - that that the entire thing was done in
40:03 - in next j/s so
40:11 - let's see alright I think I got through
40:16 - all the questions
40:29 - okay I see Sebastian had me copy and
40:33 - paste something but now I see I'm just
40:36 - gonna I'm going to avoid the potential
40:38 - copy and paste like invisible character
40:40 - errors going on here so I think this is
40:43 - exactly what you had
40:55 - so it's even equal zero this problem and
40:59 - X modulo two equals zero okay so that's
41:09 - cool
41:11 - thanks Sebastian it's always crazy it
41:17 - like never fails that things that you do
41:20 - frequently that work when you're not
41:24 - being watched somehow you seem to mess
41:27 - up when you are was so anyway that's
41:34 - just the way it is all right so we have
41:37 - this now so so now we know whether or
41:41 - not this particular instance of that
41:46 - component is even or odd and okay
41:54 - there's my timer so I will say two I
41:56 - have I have a few things that are like
42:00 - not coding related that I do need to get
42:02 - done before I leave and I have a meeting
42:04 - at 5:00 so I need to make sure that I
42:13 - have enough time before then to do this
42:17 - stuff so actually one of the things that
42:19 - need to get done I can probably do on
42:20 - the stream so I'm just telling you all
42:23 - mostly so that I hear myself say it and
42:26 - I don't forget but if maybe if one of
42:28 - you also remember you can remind me if I
42:30 - forget towards the end of the stream so
42:33 - I need to make sure that I actually
42:36 - changed the links or tomorrow
42:39 - the site is going live that this one
42:42 - links to so I think I I think I have it
42:44 - up here somewhere so it doesn't really
42:49 - matter so the learning management system
42:54 - that this site needs to link to is going
42:57 - to be live tomorrow it's already live
42:59 - right now I don't know if you can log in
43:02 - or sign up for courses yet but at least
43:03 - the homepage works so I'm just going to
43:07 - link to it today so
43:08 - don't have to work on it tomorrow so I
43:11 - need to do that before I leave so I
43:13 - needed to switch to the master branch
43:15 - add the link in the proper place and
43:19 - then push the code to both of our our
43:24 - servers and make sure it works before I
43:28 - leave today the other thing I have to do
43:31 - is get some data to the head of my
43:34 - department so that she can use it for a
43:38 - meeting that she has on Monday which oh
43:40 - I won't be here on Monday I'm gonna take
43:42 - my kids to an amusement park
43:44 - and so no stream on Monday but I will be
43:49 - back Tuesday
43:52 - alright so having haven't gotten that
43:56 - out of the way
44:00 - let's sort this out now so
44:07 - let's see at this point
44:19 - I kind of just want to
44:34 - I kind of want to just put just take
44:37 - just this section because that's all
44:39 - that would really need right just this
44:41 - section and just say like you know if
44:49 - it's if it's even do it this way if it's
44:51 - all do it that way so I will just copy
44:52 - and paste this which kind of stinks
44:54 - because I don't like to repeat it so
44:57 - much the same stuff but I know like John
45:02 - said that you can do this with Flex box
45:04 - but since I haven't done stuff with Flex
45:06 - box like that at least for a while
45:10 - it'll be faster for me to just switch it
45:15 - around so let me do that now so this
45:18 - date display content so if we are
45:22 - displaying content and let's say n is
45:30 - even don't need up front you do this is
45:38 - even right this is even then we're gonna
45:47 - do it this way yeah we want the first
45:51 - one to be like this so because the first
45:53 - one will be zero so that'll give us a
45:57 - zero so that'll register is even okay
46:02 - and then
46:10 - I don't know I can't I don't want to do
46:12 - it like that I'm sure you all realize my
46:16 - my mistake
46:17 - so no cuz I wanted to either display or
46:21 - not display so what I want to do is make
46:23 - another one inside of this one so
46:41 - I always want the image to have order 1
46:46 - so I'm going to go through I don't know
46:50 - if this will give me an error or not but
46:51 - it won't take me that long to try it so
46:57 - someone else will try if is even
47:17 - you do this
47:23 - else
47:31 - why did I just copy that again that was
47:33 - silly
47:34 - I also gonna do this and then I'll
47:37 - simply flip this around so it's really
47:43 - ugly now but it'll all get Auto
47:44 - formatted in a minute oh I was so
47:50 - terrible
47:57 - and I need I swim
48:03 - there you go
48:06 - okay uh based on the highlighting this
48:11 - is looking weird I'm not sure to work
48:12 - but yeah it doesn't work okay Isis she's
48:16 - arrived in closing today
48:34 - yeah I need I don't know that that's
48:42 - gonna work
48:53 - alright I'm gonna check the live site so
48:55 - I'm sure you all have been giving me
48:56 - advice while I'm doing this phone this
49:00 - is this seemed like it would be the
49:03 - fastest way it looks like it's a mess
49:06 - but basically the reason it didn't work
49:09 - is because I now then have adjacent
49:14 - elements that aren't enclosed in one
49:18 - element and you can't do that in react
49:22 - so if I want this to work I either need
49:26 - to wrap this in a div which may or may
49:28 - not mess up the formatting it's worth a
49:30 - shot to try I suppose or I need to go
49:33 - out like another level here and you know
49:37 - do this but I'm not
49:40 - anyway I'll check the live chat see what
49:43 - you all think
49:56 - that's what Susanna's comment about me
49:59 - always being polite okay she said I
50:06 - could just do talking for like 20
50:08 - minutes at the end or after each 20
50:11 - minutes yeah that's what idea I think
50:13 - was to do like after each like big
50:17 - Pomodoro session to then take a few
50:20 - minutes to talk yeah we'll see yeah I'll
50:30 - try it out and see kind of what the best
50:32 - mix is I did I used to have the idea of
50:38 - just waiting until the end to do all the
50:39 - QA but the problem is if there are too
50:42 - many people in the live chat the the
50:44 - questions that they asked at the
50:45 - beginning get they get deleted they're
50:49 - just there's like a limit so I can't see
50:51 - them anymore so then now I take a few
50:54 - times throughout the stream to check
50:56 - questions okay so all right so say this
51:08 - here need some advice here it says says
51:15 - I should I won't be able to please
51:17 - everyone because I always try to talk to
51:19 - everyone so better focus on the
51:20 - questions related on what you do at the
51:22 - moment and answer the others at the end
51:24 - or find a way that works for you yeah
51:27 - you're right that's that does make sense
51:31 - to try I do i do get sidetracked I I try
51:35 - I guess to save some of those questions
51:38 - for the end but I do occasionally get
51:40 - sidetracked and the reason being like
51:42 - especially if I see someone who's new I
51:44 - haven't seen the chat before even if
51:46 - they ask an unrelated question I really
51:48 - do like to answer them before they leave
51:50 - the chat because I want everybody to
51:52 - feel welcome like after for those of you
51:55 - that I see a lot I know you're not gonna
51:56 - get upset if you know I'll wait to
51:59 - answer your question to a little bit
52:00 - later because I mean you understand like
52:03 - I'm trying to actually get some code
52:04 - done as well so anyway that's why I get
52:07 - sidetracked so I kind of
52:09 - feelings about that I do think it would
52:11 - be easier to follow the stream for you
52:13 - all and I would get more work done if I
52:15 - didn't you know take those little those
52:19 - little side trips to talk to people but
52:21 - I also I do think it's important because
52:24 - I mean you never know they somebody some
52:26 - people come on and say I just started to
52:28 - learn how to code yesterday and I don't
52:31 - want them to get discouraged you know
52:32 - when they're you know when they're just
52:35 - starting out I mean oh it could if they
52:39 - feel like they're being ignored and they
52:41 - just started maybe it took a lot of
52:43 - courage for them to pose so anyway maybe
52:45 - I'm thinking too much into it but I
52:47 - would rather I would rather not be the
52:50 - person that is the reason why they quit
52:54 - coding or or just have a bad day so but
53:00 - I'll probably as more and more people
53:02 - watch this and chat I probably will have
53:05 - to come up with a better way to make
53:07 - sure that I stick to things because
53:08 - they'll just be way too many questions
53:10 - maybe I'll have to get like a moderator
53:13 - or something in the chat and they'll
53:15 - pick out the questions or something
53:33 - okay so John has an idea this is back to
53:37 - being related about to our problem at
53:39 - hand John says could you use an event
53:42 - listener on click to those headings and
53:45 - then toggle like flip the order based on
53:50 - that okay so I don't I don't actually
54:05 - think we need to to change it on click
54:17 - no I don't think we need to because we
54:20 - still it would basically be the same the
54:23 - same problem either way we just need to
54:26 - have like just a slight variation here
54:30 - another set so whether or not we're just
54:33 - checking for even or odd or were we're
54:37 - adding in a click there I think if we
54:40 - added the click we would still need to
54:43 - know whether it's even or odd am I
54:47 - missing something
54:49 - am I missing some reason why we should
54:52 - have a click handler involved in this as
54:55 - well so let me know class thing and I'm
55:02 - getting I'm getting distracted again in
55:04 - the live chat a Sebastian just talked
55:06 - about the YouTube dark theme yeah if you
55:08 - haven't tried out the dark theme on
55:10 - YouTube try it out so you got you all
55:13 - know that I am a fan of the dark theme
55:15 - so I really like it I have found that I
55:21 - did have some things that just weren't
55:23 - working right because it's a newer UI
55:25 - and everything so I did switch back to
55:28 - the
55:29 - the light theme because I couldn't like
55:32 - respond to comments on videos for some
55:36 - reason so it's probably fixed now
55:42 - alright so here's what I'm gonna try I'm
55:47 - just gonna wrap this in a div hopefully
55:52 - this won't mess things up I'm just I'm
55:55 - worried that it'll mess up or something
55:57 - with the knee of the column classes and
56:00 - like the grid system and with
56:02 - materialise but I think it's worth a try
56:09 - so we do a div here and then what do we
56:15 - need
56:25 - hmmm I think I messed up somewhere and
56:31 - pasting yeah I did
56:42 - okay yeah I did myself because that
56:44 - should not be there and then yeah so
56:50 - this this is the right spot no is it no
56:58 - it's not alright I'm gonna I got to
57:04 - think for a second so I can figure out
57:06 - what how I mess these divs up all right
57:13 - so this all right goes all the way up
57:18 - here with that so then we need a div
57:23 - inside directly inside this one
57:31 - right
57:37 - yeah okay so we do need a div that's
57:41 - gonna be I guess here
57:53 - this will need that death we may not
57:58 - need let me see what this one is okay we
58:07 - do need that device so we're good on
58:09 - those - these two are necessary within
58:12 - this we're probably gonna need some sort
58:22 - of enclosing just yeah we needed we need
58:30 - a div here to close this column I don't
58:34 - know how I messed this up so badly yeah
58:41 - this has to be close it should have paid
58:46 - more attention when I was copying
58:47 - pasting originally all right so that's
58:50 - there this is the outline
59:04 - Oh actually I don't need it there I need
59:06 - it there should be here there we go okay
59:12 - so that didn't need to go there and then
59:15 - this whole thing ought to be wrapped in
59:19 - closing div all right
59:30 - so we need so it's the class name div no
59:36 - I don't need I don't need this but I
59:42 - need one down here this kind of thing
59:54 - takes the most brainpower it seems like
59:57 - for me than anything just figuring out
60:02 - where I messed up this is this same
60:05 - problem happened to me a few hours ago
60:07 - do you think I would have learned my
60:09 - lesson at least it was easy for me to
60:16 - figure out the problem now since this
60:18 - happened before okay I think all the
60:20 - divs are in their proper places now yes
60:24 - all right awesome
60:28 - hmm all right so that one didn't have
60:33 - why is this doing this so this is not
60:40 - working the way we wanted to I'm gonna
60:44 - refresh okay we'll see so the Maya dev
60:48 - server did quit working so I'm not gonna
60:54 - now don't worry until I get it back up
60:56 - and running I actually did take time
60:59 - this morning and try to figure out why
61:01 - my dev server keeps stopping and I
61:06 - couldn't figure it out I thought like
61:08 - well maybe I should update node on my
61:12 - machine which I did I updated it which
61:14 - is probably I probably needed to update
61:16 - it anyway but the update did not fix it
61:19 - so I tried looking up the error on line
61:23 - and I found some other people that had
61:25 - the same error and the solutions it it
61:30 - didn't work so there were three issues
61:32 - on github about that error but for other
61:35 - nothing with next j/s so it's probably
61:39 - not an XJS problem two of the
61:43 - issues never got resolved and then the
61:48 - third issue the the resolution was just
61:52 - I tried a few things in it but a lot of
61:56 - it like just wasn't really applicable to
61:58 - my situation so anyway the end result
62:03 - was that the time I spent on it I only
62:07 - succeeded in upgrading node but I did
62:09 - not succeed in solving the problem so
62:13 - let me check out I'm gonna inspect this
62:15 - and my dev tools is on one of my other
62:18 - screens right now which I'll bring it
62:20 - over if I need to okay so it seems like
62:28 - wrapping that div around everything is
62:35 - not it's not gonna work which that
62:44 - stinks because I said judge took a lot
62:47 - of effort to make sure all my dad's
62:49 - messed up okay
63:00 - all right so here's what I'm gonna try
63:02 - this son let's take out these divs now
63:05 - I'm gonna try to be very careful when I
63:09 - take these out so I don't mess things up
63:11 - again so there's one and there's the
63:13 - matching one okay and I just need to do
63:16 - that one more time so this is a div so
63:19 - there's one and there's the matching one
63:24 - okay great so I'm gonna I'm just going
63:28 - to confirm that I'm getting the same
63:29 - error yep same air okay so we're back
63:33 - kind of where we started and here's my
63:39 - idea for a solution right now so I think
63:45 - what I'll do is I'm gonna try to add in
63:52 - I'd say I want to try this is I just
63:54 - want to see if it's possible I don't
63:56 - feel like looking it up I'd rather just
63:58 - just do it here's what I want to try I
64:05 - want to I want to do
64:14 - I want to try to put a ternary inside
64:21 - that's her name
64:23 - there's no way there's no way this will
64:25 - work but I think it's cool to try all
64:31 - right so I am gonna need a closing div
64:33 - here and now I'm also gonna need another
64:38 - closing div here and let's see display
64:52 - content so this even so within this all
64:57 - right so this is our alternate and then
65:00 - we go down here and
65:08 - which they're closing trying to find out
65:13 - where our other ternary actually closed
65:17 - I guess it's not there it was there but
65:28 - I don't think that's doing anything okay
65:34 - all right let's see what errors we get
65:40 - all right that's not what I was
65:42 - expecting
65:44 - let me see what I did
65:46 - oh I have a div I don't need any more
65:49 - right
65:56 - if I want to be really excited this
65:59 - actually works it works all right I'm
66:04 - pretty sure we're gonna add in like one
66:07 - more thing just to double-check but we
66:09 - didn't get an error like all right so
66:11 - check this up it is in fact possible to
66:14 - nest turn Aries and it works it looks a
66:20 - bit messy it's like a lot of mental
66:23 - effort to keep it all straight for me
66:25 - and it's probably giving a mess if I
66:27 - ever want to come back in here and
66:28 - change it so I don't know that I would
66:30 - ever recommend it or do it again but it
66:33 - definitely works that's really cool I
66:37 - though that was fun I don't know if you
66:40 - all what you all think about it but it's
66:42 - sometimes it's fun to just do things
66:44 - even if you're not sure if it'll work
66:49 - all right I'm gonna check the live chat
66:52 - really quick because I'm sure that that
66:58 - some of you had something to say about
66:59 - what I was doing
67:01 - did my a actually that was great timing
67:06 - all right so I'll do my five minutes now
67:10 - or the live chat
67:27 - let's see okay so John said I have asked
67:30 - before if I was missing something about
67:32 - why we should have a click Handler and
67:34 - John said it's because what if a person
67:36 - skips one or two or three headings will
67:39 - not add an even order in those headings
67:41 - along with the open and close elements
67:43 - oh I see what you're saying now
67:49 - all right so sorry I didn't get that
67:51 - until now so basically the idea was so
67:55 - yeah if everything's open in order let
67:58 - me use this one for an example so if
68:00 - everything does get open you know in
68:02 - order you get the audio in effect right
68:05 - it's nice but what if somebody just
68:06 - skips right so you have to line up here
68:13 - so I hadn't thought about that I think I
68:17 - actually don't think the effect is is
68:20 - bad when there's this gap and there's
68:23 - obvious that there's another one in
68:24 - there because I'm thinking basically
68:29 - what would end up happening I think
68:30 - would be more jarring than this so that
68:37 - if I had these open like this and then I
68:40 - opened this one I guess it honest on a
68:45 - shorter screen it didn't really make a
68:46 - difference but if you could see them
68:48 - both what you would see happening is
68:51 - this one would open up here and then
68:52 - this one would flop it what this would
68:54 - flip flip flop right here so I think I'm
69:01 - okay with this happening
69:09 - but that's definitely a good thought I
69:11 - didn't even occur to me at all yeah so I
69:19 - think I am going to leave it like this
69:20 - but I appreciate I appreciate the
69:22 - thought and you're explaining it to me
69:24 - since I didn't understand right away
69:31 - no man I never noticed this picture is a
69:34 - little bit old so this isn't there we
69:37 - get a new food service vendor for the
69:40 - for the University and I don't think
69:42 - that this is the name of this coffee
69:45 - place anymore so I'm surprised nobody
69:49 - noticed because my boss is usually like
69:51 - he notices every little detail like that
69:56 - she must not actually looked at this
69:58 - picture cuz I bet he would have noticed
69:59 - it I don't think it's the big deal but I
70:05 - think we usually like to not make
70:08 - anything in the image that could give a
70:10 - date so that people don't realize like
70:12 - hey we're using like really old images
70:14 - or something in our sights anyway let me
70:18 - put in one more I'm gonna put in the
70:22 - data for let's see yeah I want to put in
70:32 - the data for one more so that I can
70:33 - actually see if we're getting the
70:35 - correct ordering happening because right
70:43 - now I really I can't tell
70:48 - so think the only one is crucification
70:54 - kind of context
70:55 - FastTrack okay so this is the only one
70:57 - that I haven't put in yet so I'm
71:01 - entering this into WordPress oops
71:06 - and I should probably while I'm doing it
71:13 - I should probably just put in this link
71:15 - like it's supposed to be
71:34 - okay sorry about this this is boring
71:38 - stuff but I definitely think you need to
71:42 - test this before I move on so I was I
71:47 - was pretty sure it wasn't gonna work and
71:48 - so since it did work I'm very I'm still
71:51 - a little skeptical since its appearing
71:54 - to where I Creighton huh
72:05 - it's made this image the other nice
72:13 - thing is that when I get all these
72:15 - images into WordPress I can take them
72:20 - out of the the react app so they don't
72:25 - need to be stored on the same server
72:27 - right now they're not in gonna be
72:30 - tracked and get anymore so it'll make
72:33 - everything just a little bit smaller
72:45 - oh man that's huge image I need to go in
72:48 - and
73:12 - sorry I just lost my train of thought
73:14 - right in the middle oh I need to go in
73:16 - and get better image sizes for this this
73:21 - was on my list of things to do and then
73:25 - I got pushed pushed into doing some
73:29 - other things and never got back to doing
73:32 - the images okay
73:37 - so let's refresh and we should have
73:41 - everything nope
73:48 - all right so I'm really glad I did that
73:50 - because we are not getting the
73:54 - alternating like we want did I actually
73:57 - change the order of these yeah I did
74:02 - okay so this definitely has us a
74:04 - different order all right so what's
74:11 - going on
74:37 - alright I'm gonna check the chat really
74:39 - quick to see if anyone has any ideas if
74:46 - I'm missing something
74:47 - oh yeah Sebastian did say about the dev
74:53 - server it is definitely just this
74:55 - machine because I can use it on my my
74:58 - laptop and the repo works fine and the
75:02 - dev server is fine so I don't know what
75:04 - is going on with my machine
75:25 - okay Patrick addict the idea to refactor
75:29 - those these chunks so I'm assuming you
75:32 - meet within this within this componentry
75:35 - fact there are a lot of this stuff that
75:37 - I'm repeating into stateless components
75:41 - and then that way it'll be a lot easier
75:45 - to read yeah you're right when I first
75:47 - was doing this I didn't think it would
75:51 - get this this huge but maybe I should
75:54 - just make those into components now and
75:57 - yeah that will be so much easier Todd
76:07 - John says Jesse you live on the edge you
76:09 - only learn by being fearless I like that
76:13 - thanks Jeff yeah I mean what like what's
76:18 - the worst that could happen I just get
76:19 - an error message right and then I just
76:22 - you know hit hit ctrl Z or command Z and
76:26 - then it's all good it's back to normal
76:28 - again and I'm using you know get as well
76:31 - so I could just go back to previous
76:33 - commit so why not like it's not like I
76:38 - can it's a local deficit might as well
76:41 - try out whatever I want
76:57 - John I saw you just said he said it
77:00 - could be jarring meaning like the
77:01 - back-and-forth that I was talking about
77:03 - with the order unless you he said unless
77:06 - you animate JK's yeah I always I always
77:14 - think it'd be cool to animate things and
77:16 - I would like to do it but I just like
77:18 - don't have time right now
77:21 - only because like you all know like I
77:24 - need to be done with this project by
77:26 - neck like by the middle of next week
77:28 - so there's definitely things that
77:34 - definitely things that I would like to
77:37 - do that I'm just not gonna be able to do
77:47 - Sode is asked a few questions hey
77:52 - welcome to the channel I don't think
77:54 - I've seen you in here before so welcome
77:57 - this is we're using JavaScript and it's
78:02 - in particular to react the react
78:04 - framework in JavaScript and sawdust can
78:11 - you teach me and want to be an expert in
78:12 - programming languages please can you
78:15 - teach me well if you watch this you'll
78:18 - get some idea of what my job is like so
78:22 - it's not exactly like a teaching like
78:24 - tutorial based thing I am gonna release
78:27 - some videos on my own channel hopefully
78:30 - sometime soon if I can quit having these
78:34 - crazy deadlines and those will be more
78:37 - tutorial oriented if you have any
78:39 - specific questions or want me to check
78:41 - out your code you can direct message me
78:42 - on Twitter and I'll try to check
78:46 - everything out when I get a chance
78:53 - yeah and Sudd said would you say PHP
79:02 - yeah so I did a little bit of PHP for
79:06 - this a custom plugin for WordPress so
79:08 - everything else has been JavaScript
79:22 - okay so Sebastian is giving me some
79:25 - alternate syntax that may be able to
79:30 - help me out here
79:40 - okay
79:50 - and see let me let me show you
80:04 - let me show you some of what is being
80:06 - pasted in the live chat so I said didn't
80:14 - didn't catch everything so something
80:20 - like this
80:44 - okay so let me so I'm getting some some
80:49 - good advice here in the chat so let me
80:50 - let me go back in here and let's try to
80:54 - do so basically I don't need to nest my
81:01 - statements or wait let me see what
81:07 - school
81:30 - all right so basically this is this
81:33 - syntax is is saying I just want to make
81:36 - sure I had it right before I told
81:37 - everybody's sorry for the pause saying
81:40 - if it even then do something else don't
81:45 - do anything so you're saying basically
82:00 - so I can basically get rid of like areas
82:04 - where I'm using like the question mark
82:08 - and the : I'm trying to find an example
82:17 - oh if I'm on the wrong page that's why
82:19 - sorry yeah so like normally I use the
82:24 - question mark and then the : here so I
82:29 - wouldn't need to use those then but I
82:38 - think in this case I I do need the else
82:42 - right so for like for this if it's even
82:51 - I need to render this if it's not even
82:57 - so I need that else I neither under this
83:00 - correct
83:11 - now for these ones I could try that out
83:18 - for these ones right because I'm
83:21 - rendering nothing here so I could get
83:27 - rid of
83:37 - so and so this
83:51 - so like for this one I could do this
83:55 - props URL oh actually I don't know if I
84:03 - could do it because I'm not checking for
84:05 - true or false here I'm checking to see
84:07 - if it's if it's blank so this was
84:11 - probably only work if what I'm checking
84:12 - for would be true or false if I'm
84:15 - checking for anything else then I
84:16 - couldn't miss I might not be able to do
84:19 - it or could I still do it but I would
84:24 - just have to put the end right here
84:52 - all right so let me let me share this
85:07 - and then I could do this
85:16 - alright cool let me just see because
85:19 - this should I'm pretty sure that that
85:23 - part of the template is the one the only
85:24 - one is rendering right now cool really
85:32 - cool I don't know what this this should
85:38 - actually have a link in it I want to
85:43 - double check to make sure that the link
85:46 - is there
85:57 - I guess I never put put the link in so
86:01 - it should have one
86:22 - okay
86:25 - I'm gonna get rid of these as well
86:27 - inside here cuz I don't I don't want to
86:29 - see the doubles anymore
86:34 - that'll shorten this up a bit - okay
86:59 - okay
87:03 - let's make sure Ricky
87:20 - okay
87:34 - let me bring over it's a little awkward
87:36 - right now I had my terminal underneath
87:38 - this the window that I was the live chat
87:41 - was on so I'm gonna bring it over bring
87:45 - it over here so you all can see what I'm
87:47 - doing on the terminal as well
88:05 - okay son I see I see you gave me your
88:10 - email they're just uh do you have a
88:17 - github profile where you have your codes
88:20 - so you could give me the link to that
88:22 - then I could check that out also all the
88:26 - links to all my social media stuff are
88:28 - linked up somewhere in the description
88:30 - this video some are links from my
88:31 - youtube account so you can you could
88:37 - contact me in a variety of ways but if
88:41 - you want to send me a link to your
88:42 - github then then I can check that out
88:56 - okay cabbie and says the the empty
89:01 - string is false II so I don't even have
89:03 - to have that so where was I at here so I
89:15 - should be able to just do this right
89:51 - yeah I just thought the same thing
89:53 - Patrick so Patrick put in the live chat
89:55 - you titled this refactoring you're
89:57 - getting a lot of refactoring advice yeah
90:00 - I accept itíll this refactoring because
90:01 - I wasn't sure what else to call it but I
90:03 - was only billing some refactoring but I
90:06 - thought I don't think I've ever titled a
90:09 - video refactoring so let's let's do that
90:12 - and now it's it it's actually nearly
90:15 - entirely refactoring at this point so it
90:18 - was appropriate Oh Patrick just had a
90:27 - good idea saying that I should try
90:31 - cloning into a new directory on my
90:33 - machine to see if that will fix the
90:35 - server issue I'll have to try that I I
90:39 - had not tried that yet so I'll try that
90:44 - out if that works that will be awesome
90:56 - all right let me let me see all right so
91:06 - did I say that let's see make sure that
91:08 - really works
91:10 - okay cool whoa
91:15 - did you all see this somehow I'm getting
91:20 - the images now right how is this rule
91:24 - where are these coming from they are in
91:30 - fact coming from WordPress so I don't
91:34 - know what I did I didn't do anything but
91:36 - now all of a sudden the images are
91:38 - working and you've seen that like they'd
91:41 - never work locally they'd always oh well
91:44 - I'm not complaining all right so
91:51 - basically what we need to do then is
91:55 - figure out why it's not flipping the
92:00 - order like we wanted to and rendering
92:04 - this other thing maybe my nested ternary
92:12 - operator just does not work and that's
92:16 - certainly possible we could also let's
92:24 - see
92:40 - I said only to let me um I'm gonna check
92:46 - on dev tools and I'll bring this over to
92:49 - the other screen now since it may be
92:53 - beneficial for everyone to see this so
92:56 - I'm gonna check on dev tools and see
92:58 - what exactly the props are that are
93:00 - being passed here to make sure we're
93:02 - getting the right index okay so this one
93:07 - has an index of one so we should be
93:11 - getting okay this was index zero all
93:16 - right so it looks like the index yeah
93:18 - that's that's what we want so we should
93:20 - be getting like true and false
93:24 - alternating but we're not all right so
93:34 - let's put in
94:30 - oops
94:36 - this oh no I forgot this I even made
94:42 - sure that I use the arrow function so
94:45 - that this would work okay cool so now
94:51 - we're getting what we need so we have
94:57 - false true false true false
95:14 - who
95:18 - so we're getting a value
95:28 - so then the problem is we can at least
95:32 - move down here and see maybe it's within
95:37 - our return area
95:53 - just can't show those persons
96:01 - okay our bad I see since you've been
96:05 - using this props URL a number of times
96:08 - [Music]
96:09 - so I can D structure that to Const URL
96:14 - this props
96:15 - yeah I probably could do some D
96:18 - structuring I'm gonna I'm not gonna do
96:22 - it right now because if I turn these
96:26 - into I want to see like how much I can
96:29 - reduce the usage of it by turning these
96:31 - into their own components
97:24 - okay so let me see
97:33 - I was just reading I'm reading all the
97:36 - the advice here and the live chat I
97:39 - probably should have read it out loud
97:41 - sorry to everyone who had to sat through
97:44 - that silence I think someone mentioned I
97:50 - should be calling it like that
97:53 - oh that was it all right let me let me
98:01 - figure out who said that so I can thank
98:04 - you properly I can't believe I miss that
98:11 - heavy in art so Kevin thank you so much
98:16 - so here's the problem I was using this
98:22 - even this is even instead of actually
98:27 - calling it like that and that was it
98:29 - that was the problem it's crazy because
98:33 - I even did it the right way up here so
98:36 - really good catch with that one awesome
98:40 - so now our even odd thing is working and
98:45 - I need to switch the order of this but
98:48 - I'm not gonna do it on the stream
98:50 - because I'm actually gonna do it in
98:54 - WordPress I'm just gonna change the date
98:55 - the published date of this to make it
98:59 - publish after and then everything will
99:01 - be in the right order all right awesome
99:04 - so this is the this needs to be
99:08 - populated with a huge list but I'm not
99:12 - worried about that now I might I might
99:14 - not even do it myself I might have the
99:17 - Amy who's doing the content management
99:23 - put all that that data in I should
99:26 - probably have her do some of this anyway
99:27 - and then that way it'll be like training
99:30 - for whenever I'm not working on this
99:32 - anymore all right awesome
99:35 - so the courses page works now we should
99:43 - probably clean this mess up
99:46 - alright so I'm gonna let me get rid of
99:52 - this I don't need this
99:53 - but I'm gonna commit this because it
99:56 - works and then we'll refactor and if I
100:00 - make a big mess of everything at least I
100:02 - will have a working version that's been
100:05 - committed that I can always go back to
100:12 - whoa okay I gotta get rid of I
100:18 - originally had different components for
100:20 - each one of those before I changed my
100:22 - mind and did it in just all one
100:25 - component so
100:37 - there we go
101:02 - also this is no I was gonna say it'll
101:07 - make everything look nicer and it'll be
101:09 - easier to work with where do we add
101:10 - please fix them okay I forgot to remove
101:18 - that that's an easy fix
101:23 - so I was directly using out link and
101:27 - since I moved it into this component I
101:30 - don't need it anymore so that was the
101:34 - the air there so let's do that again
101:41 - great all right looks like I have an
101:45 - update for NPM available
101:55 - all right cool so while that does this
101:58 - thing
102:05 - let's work on this oops
102:11 - okay so first of all first of all oh I'm
102:16 - gonna try to figure out what should be
102:18 - put into its own stateless functional
102:23 - component and so basically things that
102:31 - I'm I'm repeating are really good
102:33 - candidates or potentially things that I
102:40 - might not be repeating now but I could
102:41 - see you needing to repeat elsewhere
102:44 - somewhere else on the site are also good
102:45 - candidates for this
102:58 - all right so let's see
103:25 - I guess this could be
103:32 - this probably could be I'm kind of
103:35 - hesitant because I don't really want to
103:38 - do the work of doing the click and then
103:42 - sending the data back and all that so
103:48 - let's we'll see oh I mean I'll do it if
103:50 - it really seems like I obviously should
103:52 - do it let me see how many times I use
103:56 - that twice
104:16 - actually that is a really good candidate
104:19 - I think because I potentially this could
104:21 - be used in other parts of the site too
104:26 - all right let's do it
104:31 - the reason I didn't want to do it is
104:33 - because I have done it before where I I
104:36 - have a clique that changes state and
104:39 - apparent component but I've only done it
104:42 - like twice and so I'm not real sure
104:45 - about it so since I've already messed up
104:48 - so much on today's stream I'm not in a
104:50 - hurry to do it again but oh whoa I guess
104:53 - there's only it's the only one way to
104:59 - really learn something and remember it
105:02 - and that's to keep doing it in practice
105:04 - so let's do it I definitely need to
105:06 - change the song I'm listening to it
105:08 - because it's really annoying
105:09 - all right
105:18 - let's see so we're gonna call this
105:22 - component
105:41 - I'm trying to get a name for this
105:42 - component try to name it like based on
105:45 - what it does since it's gonna have a
105:46 - click handler basically it's gonna show
105:52 - hi but it doesn't necessarily have to
105:54 - show hide the click could do other
105:56 - things it really it makes sense with the
106:00 - way we're handling this SVG that it is a
106:03 - show hide but it doesn't necessarily
106:06 - have to be
106:20 - so I guess I'll just call it click
106:24 - heading alright cuz it's it's an h3 tag
106:27 - it's a heading and you click it yeah cuz
106:33 - a lot of stuff I could potentially make
106:37 - a lot of the stuff in here changeable
106:39 - based on the props so it could be pretty
106:44 - versatile alright so let's do that let's
106:45 - call it click heading Oh what happened
106:51 - oh I shoulda used to - wait what's that
106:56 - I remember someone gave me the advice of
107:01 - how to use the command to use if you've
107:05 - accidentally run something that you
107:07 - should have run in sudo and there's a
107:08 - way to run it in sudo without having to
107:12 - type everything out again it was like s
107:15 - Oh with with two exclamation points
107:19 - awesome
107:27 - what's wrong one use my password for my
107:32 - labs up and not for this machine
107:34 - alright cool thank you so much for
107:38 - giving me that command so quickly it's
107:42 - been a really long time since I had to
107:44 - use it so I didn't remember wait a
107:48 - second
107:49 - alright cool it worked that was really
107:52 - fast I thought it was an error for a
107:55 - second because it was so fast but let's
108:01 - touch components and Woody's is gonna be
108:06 - click heading
108:19 - all right
108:22 - so now we have this component and I had
108:26 - I hid this earlier just to give some
108:32 - more give us some more space I'll
108:35 - probably decide it again if you use atom
108:39 - this is actually really cool light I
108:41 - used atom for years before I even
108:42 - realize this shortcut command so like
108:46 - you know the slash that shares a key
108:50 - with the question mark I can't ever
108:52 - remember which ones forward session
108:53 - which was back slash that one
108:55 - automatically comments something for you
108:57 - but if you use the other slash the one
109:00 - that's just below the backspace or
109:02 - delete key depending on what it says on
109:04 - your keyboard that one shows in hi it's
109:06 - this little thing in the corner super
109:09 - useful alright so so we're gonna do
109:17 - let's take let's see if I have a
109:23 - stateless functional component to just
109:25 - steal from and I don't oh sorry
109:30 - yawning I didn't have my normal energy
109:35 - drink today before the stream so I'm a
109:40 - little tired yawning said I had no no G
109:43 - fuel to the hey alright so I'm I want to
109:49 - try to type this component out without
109:52 - copying because it might actually be
109:55 - faster than trying to find one and I
109:59 - think I can do it
109:59 - so I import react
110:09 - we can import reactant reacts and we're
110:13 - gonna do Const and
110:14 - what do we call this click heading
110:25 - equals alright now I'm stuck now I need
110:30 - to look all right let's see which one
110:39 - did we do this with there use it with
110:48 - this now we didn't
110:59 - I don't know that we have any in here
111:02 - because this one was one but then we
111:04 - added I think we added State to it okay
111:11 - I'll have to check my other my other
111:17 - project I know I use them in my side
111:22 - project that I'm doing for my course
111:23 - right now so I will check that okay
111:29 - Sebastian Sebastian has my back there we
111:34 - go
111:35 - props I couldn't remember what went in
111:37 - there just FYI I've only probably built
111:42 - maybe three stateless functional
111:45 - components so far in my entire life so
111:48 - that's why I can't remember the syntax
111:51 - ok this probes and then just put the
112:01 - brackets I can't remember I don't think
112:05 - I need the brackets right
112:22 - no I just need parentheses right okay
112:43 - all right so that's all I need for the
112:48 - beginning and then I need to export it
112:59 - and I don't need this what I need my
113:01 - that's what I want
113:12 - Oh
113:15 - click heading
113:18 - why did i camelcase that when I needed
113:21 - to capitalize this I'm gonna have to
113:27 - rename it I don't know what I was
113:29 - thinking
113:37 - okay all right so that should work
113:50 - I'm going to need to copy over sorry
113:55 - h3
114:03 - all right
114:07 - so how h3 let's figure out what props we
114:12 - need to pass in so we need to make a
114:18 - click function here to handle the click
114:21 - and change the state in our parent
114:24 - component
114:57 - and so in here
115:04 - I'll put this so this is going to be
115:07 - doing the same thing now on click what
115:16 - we want to do is
115:28 - and see
115:51 - what am i I think I'm doing something
115:54 - similar in another component so let me
115:57 - let me look on my other screen I have my
116:00 - other project open so that I can just
116:04 - check this before I start fumbling
116:06 - around okay
116:29 - all right so that should be good
116:34 - I know we're calling it clickhandler
116:36 - here but I want it to be do I want this
116:41 - no I don't want it to be because yeah I
116:44 - want this to be reusable for other
116:46 - things other than just showing content
116:48 - so I don't want to call it that so I
116:49 - guess we could just call it click click
116:54 - Handler and we'll just so we'll have the
116:58 - proper name the same thing
117:14 - all right yeah and okay cabbies I see I
117:17 - don't really even need this part right I
117:27 - can get rid of that because I'm not
117:29 - doing any anything other than just
117:34 - saying there's a clique I don't need to
117:35 - pass any data
117:46 - okay all right so over here let's pull
117:52 - in this component and click it
118:07 - all right so click heading there and
118:19 - click heading
118:24 - all right so we definitely want to pass
118:27 - as clickhandler
118:45 - so will this a penny this
119:05 - okay
119:21 - and what else will we need we need to
119:29 - pass the state down and then we need the
119:33 - title okay
119:42 - it's my content it's gonna be this
119:53 - states content and then title
120:15 - I'd off to be rendered this profs title
120:20 - rendered okay so now
120:29 - we can do
120:34 - trops display content and drops title
120:54 - all right
121:12 - let's check it out what did I mess up
121:34 - nineteen
121:42 - I mess this up up here
121:49 - copied over an extra one maybe that was
121:52 - it this drops click Handa is not a
121:56 - function
122:11 - where I do that
122:19 - Google Chrome thinks that my this error
122:22 - message is is Catalan so it's s wants me
122:26 - to translate it I wonder what it would
122:28 - translate to interesting there we go
122:39 - whoa
122:50 - all right definitely messed something up
122:53 - let me see
123:14 - alright I'm gonna check
123:25 - and checking the live chat quickly
123:34 - alright let's say there's some
123:36 - discussion in the live chat about
123:40 - Lanie's commands
123:51 - okay Kevin so yes I removed the
123:55 - parentheses let's see okay I didn't
124:09 - remove them here
124:19 - okay I forgot - no wait I did but I did
124:25 - pull the side one did I do this right
124:27 - these props title render this props
124:32 - title twice the title not being rendered
124:41 - actually
125:13 - yes you'd Sarah's in the lab chat hey
125:15 - Sarah glad you could join us
125:28 - okay I'm gonna need to probably wrap
125:30 - this up and do a few more things before
125:36 - I have to go I have a meeting with a
125:39 - potential client later on for a side
125:42 - thing I'm not sure if I'm going to do
125:44 - the website is gonna be like a really
125:48 - basic WordPress website I'm just not
125:51 - sure that I'm really interested in doing
125:52 - it but the person that wants me to do
125:59 - the site is a friend from from high
126:02 - school and she was friends with my wife
126:05 - and so I felt bad because she hired
126:09 - somebody to do this WordPress site and
126:12 - she was gonna pay him $250 up front and
126:15 - then $250 when they were done and all
126:19 - they had to do the first step of all
126:22 - they had to do was just redirect a
126:24 - domain name which is no big deal and
126:27 - then just kind of like make the theme
126:31 - look a little bit better potentially
126:34 - probably just find a better theme and
126:36 - just apply that theme instead of the old
126:39 - theme so it was really basic stuff and I
126:41 - think it's been months I think it's been
126:44 - since December and she hasn't heard from
126:46 - this person and she already paid him
126:49 - half the money so I feel bad so I still
126:55 - kind of don't want to do the sightly I'm
126:56 - not excited about doing the work at all
126:58 - but I do feel bad and I don't really I
127:04 - don't know we'll see I'll see what she
127:07 - wants I'm at least gonna meet with her
127:08 - and see what she wants for the site and
127:10 - if it's something I can do really
127:13 - quickly I guess I'll do it and maybe
127:16 - I'll just say like whatever you're gonna
127:19 - pay the other guy just pay me the rest
127:22 - of it you know whatever's remaining
127:23 - which will probably 250 and then and
127:27 - I'll just finish up I did he did do some
127:30 - work but I found like a test WordPress
127:33 - site but it wasn't great looking
127:39 - all right so as a as I was going off on
127:45 - the little tangent there about my
127:46 - meeting I was trying to look through
127:48 - this and try to figure out why the title
127:50 - is not showing up actually let me look
127:53 - there's my dev tools that I want to see
127:59 - what the what's being passed down to
128:03 - these components spanning section click
128:12 - heading
128:29 - okay so it looks like it's not getting
128:34 - the say it's not even showing up that
128:41 - there's this title prop at all this
128:43 - props title rendered
128:53 - Oh
128:57 - because it's not title rendered right
128:59 - because we're inside of a component
129:01 - we're passing the data in as title right
129:04 - so let me see on our course page every
129:11 - way I can just see where I'm using title
129:12 - elsewhere right
129:26 - this props title yeah I don't have to
129:29 - put render that's the problem okay oh my
129:40 - this should should fix the problem
129:43 - yep there we go all right great so our
129:50 - clique still work and now we've taken
129:54 - some stuff out into a component awesome
130:00 - so now we can replace all of our h3s
130:09 - which i think is just to not not a huge
130:14 - improvement but still helps I mean that
130:21 - when it's all spread out like that
130:23 - that's you know that's a number of lines
130:24 - right there that's all right save that
130:28 - just check make sure it's working
130:31 - yep I mean
130:39 - dear refresh just to check for sure okay
130:43 - great
130:45 - actually you'll see this why is there a
130:49 - gap between this and this
131:00 - that's weird I don't like that
132:00 - that's weird
132:19 - okay see all these other sections are 35
132:23 - pixels tall and this one's 54 pixels
132:25 - tall why is that it's not leave its the
132:33 - site isn't being defined anywhere what
132:35 - is going on
132:43 - because this h3
132:53 - you see this tip here probably
133:11 - don't think I can see is there's it just
133:13 - as classic let's take that so that would
133:23 - be the second option here and it would
133:36 - be this div right
134:00 - well there's not there's no difference
134:04 - that I can see here in terms of in the
134:09 - code it looks the same but inin dev
134:11 - tools they have different heights
134:35 - oh I may have to wait and just figure
134:37 - that out at a different time because I
134:44 - gotta add a move on here alright so oops
134:52 - where am I
134:54 - kind of save I'm not sure what I edited
134:58 - but save it click heading
135:44 - all right so I got a switch to master
135:46 - and make one update before I go yeah I
135:51 - see sarah said CSS though yeah it's got
135:54 - to be something with the CSS oh off to
136:04 - look for that I don't want to do right
136:05 - now sometimes if CSS stuff is just
136:07 - pretty boring it's just a lot of like
136:10 - clicking on elements and seeing what
136:12 - comes up in dev tools so I don't think
136:15 - that'll be that fun to have on the
136:17 - stream and I got a yes it's um
136:21 - I have a meeting in less than 45 minutes
136:25 - so I need to get this done so I'll do
136:29 - one of the things I have to do I can do
136:32 - on stream and that'll be fine the other
136:33 - thing is just me getting data out of
136:36 - Salesforce like manually actually
136:39 - copying pasting data and doing math with
136:42 - in a Google sheet so that's not gonna be
136:46 - fun to show and has nothing to do with
136:47 - coding it's just a test that I wish I
136:51 - could automate I can't get right now so
136:59 - now let's go to the all right whether I
137:03 - page you will be the courses page let me
137:06 - refresh
137:14 - yeah
137:39 - okay so definitely I'm gonna make this a
137:48 - link and I probably should make I'm not
137:58 - sure that people will realize that this
137:59 - is a link but I'm going to just make
138:01 - that like they in the last meeting I had
138:05 - that they wanted this to be a link but I
138:07 - think I ought to put something maybe
138:14 - right under here
138:15 - have a button like this kind of button
138:18 - but under here
138:25 - I'm just not sure what to call it we we
138:28 - threw out some ideas at the meaning on
138:29 - what to call it and it never came to a
138:31 - decision on what we should call the
138:32 - button and I don't really have time to
138:36 - talk to everybody and get them I'm not
138:38 - even sure if anybody's still here I mean
138:40 - it's after 4:00 on a Friday I'm sure a
138:42 - lot of people are gone
138:54 - I'd hate to call the button just say go
138:56 - but I don't want it to be too long like
139:03 - I could say if there's a Franciscan oh I
139:08 - don't know if you'll have any ideas yeah
139:12 - I know I uh yeah I don't know who's
139:16 - gonna expect to click that's what I said
139:18 - I didn't think anybody was gonna expect
139:19 - to click on the title because we don't
139:20 - really have clickable titles anywhere
139:24 - else on this page and pretty much
139:25 - nowhere except for the the blog the news
139:28 - page do we have clickable titles so but
139:33 - anyway they wanted to be clickable so
139:35 - I'll just make it clickable but I do
139:38 - need to put a button of this style up
139:43 - here I think they they kind of wanted
139:48 - like two buttons side by side they still
139:50 - want this link to the PDF of more
139:53 - information see the originally this was
139:57 - supposed to be the link to go to
140:00 - Franciscan at home calm and I only threw
140:03 - the PDF in there as a placeholder but
140:08 - now they want to keep it and so it was
140:12 - gonna be really simple I was just gonna
140:14 - replace the link but now I actually have
140:17 - to do something else all right well I
140:18 - may as well just throw some things in
140:20 - here see what they look like so what's
140:23 - this course is
140:37 - all right so now we're back to the the
140:41 - old version of the courses phase all
140:45 - right so here's what we have
140:55 - here's our button so let's put it here
141:06 - let's see what it looks like
141:11 - oops I put in the wrong spot
141:20 - here we go this is where it needs to go
141:31 - oh well not I don't really like that too
141:35 - that much
142:14 - all right let me see I'm gonna take the
142:16 - live chat since I was see if anyone has
142:19 - any ideas
142:35 - Kevin in response to the Google I
142:41 - mentioned I was doing some stuff in
142:42 - Google sheets the Google sheet
142:44 - automation is not a problem because
142:47 - that's done in just JavaScript so it's
142:49 - not really a big deal the problem is on
142:51 - the Salesforce side of things is getting
142:54 - the data out of Salesforce and into the
142:58 - Google sheet the data that I need
143:00 - because it's not just Salesforce it's
143:03 - some like old plugin that I'm not really
143:06 - thrilled with for Salesforce so I can't
143:08 - even use like the normal documentation
143:10 - for doing things in Salesforce also the
143:13 - account that I've been given doesn't
143:15 - really let me do that much so even if I
143:18 - knew how to do it I probably don't even
143:21 - have access to send that data to the
143:24 - Google sheet and then I'm also getting
143:27 - data I am getting data from another
143:30 - Google sheet so I'd have to pull in data
143:32 - from two different places in the sheet
143:34 - which is not a big deal in terms of the
143:36 - Google sheet but anyway so for
143:40 - Salesforce that's that's the problem
143:42 - like it it probably I mean in the long
143:47 - run it would probably be good to learn
143:48 - how to do that but I'm just I haven't
143:51 - had a great experience with that
143:52 - particular like plugin that we're using
143:56 - I'm not really impressed with it and the
143:59 - documentation for it is is terrible like
144:01 - and actually non-existent for a lot of
144:04 - things so it's just really hard to
144:06 - figure out how to do anything I don't
144:09 - know if anybody else has ever worked in
144:11 - like higher education before but the
144:16 - people who provide like software and web
144:20 - services for our education like the
144:23 - products are not good but I always try
144:27 - to say positive things as I say it
144:29 - nicely as I can but they're not good I'm
144:32 - really really really disappointed and
144:35 - everything even like the service like
144:39 - asking them for things or like can we do
144:41 - this or could you do it's just really
144:44 - really bad and
144:47 - even to the point where like when I've
144:49 - actually gone in and changed code to
144:50 - make it better and told them like hey
144:53 - you know feel free to give this to your
144:55 - other clients because I'm sure they need
144:57 - to do the same thing too and we're not
145:00 - talking like big deal stuff just simple
145:02 - stuff like making making things
145:05 - responsive so that they work on a phone
145:08 - things that people expect to get and the
145:10 - response was like no we're not gonna
145:12 - give it to anybody like well are you
145:15 - serious that's gave you this free free
145:18 - code but and that the excuse basically
145:22 - the whole reason was they're trying to
145:23 - get people to pay more money for a
145:24 - different product that was going to be
145:26 - responsive and so they didn't want to
145:29 - update their old product anymore even
145:32 - though everybody was still in their old
145:34 - product they had only sold their new
145:36 - product to one school anyway sorry for
145:39 - the rant it was just really frustrating
145:41 - so if anybody wants an idea for an
145:44 - industry where you could probably break
145:46 - into and do a great job it would be in
145:49 - services for higher education because if
145:52 - you do a halfway decent job you will be
145:54 - better than most of the services that
145:56 - are out there right now
146:03 - all right really the only thing that's
146:05 - stopping me right now is from finishing
146:08 - this is just figuring out what to call
146:09 - this this button and normally I wouldn't
146:14 - care so much but I know if I call us
146:16 - something that the people in charge of
146:18 - this project don't like I'm gonna get
146:20 - called either in like an hour
146:23 - when I'm at a meeting or tomorrow
146:25 - morning or something they're gonna call
146:27 - me and say can you change the name of
146:29 - this button
146:48 - I really want to say begin I think this
146:51 - came up with like basically the idea of
146:55 - saying something like begin is they
147:01 - didn't like that because they didn't
147:02 - want people to think that they're like
147:03 - immediately starting a course I think
147:06 - people are like smart enough to know
147:08 - that they're not gonna immediately start
147:09 - the course especially if we're gonna
147:18 - keep this as learn more
147:26 - I need to get rid of this this border at
147:31 - the top maybe I have that margin top
147:34 - yeah I need to get rid of that don't
147:37 - need that margin there we go that looks
147:43 - better
147:47 - all right let me change this
147:57 - there we go I just want to make sure
148:00 - okay yeah it is it is in fact up so this
148:06 - is the site that it's being linked to
148:07 - the learning management site
148:10 - [Music]
148:18 - that's better than air
148:29 - okay and let's make this title a link so
148:35 - I'll grab this and
148:48 - oh I did it again I went to the wrong
148:50 - title keeps rolling up too much is this
148:52 - one that I want now probably I need to
149:02 - work with this color
149:05 - it might automatically change the color
149:09 - yeah dead so let me make this like text
149:17 - all right cool
149:19 - all right so now this can be clicked or
149:22 - this can be clicked and I mean their
149:27 - links they should work but I'm just
149:28 - gonna click alright cool
149:36 - and I wish they would have used the same
149:38 - color favicon up here I'm not sure where
149:42 - they even got that one I guess they made
149:44 - it by they I mean like the company that
149:49 - built this oh well I kind of wish that
149:53 - they'd consulted me more about the
149:57 - design so that it could have been
149:59 - consistent so like they're little things
150:01 - like a lot of like border-radius shadows
150:04 - things like this like this is not the
150:07 - behavior that happens on all of our
150:11 - other sites when we have an interaction
150:14 - with a button so yeah these are all I
150:19 - don't know I mean it's not like the
150:23 - information wasn't available about how
150:25 - to do this there's lots of sites lots of
150:29 - our sites that already use this and we
150:33 - have a style guide so oh well I just
150:41 - have this fear that at some point I'm
150:43 - going to be asked to redesign all this
150:47 - to match the University style and I've
150:49 - been assured by my bosses that that's
150:50 - not gonna happen but at one point I was
150:53 - not supposed to be working on this site
150:55 - either and that happens so I'm still
151:00 - like not convinced that it's not gonna
151:03 - happen and if it is gonna happen I'd
151:04 - rather just know it now then have a
151:07 - situation like this where I get pulled
151:08 - in at the last minute and and do this I
151:12 - would have liked to have had more time
151:14 - oh well that works let's commit that
151:42 - okay let's go to our servers
151:56 - so that'll do its thing an update and
152:00 - then we'll update the other server all
152:04 - right and while that's working i'll
152:06 - check the live chat and i need to keep
152:09 - an eye on the time to make sure i can
152:12 - update the data as well before I go so I
152:15 - may not be able to get to everything in
152:16 - the live chat so I apologize in advance
152:18 - for that but I scrolled up about halfway
152:21 - in the chat I don't think I missed
152:23 - anything from the beginning
152:30 - okay I'm gonna skip it it looks like
152:32 - there's some discussion about them and
152:35 - different things and some different
152:37 - Linux commands stuff so I'm gonna skip
152:38 - over a lot of that just for time and try
152:42 - to get to everyone's questions even
152:46 - though I'm sure there's some good
152:47 - information within those conversations
152:50 - I'll try to read them a different time
152:54 - if I can okay so Sebastian says stop
153:04 - your dev server go into the project
153:06 - folder and delete the the dot next
153:08 - folder check if your dev server works
153:09 - okay
153:10 - if it doesn't then clone the repo in a
153:13 - new folder all right awesome I'm gonna
153:15 - try that not right now but I'm
153:16 - definitely gonna try that so thank you
153:19 - John Hanson asks what happens when that
153:22 - course page gets really long with some
153:24 - kind of pagination or something some
153:27 - other system need to be built into the
153:28 - code it's possible right now it's the
153:33 - course section is not supposed to get
153:35 - longer so this is gonna stay pretty
153:41 - fixed for now and this will pretty much
153:43 - be be fixed but if that happens then I
153:49 - guess I'll have to build something in at
153:51 - that point it could be something like
153:55 - that it could be potentially like
153:57 - decreasing the font size and doing two
153:59 - columns although on a small screen that
154:01 - wouldn't it would still be large so I
154:03 - have to come up with something for that
154:05 - but I don't think it's supposed to grow
154:08 - any
154:09 - soon so so we'll see it actually it's
154:14 - taken a lot of time to build like each
154:16 - one of these because there's they have
154:18 - to do like video production and editing
154:21 - and everything for each one of these
154:22 - courses and so they'll be along you know
154:27 - a period of time of developing it before
154:29 - this would ever get added so I should I
154:31 - should have time to to do that if
154:33 - necessary
154:59 - okay Saad I thanks for giving me your
155:05 - github account so that's cool I'll check
155:09 - it out and then yeah let me know like
155:12 - any specific questions that you have
155:14 - about your code or anything you want me
155:15 - to look at in particular send me a
155:18 - message on on Twitter or I guess you
155:22 - could put it in the comments in the
155:23 - video I mean I'm more likely to see it
155:25 - directly if you put it on Twitter so
155:30 - that's probably the most reliable way to
155:34 - get in touch with me
155:43 - oh don't worry son don't worry about it
155:46 - you're not bothering me not at all
156:02 - yeah I just XANA you say you're out
156:07 - dressing your dog cuz it got colder so
156:12 - is that like legit your dog has a
156:14 - sweater on now or something is that
156:32 - Kevi and i just saw you're talking about
156:34 - the I just noticed the component is not
156:36 - stateless it needs state to know if it
156:38 - renders the SVG rotated or not or it may
156:41 - receive the orientation for the triangle
156:43 - in a prop yes so it does receive it and
156:47 - I'm sure you probably saw that
156:49 - afterwards but yeah we just passed the
156:51 - state from the parent component down to
156:53 - the child in a prop and then the child
156:56 - doesn't really need to to have its own
156:58 - state which I can't see right now but
157:08 - now that you're think you're saying that
157:10 - I wonder I'm probably not gonna change
157:12 - it now but I was just kind of wondering
157:14 - like would it have been better no it
157:18 - wouldn't have been but I was I was
157:19 - wondering if the that component for the
157:22 - headings should have had its own state
157:23 - but I don't think it because I needed to
157:25 - use that same that state to show and
157:28 - hide in the other parent component so
157:30 - it's better I think for that state to
157:32 - live there especially if I put the
157:35 - content sections into their own
157:37 - component then that needs to be able to
157:40 - pass that same state down to two
157:41 - different components so I think it's
157:43 - better to just keep it in the parent and
157:45 - passed it as props to the children
157:47 - components but I may be mistaken if
157:50 - there's some good reason why I shouldn't
157:52 - do it like that I would like to know
158:01 - and you're asked if anybody has worked
158:03 - with graph QL I haven't worked with
158:05 - graph QL yet
158:07 - I mean I've like mess around a little
158:09 - bit with it but not not any serious work
158:11 - with it but I'm really impressed with
158:13 - what I've seen so far and I'd like to
158:14 - use it more
158:33 - Oh kevie and I see you're saying that
158:37 - for a debug tip render the props inside
158:39 - a pre tag in the stateless component
158:42 - cool thanks for that tip Santa said
158:51 - never worked for your distant family or
158:53 - friends
158:53 - yeah I'd I know I like all the clients
158:58 - that I still have better recurring
159:01 - clients are all either family or friends
159:04 - and it's like you can't what am I gonna
159:07 - say tell them I'm not gonna do this
159:08 - anymore I mean I guess if I had somebody
159:11 - that I don't know I don't know I like
159:16 - keep thinking maybe I should just get
159:18 - like subcontract the work that's
159:21 - somebody but even then like it's not
159:24 - enough money for it to be worthwhile for
159:26 - anyone like I have a client right now
159:27 - that's a family friend and last month I
159:31 - didn't even send him an invoice because
159:33 - they only owed me like 12 dollars I
159:35 - thought it's not really worth my time to
159:37 - even create and send an invoice for $12
159:40 - so I'll have to see but I think this
159:43 - month they're gonna owe me less than $30
159:45 - and I'm like thirty dollars a little bit
159:50 - better but is it really worth my time to
159:52 - actually like take time on a Saturday or
159:54 - something and you know go into the
160:00 - invoicing software and send it I don't
160:03 - know it's but it's it's hard to quit B
160:12 - it's hard to to get rid of a client that
160:16 - is a friend or family member so I just
160:19 - never should have done it anyway I
160:20 - should have said No
160:31 - Leonard's ass how often do you stream
160:35 - this type of project is this ongoing in
160:37 - parts and actually it looks like
160:40 - everybody already answered that question
160:42 - all answered for the sake of people
160:44 - watching this maybe later on I do stream
160:48 - Monday through Friday
160:50 - usually at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time
160:53 - occasionally I have to change the time
160:55 - and occasionally I'm not able to stream
160:58 - on a day but I usually will put it on
161:00 - Twitter like earlier in the day to let
161:05 - let everyone know whether there's a time
161:07 - change or whether I can't do it
161:31 - okay I'm seeing all the stuff now that
161:33 - everyone said about the like the weird
161:36 - spacing between those two headings so
161:39 - thanks for that I'll take a look at that
161:41 - later on too and try some of those
161:45 - things
162:26 - okay I see Sarah that you had said maybe
162:30 - don't make it a button just a link so
162:34 - sorry I didn't see that earlier so at
162:36 - this point I'm just gonna keep it as a
162:38 - button because I'm running out of time
162:40 - but maybe at some point I'll see how it
162:42 - looks like just as not a button in just
162:45 - the length
162:56 - hey Jeremy so if you're watching
163:00 - yesterday you may remember that Jeremy
163:03 - had a job interview today and Jeremy
163:09 - just came in the live chat and said that
163:10 - he got the job so awesome
163:13 - congratulations super excited for you
163:17 - so yeah awesome if if you're able to
163:22 - come back to a stream in the future
163:24 - please let us know how the jobs going
163:28 - that's really cool
163:50 - yeah Patrick I just so you said about
163:53 - the button animation very 1999 and moves
163:57 - in a very incorrect way yeah I agree I'm
164:00 - not really a big fan of the button
164:01 - animation on I guess I closed it out but
164:06 - earlier I had the site yeah this button
164:09 - I'm not really sure about this button
164:11 - animation because it the way it graze it
164:15 - out usually when something's grayed out
164:17 - like that that means that it's not
164:20 - clickable like it's not it's disabled so
164:24 - it's a little bit odd and it you know
164:27 - moves sideways and down which it makes
164:30 - it look like you've already clicked it
164:32 - when you when it's down so it's just
164:35 - it's it's not the animation doesn't
164:40 - really make sense for the purpose of
164:41 - that element so it's a little odd and
164:44 - then on top of that it's just this is
164:46 - not then you know we have a certain way
164:48 - of doing animation on buttons that we
164:50 - use across the board on all our sites
164:52 - and this is not that way so I think it's
164:55 - better to keep it consistent
165:15 - okay then I just saw that about the the
165:18 - project yeah I'm not sure let me so I am
165:24 - I'm gonna meet with the fraud I'm gonna
165:28 - meet with the client here it's very soon
165:30 - and actually I'll see what they want and
165:36 - and then I'll see if it's worthwhile if
165:40 - it's if it seems like maybe I'll let you
165:43 - all know if maybe one of you are up for
165:49 - doing it and Zanna maybe all depending
165:53 - on how the meeting goes maybe I'll send
165:54 - you a message on Twitter and let you
165:58 - know if if it's even worthwhile but that
166:04 - would actually be cool it's I think it's
166:05 - gonna be a really easy project like I
166:07 - don't even think it's gonna involve much
166:08 - coding at all it's just gonna be like
166:10 - customizing a wordpress theme most
166:13 - likely and that's you know that's that's
166:17 - not really a big deal so anyway I have
166:20 - got to go now
166:21 - so I need to get this data updated in
166:24 - about five minutes and then go
166:26 - luckily my meeting is only a few minutes
166:28 - away by car so I should still be able to
166:34 - get there on time but Kevin hey how's it
166:39 - going Kevin's here from Trinidad so glad
166:42 - you could join us
166:42 - sorry I'm about to end the stream so
166:45 - sorry you came in right at the end but
166:47 - you'll be able to watch the recording in
166:49 - just a few minutes it'll be available on
166:52 - on this channel in the free code Kent
166:54 - Channel so anyway thanks everyone for
166:57 - all your help today
166:59 - and let's see oh this is Friday right so
167:02 - have a great weekend and I'll see
167:04 - everyone on Tuesday so no stream on
167:07 - Monday and not working on Monday Tuesday
167:10 - I'll see you if anybody has any other
167:12 - questions he's helped with anything
167:13 - Twitter is the most reliable way to get
167:15 - a hold of me so you can message me on
167:19 - there otherwise I'll see everyone on
167:23 - Tuesday and
167:25 - [Music]
167:27 - again thanks so much for watching and
167:29 - all your help have a great weekend

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody its Jesse and today I'm just trying to get more done a lot of the same thing is yesterday but I did notice as I was going back through a lot of these components that they could use with a little bit of refactoring so there are some some changes that we made the components later on that were beneficial that I never went back and made those same changes some of the components that were made earlier so I am I'm going to go through and I was just adding an image in here just putting in some some content to test out a new component I just made so share the component in a second and let me check the I'm gonna check the live chat here we go I lost my my window for the live chat so hey everyone hairy ass what is react react is like a JavaScript framework it lets you build web apps and you can build other things with it too but it's it would be hard to sum up on a video but just that the very short answer is it's a JavaScript framework and it lets you build websites web apps and actually you can even build mobile apps and desktop apps very versatile and actually I think I saw a talk at a conference that recorded talk on YouTube about using react to build VR things which is really cool I don't really know how to how to do that but I know people are doing it so hey everyone alright so I see alright so you got a bunch of people in the chat now and hey Thor how's it going I haven't seen you know uh I Fernando from Argentina hey thanks for thanks for watching from Argentina actually there's a conference coming up in Argentina that I'm going to submit a talk for so actually I filled out everything I needed to submit it and then I got to the end and it asked for a video explaining you know a few minutes just explaining more about the talk and I couldn't do the video at the time cuz I was no it was up late all my kids were sleeping I didn't want to wake them up by making a video so hopefully I'll get some time to make that video and I can apply it would be really cool I've never never been to Argentina before if someone in the live chat whose name is an solo so like Han Solo but without the age and their avatar is a fixture of Han Solo so that's pretty cool alright so I got some questions in the live chat I guess I'll just answer them now before we we get started with some of the code and I'll throw some code up on the screen just you can see what I've been working on this is the new component on this side and it's doing a lot of stuff I have I did push this up to github so if you want to check out the code in more depth it's on the dev branch on github but let me just check out few questions I've epic asked how I load data in page load and react tree Redux I actually haven't used redux for anything so I can't I can't be of much help to you I'm taking a course right now and I'm gonna learn more about redux so maybe in another month or two I'll be able to answer that question but right now I'm just not experienced with it so I know how to load data on page load without Redux and actually you can you see will be will be doing some of that probably during today's stream so I don't know if that'll be helpful to you but if so you stick around well Patrick says there's even a way to developed commandline interfaces with react that's really cool I didn't realize that ek Howard asks I'm attending a coding bootcamp and I have to choose between react and Rails which one well it kind of depends on what you want to do but I'm I'm partial to react since I'm using it on a project now and react seems to be growing and there's a lot of jobs for react I don't know the numbers officially on Rails job sources react jobs but it seems like the momentum right now is at least with react so if your goal is to try to be marketable then reacts a really good skill to pick up you can vote a lot of stuff with it I don't have any experience at all and working with rails so I can't really give you great advice since I only know about react but actually correct me if I'm wrong is rails is more would Rails be more backend isn't that Ruby right is it and react would not normally be a backend type of thing I don't know maybe I'm wrong like I said I don't know very much at all about Rails so so definitely don't take my word for it okay so it looks like okay I was right so rails is backend so there you get so that's probably the best criteria is would you rather learn frontend stuff or backend so I guess it would depend on your goals like do you want to be a backend programmer or a fullstack or do you want to stick with frontend so that's that's what I would say I would also say to you know if you're gonna do the react boot camp then your JavaScript skills will get a lot better and that can translate into a lot of different things not just react so I know my JavaScript skills have gotten way better since I started doing things with react whereas before I was doing a lot of things with jQuery which jQuery is nice especially when you're starting out but if you if you want to be able to easily switch between different JavaScript frameworks knowing basic JavaScript is the best thing so it has really helped me okay all right so I think I got all the all the initial questions here in the live chat so yesterday I tried out a new system here where I used a Pomodoro timer to remind me to check the live chat and then also remind me to stop talking and do some more code so I'm going to do that again today I'm gonna start it as soon as I kind of catch you all up on what I've been doing also I I did a stream earlier today on my own channel so I had a suggestion so XANA who's not in the live chat yeah I don't see you in the live chat so maybe she's not watching right now but she had this suggestion to do just streams where I didn't have to worry about doing commentary or anything but I would just show what's on my screen and what I'm working on I had never thought about doing that before so I thought it was worth a shot and so I did so earlier today for about an hour I just showed what was on my screen I did it on my own YouTube channel because I wasn't sure I mean when I was invited to do the channel on free code or the show on free code camp it was based on what I normally do which is a commentary question and answer and that kind of thing so I didn't want to just switch things up and start broadcasting on free code camp without you know kind of checking with them first so it was a little bit spurofthemoment so that's why I just put it on my own channel so if you're interested in want to check it out there is a recording of it I'm I think I'm gonna call the series quiet coding so I'll probably have like a playlist on my channel about all my quiet coding stuff so earlier I was just doing a lot of like refactoring every acts of pulling in data from the WordPress API a lot of the same stuff I was doing yesterday so I'll probably I kind of like doing it had my my microphone muted so I didn't really have to worry if somebody came in my office tried to take a phone call or something I just I could just do it and didn't it wasn't really a big deal so not sure if anybody's interested but just one of the less you know since did you all gave me the idea for it I want to let you know that I did try it out and I don't think I'm just trying to think if there's any other big things that happen between yesterday and today and I don't really think so so I'll show you what I'm working on right now I'm just gonna kind of continue on whoops let me start my start my timer here so I I was continuing to try to pull in all the data from WordPress into our react react site or at least as much as I possibly could so that it can be editable within WordPress and nobody has to touch the code so I went through the let me just bring that pull the site over here so I went through some of the pages finished we had done the about page already yesterday so I went through the team page and then now I'm on the courses page and I'm just pulling in the data so what I did have to do on this courses page is make some custom post type so this section and this section these are just normal like pages within WordPress so exactly the same as we have been doing yesterday with some things this little section here is just a page but when we get down to here this now is a custom post type so before the click handler was was actually changing a CSS property to show and hide this now it's it's not the click handler is changing the state and I'll show you in a second and it's showing or hiding based on that database on that so it's our you know three rendering the component so if that doesn't make sense now it'll make sense in a second when I show you the code so these sections and I guess I should bring I have the live set over let me bring this over to show you what it did look like so these sections have images and they have these links these sections don't they're just text but they're similar enough that I thought it's worth a try to try to make one component that could handle all these variations depending on what data gets passed in so that was that was the goal I wanted I wanted one component for all of these things and potentially I suppose the same component could be used elsewhere if we ever add pages on so here's what I came up with so I made a component called expanding section and I it it has its own state and it's simply just display content true or false so really easy but then I have all these you know if that we're not really if statements properly is that you know ternary you know operators but basically I'm checking to see if data is there so the first thing I check for so every section is going to start out and that be wrapped in this subsection div right but the first thing I do right off the bat is check if there's an image so if someone in WordPress has uploaded a featured image to that post then it's going to render this okay which is the template that handles images also once we get down to once we get down to here so you could you see from from this part here just handles that first part this you know this title once we get down to here this is where we show our high based on our state so if state is true then we showed this part within this part I also have a section for this link so we're using that out link component that helps us track so if you remember we we were using react what was a react GA so the google analytics plugin for react and there was a there was a problem with it and that it didn't really work properly if he wanted to set target blank to the link so we made our own kind of wrapper element and it fixed that problem and that was the show whenever we actually submitted the pull request which i've never heard back about that so not sure really what happened maybe that project isn't really being maintained I don't know I never checked on it maybe I'll ask about it if I get a chance it's possible that I know I didn't properly follow the the rules for testing so it's possible that maybe when they saw that they just didn't even look at it but we'll see I think it's worth checking up on again because there are other people that had a similar issue so this could be helpful but anyway if there is a URL added in to our custom post type which I thought I had it on the screen maybe I moved it over oh yeah I did so we can see like the URL here so if a URL is entered then this button gets rendered otherwise it does it doesn't so the other variation then is and then of course it displays our image here the other variation is just the text with or without the link okay so there are potentially right now for variations that could happen on this this component so we could have image text and a link we could just have text and image we can just have text or we could have text with a link I'd like to add one more variation because right now we alternate so I need one more variation to just flip these and alternate so this isn't going to be something that the content manager from WordPress picks I could make it another field to set whether it's right or left but I don't really think that that's important I can it's possible maybe that they would want to do it but in general these types of sections look better if it does alternate so I think I'm just gonna make it so that it always alternates and that can't be changed and I'm more comfortable with that then that way I don't have to rely on whoever is changing the content to realize that it looks better you know alternated so that's one less thing for them to worry about and it'll keep the same look that that we wanted with this alternating thing here this woman here actually works at Franciscan she's super super nice everything every web said I do she always says it's really really great and she loves everything I do so anyway most of these pictures in here these aren't like stock photos these are real people from the University which is cool because normally I work a lot with stock photos this is actually a chapel that's on campus it's a replica of one in Italy so anyway a little side note all right so that's it sort of to finish up this component we just want to make these alternate so the good thing is we don't have to make a whole nother section where we change the HTML at least I don't think we do I'm pretty sure that I can just change let me see how I did it because I did do you use some the way I I laid out this grid with the CSS I made some custom classes that can change the order of where these things are so I'm hoping that that's all I'll need to change if if I can't exactly remember I set this up because I set it up months and months ago on a different project and I just carried it over but if it doesn't work like I wanted to then I can just make this component a bit bigger and copy and paste everything over and then we'll make we'll figure it out but for right now I think it'll be it'll be ok we just need to check out so I guess the easiest way to test this would be I'm going to go here we can see now for this one we have text on left image on right so what I want to do is change I don't know if this is gonna work I'm gonna give you shelter I'm gonna change this order I think my order CSS might only work on a small screen now that I think about it yeah it does ok I think I have it so that it only works on small screens screens right now so that the image always ends up being on top so let me just make sure that's still working like that yeah there we go so this only goes like that all right so the solution then I assume that this is like I'm using a media query to make it so that that only applies here trying to think of what the most the best way to make this happen would be I can put off thinking about it for just a second because what we need to do anyway is we need to figure out which basically whether it's odd or even number alright so and this is not hard and we're probably going to need to do it here when we actually I'm sorry not where am I here we go so when we actually set up and and start going through this component this is where we need to do it so we need to we need to get the index number and then pass it probably will pass it as a problem I think that's the best way all right so if you're not sure what I'm talking about right now it'll be obvious in a second when I actually do it so what I need to do now is get the index number and I'm wondering I don't know if I have to put a bracket there now I'm gonna try it without the bracket hopefully I can do it otherwise I'll put a bracket in and now I need to put the index equals I and then let me save that and find out okay no errors that's good and did it render yeah it's still rendered okay great so we're gonna grab the index we're gonna pass it as a prop to our component now within our component let's I'm wondering if I if I ought to put something in state basically all I need to do is be able to tell if this is odd or an even number I don't think there's necessarily any value in putting that in state we're never gonna have a need to change that after the fact all right so I think we can we can change this I don't really need to do anything else with this with this index so let's change it here might be easier now we'll leave it here and then we won't have to rewrite a lot of this logic and really I don't know if we'll do it it might just be a little nitpicky to do this right now but really I should probably put as much of the logic that's going on here into the components and make it easier to put things in but some of it I think I actually do have to do here to avoid getting some error messages but for now let's move this in here and just say let's say is even I don't know that I even really need to make a component for this or I mean it's like a separate function I could probably do it in line but others do it here that's the right syntax right I don't know why I write this so often I don't know why I'm secondguessing it but I guess it's like when you look at a word that you spelled a million times and it just looks weird to you all of a sudden like you spelled it wrong so let's say index this drops index and I'm going to say oops if it equals I always forget I always have to double check what the correct with the true and false values are for the answers so so what is it like if it's 2 modulo the modulus operator and 2 we get zero so if it's 3 I'm on my other screen I'm just doing a little bit of math ok so that's how it is so what we want so if it equals zero then we're gonna return true because it is even otherwise oh yeah that's right that makes sense I gave me that I had to do the math to figure that out but sometimes this is this easier to just do the math make sure okay that is gonna come through as a number all right so basically what this is doing if you're not familiar with this operator what this does is give you the remainder of what's left over once if you were to divide this number which is our index number by two the it'll give you the remainder so if it's divisible by two we will have no remainder which is y of 0 if it's not divisible by 2 we will have a remainder so that's that's where where all this is coming from and I don't know why I'm getting such weird syntax highlighting did I do something wrong so I'm gonna check my time here and make sure I do check the lodge at oh okay I'm glad I checked the live chat because I'm Berto has just told me correctly that why do I need the true or false couldn't I just do this and it would return true or false I'm better you are correct and also who else Pedro gave that answer as well and and I messed up the arrow function thanks Patrick goodness all right so this is a lot better now oh hey zan is here now Zanna were you here earlier when I was talking about doing the stream earlier based on your idea from like yesterday or maybe was two days ago if not I'll say it again really quickly all right in the in the live chat I'm just gonna read through a bit since I'm I've already kind of paused the bet here John Hanson says I sort of knew a bit of jQuery for about a year then halfway through a project I thought myself your regular JavaScript not bad for sixty never too late to learn yeah that's awesome actually I think I mentioned this before but my dad is 57 I think and he's going to retire this year and I'm trying to convince him to learn a little bit of frontend development and so I'll have to tell them that that it's not it's not too late to learn the Indra has a question how to avoid rearending all react tap wind state change and rendering only children so and then there's some clarification Nikola is asking what kind of state are you talking about component internal state or something like Redux andrew says talking about the big app state want to do it without Redux or flux or set state as simple member and passes props to children okay so Nicola says any component that has its props change will rerender itself meaning if your top components props or state changes everything underneath it will rerender okay yeah so I would say without seeing the code Andrew yeah if you could keep if it's possible to have like keep some state you know within a component that would reduce rerendering everything if you could I'm not really sure I don't know I don't know that I can give you a great answer if it's possible for you to like link to a github repo or something you can like send me a direct message on Twitter or something like that with the link if you don't want to link it in the live chat and then I could try to check it out when I get a chance Gunnar's says hey Jesse hey gunner how's it going thanks for watching okay John Hanson says flex bucket flex block box added a class that can easily change the dome order flex direction row or row reverse so you may not get the toggle left right if the viewer skips one heading all right lift it shake I have to check that out as soon as I get this basically the next step will be whether I want to handle this like with CSS or whether I want to actually make another component so Zanna I just looked at the link that you posted that had pictures of dogs with squishy cheeks oh that's that's uh that's pretty cool made me smile so here's some examples here for you all later watching let me see all right so we had a Cathal asks what theme do you use for Adam I use the SETI theme SETI Oh Sebastian's already answered that sorry I do that all the time you think I would have learned by now to read the next few comments before I answer yeah now I can see that everybody noticed that I messed up my error function before I noticed yeah so this is a Pomodoro so I had a question here in the live chat about the Pomodoro yeah so this is a poem of over timer so what I'm gonna do is use this I use it all the time when I work but I'm gonna use it during the be live streams now to give give me a better idea of just the time when I'm working and also you know every time the timer goes off I will remind me to check the live chat and then after the five minutes is up it'll remind me to go back to coding so I broke off from that a little bit early this time because I suspected that I was doing something wrong anyway so I figured you all would have caught it let's see ok Nicholas but is there a reason you're not setting your initial component state inside the constructor she talks oh I'm not sure are you talking about this component here so oh wait there's a little bit of delay oh wait so Nicola let me know if if I'm in the right spot there also anyway Zanna I think I had asked if you had heard what I said earlier but then I didn't see whether or not you answered me there's a lot of stuff going on so I'll just say it so you had the idea a couple of days ago of me just doing like a quiet stream with I didn't do any commentary but I I just would do my work and you could watch the screen so I actually did that this morning on my own YouTube channel for about an hour and I think it worked out pretty well I didn't have that many people watch it but that was okay because I really liked I didn't I couldn't handle if people were asking questions and stuff because I was just trying to get the work done so anyway I think I'll do that more frequently I think that was that was actually a good idea and I was able to keep my normal workflow and my normal pace it didn't really bother me knowing that the screen was being recorded so so that was a really good idea and I'll do those on my YouTube channel not on free code camp and less like someone from free code camp asked me and says they really want me to do that but otherwise I'm just going to keep doing this this kind of stream for free code camp and then I'll do the quiet stream on my own channel okay Nick alright that makes a lot more sense that one so anyway Nicholas question about the constructor was because he was just joining didn't realize that the component or I'm sorry that that the entire thing was done in in next j/s so let's see alright I think I got through all the questions okay I see Sebastian had me copy and paste something but now I see I'm just gonna I'm going to avoid the potential copy and paste like invisible character errors going on here so I think this is exactly what you had so it's even equal zero this problem and X modulo two equals zero okay so that's cool thanks Sebastian it's always crazy it like never fails that things that you do frequently that work when you're not being watched somehow you seem to mess up when you are was so anyway that's just the way it is all right so we have this now so so now we know whether or not this particular instance of that component is even or odd and okay there's my timer so I will say two I have I have a few things that are like not coding related that I do need to get done before I leave and I have a meeting at 500 so I need to make sure that I have enough time before then to do this stuff so actually one of the things that need to get done I can probably do on the stream so I'm just telling you all mostly so that I hear myself say it and I don't forget but if maybe if one of you also remember you can remind me if I forget towards the end of the stream so I need to make sure that I actually changed the links or tomorrow the site is going live that this one links to so I think I I think I have it up here somewhere so it doesn't really matter so the learning management system that this site needs to link to is going to be live tomorrow it's already live right now I don't know if you can log in or sign up for courses yet but at least the homepage works so I'm just going to link to it today so don't have to work on it tomorrow so I need to do that before I leave so I needed to switch to the master branch add the link in the proper place and then push the code to both of our our servers and make sure it works before I leave today the other thing I have to do is get some data to the head of my department so that she can use it for a meeting that she has on Monday which oh I won't be here on Monday I'm gonna take my kids to an amusement park and so no stream on Monday but I will be back Tuesday alright so having haven't gotten that out of the way let's sort this out now so let's see at this point I kind of just want to I kind of want to just put just take just this section because that's all that would really need right just this section and just say like you know if it's if it's even do it this way if it's all do it that way so I will just copy and paste this which kind of stinks because I don't like to repeat it so much the same stuff but I know like John said that you can do this with Flex box but since I haven't done stuff with Flex box like that at least for a while it'll be faster for me to just switch it around so let me do that now so this date display content so if we are displaying content and let's say n is even don't need up front you do this is even right this is even then we're gonna do it this way yeah we want the first one to be like this so because the first one will be zero so that'll give us a zero so that'll register is even okay and then I don't know I can't I don't want to do it like that I'm sure you all realize my my mistake so no cuz I wanted to either display or not display so what I want to do is make another one inside of this one so I always want the image to have order 1 so I'm going to go through I don't know if this will give me an error or not but it won't take me that long to try it so someone else will try if is even you do this else why did I just copy that again that was silly I also gonna do this and then I'll simply flip this around so it's really ugly now but it'll all get Auto formatted in a minute oh I was so terrible and I need I swim there you go okay uh based on the highlighting this is looking weird I'm not sure to work but yeah it doesn't work okay Isis she's arrived in closing today yeah I need I don't know that that's gonna work alright I'm gonna check the live site so I'm sure you all have been giving me advice while I'm doing this phone this is this seemed like it would be the fastest way it looks like it's a mess but basically the reason it didn't work is because I now then have adjacent elements that aren't enclosed in one element and you can't do that in react so if I want this to work I either need to wrap this in a div which may or may not mess up the formatting it's worth a shot to try I suppose or I need to go out like another level here and you know do this but I'm not anyway I'll check the live chat see what you all think that's what Susanna's comment about me always being polite okay she said I could just do talking for like 20 minutes at the end or after each 20 minutes yeah that's what idea I think was to do like after each like big Pomodoro session to then take a few minutes to talk yeah we'll see yeah I'll try it out and see kind of what the best mix is I did I used to have the idea of just waiting until the end to do all the QA but the problem is if there are too many people in the live chat the the questions that they asked at the beginning get they get deleted they're just there's like a limit so I can't see them anymore so then now I take a few times throughout the stream to check questions okay so all right so say this here need some advice here it says says I should I won't be able to please everyone because I always try to talk to everyone so better focus on the questions related on what you do at the moment and answer the others at the end or find a way that works for you yeah you're right that's that does make sense to try I do i do get sidetracked I I try I guess to save some of those questions for the end but I do occasionally get sidetracked and the reason being like especially if I see someone who's new I haven't seen the chat before even if they ask an unrelated question I really do like to answer them before they leave the chat because I want everybody to feel welcome like after for those of you that I see a lot I know you're not gonna get upset if you know I'll wait to answer your question to a little bit later because I mean you understand like I'm trying to actually get some code done as well so anyway that's why I get sidetracked so I kind of feelings about that I do think it would be easier to follow the stream for you all and I would get more work done if I didn't you know take those little those little side trips to talk to people but I also I do think it's important because I mean you never know they somebody some people come on and say I just started to learn how to code yesterday and I don't want them to get discouraged you know when they're you know when they're just starting out I mean oh it could if they feel like they're being ignored and they just started maybe it took a lot of courage for them to pose so anyway maybe I'm thinking too much into it but I would rather I would rather not be the person that is the reason why they quit coding or or just have a bad day so but I'll probably as more and more people watch this and chat I probably will have to come up with a better way to make sure that I stick to things because they'll just be way too many questions maybe I'll have to get like a moderator or something in the chat and they'll pick out the questions or something okay so John has an idea this is back to being related about to our problem at hand John says could you use an event listener on click to those headings and then toggle like flip the order based on that okay so I don't I don't actually think we need to to change it on click no I don't think we need to because we still it would basically be the same the same problem either way we just need to have like just a slight variation here another set so whether or not we're just checking for even or odd or were we're adding in a click there I think if we added the click we would still need to know whether it's even or odd am I missing something am I missing some reason why we should have a click handler involved in this as well so let me know class thing and I'm getting I'm getting distracted again in the live chat a Sebastian just talked about the YouTube dark theme yeah if you haven't tried out the dark theme on YouTube try it out so you got you all know that I am a fan of the dark theme so I really like it I have found that I did have some things that just weren't working right because it's a newer UI and everything so I did switch back to the the light theme because I couldn't like respond to comments on videos for some reason so it's probably fixed now alright so here's what I'm gonna try I'm just gonna wrap this in a div hopefully this won't mess things up I'm just I'm worried that it'll mess up or something with the knee of the column classes and like the grid system and with materialise but I think it's worth a try so we do a div here and then what do we need hmmm I think I messed up somewhere and pasting yeah I did okay yeah I did myself because that should not be there and then yeah so this this is the right spot no is it no it's not alright I'm gonna I got to think for a second so I can figure out what how I mess these divs up all right so this all right goes all the way up here with that so then we need a div inside directly inside this one right yeah okay so we do need a div that's gonna be I guess here this will need that death we may not need let me see what this one is okay we do need that device so we're good on those these two are necessary within this we're probably gonna need some sort of enclosing just yeah we needed we need a div here to close this column I don't know how I messed this up so badly yeah this has to be close it should have paid more attention when I was copying pasting originally all right so that's there this is the outline Oh actually I don't need it there I need it there should be here there we go okay so that didn't need to go there and then this whole thing ought to be wrapped in closing div all right so we need so it's the class name div no I don't need I don't need this but I need one down here this kind of thing takes the most brainpower it seems like for me than anything just figuring out where I messed up this is this same problem happened to me a few hours ago do you think I would have learned my lesson at least it was easy for me to figure out the problem now since this happened before okay I think all the divs are in their proper places now yes all right awesome hmm all right so that one didn't have why is this doing this so this is not working the way we wanted to I'm gonna refresh okay we'll see so the Maya dev server did quit working so I'm not gonna now don't worry until I get it back up and running I actually did take time this morning and try to figure out why my dev server keeps stopping and I couldn't figure it out I thought like well maybe I should update node on my machine which I did I updated it which is probably I probably needed to update it anyway but the update did not fix it so I tried looking up the error on line and I found some other people that had the same error and the solutions it it didn't work so there were three issues on github about that error but for other nothing with next j/s so it's probably not an XJS problem two of the issues never got resolved and then the third issue the the resolution was just I tried a few things in it but a lot of it like just wasn't really applicable to my situation so anyway the end result was that the time I spent on it I only succeeded in upgrading node but I did not succeed in solving the problem so let me check out I'm gonna inspect this and my dev tools is on one of my other screens right now which I'll bring it over if I need to okay so it seems like wrapping that div around everything is not it's not gonna work which that stinks because I said judge took a lot of effort to make sure all my dad's messed up okay all right so here's what I'm gonna try this son let's take out these divs now I'm gonna try to be very careful when I take these out so I don't mess things up again so there's one and there's the matching one okay and I just need to do that one more time so this is a div so there's one and there's the matching one okay great so I'm gonna I'm just going to confirm that I'm getting the same error yep same air okay so we're back kind of where we started and here's my idea for a solution right now so I think what I'll do is I'm gonna try to add in I'd say I want to try this is I just want to see if it's possible I don't feel like looking it up I'd rather just just do it here's what I want to try I want to I want to do I want to try to put a ternary inside that's her name there's no way there's no way this will work but I think it's cool to try all right so I am gonna need a closing div here and now I'm also gonna need another closing div here and let's see display content so this even so within this all right so this is our alternate and then we go down here and which they're closing trying to find out where our other ternary actually closed I guess it's not there it was there but I don't think that's doing anything okay all right let's see what errors we get all right that's not what I was expecting let me see what I did oh I have a div I don't need any more right if I want to be really excited this actually works it works all right I'm pretty sure we're gonna add in like one more thing just to doublecheck but we didn't get an error like all right so check this up it is in fact possible to nest turn Aries and it works it looks a bit messy it's like a lot of mental effort to keep it all straight for me and it's probably giving a mess if I ever want to come back in here and change it so I don't know that I would ever recommend it or do it again but it definitely works that's really cool I though that was fun I don't know if you all what you all think about it but it's sometimes it's fun to just do things even if you're not sure if it'll work all right I'm gonna check the live chat really quick because I'm sure that that some of you had something to say about what I was doing did my a actually that was great timing all right so I'll do my five minutes now or the live chat let's see okay so John said I have asked before if I was missing something about why we should have a click Handler and John said it's because what if a person skips one or two or three headings will not add an even order in those headings along with the open and close elements oh I see what you're saying now all right so sorry I didn't get that until now so basically the idea was so yeah if everything's open in order let me use this one for an example so if everything does get open you know in order you get the audio in effect right it's nice but what if somebody just skips right so you have to line up here so I hadn't thought about that I think I actually don't think the effect is is bad when there's this gap and there's obvious that there's another one in there because I'm thinking basically what would end up happening I think would be more jarring than this so that if I had these open like this and then I opened this one I guess it honest on a shorter screen it didn't really make a difference but if you could see them both what you would see happening is this one would open up here and then this one would flop it what this would flip flip flop right here so I think I'm okay with this happening but that's definitely a good thought I didn't even occur to me at all yeah so I think I am going to leave it like this but I appreciate I appreciate the thought and you're explaining it to me since I didn't understand right away no man I never noticed this picture is a little bit old so this isn't there we get a new food service vendor for the for the University and I don't think that this is the name of this coffee place anymore so I'm surprised nobody noticed because my boss is usually like he notices every little detail like that she must not actually looked at this picture cuz I bet he would have noticed it I don't think it's the big deal but I think we usually like to not make anything in the image that could give a date so that people don't realize like hey we're using like really old images or something in our sights anyway let me put in one more I'm gonna put in the data for let's see yeah I want to put in the data for one more so that I can actually see if we're getting the correct ordering happening because right now I really I can't tell so think the only one is crucification kind of context FastTrack okay so this is the only one that I haven't put in yet so I'm entering this into WordPress oops and I should probably while I'm doing it I should probably just put in this link like it's supposed to be okay sorry about this this is boring stuff but I definitely think you need to test this before I move on so I was I was pretty sure it wasn't gonna work and so since it did work I'm very I'm still a little skeptical since its appearing to where I Creighton huh it's made this image the other nice thing is that when I get all these images into WordPress I can take them out of the the react app so they don't need to be stored on the same server right now they're not in gonna be tracked and get anymore so it'll make everything just a little bit smaller oh man that's huge image I need to go in and sorry I just lost my train of thought right in the middle oh I need to go in and get better image sizes for this this was on my list of things to do and then I got pushed pushed into doing some other things and never got back to doing the images okay so let's refresh and we should have everything nope all right so I'm really glad I did that because we are not getting the alternating like we want did I actually change the order of these yeah I did okay so this definitely has us a different order all right so what's going on alright I'm gonna check the chat really quick to see if anyone has any ideas if I'm missing something oh yeah Sebastian did say about the dev server it is definitely just this machine because I can use it on my my laptop and the repo works fine and the dev server is fine so I don't know what is going on with my machine okay Patrick addict the idea to refactor those these chunks so I'm assuming you meet within this within this componentry fact there are a lot of this stuff that I'm repeating into stateless components and then that way it'll be a lot easier to read yeah you're right when I first was doing this I didn't think it would get this this huge but maybe I should just make those into components now and yeah that will be so much easier Todd John says Jesse you live on the edge you only learn by being fearless I like that thanks Jeff yeah I mean what like what's the worst that could happen I just get an error message right and then I just you know hit hit ctrl Z or command Z and then it's all good it's back to normal again and I'm using you know get as well so I could just go back to previous commit so why not like it's not like I can it's a local deficit might as well try out whatever I want John I saw you just said he said it could be jarring meaning like the backandforth that I was talking about with the order unless you he said unless you animate JK's yeah I always I always think it'd be cool to animate things and I would like to do it but I just like don't have time right now only because like you all know like I need to be done with this project by neck like by the middle of next week so there's definitely things that definitely things that I would like to do that I'm just not gonna be able to do Sode is asked a few questions hey welcome to the channel I don't think I've seen you in here before so welcome this is we're using JavaScript and it's in particular to react the react framework in JavaScript and sawdust can you teach me and want to be an expert in programming languages please can you teach me well if you watch this you'll get some idea of what my job is like so it's not exactly like a teaching like tutorial based thing I am gonna release some videos on my own channel hopefully sometime soon if I can quit having these crazy deadlines and those will be more tutorial oriented if you have any specific questions or want me to check out your code you can direct message me on Twitter and I'll try to check everything out when I get a chance yeah and Sudd said would you say PHP yeah so I did a little bit of PHP for this a custom plugin for WordPress so everything else has been JavaScript okay so Sebastian is giving me some alternate syntax that may be able to help me out here okay and see let me let me show you let me show you some of what is being pasted in the live chat so I said didn't didn't catch everything so something like this okay so let me so I'm getting some some good advice here in the chat so let me let me go back in here and let's try to do so basically I don't need to nest my statements or wait let me see what school all right so basically this is this syntax is is saying I just want to make sure I had it right before I told everybody's sorry for the pause saying if it even then do something else don't do anything so you're saying basically so I can basically get rid of like areas where I'm using like the question mark and the I'm trying to find an example oh if I'm on the wrong page that's why sorry yeah so like normally I use the question mark and then the here so I wouldn't need to use those then but I think in this case I I do need the else right so for like for this if it's even I need to render this if it's not even so I need that else I neither under this correct now for these ones I could try that out for these ones right because I'm rendering nothing here so I could get rid of so and so this so like for this one I could do this props URL oh actually I don't know if I could do it because I'm not checking for true or false here I'm checking to see if it's if it's blank so this was probably only work if what I'm checking for would be true or false if I'm checking for anything else then I couldn't miss I might not be able to do it or could I still do it but I would just have to put the end right here all right so let me let me share this and then I could do this alright cool let me just see because this should I'm pretty sure that that part of the template is the one the only one is rendering right now cool really cool I don't know what this this should actually have a link in it I want to double check to make sure that the link is there I guess I never put put the link in so it should have one okay I'm gonna get rid of these as well inside here cuz I don't I don't want to see the doubles anymore that'll shorten this up a bit okay okay let's make sure Ricky okay let me bring over it's a little awkward right now I had my terminal underneath this the window that I was the live chat was on so I'm gonna bring it over bring it over here so you all can see what I'm doing on the terminal as well okay son I see I see you gave me your email they're just uh do you have a github profile where you have your codes so you could give me the link to that then I could check that out also all the links to all my social media stuff are linked up somewhere in the description this video some are links from my youtube account so you can you could contact me in a variety of ways but if you want to send me a link to your github then then I can check that out okay cabbie and says the the empty string is false II so I don't even have to have that so where was I at here so I should be able to just do this right yeah I just thought the same thing Patrick so Patrick put in the live chat you titled this refactoring you're getting a lot of refactoring advice yeah I accept itíll this refactoring because I wasn't sure what else to call it but I was only billing some refactoring but I thought I don't think I've ever titled a video refactoring so let's let's do that and now it's it it's actually nearly entirely refactoring at this point so it was appropriate Oh Patrick just had a good idea saying that I should try cloning into a new directory on my machine to see if that will fix the server issue I'll have to try that I I had not tried that yet so I'll try that out if that works that will be awesome all right let me let me see all right so did I say that let's see make sure that really works okay cool whoa did you all see this somehow I'm getting the images now right how is this rule where are these coming from they are in fact coming from WordPress so I don't know what I did I didn't do anything but now all of a sudden the images are working and you've seen that like they'd never work locally they'd always oh well I'm not complaining all right so basically what we need to do then is figure out why it's not flipping the order like we wanted to and rendering this other thing maybe my nested ternary operator just does not work and that's certainly possible we could also let's see I said only to let me um I'm gonna check on dev tools and I'll bring this over to the other screen now since it may be beneficial for everyone to see this so I'm gonna check on dev tools and see what exactly the props are that are being passed here to make sure we're getting the right index okay so this one has an index of one so we should be getting okay this was index zero all right so it looks like the index yeah that's that's what we want so we should be getting like true and false alternating but we're not all right so let's put in oops this oh no I forgot this I even made sure that I use the arrow function so that this would work okay cool so now we're getting what we need so we have false true false true false who so we're getting a value so then the problem is we can at least move down here and see maybe it's within our return area just can't show those persons okay our bad I see since you've been using this props URL a number of times so I can D structure that to Const URL this props yeah I probably could do some D structuring I'm gonna I'm not gonna do it right now because if I turn these into I want to see like how much I can reduce the usage of it by turning these into their own components okay so let me see I was just reading I'm reading all the the advice here and the live chat I probably should have read it out loud sorry to everyone who had to sat through that silence I think someone mentioned I should be calling it like that oh that was it all right let me let me figure out who said that so I can thank you properly I can't believe I miss that heavy in art so Kevin thank you so much so here's the problem I was using this even this is even instead of actually calling it like that and that was it that was the problem it's crazy because I even did it the right way up here so really good catch with that one awesome so now our even odd thing is working and I need to switch the order of this but I'm not gonna do it on the stream because I'm actually gonna do it in WordPress I'm just gonna change the date the published date of this to make it publish after and then everything will be in the right order all right awesome so this is the this needs to be populated with a huge list but I'm not worried about that now I might I might not even do it myself I might have the Amy who's doing the content management put all that that data in I should probably have her do some of this anyway and then that way it'll be like training for whenever I'm not working on this anymore all right awesome so the courses page works now we should probably clean this mess up alright so I'm gonna let me get rid of this I don't need this but I'm gonna commit this because it works and then we'll refactor and if I make a big mess of everything at least I will have a working version that's been committed that I can always go back to whoa okay I gotta get rid of I originally had different components for each one of those before I changed my mind and did it in just all one component so there we go also this is no I was gonna say it'll make everything look nicer and it'll be easier to work with where do we add please fix them okay I forgot to remove that that's an easy fix so I was directly using out link and since I moved it into this component I don't need it anymore so that was the the air there so let's do that again great all right looks like I have an update for NPM available all right cool so while that does this thing let's work on this oops okay so first of all first of all oh I'm gonna try to figure out what should be put into its own stateless functional component and so basically things that I'm I'm repeating are really good candidates or potentially things that I might not be repeating now but I could see you needing to repeat elsewhere somewhere else on the site are also good candidates for this all right so let's see I guess this could be this probably could be I'm kind of hesitant because I don't really want to do the work of doing the click and then sending the data back and all that so let's we'll see oh I mean I'll do it if it really seems like I obviously should do it let me see how many times I use that twice actually that is a really good candidate I think because I potentially this could be used in other parts of the site too all right let's do it the reason I didn't want to do it is because I have done it before where I I have a clique that changes state and apparent component but I've only done it like twice and so I'm not real sure about it so since I've already messed up so much on today's stream I'm not in a hurry to do it again but oh whoa I guess there's only it's the only one way to really learn something and remember it and that's to keep doing it in practice so let's do it I definitely need to change the song I'm listening to it because it's really annoying all right let's see so we're gonna call this component I'm trying to get a name for this component try to name it like based on what it does since it's gonna have a click handler basically it's gonna show hi but it doesn't necessarily have to show hide the click could do other things it really it makes sense with the way we're handling this SVG that it is a show hide but it doesn't necessarily have to be so I guess I'll just call it click heading alright cuz it's it's an h3 tag it's a heading and you click it yeah cuz a lot of stuff I could potentially make a lot of the stuff in here changeable based on the props so it could be pretty versatile alright so let's do that let's call it click heading Oh what happened oh I shoulda used to wait what's that I remember someone gave me the advice of how to use the command to use if you've accidentally run something that you should have run in sudo and there's a way to run it in sudo without having to type everything out again it was like s Oh with with two exclamation points awesome what's wrong one use my password for my labs up and not for this machine alright cool thank you so much for giving me that command so quickly it's been a really long time since I had to use it so I didn't remember wait a second alright cool it worked that was really fast I thought it was an error for a second because it was so fast but let's touch components and Woody's is gonna be click heading all right so now we have this component and I had I hid this earlier just to give some more give us some more space I'll probably decide it again if you use atom this is actually really cool light I used atom for years before I even realize this shortcut command so like you know the slash that shares a key with the question mark I can't ever remember which ones forward session which was back slash that one automatically comments something for you but if you use the other slash the one that's just below the backspace or delete key depending on what it says on your keyboard that one shows in hi it's this little thing in the corner super useful alright so so we're gonna do let's take let's see if I have a stateless functional component to just steal from and I don't oh sorry yawning I didn't have my normal energy drink today before the stream so I'm a little tired yawning said I had no no G fuel to the hey alright so I'm I want to try to type this component out without copying because it might actually be faster than trying to find one and I think I can do it so I import react we can import reactant reacts and we're gonna do Const and what do we call this click heading equals alright now I'm stuck now I need to look all right let's see which one did we do this with there use it with this now we didn't I don't know that we have any in here because this one was one but then we added I think we added State to it okay I'll have to check my other my other project I know I use them in my side project that I'm doing for my course right now so I will check that okay Sebastian Sebastian has my back there we go props I couldn't remember what went in there just FYI I've only probably built maybe three stateless functional components so far in my entire life so that's why I can't remember the syntax ok this probes and then just put the brackets I can't remember I don't think I need the brackets right no I just need parentheses right okay all right so that's all I need for the beginning and then I need to export it and I don't need this what I need my that's what I want Oh click heading why did i camelcase that when I needed to capitalize this I'm gonna have to rename it I don't know what I was thinking okay all right so that should work I'm going to need to copy over sorry h3 all right so how h3 let's figure out what props we need to pass in so we need to make a click function here to handle the click and change the state in our parent component and so in here I'll put this so this is going to be doing the same thing now on click what we want to do is and see what am i I think I'm doing something similar in another component so let me let me look on my other screen I have my other project open so that I can just check this before I start fumbling around okay all right so that should be good I know we're calling it clickhandler here but I want it to be do I want this no I don't want it to be because yeah I want this to be reusable for other things other than just showing content so I don't want to call it that so I guess we could just call it click click Handler and we'll just so we'll have the proper name the same thing all right yeah and okay cabbies I see I don't really even need this part right I can get rid of that because I'm not doing any anything other than just saying there's a clique I don't need to pass any data okay all right so over here let's pull in this component and click it all right so click heading there and click heading all right so we definitely want to pass as clickhandler so will this a penny this okay and what else will we need we need to pass the state down and then we need the title okay it's my content it's gonna be this states content and then title I'd off to be rendered this profs title rendered okay so now we can do trops display content and drops title all right let's check it out what did I mess up nineteen I mess this up up here copied over an extra one maybe that was it this drops click Handa is not a function where I do that Google Chrome thinks that my this error message is is Catalan so it's s wants me to translate it I wonder what it would translate to interesting there we go whoa all right definitely messed something up let me see alright I'm gonna check and checking the live chat quickly alright let's say there's some discussion in the live chat about Lanie's commands okay Kevin so yes I removed the parentheses let's see okay I didn't remove them here okay I forgot no wait I did but I did pull the side one did I do this right these props title render this props title twice the title not being rendered actually yes you'd Sarah's in the lab chat hey Sarah glad you could join us okay I'm gonna need to probably wrap this up and do a few more things before I have to go I have a meeting with a potential client later on for a side thing I'm not sure if I'm going to do the website is gonna be like a really basic WordPress website I'm just not sure that I'm really interested in doing it but the person that wants me to do the site is a friend from from high school and she was friends with my wife and so I felt bad because she hired somebody to do this WordPress site and she was gonna pay him $250 up front and then $250 when they were done and all they had to do the first step of all they had to do was just redirect a domain name which is no big deal and then just kind of like make the theme look a little bit better potentially probably just find a better theme and just apply that theme instead of the old theme so it was really basic stuff and I think it's been months I think it's been since December and she hasn't heard from this person and she already paid him half the money so I feel bad so I still kind of don't want to do the sightly I'm not excited about doing the work at all but I do feel bad and I don't really I don't know we'll see I'll see what she wants I'm at least gonna meet with her and see what she wants for the site and if it's something I can do really quickly I guess I'll do it and maybe I'll just say like whatever you're gonna pay the other guy just pay me the rest of it you know whatever's remaining which will probably 250 and then and I'll just finish up I did he did do some work but I found like a test WordPress site but it wasn't great looking all right so as a as I was going off on the little tangent there about my meeting I was trying to look through this and try to figure out why the title is not showing up actually let me look there's my dev tools that I want to see what the what's being passed down to these components spanning section click heading okay so it looks like it's not getting the say it's not even showing up that there's this title prop at all this props title rendered Oh because it's not title rendered right because we're inside of a component we're passing the data in as title right so let me see on our course page every way I can just see where I'm using title elsewhere right this props title yeah I don't have to put render that's the problem okay oh my this should should fix the problem yep there we go all right great so our clique still work and now we've taken some stuff out into a component awesome so now we can replace all of our h3s which i think is just to not not a huge improvement but still helps I mean that when it's all spread out like that that's you know that's a number of lines right there that's all right save that just check make sure it's working yep I mean dear refresh just to check for sure okay great actually you'll see this why is there a gap between this and this that's weird I don't like that that's weird okay see all these other sections are 35 pixels tall and this one's 54 pixels tall why is that it's not leave its the site isn't being defined anywhere what is going on because this h3 you see this tip here probably don't think I can see is there's it just as classic let's take that so that would be the second option here and it would be this div right well there's not there's no difference that I can see here in terms of in the code it looks the same but inin dev tools they have different heights oh I may have to wait and just figure that out at a different time because I gotta add a move on here alright so oops where am I kind of save I'm not sure what I edited but save it click heading all right so I got a switch to master and make one update before I go yeah I see sarah said CSS though yeah it's got to be something with the CSS oh off to look for that I don't want to do right now sometimes if CSS stuff is just pretty boring it's just a lot of like clicking on elements and seeing what comes up in dev tools so I don't think that'll be that fun to have on the stream and I got a yes it's um I have a meeting in less than 45 minutes so I need to get this done so I'll do one of the things I have to do I can do on stream and that'll be fine the other thing is just me getting data out of Salesforce like manually actually copying pasting data and doing math with in a Google sheet so that's not gonna be fun to show and has nothing to do with coding it's just a test that I wish I could automate I can't get right now so now let's go to the all right whether I page you will be the courses page let me refresh yeah okay so definitely I'm gonna make this a link and I probably should make I'm not sure that people will realize that this is a link but I'm going to just make that like they in the last meeting I had that they wanted this to be a link but I think I ought to put something maybe right under here have a button like this kind of button but under here I'm just not sure what to call it we we threw out some ideas at the meaning on what to call it and it never came to a decision on what we should call the button and I don't really have time to talk to everybody and get them I'm not even sure if anybody's still here I mean it's after 400 on a Friday I'm sure a lot of people are gone I'd hate to call the button just say go but I don't want it to be too long like I could say if there's a Franciscan oh I don't know if you'll have any ideas yeah I know I uh yeah I don't know who's gonna expect to click that's what I said I didn't think anybody was gonna expect to click on the title because we don't really have clickable titles anywhere else on this page and pretty much nowhere except for the the blog the news page do we have clickable titles so but anyway they wanted to be clickable so I'll just make it clickable but I do need to put a button of this style up here I think they they kind of wanted like two buttons side by side they still want this link to the PDF of more information see the originally this was supposed to be the link to go to Franciscan at home calm and I only threw the PDF in there as a placeholder but now they want to keep it and so it was gonna be really simple I was just gonna replace the link but now I actually have to do something else all right well I may as well just throw some things in here see what they look like so what's this course is all right so now we're back to the the old version of the courses phase all right so here's what we have here's our button so let's put it here let's see what it looks like oops I put in the wrong spot here we go this is where it needs to go oh well not I don't really like that too that much all right let me see I'm gonna take the live chat since I was see if anyone has any ideas Kevin in response to the Google I mentioned I was doing some stuff in Google sheets the Google sheet automation is not a problem because that's done in just JavaScript so it's not really a big deal the problem is on the Salesforce side of things is getting the data out of Salesforce and into the Google sheet the data that I need because it's not just Salesforce it's some like old plugin that I'm not really thrilled with for Salesforce so I can't even use like the normal documentation for doing things in Salesforce also the account that I've been given doesn't really let me do that much so even if I knew how to do it I probably don't even have access to send that data to the Google sheet and then I'm also getting data I am getting data from another Google sheet so I'd have to pull in data from two different places in the sheet which is not a big deal in terms of the Google sheet but anyway so for Salesforce that's that's the problem like it it probably I mean in the long run it would probably be good to learn how to do that but I'm just I haven't had a great experience with that particular like plugin that we're using I'm not really impressed with it and the documentation for it is is terrible like and actually nonexistent for a lot of things so it's just really hard to figure out how to do anything I don't know if anybody else has ever worked in like higher education before but the people who provide like software and web services for our education like the products are not good but I always try to say positive things as I say it nicely as I can but they're not good I'm really really really disappointed and everything even like the service like asking them for things or like can we do this or could you do it's just really really bad and even to the point where like when I've actually gone in and changed code to make it better and told them like hey you know feel free to give this to your other clients because I'm sure they need to do the same thing too and we're not talking like big deal stuff just simple stuff like making making things responsive so that they work on a phone things that people expect to get and the response was like no we're not gonna give it to anybody like well are you serious that's gave you this free free code but and that the excuse basically the whole reason was they're trying to get people to pay more money for a different product that was going to be responsive and so they didn't want to update their old product anymore even though everybody was still in their old product they had only sold their new product to one school anyway sorry for the rant it was just really frustrating so if anybody wants an idea for an industry where you could probably break into and do a great job it would be in services for higher education because if you do a halfway decent job you will be better than most of the services that are out there right now all right really the only thing that's stopping me right now is from finishing this is just figuring out what to call this this button and normally I wouldn't care so much but I know if I call us something that the people in charge of this project don't like I'm gonna get called either in like an hour when I'm at a meeting or tomorrow morning or something they're gonna call me and say can you change the name of this button I really want to say begin I think this came up with like basically the idea of saying something like begin is they didn't like that because they didn't want people to think that they're like immediately starting a course I think people are like smart enough to know that they're not gonna immediately start the course especially if we're gonna keep this as learn more I need to get rid of this this border at the top maybe I have that margin top yeah I need to get rid of that don't need that margin there we go that looks better all right let me change this there we go I just want to make sure okay yeah it is it is in fact up so this is the site that it's being linked to the learning management site that's better than air okay and let's make this title a link so I'll grab this and oh I did it again I went to the wrong title keeps rolling up too much is this one that I want now probably I need to work with this color it might automatically change the color yeah dead so let me make this like text all right cool all right so now this can be clicked or this can be clicked and I mean their links they should work but I'm just gonna click alright cool and I wish they would have used the same color favicon up here I'm not sure where they even got that one I guess they made it by they I mean like the company that built this oh well I kind of wish that they'd consulted me more about the design so that it could have been consistent so like they're little things like a lot of like borderradius shadows things like this like this is not the behavior that happens on all of our other sites when we have an interaction with a button so yeah these are all I don't know I mean it's not like the information wasn't available about how to do this there's lots of sites lots of our sites that already use this and we have a style guide so oh well I just have this fear that at some point I'm going to be asked to redesign all this to match the University style and I've been assured by my bosses that that's not gonna happen but at one point I was not supposed to be working on this site either and that happens so I'm still like not convinced that it's not gonna happen and if it is gonna happen I'd rather just know it now then have a situation like this where I get pulled in at the last minute and and do this I would have liked to have had more time oh well that works let's commit that okay let's go to our servers so that'll do its thing an update and then we'll update the other server all right and while that's working i'll check the live chat and i need to keep an eye on the time to make sure i can update the data as well before I go so I may not be able to get to everything in the live chat so I apologize in advance for that but I scrolled up about halfway in the chat I don't think I missed anything from the beginning okay I'm gonna skip it it looks like there's some discussion about them and different things and some different Linux commands stuff so I'm gonna skip over a lot of that just for time and try to get to everyone's questions even though I'm sure there's some good information within those conversations I'll try to read them a different time if I can okay so Sebastian says stop your dev server go into the project folder and delete the the dot next folder check if your dev server works okay if it doesn't then clone the repo in a new folder all right awesome I'm gonna try that not right now but I'm definitely gonna try that so thank you John Hanson asks what happens when that course page gets really long with some kind of pagination or something some other system need to be built into the code it's possible right now it's the course section is not supposed to get longer so this is gonna stay pretty fixed for now and this will pretty much be be fixed but if that happens then I guess I'll have to build something in at that point it could be something like that it could be potentially like decreasing the font size and doing two columns although on a small screen that wouldn't it would still be large so I have to come up with something for that but I don't think it's supposed to grow any soon so so we'll see it actually it's taken a lot of time to build like each one of these because there's they have to do like video production and editing and everything for each one of these courses and so they'll be along you know a period of time of developing it before this would ever get added so I should I should have time to to do that if necessary okay Saad I thanks for giving me your github account so that's cool I'll check it out and then yeah let me know like any specific questions that you have about your code or anything you want me to look at in particular send me a message on on Twitter or I guess you could put it in the comments in the video I mean I'm more likely to see it directly if you put it on Twitter so that's probably the most reliable way to get in touch with me oh don't worry son don't worry about it you're not bothering me not at all yeah I just XANA you say you're out dressing your dog cuz it got colder so is that like legit your dog has a sweater on now or something is that Kevi and i just saw you're talking about the I just noticed the component is not stateless it needs state to know if it renders the SVG rotated or not or it may receive the orientation for the triangle in a prop yes so it does receive it and I'm sure you probably saw that afterwards but yeah we just passed the state from the parent component down to the child in a prop and then the child doesn't really need to to have its own state which I can't see right now but now that you're think you're saying that I wonder I'm probably not gonna change it now but I was just kind of wondering like would it have been better no it wouldn't have been but I was I was wondering if the that component for the headings should have had its own state but I don't think it because I needed to use that same that state to show and hide in the other parent component so it's better I think for that state to live there especially if I put the content sections into their own component then that needs to be able to pass that same state down to two different components so I think it's better to just keep it in the parent and passed it as props to the children components but I may be mistaken if there's some good reason why I shouldn't do it like that I would like to know and you're asked if anybody has worked with graph QL I haven't worked with graph QL yet I mean I've like mess around a little bit with it but not not any serious work with it but I'm really impressed with what I've seen so far and I'd like to use it more Oh kevie and I see you're saying that for a debug tip render the props inside a pre tag in the stateless component cool thanks for that tip Santa said never worked for your distant family or friends yeah I'd I know I like all the clients that I still have better recurring clients are all either family or friends and it's like you can't what am I gonna say tell them I'm not gonna do this anymore I mean I guess if I had somebody that I don't know I don't know I like keep thinking maybe I should just get like subcontract the work that's somebody but even then like it's not enough money for it to be worthwhile for anyone like I have a client right now that's a family friend and last month I didn't even send him an invoice because they only owed me like 12 dollars I thought it's not really worth my time to even create and send an invoice for $12 so I'll have to see but I think this month they're gonna owe me less than $30 and I'm like thirty dollars a little bit better but is it really worth my time to actually like take time on a Saturday or something and you know go into the invoicing software and send it I don't know it's but it's it's hard to quit B it's hard to to get rid of a client that is a friend or family member so I just never should have done it anyway I should have said No Leonard's ass how often do you stream this type of project is this ongoing in parts and actually it looks like everybody already answered that question all answered for the sake of people watching this maybe later on I do stream Monday through Friday usually at 200 p.m. Eastern Time occasionally I have to change the time and occasionally I'm not able to stream on a day but I usually will put it on Twitter like earlier in the day to let let everyone know whether there's a time change or whether I can't do it okay I'm seeing all the stuff now that everyone said about the like the weird spacing between those two headings so thanks for that I'll take a look at that later on too and try some of those things okay I see Sarah that you had said maybe don't make it a button just a link so sorry I didn't see that earlier so at this point I'm just gonna keep it as a button because I'm running out of time but maybe at some point I'll see how it looks like just as not a button in just the length hey Jeremy so if you're watching yesterday you may remember that Jeremy had a job interview today and Jeremy just came in the live chat and said that he got the job so awesome congratulations super excited for you so yeah awesome if if you're able to come back to a stream in the future please let us know how the jobs going that's really cool yeah Patrick I just so you said about the button animation very 1999 and moves in a very incorrect way yeah I agree I'm not really a big fan of the button animation on I guess I closed it out but earlier I had the site yeah this button I'm not really sure about this button animation because it the way it graze it out usually when something's grayed out like that that means that it's not clickable like it's not it's disabled so it's a little bit odd and it you know moves sideways and down which it makes it look like you've already clicked it when you when it's down so it's just it's it's not the animation doesn't really make sense for the purpose of that element so it's a little odd and then on top of that it's just this is not then you know we have a certain way of doing animation on buttons that we use across the board on all our sites and this is not that way so I think it's better to keep it consistent okay then I just saw that about the the project yeah I'm not sure let me so I am I'm gonna meet with the fraud I'm gonna meet with the client here it's very soon and actually I'll see what they want and and then I'll see if it's worthwhile if it's if it seems like maybe I'll let you all know if maybe one of you are up for doing it and Zanna maybe all depending on how the meeting goes maybe I'll send you a message on Twitter and let you know if if it's even worthwhile but that would actually be cool it's I think it's gonna be a really easy project like I don't even think it's gonna involve much coding at all it's just gonna be like customizing a wordpress theme most likely and that's you know that's that's not really a big deal so anyway I have got to go now so I need to get this data updated in about five minutes and then go luckily my meeting is only a few minutes away by car so I should still be able to get there on time but Kevin hey how's it going Kevin's here from Trinidad so glad you could join us sorry I'm about to end the stream so sorry you came in right at the end but you'll be able to watch the recording in just a few minutes it'll be available on on this channel in the free code Kent Channel so anyway thanks everyone for all your help today and let's see oh this is Friday right so have a great weekend and I'll see everyone on Tuesday so no stream on Monday and not working on Monday Tuesday I'll see you if anybody has any other questions he's helped with anything Twitter is the most reliable way to get a hold of me so you can message me on there otherwise I'll see everyone on Tuesday and again thanks so much for watching and all your help have a great weekend
