With timestamps:

00:06 - everybody welcome to live coding with
00:08 - Jessie today we're going to continue
00:11 - with the styling that we were doing
00:13 - yesterday so I did a little bit of work
00:15 - on it
00:16 - between yesterday stream and now so I'll
00:20 - catch you up with the work that I have
00:23 - done and then we'll keep at it let's see
00:29 - I did want to let you all know in case
00:34 - anybody can make it to the the node
00:40 - member conference that I'm going to be
00:41 - speaking at Nashville at the end of
00:43 - November I don't know if anybody is in
00:44 - that area or is planning on being there
00:47 - but if you are I know when and where I
00:51 - will be speaking so I thought I'd share
00:54 - that with you all you can go on the
00:56 - November site and check it out whenever
00:57 - you want but I just figured I'd I put
01:02 - that on there so I will be on Tuesday it
01:06 - will be Tuesday November 20 I think it's
01:09 - a 28th at 4:00 p.m. so not bad get this
01:17 - timeslot right before the keynote
01:19 - speaker so I don't know if that's as
01:21 - good or bad but I'll be one of the last
01:24 - speakers all right so let me get I don't
01:31 - have my live chat window open yet let me
01:33 - get that open
01:41 - okay
01:46 - it looks like someone was kneeling so AR
01:53 - wants me to link the site I'm gonna put
01:55 - a link to the site that we're working on
01:57 - and the live chat right now all right so
02:06 - I've changed some some minor details but
02:09 - I think there are important details not
02:11 - everybody who would notice them but it's
02:14 - important for consistency so it's going
02:19 - to be hard to tell without a
02:20 - side-by-side of the old version but what
02:23 - we've done is we've added a different
02:25 - shadow and we've changed the border
02:28 - radius before the border radius was
02:30 - three pixels now it's two pixels that
02:32 - might not seem like a big deal but we
02:35 - use two pixels for everything unless
02:39 - something's changed the last time I
02:41 - checked for material design the standard
02:44 - was a two pixel border radius so we
02:47 - switch that up we have the proper
02:50 - shadows now the shadows were different
02:53 - we have a new button the colors may or
02:58 - may not change I just copied these over
03:00 - from another form that I had done so we
03:04 - have let's see we're gonna have to
03:07 - change that border radius so I was right
03:09 - in the middle getting this button
03:12 - changed whenever I started the stream so
03:15 - let's make sure that that border radius
03:18 - is correct we now have the correct
03:19 - shadow and the correct effect when we
03:22 - hover over it okay we've gone with the
03:27 - all-caps for the text and a slightly
03:31 - thicker for the font the font so all
03:36 - changed to we're going to change the
03:38 - font family and then other than changing
03:42 - the font family changing the color of
03:45 - these it's probably the last thing that
03:48 - we need to do yeah because this this
03:51 - effect is exactly what I want so I'm
03:54 - really glad that this is the default
03:56 - effect that way we don't have to worry
03:59 - about trying to
04:00 - like this okay
04:03 - all right so let's finish up with this
04:06 - button let's change these colors and
04:08 - then we'll try to get the correct font
04:12 - in here so let me see right now what
04:18 - those are no this isn't the right I have
04:22 - a lot of dev tools windows open right
04:25 - now okay so this actually has a three
04:35 - pixel border radius right now as well oh
04:38 - look at that we did we definitely don't
04:45 - want that so that's the bond focus all
04:49 - right good to know I'm glad we that we
04:54 - caught that so let's go over to our CSS
04:57 - so I've since we're adding so much to
05:01 - our CSS I started putting in some some
05:04 - comments just to break it up so all
05:05 - these are for the navbar these are for
05:08 - the cards this is for buttons so
05:10 - hopefully it'll make it easier if we
05:13 - ever have to come back to this or
05:15 - somebody else has to come back and edit
05:18 - this at some point it'll make more sense
05:22 - all right so first of all let's take
05:26 - this good button focus okay that'll get
05:37 - rid of those styles that we saw briefly
05:40 - forgot my period oops and I forgot to
05:43 - check the chat and start my timer so
05:47 - let's get the timers started wherever it
05:50 - is it is okay so let me do 25 minutes of
06:01 - coding and then we'll take a five-minute
06:02 - break and I'll come to the live chat so
06:03 - if you have a question just hang on for
06:05 - 25 minutes and then I'll get to your
06:07 - question
06:11 - see cool Andrew in the live chat said
06:14 - I'm a big fan so thank you so much
06:17 - that's that's awesome that's actually
06:22 - really cool that my stream has fans
06:25 - anyway I'm glad you're here
06:27 - glad you're in the live chat and unable
06:29 - to join us so I really appreciate you
06:36 - all who are able to join in the live
06:37 - stream I appreciate everyone watching
06:42 - but it's also really cool to have that
06:45 - feedback in the live stream it's
06:47 - definitely a different vibe whenever
06:49 - there's nobody did my camera oh no ok I
06:53 - thought it froze for a second but I was
06:55 - looking at a different preview so we did
06:58 - anyway what I was trying to say was it's
07:02 - a it's just a different feel when
07:03 - there's not that many people in the live
07:06 - chat I I don't know if it's bad I
07:10 - wouldn't say it cause say it's bad but
07:12 - it's just it's very different so I kind
07:15 - of like when there's when there's more
07:17 - activity a hard shot I said you tested
07:20 - the print view and PR 50 in the bulletin
07:22 - I have not tested it yet so I'm gonna
07:25 - test it soon probably I'll get back to
07:31 - that project when I'm done with this but
07:37 - like I think I mentioned yesterday I
07:38 - really just want this to be ready I'm
07:40 - just I'm getting a little bit nervous
07:42 - because no one's been talking about it
07:45 - here I don't know what the due date is
07:48 - I'm just nervous that I missed something
07:50 - or that it's not gonna be ready when it
07:52 - needs to be ready so I'm trying to get
07:54 - ahead of things oh you know what I just
07:57 - saw - we don't want this color - the
07:59 - underlined so we need to change that as
08:01 - well so we're gonna we've already put in
08:06 - the code you know we didn't we need to
08:08 - put in border-radius
08:17 - two pixels and that should take care of
08:24 - it okay
08:27 - you know let's let's check this let me
08:33 - bring over my dev tools window and let's
08:43 - pull this to the side so we can see what
08:45 - we want to see here and yeah this is
08:50 - definitely the input
09:00 - interesting
09:03 - okay yeah this is what we want so on
09:07 - focus we want to change the color
09:10 - awesome alright so let's grab this and
09:17 - we'll change that color button so let's
09:22 - let's put in input
09:40 - let's let's put in this yellow so I
09:47 - don't know if you remember from probably
09:50 - stream a long time ago probably months
09:51 - ago we had some discussion about the the
09:55 - color this yellow color that's in the
09:57 - palette so this is color I'm talking
10:00 - about and in its original version it's
10:05 - just too light to use on the web it's
10:07 - hard to read so I converted it to this
10:13 - format and was able to darken it just a
10:18 - bit and then that little change made it
10:23 - much easier to read so on a button it's
10:26 - not a big deal but if you I rarely
10:30 - rarely do font like this but on like a
10:34 - thin thick place like this then it it's
10:40 - useful to have it just slightly darker
10:43 - so it's it's it's almost you'd have to
10:45 - have the colors right next to each other
10:47 - to really tell the difference but it's
10:50 - that little bit of Darkness really helps
10:52 - so I kind of like that I think it's the
10:56 - third it was a hue saturation light and
11:00 - I don't remember what the last one is I
11:04 - think that's what it is
11:05 - so anyway I believe it's this third
11:08 - value here that you need to change to
11:11 - darken or lighten an image or I'm sorry
11:14 - a color okay so this is that's right
11:20 - that's what we want now let's grab this
11:25 - and I want to do two things to this
11:30 - actually text occasion
11:36 - so we want to change the color first of
11:40 - all but then we also want to make sure
11:42 - that we have a text-decoration:none no
11:45 - matter what I don't really like the
11:47 - underlined I think the cursor:pointer
11:49 - will be fine I'm assuming we have that
11:52 - yeah we do it should be by default on an
11:55 - a tag anyway so let's grab all goodness
11:59 - this is just the default a style all
12:02 - right then
12:06 - ling-su we want to put this I almost
12:14 - want to put the styles that are more
12:17 - Universal you know for a base element
12:21 - like an a tag up at the top so let's put
12:26 - that at the top that I know I didn't
12:28 - copy out yet let's see
12:47 - all right let's see what color I don't
12:51 - want this blue but I do want whoa is
12:58 - that for some reason we just got a
13:01 - refresh it's okay
13:03 - I want to I'm okay with the blue color
13:13 - let's check out what we're currently
13:16 - using here okay here we're using this
13:25 - blue this blue is in the color palette
13:27 - but I'm not really a big fan of it for
13:31 - the web so let's see I'm pretty sure we
13:38 - have links here
13:49 - okay so we are using that yellow for
13:51 - links okay we could try that I'm a
13:55 - little bit hesitant to put the yellow
13:57 - text right next to the yellow button it
14:01 - might be too much so maybe we switch up
14:05 - the button the only reason I really like
14:08 - yellow for a button as it stands out now
14:10 - this isn't really a call to action so
14:12 - mut I'm not that worried about it but
14:15 - for for a button that would be more of a
14:17 - call to action I do like the yellow
14:19 - stands out all right let's just see
14:21 - since we have the hex code right here or
14:23 - I shouldn't say the hex code because
14:25 - it's not what we're using but since we
14:29 - have this here we'll try that first if
14:34 - not I'm gonna try to track down a blue
14:36 - color that I know I'm using in a few
14:39 - other sites that I do like better oops I
14:44 - forgot we're not I don't have library
14:47 - though alright so that was a good time
14:50 - oops and you make sure we apply that to
14:55 - both and then
15:03 - let's just get all of them just to be
15:06 - sure I'm not gonna test it out to see if
15:10 - this is necessary it's just so quick to
15:13 - to type this out all right so let's go
15:19 - through our little flow here we're gonna
15:21 - take our Styles move it into our
15:26 - template we're gonna save that and then
15:33 - we're going to take all of this and move
15:34 - it over here now you'll see this looks a
15:37 - little bit different I wanted to show
15:38 - you all the newer version I think they
15:40 - call it the lightning experience so this
15:42 - with the newer version looks like and
15:44 - also if you remember yesterday I was
15:45 - super frustrated by how tiny this this
15:48 - window was here with the with the code
15:51 - so I went in dev tools and made it a lot
15:54 - bigger I'm thinking about using
15:57 - tampermonkey to write a script to just
15:59 - change this but I don't know if it's
16:02 - worth it it depends on how much I'm
16:04 - going to be working with this if I'm
16:06 - going to work with it a lot then it's
16:07 - going to annoy me so maybe I will wear a
16:09 - script but for now since I'm just copy
16:12 - and pasting in there it doesn't really
16:14 - matter
16:15 - it'd be worse if I to edit it directly
16:20 - okay let's check this out okay okay so
16:28 - that's working out like we wanted two
16:33 - buttons here the yellow I don't know how
16:38 - I feel about that yellow
16:47 - yeah I'm not sure I think I might change
16:51 - it I think I'm gonna leave it for now
16:55 - just kind of get used to it and then
16:58 - maybe come back to it later on so let's
17:01 - make a note let's see can you do inline
17:12 - notes now you can't well at least let's
17:18 - see if you could do this I don't think
17:20 - you know what I think you can do it in
17:22 - SAS but not in regular CSS
17:24 - I don't really know it doesn't matter
17:27 - I'll put it right here
17:48 - okay
17:51 - all right I'm just gonna look quickly oh
17:55 - that actually changed that as well
17:58 - that's interesting so I guess this is an
18:04 - a tag and this is not actually I don't
18:09 - really hate these being two different
18:10 - colors I'm but I'm gonna revisit those
18:15 - again
18:15 - I really don't want to mess with the
18:17 - colors too much well I have a different
18:19 - font because the font the the type of
18:22 - font and then especially the font weight
18:24 - plays such a huge role in how things
18:26 - look a color might be fine and with one
18:29 - font and with another font it'll make it
18:32 - unreadable so let's get the right font
18:36 - in here now I keep saying we need to
18:38 - change the font so let's just do it now
18:42 - so I'm gonna go through I could just
18:44 - copy the font from a other project but I
18:46 - think it might be a good idea to go
18:48 - through how to grab a font so we're
18:51 - gonna get a Google font let's see so I
19:02 - just typed in Roboto Google font am I
19:05 - good at google fonts okay now there is a
19:09 - home page the google fonts where you can
19:11 - browse different fonts and pick what you
19:13 - want so you can go to that if you're not
19:16 - sure what you want but since we knew
19:18 - exactly what font we wanted we're just
19:19 - going to go right to it so you can see a
19:21 - lot of information about the font but
19:25 - what we want to do is select it so we're
19:27 - going to go up here and select this font
19:28 - and then we have this little you know
19:32 - drawer down here and it'll give us
19:35 - several options for how to embed this
19:40 - font we can also customize the font so
19:43 - we can see we can grab what we want so
19:47 - right now we're just bringing in the
19:48 - regular 400 font weight but I want to
19:53 - bring in light medium bold
20:00 - and I'm not sure if we're using italic
20:03 - anywhere
20:06 - yeah I'm not I'm not sure I'm not gonna
20:10 - bring in any italic now if we find
20:13 - somewhere where we see us our text will
20:16 - bring this in but for now this is good
20:20 - if we end up not using one of these font
20:22 - weights we can always redo it later
20:26 - because this is a lot to load it gives
20:29 - you a low time estimate of moderate we'd
20:31 - rather get it to be fast so I'm thinking
20:36 - we actually might not need the medium at
20:40 - some point but we'll see for now I'd
20:45 - rather have it so that I could see what
20:47 - they look like you can also pick
20:50 - languages so we're gonna stick just with
20:53 - Latin I'm I don't sorry I don't mean
20:56 - languages in the sense of a I know it
21:00 - says languages but these are really more
21:01 - characters I'm not sure why they have
21:05 - languages as the title there okay so we
21:08 - can do it two different ways we can do
21:09 - the standard way or we could use the
21:12 - import and I'm not sure what would be
21:21 - the best
21:29 - hmm I don't know I think I'm gonna try
21:34 - to do the standard way since we have
21:39 - access if if I only had access to a
21:41 - stylesheet it's nice that you can import
21:43 - it as well but let's put this in right
21:52 - above our style I'm gonna bring this in
21:57 - and see you can see it it tells us all
22:01 - our font sizes here and now we'll just
22:06 - copy this and before I paste this into
22:13 - our our style sheet
22:16 - let's see where they're bringing in
22:20 - their font if they're putting it on the
22:22 - body tag or down lower let's see okay
22:30 - they are oh they're bringing it on the
22:32 - HTML tag okay that's interesting I think
22:38 - will bring ours in on the body tag there
22:40 - should not be anything that displays
22:42 - outside of the body and that's true so
22:47 - I'm gonna put it on the body tag
22:56 - and I'm gonna do this like this so HTML
23:01 - body that way I'm positive that at least
23:06 - at this level my font family is more
23:09 - specific than theirs so it should
23:13 - override theirs we may find some cases
23:16 - where they've added a font family you
23:19 - know down lower or something more
23:20 - specific but we'll we'll figure that out
23:24 - when we get to it
23:26 - so with these I want to test this out
23:41 - and let's keep forgetting where I have
23:47 - these windows
23:56 - actually you know what I really want to
23:58 - do whoa
23:59 - Oh interesting so it's giving me an
24:08 - error for my link tag interesting let's
24:15 - see if I couldn't just do this okay so
24:23 - it would not let me put this link tag in
24:26 - without terminating the tag which is
24:30 - fine um obviously we've been doing react
24:33 - for so long we're used to doing that so
24:37 - normally I would but since we just copy
24:38 - and paste it in I didn't even notice
24:40 - okay
24:42 - anyway I was going to say if I end up
24:43 - using tampermonkey to put a script in I
24:47 - think I'm gonna put in a button that can
24:50 - just make this fullscreen because I
24:54 - don't need any of this stuff around the
24:55 - edges it's just taking up a lot of space
24:58 - and I'll never need to select anything
25:01 - so that might be useful to have a nice
25:04 - you know fullscreen I don't know what
25:06 - these buttons do maybe there is a full
25:07 - screen you know that's a search this is
25:11 - like oh okay there is an undo redo
25:15 - increase font size decrease this is the
25:18 - most bare-bones editor of I've seen at
25:21 - least it tells you the positions it's
25:23 - probably hard to see that fonts are
25:25 - really small but it does tell you your
25:27 - the line numbers so not bad but very
25:30 - basic ok let's see what this is
25:40 - nice let's verify that we are getting
25:46 - the correct font so we're just going to
25:49 - click on a font here and we'll go to
25:51 - computed and see computed is usually the
25:54 - easiest way to find something specific
25:58 - yep it's the right font
26:00 - let's try one other place just to be
26:02 - sure it all looks right but yep there we
26:06 - go
26:07 - okay wonderful great alright so with the
26:15 - exception of a few things that we're
26:17 - going to think about and maybe come back
26:19 - to later on this is not bad
26:24 - we may change this add some things I
26:29 - don't know but I don't want to make any
26:31 - serious design changes until I get some
26:34 - input from other people at the
26:36 - University here because it's honestly
26:40 - going to be a waste of effort if other
26:42 - people have strong opinions and more
26:44 - authority than they permit it to how to
26:47 - do something right now
26:48 - okay let's see alright I got about four
26:54 - minutes left and then I'll do question
26:56 - answer so if you've been asking
26:57 - questions just hang on for four minutes
26:59 - and then I'll get to them okay now let's
27:03 - check this sign up view and make sure
27:08 - that it looks right if everything's
27:09 - right with that then we're actually
27:10 - going to sign in if you remember
27:12 - yesterday we tried to sign in and it
27:14 - looked a mess so we're gonna have some
27:17 - work to do so let's sign okay
27:26 - interesting interesting
27:34 - maybe there's an inactive class I'll
27:40 - have to check that out as to why these
27:42 - colors are changing but this looks fine
27:46 - it looks like all our styles are being
27:48 - applied oh that's a problem I don't know
27:50 - if you notice that when we need to let's
27:55 - see what it does here
27:56 - all right this spacing is fine but we
27:58 - need to add some more space between this
28:02 - and this
28:02 - so before with the other font it was it
28:05 - wasn't overlapping but now you can see
28:08 - it's actually overlapping that T and the
28:10 - GR overlap so that's not good this kind
28:16 - of thing I don't want to make myself
28:18 - sound like I'm an expert or anything but
28:20 - I really think that when it comes to CSS
28:23 - stuff attention to small details like
28:25 - that are the difference between a really
28:28 - good site in an okay site it's not the
28:34 - type of thing that every user is going
28:35 - to notice but if a user does notice it
28:38 - it's gonna drop their confidence in your
28:41 - brand or your company or anything at
28:42 - least it definitely does for me if I
28:44 - notice little things like that I think
28:45 - if this company doesn't pay attention to
28:49 - these little details on their own sites
28:52 - are they gonna pay attention to the
28:54 - little details when dealing with me with
28:56 - whatever product or service that they're
28:57 - offering so I've I've actually just
29:00 - refused to look at anything else on a
29:03 - company's web page because I noticed
29:05 - little things like that or even bigger
29:07 - problems and I think I basically just in
29:10 - my head think if they don't care enough
29:13 - about me as a user to fix these things
29:15 - then that's not really the people that I
29:18 - want to work with so at least to me it's
29:23 - a big deal maybe it's just because I do
29:25 - this and I notice those things but I
29:27 - mean if you went to a building right and
29:29 - the steps were all cracked and it was
29:33 - hard to get in and it was kind of you
29:35 - know dirty he it would be leave a bad
29:39 - impression right it's the same thing
29:41 - with a website you come to companies web
29:43 - site and things aren't quite right it
29:46 - makes an impact on people alright so and
29:53 - enough of my my speech on CSS let's fix
30:00 - this okay so our h1 let's grab this
30:06 - class and application and title let's
30:14 - let's put this down in the card Styles
30:16 - section since we're inside the card
30:20 - so in our card style section this this
30:23 - is about the entire card the wrapper so
30:26 - it makes sense that the title would be
30:28 - underneath that so I'm trying to give
30:30 - some structure to the CSS I'm not
30:32 - following a specific methodology but
30:37 - better to get do try to do something
30:40 - then just have a mess of things which if
30:43 - you've all watched the streams for
30:45 - previous projects you know I have a
30:47 - tendency to make a mess of the CSS if
30:49 - I'm not careful okay so let's just
30:56 - change this bottom margin a bit
31:06 - margin-bottom and let's go with I know
31:12 - they're doing EMS but I'm just way more
31:14 - comfortable with pixels I can usually
31:17 - tell how many pixels I need just by
31:19 - looking at a thing and I can't with with
31:22 - other units it's got a 24 because what
31:27 - we really want oh yeah that's that's
31:29 - much better let's zoom out of it yeah
31:32 - perfect I like that
31:35 - okay so let's grab this and paste it
31:39 - over great okay I'm not gonna bother
31:44 - testing this right now
31:45 - it's pretty basic it should work and my
31:50 - timer is just ran out so let's take our
31:55 - five minutes do some question and answer
32:00 - let me scroll up to the top and I'm
32:03 - gonna work my way down and get to as
32:04 - many questions and comments as I can if
32:06 - I don't get to your question during this
32:08 - session after our next 25 minute session
32:11 - of coding then I'll get to all the
32:14 - questions so red asks is it possible to
32:21 - learn Python on free code camp so as far
32:25 - as I know free code camp there there
32:28 - exercises or challenges whatever they
32:31 - call them it does not deal with Python
32:37 - but potentially free code camp is more
32:40 - than just those lessons so you have the
32:42 - YouTube videos you have the forum you
32:47 - now have the guide which deals with a
32:49 - lot of different topics so there may be
32:51 - other free code camp resources that
32:53 - could help you learn Python but in terms
32:54 - of the specific challenges that are on
32:57 - the main free code camp site I don't
32:59 - believe there's any Python in there they
33:02 - are working on a new curriculum as far
33:04 - as I know there's no Python in that
33:06 - either I could be mistaken so if anybody
33:09 - I know some of you that watch this are
33:10 - also working on helping with other
33:13 - things in free code camp so if I'm wrong
33:15 - about that let me know but I tell you
33:19 - where is a decent place
33:20 - for me to pick up the little bit of
33:22 - Python knowledge that I know is Udacity
33:24 - is intro to computer science course uses
33:27 - Python so if you also would like to get
33:32 - some background in computer science and
33:35 - learn Python at the same time that's
33:37 - probably your best route if you are
33:40 - already really confident in all these
33:42 - computer science concepts and you just
33:44 - need to learn Python syntax quickly then
33:48 - that might not be the best for you you
33:51 - might want to try out code academies and
33:54 - browser exercises I believe they have
33:57 - Python I'm not 100% sure it's been a
33:59 - while since I was on their site but
34:00 - those would be my top suggestions
34:04 - hopefully that helps
34:08 - okay harsh it says I have a question
34:11 - what is the benefit of using Salesforce
34:17 - let's see you may have used Google forum
34:23 - for submissions yeah so the benefit with
34:27 - Salesforce is really in I don't know how
34:33 - much I don't want to show you too much
34:34 - in the Salesforce because we have
34:36 - student data that you're not supposed to
34:39 - show anyone so I don't want to
34:41 - accidentally show that on YouTube
34:43 - because the university could get in a
34:45 - lot of trouble for that and so could I
34:46 - so I'm just gonna try to describe a
34:49 - little bit about the other things that
34:51 - Salesforce does this is probably I'm
34:53 - sure you could check it out on their
34:54 - website but basically the ability to
35:01 - track and run reports on all the data
35:04 - easily from a pretty simple user
35:07 - interface is one of the strengths of
35:09 - Salesforce there are a lot of other
35:14 - additional things Salesforce can do with
35:17 - that data like sending emails
35:20 - automatically depending on what stage of
35:22 - the journey they're in
35:24 - you can get sales horses like you pay
35:27 - for the base product and then you pay
35:29 - for these add-ons so depending on what
35:30 - add-ons you get it can do other things
35:32 - were maybe going to get an add-on soon I
35:35 - hope we do where we could define routes
35:37 - a basically a decision tree for new
35:40 - students or donors or whoever depending
35:44 - on what actions they take they go
35:46 - through entirely different route of
35:48 - automated emails and mailings and phone
35:51 - calls and different things that could
35:53 - happen so that we can really customize
35:55 - the experience for each prospective
35:57 - student so that they get the materials
36:00 - that are of most interest to them based
36:02 - on you know where they're at what major
36:07 - they're interested in what sport they're
36:09 - interested in playing so I think it'll
36:11 - be a nice it will help to automate a lot
36:14 - of the work that we are having people do
36:16 - right now that they probably there's no
36:17 - need for them to do manually so that'll
36:20 - be nice to free up some time for other
36:21 - people but then it'll also be really
36:23 - nice for the prospective students as
36:24 - well so that they don't get a lot of
36:26 - material that's irrelevant to them and
36:28 - kind of a waste of their time to go
36:30 - through so that's kind of the cool thing
36:33 - that to me that I've seen that
36:36 - Salesforce does there's so much more the
36:39 - Salesforce does that I have never seen
36:41 - or used so I don't want to limit it to
36:44 - that there's also some machine learning
36:47 - things that they're building in now that
36:50 - I haven't used so it can do so much more
36:54 - in this use case it's basically online
36:57 - form right we could do this ourselves
36:59 - and it would be easier honestly to build
37:02 - out the form in just plain HTML CSS set
37:07 - it to a Google sheet and be done with it
37:09 - but we wouldn't have access to all those
37:11 - other things and it wouldn't tie into
37:14 - other systems that we have on campus so
37:16 - anyway hopefully that explains it a bit
37:19 - I am by far not a Salesforce expert so
37:24 - I'm sure I'm not doing it justice in
37:26 - terms of what it can do okay let me go
37:58 - I was just checking now I don't think I
38:01 - was hoping I'd get down to the bottom of
38:03 - the chat but there's too much there now
38:08 - so I'm just going to mark down where I
38:09 - left off and we'll get back to it after
38:12 - our 25 minute code session
38:23 - okay
38:27 - all right
38:31 - so what was next all right we fix this
38:37 - now we're gonna login
38:51 - I thought did we log in yesterday why am
38:55 - i logged out of I'm gonna grab the grab
39:02 - what I need on this other screen
39:24 - evidently I have several accounts for
39:27 - this now that I'm checking in my my last
39:30 - buzz okay
39:44 - all right I should work
39:51 - whoa wait wait wait hold on yeah you all
39:58 - saw this yesterday right it did not look
40:04 - like this yesterday it this is what did
40:14 - we click on yesterday that looked so
40:17 - crazy
40:29 - all right we need to check this out
40:49 - okay this is our video from yesterday
40:53 - this is what it looked like yesterday
40:56 - and then now it looks like this I'm
41:01 - happy that it looks like that but I
41:05 - don't know well hopefully at some point
41:07 - we'll get this screen again and can see
41:09 - what the problem is all right wow that's
41:17 - pretty crazy okay
41:19 - well I'm happy about this so the styles
41:22 - that we've applied here and to the
41:25 - button are still working as well as our
41:28 - font so that's good news this might take
41:31 - less time than I anticipated so let's go
41:39 - ahead and start the online app
41:49 - why
41:50 - [Music]
41:52 - why do they make me click that and then
41:54 - click another button alright that's not
41:56 - really something I can change I don't
41:59 - think that was a good user experience
42:02 - decision though all right let me see I'm
42:06 - just kind of checking the font size is a
42:08 - little small for me that looks like
42:10 - twelve or fourteen yeah it's fourteen
42:20 - let's make that bigger where are we
42:23 - getting that fourteen from I like to set
42:31 - my minimum font size at sixteen pixels
42:39 - so how is this
42:47 - Christian's contain
42:49 - [Music]
42:57 - Wow this one is at 12 point font yeah we
43:02 - definitely need to make these bigger
43:03 - these should both be at least 16 let's
43:08 - see if we can see if we put it on here
43:14 - on this element if we can get it to
43:15 - affect the elements below it I don't
43:18 - think so but it's worth a shot
43:29 - whoops it's 16 no but can we get
43:50 - here we go
43:59 - no I don't want that now it affected
44:02 - this font size as well all right I was
44:04 - just trying to get around being really
44:05 - specific with these classes but I think
44:07 - we're gonna have to so let's go to this
44:14 - one
44:22 - I guess we could use not
44:33 - yeah let's just do that let's try to use
44:36 - and knots and knots will that work
44:49 - yeah that worked awesome
44:53 - I like that okay let me copy and paste
44:56 - this and then explain what I did in case
44:58 - you're not familiar with this selector
45:03 - we're gonna put this under
45:12 - let's go with loops do not mean to hit
45:18 - that
45:27 - let me make this a bit bigger I'm sorry
45:30 - I should have made this bigger earlier
45:33 - okay okay so here's what I did
45:39 - hopefully you can see this you know what
45:43 - I want to let me reset these settings is
45:45 - I don't want this to get cut off by my
45:47 - face so I need to set this so that we
45:51 - can scroll past the bottom core settings
46:13 - scroll past end okay that's a good
46:16 - setting I I like to have this setting on
46:18 - all the time I don't know how it got
46:19 - turned off at scroll past end and Adam
46:22 - lets us do this which can be useful if
46:25 - you don't want to have things right at
46:28 - the bottom of your screen so right now
46:30 - here's what we're doing we've selected
46:32 - that target X application percentage
46:35 - container which was our full container
46:37 - and then instead of having to go through
46:40 - each one of these spans and select the
46:44 - the class because we didn't want it to
46:47 - apply to one of the spans so instead of
46:50 - having to select each one of these
46:52 - separately we just added a knot and then
46:57 - put the class that we didn't want to
47:00 - have in there
47:02 - so this is so much more concise so
47:12 - that's that's what we've done there in
47:16 - situations like that it's it's really
47:20 - nice and it saves some code alright it's
47:24 - ok I'm ok with this the only thing I
47:28 - might change I'm not worried about right
47:30 - now is this red I don't understand why
47:33 - they're going with red for that that
47:35 - usually indicates that something's wrong
47:37 - like an error so maybe it will change
47:43 - that and see I'm just really interested
47:48 - in seeing what it looks like when we
47:49 - start so let's move on to that
47:56 - okay not bad let's ensure that our
47:59 - Styles okay so our button styles are not
48:04 - applying whenever this disabled class is
48:07 - there let's see what happens when we
48:09 - apply okay great now our styles do take
48:16 - effect so that's okay let's make sure
48:20 - that our card styles are there it looks
48:22 - like it but it can't hurt to
48:25 - double-check target ex-con interesting
48:38 - no they didn't apply okay but we do have
48:44 - a nice class too to latch on to here so
48:49 - we have this target X card so let's grab
48:54 - that and we should be able to just add
48:56 - this to our card styles and we already
48:58 - have so here's our card Styles it's
49:04 - interesting on that first page they
49:06 - don't use this card class on what is
49:10 - essentially a card so that's a little
49:13 - bit odd okay but that should take care
49:16 - of this card also I want to fix the same
49:21 - thing that we had going on before with
49:23 - the spacing let's see Target X
49:25 - application form title let's make sure
49:27 - okay great we should be fine
49:30 - we just never pasted those styles over
49:33 - so I'm not worried about that
49:35 - let's see dab this blue color is on
49:38 - these dropdowns so we may change that
49:42 - and they are actually really small all
49:50 - right I'm not going to change it right
49:51 - now right now going through I'm trying
49:53 - to differentiate between things that if
49:56 - I have time I would like to do and
49:59 - things that really should be done so
50:01 - this category here of things are things
50:03 - that I think aren't necessary to do so
50:07 - we're gonna hold off on these what we
50:09 - would do is change the color and the
50:11 - size and positioning of these a bit so
50:13 - that they're in here more but I'd rather
50:18 - kind of go through everything and look
50:19 - for major issues alright so let's start
50:25 - now the problem with this application is
50:28 - going to be that there are things that I
50:31 - won't see depending on what choices I
50:34 - make hopefully there's nothing like
50:37 - really different that I should be seeing
50:40 - it should just be what questions I get
50:43 - shown or not oh all right so this is see
50:49 - that this is a good illustration of the
50:51 - difference
50:51 - like this obviously is something that
50:53 - needs change this is ridiculous
50:56 - oh well interesting on this page these
51:00 - arrows are much more reasonable in terms
51:02 - of size
51:03 - I wouldn't say errors what do they call
51:05 - these Chevron's okay all right so the
51:10 - only problems I see here right now are
51:13 - the logo is way too small this button
51:16 - needs styling and the text is way too
51:20 - small in a lot of places here you know
51:25 - down here inside this select this button
51:30 - these styles oh do you see this we're
51:33 - definitely going to take away that I'm
51:36 - not a fan of this here yeah all right so
51:44 - we're gonna take away that animation
51:50 - let's see what happens
51:56 - hmm that's a cool effect we'll want to
52:01 - change the colors here of this sidebar
52:03 - I think the font size should be larger
52:08 - here I'm thinking more of on a phone it
52:13 - that click the tap targets need to be I
52:17 - would say at least 40 pixels tall and
52:25 - that's there's no that's nowhere near 40
52:29 - interesting this is going to need some
52:34 - work on mobile I'm actually really
52:37 - surprised that it looks like this one on
52:41 - a mobile device I'm gonna have to I'm
52:43 - not gonna do it on the stream since you
52:45 - won't be able to see unless I get my
52:47 - phone in but I'm not a fan of this I'm
52:51 - surprised this should be centered maybe
52:56 - it is centered in terms of the entire
52:58 - width but they're not taking to account
52:59 - this little sidebar and they should so
53:02 - it should be centered it should exclude
53:05 - this width and then be centered here
53:10 - yeah so that definitely needs some work
53:15 - there's no reason why we can't show the
53:17 - logo as well I mean I'm all for a really
53:21 - slim navbar on mobile because there's
53:23 - not a lot of screen space but I think we
53:26 - could stand to be a little bit taller
53:28 - here and keep the logo otherwise there's
53:34 - there's no branding at all for the
53:35 - University okay let's see how much time
53:40 - I have nine minutes all right
53:48 - that would be a good time to make some
53:50 - some notes about this because I just
53:57 - noticed a lot of things I'm definitely
53:59 - going to forget I'm after the
54:00 - question-and-answer session so let's
54:01 - grab a Trello board and make these
54:07 - issues I mean normally well I wouldn't
54:10 - say normally I was trying to test out
54:14 - doing a github project instead of a
54:16 - Trello board but I'm not even really
54:18 - putting this on github right now so and
54:21 - I don't know if I ever will so let's
54:24 - just go with the Trello board
54:31 - I forgot on Chrome Canary and I don't
54:35 - have any much stuff save
54:53 - alright I'm gonna make a new one and
54:58 - potato
55:10 - this first application and I'm just
55:15 - gonna go with the blue for now okay I'm
55:29 - not gonna do all my Kanban rows here
55:33 - right now because I just want to get
55:35 - these ideas out of my head and onto
55:38 - something before I forget as fast as I
55:40 - can
55:41 - okay so let's say
55:44 - [Music]
56:02 - vacation and I'm gonna give these
56:05 - estimates pompadour estimates while I'm
56:07 - doing these I probably wouldn't need a
56:11 - whole Pomodoro cycle to fix that but
56:14 - it's easier to type 1 than 0.5 let's see
56:41 - okay so the first three in case you
56:43 - can't read these it's a fix button
56:45 - colors in the in the nav here change the
56:48 - side nav colors increase font size and
56:51 - and items on the side nav change icon
56:58 - colors and we're going to make all fonts
57:15 - at least 16 pixels and let's let me
57:26 - check this up because I think what's
57:28 - happening is they're using gray instead
57:32 - of black with opacity so let's double
57:36 - check this I didn't give me what I
57:41 - wanted
57:47 - oh there
58:01 - yeah see is this it so they're Gray's
58:05 - are actual grace we don't want that we
58:08 - want Gray's that are black with opacity
58:16 - set and I can't find whether where they
58:20 - have this label there it is let's see
58:31 - okay yeah see that's great let me change
58:35 - this right now just to show you what it
58:36 - different so I'm looking I'm a zoom in
58:41 - here on this name where it's his name
58:43 - right here and let me change this so
58:50 - let's bring this up and let's pick up
58:52 - let's just pick a black so we're gonna
58:58 - do black first and then actually let me
59:04 - switch
59:09 - No there we go
59:15 - let's go 54 okay this is going to be
59:27 - hard to tell because we we don't have it
59:30 - side by side but basically hopefully
59:32 - you're able to see and you can go back
59:34 - and rewind the video and see it's so
59:37 - much easier to read text that's black
59:41 - with opacity with I'm sorry transparency
59:46 - yeah you could say either way
59:48 - transparency or opacity but basically
59:51 - it's 54% is the standard that I do when
59:56 - I want to do input fields 87% is the
59:59 - standard color for all other text but
60:02 - it's so much easier to read when you do
60:04 - that as opposed to using a very similar
60:07 - color but using the hex code for gray in
60:10 - this case it was cccccc yeah I think
60:14 - that was right so anyway that's just a
60:17 - good tip that's actually in the material
60:20 - design guidelines so I didn't make that
60:22 - up myself or discover it myself but
60:26 - anyway that's a good tip so let's just
60:30 - say in our Trello board
60:50 - okay all right
60:53 - what else did I see
61:07 - we remove that hover effect for these
61:09 - buttons scroll down so required field
61:17 - shows up as red I'm gonna have to think
61:23 - about that that seems a little extreme I
61:26 - have a show up that red let's see Center
61:41 - courts on mobile let's see okay okay
61:53 - not bad so far let me check my timer
61:55 - alright I got a minute left so we're
61:57 - gonna stop there we got a little bit
62:00 - here down there so not not too bad all
62:04 - the the big things are there Oh actually
62:06 - I want to change the colors on these
62:09 - indicators
62:18 - there we go all right I'm just gonna
62:22 - start with the question answer session a
62:24 - little bit early since I don't there's
62:26 - not that much I'd get done in another
62:28 - minute so let me scroll up to where I
62:31 - left off so at this point in the stream
62:34 - I'm finished for the most part with the
62:37 - coding portion so if you're not
62:39 - interested in the question answer
62:40 - session and that would be the time when
62:43 - you might want to take off otherwise
62:46 - please stick around and help answer
62:48 - questions or ask some questions of your
62:50 - own okay
63:12 - and see
63:15 - the heart rook said please add some
63:17 - space between username and sign-in when
63:19 - you click it yes that was exactly what I
63:28 - was thinking so good call on that sorry
63:30 - I didn't look over and see that sooner
63:37 - okay
63:38 - Harshad has some good advice here
63:40 - Harshad says he found an online wire
63:43 - framing software called Sigma fi GMA
63:46 - which is as good as sketch and it is
63:49 - free so check that out
63:52 - I just heard of it so I can't recommend
63:54 - it but check that out figma comm fi GMA
63:59 - calm thanks for the say the suggestion
64:04 - Harshit
64:27 - John Hanson says with Google Fonts is it
64:30 - ever worth it to actually put their CSS
64:32 - into your code or best to leave as a
64:35 - relative link
64:36 - Harshit says I guess for Roboto it's
64:38 - good to use the the link because it's
64:41 - usually cached it's quite a popular font
64:43 - yeah I agree
64:46 - and I think that that would harsh it
64:49 - said can apply across the board to
64:50 - different JavaScript libraries and CSS
64:54 - libraries and things if it's very
64:59 - popular you might get better performance
65:04 - in terms of load times by using the the
65:08 - link from a CDN or something like that
65:10 - if what you're using is not as popular
65:13 - then you might get better performance by
65:17 - having it you know within your code base
65:20 - so it's a good idea when you come to the
65:23 - testing phase for you know
65:25 - site speed to try it either way then and
65:29 - see what kind of results you get
65:49 - it looks like those sign up and login
65:52 - links that we were seeing on the first
65:54 - page that for me were two different
65:56 - colors were not two different colors for
66:01 - some of you so maybe I thought we'd
66:07 - changed it for visited as well right
66:09 - didn't we do that yeah maybe
66:15 - active there's got to be some sort of
66:19 - active or inactive class that's going on
66:21 - or off to check that out more closely
66:23 - later on
66:24 - that'll up probably fall under the
66:26 - category of little things that don't
66:28 - absolutely need done but if we have time
66:30 - we'll do it
66:44 - okay rook says the courses from Rice
66:47 - University on Coursera are also good for
66:50 - Python they're free to audit so awesome
66:55 - thanks for for pointing that out rook
66:58 - there's a lot of free courses out there
67:00 - it is really good to hear what other
67:03 - people say about the courses because
67:06 - otherwise it's like which one do you
67:08 - pick you know there's so many free
67:10 - courses not just for you know stuff like
67:14 - we do but all different fields
67:34 - world's asked do you see things like
67:36 - Salesforce take away possible dev jobs
67:39 - in the future I I don't know that I know
67:46 - enough about this to give a good answer
67:47 - but based on what I do know here's what
67:50 - I think the something like Salesforce
67:59 - would help to cut down on a lot of
68:01 - manual work that's done but not
68:04 - necessarily by developers I'm talking
68:06 - about data entry work manually filing
68:10 - things manually making spreadsheets and
68:14 - copying things over so in that sense I
68:18 - don't think those are necessarily things
68:20 - that devs would be doing and for
68:23 - Salesforce if you want to do custom
68:26 - things then you sometimes need a dev so
68:29 - I can see it going another way and
68:32 - there's now this whole niche of
68:35 - Salesforce devs that can develop you
68:38 - know add ons to Salesforce or change the
68:41 - look right now with the level of
68:44 - permissions that I have in Salesforce I
68:46 - actually have higher permissions than
68:49 - most other people from the University
68:51 - because I need to access some some of
68:54 - the code but I don't have permissions to
68:56 - change everything but if I did I could
68:58 - change the look of the the whole UI for
69:02 - the the admin panel in Salesforce you
69:04 - can change quite a bit so I imagine
69:06 - there are dev opportunities because of
69:09 - Salesforce where there weren't
69:10 - opportunities before now certainly are
69:13 - there going to be opportunities as many
69:15 - opportunities for devs to build
69:16 - something like this from scratch you
69:18 - know proprietary systems for different
69:21 - institutions no but I don't know that
69:23 - that was a that'd be a good situation
69:26 - anyway I that would be kind of a mess I
69:30 - think to have to go in in every
69:33 - different place has their own custom
69:35 - built system I don't know so I guess my
69:41 - short answer is I'm of the opinion that
69:43 - this would not take away depth
69:46 - it might just shift dev jobs
69:53 - Harshit says did your famous IT
69:56 - department finished the single sign-on
69:58 - yes they did actually let me let me show
70:01 - you what this single sign-on looks like
70:04 - I don't think I showed you this I did
70:07 - work on some of the styles it didn't
70:08 - turn out exactly like I would like I
70:11 - wanted it to but it was a weird workflow
70:14 - where I couldn't edit any Styles
70:16 - directly I had to send them to the head
70:19 - of the IT department and then she
70:20 - forward them on to another company and
70:22 - then somebody at that company had to
70:25 - actually put the styles in we had a lot
70:27 - of trouble going back and forth where
70:29 - the code that I gave them didn't get
70:31 - inputted into the right place or
70:33 - properly and so finally I just tried to
70:36 - make as complete of style sheets as I
70:40 - could and then send them and say exactly
70:42 - where to put them and then for the most
70:45 - part it worked out but there's still a
70:46 - lot of would change but the the feedback
70:50 - loop was just so slow like we're talking
70:52 - like weeks before I could see what the
70:55 - changes were so I did what I could do
70:58 - you know considering all the other
71:00 - projects that I had going on so you all
71:05 - could go to the login screen if you
71:07 - wanted to it's access FUS dot franciscan
71:11 - ddu you won't be able to get past the
71:13 - login screen though so let me show you I
71:17 - actually can log in as a student or as a
71:19 - staff member Oh Logan as a staff member
71:21 - I think there's more to see there so
71:24 - basically the background image wasn't my
71:26 - decision that was already there when I
71:28 - started working on it I don't know that
71:30 - I would have put a background image
71:31 - there but there were so many other
71:33 - issues that I just left that alone there
71:37 - is one cool thing that you can see here
71:40 - in the image that's kind of weird I
71:42 - don't know how many people noticed this
71:43 - but it was a like a long exposure photo
71:46 - so some students were walking here and
71:49 - you can see a couple things one you can
71:52 - see a shadow on the wall but you can
71:55 - also see this faint outline of so
71:59 - a student's shoe in their leg so it
72:01 - looks like there's a ghost there
72:02 - so anyway cool little easter egg that I
72:06 - don't know how many people will notice
72:07 - but anyway you can see I added the
72:10 - proper card style shadows border-radius
72:12 - the right effect for the button changed
72:15 - the font to Roboto another thing that's
72:18 - really weird is this look at that that's
72:21 - an image I have no idea why they
72:24 - couldn't just put in text I'm pretty
72:26 - sure that's an image inside of an H tag
72:28 - that's another one of those things that
72:31 - I recommend it to them to change and it
72:34 - didn't get done so I just left it alone
72:36 - they are using the older logo on on this
72:40 - screen which is fine I think it works
72:41 - better in this situation once we log in
72:44 - we'll see the newer logo so we have the
72:51 - new logo here we have the the newer
72:53 - styles for the header I would have liked
72:58 - to have done more with a search but like
73:02 - I said there are a lot of other problems
73:04 - this black line was added after I
73:06 - already submitted all my Styles I would
73:08 - not have this this thick and this color
73:11 - I would make it much thinner and a grey
73:14 - color but maybe you know this will be
73:18 - the next round of changes I'm hoping now
73:21 - that it's completed we'll actually have
73:23 - more access to do some changes on our
73:24 - own but I'm not sure I also made these
73:27 - work cards kind of but they didn't have
73:30 - the right style so now they have the
73:32 - right styles the border radius the
73:33 - shadows a hover effect since they're all
73:35 - clickable I have a hugger cover effect
73:37 - normally I don't recommend a hover
73:39 - effect on a card unless the entire thing
73:42 - is clickable so anyway the university
73:47 - bulletin is on here currently and that's
73:50 - what we've been working on as the
73:53 - project for I think so I'd love to have
73:58 - it integrated into this I think they're
74:00 - using a saml for a single it's the
74:05 - single sign-on so still need to talk
74:08 - more with the IT department to get in
74:11 - there their last suggestion
74:13 - why don't you just make it so that you
74:16 - can only see the bulletin if you click
74:18 - on this link within here I don't think
74:21 - that's the best idea
74:22 - I mean it's I'm not even sure how it
74:24 - would implement that and it would
74:26 - actually be secure but even if I could
74:28 - then that would mean that nobody could
74:30 - actually go directly to the bulletin so
74:32 - any bookmarks of the bulletin wouldn't
74:34 - really work you'd have to come through
74:35 - here so rather not do that so we'll see
74:40 - hopefully you can get it integrated
74:41 - better so anyway this is it you click on
74:44 - it you're automatically logged in so not
74:47 - bad I'm actually I'm really excited that
74:50 - they got this working it's something
74:51 - that they've wanted for a really long
74:53 - time and yeah so I'm happy I'm proud of
74:58 - the IT people for you know getting this
75:01 - together and working so and I'm happy
75:06 - that you know they asked me to work on
75:08 - the Styles too so that was really cool I
75:12 - think well it shows that they know that
75:15 - I'm I'm good at this I guess or good
75:19 - enough that they wanted me to do it and
75:22 - that they care about the look of the
75:23 - sites which i think is awesome
75:25 - so always happy to collaborate with
75:28 - other departments whenever possible and
75:30 - so this was cool
75:32 - and that's cool the head of the IT
75:36 - department is really nice she's a really
75:40 - smart woman and I enjoy working with her
75:42 - so so this was kind of a cool project
75:49 - just a little one but it was nice
75:51 - alright let me go back to the live chat
76:05 - Oh on Anson's has going to the gym for a
76:10 - workout my wife somin is making me go
76:13 - what can I say well I guess you gotta
76:17 - gotta keep your wife happy right that's
76:19 - your marriage means more than then
76:22 - you're coding right keep it in
76:25 - perspective so see you tomorrow it's on
76:29 - okay Blake says thanks for the pool
76:32 - request but now everything is undefined
76:34 - okay so earlier today I submitted a pull
76:36 - request to one of Blake's projects yeah
76:42 - so let me so here's what I was you're
76:56 - getting undefined
76:57 - everything is undefined
77:05 - what are your here's what I would check
77:10 - Blake what are your headers look like on
77:14 - your Google sheets
77:24 - because that's what because if you if
77:26 - you're actually getting information to
77:29 - go to your Google sheet and saying
77:30 - undefined then that means a lot is that
77:34 - is going right so that's a good sign
77:37 - but we need to make sure that one the
77:41 - data getting sent is in the right format
77:43 - which it ought to be
77:46 - you just need serialized data and then
77:50 - we also need to make sure that the
77:53 - headers match up exactly with the names
77:55 - so let me okay let's check this out
78:04 - Blake do you mind if we check this out
78:07 - on on the live stream right now I don't
78:13 - want to check it out if there's any data
78:15 - in there that we I shouldn't show but it
78:18 - would be cool to show everybody a little
78:20 - bit more about how this works so just
78:23 - let me know I'll open it on and on okay
78:25 - cool all right so let's open this up
78:27 - here and let me get rid of this dot and
78:32 - this asterisk okay okay here's this is
78:38 - SSS
78:43 - okay so we have this awesome let's put
78:49 - in another row that that should be
78:51 - helpful another column I mean come on
78:55 - another clone won't you let me put
78:57 - another oh it's view only I'm gonna send
79:06 - a request for edit access if you don't
79:08 - want to give it to me that's fine I'll
79:10 - just tell you what to do here but I'd
79:11 - like to add another column for the time
79:13 - stamp because that can be helpful let me
79:17 - check out the repo as well
79:33 - oops on the wrong wrong repo
80:02 - okay let me see
80:15 - oops dang it
80:30 - okay
80:46 - good timestamp and let's make sure
80:58 - okay it looked like there was a space at
81:02 - the end of named so that potentially
81:04 - could be that could have been the
81:04 - problem with name so let's see so that
81:11 - may work now and let's see
81:25 - that's fine double-check this yeah okay
81:41 - let me show you I think I still have my
81:43 - stuff up
81:51 - okay so this is so this is exactly how I
81:56 - had it set up so I was able to get
81:59 - everything to come through at at one
82:03 - point so it looks like
82:18 - hmm interesting
82:30 - yeah I'm I'm pretty sure the issue with
82:33 - the name was that extra space at the end
82:35 - so that should work now because that was
82:41 - consistently undefined
82:55 - let me check out I mean if you want to
82:56 - test that again maybe it'll work yeah
83:13 - gasps is that a SteelSeries Siberia
83:16 - headset by the way those are really
83:18 - comfortable
83:18 - yes it is that's crazy that you were
83:21 - able to identify the headset from my
83:24 - tiny you know video in the corner
83:28 - they're so cool yeah I actually I really
83:30 - like these
83:31 - SteelSeries headsets I've been using
83:35 - them for and I think at least three
83:40 - years and they're great I get they are
83:45 - really comfortable occasionally my ears
83:48 - will hurt but only if I've been coding
83:49 - like all day and taught it like for like
83:51 - ten hours if I've had them on ten hours
83:53 - plus otherwise it's great audio quality
83:57 - I don't really know I'm not really an
83:59 - audiophile so they sound good to me it
84:05 - would be nice if they had a little bit
84:07 - more bass but it's not it's not a huge
84:10 - deal they're they sound good and it
84:13 - keeps the rest of the noise out from you
84:16 - know other things going on so it keeps
84:18 - me focused over the under fight says you
84:26 - won't be able to get past a login screen
84:28 - though is that a challenge
84:30 - actually yes if anybody can get into
84:35 - this access FUS somehow get to this
84:39 - screen and prove that you got to that
84:43 - screen then I don't know what you'll get
84:47 - you'll definitely get a shout out on the
84:49 - live stream at the very least but that
84:53 - would act that would really be awesome I
84:56 - would I wouldn't call out the IT
84:58 - department but I would like quietly just
85:01 - go to the head of IT and say you might
85:04 - want to check this out so that's how I
85:07 - prefer to handle things I have a lot of
85:08 - respect for the head of the IT
85:10 - department so I don't like to publicly
85:12 - call anyone out on stuff I'd rather give
85:14 - her the chance to you know handle it
85:17 - with her team quietly and I appreciate
85:20 - when when they give that same chance to
85:21 - me if something's wrong on my site so
85:25 - I'm a big believer and like going
85:28 - directly to a person privately when
85:30 - something should be changed instead of
85:32 - calling them out publicly calling
85:34 - someone out publicly in my mind should
85:36 - always be the absolute last resort
85:40 - because you can't ever take that back
85:49 - okay so I just saw one go in here does
85:52 - this mean that it works let me see
85:57 - all right cool thanks it's working yay
86:00 - all right and Blake if you I did change
86:04 - a lot of stuff for the Google the Google
86:10 - Apps Script stuff so if you want me to
86:14 - explain why I change the things I did
86:16 - let me know otherwise I mean if you can
86:18 - check it out and figure out what's going
86:19 - on then you know that's that's good too
86:21 - but I'd be happy to explain a little bit
86:24 - what I did I didn't really change that
86:26 - much at all with with the code that's on
86:31 - the site with the HTML or the JavaScript
86:33 - the the biggest changes were in that
86:37 - Google Apps Script and that's only
86:40 - because I I have used it I don't know
86:43 - maybe a half a dozen times on other
86:44 - sites successfully so I just pulled a
86:46 - lot of that code from my other site
86:48 - since I knew that it was already working
87:03 - okay Blake says and I'm assuming because
87:05 - of the Google script it sends the form
87:07 - to me but it won't send it to test a
87:09 - test comm yes so that area where I put
87:14 - test to test comm so let's check this
87:16 - out let's check out the script editor so
87:21 - if you've never seen this in Google this
87:23 - is really cool so on Google sheets you
87:25 - can have you can run JavaScript right in
87:28 - here this does not handle any es6 or
87:31 - beyond so just be aware of that that's
87:33 - why we're doing this ridiculous stuff
87:35 - here with concatenating all these
87:38 - strings and variables uh-huh instead of
87:41 - using template literals so I actually I
87:44 - I am part of a very large string on the
87:50 - the forums for Google Apps Script asking
87:53 - for es6 support but that's been going on
87:57 - for like two years so I don't know if
88:00 - they'll ever have it or when otherwise
88:03 - this is really cool so you can see when
88:06 - we're sending the emails okay it looks
88:11 - like you already changed that I'm really
88:13 - sorry if you didn't want that email
88:14 - shown on the live buddy I can't do
88:19 - anything about it now so sorry about
88:21 - that but anyway yeah so you can hard
88:23 - code the two email that you want to get
88:26 - so either your email or the email of
88:29 - whoever needs to be checking this at the
88:31 - company that you're building this for
88:32 - and then for this email that the user
88:35 - gets it pulls the email from its you
88:38 - know Eid up for a murdered email so it's
88:41 - just pulling that out from obviously an
88:43 - object and then so that's why there's
88:47 - two different templates because for the
88:49 - user right now we're keeping it simple
88:50 - and just saying you know hey we should
88:52 - receive your submission as a subject
88:54 - thank you of course you can add anything
88:55 - else you want but then for the person
88:57 - that's actually receiving they need the
88:59 - data right they need to know name email
89:01 - phone message so that's why we have two
89:05 - different templates and we're doing two
89:07 - different sends also I don't know how
89:09 - you have this set up if email is not a
89:11 - required field which I recommend it
89:14 - should be
89:16 - but so we don't get an error we have
89:19 - this send in an if statement so it'll
89:22 - only attempt to send it if there is an
89:24 - email otherwise you'll get an error so
89:27 - that's why we wrap this in an if
89:29 - statement but like I said I would
89:31 - recommend making the email first of all
89:34 - validating that it's a valid email and
89:36 - then also making it required so anyway
89:40 - I'm glad I can help with that so I mean
89:42 - i said i'm i'm really happy to help i've
89:45 - done it before so i've gone through
89:52 - quite a bit of oh no no more access how
89:58 - that's cool
89:59 - i've gone through quite a bit of
90:01 - troubleshooting with google sheets and
90:04 - sending form data Google sheets so no
90:09 - sense in you having to go through all
90:10 - that work better to share my information
90:14 - with you and save you a bunch of time
90:18 - okay let me go back through Michael says
90:27 - the background image has ghosts I think
90:29 - I saw Slenderman in there somewhere also
90:32 - yeah it is weird I didn't even notice it
90:35 - somebody in the IT department noticed it
90:37 - and told me and I thought we were gonna
90:41 - try to get a different image in there or
90:43 - Photoshop that out but I guess that
90:46 - didn't happen so I don't think it's a
90:49 - huge deal I think it's kind of a cool
90:50 - little easter egg but I don't know maybe
90:54 - we'll probably switch that image my boss
90:57 - looked at it today and said he wants to
90:59 - switch out the image so it'll probably
91:00 - happen at some point
91:11 - our suits is switching to Kali Linux now
91:14 - I will get through now if you if you
91:19 - don't know what Kali Linux is then
91:20 - you're not a hacker number one but also
91:23 - Kali Linux is Linux that comes preloaded
91:26 - with all these penetration testing tools
91:30 - in there so if if you're white hat
91:34 - therefore penetration testing to use it
91:36 - for good if your black hat then then
91:40 - they're hacking tools that can be used
91:43 - for for evil so if you're interested in
91:49 - that kind of thing check out Kali Linux
91:51 - if you intend on using it for evil
91:54 - though then you didn't hear it from me
91:57 - uh-huh see
92:08 - okay Blake says how do I redirect it to
92:10 - a thank you page okay so you want to
92:13 - thank you page to come up after the
92:15 - after the forum successful form
92:17 - submission yeah you could since you're
92:25 - using javascript to submit the form I
92:28 - actually recommend that you don't
92:29 - redirect to an entirely new page because
92:31 - that would cause a page refresh and
92:32 - that's unnecessary what I think might be
92:36 - better let's bring this up I think I
92:39 - have it on another screen okay so what I
92:48 - think might be better is when you submit
92:52 - the form you have equal either a modal
92:55 - pops up or something in the submit
92:58 - button maybe a little checkmark and it
93:00 - turns green something like that telling
93:02 - people that it was submitted
93:04 - I like that for two reasons one you
93:06 - don't get a page refresh which is nice
93:08 - but also it allows the user then to
93:11 - immediately fill out the form again in
93:13 - case they want to would they really want
93:15 - to I don't know but potentially maybe
93:18 - they they didn't put in the full message
93:22 - or they put in the wrong thing and
93:24 - didn't realize it till they sent it then
93:26 - they won't have to you know do any type
93:29 - of navigation at all they can just redo
93:32 - it so that's my recommendation and if
93:37 - you wanted to do that then
93:47 - what you want to do then is in your
93:51 - contact j/s here where it's this dot
93:55 - done do something that's where you'll
93:58 - want to do you know whatever so like you
94:07 - might want to do so maybe submit form
94:13 - something like this because that's the
94:23 - button right and maybe you could just do
94:26 - like CSS color background color and then
94:39 - do I don't know like green something
94:44 - like that would probably work so check
94:48 - that out if you're interested and want
94:50 - me to submit a pull request for that I
94:52 - can definitely do it I mean I I already
94:55 - have this in here otherwise this is
94:59 - where you'd want to do it and just make
95:03 - sure that the submit button is still
95:06 - active if they want to resubmit that
95:11 - would be that would be my suggestion I
95:14 - usually do modal's that pop up and say
95:18 - hey you know this worked but you don't
95:21 - you don't have to get that complicated
95:23 - with it just something really simple
95:26 - down here a check mark icon anything I
95:30 - think would work
95:57 - okay Blake says thank you you welcome
95:59 - Blake no problem oh cool Arshad says I
96:04 - started learning ethical hacking last
96:05 - month it's good cool yeah I've always
96:12 - wanted to get into stuff like that
96:15 - mainly to do penetration testing on my
96:18 - own sites and make sure that they're
96:21 - secure but I just really have in that
96:26 - time to get into it maybe one day
96:31 - Blake asks do an alert I wouldn't do an
96:39 - alert like not a JavaScript alert so I
96:43 - actually never recommend never doing
96:46 - JavaScript alert on JavaScript alerts on
96:49 - production sites it's so much nicer if
96:53 - you can actually make a modal that will
96:55 - appear because then you have much more
96:56 - control over the Styles cool okay so
97:03 - Blake Blake's gonna do it himself all
97:05 - right that's cool Blake just let me know
97:07 - if you have any trouble with it I think
97:08 - you'll be fine though Harshit says I
97:12 - will try a DDoS and sequel injection
97:15 - okay now officially I did ask you all to
97:19 - try to do this so if if you get in
97:24 - trouble for attempting to hack a
97:27 - university website make sure you tell
97:30 - the authorities that I'm a developer at
97:34 - this university and I asked you to do
97:37 - this test thing I don't want anybody
97:38 - getting in trouble for her for doing
97:41 - that so I'll probably get in trouble at
97:43 - that point but I don't want you all
97:45 - getting in trouble so see I'm doing
97:53 - these
97:55 - oh cool Blake said I'm doing the u.s.
98:00 - I'm trying to read how I would read this
98:03 - CyberPatriot competition this year
98:05 - that's cool I haven't heard of that
98:06 - competition what was it for
98:37 - okay
98:40 - ok so it's a competition for securing
98:43 - networks and computers awesome that
98:45 - sounds really cool you have to let me
98:50 - know when the competition is and how it
98:52 - goes so I'm I'm interested to hear how
98:54 - you do inflate gas how do how do I reset
98:58 - it so how would you reset the form then
99:00 - put it up there we go I think by default
99:07 - it depends on what you want to do if you
99:11 - go with if you go with the modal then
99:16 - you could just have us if you click
99:18 - outside of it it goes away or you can
99:20 - put a closed you know like a little X
99:22 - icon there if you go with something down
99:25 - here you could maybe do it so that when
99:28 - any of these inputs get focused it just
99:32 - resets this that's that's probably how I
99:36 - would do it because if they focus on an
99:38 - input then that means they probably want
99:40 - to want to change what they've done
99:44 - there
100:06 - okay
100:10 - cool rug says I finally made the
100:12 - livestream when it was going score
100:15 - awesome glad you could make the
100:17 - livestream ok Orson says I will not try
100:24 - I don't want to get in trouble yeah I
100:27 - didn't even think about it until just a
100:29 - minute ago like that's probably not a
100:33 - good idea to have everybody try to to
100:37 - hack that site just because I don't I
100:39 - don't know what the laws are in other
100:41 - countries but I've heard that in the
100:46 - United States at least like the laws are
100:49 - pretty strict about attempting to hack
100:51 - even if you don't intend to do any harm
100:53 - like but you could still get you can you
101:01 - still go to jail for that so I mean like
101:04 - I said technically I'm giving you
101:06 - permission but it may not even be it's I
101:10 - probably don't have the authority really
101:11 - to give you permission to do that but if
101:13 - you happen to see anything that would
101:19 - seem like something's off with the
101:21 - security you know let me know and I'll
101:24 - try to check it out yeah I mean I would
101:31 - imagine some of the yeah there's
101:34 - definitely some stuff we wouldn't want
101:35 - people to have access to so anyway I
101:40 - have gotten to the bottom of the live
101:44 - chat so I think I'm going to end the
101:49 - stream now to Thomas yeah pretty decent
101:52 - length of the stream we're coming up on
101:55 - almost two hours here so oh alright I
102:01 - get exhausted after these streams they
102:02 - like I love doing them but it definitely
102:07 - takes a lot of energy okay so thanks
102:13 - everybody for helping and for watching
102:16 - the stream and anyway I'm really glad
102:20 - that I could help you out with your
102:21 - project lake so if anybody
102:23 - everyone's help with your project let me
102:25 - know the best thing would be to send me
102:28 - the github repo because then I can
102:30 - actually see all the code but I'm more
102:33 - than happy to help I don't always have
102:35 - time to do things right away but I'll
102:38 - try to get to it when I can so I should
102:41 - be back tomorrow
102:42 - what's sorry Thursday Wow tomorrow's
102:44 - Friday the week just went by so fast
102:48 - yeah so I'll be back tomorrow probably
102:49 - around the same time 2 p.m. Eastern time
102:52 - and I think we'll be working on on
102:54 - finishing up this the styles for this I
102:58 - think it will take less time than we
103:00 - anticipated or at least that I
103:02 - anticipated so maybe we'll be able to
103:06 - finish this up tomorrow and then then
103:07 - move on to something else so thanks
103:13 - again for watching and until tomorrow
103:16 - have a great day

Cleaned transcript:

everybody welcome to live coding with Jessie today we're going to continue with the styling that we were doing yesterday so I did a little bit of work on it between yesterday stream and now so I'll catch you up with the work that I have done and then we'll keep at it let's see I did want to let you all know in case anybody can make it to the the node member conference that I'm going to be speaking at Nashville at the end of November I don't know if anybody is in that area or is planning on being there but if you are I know when and where I will be speaking so I thought I'd share that with you all you can go on the November site and check it out whenever you want but I just figured I'd I put that on there so I will be on Tuesday it will be Tuesday November 20 I think it's a 28th at 400 p.m. so not bad get this timeslot right before the keynote speaker so I don't know if that's as good or bad but I'll be one of the last speakers all right so let me get I don't have my live chat window open yet let me get that open okay it looks like someone was kneeling so AR wants me to link the site I'm gonna put a link to the site that we're working on and the live chat right now all right so I've changed some some minor details but I think there are important details not everybody who would notice them but it's important for consistency so it's going to be hard to tell without a sidebyside of the old version but what we've done is we've added a different shadow and we've changed the border radius before the border radius was three pixels now it's two pixels that might not seem like a big deal but we use two pixels for everything unless something's changed the last time I checked for material design the standard was a two pixel border radius so we switch that up we have the proper shadows now the shadows were different we have a new button the colors may or may not change I just copied these over from another form that I had done so we have let's see we're gonna have to change that border radius so I was right in the middle getting this button changed whenever I started the stream so let's make sure that that border radius is correct we now have the correct shadow and the correct effect when we hover over it okay we've gone with the allcaps for the text and a slightly thicker for the font the font so all changed to we're going to change the font family and then other than changing the font family changing the color of these it's probably the last thing that we need to do yeah because this this effect is exactly what I want so I'm really glad that this is the default effect that way we don't have to worry about trying to like this okay all right so let's finish up with this button let's change these colors and then we'll try to get the correct font in here so let me see right now what those are no this isn't the right I have a lot of dev tools windows open right now okay so this actually has a three pixel border radius right now as well oh look at that we did we definitely don't want that so that's the bond focus all right good to know I'm glad we that we caught that so let's go over to our CSS so I've since we're adding so much to our CSS I started putting in some some comments just to break it up so all these are for the navbar these are for the cards this is for buttons so hopefully it'll make it easier if we ever have to come back to this or somebody else has to come back and edit this at some point it'll make more sense all right so first of all let's take this good button focus okay that'll get rid of those styles that we saw briefly forgot my period oops and I forgot to check the chat and start my timer so let's get the timers started wherever it is it is okay so let me do 25 minutes of coding and then we'll take a fiveminute break and I'll come to the live chat so if you have a question just hang on for 25 minutes and then I'll get to your question see cool Andrew in the live chat said I'm a big fan so thank you so much that's that's awesome that's actually really cool that my stream has fans anyway I'm glad you're here glad you're in the live chat and unable to join us so I really appreciate you all who are able to join in the live stream I appreciate everyone watching but it's also really cool to have that feedback in the live stream it's definitely a different vibe whenever there's nobody did my camera oh no ok I thought it froze for a second but I was looking at a different preview so we did anyway what I was trying to say was it's a it's just a different feel when there's not that many people in the live chat I I don't know if it's bad I wouldn't say it cause say it's bad but it's just it's very different so I kind of like when there's when there's more activity a hard shot I said you tested the print view and PR 50 in the bulletin I have not tested it yet so I'm gonna test it soon probably I'll get back to that project when I'm done with this but like I think I mentioned yesterday I really just want this to be ready I'm just I'm getting a little bit nervous because no one's been talking about it here I don't know what the due date is I'm just nervous that I missed something or that it's not gonna be ready when it needs to be ready so I'm trying to get ahead of things oh you know what I just saw we don't want this color the underlined so we need to change that as well so we're gonna we've already put in the code you know we didn't we need to put in borderradius two pixels and that should take care of it okay you know let's let's check this let me bring over my dev tools window and let's pull this to the side so we can see what we want to see here and yeah this is definitely the input interesting okay yeah this is what we want so on focus we want to change the color awesome alright so let's grab this and we'll change that color button so let's let's put in input let's let's put in this yellow so I don't know if you remember from probably stream a long time ago probably months ago we had some discussion about the the color this yellow color that's in the palette so this is color I'm talking about and in its original version it's just too light to use on the web it's hard to read so I converted it to this format and was able to darken it just a bit and then that little change made it much easier to read so on a button it's not a big deal but if you I rarely rarely do font like this but on like a thin thick place like this then it it's useful to have it just slightly darker so it's it's it's almost you'd have to have the colors right next to each other to really tell the difference but it's that little bit of Darkness really helps so I kind of like that I think it's the third it was a hue saturation light and I don't remember what the last one is I think that's what it is so anyway I believe it's this third value here that you need to change to darken or lighten an image or I'm sorry a color okay so this is that's right that's what we want now let's grab this and I want to do two things to this actually text occasion so we want to change the color first of all but then we also want to make sure that we have a textdecorationnone no matter what I don't really like the underlined I think the cursorpointer will be fine I'm assuming we have that yeah we do it should be by default on an a tag anyway so let's grab all goodness this is just the default a style all right then lingsu we want to put this I almost want to put the styles that are more Universal you know for a base element like an a tag up at the top so let's put that at the top that I know I didn't copy out yet let's see all right let's see what color I don't want this blue but I do want whoa is that for some reason we just got a refresh it's okay I want to I'm okay with the blue color let's check out what we're currently using here okay here we're using this blue this blue is in the color palette but I'm not really a big fan of it for the web so let's see I'm pretty sure we have links here okay so we are using that yellow for links okay we could try that I'm a little bit hesitant to put the yellow text right next to the yellow button it might be too much so maybe we switch up the button the only reason I really like yellow for a button as it stands out now this isn't really a call to action so mut I'm not that worried about it but for for a button that would be more of a call to action I do like the yellow stands out all right let's just see since we have the hex code right here or I shouldn't say the hex code because it's not what we're using but since we have this here we'll try that first if not I'm gonna try to track down a blue color that I know I'm using in a few other sites that I do like better oops I forgot we're not I don't have library though alright so that was a good time oops and you make sure we apply that to both and then let's just get all of them just to be sure I'm not gonna test it out to see if this is necessary it's just so quick to to type this out all right so let's go through our little flow here we're gonna take our Styles move it into our template we're gonna save that and then we're going to take all of this and move it over here now you'll see this looks a little bit different I wanted to show you all the newer version I think they call it the lightning experience so this with the newer version looks like and also if you remember yesterday I was super frustrated by how tiny this this window was here with the with the code so I went in dev tools and made it a lot bigger I'm thinking about using tampermonkey to write a script to just change this but I don't know if it's worth it it depends on how much I'm going to be working with this if I'm going to work with it a lot then it's going to annoy me so maybe I will wear a script but for now since I'm just copy and pasting in there it doesn't really matter it'd be worse if I to edit it directly okay let's check this out okay okay so that's working out like we wanted two buttons here the yellow I don't know how I feel about that yellow yeah I'm not sure I think I might change it I think I'm gonna leave it for now just kind of get used to it and then maybe come back to it later on so let's make a note let's see can you do inline notes now you can't well at least let's see if you could do this I don't think you know what I think you can do it in SAS but not in regular CSS I don't really know it doesn't matter I'll put it right here okay all right I'm just gonna look quickly oh that actually changed that as well that's interesting so I guess this is an a tag and this is not actually I don't really hate these being two different colors I'm but I'm gonna revisit those again I really don't want to mess with the colors too much well I have a different font because the font the the type of font and then especially the font weight plays such a huge role in how things look a color might be fine and with one font and with another font it'll make it unreadable so let's get the right font in here now I keep saying we need to change the font so let's just do it now so I'm gonna go through I could just copy the font from a other project but I think it might be a good idea to go through how to grab a font so we're gonna get a Google font let's see so I just typed in Roboto Google font am I good at google fonts okay now there is a home page the google fonts where you can browse different fonts and pick what you want so you can go to that if you're not sure what you want but since we knew exactly what font we wanted we're just going to go right to it so you can see a lot of information about the font but what we want to do is select it so we're going to go up here and select this font and then we have this little you know drawer down here and it'll give us several options for how to embed this font we can also customize the font so we can see we can grab what we want so right now we're just bringing in the regular 400 font weight but I want to bring in light medium bold and I'm not sure if we're using italic anywhere yeah I'm not I'm not sure I'm not gonna bring in any italic now if we find somewhere where we see us our text will bring this in but for now this is good if we end up not using one of these font weights we can always redo it later because this is a lot to load it gives you a low time estimate of moderate we'd rather get it to be fast so I'm thinking we actually might not need the medium at some point but we'll see for now I'd rather have it so that I could see what they look like you can also pick languages so we're gonna stick just with Latin I'm I don't sorry I don't mean languages in the sense of a I know it says languages but these are really more characters I'm not sure why they have languages as the title there okay so we can do it two different ways we can do the standard way or we could use the import and I'm not sure what would be the best hmm I don't know I think I'm gonna try to do the standard way since we have access if if I only had access to a stylesheet it's nice that you can import it as well but let's put this in right above our style I'm gonna bring this in and see you can see it it tells us all our font sizes here and now we'll just copy this and before I paste this into our our style sheet let's see where they're bringing in their font if they're putting it on the body tag or down lower let's see okay they are oh they're bringing it on the HTML tag okay that's interesting I think will bring ours in on the body tag there should not be anything that displays outside of the body and that's true so I'm gonna put it on the body tag and I'm gonna do this like this so HTML body that way I'm positive that at least at this level my font family is more specific than theirs so it should override theirs we may find some cases where they've added a font family you know down lower or something more specific but we'll we'll figure that out when we get to it so with these I want to test this out and let's keep forgetting where I have these windows actually you know what I really want to do whoa Oh interesting so it's giving me an error for my link tag interesting let's see if I couldn't just do this okay so it would not let me put this link tag in without terminating the tag which is fine um obviously we've been doing react for so long we're used to doing that so normally I would but since we just copy and paste it in I didn't even notice okay anyway I was going to say if I end up using tampermonkey to put a script in I think I'm gonna put in a button that can just make this fullscreen because I don't need any of this stuff around the edges it's just taking up a lot of space and I'll never need to select anything so that might be useful to have a nice you know fullscreen I don't know what these buttons do maybe there is a full screen you know that's a search this is like oh okay there is an undo redo increase font size decrease this is the most barebones editor of I've seen at least it tells you the positions it's probably hard to see that fonts are really small but it does tell you your the line numbers so not bad but very basic ok let's see what this is nice let's verify that we are getting the correct font so we're just going to click on a font here and we'll go to computed and see computed is usually the easiest way to find something specific yep it's the right font let's try one other place just to be sure it all looks right but yep there we go okay wonderful great alright so with the exception of a few things that we're going to think about and maybe come back to later on this is not bad we may change this add some things I don't know but I don't want to make any serious design changes until I get some input from other people at the University here because it's honestly going to be a waste of effort if other people have strong opinions and more authority than they permit it to how to do something right now okay let's see alright I got about four minutes left and then I'll do question answer so if you've been asking questions just hang on for four minutes and then I'll get to them okay now let's check this sign up view and make sure that it looks right if everything's right with that then we're actually going to sign in if you remember yesterday we tried to sign in and it looked a mess so we're gonna have some work to do so let's sign okay interesting interesting maybe there's an inactive class I'll have to check that out as to why these colors are changing but this looks fine it looks like all our styles are being applied oh that's a problem I don't know if you notice that when we need to let's see what it does here all right this spacing is fine but we need to add some more space between this and this so before with the other font it was it wasn't overlapping but now you can see it's actually overlapping that T and the GR overlap so that's not good this kind of thing I don't want to make myself sound like I'm an expert or anything but I really think that when it comes to CSS stuff attention to small details like that are the difference between a really good site in an okay site it's not the type of thing that every user is going to notice but if a user does notice it it's gonna drop their confidence in your brand or your company or anything at least it definitely does for me if I notice little things like that I think if this company doesn't pay attention to these little details on their own sites are they gonna pay attention to the little details when dealing with me with whatever product or service that they're offering so I've I've actually just refused to look at anything else on a company's web page because I noticed little things like that or even bigger problems and I think I basically just in my head think if they don't care enough about me as a user to fix these things then that's not really the people that I want to work with so at least to me it's a big deal maybe it's just because I do this and I notice those things but I mean if you went to a building right and the steps were all cracked and it was hard to get in and it was kind of you know dirty he it would be leave a bad impression right it's the same thing with a website you come to companies web site and things aren't quite right it makes an impact on people alright so and enough of my my speech on CSS let's fix this okay so our h1 let's grab this class and application and title let's let's put this down in the card Styles section since we're inside the card so in our card style section this this is about the entire card the wrapper so it makes sense that the title would be underneath that so I'm trying to give some structure to the CSS I'm not following a specific methodology but better to get do try to do something then just have a mess of things which if you've all watched the streams for previous projects you know I have a tendency to make a mess of the CSS if I'm not careful okay so let's just change this bottom margin a bit marginbottom and let's go with I know they're doing EMS but I'm just way more comfortable with pixels I can usually tell how many pixels I need just by looking at a thing and I can't with with other units it's got a 24 because what we really want oh yeah that's that's much better let's zoom out of it yeah perfect I like that okay so let's grab this and paste it over great okay I'm not gonna bother testing this right now it's pretty basic it should work and my timer is just ran out so let's take our five minutes do some question and answer let me scroll up to the top and I'm gonna work my way down and get to as many questions and comments as I can if I don't get to your question during this session after our next 25 minute session of coding then I'll get to all the questions so red asks is it possible to learn Python on free code camp so as far as I know free code camp there there exercises or challenges whatever they call them it does not deal with Python but potentially free code camp is more than just those lessons so you have the YouTube videos you have the forum you now have the guide which deals with a lot of different topics so there may be other free code camp resources that could help you learn Python but in terms of the specific challenges that are on the main free code camp site I don't believe there's any Python in there they are working on a new curriculum as far as I know there's no Python in that either I could be mistaken so if anybody I know some of you that watch this are also working on helping with other things in free code camp so if I'm wrong about that let me know but I tell you where is a decent place for me to pick up the little bit of Python knowledge that I know is Udacity is intro to computer science course uses Python so if you also would like to get some background in computer science and learn Python at the same time that's probably your best route if you are already really confident in all these computer science concepts and you just need to learn Python syntax quickly then that might not be the best for you you might want to try out code academies and browser exercises I believe they have Python I'm not 100% sure it's been a while since I was on their site but those would be my top suggestions hopefully that helps okay harsh it says I have a question what is the benefit of using Salesforce let's see you may have used Google forum for submissions yeah so the benefit with Salesforce is really in I don't know how much I don't want to show you too much in the Salesforce because we have student data that you're not supposed to show anyone so I don't want to accidentally show that on YouTube because the university could get in a lot of trouble for that and so could I so I'm just gonna try to describe a little bit about the other things that Salesforce does this is probably I'm sure you could check it out on their website but basically the ability to track and run reports on all the data easily from a pretty simple user interface is one of the strengths of Salesforce there are a lot of other additional things Salesforce can do with that data like sending emails automatically depending on what stage of the journey they're in you can get sales horses like you pay for the base product and then you pay for these addons so depending on what addons you get it can do other things were maybe going to get an addon soon I hope we do where we could define routes a basically a decision tree for new students or donors or whoever depending on what actions they take they go through entirely different route of automated emails and mailings and phone calls and different things that could happen so that we can really customize the experience for each prospective student so that they get the materials that are of most interest to them based on you know where they're at what major they're interested in what sport they're interested in playing so I think it'll be a nice it will help to automate a lot of the work that we are having people do right now that they probably there's no need for them to do manually so that'll be nice to free up some time for other people but then it'll also be really nice for the prospective students as well so that they don't get a lot of material that's irrelevant to them and kind of a waste of their time to go through so that's kind of the cool thing that to me that I've seen that Salesforce does there's so much more the Salesforce does that I have never seen or used so I don't want to limit it to that there's also some machine learning things that they're building in now that I haven't used so it can do so much more in this use case it's basically online form right we could do this ourselves and it would be easier honestly to build out the form in just plain HTML CSS set it to a Google sheet and be done with it but we wouldn't have access to all those other things and it wouldn't tie into other systems that we have on campus so anyway hopefully that explains it a bit I am by far not a Salesforce expert so I'm sure I'm not doing it justice in terms of what it can do okay let me go I was just checking now I don't think I was hoping I'd get down to the bottom of the chat but there's too much there now so I'm just going to mark down where I left off and we'll get back to it after our 25 minute code session okay all right so what was next all right we fix this now we're gonna login I thought did we log in yesterday why am i logged out of I'm gonna grab the grab what I need on this other screen evidently I have several accounts for this now that I'm checking in my my last buzz okay all right I should work whoa wait wait wait hold on yeah you all saw this yesterday right it did not look like this yesterday it this is what did we click on yesterday that looked so crazy all right we need to check this out okay this is our video from yesterday this is what it looked like yesterday and then now it looks like this I'm happy that it looks like that but I don't know well hopefully at some point we'll get this screen again and can see what the problem is all right wow that's pretty crazy okay well I'm happy about this so the styles that we've applied here and to the button are still working as well as our font so that's good news this might take less time than I anticipated so let's go ahead and start the online app why why do they make me click that and then click another button alright that's not really something I can change I don't think that was a good user experience decision though all right let me see I'm just kind of checking the font size is a little small for me that looks like twelve or fourteen yeah it's fourteen let's make that bigger where are we getting that fourteen from I like to set my minimum font size at sixteen pixels so how is this Christian's contain Wow this one is at 12 point font yeah we definitely need to make these bigger these should both be at least 16 let's see if we can see if we put it on here on this element if we can get it to affect the elements below it I don't think so but it's worth a shot whoops it's 16 no but can we get here we go no I don't want that now it affected this font size as well all right I was just trying to get around being really specific with these classes but I think we're gonna have to so let's go to this one I guess we could use not yeah let's just do that let's try to use and knots and knots will that work yeah that worked awesome I like that okay let me copy and paste this and then explain what I did in case you're not familiar with this selector we're gonna put this under let's go with loops do not mean to hit that let me make this a bit bigger I'm sorry I should have made this bigger earlier okay okay so here's what I did hopefully you can see this you know what I want to let me reset these settings is I don't want this to get cut off by my face so I need to set this so that we can scroll past the bottom core settings scroll past end okay that's a good setting I I like to have this setting on all the time I don't know how it got turned off at scroll past end and Adam lets us do this which can be useful if you don't want to have things right at the bottom of your screen so right now here's what we're doing we've selected that target X application percentage container which was our full container and then instead of having to go through each one of these spans and select the the class because we didn't want it to apply to one of the spans so instead of having to select each one of these separately we just added a knot and then put the class that we didn't want to have in there so this is so much more concise so that's that's what we've done there in situations like that it's it's really nice and it saves some code alright it's ok I'm ok with this the only thing I might change I'm not worried about right now is this red I don't understand why they're going with red for that that usually indicates that something's wrong like an error so maybe it will change that and see I'm just really interested in seeing what it looks like when we start so let's move on to that okay not bad let's ensure that our Styles okay so our button styles are not applying whenever this disabled class is there let's see what happens when we apply okay great now our styles do take effect so that's okay let's make sure that our card styles are there it looks like it but it can't hurt to doublecheck target excon interesting no they didn't apply okay but we do have a nice class too to latch on to here so we have this target X card so let's grab that and we should be able to just add this to our card styles and we already have so here's our card Styles it's interesting on that first page they don't use this card class on what is essentially a card so that's a little bit odd okay but that should take care of this card also I want to fix the same thing that we had going on before with the spacing let's see Target X application form title let's make sure okay great we should be fine we just never pasted those styles over so I'm not worried about that let's see dab this blue color is on these dropdowns so we may change that and they are actually really small all right I'm not going to change it right now right now going through I'm trying to differentiate between things that if I have time I would like to do and things that really should be done so this category here of things are things that I think aren't necessary to do so we're gonna hold off on these what we would do is change the color and the size and positioning of these a bit so that they're in here more but I'd rather kind of go through everything and look for major issues alright so let's start now the problem with this application is going to be that there are things that I won't see depending on what choices I make hopefully there's nothing like really different that I should be seeing it should just be what questions I get shown or not oh all right so this is see that this is a good illustration of the difference like this obviously is something that needs change this is ridiculous oh well interesting on this page these arrows are much more reasonable in terms of size I wouldn't say errors what do they call these Chevron's okay all right so the only problems I see here right now are the logo is way too small this button needs styling and the text is way too small in a lot of places here you know down here inside this select this button these styles oh do you see this we're definitely going to take away that I'm not a fan of this here yeah all right so we're gonna take away that animation let's see what happens hmm that's a cool effect we'll want to change the colors here of this sidebar I think the font size should be larger here I'm thinking more of on a phone it that click the tap targets need to be I would say at least 40 pixels tall and that's there's no that's nowhere near 40 interesting this is going to need some work on mobile I'm actually really surprised that it looks like this one on a mobile device I'm gonna have to I'm not gonna do it on the stream since you won't be able to see unless I get my phone in but I'm not a fan of this I'm surprised this should be centered maybe it is centered in terms of the entire width but they're not taking to account this little sidebar and they should so it should be centered it should exclude this width and then be centered here yeah so that definitely needs some work there's no reason why we can't show the logo as well I mean I'm all for a really slim navbar on mobile because there's not a lot of screen space but I think we could stand to be a little bit taller here and keep the logo otherwise there's there's no branding at all for the University okay let's see how much time I have nine minutes all right that would be a good time to make some some notes about this because I just noticed a lot of things I'm definitely going to forget I'm after the questionandanswer session so let's grab a Trello board and make these issues I mean normally well I wouldn't say normally I was trying to test out doing a github project instead of a Trello board but I'm not even really putting this on github right now so and I don't know if I ever will so let's just go with the Trello board I forgot on Chrome Canary and I don't have any much stuff save alright I'm gonna make a new one and potato this first application and I'm just gonna go with the blue for now okay I'm not gonna do all my Kanban rows here right now because I just want to get these ideas out of my head and onto something before I forget as fast as I can okay so let's say vacation and I'm gonna give these estimates pompadour estimates while I'm doing these I probably wouldn't need a whole Pomodoro cycle to fix that but it's easier to type 1 than 0.5 let's see okay so the first three in case you can't read these it's a fix button colors in the in the nav here change the side nav colors increase font size and and items on the side nav change icon colors and we're going to make all fonts at least 16 pixels and let's let me check this up because I think what's happening is they're using gray instead of black with opacity so let's double check this I didn't give me what I wanted oh there yeah see is this it so they're Gray's are actual grace we don't want that we want Gray's that are black with opacity set and I can't find whether where they have this label there it is let's see okay yeah see that's great let me change this right now just to show you what it different so I'm looking I'm a zoom in here on this name where it's his name right here and let me change this so let's bring this up and let's pick up let's just pick a black so we're gonna do black first and then actually let me switch No there we go let's go 54 okay this is going to be hard to tell because we we don't have it side by side but basically hopefully you're able to see and you can go back and rewind the video and see it's so much easier to read text that's black with opacity with I'm sorry transparency yeah you could say either way transparency or opacity but basically it's 54% is the standard that I do when I want to do input fields 87% is the standard color for all other text but it's so much easier to read when you do that as opposed to using a very similar color but using the hex code for gray in this case it was cccccc yeah I think that was right so anyway that's just a good tip that's actually in the material design guidelines so I didn't make that up myself or discover it myself but anyway that's a good tip so let's just say in our Trello board okay all right what else did I see we remove that hover effect for these buttons scroll down so required field shows up as red I'm gonna have to think about that that seems a little extreme I have a show up that red let's see Center courts on mobile let's see okay okay not bad so far let me check my timer alright I got a minute left so we're gonna stop there we got a little bit here down there so not not too bad all the the big things are there Oh actually I want to change the colors on these indicators there we go all right I'm just gonna start with the question answer session a little bit early since I don't there's not that much I'd get done in another minute so let me scroll up to where I left off so at this point in the stream I'm finished for the most part with the coding portion so if you're not interested in the question answer session and that would be the time when you might want to take off otherwise please stick around and help answer questions or ask some questions of your own okay and see the heart rook said please add some space between username and signin when you click it yes that was exactly what I was thinking so good call on that sorry I didn't look over and see that sooner okay Harshad has some good advice here Harshad says he found an online wire framing software called Sigma fi GMA which is as good as sketch and it is free so check that out I just heard of it so I can't recommend it but check that out figma comm fi GMA calm thanks for the say the suggestion Harshit John Hanson says with Google Fonts is it ever worth it to actually put their CSS into your code or best to leave as a relative link Harshit says I guess for Roboto it's good to use the the link because it's usually cached it's quite a popular font yeah I agree and I think that that would harsh it said can apply across the board to different JavaScript libraries and CSS libraries and things if it's very popular you might get better performance in terms of load times by using the the link from a CDN or something like that if what you're using is not as popular then you might get better performance by having it you know within your code base so it's a good idea when you come to the testing phase for you know site speed to try it either way then and see what kind of results you get it looks like those sign up and login links that we were seeing on the first page that for me were two different colors were not two different colors for some of you so maybe I thought we'd changed it for visited as well right didn't we do that yeah maybe active there's got to be some sort of active or inactive class that's going on or off to check that out more closely later on that'll up probably fall under the category of little things that don't absolutely need done but if we have time we'll do it okay rook says the courses from Rice University on Coursera are also good for Python they're free to audit so awesome thanks for for pointing that out rook there's a lot of free courses out there it is really good to hear what other people say about the courses because otherwise it's like which one do you pick you know there's so many free courses not just for you know stuff like we do but all different fields world's asked do you see things like Salesforce take away possible dev jobs in the future I I don't know that I know enough about this to give a good answer but based on what I do know here's what I think the something like Salesforce would help to cut down on a lot of manual work that's done but not necessarily by developers I'm talking about data entry work manually filing things manually making spreadsheets and copying things over so in that sense I don't think those are necessarily things that devs would be doing and for Salesforce if you want to do custom things then you sometimes need a dev so I can see it going another way and there's now this whole niche of Salesforce devs that can develop you know add ons to Salesforce or change the look right now with the level of permissions that I have in Salesforce I actually have higher permissions than most other people from the University because I need to access some some of the code but I don't have permissions to change everything but if I did I could change the look of the the whole UI for the the admin panel in Salesforce you can change quite a bit so I imagine there are dev opportunities because of Salesforce where there weren't opportunities before now certainly are there going to be opportunities as many opportunities for devs to build something like this from scratch you know proprietary systems for different institutions no but I don't know that that was a that'd be a good situation anyway I that would be kind of a mess I think to have to go in in every different place has their own custom built system I don't know so I guess my short answer is I'm of the opinion that this would not take away depth it might just shift dev jobs Harshit says did your famous IT department finished the single signon yes they did actually let me let me show you what this single signon looks like I don't think I showed you this I did work on some of the styles it didn't turn out exactly like I would like I wanted it to but it was a weird workflow where I couldn't edit any Styles directly I had to send them to the head of the IT department and then she forward them on to another company and then somebody at that company had to actually put the styles in we had a lot of trouble going back and forth where the code that I gave them didn't get inputted into the right place or properly and so finally I just tried to make as complete of style sheets as I could and then send them and say exactly where to put them and then for the most part it worked out but there's still a lot of would change but the the feedback loop was just so slow like we're talking like weeks before I could see what the changes were so I did what I could do you know considering all the other projects that I had going on so you all could go to the login screen if you wanted to it's access FUS dot franciscan ddu you won't be able to get past the login screen though so let me show you I actually can log in as a student or as a staff member Oh Logan as a staff member I think there's more to see there so basically the background image wasn't my decision that was already there when I started working on it I don't know that I would have put a background image there but there were so many other issues that I just left that alone there is one cool thing that you can see here in the image that's kind of weird I don't know how many people noticed this but it was a like a long exposure photo so some students were walking here and you can see a couple things one you can see a shadow on the wall but you can also see this faint outline of so a student's shoe in their leg so it looks like there's a ghost there so anyway cool little easter egg that I don't know how many people will notice but anyway you can see I added the proper card style shadows borderradius the right effect for the button changed the font to Roboto another thing that's really weird is this look at that that's an image I have no idea why they couldn't just put in text I'm pretty sure that's an image inside of an H tag that's another one of those things that I recommend it to them to change and it didn't get done so I just left it alone they are using the older logo on on this screen which is fine I think it works better in this situation once we log in we'll see the newer logo so we have the new logo here we have the the newer styles for the header I would have liked to have done more with a search but like I said there are a lot of other problems this black line was added after I already submitted all my Styles I would not have this this thick and this color I would make it much thinner and a grey color but maybe you know this will be the next round of changes I'm hoping now that it's completed we'll actually have more access to do some changes on our own but I'm not sure I also made these work cards kind of but they didn't have the right style so now they have the right styles the border radius the shadows a hover effect since they're all clickable I have a hugger cover effect normally I don't recommend a hover effect on a card unless the entire thing is clickable so anyway the university bulletin is on here currently and that's what we've been working on as the project for I think so I'd love to have it integrated into this I think they're using a saml for a single it's the single signon so still need to talk more with the IT department to get in there their last suggestion why don't you just make it so that you can only see the bulletin if you click on this link within here I don't think that's the best idea I mean it's I'm not even sure how it would implement that and it would actually be secure but even if I could then that would mean that nobody could actually go directly to the bulletin so any bookmarks of the bulletin wouldn't really work you'd have to come through here so rather not do that so we'll see hopefully you can get it integrated better so anyway this is it you click on it you're automatically logged in so not bad I'm actually I'm really excited that they got this working it's something that they've wanted for a really long time and yeah so I'm happy I'm proud of the IT people for you know getting this together and working so and I'm happy that you know they asked me to work on the Styles too so that was really cool I think well it shows that they know that I'm I'm good at this I guess or good enough that they wanted me to do it and that they care about the look of the sites which i think is awesome so always happy to collaborate with other departments whenever possible and so this was cool and that's cool the head of the IT department is really nice she's a really smart woman and I enjoy working with her so so this was kind of a cool project just a little one but it was nice alright let me go back to the live chat Oh on Anson's has going to the gym for a workout my wife somin is making me go what can I say well I guess you gotta gotta keep your wife happy right that's your marriage means more than then you're coding right keep it in perspective so see you tomorrow it's on okay Blake says thanks for the pool request but now everything is undefined okay so earlier today I submitted a pull request to one of Blake's projects yeah so let me so here's what I was you're getting undefined everything is undefined what are your here's what I would check Blake what are your headers look like on your Google sheets because that's what because if you if you're actually getting information to go to your Google sheet and saying undefined then that means a lot is that is going right so that's a good sign but we need to make sure that one the data getting sent is in the right format which it ought to be you just need serialized data and then we also need to make sure that the headers match up exactly with the names so let me okay let's check this out Blake do you mind if we check this out on on the live stream right now I don't want to check it out if there's any data in there that we I shouldn't show but it would be cool to show everybody a little bit more about how this works so just let me know I'll open it on and on okay cool all right so let's open this up here and let me get rid of this dot and this asterisk okay okay here's this is SSS okay so we have this awesome let's put in another row that that should be helpful another column I mean come on another clone won't you let me put another oh it's view only I'm gonna send a request for edit access if you don't want to give it to me that's fine I'll just tell you what to do here but I'd like to add another column for the time stamp because that can be helpful let me check out the repo as well oops on the wrong wrong repo okay let me see oops dang it okay good timestamp and let's make sure okay it looked like there was a space at the end of named so that potentially could be that could have been the problem with name so let's see so that may work now and let's see that's fine doublecheck this yeah okay let me show you I think I still have my stuff up okay so this is so this is exactly how I had it set up so I was able to get everything to come through at at one point so it looks like hmm interesting yeah I'm I'm pretty sure the issue with the name was that extra space at the end so that should work now because that was consistently undefined let me check out I mean if you want to test that again maybe it'll work yeah gasps is that a SteelSeries Siberia headset by the way those are really comfortable yes it is that's crazy that you were able to identify the headset from my tiny you know video in the corner they're so cool yeah I actually I really like these SteelSeries headsets I've been using them for and I think at least three years and they're great I get they are really comfortable occasionally my ears will hurt but only if I've been coding like all day and taught it like for like ten hours if I've had them on ten hours plus otherwise it's great audio quality I don't really know I'm not really an audiophile so they sound good to me it would be nice if they had a little bit more bass but it's not it's not a huge deal they're they sound good and it keeps the rest of the noise out from you know other things going on so it keeps me focused over the under fight says you won't be able to get past a login screen though is that a challenge actually yes if anybody can get into this access FUS somehow get to this screen and prove that you got to that screen then I don't know what you'll get you'll definitely get a shout out on the live stream at the very least but that would act that would really be awesome I would I wouldn't call out the IT department but I would like quietly just go to the head of IT and say you might want to check this out so that's how I prefer to handle things I have a lot of respect for the head of the IT department so I don't like to publicly call anyone out on stuff I'd rather give her the chance to you know handle it with her team quietly and I appreciate when when they give that same chance to me if something's wrong on my site so I'm a big believer and like going directly to a person privately when something should be changed instead of calling them out publicly calling someone out publicly in my mind should always be the absolute last resort because you can't ever take that back okay so I just saw one go in here does this mean that it works let me see all right cool thanks it's working yay all right and Blake if you I did change a lot of stuff for the Google the Google Apps Script stuff so if you want me to explain why I change the things I did let me know otherwise I mean if you can check it out and figure out what's going on then you know that's that's good too but I'd be happy to explain a little bit what I did I didn't really change that much at all with with the code that's on the site with the HTML or the JavaScript the the biggest changes were in that Google Apps Script and that's only because I I have used it I don't know maybe a half a dozen times on other sites successfully so I just pulled a lot of that code from my other site since I knew that it was already working okay Blake says and I'm assuming because of the Google script it sends the form to me but it won't send it to test a test comm yes so that area where I put test to test comm so let's check this out let's check out the script editor so if you've never seen this in Google this is really cool so on Google sheets you can have you can run JavaScript right in here this does not handle any es6 or beyond so just be aware of that that's why we're doing this ridiculous stuff here with concatenating all these strings and variables uhhuh instead of using template literals so I actually I I am part of a very large string on the the forums for Google Apps Script asking for es6 support but that's been going on for like two years so I don't know if they'll ever have it or when otherwise this is really cool so you can see when we're sending the emails okay it looks like you already changed that I'm really sorry if you didn't want that email shown on the live buddy I can't do anything about it now so sorry about that but anyway yeah so you can hard code the two email that you want to get so either your email or the email of whoever needs to be checking this at the company that you're building this for and then for this email that the user gets it pulls the email from its you know Eid up for a murdered email so it's just pulling that out from obviously an object and then so that's why there's two different templates because for the user right now we're keeping it simple and just saying you know hey we should receive your submission as a subject thank you of course you can add anything else you want but then for the person that's actually receiving they need the data right they need to know name email phone message so that's why we have two different templates and we're doing two different sends also I don't know how you have this set up if email is not a required field which I recommend it should be but so we don't get an error we have this send in an if statement so it'll only attempt to send it if there is an email otherwise you'll get an error so that's why we wrap this in an if statement but like I said I would recommend making the email first of all validating that it's a valid email and then also making it required so anyway I'm glad I can help with that so I mean i said i'm i'm really happy to help i've done it before so i've gone through quite a bit of oh no no more access how that's cool i've gone through quite a bit of troubleshooting with google sheets and sending form data Google sheets so no sense in you having to go through all that work better to share my information with you and save you a bunch of time okay let me go back through Michael says the background image has ghosts I think I saw Slenderman in there somewhere also yeah it is weird I didn't even notice it somebody in the IT department noticed it and told me and I thought we were gonna try to get a different image in there or Photoshop that out but I guess that didn't happen so I don't think it's a huge deal I think it's kind of a cool little easter egg but I don't know maybe we'll probably switch that image my boss looked at it today and said he wants to switch out the image so it'll probably happen at some point our suits is switching to Kali Linux now I will get through now if you if you don't know what Kali Linux is then you're not a hacker number one but also Kali Linux is Linux that comes preloaded with all these penetration testing tools in there so if if you're white hat therefore penetration testing to use it for good if your black hat then then they're hacking tools that can be used for for evil so if you're interested in that kind of thing check out Kali Linux if you intend on using it for evil though then you didn't hear it from me uhhuh see okay Blake says how do I redirect it to a thank you page okay so you want to thank you page to come up after the after the forum successful form submission yeah you could since you're using javascript to submit the form I actually recommend that you don't redirect to an entirely new page because that would cause a page refresh and that's unnecessary what I think might be better let's bring this up I think I have it on another screen okay so what I think might be better is when you submit the form you have equal either a modal pops up or something in the submit button maybe a little checkmark and it turns green something like that telling people that it was submitted I like that for two reasons one you don't get a page refresh which is nice but also it allows the user then to immediately fill out the form again in case they want to would they really want to I don't know but potentially maybe they they didn't put in the full message or they put in the wrong thing and didn't realize it till they sent it then they won't have to you know do any type of navigation at all they can just redo it so that's my recommendation and if you wanted to do that then what you want to do then is in your contact j/s here where it's this dot done do something that's where you'll want to do you know whatever so like you might want to do so maybe submit form something like this because that's the button right and maybe you could just do like CSS color background color and then do I don't know like green something like that would probably work so check that out if you're interested and want me to submit a pull request for that I can definitely do it I mean I I already have this in here otherwise this is where you'd want to do it and just make sure that the submit button is still active if they want to resubmit that would be that would be my suggestion I usually do modal's that pop up and say hey you know this worked but you don't you don't have to get that complicated with it just something really simple down here a check mark icon anything I think would work okay Blake says thank you you welcome Blake no problem oh cool Arshad says I started learning ethical hacking last month it's good cool yeah I've always wanted to get into stuff like that mainly to do penetration testing on my own sites and make sure that they're secure but I just really have in that time to get into it maybe one day Blake asks do an alert I wouldn't do an alert like not a JavaScript alert so I actually never recommend never doing JavaScript alert on JavaScript alerts on production sites it's so much nicer if you can actually make a modal that will appear because then you have much more control over the Styles cool okay so Blake Blake's gonna do it himself all right that's cool Blake just let me know if you have any trouble with it I think you'll be fine though Harshit says I will try a DDoS and sequel injection okay now officially I did ask you all to try to do this so if if you get in trouble for attempting to hack a university website make sure you tell the authorities that I'm a developer at this university and I asked you to do this test thing I don't want anybody getting in trouble for her for doing that so I'll probably get in trouble at that point but I don't want you all getting in trouble so see I'm doing these oh cool Blake said I'm doing the u.s. I'm trying to read how I would read this CyberPatriot competition this year that's cool I haven't heard of that competition what was it for okay ok so it's a competition for securing networks and computers awesome that sounds really cool you have to let me know when the competition is and how it goes so I'm I'm interested to hear how you do inflate gas how do how do I reset it so how would you reset the form then put it up there we go I think by default it depends on what you want to do if you go with if you go with the modal then you could just have us if you click outside of it it goes away or you can put a closed you know like a little X icon there if you go with something down here you could maybe do it so that when any of these inputs get focused it just resets this that's that's probably how I would do it because if they focus on an input then that means they probably want to want to change what they've done there okay cool rug says I finally made the livestream when it was going score awesome glad you could make the livestream ok Orson says I will not try I don't want to get in trouble yeah I didn't even think about it until just a minute ago like that's probably not a good idea to have everybody try to to hack that site just because I don't I don't know what the laws are in other countries but I've heard that in the United States at least like the laws are pretty strict about attempting to hack even if you don't intend to do any harm like but you could still get you can you still go to jail for that so I mean like I said technically I'm giving you permission but it may not even be it's I probably don't have the authority really to give you permission to do that but if you happen to see anything that would seem like something's off with the security you know let me know and I'll try to check it out yeah I mean I would imagine some of the yeah there's definitely some stuff we wouldn't want people to have access to so anyway I have gotten to the bottom of the live chat so I think I'm going to end the stream now to Thomas yeah pretty decent length of the stream we're coming up on almost two hours here so oh alright I get exhausted after these streams they like I love doing them but it definitely takes a lot of energy okay so thanks everybody for helping and for watching the stream and anyway I'm really glad that I could help you out with your project lake so if anybody everyone's help with your project let me know the best thing would be to send me the github repo because then I can actually see all the code but I'm more than happy to help I don't always have time to do things right away but I'll try to get to it when I can so I should be back tomorrow what's sorry Thursday Wow tomorrow's Friday the week just went by so fast yeah so I'll be back tomorrow probably around the same time 2 p.m. Eastern time and I think we'll be working on on finishing up this the styles for this I think it will take less time than we anticipated or at least that I anticipated so maybe we'll be able to finish this up tomorrow and then then move on to something else so thanks again for watching and until tomorrow have a great day
