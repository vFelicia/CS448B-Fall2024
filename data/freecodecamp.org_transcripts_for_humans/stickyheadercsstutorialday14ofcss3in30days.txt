00:00 - hello everybody welcome back to css3 in
00:02 - 30 days today is day number 14 almost
00:06 - halfway through all of the days today
00:09 - we are going to be continuing in a way
00:11 - from where we left off yesterday in day
00:13 - 13 which was a sticky footer so today
00:16 - we're going to be creating a sticky
00:19 - header let's do it
00:20 - so here is the info page again like day
00:23 - 13 we have an info page a student page
00:25 - and a final page so let me show you what
00:27 - that looks like the info page here gives
00:29 - you some instructions it says let's make
00:30 - a css sticky header there are three html
00:32 - files for this lesson index student and
00:35 - final.html i'll show you that in a
00:36 - moment you can click this button to view
00:38 - the student version
00:39 - you can click here to view the final
00:41 - version so let's check out the final
00:42 - version
00:43 - here it is you can see up here the
00:45 - header is neatly tucked at the top it's
00:48 - got a little bit of a border uh or a
00:50 - gradient maybe both in fact and then
00:52 - when i scroll it sticks to the top and
00:55 - it's slightly transparent so you can
00:57 - actually see what's behind the header so
00:59 - it doesn't actually take up too much of
01:01 - the the screen estate so to speak in
01:04 - your viewport so when you scroll it
01:06 - should stick to the very top when you go
01:08 - back up
01:09 - everything is good now if i go back to
01:11 - the student
01:12 - version right here
01:14 - you can see just the normal header we're
01:16 - going to turn that into a sticky header
01:18 - it doesn't actually do anything here so
01:19 - that's your job slash my job to turn
01:23 - that into a sticky header so why don't
01:26 - we jump over into our code editor and
01:27 - let's check out the files we have the 14
01:30 - sticky header folder with five
01:32 - individual files go ahead and download
01:34 - that folder open it up in your favorite
01:36 - code editor
01:38 - i suggest atom or brackets both are free
01:42 - and uh some of my
01:44 - veteran students may wonder why i'm not
01:46 - using coda too i do love coda too in
01:49 - fact i still use it
01:50 - but for these types of projects i like
01:52 - playing around with new software to show
01:55 - my students that hey you don't have to
01:56 - shell out a hundred bucks for a decent
01:58 - software uh code editor so adam is my
02:02 - poison of choice today and i am going to
02:04 - be opening up my files here so we got
02:06 - index.html it's very straightforward
02:09 - this is just the info page so you don't
02:11 - even really need to concern yourself
02:12 - with that the final.html looks a little
02:15 - bit like this
02:16 - we have a body with the class of sticky
02:18 - header lesson
02:19 - that is important
02:21 - because we're actually going to be
02:22 - selecting that class you could just
02:24 - select the body but specifically i want
02:26 - to select the class
02:27 - we have a div with the class of sticky
02:29 - header so this is the header
02:31 - in fact you might even want to change
02:32 - this to header
02:35 - the header tag to make it more html5
02:37 - semantic feel free to do that if you
02:39 - wish
02:41 - and in there we just have some text and
02:43 - then after that it's just some basic
02:45 - content i specifically put a lot of
02:47 - lorem ipsum in here in paragraph tag so
02:49 - that the page can be long enough to
02:51 - scroll
02:52 - it's the only reason i did that and
02:54 - everything else down here is just uh
02:56 - nothing that you need to concern
02:57 - yourself with
02:58 - student.html is the same markup we've
03:00 - got sticky header lesson and sticky
03:01 - header so we're going to
03:03 - modify that in our sandbox.css
03:07 - if at any point you want to refer to the
03:09 - final code final.css is there for you
03:11 - right here you can always go there and
03:13 - check it out
03:14 - now let's get started sandbox.css
03:17 - let's start with the very very top we're
03:19 - going to select body with the class of
03:21 - sticky heady sticky header lesson you
03:23 - could also just say sticky header lesson
03:25 - that would do just fine it would suffice
03:27 - the the margin top will be the same
03:30 - height as the height of the sticky
03:32 - header itself
03:33 - plus some space so i like to give
03:36 - let's say the sticky header is going to
03:38 - be 180 pixels tall we want it to be 180
03:42 - pixels tall plus some so maybe 20 extra
03:44 - pixels let's call it 200 pixels margin
03:46 - top 200 pixels
03:48 - good enough
03:50 - let's go ahead and style the sticky
03:52 - header
03:53 - now we're going to do is select the
03:55 - background we're going to say rgba
03:58 - and we're going to change that color to
04:00 - uh 242
04:01 - comma 57 comma 90 comma 0.9 if you're
04:04 - wondering where i got that
04:06 - i got it from photoshop i was designing
04:08 - this in photoshop found the color i
04:10 - wanted uh made it a little bit
04:11 - transparent and i looked at the rgba
04:13 - colors or the rgb colors and then i used
04:15 - a for the alpha the alpha channel
04:18 - at 90 percent
04:19 - so you can see here 242 is the first
04:21 - that's red
04:23 - g is green this is the the numeric value
04:26 - in the g in the green scale and then b
04:29 - is 90 90 in the in the b
04:31 - uh spectrum of the color and then this
04:33 - last value is the alpha channel
04:35 - also known as how much opacity you want
04:38 - that color to have so that's why i use
04:40 - rgba and now let's go down and we're
04:43 - going to simply say position fix now
04:46 - when you position fix something you fix
04:49 - it in place wherever you place it based
04:51 - on your your top value
04:54 - that you that you set so we're gonna say
04:56 - position fixed
04:57 - and top will be zero right at the very
05:00 - top
05:01 - and the height of the sticky header is
05:02 - gonna be 180 pixels remember we talked
05:04 - about that just a moment ago
05:06 - now
05:07 - the width of this needs to be 100 pixels
05:09 - because or sorry 100 the reason why it
05:11 - needs to be 100 wide is because when you
05:13 - position fix something uh it actually
05:15 - doesn't know how wide it needs to be so
05:17 - if you look in the browser here it's
05:18 - actually all jumbled over to the left so
05:20 - we'll fix that by simply saying
05:23 - width 100 percent
05:27 - now
05:28 - if i say that it's perfectly the right
05:30 - width and you can even see a little bit
05:32 - of the background there and it is fixed
05:34 - to the top so it is sticking there
05:36 - but um it's behind everything so we want
05:39 - it to be in front of everything and we
05:40 - will solve that with some z index
05:43 - uh we're going to change that to 99 that
05:45 - should bring it up in front of anything
05:46 - that's on the page
05:48 - and let's finish it off with just a
05:50 - little detail box shadow zero zero 10
05:53 - pixels
05:55 - rgba
05:56 - let's go for zero zero zero
05:59 - and 0.2
06:01 - save that and that should give it a nice
06:03 - look the problem here is uh the text so
06:06 - everything's stuck to the top and we're
06:08 - getting on the right track here but
06:10 - the the text doesn't fit within the
06:12 - fixed height
06:14 - and that's a problem so all we got to do
06:15 - is restyle that so let's go down below
06:17 - sticky header and we're going to simply
06:19 - style sticky
06:22 - header h1 let's start there
06:25 - and we're going to change the font size
06:27 - to 2.8 rem
06:30 - then the line height to 3.2 ram
06:34 - margin 0 auto
06:37 - let's save that and see what that looks
06:38 - like
06:41 - looking much better
06:42 - it's fitting within there now all i want
06:44 - to do is change the size of the small
06:46 - text so this is the h1 and then this is
06:50 - two small tags within the h1 i want it
06:52 - to be a smaller font size
06:54 - so that will simply be
06:57 - sticky header h1 small
07:00 - and then font size to ram something a
07:03 - little bit smaller
07:04 - and that when i refresh should solve the
07:07 - problem day 14 sticky header student
07:09 - version scroll down our sticky header is
07:11 - looking good you can see that that 200
07:13 - pixels right here
07:16 - is the distance the margin top of the
07:20 - of the content the body
07:22 - so that it gives some space so you have
07:24 - the 20 pixel gap here to make it look
07:26 - like margin
07:28 - from the sticky header and there is your
07:30 - sticky header uh i love sticky headers i
07:32 - use them in my websites in fact i think
07:34 - right now in my blog i have a sticky
07:36 - header when you scroll down it's just a
07:38 - nice way to keep the navigation at the
07:39 - very top your brand sticks to the top
07:42 - and your navigation sticks to the top
07:44 - one little
07:45 - tip or maybe challenge for you if you
07:47 - want to take this a little step further
07:50 - is use if you are familiar with
07:52 - javascript or jquery
07:54 - simply when you
07:56 - have a scroll event when you scroll down
07:58 - beyond a certain amount of pixels let's
08:00 - say
08:01 - 200 pixels the distance of this gap
08:05 - this whole
08:07 - header shrinks even more in size so that
08:09 - there is more space to read what's on
08:12 - the screen so maybe you want to shrink
08:13 - it to
08:14 - half the height let's say 100 pixels or
08:17 - 90 pixels if you want to go exactly half
08:20 - you need to shrink everything the font
08:21 - size maybe remove
08:23 - the small tags and just have sticky
08:25 - header so that you could fit everything
08:28 - and then when you scroll back up you can
08:30 - have that you know visible again
08:32 - feel free to try that if you want i'm
08:35 - not going to cover it in this because
08:36 - that's specifically a javascript or a
08:38 - jquery
08:39 - challenge but it's something that i do
08:42 - in my sites i love doing sticky headers
08:44 - but when you scroll down if you have a
08:46 - big header it covers a lot of the screen
08:48 - so you might want to change that height
08:50 - the alternative is just to make a
08:51 - smaller sticky header that's always
08:54 - stuck to the top now that's it for day
08:56 - 14 the sticky header i hope you enjoyed
08:57 - that lesson see you tomorrow in day 15
09:00 - for more css fun

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody welcome back to css3 in 30 days today is day number 14 almost halfway through all of the days today we are going to be continuing in a way from where we left off yesterday in day 13 which was a sticky footer so today we're going to be creating a sticky header let's do it so here is the info page again like day 13 we have an info page a student page and a final page so let me show you what that looks like the info page here gives you some instructions it says let's make a css sticky header there are three html files for this lesson index student and final.html i'll show you that in a moment you can click this button to view the student version you can click here to view the final version so let's check out the final version here it is you can see up here the header is neatly tucked at the top it's got a little bit of a border uh or a gradient maybe both in fact and then when i scroll it sticks to the top and it's slightly transparent so you can actually see what's behind the header so it doesn't actually take up too much of the the screen estate so to speak in your viewport so when you scroll it should stick to the very top when you go back up everything is good now if i go back to the student version right here you can see just the normal header we're going to turn that into a sticky header it doesn't actually do anything here so that's your job slash my job to turn that into a sticky header so why don't we jump over into our code editor and let's check out the files we have the 14 sticky header folder with five individual files go ahead and download that folder open it up in your favorite code editor i suggest atom or brackets both are free and uh some of my veteran students may wonder why i'm not using coda too i do love coda too in fact i still use it but for these types of projects i like playing around with new software to show my students that hey you don't have to shell out a hundred bucks for a decent software uh code editor so adam is my poison of choice today and i am going to be opening up my files here so we got index.html it's very straightforward this is just the info page so you don't even really need to concern yourself with that the final.html looks a little bit like this we have a body with the class of sticky header lesson that is important because we're actually going to be selecting that class you could just select the body but specifically i want to select the class we have a div with the class of sticky header so this is the header in fact you might even want to change this to header the

for you right here you can always go there and check it out now let's get started sandbox.css let's start with the very very top we're going to select body with the class of sticky heady sticky header lesson you could also just say sticky header lesson that would do just fine it would suffice the the margin top will be the same height as the height of the sticky header itself plus some space so i like to give let's say the sticky header is going to be 180 pixels tall we want it to be 180 pixels tall plus some so maybe 20 extra pixels let's call it 200 pixels margin top 200 pixels good enough let's go ahead and style the sticky header now we're going to do is select the background we're going to say rgba and we're going to change that color to uh 242 comma 57 comma 90 comma 0.9 if you're wondering where i got that i got it from photoshop i was designing this in photoshop found the color i wanted uh made it a little bit transparent and i looked at the rgba colors or the rgb colors and

going to simply say position fix now when you position fix something you fix it in place wherever you place it based on your your top value that you that you set so we're gonna say position fixed and top will be zero right at the very top and the height of the sticky header is gonna be 180 pixels remember we talked about that just a moment ago now the width of this needs to be 100 pixels because

enjoyed that lesson see you tomorrow in day 15 for more css fun
