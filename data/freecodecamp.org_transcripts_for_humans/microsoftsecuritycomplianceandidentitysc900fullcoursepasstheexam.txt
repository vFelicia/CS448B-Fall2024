00:09 - made available to you here on
00:11 - freecodecamp so this course is designed
00:13 - to help you pass and achieve microsoft
00:15 - issued certification and the way we're
00:17 - going to do that is via lots of lecture
00:19 - content and cheat sheets so on the day
00:21 - your exam you have a high chance of
00:23 - passing so you can put that
00:25 - certification on your resume or linkedin
00:28 - to prove you have that azure security
00:30 - knowledge and get that cloud job or that
00:32 - promotion you've been looking for
00:34 - so just a bit about me i'm previously
00:36 - the cto of multiple ed tech companies
00:38 - with 15 years industry experience five
00:40 - years specializing cloud i'm an aws
00:43 - community hero i've published many many
00:45 - free cloud uh courses just like this one
00:48 - and i love star trek and coconut water
00:50 - so if you ever meet me and know what to
00:51 - buy me for a drink
00:53 - i just want to take a moment here to say
00:55 - thank you to viewers like you because
00:57 - it's you that make these cloud courses
00:59 - possible if you're looking for ways to
01:02 - support more free cloud courses just
01:04 - like this one the best way to do that is
01:06 - to buy our additional study materials at
01:08 - exam pro dot co for this course in
01:11 - particular it's forward slash sc900 and
01:14 - here you're going to get study notes
01:15 - flash cards quizlets downloadable
01:17 - lectures downloadable cheat sheets uh
01:20 - practice exams and you can even ask
01:22 - questions and get some learning support
01:24 - if you want to know what courses are
01:26 - coming up next uh the best way is to
01:28 - follow me on twitter i love hearing when
01:31 - people have passed their exam or what
01:32 - you want to see next for a free cloud
01:35 - certification course so there we go
01:40 - [Music]
01:42 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
01:44 - and we are at the start of our journey
01:46 - asking the most important question which
01:48 - is what is the sc900 so it's the
01:50 - microsoft security compliance and
01:52 - identity fundamentals and it provides
01:53 - broad knowledge across microsoft
01:55 - security services so the certification
01:57 - will demonstrate a person can define and
01:59 - understand the xero trust model
02:01 - microsoft privacy m365
02:03 - defender and azure defender
02:06 - azure active directory and a broad
02:08 - overview of microsoft and m365 security
02:10 - services and the certification is
02:12 - generally referred to by its course code
02:14 - the sc900 and it's an essential
02:16 - certification no matter your azure path
02:19 - this course in particular is very
02:21 - lecture heavy and greatly involves azure
02:23 - active directory so that is something we
02:25 - can look forward to
02:27 - this isn't an easy course to pass and
02:29 - they're great for those new to security
02:31 - and compliance so here's my azure
02:32 - roadmap and there's a lot more azure
02:34 - certifications but we just kept the ones
02:36 - on the board that actually are relevant
02:38 - to our possible paths
02:41 - and so here is some
02:43 - suggestions i have for you and the first
02:45 - thing is that you definitely want to
02:46 - take the ac 900 first the sc900 while
02:49 - being a fundamental certification is
02:52 - much longer than these other ones and
02:53 - how it has a lot of information so it
02:56 - makes it a little bit more digestible if
02:58 - you take the az-900 first if you're
03:00 - taking a general pass such as the
03:02 - administrator developer onto your
03:03 - solutions architect or devops engineer
03:06 - this is going to really make it easier
03:07 - at the associate and expert level
03:09 - especially for the administrator because
03:12 - this particular certification has a lot
03:14 - to do with azure active directory
03:17 - now of course the security
03:19 - certifications should be the primary
03:21 - reason why you want to take this path
03:23 - and azure has four at the associate
03:25 - level this is the reason why we don't
03:27 - really do any lab content follow alongs
03:30 - within the fundamental course because if
03:32 - we did we'd just be
03:33 - making these courses because if you were
03:35 - to look into the exam guides for all
03:37 - these four certifications
03:39 - you're just going to be seeing the same
03:40 - information but us applying that
03:43 - knowledge and saying okay how do we do
03:45 - this for real okay
03:46 - so how long does it take to sta how long
03:49 - should you study to pass a certification
03:50 - well if you have one years of azure
03:52 - experience you're looking about six
03:54 - hours if you've passed your az 900
03:56 - you're looking about 12 hours if you're
03:58 - completely new so you're not taking the
03:59 - a900 going straight for it you're
04:01 - looking at 20 hours okay this one is a
04:04 - longer than any of the other fundamental
04:05 - certifications and i recommend about 30
04:08 - minutes a day for 14 days all right just
04:11 - keep it within the scope of two weeks if
04:13 - you can so where do you take this exam
04:15 - well you can do it in person at a test
04:17 - center or online from the convenience of
04:19 - your own home so there are two different
04:21 - uh data test centers that are partnered
04:23 - with uh microsoft and azure to uh
04:26 - deliver these the one is psi or pearson
04:28 - vue they both have in person and online
04:31 - uh i strongly recommend that you always
04:33 - do in person because it's a more
04:34 - controlled environment it's less
04:36 - stressful you don't have to worry about
04:37 - the internet going out uh or
04:39 - some other issue that might occur and so
04:42 - these are proctored exams that means
04:44 - that there's a supervisor somebody
04:45 - monitoring your progress as you take the
04:47 - certification
04:48 - so that you aren't cheating or things
04:50 - like that
04:52 - so what does it take to pass this exam
04:53 - well you got to watch the lecture videos
04:56 - you generally have to do hands-on labs
04:58 - for this one i'm going to cross this out
04:59 - because basically there's next to none
05:01 - in this course so uh you know it's more
05:03 - so
05:04 - watching the lecture videos
05:06 - you probably would like to get some paid
05:08 - online practice exams and if you do need
05:10 - one go to exampro.com and that's a great
05:13 - way to support these free courses that's
05:14 - how i'm able to make
05:16 - these for you at no cost okay
05:18 - for the content outline uh the breakdown
05:21 - is describe the concepts of security
05:22 - compliance and identity describe the
05:24 - capabilities of microsoft identity and
05:26 - access management solutions describe the
05:28 - capabilities of microsoft security
05:29 - solutions describe the capabilities of
05:31 - the microsoft compliant solutions and we
05:33 - will open up the exam guide in the next
05:35 - video here just to give you a more clear
05:37 - view what the contents of the course is
05:39 - for grading you have to get at least 70
05:41 - percent to pass so around that because
05:43 - it's using scaled scoring the response
05:45 - types uh we're looking at here well
05:47 - first of all there's 40 to 60 questions
05:49 - so you can get about 12 to 18 questions
05:52 - wrong some questions are worth more than
05:53 - one points there is no penalty for wrong
05:56 - questions
05:56 - some questions cannot be skipped and the
05:58 - format of questions could be multiple
05:59 - choice multiple answer drag and drop hot
06:02 - area or case studies
06:04 - the duration of the course just like all
06:06 - the fundamental certifications is one
06:07 - hour so you roughly get about a minute
06:09 - per question uh the exam time is 60
06:11 - minutes but your seat time is 90 minutes
06:13 - so your seat time refers to the amount
06:15 - of
06:15 - time you should allocate for the exam so
06:18 - this could include the time to review
06:19 - instructions read and accept the nda
06:21 - complete the exam provide feedback at
06:23 - the end and this certification well i
06:25 - normally say two two years because
06:27 - that's pretty much the standard but any
06:29 - fundamental certification just never
06:31 - expires and i i didn't put this in my
06:33 - other fundamental videos because i did
06:35 - not know that but apparently once you
06:37 - have it you have it forever so that's a
06:38 - pretty good benefit there so there you
06:40 - go
06:41 - [Music]
06:45 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
06:46 - and what i've done here is opened up the
06:49 - page where we can find the exam guide
06:51 - outline so if you type in sc900
06:53 - certification it should bring it to this
06:54 - page you scroll on down to your skills
06:56 - measured and you download the outline
06:58 - now at the top of these documents this
07:00 - is a very new certification it's not
07:02 - even a year old
07:03 - from the time i'm making this but a lot
07:05 - of times you'll see red text in this
07:06 - document the top you'll say there has
07:08 - been changes it scares people because
07:10 - they think that maybe the course is out
07:12 - of date but i'm going to tell you that
07:13 - unless they change the number here
07:15 - unless it becomes the sc901 or 902
07:18 - this course is going to be mostly
07:20 - relevant okay because they're only ever
07:23 - making my new changes they're never
07:24 - going to change huge sections of a
07:26 - course if they do then they're going to
07:28 - update the numbers so that's how you
07:29 - know whether my course is still relevant
07:31 - or not okay is whether the course number
07:33 - changes not if there's red text
07:35 - but going down below here
07:37 - we'll just quickly go through some of
07:39 - these sections and some of the thoughts
07:40 - i have about this course so we have the
07:42 - zero trust methodology is the first
07:44 - thing they want to learn xero trust
07:46 - model is super important it's the
07:48 - foundation of this entire course and
07:49 - ties over to azure active directory so
07:51 - you're definitely going to know that
07:53 - inside and out
07:54 - the shared responsibility model which we
07:56 - covered in the az900 nothing has changed
07:58 - there defense and depth that's like a
08:00 - seven-layer thing not super important
08:01 - common threats which are going to lay
08:03 - the foundation for some other services
08:05 - um
08:06 - encryption which is pretty
08:07 - straightforward stuff we covered in the
08:09 - az-104
08:11 - the microsoft privacy principles this is
08:13 - a bit confusing because they have two
08:15 - different pages but i cover both of them
08:16 - here so you know both of them the
08:18 - service trust portal where we can
08:19 - download audit reports
08:21 - so that's a very simple thing there
08:24 - primary security perimeter this is a
08:25 - concept of the
08:27 - zero trust model really should be up in
08:28 - the top section there author
08:30 - authentication authorization ipd so
08:32 - identity providers think facebook google
08:34 - linkedin twitter uh active directory
08:37 - which is a huge component of this course
08:38 - federated services identity attacks
08:41 - uh and so then we have um the notice
08:43 - here it says service identities for
08:45 - azure id capabilities of azure id
08:47 - management capabilities of azure id
08:49 - identity protection and governance
08:51 - capabilities of azure id
08:53 - so there's a lot of azure ad stuff
08:56 - a good chunk of this is actually covered
08:58 - in the az-104 so if you're taking that
09:01 - as your natural path like basically like
09:03 - half of this at least half of this is
09:05 - covered is actually the content's coming
09:06 - from there okay so that's going to be
09:09 - really great for you
09:10 - going down below here
09:12 - now we're into
09:13 - microsoft capability i guess still says
09:15 - azure so nsgs ddos azure firewall
09:18 - bastion web application firewall azure
09:21 - azure encryption data a lot of this
09:23 - covered again in the az-104 so it was
09:25 - very easy
09:26 - easy for me to bring this over
09:27 - simplified it more to a business use
09:29 - case for you okay the azure security
09:31 - center azure security score
09:33 - azure defender
09:35 - cloud security posture management and
09:37 - there's a lot of these terms uh
09:39 - like a lot of initialisms and we go
09:41 - thoroughly through them in the primer i
09:44 - actually squeezed in a primer a security
09:46 - primer in the front of this course
09:48 - because uh they just lack a lot of that
09:50 - information to uh help you understand
09:52 - the stuff and so i just did that to
09:54 - round out the entire course overall so
09:56 - you have azure sentinel where you have
09:58 - siem soars and xtr's
10:01 - then there's microsoft 365 defender and
10:03 - there's a lot of stuff with defender
10:05 - because there's azure defender and 365
10:07 - defender and there's all these sub
10:09 - services there's unbelievable amount of
10:10 - stuff in here so identity office 365
10:13 - endpoints
10:14 - cloud app security
10:16 - uh then you have the
10:19 - microsoft 365 security center so you
10:21 - have a security score there reports
10:23 - dashboards things like that that's
10:24 - actually how you access azure azure
10:26 - defenders through the
10:28 - m365 or sorry through the um uh security
10:32 - center um and then through uh um at my
10:36 - m365 defender it's through
10:38 - uh well actually just go to the security
10:40 - panel that's how you get to it you have
10:41 - microsoft intune that's for managing
10:44 - remote devices that's part of
10:47 - microsoft endpoint manager so you can
10:50 - remotely control or or
10:53 - have security over devices tablets and
10:56 - computers
10:58 - then we have here um
11:01 - uh the microsoft compliant solution so
11:03 - there's the microsoft um
11:05 - or m365 compliance center and there's a
11:07 - ton of stuff in this course like tons
11:09 - and tons i would say like a good quarter
11:11 - of this entire well it says 25 percent
11:13 - here but 25 percent of the course is all
11:15 - about the compliance center there's tons
11:17 - of stuff in here for that and actually
11:19 - that's the end of the course so yeah
11:20 - it's mostly azure id and the compliance
11:23 - center a handful of azure uh services
11:26 - and a bunch of marketing resources okay
11:29 - so there you go
11:31 - [Music]
11:35 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
11:36 - and we are starting our journey for the
11:38 - sc900 talking about zero trust
11:40 - methodologies or the zero trust model in
11:42 - particular
11:44 - and this is super important because it
11:46 - really lays the foundation of the way we
11:48 - should be thinking about uh all of the
11:50 - security that we're gonna be doing
11:51 - within azure and actually in any cloud
11:53 - service providers because the xero trust
11:55 - model is really uh what is being adopted
11:58 - today and we'll talk about why that is
12:00 - so the zero trust model operates on the
12:02 - principles of trust no one and verify
12:04 - everything so
12:06 - you have malicious actors and they're
12:08 - being able to bypass conventional access
12:09 - controls and demonstrates traditional
12:11 - security measures that's no longer
12:12 - sufficient we need to come up with a new
12:14 - way to protect ourselves and so that's
12:17 - where azure or microsoft in particular
12:19 - has come up with their version of a zero
12:21 - trust model called the microsoft's zero
12:24 - trust model and this is based on three
12:26 - principles and six pillars so in the
12:28 - three principles we have verified
12:30 - explicitly uh least privileged access
12:32 - assume breach for our six pillars we
12:34 - have um identities endpoints uh an
12:37 - easier way of thinking about endpoints
12:39 - is just think of them as devices apps
12:41 - data infrastructure and networks and i
12:44 - would say that if you wanted to put an
12:45 - emphasis on anything it's going to be
12:47 - identities
12:48 - which comes down to azure ad that seems
12:50 - to be
12:52 - the largest focus here in this entire
12:54 - course and to really ensuring the zero
12:56 - trust methodology works
12:58 - the xerotrust model is not unique to
13:01 - microsoft gcp has its own zero trust
13:04 - model aws has its own zero trust model
13:07 - but the one here is just gonna really
13:08 - work for azure okay
13:11 - [Music]
13:15 - okay so let's review the three
13:17 - principles we said that are in the
13:18 - microsoft zero truss model the first is
13:20 - verify
13:21 - explicity and so this always
13:23 - authenticates and authorizes based on
13:25 - all the available data points
13:27 - um the next one is lease privilege
13:29 - access so limit user access with just in
13:31 - time and just enough access for
13:34 - risk-based adaptive policies and data
13:35 - protection assume breach so minimize
13:37 - blast radius and segment access verify
13:40 - end-to-end encryption and use analytics
13:41 - to gain visibility drive threat
13:43 - detection improve defenses now you see
13:45 - me highlighting things in red
13:47 - and i'm not telling you what they are
13:49 - because we have a whole section on these
13:50 - things so don't worry if you see a bunch
13:52 - of terms and you're just getting
13:53 - overwhelmed uh we're going to cover them
13:55 - multiple times and so you just
13:58 - understand that we're going to front
13:59 - load you with a lot of terms you don't
14:00 - know but you will know them by the end
14:02 - this course okay
14:03 - [Music]
14:08 - all right so let's take a look here at
14:09 - the six pillars for the microsoft zero
14:12 - trust model starting with the most
14:13 - important one identities and this
14:15 - verifies and secures each identity with
14:17 - strong authentication across your entire
14:20 - digital estate
14:21 - and so for each of these pillars we're
14:23 - going to talk about some of the related
14:24 - services i'm not going to describe what
14:26 - they do because we're definitely going
14:27 - to be covering them all in this course
14:29 - in great detail but i want you to get
14:31 - some exposure so you see all these names
14:33 - again and again and again okay
14:36 - so the first is iam the next one is
14:38 - azure active directory and this one gets
14:40 - a lot of attention in this course they
14:41 - might as well call this the azure active
14:43 - directory security course
14:45 - we have single sign-on mfa
14:48 - password list authentication which is a
14:49 - subset of mfa
14:51 - risk-based policies identity secure
14:53 - score and you'll see like three
14:54 - different types of secure score in this
14:57 - course so something that is very useful
14:59 - uh throughout
15:00 - microsoft and azure
15:02 - we have endpoints and it's easy to think
15:03 - of these as devices because their
15:06 - endpoints are used to gain visibility
15:07 - into devices accessing the network
15:09 - ensuring compliance and health status
15:11 - before granting access the endpoint is
15:13 - what grants access for this we have
15:16 - azure ad device manager to register our
15:18 - devices with our identity provider
15:21 - generally the the controls underneath
15:23 - which is mobile device management and
15:26 - mobile application management is managed
15:27 - by intune and this service is now
15:29 - actually part of microsoft endpoint
15:31 - manager
15:32 - and if we want to get
15:33 - a protection around our endpoints then
15:35 - we have microsoft defender for endpoints
15:37 - but we got defender for everything in
15:38 - this course and you'll see that soon
15:39 - enough then you have dlps uh so data
15:42 - loss prevention policies so we do not
15:44 - lose our data so that we like it does
15:46 - not just get disclosed and we can keep
15:48 - our data our sensitive data
15:51 - protected right
15:52 - for apps we have discover shadow i.t so
15:55 - ensure appropriate in-app permissions
15:57 - gate access based on real-time analytics
15:59 - and monitor control user actions so
16:01 - there for this we have policy based
16:03 - access controls we can use the microsoft
16:05 - cloud app security
16:07 - azure 80 application proxy
16:10 - cloud discovery or i suppose that could
16:12 - have been e-discovery uh there's
16:15 - definitely a spelling mistake there so i
16:16 - think it's just supposed to be cloud
16:17 - discovery
16:18 - um we have just in time virtual machine
16:21 - access onto the last three pillars we
16:24 - have data so move from perimeter-based
16:26 - data protection to data driven
16:28 - protection use intelligence to classify
16:30 - and label data encrypt and restrict
16:32 - access based on organizational pro
16:34 - policies so here we can use sensitive
16:37 - sensitivity labels microsoft information
16:39 - protection data classification azure uh
16:42 - information protection so aip scanner
16:45 - decision-based policies and data loss
16:47 - prevention all of this stuff is in the
16:49 - microsoft at the if you're doing it on
16:51 - the microsoft side it's the m3s can i
16:54 - type text in here no i can't but it's
16:56 - the m365 compliance center this is where
16:59 - all this stuff comes into play uh we'll
17:02 - see later on so infrastructure used
17:04 - telemetry to detect attacks and
17:06 - anomalies automatically block and flag
17:08 - risk behaviors and employ least
17:09 - privileged access principles so here we
17:12 - can use the azure security center azure
17:14 - ad managed identities user and resource
17:17 - segmentation v-nets peering rules
17:19 - privileged identity management nsgs asgs
17:23 - azure firewall microsoft defender for
17:25 - endpoint microsoft defender for identity
17:28 - azure sentinel
17:29 - and the last one here is network i hate
17:31 - doing networking but it's a core to
17:33 - cloud you know so ensure devices and
17:35 - users aren't trusted just because
17:37 - they're on an internal network encrypt
17:39 - all internal communications limit access
17:41 - by policy and employ micro segmentation
17:44 - real-time threat detection so here we
17:46 - can do network segmentation azure ddos
17:48 - production service azure firewall the
17:51 - laugh vpn's proxies bastions ssl tls
17:55 - and so there you go that is all the
17:57 - pillars
18:02 - so we just defined what the zero trust
18:04 - uh model is and that's fine and dandy
18:06 - but how do we go ahead and start
18:07 - implementing it well they have a nice
18:09 - tool that can get us started here called
18:11 - uh the zero trust assessment tool and
18:13 - this is a free tool to assess your
18:14 - organization's degree of adoption
18:17 - towards the zero trust model and suggest
18:19 - uh to improve your current security
18:20 - implementations so it's basically a
18:22 - bunch of questions across the six
18:24 - pillars and then it'll give you
18:26 - a recommendations now we just ran over
18:29 - the six pillars and i actually went
18:30 - through this and extracted them all out
18:32 - for you so you basically just saw all
18:33 - them from the tool um but uh if you want
18:36 - to uh see more detailed steps uh that
18:39 - will be really useful okay
18:41 - [Music]
18:46 - i wanted to take a moment to actually
18:48 - show you the assessment tool because
18:49 - it's really easy to use you don't even
18:51 - need an account so all i did was i typed
18:53 - in zero trust
18:54 - assessment tool microsoft and i was
18:57 - brought to here and what the what you
18:59 - want to do here is just start at the
19:00 - beginning and we have identities and
19:01 - lasted some questions like have you
19:03 - enabled mfa authentication for internal
19:05 - users so i'll say some users because
19:08 - some of my users might not be good about
19:10 - it which forms of password list
19:11 - authentication are enabled
19:14 - so password list means you don't have to
19:15 - enter a password in so maybe we have
19:18 - phone call text phone microsoft
19:19 - authenticator i definitely use 502
19:22 - security keys we'll go next which of
19:24 - your user groups are provisioned with
19:25 - single sign-on
19:27 - and like does anyone use it so maybe my
19:29 - customers are using single sign-on
19:31 - which of the following security policy
19:33 - engines are you using to make access
19:35 - decisions for enterprise resources
19:38 - and if you don't know any of these names
19:39 - and you wouldn't check box them i know
19:40 - mobile device management so we'll do
19:42 - that
19:43 - have you disabled legacy authentication
19:45 - i'm not sure what they mean here but
19:47 - maybe you have like an old system that's
19:48 - not part of
19:50 - you're not using azure id so we'd say
19:52 - yeah maybe i'm still using a legacy
19:53 - system i haven't migrated to the cloud
19:55 - yet are you using real-time user and
19:56 - sign in risk detection to evaluate
19:58 - request access if you're using azure id
20:00 - and you have it turned on you'd know but
20:02 - we'll say no for using a legacy system
20:04 - what's the following technologies have
20:05 - you integrated with your identity access
20:06 - management solution if you're again a
20:09 - small company you might have not done
20:10 - much or maybe you've only done mobile
20:11 - device management that's usually one
20:12 - that's pretty common which of the
20:14 - following context is used for access
20:16 - policies
20:17 - um so like access policies like access
20:19 - to things so what is the context and i
20:22 - would say most people are going to be
20:23 - doing the user like what user's allowed
20:25 - to use it and a lot of these are never
20:27 - ever thought about so we'll go next are
20:29 - you using identity security score for
20:31 - guidance um actually i do but let's just
20:33 - say you said no and so the idea here is
20:36 - we'll get our results and it will give
20:38 - you like instructions so this is where i
20:39 - extracted all these little details for
20:41 - you in the slides there so you have to
20:43 - go through it but it describes it
20:45 - multi-factor helps you protect your
20:46 - applications by requiring requiring
20:48 - users to confirm the identity etc etc so
20:51 - explains them all right you could just
20:52 - answer no on everything it'll give you
20:54 - all the information at the end and it's
20:56 - very useful to read through this and and
20:57 - uh to understand it but again we cover
20:59 - this through the whole course so you
21:01 - don't have to read it here you just got
21:02 - to follow along okay
21:03 - [Music]
21:08 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
21:09 - and we're looking at azure's shared
21:11 - responsibility model all the cloud
21:13 - service providers have a shared
21:14 - responsibility model they're more or
21:15 - less the same
21:17 - and so this is just to tell you like
21:19 - what you are responsible for what azure
21:21 - is responsible for this is covered in
21:23 - the az-104 the az204
21:27 - and the az-900 and definitely we need to
21:30 - cover this again even if you know it we
21:32 - should go over it again for the sc900 so
21:34 - that we can think of it in the context
21:35 - of security so for responsibilities we
21:38 - have information data devices account
21:40 - identities identity directories
21:41 - applications network controls operating
21:43 - system physical host physical network
21:45 - physical data center and then we have
21:47 - saas paas iaas and on premise if you
21:52 - forget those terms the first is software
21:54 - as a service the software that
21:55 - uses that you use in the cloud so think
21:58 - 365. so word doc excel skype uh onedrive
22:03 - sharepoint dynamics crm you know if
22:06 - if imagine just
22:08 - all-purpose software but you access it
22:10 - via the cloud then you have platform as
22:12 - a service so deploy apps without
22:14 - worrying about the underlying
22:15 - infrastructure so azure app services you
22:17 - just have an app you put it up there it
22:18 - just works infrastructure is a service
22:20 - so the basic building blocks of cloud
22:22 - i.t so storage compute database is
22:23 - networking i call that the four
22:25 - uh you should always know that no matter
22:27 - what cloud service provider you're using
22:29 - on premise so data center owned and
22:31 - operated maintained by the customer so
22:33 - we'll do is just show you the blocks
22:34 - here and the blue represents the
22:37 - customer's responsibility okay
22:39 - i i know it's like
22:41 - you think like
22:42 - blue would be for azure but they made it
22:44 - blue and i should have really
22:47 - i should have really um uh put a legend
22:49 - on this because i always get confused by
22:51 - that as well
22:52 - but we're going to just do that and this
22:54 - is
22:55 - the customer okay so going down below
22:57 - here look at physical host networks and
22:59 - data center so azure is going to take
23:01 - responsibility if you're using ias
23:05 - paas or sas
23:07 - azure takes responsibility for all the
23:09 - physical stuff and there's a lot of work
23:11 - there if you had to secure that stuff
23:15 - now once you get you go up a bit more so
23:17 - if you're using
23:19 - an operating system at the pass or sas
23:21 - level you're still responsible
23:23 - or sir azure will take more
23:25 - responsibility here
23:26 - um but you know that's generally broadly
23:28 - how this works but if we just kind of
23:30 - break it down into three major
23:31 - categories i'm just going to clear our
23:33 - board here it's getting a little bit
23:34 - messy
23:36 - so
23:37 - and this this lines up to these lines i
23:39 - just didn't have lines in here
23:42 - but the idea here is this this is always
23:44 - the responsibility of the customer
23:45 - everything above here
23:47 - this is going to vary per service type
23:49 - the second tier and the bottom there the
23:51 - sp responsibility transfers by the cloud
23:53 - providers okay
23:55 - a few caveats here is that regardless of
23:58 - the type of deployment the following
23:59 - response responsibilities are always
24:01 - retained by you so data endpoints
24:03 - account access management so just
24:05 - remember those four there at the end
24:06 - okay
24:07 - [Music]
24:12 - let's take a look here at defense and
24:13 - depth and so there are seven layers of
24:15 - security that azure wants you to know it
24:17 - kind of maps up to the shared
24:19 - responsibility model a lot of times we
24:21 - see these things when um
24:24 - organizations or or cloud providers are
24:27 - talking about
24:28 - their
24:29 - security centers like the actual data
24:31 - centers and how they're secured but this
24:33 - is more general it doesn't necessarily
24:35 - have to apply to a data center but let's
24:38 - go and work our way through inside out
24:40 - okay so the core we have data
24:42 - so access to business and customer data
24:44 - encryption to protect our data then we
24:47 - have applications so um applications
24:50 - secure and
24:51 - free of security vulnerabilities then
24:53 - you have compute so access to vms ports
24:56 - on premise and cloud the network limit
24:58 - communications between resources using
25:00 - segmentation and access controls the
25:02 - perimeter so distribute denials of
25:05 - service protection to filter large scale
25:07 - attacks before they can cause the denial
25:09 - service for users
25:11 - identity and access so control
25:13 - controlling access to infrastructure and
25:15 - change controls and then you have
25:18 - physical security so limiting access to
25:19 - a data center to only authorize
25:21 - personnel so the idea is that if you
25:23 - really want to like if you want to get
25:24 - to data you got to go through all these
25:26 - steps here these are all the layers of
25:28 - defense
25:30 - um
25:31 - and so i just want to give extra
25:33 - emphasis to
25:35 - um
25:37 - this one here identity and access
25:38 - because this one's like the besides the
25:41 - physical security this one's the
25:42 - outermost one so they they will say like
25:45 - your your your perimeter like the modern
25:48 - perimeter is defined based on your i
25:50 - like your identity okay and we'll see
25:52 - that more here in this course
25:58 - hey it's andrew brown from exam bro
26:00 - we're looking at the cia triad and that
26:03 - stands for confidentiality integrity and
26:05 - availability and this model is used for
26:07 - describing the foundation to security
26:09 - principles and their trade-offs and
26:11 - relationships uh and so just to look at
26:14 - it here quickly so we have
26:15 - confidentiality so is a component of
26:17 - privacy that implements to protect our
26:20 - data from unauthorized viewers and
26:22 - practices can be using cryptographic
26:24 - keys to encrypt our data and using keys
26:26 - to encrypt our keys so known as envelope
26:29 - encryption you have integrity so
26:30 - maintaining ensuring the accuracy and
26:32 - completeness of your data over its
26:34 - entire life cycle and practice utilizing
26:37 - asset compliant databases for valid
26:39 - transactions utilizing tamper tamper
26:42 - evident or tamper proof
26:44 - uh hardware security modules so hsms or
26:46 - availability information needs to be
26:48 - made available when needed so in
26:50 - practice you want things to be highly
26:52 - available you want to mitigate ddos
26:54 - attacks you want to uh have decryption
26:56 - access that looks like there's a spell
26:58 - of mistake here something looks funny
27:00 - there but um the ca model was or triad
27:02 - was first mentioned in the nist
27:04 - publication in 1977
27:07 - uh there have been efforts to expand and
27:09 - modernize or suggest alternatives to the
27:11 - cia triad because it is really old right
27:13 - so one was like in 1998 where we have
27:15 - the six atomic elements of information
27:17 - so confidence confidentiality possession
27:19 - integrity authentication availability
27:21 - utility and then 2004 we have this
27:24 - engineering principles for
27:26 - information technology security um and
27:29 - they that that has like 33 security
27:31 - principles so
27:33 - um the thing with this triad is that you
27:34 - kind of get like a trade-off they say
27:36 - like if you go in full confidentiality
27:39 - you might have to make compromises here
27:40 - or there
27:41 - um to what degree i don't know but this
27:44 - is a very
27:46 - well-known model and so it's just good
27:48 - for you to note okay
27:49 - [Music]
27:54 - let's talk about common threats and
27:55 - these are in particular what azure wants
27:57 - you to know there's definitely a lot
27:59 - more than just four here but these are
28:01 - the four main ones that azure wants you
28:03 - to focus on before we talk about let's
28:04 - just say what is a threat so a threat in
28:06 - cloud security is a potential negative
28:09 - action or event facilitated by the
28:11 - vulnerability that results in an
28:12 - unwanted impact to a computer system or
28:16 - application
28:17 - and so as you're watching you know the
28:19 - following four types so the first is a
28:20 - dictionary tax so attackers attempt to
28:22 - steal identity by brute forcing into a
28:25 - target account by enumerating over a
28:28 - large number of known passwords and i
28:30 - actually put the word numerating in
28:32 - there because it's very common to see
28:33 - this when you are doing uh pen testing
28:36 - enumeration is very common uh but
28:38 - throughout the entire course i never saw
28:40 - them ever use that term so i figured hey
28:41 - i'll insert it there so you get to see
28:43 - it
28:44 - disruptive attack so an attack which
28:46 - attempts to disrupt a computer system or
28:48 - computer network for various reasons so
28:50 - that could be ddos coin miners root kits
28:52 - trojans worms
28:54 - ransomware a type of malicious software
28:57 - that when installed holds data
28:59 - workstations are a network hostage until
29:02 - a ransom has been paid we've heard of
29:04 - entire like cities
29:06 - being ransomed you know what i mean like
29:07 - the mayor has to pay some person
29:09 - somewhere to to get something back you
29:11 - know data breach so when a malicious
29:13 - actor gains
29:14 - unauthorized access to a system in order
29:16 - to extract private data so those are the
29:19 - core four threats they want you to know
29:21 - okay
29:26 - hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and
29:27 - we're looking at the concept of
29:29 - vulnerabilities
29:30 - so a vulnerability is a whole or
29:32 - weakness in the application that can
29:33 - beat a design flaw or implementation bug
29:36 - that allows an attacker to cause harm to
29:38 - stakeholders or an application the term
29:41 - is used throughout the sc900 course but
29:43 - they never describe it so here i'm
29:44 - describing it for you and i've actually
29:47 - pulled up a bunch of vulnerabilities
29:49 - from owasp owps is the open web
29:51 - application security project if you're
29:53 - in security you want to know what oh
29:54 - wasp is they have a lot of cool things
29:56 - there but i just got their big old list
29:58 - here so here's a big list and this is
30:00 - application focused uh but there's some
30:03 - that you might have seen before like
30:04 - buffer overflow ever heard of stack
30:07 - overflow that's kind of what they're
30:08 - talking about there take advantage of
30:09 - memory leaks least privilege violation
30:12 - so
30:12 - this is a very very common one where um
30:15 - uh the privileges aren't strict enough
30:18 - and that's where they can escalate their
30:20 - privileges
30:21 - uh or maybe we have like using a broken
30:23 - or risky cryptographic algorithm maybe
30:26 - like instead of using uh shaw you should
30:28 - be using bcryp things like that uh you
30:31 - know but i just want you to
30:32 - fundamentally understand what a
30:33 - vulnerability is it's a whole or
30:34 - weakness in an application okay
30:37 - [Music]
30:41 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
30:42 - and we're looking at encryption and to
30:44 - understand this we need to know what
30:46 - cryptography is so this is the practice
30:48 - and study of techniques for secure
30:50 - communication in the presence of third
30:51 - parties which we'll call adversaries and
30:54 - so encryption is the process of encoding
30:56 - so scrambling information using a key
30:58 - and cipher to store sensitive data in an
31:01 - unintelligible format as a means of
31:03 - protection an encryption takes in plain
31:05 - text and produces a cipher text
31:08 - um
31:09 - and so a very famous example of an
31:11 - encryption machine was the enigma
31:12 - machine used during world war ii uh and
31:15 - the idea was that you'd have to get a
31:17 - daily key and this would set the
31:18 - position of the rotors and these rotors
31:21 - would determine
31:22 - what ciphers would be substituted for
31:24 - that day all right
31:26 - [Music]
31:31 - hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and
31:33 - we were just looking at encryption and
31:35 - we saw the word cipher so i want to dive
31:37 - in and describe what that is so a cipher
31:39 - is an algorithm that performs encryption
31:41 - or decryption and cipher is synonymous
31:43 - with code so a lot of times ciphering
31:45 - code just means the same thing notice
31:46 - that this has an i and this has a y both
31:49 - are valid spellings i put both of them
31:51 - in here just so that you're comfortable
31:53 - with it if you're in canada or the uk uh
31:56 - we like to use the y if you're in the
31:58 - states or other places they like to use
32:00 - the i so both are okay
32:02 - when you use a cipher the output is a
32:05 - cipher text
32:06 - and so basically it takes plain text and
32:08 - just looks like scrambled text
32:10 - and so here's an example and this is way
32:12 - back in the day it kind of makes the
32:13 - illustration pretty clear but this was a
32:15 - a code book and it would store different
32:17 - cryptographic codes so if we were to
32:19 - zoom in here
32:20 - if you're given the code 0 2
32:24 - or 0 4
32:26 - it could mean uh this
32:28 - or i suppose like the word canoe could
32:31 - also mean has the authority so there's a
32:33 - bit of an encoding there uh or sorry
32:35 - like a cipher there to understand that
32:36 - translation so hopefully that makes it
32:38 - clear
32:42 - [Music]
32:43 - so to complete the puzzle for encryption
32:46 - you have a cipher and a key so a
32:48 - cryptographic key is a variable used in
32:49 - conjunction with an encryption algorithm
32:51 - in order to encrypt or decrypt data and
32:54 - so we have two uh types of keys we have
32:56 - symmetric keys and this is when you use
32:59 - the same key for encoding decoding so
33:01 - here is my key right
33:04 - i have my plain text i use that key it
33:07 - turns it into cipher text notice the
33:09 - text is not human readable and then i
33:11 - use the same key to turn it back into
33:13 - plain text and the most common uh
33:15 - symmetric encryption is aes and you'll
33:18 - definitely see that when working with
33:19 - azure aws or any cloud service provider
33:22 - then you have symmetric encryption or
33:24 - say asymmetric encryption this is when
33:26 - you use two keys one key to encode and
33:28 - one key to decode and so very similar
33:31 - process but the keys are separated uh
33:33 - the most popular case here is rsa okay
33:37 - [Music]
33:41 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
33:42 - we're looking at the concepts of hashing
33:44 - and salting so hashing is a function
33:46 - that accepts an arbitrary size of values
33:48 - and maps it to a fixed size data
33:50 - structure and hashing can reduce the
33:52 - size of the stored value now that is a
33:55 - benefit of hashing but that's not
33:56 - necessarily why we're using hashing so
33:59 - hashing is a one-way process meaning
34:00 - once you turn that text into a hash it's
34:03 - basically unreadable at that point and
34:05 - it's deterministic meaning that um it's
34:08 - a it it's a process where the input will
34:11 - always produce the same output so if you
34:13 - always give it john smith it's always
34:15 - going to produce o2 all right now the
34:18 - hash can be whatever it doesn't
34:19 - necessarily mean john smith will be o2
34:21 - it's just based on what the hashing
34:22 - function uh uh operates like how it
34:25 - works okay so the use case for hashing
34:27 - is for hashing passwords if you have a
34:30 - database you do not want them to reside
34:32 - in plain text because if a malicious
34:34 - actor gets in they can just see all the
34:35 - passwords so by hashing it
34:38 - it obscures what the password is now the
34:41 - way you would authenticate against the
34:42 - password because if a user inputs a
34:45 - password you have to match it against it
34:46 - you just have to hash the
34:50 - the inputted password and then match it
34:52 - against um the hash password right the
34:55 - hashed values and so popular hashing
34:57 - functions are md5 shot three 356
35:01 - b b crypt is pretty popular that's
35:03 - what everyone uses because it's very
35:04 - long and good uh if an attacker knows
35:07 - what what function you are using so if
35:09 - it knows uh the hashing function then
35:12 - that's an issue because
35:14 - you know they might not be able to see
35:15 - the password but they can enumerate
35:17 - against uh enumerate means like iterate
35:20 - through a bunch of passwords they have
35:21 - to determine what the password is so a
35:24 - preventative measure so they can't
35:26 - enumerate uh using a dictionary a
35:28 - password dictionary is to salt the
35:30 - password so a salt is a random string
35:32 - not known to the attacker that the hash
35:34 - function accepts to mitigate the
35:36 - deterministic nature of hashing
35:38 - functions okay so that is hashing
35:40 - insulting
35:41 - [Music]
35:46 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
35:47 - and we are looking at digital signatures
35:49 - and signings so what is a digital
35:51 - signature it's a mathematical scheme for
35:53 - verifying the authenticity of digital
35:55 - messages or documents and a digital
35:57 - signature gives us temper
36:00 - tamper evidence so imagine you had
36:03 - objects on your desk if you took
36:05 - something like baby powder which is a
36:06 - fine grain dust and spread it over your
36:08 - desk if someone were to move your items
36:10 - you would see
36:12 - clearly see that they have been moved
36:14 - because there'd be an outline between
36:15 - the powder and the area that had no
36:17 - powder underneath the objects and that's
36:19 - an example a real world example of
36:21 - tamper evidence so it's going to answer
36:24 - did someone mess or modify the data is
36:27 - this data not from the expected sender
36:29 - that's what these tamper evidence are
36:31 - telling us
36:32 - so
36:33 - there are three algorithms to digital
36:35 - signatures and so there is a visual
36:37 - example that i got from wikipedia i
36:39 - couldn't be bothered to make an image
36:40 - today but
36:42 - the idea is you have key generation so
36:43 - generates a public and private key so
36:45 - there are our two keys public and
36:47 - private
36:49 - and so we have the signing so this is
36:51 - the process of generating a digital
36:52 - signature with a private key and the
36:54 - inputted message so we have our private
36:57 - key and we have our inputted message and
36:59 - then you can see that it's attached to
37:01 - our message here
37:03 - you have signing verification
37:05 - so verify the authenticity of a message
37:07 - with a public key
37:08 - so when it's received by the other
37:10 - person we use the public key to
37:12 - determine that it is from the person we
37:14 - think that it's from and it hasn't been
37:15 - tampered with so a very famous example
37:18 - of this would be ssh
37:20 - so this is used for logging into remote
37:22 - virtual machines and we use a public and
37:24 - private key to authorize remote access
37:26 - to that machine uh and what you do is
37:29 - you'd probably use the ssh keygen
37:31 - command this is a very well-known
37:32 - command and i haven't memorized because
37:35 - i i've used it so many times and so will
37:37 - you
37:37 - and notice that it has a hyphen t so it
37:39 - says that we want to take rsa as the
37:41 - input that is the type of algorithm that
37:43 - we are using um to generate out uh that
37:47 - okay and remember earlier on when we
37:49 - were talking about asymmetric keys where
37:51 - there was two keys and we mentioned rsa
37:53 - that's the same key here okay
37:55 - one other thing i want to mention is
37:56 - code signing just because when you hear
37:58 - signing you might see code signing what
37:59 - the difference is this is just when you
38:01 - use a digital signature to ensure
38:02 - computer code has not been tampered with
38:05 - all right so if you have a repository uh
38:07 - you know people might try to inject bad
38:09 - code into your repo and this is one way
38:12 - to prevent it okay
38:13 - [Music]
38:17 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
38:19 - and we are comparing in transit versus
38:22 - at rest encryption so encryption and
38:24 - transit is data that is secure when
38:26 - moving between locations and our
38:28 - algorithms that we'll see here is tls
38:30 - and ssl for encryption at rest this is
38:33 - data that's secure when residing on
38:35 - storage or within a database and so
38:37 - algorithms here could be used would be
38:39 - aes or ras all right we've covered aes
38:43 - and res but let's talk about
38:46 - tls and ssl so tls which stands for
38:49 - transport layer security is an
38:51 - encryption protocol for data integrity
38:53 - between two or more communicating
38:54 - computer applications tls is deprecated
38:58 - in favor of ssl that means that we don't
39:00 - use it anymore but every time you know
39:03 - we mention encryption transit or ssl
39:05 - everyone always mentions tls where ssl
39:08 - originates from so even though we don't
39:09 - use it you just see everyone always
39:11 - mentioning it so ssl stands for secure
39:13 - socket layers and it's an encryption
39:15 - protocol for data integrity between two
39:17 - or more communicating computer
39:18 - applications how it's different from tls
39:21 - i can't remember myself but i just want
39:23 - you to know that ssl is the one that is
39:25 - used today so when you connect to a
39:27 - website you see https that is using ssl
39:31 - [Music]
39:35 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
39:37 - and we're looking at multi-factor
39:38 - authentication also known as mfa and
39:40 - that's how i'll refer to it through the
39:42 - entire course
39:43 - and it's a security control where after
39:45 - you fill in your email and password you
39:47 - have to use a second device such as a
39:49 - phone to confirm that it's you that is
39:52 - logging in so mfa protects against
39:53 - people who have stolen your password mfa
39:56 - is an option in most cloud providers and
39:58 - even social media websites such as
40:00 - facebook so here it is example you see
40:02 - my email my password and that is called
40:06 - one factor so i've confirmed my identity
40:08 - like uh in this one case and then you
40:10 - have the second factor also known as
40:13 - multi-factor that's usually what we call
40:14 - it and then that's going to let us get
40:16 - into the system okay
40:18 - [Music]
40:22 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
40:24 - and we are looking at security
40:25 - information event management
40:27 - s-i-e-m so to understand this we're just
40:30 - going to define a couple things so what
40:31 - is log management well this focuses on
40:33 - simple collection and storage of log
40:36 - messages and audit trails then you have
40:39 - event logs so system and applications
40:41 - generate events which are kept in event
40:43 - logs list of activities that occurred
40:45 - with records of new events being
40:47 - appended to the end of the logs as they
40:49 - occur
40:51 - so when we say what is a security
40:53 - information management sim this is the
40:55 - long-term storage as well as analysis
40:58 - and reporting of log data
41:00 - then you have an sem so this is for
41:02 - security event management so real-time
41:05 - monitoring correlation events and
41:06 - notifications of consoles
41:08 - notice here
41:10 - logs
41:11 - logs events
41:13 - events okay so there's a correlation
41:15 - between these two definitions for you
41:18 - so what is security information event
41:20 - management well it's simply the
41:21 - combination of a sim and a sem to
41:24 - provide real-time analysis of security
41:26 - alerts generated by the network hardware
41:29 - and applications so here we have our
41:31 - s-i-e-m
41:33 - and we would have features like log
41:35 - collection log analysis uh event
41:37 - correlation log forensic it compliance
41:40 - application log monitoring
41:42 - object access auditing real-time
41:44 - alerting user activity monitoring
41:46 - dashboards reporting file integrity
41:48 - monitoring system and device monitoring
41:51 - or log monitoring and log retention so
41:54 - you can see that this tool does a lot
41:57 - and it's very important in your security
41:59 - tool belt
42:04 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
42:06 - and we are looking at security
42:07 - orchestration and automated response
42:09 - also known as soar and this collects
42:10 - data about security threats and responds
42:12 - to security events without human
42:13 - assistance so the source system will
42:16 - trigger action driven automated
42:17 - workflows these are called playbooks and
42:20 - processes uh the process to run security
42:22 - tasks that mitigate the issue so for
42:24 - security orchestration there's two
42:26 - components here security orchestration
42:28 - and automated response so for security
42:30 - orchestration it connects various
42:32 - internal or external security tools via
42:34 - built-in or custom integration so
42:35 - possible connectors and this is not an
42:37 - exhaustive list but vulnerability
42:39 - scanners endpoint protection and user
42:41 - behavior analytics firewalls intrusion
42:43 - detection protection systems
42:46 - security information and event
42:48 - management so ciem
42:50 - threat intelligence feeds so for the
42:52 - security automation side it analyzes the
42:55 - injected data to create playbooks so
42:57 - these are repeatable automated processes
42:59 - to replace manual processes it'll be
43:01 - replacing things like vulnerability
43:02 - scanning log analysis ticket checking
43:05 - auditing and a sort can use ai and ml to
43:08 - provide recommendations and further
43:10 - automate responses
43:12 - [Music]
43:16 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
43:18 - and we're looking at extended detection
43:19 - response of xdr and so this is a
43:21 - cross-layer detection and response
43:23 - security system and xdr uses a holistic
43:26 - approach detect and respond to threats
43:27 - that would normally evade detection in a
43:29 - single vector solution by collaborating
43:32 - multiple data sources into a
43:33 - multi-vector solution so here is our xcr
43:36 - and what we need is a data lake to store
43:38 - these various data so we get network
43:40 - data fire email endpoints cloud
43:43 - workloads and the xtr is going to allow
43:45 - us to do things like automated detection
43:46 - sweeping hunting
43:48 - root cause analysis and we can use that
43:51 - with our siem or soar so this can be
43:53 - used to uh to augment uh these other
43:56 - solutions here okay
43:58 - [Music]
44:02 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
44:04 - and we're looking at endpoint detection
44:06 - in response to edr and this combines
44:08 - real-time continuous monitoring and
44:09 - collection of endpoint data with rules
44:12 - based on automated response and analysis
44:14 - capabilities i'm sure explained
44:16 - somewhere else in the course but an end
44:17 - point is an entry uh is an entry or gate
44:20 - on your security perimeter it's a way to
44:22 - enter the network okay and so ed
44:25 - edps are designed to detect apt so what
44:29 - is an apt it stands for advanced
44:31 - persistent threat and the idea here is
44:33 - that these threats will breach a
44:35 - security perimeter so through an
44:36 - endpoint
44:37 - and take up residence within a network
44:39 - to steal as much data as it can over a
44:41 - long period of time apts are threat
44:43 - actors so they're not software they're
44:44 - actually people behind them that
44:46 - engineer specific malware uh engineered
44:48 - for a particular target apts are slow
44:52 - acting and stealthy and common targets
44:55 - for apts are tier one manufacturers
44:57 - defense contractors government agencies
44:59 - so how an ed edr is going to help you is
45:03 - it's going to do detection so behavioral
45:04 - analysis advanced uh detection
45:06 - techniques ioc scans for response it has
45:09 - automated response on discovery quick
45:12 - response during the investigation
45:13 - multiple response options and for
45:15 - investigation it has it has root cause
45:17 - attack visualizations uh enriched attack
45:20 - data very similar it seems very similar
45:22 - to an xdr but the edrs are focused all
45:26 - around endpoints and xdrs are a lot more
45:28 - broader so um you know edr's just do a
45:31 - better job with endpoints okay but you
45:33 - can use both
45:34 - [Music]
45:39 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
45:40 - and we are looking at cloud access
45:42 - security brokers also known as casb and
45:45 - this system sits between the cloud user
45:47 - and the cloud application and monitors
45:49 - all activity enforces security policies
45:51 - so on the left hand side you'd have your
45:53 - remote workforce maybe they're working
45:55 - from home maybe they're on the job like
45:57 - at a a remote location then you have
46:00 - your corporate office so this is where
46:02 - everyone would be in a very controlled
46:04 - environment but all that traffic is
46:05 - going to pass through the casb and the
46:07 - idea here is you'll get control of
46:08 - monitoring compliance management data
46:10 - security and threat protection for your
46:11 - cloud services whether it's software as
46:13 - a service platform as a service or
46:15 - infrastructure as a service so some of
46:17 - the features to help you think about
46:18 - what csb can do for you uh is it has
46:22 - monitoring user activity warning
46:23 - administrators about potential hazardous
46:25 - actions enforcing security policy
46:26 - compliance automatically preventing
46:28 - malware restricts unauthorized access
46:30 - identify account takeovers uncovers
46:33 - shadow
46:34 - cloud i.t
46:37 - or just shadow i.t is an easy way to say
46:38 - it cloud data loss prevention
46:41 - internal external data access controls
46:44 - records an audit trail of risky behavior
46:47 - cloud phishing malware threats and
46:49 - continuous monitoring of new cloud
46:50 - threats now i would say that if i had to
46:52 - highlight any of them out of here and i
46:53 - really should have put this in red here
46:55 - is i would say uncover shadow i t and if
46:57 - that doesn't make sense don't worry we
46:59 - explain it later
47:00 - [Music]
47:04 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
47:06 - and we are exploring the concept of
47:08 - security posture and in order to do that
47:10 - we're just going to have to set up some
47:11 - additional terms here this one is very
47:13 - term loaded so get ready for this
47:15 - the first one here is malicious actors
47:17 - also known as threat actors or attackers
47:19 - i like to call them malicious actors it
47:21 - is a person machine or entity of an
47:23 - event or incident that impacts or has
47:26 - the potential to impact the safety or
47:28 - security of another entity this is the
47:30 - bad person okay
47:32 - inventory so up-to-date lists of uh
47:34 - assets software and hardware for your
47:36 - organization
47:37 - that can be accompanied with additional
47:39 - metadata
47:40 - there's a different kinds of assets in
47:42 - our inventory so we have perimeter
47:44 - assets assets exposed to the internet so
47:46 - public facing core assets assets within
47:48 - your private network private facing when
47:52 - we say attack vector this is the method
47:54 - of a malicious attack uses that they use
47:56 - to breach or infiltrate a network they
47:59 - could target infrastructure or a human
48:01 - for weakness and a lot of the cases
48:03 - we're seeing more human engineered
48:06 - attack vectors than going directly for
48:08 - infrastructure
48:09 - the attack surface is the sum of the
48:11 - attack factors the larger the inventory
48:14 - generally increases the amount of attack
48:16 - vectors the larger the attack surface
48:18 - the more difficult it is to mitigate
48:20 - attacks then you have security controls
48:22 - you'll hear this word security controls
48:24 - over and over again in this course
48:26 - controls are safeguards or counter
48:28 - measures to avoid detect counteract or
48:30 - minimize security risks and then we can
48:32 - answer what a security posture is so a
48:34 - formula to determine the overall
48:36 - effectiveness of a company's security
48:39 - overall defense
48:40 - we're talking about azure
48:42 - they call it a security score and it's
48:44 - basically a number and then you can go
48:46 - drill down and look at the security
48:47 - controls and the
48:49 - security controls can map out to your
48:50 - inventory so this is how you kind of see
48:52 - they're all tied together if we wanted
48:54 - to kind of describe how you would
48:55 - evaluate or assess the security posture
48:57 - uh here i got a little quick list here
48:59 - so we collect information by asking
49:01 - common questions so it could be what
49:03 - data do we collect how and where are we
49:05 - storing this data how do we protect uh
49:08 - we protect and document the data how
49:09 - long do we keep the data who has access
49:11 - to the internally external data is the
49:13 - place we are storing the data properly
49:15 - secured wipe that out there that's a bit
49:17 - of a mess um security ratings aka
49:20 - security scores so data driven objective
49:22 - and dynamic measurements of an
49:24 - organization security posture created by
49:26 - a trusted independent security rating
49:28 - platform so that is security posture and
49:31 - we'll definitely see it mentioned about
49:32 - like three times in this course okay
49:34 - [Music]
49:38 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
49:40 - and we're looking at cloud security
49:42 - posture management also known as cspm
49:44 - and this identifies and remediates risks
49:46 - through security assessments and
49:48 - automated compliance and monitoring to
49:49 - give a kind of a visual for what this
49:51 - thing does so you have the cspm in the
49:53 - middle around it you got automation life
49:55 - cycle governance and brokerage and
49:58 - extending that a little bit further you
49:59 - got provisioning orchestration cost
50:01 - management resource optimization cloud
50:04 - migration backup disaster recovery
50:06 - identity security compliance uh
50:08 - packaging and delivery monitoring
50:10 - analytics inventory and classification
50:13 - and
50:14 - service requests so to reiterate you
50:17 - know a cspm assesses your system it
50:20 - automatically alerts security staff in
50:21 - your it departments when a vulnerability
50:23 - is found and so some security tools we
50:26 - can expect to see in here is zero trust
50:27 - based access controls real-time risk
50:30 - scoring threat and vulnerability
50:31 - management that is a very uh very useful
50:34 - cases of the tvms discover uh sharing
50:37 - risks technical policy threat modeling
50:39 - system and architecture teams that would
50:41 - use a ces pm would be your threat
50:43 - intelligence team your information
50:45 - technology your compliance and risk
50:47 - management teams your business leaders
50:49 - your smes
50:51 - uh your security architecture and
50:52 - operations and your audit team okay
50:55 - [Music]
51:00 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
51:01 - we're looking at just in time and just
51:03 - enough privileges these two terms come
51:05 - up a lot in microsoft and azure
51:08 - documentation but they don't fully
51:09 - explain them to you so i'm taking the
51:11 - time up front here so that you know it
51:13 - when you see the initialism so
51:15 - just in time also known as jit is giving
51:18 - access to resources only during the time
51:20 - when needed reducing the surface attack
51:23 - uh based on the range of time access so
51:25 - someone only needs something for two
51:26 - minutes uh give it to them and take it
51:28 - away right so and and give them access
51:31 - to things near the time that they need
51:32 - it so if they're not gonna use it from
51:34 - an hour from now don't give them give it
51:36 - to them so there's an hour window give
51:38 - it to them exactly when they're using it
51:39 - and when they're and take it away when
51:40 - they exactly aren't using it then you
51:43 - have just enough privilege so
51:45 - known as jep so giving access to only
51:48 - the specific actions reducing the
51:49 - surface attack by providing the least
51:51 - privileged principles this is pretty
51:53 - much uh the principle of least privilege
51:56 - which is another initialism i'm sure
51:57 - we'll see in the course but for some
51:58 - reason they call it this here but these
52:00 - are the two things you'll see throughout
52:02 - microsoft and azure documentation
52:04 - [Music]
52:08 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
52:10 - we're looking at ingress egress so very
52:13 - outdated but very clear graphic of how
52:15 - these two things work so ingress is
52:16 - traffic that's entering a network
52:19 - boundary and anger or egress is traffic
52:22 - exiting a network boundary and you're if
52:24 - you're wondering where these terms came
52:25 - from they're latin so ingressus and i
52:28 - don't i don't speak latin so i'm not
52:29 - pronouncing it properly and there's some
52:31 - variations on how to pronounce latin so
52:33 - who knows but ingress would mean to
52:35 - advance walk walking or an entry whereas
52:38 - egress is the opposite is it's to leave
52:41 - okay
52:42 - [Music]
52:46 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
52:48 - we're looking at the concept of shadow
52:49 - i.t which is a business agility process
52:52 - where departments can purchase and
52:54 - provision their own i.t resources
52:56 - without the approval of the
52:57 - organization's centralized i.t
52:59 - department so the advantage of shadow
53:02 - i.t systems allows organization to
53:04 - innovate and quickly prototype future
53:05 - solutions but the disadvantage of shadow
53:08 - i.t systems increase risk with
53:10 - organizational requirements for security
53:12 - controls compatibility with compliance
53:14 - programs loss of data or unexpected data
53:16 - exposure documentation reliability so uh
53:20 - you know you get great agility but then
53:22 - you need additional security services
53:24 - which we talked about earlier to make
53:26 - sure that there's no abuse of these
53:28 - shadow it systems
53:29 - [Music]
53:33 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
53:35 - we're looking at automation
53:37 - investigation and remediation so
53:39 - investigation is when you're gathering
53:41 - evidence from a digital system to
53:42 - uncover malicious intent or reduction in
53:44 - a security posture remediation is the
53:47 - action of remedying a as something to
53:50 - prevent or revert a disaster the act of
53:52 - changing a resource back to the desired
53:54 - state or state that does not cause a
53:56 - problem so in the context of cloud
53:58 - security a cloud resource is being
54:00 - remediated to stay compliant with our
54:02 - expected security controls so prevention
54:04 - would be something like turning the
54:06 - virtual machine off if the port 22 was
54:08 - exposed
54:09 - reverting would be turning back on
54:11 - encryption if a
54:12 - disk encryption is disabled so to revert
54:15 - so to put it back in the previous state
54:17 - so for the systems here we have
54:19 - automated investigation this is a
54:21 - service that uses an inspection
54:23 - algorithm that triggers an alert which
54:24 - in turn creates an incident
54:27 - and then we have automated remediation a
54:29 - service which watches for types of
54:30 - incidents
54:31 - uh incidents and matches it with a
54:34 - remediation action so it could be
54:35 - something like shutting off a server and
54:37 - so air so it's just the combination of
54:40 - these two systems so automated
54:42 - investigation and automated remediation
54:44 - okay
54:44 - [Music]
54:49 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
54:50 - and we're looking at threat analysis and
54:52 - this is the practice of mitigating
54:54 - possible threats via threat modeling and
54:56 - threat modeling is a structured process
54:58 - for identifying attackers and cataloging
55:00 - past possible threats and so there's a
55:02 - lot of different methodologies for this
55:05 - and some to point out would be stride
55:07 - which is developed by microsoft uh pasta
55:10 - or pasta yeah i think that's how you'd
55:11 - say it process of attack simulation and
55:14 - threat analysis it's a seven uh seven
55:16 - step risk-centric methodology you have
55:18 - trike which is an open source threat
55:20 - modeling process mal which stands for
55:22 - mel meta attack language a domain
55:24 - specific language used for
55:26 - threat modeling and attack simulations
55:28 - uh and so you know that's that but we'll
55:30 - look at more detail here at stride okay
55:36 - [Music]
55:37 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
55:39 - and we are looking at the stride
55:41 - methodology and so stride is for threat
55:43 - modeling as we just mentioned a moment
55:45 - ago and it can categorize different
55:47 - threats into the following so the first
55:49 - is spoofing so illegally accessing and
55:52 - then using another user's authentication
55:54 - information tampering some malicious
55:56 - modification of data
55:57 - repudiation so illegal operation in a
56:01 - system that lacks ability to trace the
56:03 - prohibited operation
56:05 - information disclosure so exposure of
56:07 - information to individuals who are not
56:09 - exposed to have access to it denial of
56:12 - service deny service to valid users and
56:16 - elevation of privileges unprivileged uh
56:18 - users gain
56:19 - privileged access so if you notice that
56:22 - spells stride
56:24 - all right so if we wanted to use stride
56:26 - we have the microsoft security
56:28 - development life cycle
56:29 - and it provides a tool to assist with
56:31 - this process and i believe they call it
56:33 - the microsoft threat modeling tool and
56:34 - it makes threat modeling easier for all
56:36 - developers through a standard notation
56:38 - for visualizing system components data
56:40 - flows and security boundaries
56:45 - [Music]
56:47 - all right so i wanted to actually show
56:48 - off the microsoft threat modeling tool
56:50 - so you get an idea what it can do so i
56:52 - typed in microsoft threat modeling tool
56:53 - and on the left hand side here there's a
56:55 - bunch of releases i actually didn't
56:56 - choose the latest one which i probably
56:58 - should have but if you scroll on down
56:59 - you'll see this thing that says
57:00 - microsoft threat modeling tool and i've
57:02 - opened it up and it looks like this
57:04 - and so they have an example model if we
57:06 - open it up we can see what we have here
57:08 - so basically it's a stenciling tool of
57:10 - generic things and so
57:12 - i mean you don't have to use this you
57:14 - could use something like lucidcharts or
57:16 - something else to do threat modeling but
57:18 - it's nice that this is a free program
57:20 - and it literally was like four megabytes
57:22 - to install if we wanted to see kind of
57:24 - an example that is more particular to
57:26 - azure
57:27 - we have threat model templates here and
57:29 - so um
57:31 - you can see that there are stencils for
57:33 - these particular resources so i guess
57:35 - the idea is that you know we might not
57:37 - have those stencils those azure stencils
57:39 - and so this one i guess adds it to the
57:41 - service so if we expand here we can see
57:43 - some threat modeling for um
57:46 - azure
57:47 - and so
57:48 - you know you have your your boundaries
57:50 - for your corporate net
57:52 - and then if we scroll on over
57:54 - we have our azure trust boundary and
57:56 - then our resource group trust boundary
57:58 - and you can see kind of where
57:59 - information flows between different
58:01 - services so like azure events data
58:04 - factory things like that so you know
58:06 - hopefully that gives you a visual idea
58:07 - what um threat modeling is uh but there
58:10 - you go
58:11 - [Music]
58:15 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
58:17 - and we're looking at intrusion detection
58:18 - and protection and so we have two
58:20 - systems here rolled into one so the
58:22 - first is ids intrusion detection system
58:24 - it monitors a network or system for
58:26 - malicious activity or policy violations
58:29 - and the idea is that uh once it detects
58:31 - something it's going to create an
58:32 - incident and so that you can go through
58:34 - an itemized list to take action then you
58:37 - have an ips so intrusion protection
58:39 - system this restricts or reacts
58:41 - to the the detected malicious activity
58:44 - taking action doing something about it
58:46 - if you roll these two into one you get
58:48 - an ids ips and this is how they are
58:51 - often
58:53 - offered in the market you're really
58:55 - going to see these things separated out
58:56 - as separate offerings okay
58:58 - if you're figuring out okay well how
59:00 - does an ids actually detect
59:02 - incidences it has three ways of doing it
59:04 - the first is signature-based detection
59:06 - this is a simple technique where it uses
59:08 - a signature
59:09 - and a signature is a set of rules that
59:11 - an ids and an ips
59:13 - uses detect typical intrusion activity
59:16 - it compares signatures against observed
59:18 - events to identify possible incidents
59:20 - then you have anomaly-based detection
59:22 - this is a more advanced technique and so
59:25 - it compares definitions of what is
59:26 - considered normal activity with observed
59:28 - events in order to identify
59:30 - significant deviations then you have
59:32 - stateful protocol analysis this is a
59:34 - profile technique
59:36 - it compares to predetermined profiles or
59:38 - generally accepted definitions of benign
59:40 - protocol activity for each protocol
59:42 - state against observed events in order
59:45 - to identify deviations no matter which
59:47 - one you're using whatever your provider
59:49 - is you want to turn this stuff on
59:52 - immediately because an ips ids is only
59:55 - useful if you have a baseline a
59:57 - a look at what normal activity looks
60:00 - like within your network so you cannot
60:02 - turn this stuff on late in the game you
60:04 - got to turn it on on day one okay
60:06 - [Music]
60:10 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
60:12 - we're looking at the mitre attack
60:14 - framework so first of all what is mitre
60:16 - it is a not-for-profit organization
60:18 - supporting various us government
60:20 - agencies in the aviation defense
60:21 - healthcare homeland security and cyber
60:24 - security fields and then we have the
60:26 - mitre attack framework and this is a
60:28 - globally accessible knowledge base of
60:30 - adversary tactics and techniques based
60:32 - on real-world observations look down
60:34 - below you can see there's a lot of stuff
60:35 - in here
60:37 - if you're thinking about this knowledge
60:39 - base you might say well what is the
60:40 - purpose of it but it's used as a
60:41 - foundation for the development of
60:43 - specific threat models
60:45 - and methodologies in the private sector
60:48 - government and cyber security product
60:49 - and service community it has a website
60:51 - it's easy to view you just go to
60:53 - attack.miter.org
60:54 - and i think it's really great because if
60:56 - you
60:57 - look around it gives you kind of an idea
60:58 - of things that you have to be thinking
61:00 - about okay
61:01 - [Music]
61:05 - okay so i wanted to get you some
61:06 - exposure to the attack.miter.org just
61:08 - because i know you saw a screenshot but
61:10 - always helps to take a quicker look here
61:12 - if we scroll on down below we have
61:14 - categories across the top that are
61:15 - interested so maybe you're interested in
61:17 - privileged escalation but you know we
61:19 - can drill down here and say okay well
61:20 - what in particular are we interested in
61:23 - so let's say we want to look at
61:25 - exploitation of privileged
61:27 - escalation they have a full description
61:29 - on here and procedure examples of things
61:33 - that you can do so there is a lot of
61:34 - stuff in here okay so uh you know if
61:37 - you're wondering
61:39 - uh what it is that you need to do oh it
61:41 - just keeps on going you really drill
61:43 - down here and and read a lot of stuff
61:45 - but this really really does help you get
61:47 - a a full idea of the type of attacks
61:49 - that can happen on your system so
61:51 - definitely if you have more time check
61:53 - it out
61:53 - [Music]
61:57 - hey this is angie brown from exam pro
61:59 - we're going to look at the six microsoft
62:02 - privacy principles so the first being
62:03 - control which is we will put you in
62:06 - control of your privacy with ease-of-use
62:08 - tools and clear choices second being
62:10 - transparency we'll be transparent about
62:12 - the data collection and
62:14 - and we use so you can make informed
62:16 - decisions number three we will protect
62:19 - the data you entrust uh to us through
62:21 - strong security encryption number four
62:24 - strong legal protection so we will
62:26 - respect your local privacy laws and
62:28 - fight for legal protection for your
62:29 - privacy as a fundamental human right
62:31 - number five no content based targeting
62:34 - so we will not use your email chat files
62:36 - or personal uh content to target ads
62:38 - that you
62:39 - uh have a hard time believing that fifth
62:40 - one but hey they say they don't do it
62:42 - number six benefits to you so we will
62:45 - uh when we do collect data we will use
62:47 - it to benefit you and make sure your
62:49 - experiences
62:51 - to make your experiences better so it's
62:53 - kind of funny because like it seems like
62:54 - number six could contradict number five
62:56 - but you know if they saw it as a benefit
62:58 - to you but yeah that's the microsoft
63:00 - privacy principle
63:05 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
63:07 - we're looking at microsoft privacy not
63:09 - to be confused with microsoft privacy
63:11 - principles
63:12 - and the reason why there's privacy again
63:15 - here it's just because microsoft is a
63:17 - big organization and sometimes they have
63:19 - marketing efforts that overlap or
63:21 - conflict and it gets kind of confusing
63:23 - which is which
63:25 - and that's just microsoft being
63:26 - microsoft for you but we're going to go
63:28 - through it anyway because
63:29 - regardless of which one is more
63:31 - important i think it's just good to get
63:32 - good coverage here and it's explained in
63:34 - a slightly different way so helps you
63:36 - understand how these providers think uh
63:39 - you know about your data so starting at
63:41 - the top here we have control your data
63:42 - so you your data belongs to you you can
63:44 - access modify or delete it at any time
63:47 - you're in control of your data it's
63:49 - reinforced by microsoft compliance so
63:51 - gdpr iso 2718
63:54 - they have independent audit reports
63:57 - data processing only with consent
64:00 - neither shared or mined for market
64:02 - research and advertising subcon
64:04 - subcontractors data restrictions so aka
64:06 - sub processors can perform only the
64:09 - function that microsoft has hired them
64:10 - to provide and they are bound by the
64:12 - same contractual privacy commitments
64:14 - that microsoft makes to you for
64:15 - controlled data location you choose
64:18 - where your data is located so choice of
64:20 - data center data residency residency
64:22 - meaning like the boundaries of a country
64:25 - or a geographic boundary
64:27 - we're talking about securing your data
64:28 - so data at rest they use a aes 256
64:32 - encryption dating transit ssl and tls
64:35 - encryption keys you have azure key vault
64:38 - for defending your data responding to
64:39 - data requests they will not disclose
64:41 - data to a government or a law
64:43 - enforcement
64:44 - agency unless required by law
64:47 - law enforcement requests so direct the
64:49 - requesting party to seek the data
64:50 - directly from the customer so they're
64:52 - not doing it uh on your behalf okay uh
64:55 - our they have contact contractual
64:58 - commitments so using the courts to
65:00 - challenge governments demands that are
65:02 - inconsistent with the rule of law so
65:03 - they're always fighting on your side
65:05 - they have gdr compliance so disclose
65:08 - their data in response to a government
65:10 - request in violation of uh eu's gdpr
65:14 - disclose their data in response so gdpr
65:16 - compliance that could have been worded
65:18 - better i'm taking it from their content
65:19 - by the way but gdpr is is like if you're
65:22 - a european citizen you can say hey i
65:24 - don't want you to hold on to my data so
65:26 - show me what you have
65:27 - about me and also can you uh delete it
65:30 - okay and that's what that is there
65:36 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
65:39 - and we're looking at primary security
65:40 - perimeter this is a super important
65:42 - concept and has a lot to do with
65:44 - identity and azure id so pay close
65:46 - attention here so what is security
65:48 - perimeter so barriers are built
65:50 - fortifications to either keep intruders
65:52 - out or to keep captives contained within
65:54 - the area the boundary surrounds so when
65:56 - we're talking about a data center we're
65:58 - talking about the physical fence as the
66:00 - security perimeter that's just one
66:01 - mechanism of security perimeter
66:03 - for cloud network we're talking about
66:05 - protocol software hardware as the
66:07 - security perimeter
66:08 - so what is an entry point this is the
66:10 - point of entry to cross a security
66:12 - perimeter
66:13 - and then we have access controls and
66:14 - these are the security mechanisms at the
66:16 - point of access that allow or denies
66:19 - access when we're talking about
66:20 - permission
66:22 - to access a resource this is called
66:23 - authorization
66:25 - and so what is a primary security
66:27 - perimeter so traditional security
66:29 - focused on firewalls vpn since there
66:32 - were fewer employees or workstations
66:34 - outside the office but now that we have
66:36 - bring your own devices remote
66:38 - workstations it is much more common now
66:41 - to access controls via a zero trust
66:43 - model i really should have highlighted
66:45 - that in yellow or red like that support
66:47 - very important and uh
66:49 - zero trust models are being adopted so
66:51 - we see mfa and we see a shift towards
66:53 - user identity management becoming the
66:55 - primary security primary perimeter for
66:58 - security so the primary security
67:00 - perimeter is user identity management
67:02 - and so when we're talking about azure
67:04 - it's going to be azure active directory
67:06 - because this is the most common tool
67:07 - okay
67:09 - [Music]
67:13 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
67:15 - we're taking a look here at ipd's so
67:18 - identity providers is a system entity
67:20 - that creates uh maintains and manages
67:22 - identity for information four principles
67:24 - and also provides authentication
67:26 - services to applications within a
67:27 - federation or distributed network a
67:30 - trusted provider or of uh your user
67:32 - identity that lets you use
67:33 - authentication to access other services
67:36 - is another way to put it so an ipd could
67:38 - be something like facebook amazon google
67:39 - twitter github linkedin if you've ever
67:42 - used
67:43 - some service that said log in with your
67:44 - facebook account or google account
67:46 - that's what an ipd is so federated
67:48 - identity is a method of linking a user's
67:51 - identity across multiple separate
67:53 - identity management systems so a
67:55 - federation is just a collection of
67:57 - identities
67:58 - uh we have a few different technologies
68:00 - that are involved with ipds so the first
68:02 - is open id this is an open standard and
68:05 - decentralized authentication protocol so
68:07 - this allows you to log in with different
68:08 - social media platforms
68:10 - such as google or facebook open id is
68:12 - about providing who you are
68:15 - auth 2.0 or oauth 2.0 is an industry
68:18 - standard protocol for authorization of
68:20 - oauth doesn't share your password data
68:22 - but instead uses authorization tokens to
68:24 - prove an identity between the consumer
68:25 - and service provider and so oauth is
68:28 - about granting access to functionality
68:30 - so you can use open id and oauth 2.0
68:32 - together the last is saml security
68:35 - assertion mark markup language it's an
68:37 - open standard for exchanging
68:38 - authentication authorization between
68:40 - identity providers and service provider
68:42 - uh it's a use case for saml which is
68:44 - single sign-on with web browser whenever
68:46 - using azure id and you want to connect a
68:48 - web app you're going to be looking at
68:49 - using saml okay
68:53 - [Music]
68:55 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
68:57 - and this is our introduction into azu of
68:59 - active directory also known as azure ad
69:01 - and it's microsoft's cloud-based
69:03 - identity and access management service
69:05 - which helps your employees sign in and
69:07 - access resources it's going to help us
69:09 - both externally and with internal
69:10 - resources so on the external side we're
69:12 - looking at microsoft 365 the azure
69:15 - portal sas applications and for internal
69:17 - resources so those are apps that reside
69:19 - within your internal network uh access
69:21 - to workstations uh that may reside on
69:24 - premise uh and one of the best features
69:27 - of azure ad is single sign-on that's
69:29 - what a lot of companies want it for uh
69:31 - in terms of uh the types of azure active
69:33 - directory there are it's broken down to
69:35 - four editions with each uh
69:38 - subsequent tier having all the features
69:40 - of the previous tier and so we have the
69:42 - free tier where you get multi-factor
69:44 - authentication single sign-on basic
69:46 - security usage reports user management
69:48 - you have office 365 apps so that will
69:51 - give you company branding sla to sync
69:53 - between on-premise and cloud and the
69:56 - last two which i want you to notice and
69:59 - take note of because we do mention a lot
70:01 - of the features in this course for these
70:02 - two tiers it's premium one and premium
70:04 - two als commonly abbreviated to p1 and
70:07 - p2 so you have hybrid architecture
70:09 - advanced group access conditional access
70:11 - and for premium two you have identity
70:13 - protection identity governance so again
70:17 - as we move up the tier each of the
70:19 - previous tier has all the features of
70:21 - the prior one so premium one has uh or
70:24 - so premium two has all the features of
70:26 - premium one
70:27 - in terms of uh the use case for azure id
70:30 - it's for uh authorizing and
70:32 - authenticating to multiple sources so
70:34 - whether it's on-premise your active
70:36 - directory to your web app uh to allow
70:39 - for
70:40 - identity like using identity providers
70:42 - or to connect to microsoft 365 or
70:44 - microsoft azure azure id takes care of
70:47 - all this stuff and so when we're looking
70:49 - at hybrid connections we're talking
70:50 - about azure ad connect when we're
70:52 - looking at integrating our applications
70:54 - that is through
70:56 - app registrations where we have uh the
70:58 - b2c service and we'll talk about that in
71:01 - greater detail then you have external
71:03 - identities so that's going to be for
71:04 - your ipds uh and then you can also uh
71:07 - easily integrate with cloud applications
71:09 - there's no particular service like sub
71:11 - service for that it's just azure id
71:12 - naturally does that okay
71:15 - [Music]
71:19 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
71:21 - and we are comparing active directory
71:23 - versus azure active directory because
71:25 - they're not the same thing so active
71:27 - directory has been around for quite a
71:28 - long time it's been around since windows
71:31 - 2000
71:32 - and it was first introduced as active
71:34 - directory
71:35 - domain services to give organizations
71:37 - the ability to manage multiple
71:39 - on-premise infrastructure components and
71:40 - systems using a single identity per user
71:43 - and so azure ad takes this approach to
71:46 - the next level by providing
71:47 - organizations with an identity as a
71:49 - service so an ida solution for their
71:52 - apps across cloud and on-premise so both
71:55 - are still used today so there's active
71:58 - directory which is used for on-premise
72:00 - and there's azure ad which is the cloud
72:02 - version
72:03 - and so we see a lot of companies might
72:05 - want to migrate over to azure id or they
72:07 - might have a particular
72:09 - legacy licensing that makes it more cost
72:11 - effective or there might be certain
72:13 - security compliances where that's why
72:15 - they're not using azure id so both of
72:17 - these are still valid products just
72:18 - different use cases okay
72:24 - let's take a closer look here at azure
72:26 - ad for app registration so app
72:28 - registrations allow developers to
72:30 - integrate web applications to use azure
72:32 - id to authenticate users and request
72:34 - access to user resources such as email
72:37 - calendar and documents and this allows
72:39 - you to implement single sign-on into
72:41 - your web applications the way you access
72:43 - it is you just go to your azure id and
72:44 - there's a section under there called app
72:46 - registrations we're definitely going to
72:48 - cover a little bit more about app
72:50 - registrations when we talk about azure
72:52 - 80
72:53 - b2c because that is the actual way of uh
72:56 - doing authentication and we'll cover
72:57 - more about app registration there but
72:59 - just a quick introduction here okay
73:04 - [Music]
73:06 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
73:08 - we're taking a look here at azure id
73:09 - external identities and the idea here is
73:12 - that it allows people outside your
73:13 - organization to access your apps and
73:15 - resources while letting them sign in
73:17 - using whatever identity they prefer so
73:19 - whether it's your partners distributors
73:21 - suppliers vendors or other guest users
73:23 - you can bring your own identities so it
73:25 - supports logins like google and facebook
73:27 - there's so many more and i'll show you
73:28 - in a moment but the idea here is you can
73:30 - share your apps with external users
73:32 - develop apps intended for azure ad
73:34 - tenants develop white label apps for
73:36 - consumers and customers and there's two
73:38 - identity external identities so there's
73:41 - b2b and b2c so bw is when you're working
73:43 - with another
73:45 - organization and they probably have
73:46 - their own azure ad or their own identity
73:50 - service that they want to
73:51 - connect to your app or services and b2c
73:54 - is when you're dealing with customers
73:56 - they're not part of an identity service
73:58 - they're just
73:59 - individuals okay and so when we're
74:01 - talking about uh ipd support so identity
74:04 - providers it's a big old list here so
74:05 - you got adfs amazon apple azure id
74:09 - single tenant multi-tenant uh to b2c
74:12 - ebay facebook generic identity providers
74:14 - github id dot me google linkedin
74:17 - microsoft account qq salesforce
74:19 - salesforce sample protocol twitter
74:21 - wechat and weeboo and this is pretty
74:23 - darn
74:25 - thorough because when you look at amazon
74:27 - cognito which is aws is offering does
74:30 - not have linkedin does not have twitter
74:31 - does not have github i mean
74:34 - one of these might be able to be
74:35 - possible but it's very hard to implement
74:37 - on theirs and so this is where
74:40 - i feel that azure adb to c has a
74:42 - competitive advantage maybe not as great
74:44 - as uh okta uh which is a third party but
74:48 - i think that azure
74:49 - 80 b2c beats them on price for sure and
74:52 - meets most use cases if we're going to
74:54 - just do a quick comparison between the
74:55 - b2b and b2c offering just to really
74:57 - solidify the difference we break it down
74:59 - into scenario intended uh ipd support
75:02 - etc etc so let's just go through here
75:04 - and see what the difference is so
75:05 - looking at the scenario collaboration
75:07 - using microsoft applications this one is
75:09 - an i am for modern sas or custom
75:12 - developed applications for intended use
75:14 - cases uh collaborating with business
75:16 - partners for from external organizations
75:18 - and this is customers of your product
75:20 - for uh identity support you have work
75:23 - accounts school accounts any email
75:25 - address saml wsfed based identity
75:28 - providers gmail facebook and for a b2c
75:32 - you have local applications social
75:33 - identities users with corporate and gov
75:36 - identities et cetera b2c i believe it's
75:38 - more expensive
75:40 - between the two external user management
75:42 - managed in the same directory as
75:43 - employees and then for b2c managed
75:45 - separately from the organization
75:46 - employees and partner directories for
75:48 - sso uh azure the connected app is
75:51 - supported and for uh sso on b2c it's
75:54 - customer owned apps with azure adb 2c
75:56 - tenants is supported for policy and
75:59 - compliance managed by the host inviting
76:00 - organization and for b2c it's managed by
76:03 - the organizations via conditional access
76:05 - identity protection for branding the
76:07 - host inviting organization brand is used
76:10 - and for b2c it's fully customized
76:12 - branding per application or organization
76:15 - for billing models they're both based on
76:17 - monthly active users so m a use and
76:19 - there you go
76:20 - [Music]
76:25 - let's take a look here at service
76:26 - principles for azure id and this is a
76:28 - security identity used by applications
76:30 - or services to access specific azure
76:33 - resources so a service principle is
76:35 - created when a user from the tenant has
76:37 - consented to the applications or api use
76:40 - and so what you do is you go over to app
76:42 - registrations uh to be able to set up a
76:46 - service principle so this defines who
76:48 - can access the application and what
76:50 - resources the application can access so
76:53 - down below you can see we have a few
76:55 - different options here so whether it's
76:57 - the organizational directory
76:59 - from the current company or a different
77:01 - one or whether you're allowed to use a
77:03 - personal account so a service principle
77:05 - is created in each tenant where the
77:07 - application is used and references the
77:09 - global unique application object so
77:11 - after you've registered your application
77:13 - you're going to have an object id and an
77:14 - application id that's what i was talking
77:16 - about earlier when i said about
77:17 - application registration we come back to
77:19 - it well this is the part where we're
77:20 - seeing how that works so the application
77:22 - id represents the global applications
77:24 - across all tenants and the object id is
77:27 - a unique value for an application object
77:30 - so there you go
77:31 - [Music]
77:36 - so manage identities within azure id
77:39 - are used to manage the credentials for
77:41 - authenticating a cloud application with
77:43 - an azure service so using a managed
77:45 - identity you can authenticate to any
77:47 - service that supports azure id
77:48 - authentication without having
77:50 - credentials in your code that is why we
77:53 - want managed identities remember that
77:54 - there are two types of managed
77:56 - identities system assigns so an identity
77:59 - in an azure id tied to a life cycle for
78:01 - a service instance
78:03 - when the resource is deleted so is the
78:05 - system assigned to the manage identity
78:07 - for user assigned it's an identity
78:09 - assigned to one or more instance of
78:10 - services the identity is managed
78:12 - separately from the resource when a
78:14 - resource is deleted the identity remains
78:16 - i want to drill this in so let's do a
78:18 - quick table here between systems and
78:20 - user assigns so for creation created as
78:23 - part of the azure resource for user
78:24 - assign created as a standalone azure
78:26 - resource for life cycle shared life
78:28 - cycle with the azure resource
78:31 - for user assigned the independent it has
78:33 - an independent life cycle for deletion
78:35 - when you delete the resource so does the
78:37 - identity go with it
78:39 - for user assign it must be explicitly
78:41 - deleted for sharing across azure
78:43 - resources cannot be shared associated
78:45 - with a single azure resource for users
78:49 - assigned can be shared can be associated
78:51 - with more than one azure resource okay
78:55 - [Music]
78:59 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
79:01 - and we're taking a look here at device
79:02 - management for azure id so let's just
79:04 - define what device identity management
79:05 - is it is the management of physical
79:07 - devices such as phones tablets laptops
79:09 - desktops computers that are granted
79:12 - access to company resources such as
79:13 - printers and cloud resources via
79:15 - device-based conditional access so
79:18 - here's what it would look like if you
79:19 - opened up device manager and you had
79:21 - connected some devices notice on the
79:23 - left-hand side we got ourselves um a
79:25 - whoops i use the highlight tool i want
79:27 - the pen tool but we have some desktops
79:29 - and laptops we could have phones in here
79:30 - as well and there are different types of
79:32 - join types which we'll talk about here
79:33 - in a moment
79:35 - and you can
79:36 - apply mdm and we'll talk about mdm and
79:38 - mam in the upcoming slides but for
79:41 - companies with a distributed workforce
79:42 - that allows remote employees
79:44 - and who are allowed to use their own
79:46 - personal equipment this is what we call
79:47 - bring your own device
79:49 - so you should know byod a company needs
79:52 - a way to protect their organization's
79:53 - assets such as access to cloud resources
79:55 - across the devices where they have less
79:58 - control over the physical securities of
80:00 - the work environment so device
80:02 - management
80:03 - this stuff really ties back to the zero
80:05 - truss model that we talked about all the
80:07 - way at the start of this course um
80:09 - and this really illustrates how the
80:11 - identity is really your your uh
80:14 - the first security perimeter okay
80:16 - for uh getting devices into device
80:19 - management there are three different
80:20 - ways we have azure id registered so this
80:23 - is where you have personally owned or
80:24 - mobile devices you're signed in with a
80:26 - personal microsoft or local account and
80:28 - you'd be using things like windows 10
80:30 - ios android mac os for azure ad joined
80:33 - it's owned by an organization signed in
80:35 - with an azure id account belong to the
80:37 - organization they exist only in the
80:39 - cloud and you look at windows 10 windows
80:41 - server 2019 for hybrid azure ad joined
80:44 - it's owned by an organization uh you are
80:46 - signed in with azure director active
80:48 - directory not azure sorry active
80:50 - directory domain services accounts
80:52 - belonging to the organization and they
80:54 - exist in the cloud or on-premise you're
80:56 - looking at windows 7 8.110 windows
80:58 - server 2008 or newer
81:00 - they're not going to ask you about all
81:01 - these details in the exam but you should
81:03 - know broadly these three categories and
81:05 - that uh you know the hybrids for hybrid
81:07 - azure id join is for um uh is cloud only
81:10 - for organizations and this one top one
81:12 - here is for personal okay
81:14 - [Music]
81:19 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
81:21 - and we're taking a look here at mdm and
81:22 - mam so mobile device management allows
81:25 - you to control the entire device
81:27 - wipe data from it and also reset it to
81:29 - factory settings where mobile
81:30 - application management
81:32 - allows you to publish push configure
81:34 - secure monitor and update mobile apps
81:36 - for your users and both of these
81:37 - features are found
81:39 - under your azure ad so there you would
81:42 - add an application such as microsoft
81:44 - intune and that's what you'd be using to
81:46 - get mdm and mam features uh microsoft
81:49 - intune uh has to be to get access to it
81:51 - you have to upgrade to azure ad premium
81:53 - two and microsoft intune is now part of
81:56 - microsoft endpoint manager used to be a
81:58 - standalone service but now it's part of
82:00 - this and microsoft endpoint manager and
82:02 - intune are part of the microsoft
82:03 - enterprise mobility security uh ems it's
82:06 - just like a suite of services that work
82:08 - together so i know it's a bit confusing
82:09 - but in tune is is part of endpoint
82:12 - manager which is part of ems okay
82:14 - [Music]
82:19 - so windows hello gives windows 10 users
82:22 - an alternative way to log into their
82:23 - devices and application using
82:25 - fingerprint iris scan facial recognition
82:27 - so these are biometrics an
82:29 - authentication type with windows hello
82:30 - would include microsoft account active
82:32 - directory account azure ad identity
82:35 - provider services or something like 502
82:37 - which is a security key so i think ubiki
82:40 - windows hello pin is backed by a trusted
82:42 - platform module tpm chip
82:44 - it has multiple physical security
82:46 - mechanisms to make it tamper resistant
82:48 - the windows hello pin is more secure
82:50 - than a standard pin because it is tied
82:52 - to a specific device so the pin is for
82:54 - that device and only for that device
82:56 - okay
82:57 - there's two offerings here we have
82:59 - windows hello windows hello for business
83:01 - there's a lot more details here but i'm
83:02 - just going to give you the
83:04 - the the main difference so windows hello
83:06 - is for individual consumers and windows
83:09 - solo for business is for business uh
83:11 - windows hello uses a pin backed by
83:13 - hashing where windows hello uses a pin
83:16 - backed by an asymmetric public and
83:17 - private key or certificate-based
83:19 - authentication if you're a member or
83:21 - primer you know that a public and
83:23 - private key is just a lot more secure
83:25 - with windows hello for business you can
83:27 - also use group policies so gpo and mdm
83:30 - okay
83:34 - [Music]
83:36 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
83:38 - we're taking a look here at azure 80
83:39 - connect which is a hybrid service to
83:41 - connect your on-premise active directory
83:43 - to your azure account azure 80 connect
83:45 - allows for seamless single sign-on from
83:47 - your on-premise workstation to microsoft
83:49 - azure and it allows you to connect in
83:51 - the in the following ways so we have
83:53 - password hash synchronization which is a
83:55 - sign in method that synchronizes the
83:57 - hash of users on premise 80 password
83:59 - azure id password through authentication
84:01 - this is a sign-in method that allows
84:02 - users to use the same password on
84:04 - premise and in the cloud federation
84:06 - integration this is a hybrid environment
84:08 - using on-premise adfs infrastructure for
84:10 - certificate renewal these three are the
84:13 - authentication types okay so you want to
84:15 - remember those three some additional
84:16 - features we should cover the
84:18 - synchronization so responsible for
84:20 - creating users groups
84:21 - other objects ensures on-prem and cloud
84:23 - data matches and health monitoring
84:26 - robust monitoring and provides a central
84:28 - location in the azure portal to view
84:29 - activity this last one is called azure
84:32 - 80 connect health okay
84:34 - [Music]
84:38 - let's take a look here at self-service
84:40 - password reset also known as sspr this
84:44 - allows users to change or reset their
84:45 - password without the help of an
84:46 - administrator free up your help desk
84:48 - support requests add an additional layer
84:50 - of security and keep users more
84:52 - productive so self-service password
84:54 - scenarios include password change so
84:55 - when a user knows their password but
84:57 - wants to change it to something new
84:58 - password reset when a user can't sign in
85:00 - such as when they forget the password
85:02 - and want to reset account unlock when a
85:04 - user can't sign in because their account
85:06 - is locked out so authentication methods
85:08 - for ssrp would be like mobile app
85:10 - notifications mobile app codes email
85:13 - mobile phones office phones and security
85:16 - questions okay
85:17 - [Music]
85:22 - let's take a look at a feature called
85:23 - azure ad password protection and to
85:25 - understand this we need to know the
85:27 - concept of password spraying and this is
85:29 - a type of brute force dictionary attack
85:31 - uh and uh the idea here is that identity
85:34 - systems mitigate traditional brute force
85:36 - attacks by having lockout and after a
85:38 - lockout would be after a certain amount
85:40 - of attempts
85:41 - the user is locked out and has to wait a
85:43 - short period of time before they can try
85:45 - their password again you've seen this
85:46 - like five attempts and then you're
85:48 - locked out for like 30 minutes so
85:50 - password spraying circumvents lockout by
85:52 - spraying the same password across
85:54 - multiple accounts before trying another
85:55 - password while the lockout time cools
85:58 - down or resets and so azure id password
86:01 - protection is a feature of azure id to
86:03 - protect your passwords from identity tax
86:05 - such as password spray attacks okay the
86:09 - uh the mechanisms here is we have global
86:11 - uh global band password list so this is
86:13 - a password list with known weak
86:14 - passwords that is automatically updated
86:16 - and enforced by microsoft you don't have
86:18 - to do anything you just get that uh as
86:20 - you use the service then you have a
86:22 - custom banned password list this is
86:23 - where you're going to provide a custom
86:25 - list of passwords that are more specific
86:28 - to your business security needs to get
86:30 - banned passwords lists you need azure ad
86:33 - one or two
86:35 - for hybrid security azure id password
86:37 - protection can be integrated to
86:39 - on-premise active directory environments
86:40 - okay
86:41 - [Music]
86:45 - so here's just a quick list of azure
86:47 - identity management best practices it's
86:49 - nothing super fun here just a very
86:51 - simple list but it's good for us to go
86:53 - through it so we have where we keep
86:54 - these things in mind so
86:56 - azure identity management access control
86:58 - security best practices starting with
87:00 - treat identity as the primary security
87:02 - perimeter this all comes back to zero
87:04 - trust policies right a centralized
87:06 - identity management manage connected
87:08 - tenants enable single sign-on turn on
87:11 - conditional access plan for routine
87:14 - security improvements enable password
87:16 - management enable multi-factor
87:18 - verification for users use role-based
87:20 - access controls lower exposure of
87:22 - privileged accounts control locations
87:25 - when resources are located
87:27 - are located and use azure ad for storage
87:30 - authentication so there you go
87:32 - [Music]
87:36 - let's talk about the concept of
87:37 - emergency access or break glass so
87:39 - emergency access accounts prevent admins
87:41 - from being accidentally locked out of
87:44 - their azure ad account okay so you might
87:47 - have seen these kind of devices before
87:48 - think of like if there's a fire and
87:49 - there's ax behind it you break the glass
87:51 - so there's a key these are just in the
87:53 - case of emergencies that you can get
87:54 - access so you can mitigate the impact of
87:57 - accidental accidental lack of
87:59 - administrative access by creating two or
88:00 - more emergency access accounts in your
88:03 - organization so emergency access
88:05 - accounts are highly privileged and they
88:07 - are not assigned to a specific
88:08 - individuals
88:10 - they are limited to emergency or break
88:11 - glass scenarios where normal
88:13 - administrative accounts can't be used
88:16 - recommended to maintain a maintained
88:18 - goal of restricting emergency accounts
88:20 - used to only the times when it's
88:21 - absolutely necessary so these accounts
88:24 - should be cloud only accounts that use
88:26 - the onmicrosoft.com domain
88:28 - not federated or synchronized from an
88:30 - on-premise environment exclude at least
88:32 - one account from a phone-based
88:34 - multi-factor authentication exclude one
88:36 - account from a conditional access
88:38 - policies store these account credentials
88:41 - safely and monitor sign in and audit
88:43 - logs all right
88:44 - [Music]
88:49 - so azure active directory using mfa
88:51 - allows multiple authentication methods
88:54 - some of them is sms so that's where you
88:56 - have a text message and that's how you
88:57 - get your pin a voice call that has a
88:59 - synthesized voice that speaks your pin
89:01 - we have the microsoft authenticator app
89:02 - where you can use the app and press a
89:05 - button so you can do passwordless login
89:07 - and you have
89:08 - hardware tokens so this is where you
89:10 - touch your security key and authorize it
89:13 - by generating it and it will
89:14 - automatically generate and enter a pin
89:16 - for you so we'll just kind of dive a
89:18 - little bit deeper into these methods
89:19 - okay
89:24 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
89:25 - and we're taking a quick look here at
89:27 - microsoft authenticator so this is a web
89:29 - application or sorry a mobile
89:31 - application you can download for either
89:32 - your ios or android phone it allows for
89:34 - secure sign-ins for all your online
89:36 - accounts using multi-factor
89:37 - authentication
89:38 - password-less authentication password
89:40 - autofill and it's both available in the
89:42 - apple app store and google play store
89:45 - okay
89:46 - [Music]
89:51 - okay so i made my way over to the google
89:52 - play store because i just want to give
89:54 - you a a closer look at this service it's
89:56 - not complicated but if you click into
89:58 - here you can kind of see
90:00 - uh what it allows you to do so here we
90:02 - have a new sign-in request for your
90:03 - microsoft account so you would just say
90:04 - approve or deny so this is an example of
90:07 - password list right you don't have to
90:09 - put in a password to do the mfa
90:11 - um you can see when there are new
90:14 - sign-ins on your phone it will autofill
90:16 - passwords in so here it's doing for
90:17 - linkedin you can see you can manage uh
90:19 - multiple accounts and it has those um
90:22 - you know those the general mfa codes
90:24 - there it can connect to multiple
90:26 - services so you have your outlook your
90:29 - onedrive
90:30 - and office 65 in general or microsoft
90:32 - 365 so you know nothing too complicated
90:35 - but you should give it an install and go
90:37 - because it's pretty good
90:38 - [Music]
90:43 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
90:45 - we're taking a look here at the concept
90:46 - of biometrics so biometrics are body
90:48 - measurements and calculations related to
90:50 - the human characteristics and biometric
90:53 - authentication or realistic
90:54 - authentication is used in computer
90:56 - science as a form of identification and
90:59 - access control so
91:00 - we have different kinds of
91:01 - characteristics there's physiological
91:03 - which we'll go through quickly here so
91:04 - like a fingerprint pawn veins face
91:06 - recognition dna
91:08 - palm print
91:09 - uh hand geometry iris recognition retina
91:12 - or odor or scent
91:14 - that last one sounds very interesting
91:16 - i've never heard of a system that can do
91:18 - that but it's on the list here
91:20 - behavioral characteristics so
91:22 - this would be like typing rhythm gait
91:25 - keystrokes signature behavioral
91:26 - profiling and voice so there you go
91:32 - [Music]
91:33 - so fido is a fast identity online
91:37 - alliance it's an open industry
91:39 - association whose mission is to develop
91:41 - and promote authentication standards
91:43 - that help reduce the world's over
91:44 - reliance on passwords so fido alliance
91:47 - has published three sets of open
91:49 - specifications for simpler stronger user
91:50 - authentication the first being universal
91:53 - second factor so u2f universal
91:56 - authentication framework so uaf client
91:59 - to authentication protocol so ctap and
92:02 - ctap is complementary to the w3c web
92:05 - authentication so web auth n and
92:07 - together those are known as fido 2. so
92:10 - the reason we're talking about fido 2 is
92:12 - this always comes down to security keys
92:14 - so a security key is a secondary device
92:16 - used as a second step in authentication
92:18 - process to gain access to a device
92:20 - workstation or application a security
92:22 - key can resemble a memory stick when
92:24 - your finger makes contact with a button
92:26 - or exposed metal on the device it will
92:28 - generate an auto filler security token a
92:30 - popular brand of security keys is the ub
92:32 - key it works out of the box with gmail
92:34 - facebook and hundreds more supports 502
92:37 - auth and u2f and you just noticed we
92:39 - talked about all those things this
92:41 - particular device is waterproof and
92:43 - crest resistant works with usba nfc dual
92:45 - connectors on a single key it's going to
92:47 - vary based on
92:49 - the key you get they all have different
92:50 - features but this is a good baseline to
92:53 - understand security keys
92:55 - [Music]
92:59 - let's take a look here at open
93:01 - authentication also known as oath and i
93:04 - want you to know this is not to be
93:05 - confused with oauth very similar in
93:07 - names but not the same thing so
93:09 - oath is an open standard that specifies
93:11 - how time-based one-time passwords so
93:13 - totps codes are generated so time-based
93:16 - one-time passwords is a computer
93:18 - algorithm that generates a one-time
93:20 - password to otp which uses the current
93:22 - time as a source of uniqueness so uh
93:25 - oath totp is implemented using either
93:27 - software or hardware to generate code so
93:30 - for a software oath would be generated
93:32 - for something from like authenticator
93:33 - and hardware oath would be generated
93:35 - from a security key so this is an
93:37 - example actually in microsoft
93:39 - authenticator so just taking up my pen
93:41 - tool here this is the code you've you've
93:43 - seen these before so it's like three
93:45 - nine three eight one three there's a
93:46 - little wheel it spins and then it will
93:48 - reset the time here's more of a physical
93:51 - device i imagine that this is kind of
93:52 - the precursor to uh ubiki's or mobile
93:55 - apps the idea is that you'd have a
93:57 - physical device and it would count down
93:58 - it would change the times here okay so
94:00 - that's pretty much it
94:05 - [Music]
94:06 - password list authentication is a less
94:09 - frustrating authentication method than
94:10 - mfa and password list authentication
94:13 - methods are more convenient because the
94:15 - password is removed and replaced with
94:16 - something you have plus something you
94:18 - are or something you know so something
94:20 - you have could be windows 10 device
94:22 - phone security key something you are
94:25 - could be a biometric
94:26 - a biometric such as a fingerprint
94:28 - something you know could be a pin so or
94:31 - a password right so solutions for i
94:33 - guess not a password just be a pin but
94:35 - solutions for a password list
94:37 - authentication include windows hello for
94:39 - business the microsoft authenticator app
94:42 - 502 security key so just looking here we
94:45 - have kind of a
94:46 - four corners here inconvenient high
94:48 - security convenient low security so we
94:50 - put passwords on here generally they're
94:52 - very convenient everyone's used to using
94:54 - passwords however they don't have the
94:57 - highest amount of security from these
94:58 - other options sure you can make a very
95:00 - strong password but these other options
95:02 - are just passwordless authentication is
95:04 - a lot more powerful when you're using
95:06 - ufa
95:07 - or two-factor authentication
95:09 - multi-factor authentication
95:11 - it's highly secure
95:13 - but the issue with this is that it can
95:15 - be kind of a pain to pull out your phone
95:17 - to get that
95:18 - otp that one-time password in order to
95:21 - complete that second step so password
95:24 - authentic password-less authentication
95:25 - is both highly secure and convenient
95:27 - okay
95:28 - [Music]
95:32 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
95:34 - and we're taking a look here at azure ad
95:36 - conditional access which provides an
95:38 - extra layer of security before allowing
95:40 - authenticated users to access data or
95:42 - other assets so conditional access is
95:44 - implemented through conditional access
95:45 - policies and conditional access policy
95:47 - analyzes signals so signal could be user
95:50 - location device application real-time
95:52 - risk we'll talk about that in the next
95:53 - slide all the types of signals there are
95:55 - and the idea is you need to verify every
95:57 - access attempt via access control so you
95:59 - might have require mfa block or allow so
96:02 - just a visual here i got this graphic
96:04 - from the microsoft documentation the
96:06 - idea is you have your signal so user
96:08 - location application real-time risk
96:11 - devices and here we have our
96:14 - verification steps right to get access
96:16 - to our apps and data so let's take a
96:18 - quick or a a closer look at signals so
96:21 - signals is metadata associated with an
96:23 - identity attempting to gain access and
96:25 - so some examples or actually i guess the
96:28 - full list of signals that are possible
96:29 - conditional access starting with users
96:31 - or group memberships so policies
96:34 - target specific users and groups
96:35 - including admin roles giving admins fine
96:38 - grain control over access then you can
96:41 - have signals that are named location or
96:43 - ip location information so that's a
96:45 - range of ips
96:47 - used when making policy decisions so
96:49 - admins can opt to block or allow traffic
96:51 - from an entire country ip range as an
96:53 - example
96:54 - for devices users with devices of
96:56 - specific platforms are marked with a
96:58 - specific state can be used
97:00 - for applications users attempting to
97:02 - access specific applications can trigger
97:04 - different conditional access policies
97:06 - real-time real-time sign-in risk
97:08 - detection so signals integration with
97:11 - azure ad identity protection allows
97:13 - conditional access policies to identify
97:15 - risk sign-in behavior and policies can
97:18 - then force users to perform password
97:20 - changes mfa authentication to reduce the
97:23 - risk level or block
97:25 - or they're blocked from access until
97:27 - administrator takes manual action then
97:29 - you're do you have your cloud apps or
97:31 - cloud actions so cloud apps or actions
97:33 - can include or exclude cloud
97:34 - applications or user actions that will
97:36 - be subject to policy then there's user
97:38 - risk so from customers with access to
97:40 - identity protection user risk can be
97:42 - evaluated as part of conditional access
97:44 - policy user user risk represents the
97:47 - probability that a given identity or
97:48 - account is compromised user risk can be
97:51 - configured for high medium or low
97:53 - probability let's talk about common
97:55 - decisions so
97:56 - these define the access control that
97:58 - define what level of access based on the
98:00 - signal information and so this is when
98:03 - we were talking about you said that
98:04 - verifying steps these are those common
98:06 - decisions so we have block access so
98:09 - most restrictive decision then you have
98:10 - grant access and so this is the least
98:12 - restrictive decision but still requires
98:14 - one or more of the following options so
98:16 - require mfa require device to be marked
98:19 - as compliant require hybrid azure 80
98:21 - join device require approved client app
98:23 - require app uh protection policy okay so
98:26 - there you go
98:30 - [Music]
98:32 - let's take a look here at azure 80 roles
98:34 - and these are used to manage azure ad
98:36 - resources in a directory such as create
98:39 - or edit users assign administrative
98:40 - roles to others reset user passwords
98:43 - manage user licenses manage domains so
98:46 - if you're an azure id you'd see roles
98:48 - and administrators on the right-hand
98:49 - side and they have a bunch of pre-built
98:52 - roles of course you can make your custom
98:54 - ones but a few ones that you should
98:55 - absolutely know is the global
98:57 - administrator this gives you full access
98:58 - to everything the user administrator
99:00 - this gives you full access to create and
99:02 - manage users the billing administrator
99:04 - which makes purchases manage
99:05 - descriptions to support tickets and you
99:07 - can create custom custom roles but
99:08 - you're going to need
99:10 - azure p1 or p2 okay
99:12 - [Music]
99:17 - let's take a look here at azure role
99:19 - based access controls or rbac so the
99:21 - idea here is that you have a security
99:23 - principle that represents identities
99:25 - requesting access to azure resources so
99:27 - that could be a user who has an
99:28 - individual profile in azure id a group
99:31 - of users uh created an azure id a
99:33 - service principle and this is a security
99:35 - identity used by applications or
99:37 - services to access specific azure
99:39 - resources or manage identity an identity
99:41 - in azure id that is automatically
99:43 - managed by azure
99:44 - so
99:45 - another thing that we that matters when
99:47 - we're talking about
99:49 - role-based action controls is we have to
99:50 - determine the scope and so the scope is
99:52 - a set of resources that access for the
99:54 - role assignment applies to so scope
99:56 - access controls of the management
99:57 - subscription or group level right so you
100:00 - can apply it at this level a description
100:02 - level or the resource group level um
100:05 - just so you know okay
100:07 - the role definition is a collection of
100:09 - permissions a role definition lists the
100:11 - operations that can be performed such as
100:13 - read write and delete roles can be high
100:16 - level like owner specific like virtual
100:18 - machine reader and azure has built-in
100:20 - roles and you can define your own custom
100:22 - roles so the ones they have built in is
100:24 - owner contributor reader user admin
100:26 - access and these are the four
100:28 - fundamental built-in built-in roles that
100:30 - azure has
100:34 - [Music]
100:36 - so identity governance for azure id
100:38 - allows you to balance your
100:39 - organizational security versus employee
100:41 - productivity and that ensures the right
100:43 - people have the right access to the
100:45 - right resources so azure id and
100:48 - enterprise mobility plus security
100:49 - features allow you to mitigate asset
100:51 - access risks by protecting monitoring
100:54 - and auditing access to critical assets
100:56 - so identity governance gives
100:58 - organization the ability to do the
100:59 - following govern the identity life cycle
101:01 - govern the access life cycle secure
101:03 - privileges access for administration
101:05 - identity governance addresses these four
101:07 - questions so which users should have
101:09 - access to which resources what are those
101:12 - users doing with that access are there
101:15 - effective organizational controls for
101:17 - managing the access can auditors verify
101:19 - the controls uh that the the controls
101:22 - are working all right
101:23 - [Music]
101:28 - so human capital management also known
101:30 - as hcm is the practice of managing
101:32 - people as resources within an
101:34 - organization so an hcm system is an
101:36 - application that provides administrative
101:38 - and strategic support around human
101:40 - resources so for admins that's payroll
101:42 - benefits employee self-service portals
101:44 - for strategic we're talking about
101:46 - workflows workforce planning competency
101:49 - management performance management time
101:51 - and expense management education
101:53 - training recruitment onboarding
101:55 - organizational visualizations and so
101:57 - some hcm systems out there would be um
102:00 - success factors from us from sas
102:03 - the sas hcm
102:05 - for some reason they they had original
102:07 - service and then i guess they have a
102:09 - newer version of the service uh workday
102:12 - oracle e-business suite oracle
102:13 - peoplesoft same thing we're seeing with
102:15 - uh sap where they have two
102:17 - sage people and i don't know how to
102:19 - pronounce it we'll say uzio
102:22 - [Music]
102:26 - so giving a little bit more attention to
102:28 - the different types of life cycles and
102:29 - identity governance we're first going to
102:31 - look at um identify identity life cycle
102:33 - management and this is the foundation of
102:36 - identity governance the goal is to
102:38 - achieve a balance between productivity
102:39 - and security so here we can kind of see
102:41 - an identity where they have no access
102:44 - they get their first job their second
102:45 - job and then they retire so productivity
102:48 - how quickly can a person have access to
102:50 - resources they need such as when they
102:52 - join my organization security how should
102:54 - their access change over time such as
102:56 - due to changes to the person's
102:58 - employment status so azure ad premium
103:00 - automatically maintains user identities
103:02 - for people represented in something like
103:04 - workday or sap success factors in both
103:07 - active directory and azure active
103:08 - directory azure id
103:11 - azure ad premium also includes microsoft
103:13 - identity manager so
103:16 - you can import records from on-premise
103:18 - hcm systems such as sap hcm oracle
103:21 - ebusiness or oracle peoplesoft
103:23 - azure adb2b collaboration enables you to
103:26 - securely share your organization's
103:28 - applications and services with guest
103:30 - users and external partners from an
103:32 - organization while maintaining control
103:35 - over your corporate data so azure ad
103:37 - entitlement management enables you to
103:39 - select which organizations users
103:42 - are allowed to request access and to be
103:44 - added to b2b guests to your organization
103:46 - directory ensure these guests are
103:48 - removed when they're no longer
103:51 - they no longer need access okay
103:53 - [Music]
103:57 - now we looked at identity lifecycle now
103:59 - let's take a look here at access
104:01 - lifecycle so access lifecycle is the
104:03 - process of managing user access
104:05 - throughout the life cycle of an
104:06 - organization
104:07 - so here uh you know before we saw that
104:10 - someone changed jobs well this one has
104:12 - uh context because they're accessing
104:15 - something like they have a contract so
104:16 - there's a particular
104:18 - set of things that they have to worry
104:20 - about so azure ad dynamic groups
104:22 - determine group membership based on user
104:24 - or device properties azure 80 access
104:26 - reviews enforce review or on a regular
104:28 - basis to make sure only the right people
104:31 - have continued access azure ad
104:33 - entitlement management enables you to
104:35 - define how users request access across
104:38 - packages of groups and team memberships
104:41 - application roles sharepoint online
104:42 - roles okay
104:44 - [Music]
104:48 - so we have one more life cycle here and
104:50 - this one is privileged access life cycle
104:52 - and it is the management of fine grade
104:54 - permissions over the life cycle of a
104:55 - user within an organization so here they
104:58 - might they might start as an admin then
104:59 - they get their first role their second
105:01 - roll and then they leave it so again
105:03 - these are they're also very similar but
105:05 - they're just a different scopes so azure
105:07 - ad privilege identity management so pim
105:09 - provides additional controls to securing
105:11 - access rights for resources across azure
105:14 - ad azure and other microsoft online
105:16 - services and so that's pretty much the
105:17 - only one that really is related to
105:19 - privileged access lifecycle okay
105:21 - [Music]
105:26 - so entitlement management is a feature
105:27 - of azure ad and is for identity
105:30 - governance feature that enables
105:31 - organizations to manage identity and
105:33 - access lifecycle at scale by automating
105:36 - access request workflows access
105:38 - assignments reviews and expiration so
105:41 - entitlement management is a feature of
105:43 - azure ad premium two it takes a and just
105:46 - to kind of give it a more simplified uh
105:48 - understanding what the service does you
105:50 - take a bunch of resources bundle them
105:51 - into an access package then apply it to
105:54 - internal or external users that for a
105:56 - specific range of time get just in time
105:58 - access so you accomplish this by
106:00 - creating a project catalog and access
106:02 - package so what is a project inside of
106:05 - entitlement entitlement management well
106:07 - it's a logical container for your
106:08 - catalog and access packages you have a
106:10 - catalog so resources are assigned to the
106:12 - project
106:13 - and resources could be things like
106:15 - groups and teams applications sharepoint
106:17 - sites
106:18 - talking about access packages here an
106:21 - access package is a bundle of all the
106:23 - resources with the access a user needs
106:25 - to work on a project or perform their
106:27 - task access packages are used to govern
106:29 - access for your internal employees and
106:31 - also users outside your organization
106:34 - access packages also include one or more
106:36 - policies a policy defines
106:38 - the rules or guard rails for assignments
106:40 - to access packages for access packages
106:43 - you can manage group memberships cloud
106:46 - app access and access rights sharepoint
106:48 - online sites organizational and
106:50 - technical roles
106:55 - [Music]
106:56 - so privileged identity management or pim
106:59 - is an azure ad service enabling you to
107:01 - manage control and monitor access to
107:03 - important resources in your organization
107:05 - you can manage resources from azure id
107:07 - azure 365
107:10 - intune and more key features here is
107:12 - just in time privilege access to azure
107:13 - id and resources assign time-bound
107:16 - access to resources using start and end
107:18 - dates require approval to activate
107:20 - privileged roles enforce mfa to activate
107:22 - any role
107:23 - use justice justification to understand
107:26 - why users activate get notifications
107:28 - when privileged rules are activated
107:30 - conduct access reviews to ensure users
107:32 - still need roles download audit history
107:34 - for internal external audits so
107:36 - privilege identity management is a
107:37 - feature of azure 80 premium two but to
107:39 - get kind of an idea like i just pulled
107:41 - out a little screenshot of the interface
107:43 - there and so you can see you have
107:44 - requests and approval requests and
107:46 - review access so those are some of the
107:48 - things you're going to be doing in there
107:49 - okay
107:49 - [Music]
107:55 - so identity protection is
107:57 - a feature of azure id at the p2 level
107:59 - that you can use to detect investigate
108:01 - remediate export for future analysis
108:04 - identity based risks so microsoft
108:06 - analyzes 6.5 trillion signals per day to
108:09 - identify protect customers from threats
108:11 - so identity protection notices things
108:13 - like risky users risky sign-ins and
108:15 - risky detections so here's an example i
108:17 - know the image is blurry but it was hard
108:19 - for me to procure an image for you but
108:22 - this example shows newly risky sign-ins
108:24 - detected over a period of time
108:27 - and so then there might be these cards
108:29 - here that will show you um you know who
108:30 - are the high risk users the high
108:32 - resign-ins the identity score things
108:34 - like that okay
108:36 - [Music]
108:40 - let's take a more granular look to see
108:42 - what identity protection can actually
108:44 - detect so it can look for anonymous ip
108:46 - addresses so sign ins from anonymous ip
108:48 - addresses like a tor browser anomalizer
108:51 - vpns atypical travel so sign in from a
108:55 - atypical location based on the user's
108:57 - recent sign ins malware to ip addresses
109:00 - so sign in from a malware linked ip
109:01 - address unfamiliar sign in properties to
109:04 - sign in with properties we've not
109:05 - recently seen for a given user leak
109:07 - credentials site indicates that the
109:09 - user's valid credentials have may have
109:12 - been leaked
109:13 - password spray so multiple user names
109:15 - being attacked using common passwords in
109:17 - a unified brute force manner azure ad
109:20 - threat intelligence so microsoft
109:21 - internal external threat intelligence
109:23 - sources that have identified a known
109:25 - attack pattern so maybe new countries so
109:27 - this detection is discovered by
109:29 - microsoft cloud app security activity
109:31 - from anonymous ip addresses so the
109:33 - detection is discovered by the microsoft
109:35 - cloud app security so mcas suspicious
109:38 - inbox forwarding so this detection is
109:40 - discovered by
109:41 - microsoft cloud app security so mcas
109:44 - and the wrist signals can trigger
109:46 - remediation efforts such as requiring
109:48 - users to use azure 80 multi-factor
109:50 - authentication
109:52 - reset their password using self-service
109:53 - password reset so that's ss pr or
109:57 - blocking or blocking them until an
109:59 - administrator takes action
110:01 - [Music]
110:06 - let's take a look here at investigation
110:08 - for identity protection so identity
110:10 - protection categorized risks into three
110:12 - tiers low medium and high so key reports
110:14 - that the admins use for investigation
110:16 - and identity protection are risky users
110:18 - risky sign-ins and risky detection so
110:19 - for risky users those are details about
110:22 - detections history of all risky sign-ins
110:24 - risk history and then for risky risky
110:27 - sign-ins we have which risk sign-ins are
110:29 - classified at risks confirmed compromise
110:32 - confirmed sale dismissed or remediated
110:34 - we have real-time and aggregate risk
110:36 - levels with sign in attempts detection
110:38 - types triggered conditional access
110:40 - policies applied mfa details device apps
110:43 - location information and the last one
110:45 - here is risk detection so that contains
110:48 - filterable data for up to the past 90
110:50 - days
110:51 - so we have information about each risk
110:52 - detection including the type
110:54 - other risk triggers at the same time
110:56 - sign in attempt location link out to
110:59 - more detail for mcas
111:02 - so admin follow-up actions
111:04 - reset the user password confirm user
111:06 - compromise dismiss user risk block user
111:08 - from signing in investigate further
111:11 - using azure atp
111:12 - [Music]
111:17 - so network security groups filter
111:19 - network traffic to and from the azure
111:21 - resource in a v-net
111:23 - and so an nsg is composed of many
111:26 - security rules and so here's an example
111:29 - of setting an inbound security rule and
111:31 - each security rule has the following
111:33 - properties so you can give it a unique
111:35 - name which is all the way at the bottom
111:36 - there uh you can set the source or
111:39 - destination so you're gonna set an ip
111:41 - address cider block service tag
111:43 - application group things like that
111:45 - then you set the port range so it could
111:48 - just be port 80 it could be all ports
111:50 - where it shows an asterisk it could be a
111:52 - range of ports you can set the protocol
111:54 - so you got tcp udp icmp
111:57 - you set the action whether it's allowed
111:59 - or denied and then you set the priority
112:01 - which is a number between 100 and
112:03 - 4096 and we have two types of security
112:06 - rules we got inbound rules which applies
112:09 - to traffic entering the nsg and outbound
112:11 - rules that apply to traffic leaving the
112:13 - nsg
112:17 - [Music]
112:18 - let's take a look at some of the default
112:20 - security rules that nsg sets for you so
112:22 - when you create an nsg you're going to
112:23 - have some created for you by default
112:25 - and that's going to be for outbound
112:26 - rules and inbound rules so
112:28 - for inbound rules uh you're going to be
112:30 - able to
112:32 - accept any virtual networks into your
112:35 - through the
112:36 - nsg
112:37 - uh it's going to allow azure load
112:39 - balancer to make its way in and it's
112:41 - going to deny
112:42 - everything else all right
112:44 - then for your outbound rules
112:46 - it's allowed to go to any other virtual
112:48 - network it's allowed to make its way out
112:50 - to the internet and then everything else
112:52 - is denied so there you go
112:54 - [Music]
112:58 - let's take a look here at the logic for
112:59 - security rules and there's a lot of
113:01 - logic here so we'll work our way through
113:02 - it unfortunately there's no fun way to
113:04 - visualize this so we just got to work
113:06 - through the text so you may not create
113:08 - two security rules with the same
113:10 - priority and direction you can have 5000
113:12 - nsgs per subscription and 1 000 nsg's
113:15 - rules per nsg for priority rules are
113:18 - processed in priority order with lowest
113:20 - number uh processed before the higher
113:22 - number and network security groups uh
113:24 - rules are validated by priority using a
113:26 - five tuple information to allow or deny
113:28 - traffic based on source source ports
113:31 - destination destination ports and
113:32 - protocol honestly i don't know what they
113:34 - mean by that uh and i couldn't make any
113:37 - sense it's in the documentation so i'm
113:39 - just showing it to you here
113:41 - then there's flow records they don't
113:42 - exactly explain what they are but i
113:44 - assume the idea is that uh when a
113:47 - request throws uh flows through the nsg
113:49 - they're attaching additional information
113:50 - to it uh so the flow record allows a
113:53 - network security group to be stateful a
113:55 - flow record is created for existing
113:57 - connections uh communication is allowed
114:00 - or denied based on the connection state
114:01 - of the flow record
114:03 - and so let's talk about statefulness so
114:05 - if you specify an outbound security port
114:08 - you don't need to set the inbound port
114:10 - since it will be set for you you will
114:12 - need to specify an inbound security rule
114:14 - if the communication is
114:16 - initially externally
114:18 - initiated externally and the opposite is
114:20 - also true if inbound traffic is allowed
114:22 - over a port it's not necessary to
114:24 - specify an outbound security rule to
114:25 - respond to traffic over the port uh and
114:28 - the reason i know this when up when
114:30 - another port is set with another one
114:31 - that's when it's stateful if it didn't
114:33 - do that it then would be considered
114:34 - stateless but it's stateful
114:37 - let's talk about interruption so
114:38 - existing connections may not be
114:40 - interrupted when you remove a security
114:42 - rule that enabled the flow and traffic
114:45 - flows are interrupted when connections
114:47 - are stopped and no traffic is flowing in
114:49 - either direction for at least a few
114:50 - minutes so there's the rules uh a lot of
114:53 - stuff there honestly i won't even
114:55 - remember 90 of this stuff but i just
114:57 - wanted to go uh through it with you so
114:59 - there you go
115:03 - [Music]
115:05 - so the thing is is that when you have
115:07 - network security groups you can apply
115:09 - them at the subnet
115:11 - and or the nic and that's going to
115:13 - change how the rules work so let's look
115:15 - at these combination of scenarios so
115:18 - here we have the internet and let's set
115:20 - ourselves up with a virtual machine that
115:22 - has a nick but it has no network
115:24 - security group so what's going to happen
115:25 - in this case well when there is no nsg
115:28 - assigned to the subnet or nic then all
115:30 - traffic is allowed
115:32 - uh not something i recommend i think you
115:34 - should always have an nsg there uh but
115:36 - that's what's going to happen
115:38 - our next scenario here is that we have a
115:40 - virtual machine and then we have a neck
115:42 - and the network or the network security
115:44 - group is attached to that neck
115:45 - so when an nsg is assigned to the nick
115:47 - and no energy at the subnet then the
115:49 - rules are predictable based on the allow
115:51 - or deny rule so whatever you set your
115:53 - nsg is what you expect it to be
115:56 - then we have a scenario here where we
115:57 - have two virtual machines with their own
115:59 - nics
116:00 - and one has a security group and the
116:03 - other two
116:04 - uh you know the they have to pass
116:06 - through the security group that supplied
116:07 - the subnet level so let's look at the
116:09 - one the left first
116:10 - so the energy applied to a subnet
116:12 - applies to the rules and all the
116:14 - resources in that subnet
116:16 - and so basically on the left hand side
116:18 - it's going to just act like the the
116:20 - other one there where all the rules you
116:22 - have there are are normal but the last
116:24 - one is the interesting use case because
116:27 - if the first so the first thing is the
116:29 - the first nsg rules
116:31 - are evaluated at the subnet and then the
116:34 - rules in the nick are evaluated so
116:36 - the thing is is that if you want port 80
116:38 - to be open you actually have to open it
116:39 - on both
116:40 - otherwise it's going to get stuck uh on
116:42 - the first one so if your subnet has port
116:45 - 80 closed and then your your nic has
116:49 - port 80 open it just can't reach it so
116:51 - they both have to be open so there you
116:53 - go
116:57 - [Music]
116:58 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
117:00 - and we're looking at the azure network
117:01 - security group cheat sheet so nsgs
117:03 - filter network traffic to and from azure
117:06 - resources v-net an nsg is composed of
117:09 - many security rules you have a name a
117:11 - source and destination a port range and
117:13 - a protocol and an action a priority okay
117:16 - you have inbound rules which apply to
117:18 - traffic entering the nsg and then you
117:19 - have outbound rules applying to traffic
117:21 - leaving the nsg by default azure will
117:23 - set a bunch of inbound and outbound
117:25 - rules for you you may uh you may not
117:28 - create two security rules within the
117:30 - same priority and direction you can have
117:32 - 5 000 nsgs per subscription and 1 000
117:36 - nsgs per
117:37 - rules per nsg that's a lot you have to
117:40 - be pretty big company run out of those
117:42 - rules are processed in priority order
117:44 - with lower numbers processed before
117:45 - higher numbers the flow record allows a
117:48 - network security group to be stateful if
117:50 - you specify an outbound security port
117:52 - you don't need to set the inbound port
117:54 - since it will be set for you the
117:56 - opposite is true if inbound traffic is
117:58 - allowed over a port it's not necessary
118:00 - to specify an outbound security rule to
118:02 - respond to the traffic over the port
118:04 - what i could not fit in this cheat sheet
118:05 - was the scenario where you have multiple
118:08 - nsgs based on whether they're on the
118:10 - nick or the virtual machine or etc there
118:12 - is graphics for that in the in the
118:13 - slides make sure you review those before
118:15 - you set your exam okay
118:20 - [Music]
118:21 - azure firewall is a managed cloud-based
118:23 - network security service that protects
118:25 - azure v-net's resources and it's a fully
118:27 - stateful firewall as a service so you're
118:29 - going to get built in high availability
118:31 - and unrestricted cloud scalability and
118:33 - what you can do is
118:35 - essentially create enforce and log
118:36 - application network connectivity
118:38 - policies
118:39 - across subscription and virtual networks
118:41 - so azure firewall uses a static public
118:43 - ip address for your v-net resources
118:46 - allowing outside firewalls to identify
118:49 - or
118:50 - originating from your virtual network
118:51 - and the service is fully integrated with
118:53 - azure monitor for logging and analytics
118:56 - so here is a representation of azure
118:59 - firewall and so the idea is that you're
119:00 - going to launch an azure firewall into
119:02 - its own v-net and then other v-nets and
119:05 - your on-premise or other things are
119:07 - going to pass through that central v-net
119:09 - onto wherever they want to go and the
119:11 - idea is that we're going to be able to
119:14 - do things like i utilize microsoft
119:16 - threat intelligence this is going to
119:18 - block known malicious ips and
119:20 - fqdns that it stands for fully qualified
119:22 - domain names and by default the traffic
119:25 - is uh set to deny but you can set
119:29 - connectivity policies to filter out
119:31 - traffic in a variety of ways to make
119:32 - sure that you are protected
119:34 - uh there so yeah that's all there is to
119:37 - it
119:37 - [Music]
119:41 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
119:43 - and we're taking a look here at ddos so
119:45 - this stands for distributed denial of
119:47 - service attack and it's a malicious
119:49 - attempt to disrupt normal traffic by
119:50 - flooding a website with large amounts of
119:52 - fake traffic so the idea is you have an
119:54 - attacker and a victim and the attacker
119:56 - is utilizing a remote machines and uh
119:59 - with a with some software that's going
120:01 - to generate out traffic uh directed
120:03 - towards your virtual machine over the
120:05 - cloud and the uh problem here is that
120:08 - what it's going to do is it's going to
120:10 - make your website unresponsive or just
120:13 - not work at all for the regular user but
120:16 - by having your compute within the azure
120:18 - network you're going to get free ddos
120:20 - protection and that's going to mitigate
120:22 - these attacks so let's talk about the
120:24 - types of ddos attacks that frequently
120:27 - happen the first is volumetric attacks
120:30 - so these are volume-based attacks that
120:31 - flood the network with legitimate
120:32 - looking traffic these will exhaust the
120:34 - available bandwidth and legitimate users
120:37 - cannot access the website these are
120:39 - measured in bits per second so bps then
120:42 - there are protocol attacks and these are
120:44 - exhausting server resources with false
120:46 - protocol requests that exploit weakness
120:48 - you're looking at udp and tcp flooding
120:50 - on the layer three and four measured in
120:52 - packages per second so psp then you have
120:55 - application layer attacks these are
120:56 - attacks that occur at the application
120:58 - layer uh that's between layer seven so
121:00 - you're looking at http floods sql
121:02 - injection cross-site scripting also
121:04 - known as xss parameter tampering solaris
121:06 - attacks here you're going to be wanting
121:08 - using a waff a web application firewall
121:10 - as a means of protection laughs are
121:12 - generally paired a lot a lot together
121:15 - with ddos services across the cloud
121:17 - service provider
121:19 - offerings okay
121:20 - so azure offers two tiers of ddos
121:22 - protection the first is uh the the basic
121:25 - tier this is free it's already turned on
121:27 - uh it's part of the global network and
121:29 - then you have the standard that starts
121:31 - at about two thousand nine hundred and
121:33 - uh about three thousand usd you get
121:35 - metrics alerts reporting ddos expert
121:37 - support application cost protections sla
121:40 - there's probably a difference in terms
121:41 - of the tier protection i cannot remember
121:43 - off the top my head but you know one
121:45 - will protect more likely against certain
121:47 - types of tax at like like three and four
121:49 - and the other one will do all all the
121:51 - layers three four and seven okay
121:54 - [Music]
121:59 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
122:01 - and we're taking a look here at azure
122:02 - bastion which is an intermediate
122:04 - hardened instance you can use to connect
122:06 - to your target server via ssh or rdp an
122:09 - easy way to think of it it's just a
122:10 - machine that sits between you and your
122:12 - server to give you an additional layer
122:14 - of security so it will provision a
122:16 - web-based rdp client or ssh terminal and
122:19 - some devices just cannot run the rdb
122:21 - client so this is where a google
122:23 - chromebook uh is really great fit for
122:26 - azure bastion because this will be the
122:28 - only way you'd be able to do it is
122:29 - through azure bastion so when you want
122:31 - to make an a bastion you'll have to
122:33 - create its own subnet with a very
122:35 - particular name but some of the key
122:37 - features here of bastion is rdp and ssh
122:40 - directly into azure portal remote
122:42 - session over tls and firewall
122:44 - transversal
122:45 - no public ip required on the azure vm no
122:48 - hassle managing nsgs protection against
122:51 - port scanning protection uh protection
122:54 - against zero day exploits hardening in
122:56 - one place only uh so yeah
123:00 - now if you want to connect to a windows
123:02 - server you would have to use rdp
123:05 - and you have to have the bastion in the
123:06 - same vnet you just enter your username
123:08 - and password as you normally would if
123:09 - you did rdp so
123:11 - rdp is remote desktop protocol and the
123:14 - idea is that you just log in and now
123:16 - it's like you're using a windows machine
123:19 - then you have ssh which is for linux
123:22 - and so the idea here is you'd have your
123:23 - ssh private key and password that you'd
123:25 - set when you create your vm
123:27 - and when you want to hit connect you
123:29 - just provide either your password or the
123:31 - private key and now you're in your
123:33 - server so that's as simple as ask your
123:35 - bastion is
123:36 - [Music]
123:41 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
123:43 - and we're going to take a look here at
123:44 - azure web application firewall so uh
123:47 - azure web application firewall also
123:49 - known as waf is a service that protects
123:51 - web application communication on the
123:53 - application layer that's layer seven by
123:55 - analyzing incoming http requests uh waff
123:58 - for cloud providers are generally
124:00 - attached to load balancers api gateways
124:02 - or cdns so here's kind of a visual um
124:04 - that i got from the docs but the idea is
124:06 - you have your your request it's gonna go
124:09 - into your application load balancer the
124:11 - waf is attached to the load bouncer it's
124:12 - going to decide whether it's allowed to
124:14 - go through or not uh so it's kind of a
124:16 - bit of a gatekeeper there okay
124:19 - so azure waff can be attached to the
124:20 - azure application gateway azure front a
124:23 - front door which is a cdn azure con
124:26 - content delivery network which is a
124:28 - different kind of cdn uh and so the idea
124:30 - here is that azure waff uses core rule
124:32 - sets crs by owasp to protect against
124:36 - common vulnerabilities if you've never
124:37 - heard of owasp they stand for open web
124:40 - application security project and
124:42 - basically it's an organization a
124:44 - non-profit organization and they have
124:46 - all these resources on how to protect
124:50 - against different types of threats and
124:52 - they have basically this top ten a list
124:54 - of vulnerabilities so that's probably
124:56 - what they're using here um but anyway so
124:58 - a waff policy allows you to apply manage
125:01 - rules so the azure manage owasp rules
125:03 - and custom rules so there you go
125:08 - [Music]
125:10 - all right let's take a look here at the
125:11 - overview for azure encryption so we have
125:14 - three options here for encryption
125:16 - methods the first is azure storage
125:18 - service encryption also known as ssc and
125:21 - this protects data at rest by
125:22 - automatically encrypting before
125:24 - persisting it to the azure managed disks
125:26 - azure blob storage azure files azure
125:29 - queue storage it also is used to decrypt
125:31 - data on retrieval then you have azure
125:33 - disk encryption this encrypts windows
125:36 - and linux iaas virtual machine disks it
125:39 - can use bitlocker features on windows or
125:42 - dmcrypt on linux then you have
125:44 - transparent transparent data encryption
125:47 - tde which we'll talk about here in a
125:48 - moment
125:49 - [Music]
125:54 - all right so there are two available
125:56 - encryption options for azure managed
125:57 - disks the first is server side
125:59 - encryption ssc and azure disk encryption
126:02 - ade so for server side encryption it
126:04 - provides encryption at rest and
126:06 - safeguards your data to meet your
126:07 - organizational security compliance
126:09 - commitments it's enabled by default for
126:11 - all the managed snapshots and images
126:13 - except for temporary disks which are not
126:15 - encrypted by server-side encryption
126:17 - unless you enable encryption at the host
126:18 - level so keys can be managed uh two ways
126:22 - you have platform managed keys
126:24 - azure managers or keys or customer
126:26 - managed keys so you manage your keys
126:28 - then you have azure disk encryption ade
126:31 - this allows you to encrypt the os and
126:33 - data disks used by uh infrastructure as
126:35 - service vms so for windows you're going
126:38 - to be using bitlocker and for linux
126:40 - encryption you're going to be using
126:41 - dmcrypt so there you go
126:43 - [Music]
126:48 - so transparent data encryption also
126:50 - known as tde encrypts data rest for
126:52 - microsoft databases tde can be applied
126:55 - to sql server azure sql database azure
126:57 - synapse analytics and tde does real-time
127:00 - io encryption and decryption of data and
127:03 - log files encryption uses a database
127:05 - encryption key also known as a dek
127:09 - database boot record stores the key for
127:11 - availability during recovery the dek is
127:15 - a symmetric key so same cryptographic
127:17 - key uh for both the encryption or plain
127:20 - text cipher just an example there so you
127:22 - understand so the steps to apply to the
127:24 - database create the database master key
127:26 - create a certificate to support the tde
127:28 - create the database encryption key
127:30 - enable tde on the database so you just
127:34 - turn it on and there you go
127:38 - [Music]
127:40 - let's take a look here at azure key
127:41 - vault which helps you safeguard
127:42 - cryptographic keys and other secrets
127:44 - used by cloud apps and services so you
127:46 - have secrets management so store and
127:48 - tightly control access to tokens
127:50 - password certificates api keys and other
127:52 - secrets key management create and
127:54 - control the encryption keys used to
127:55 - encrypt your data certificate management
127:58 - easily provision manage and deploy
128:00 - public and private ssl certificates for
128:01 - use with azure and internal connected
128:04 - resources and hsms so secrets and keys
128:06 - can be protected either by software or a
128:10 - hardware one which would be fips 140
128:12 - hyphen 2 level 2 validated hsm so when
128:15 - we're talking about hsm this is a
128:16 - hardware security module it's a piece of
128:19 - hardware designed to store encryption
128:20 - keys so there's one and they're really
128:22 - darn expensive you wouldn't want to buy
128:24 - one out right it's a lot better if you
128:25 - just
128:26 - kind of borrow one from the cloud and
128:28 - this all goes along with the federal
128:30 - information processing standard fips
128:32 - this is a us and government standard
128:33 - that specifies security requirements for
128:35 - cryptographic modules that protect
128:37 - sensitive information so hmn's hsms or
128:40 - multi-tenant
128:41 - are 142 hyphen compliant so the multiple
128:45 - customers virtually isolated on an hsm
128:47 - if you want a single tenant this is this
128:49 - will give you a fips 140 hive and three
128:51 - compliance uh and this is for a single
128:53 - customer dedicated hsm i believe one is
128:55 - temp
128:56 - tamper evident and the other one is
128:58 - tamper proof um but uh yeah so for key
129:01 - vault the the single tenant is just a
129:03 - separate offering okay
129:05 - [Music]
129:09 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
129:11 - and we're taking a look here at azure
129:12 - security benchmarks so these includes a
129:14 - collection of high impact security
129:16 - recommendations you can use to help
129:17 - secure the services you use in azure
129:19 - include security controls and service
129:21 - based lines so azure security benchmark
129:24 - is a holistic security guidance
129:25 - influenced by the cloud adoption
129:27 - framework the azure well architected
129:29 - framework
129:30 - and the microsoft security best
129:31 - practices
129:32 - so we're talking about security controls
129:33 - these are recommendations that are
129:35 - generally applicable across your azure
129:36 - tenant and azure services each
129:38 - recommendation identifies a list of
129:40 - stakeholders that are typically involved
129:42 - in planning approval or implementation
129:44 - of the benchmark then you have service
129:46 - baselines so these apply the controls to
129:49 - individual azure services to provide
129:51 - recommendations on that service uh
129:53 - security configuration
129:55 - [Music]
130:00 - let's take a look here at azure security
130:02 - center and this is a unified
130:03 - infrastructure security management
130:04 - system it strengthens the security
130:06 - posture of your data centers provides
130:08 - advanced threat protection across your
130:10 - hybrid workloads in the cloud so here is
130:12 - what it looks like and the idea here is
130:15 - that you have a regulatory compliance
130:16 - dashboard that shows you your compliance
130:19 - posture for a set of supported standards
130:21 - regulations based on continuous
130:23 - assessment of your azure environment so
130:25 - the compliance policies currently
130:27 - supported are the azure security
130:28 - benchmark ppci dss iso 22701
130:34 - sock tsp so here you would see um a
130:38 - compliance policy and you can see that
130:41 - it has 32 out of 40 past controls if you
130:45 - drill down you could see those controls
130:46 - in detail uh then there there's the
130:49 - security score so security center
130:51 - continually assesses your resources
130:53 - descriptions and organization for
130:54 - security issues it then aggregates all
130:56 - the findings into a single score so you
130:58 - can tell at a glance your
131:00 - uh your current situation so the higher
131:03 - the score the lower the identified risk
131:05 - level so there you go you can see this
131:07 - one is at uh holding at 80 percent uh
131:10 - the security score helps with
131:11 - understanding your current security
131:13 - situation efficiently and effectively
131:15 - improving your security the security
131:17 - controls within azure security center
131:19 - are used to calculate the overall score
131:21 - so security controls are recommendations
131:24 - of actionable security items that will
131:26 - help improve your overall security score
131:28 - so there you go
131:29 - [Music]
131:33 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
131:35 - and we're taking a look at azure
131:37 - security benchmarks if you feel like
131:38 - you're having deja vu it's because i
131:40 - covered this earlier in the course but i
131:42 - wanted to give it a little bit more
131:43 - attention here so i described it in an
131:45 - alternate way here and digged a little
131:47 - bit deeper all right so before we can
131:49 - answer what the security benchmark is
131:52 - let's describe what a security baseline
131:54 - is so a security baseline is a set of
131:55 - minimum security controls defined for
131:58 - defined for low impact information
131:59 - systems moderate impact information
132:02 - systems and high impact information
132:04 - systems so security baselines for azure
132:06 - focus on cloud sensor control area uh
132:08 - control areas and these controls are
132:10 - consistent with well-known security
132:12 - benchmarks such as described by the
132:14 - center of internet security cis so azure
132:17 - security benchmark asb is a security
132:20 - baseline for azure and the benchmark is
132:22 - part of a set of holistic security guide
132:24 - guidance that also includes the azure
132:26 - cloud adoption framework azure well
132:28 - architected framework and the microsoft
132:30 - security best practices
132:32 - so the azure security benchmark has the
132:34 - following controls and these are grouped
132:36 - so you have network security identity
132:38 - management privilege access data
132:40 - protection asset management logging
132:43 - threat detection incident response
132:45 - posture vulnerability management
132:46 - endpoint security
132:48 - backup and recovery governance and
132:50 - strategy and this whole thing the azure
132:53 - security benchmark is actually just an
132:54 - excel spreadsheet that you can download
132:56 - uh and what it includes are
132:58 - recommendations with the following
132:59 - fields so azure controls ids
133:02 - recommendations guidance responsibility
133:05 - azure security monitor center
133:07 - whether the azure security center
133:09 - monitors this control which is kind of
133:11 - weird because when i actually opened it
133:12 - up these fields didn't exactly match one
133:15 - to one but i do i did pull out one in
133:18 - particular for us so we can see what it
133:19 - looks like so they'll have general
133:21 - guidance here so notice that they're
133:22 - just kind of like describing it so
133:24 - they're just saying what it can do and
133:26 - then we have some links and notice that
133:28 - it's linking to um
133:31 - i'm not sure which stock this is but
133:32 - when they talked about those three uh
133:34 - resources that's what they talk about
133:35 - when they're saying that they're
133:37 - influenced by those three for azure
133:38 - control this would be the asset
133:40 - management then it has its id uh then
133:42 - there are um uh cis controls so like
133:45 - these or nist controls so the idea is
133:47 - they're saying like yeah we have this
133:49 - control in our system but they map over
133:51 - to these well-known ones so you know you
133:53 - can trust them uh then there's the
133:56 - benchmark recommendation uh then there's
133:58 - responsibility so here's this customer
134:00 - and then there's customer stakeholders
134:02 - um and that points over to the cloud
134:05 - adoption framework so uh you know you
134:07 - can open it up and give it a read it's
134:08 - not super fun
134:10 - but this pretty much is the gist of it
134:11 - okay
134:12 - [Music]
134:16 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
134:18 - and we are taking a look here at azure
134:20 - defenders so azure defender provides
134:22 - advanced protection for your azure and
134:23 - on-premise workloads and azure defender
134:26 - can be found in the azure security
134:27 - center so with the security center
134:29 - there'll be a tab called azure defender
134:30 - and that's the way you find it so azure
134:32 - defender is composed of coverage
134:34 - security alerts insights and advanced
134:36 - protection so talking about coverage it
134:39 - allows you to see the resource types
134:41 - that are in your subscription and
134:42 - eligible for protection by azure
134:44 - defender so here take note that we can
134:47 - see things like virtual machines
134:48 - kubernetes services container registry
134:50 - app services sql vms vault
134:54 - key vaults sql servers and storage
134:56 - accounts
134:58 - for security alerts they describe
134:59 - details of the affected resources such
135:01 - as remediation steps and in some cases
135:04 - an option to trigger a logic app in
135:06 - response so here you can kind of see
135:08 - security alerts over time
135:10 - uh then there are insights this is a
135:12 - rolling pane of news suggested reading
135:14 - and high priority alerts that give
135:16 - security centers insights into pressing
135:18 - security matters that are relevant to
135:20 - you and your subscription for advanced
135:22 - protection within defender are
135:23 - additional security features that is
135:25 - driven by analytics so vm vulnerability
135:27 - assessments just-in-time vm access
135:30 - adaptive application control container
135:32 - image scanning adaptive
135:34 - network hardening sql vulnerability
135:36 - assessment
135:37 - file integrity monitoring
135:39 - network map iot security and so down
135:42 - below
135:43 - you can see all these options here
135:44 - whether they're turned on or not let's
135:46 - take a we'll take a look at network map
135:47 - here in a moment
135:49 - so scope of azure defender so it has a
135:51 - lot of different plans for specific
135:53 - azure resources so we have azure
135:55 - defender for servers app service storage
135:58 - sql kubernetes container registry key
136:00 - vault resource manager dns
136:03 - open source relational databases and
136:04 - when you turn on azure defender all
136:06 - plans are activated we saw that under
136:08 - the advanced protection tabs then just
136:11 - to kind of highlight network map because
136:13 - this one's really cool
136:14 - it's a network map that provides a
136:16 - graphical graphical view
136:18 - with security overlays giving you
136:20 - recommendations and insights for
136:21 - hardening your network resources so
136:24 - using the map you can see the network
136:25 - topology of your azure workloads uh
136:28 - connections between your virtual
136:29 - machines and subnets and the
136:31 - capabilities to drill down from the map
136:33 - into a specific resource resources and
136:35 - the recommendations of those resources
136:38 - and then just the last thing i want to
136:39 - touch on here is hybrid cloud protection
136:42 - so azure defender can protect vms
136:44 - residing in other cloud service
136:45 - providers such as aws and gcp via azure
136:48 - arc so azure arc if you've never heard
136:50 - of it is a control plane that can manage
136:53 - compute resources across cloud service
136:55 - providers on premise and at the stage or
136:57 - at the edge and so for infrastructure
136:59 - you'll notice that it can handle
137:01 - vms
137:02 - uh kubernetes clusters sql servers and
137:05 - azure stack hcis
137:07 - [Music]
137:11 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
137:13 - and we're taking a look here at azure
137:14 - sentinel so azure sentinel is a scalable
137:16 - cloud native security information event
137:19 - management so siem and security
137:22 - orchestration automated response so
137:24 - s-o-a-r a soar so azure sentinel
137:27 - delivers intelligent security analytics
137:29 - and threat intelligence across the
137:30 - enterprise providing a single solution
137:33 - for alert detection threat visibility uh
137:35 - proactive hunting and threat response so
137:38 - uh here's the big old wheel that azure
137:40 - sentinel likes to use to describe it
137:42 - and what's cool about this offering is
137:44 - it's both an siem and a source so you
137:46 - don't have to have two separate services
137:49 - talking about collect first so collect
137:50 - data at cloud scale across all users
137:52 - devices applications and infrastructure
137:55 - both on premise and in multiple clouds
137:57 - detect previously undetected threats and
137:59 - minimize false positives using microsoft
138:01 - analytics unparalleled threat
138:03 - intelligence investigate threats with
138:05 - artificial intelligence and hunt for
138:06 - suspicious activities at scale tapping
138:09 - into years of cyber security work at
138:10 - microsoft respond to incidents rapidly
138:13 - with built-in orchestration and
138:14 - automation of common tasks
138:16 - [Music]
138:20 - let's take a look at what azure sentinel
138:23 - can actually ingest from other data
138:25 - sources so we have a number of
138:27 - connectors here such as microsoft 365
138:30 - defender office 365 or microsoft 365.
138:33 - that's how they like to call it now
138:35 - azure ad microsoft defender for identity
138:38 - microsoft cloud app security and common
138:41 - event formats would be syslog rest api
138:44 - windows event logs common event format
138:46 - so cef and trusted automated exchange
138:49 - for indicator information or also known
138:52 - as taxi
138:53 - [Music]
138:58 - let's take a look here at azure
138:59 - workbooks and this is really a feature
139:01 - of azure monitor but azure central
139:03 - allows you to create workbooks really
139:05 - easily so workbooks provide a flexible
139:07 - canvas for data analysis and creation of
139:09 - rich visual reports within the azure
139:11 - portal they allow you to tap into
139:12 - multiple data sources from across azure
139:14 - and combine them into unified
139:16 - interactive experiences it tells a story
139:18 - about the performance and availability
139:20 - about your applications and services so
139:22 - here's a big funny graph and uh here's
139:25 - another one but the idea is that these
139:26 - are kind of like living documents where
139:28 - you can uh
139:29 - visualize the monitoring stuff
139:32 - with like written text and visuals so
139:34 - workbooks are temporary workspaces to
139:36 - find a document like format with
139:38 - visualizations intertwined to help
139:40 - investigate and discuss performance if
139:42 - you've ever used jupiter notebooks it's
139:43 - kind of similar but for logging
139:46 - [Music]
139:50 - all right so let's take a look at some
139:51 - of the core features of azure sentinel
139:54 - so i'm just going to go through a bunch
139:56 - of them here so let's get to it so azure
139:58 - sentinel uses analytics to correlate
140:00 - alerts into incidents so over here we
140:02 - can see that we have a list of them and
140:04 - incidents are groups of related alerts
140:07 - that together create an actionable
140:08 - possible threat that you can investigate
140:11 - and resolve
140:12 - then there's automation orchestration so
140:14 - with sentinel you have solutions that
140:16 - provide a highly extensible architecture
140:17 - that enables scalable automation as new
140:19 - technologies and threat emerge and this
140:21 - is just using azure logic apps so it's a
140:24 - great way of not having to use any code
140:26 - but you can chain things over
140:28 - into different services and they have
140:30 - over 200 connectors so there's a lot you
140:32 - can do here for investigations uh the
140:35 - investigation tools help you understand
140:38 - the scope and find the root cause of a
140:41 - potential security threat and you can
140:42 - choose an entity on the interaction
140:44 - graph to ask interesting questions for a
140:47 - specific entity and drill down into that
140:49 - entity and its connections to get to the
140:51 - root cause that's root cause analysis
140:54 - should wrote that in there for you
140:55 - for hunting
140:57 - so azure sentinel's powerful hunting
141:00 - search query based tools is based on the
141:02 - miter framework now you know why i
141:04 - covered that earlier which enables you
141:06 - to proactively hunt for security threats
141:08 - across your organizational data sources
141:10 - before an alert is triggered after you
141:12 - discover
141:13 - which
141:14 - hunting query provides high value
141:16 - insights into the possible tax you can
141:18 - create custom detection rules based on
141:20 - your query and service those insights as
141:23 - alerts to your security instance
141:24 - responders while hunting you can create
141:27 - bookmarks from interesting events
141:29 - enabling you to return them later share
141:32 - them with others and group them with
141:33 - other coordinating events to create
141:35 - compelling incident
141:38 - investigations so there you go
141:41 - [Music]
141:45 - so just a quick description here of
141:46 - azure sentinel pricing so it has two
141:48 - pricing models capacity reservation this
141:50 - is build a fixed fee based on the
141:52 - selected tier enabling a predictive
141:54 - total cost for azure sentinel and pay as
141:57 - you go so build per gigabyte for the
141:59 - volume of data ingested for analysis in
142:01 - azure sentinel and stored in azure
142:03 - monitored log analytics workspace
142:09 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
142:11 - and we are looking at microsoft 365 so
142:14 - it was formerly known as office 365 but
142:17 - you'll see me refer to it as office 365
142:19 - because everyone's used to with that but
142:21 - it is a suite of business software
142:22 - packaged as soft as a sas offering so
142:26 - there are a bunch of services you
142:28 - probably recognize quite a few of them
142:30 - and you can access it at the
142:31 - portal.office.com
142:33 - most notable services would be
142:35 - sharepoint so that's a site
142:36 - collaboration shared company document
142:38 - drive outlook that's an email service
142:40 - word processor which is word powerpoint
142:42 - that's slideshows excel that's
142:44 - spreadsheets teams collaboration app for
142:45 - your organizations similar to slack
142:48 - so there you go
142:49 - [Music]
142:54 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
142:56 - and we're taking a look here at
142:57 - microsoft 365 defender which is a
142:59 - unified pre and post breach enterprise
143:01 - defense suite the natalie natively
143:04 - coordinates responses such as detection
143:06 - prevention investigation across
143:08 - endpoints identities emails and
143:10 - applications to provide integrated
143:12 - protection against sophisticated attacks
143:14 - so if you're looking for where the
143:15 - service is you'd open up
143:17 - portal.office.com you look at the
143:20 - the side menu and you're clicking on
143:22 - security that is where
143:24 - you will find microsoft 365 defender so
143:27 - defender is composed of the following
143:28 - services it has a secure score
143:31 - endpoint
143:32 - it's for office 365 identity app
143:35 - security
143:36 - and so that's just kind of a graphic to
143:37 - reiterate over those four okay
143:40 - [Music]
143:44 - so within microsoft 365 defender you get
143:47 - a secure score and this is a
143:49 - representation of your organization's
143:51 - security posture and your opportunity to
143:53 - improve it via improvement action so uh
143:55 - this is very similar to azure defenders
143:57 - secure score they just have a slightly
144:00 - different terminology to make it a
144:01 - little bit more uh
144:05 - company friendly people that aren't
144:06 - developers but over here we have the
144:08 - secure score and then you see the
144:09 - improvement actions looks very similar
144:11 - to what we saw before
144:13 - [Music]
144:17 - so within microsoft 365 we have
144:20 - endpoints and these are a set of
144:21 - destination ip addresses dns domain
144:23 - names and urls for microsoft 365 traffic
144:26 - on the internet so to optimize
144:28 - performance for m365 cloud-based
144:31 - services these endpoints need special
144:33 - handling by client browsers in the
144:35 - devices in your edge network and these
144:37 - devices include firewalls ssl brakes and
144:39 - inspect packet inspection devices and
144:42 - data loss protection dlp
144:45 - system so this is what it looks like
144:47 - again it's just ip addresses and dns
144:49 - domains so endpoints are grouped into
144:52 - four service areas exchange online
144:54 - sharepoint online and onedrive for
144:55 - business skype for business online and
144:57 - microsoft teams and uh m365 common
145:01 - office online so it's just a bunch of
145:03 - these things here on the left hand side
145:06 - but they specialize for those particular
145:08 - areas so now taking a look here at
145:10 - microsoft defender for endpoint is an
145:12 - enterprise endpoint security platform
145:15 - designed to help enterprise networks
145:16 - prevent detect investigate and respond
145:19 - to advanced threats
145:21 - and so defender for endpoint uses the
145:23 - following combination of technology
145:24 - built into windows 10 and microsoft
145:26 - cloud service so we have endpoint
145:28 - behavioral sensors so embedded in
145:30 - windows 10 these sensors collect and
145:33 - process behavioral signals from os and
145:37 - send this sensor data to your private
145:39 - isolated cloud instances of microsoft
145:41 - defender for endpoint then you have
145:43 - cloud security analytics so this is
145:45 - leveraging big data device learning and
145:47 - unique microsoft optic
145:49 - optics across the windows ecosystem
145:52 - enterprise cloud products such as office
145:53 - 365
145:55 - and online assets behavioral signals are
145:57 - translated into insights
145:59 - detections and recommended responses to
146:02 - advanced threats then we have threat
146:04 - intelligence this is generated by
146:06 - microsoft hunters security teams and
146:07 - augmented by
146:09 - by threat intelligence providers by
146:10 - partners threat intelligence enables
146:13 - defender for endpoint to identify attack
146:15 - attacker tools techniques procedures and
146:18 - generate alerts when they are observed
146:20 - in collected sensor data
146:22 - [Music]
146:27 - so within uh microsoft 365 defender you
146:30 - have security reports and these are
146:32 - general security dashboards about
146:34 - security trends for m365 identities
146:36 - device and apps information is organized
146:38 - into cards on the dashboard so you have
146:40 - identities where we'll have users at
146:42 - risk and global admins then you have
146:44 - devices so devices at risk device
146:47 - compliance devices with active malware
146:49 - types of malware on devices malware on
146:51 - devices devices with malware detection
146:54 - users with malware detection
146:56 - then you have apps which have risk
146:58 - levels and so all this information can
147:01 - be reorganized so right now we have
147:03 - identities devices and apps but we could
147:05 - also have risk detection threads and
147:07 - configuration health so just to kind of
147:09 - tell you a little bit more here it's
147:11 - just imagine you have a bunch of these
147:12 - cards and they're broken down by all
147:14 - these categories here so you can have a
147:17 - bird's eye view of what's going on okay
147:20 - uh one particular report that is
147:21 - interesting to show you is the office
147:23 - 625 exchange one so this is email
147:25 - collaboration reports so just kind of
147:27 - gives you statistics over time so that's
147:29 - a viewer to drill down into a particular
147:31 - type of report here um and so you can
147:33 - kind of see things like you know spam
147:35 - detection over time spoof detection
147:38 - things like that okay
147:43 - [Music]
147:44 - so m365 defender for identity is a
147:47 - cloud-based security solution that
147:48 - leverages your on-premise active
147:50 - directory signals to identify detect and
147:51 - investigate advanced threats compromise
147:54 - identities and malicious insider actions
147:56 - directed at your organization it detects
147:59 - advanced attacks in hybrid environments
148:00 - to monitor users entity behaviors and
148:03 - activities with learning based analytics
148:05 - protect user identities and credentials
148:07 - and stored in active directory identify
148:09 - investigate suspicious user activities
148:11 - and advanced attacks throughout the kill
148:13 - chain provide clear incident information
148:15 - on simple timeline for fast triage i had
148:18 - the hardest time trying to find any kind
148:20 - of screenshot for this and i just kind
148:23 - of gave up so i mean you have the gist
148:25 - of it but it's nice to have a visual you
148:27 - know so microsoft defender for identity
148:29 - monitors your domain controllers by
148:31 - capturing and parsing network traffic
148:33 - and leveraging windows events directly
148:35 - from your domain controllers then
148:37 - analyzes the data for attacks and
148:39 - threats so here is kind of the
148:40 - architecture of it so
148:43 - you know we have our domain controller
148:45 - over here then we have microsoft
148:47 - defender identity
148:48 - and then it's going to go to our cas
148:51 - mcas so that we can do some analysis and
148:54 - stuff later on and you could pass it off
148:56 - over to your siem or azure sentinel and
148:59 - things like that so utilizing profiling
149:02 - deterministic detection machine learning
149:03 - behavioral algorithms defender for
149:05 - identity learns about your network
149:07 - enables detection of anomalies and warns
149:09 - you of suspicious activities
149:11 - [Music]
149:16 - so microsoft defender for office 365
149:18 - protects against advanced threats by
149:20 - email messages links teams sharepoint
149:23 - onedrive for business and other
149:25 - clients and protection is provided via
149:27 - reports threat investigations thread
149:30 - responses
149:31 - threat protection policies and there's
149:33 - three available subscriptions we have
149:35 - the exchange online protection the
149:37 - defender for office 365 plan one and
149:40 - plan two
149:41 - and office 365 security builds on the
149:44 - core protections offered by eop so eop
149:46 - is present in any subscription where
149:49 - exchange online mailboxes can be found
149:52 - so go in more detail here for eop
149:54 - cloud-based filtering service that
149:56 - protects your organizations against spam
149:57 - malware and other email threats defender
150:00 - office p1 safe attachments checks email
150:02 - attachments for malicious content safe
150:05 - links links are scanned for each click a
150:07 - safe link remains accessible but
150:08 - malicious links are blocked protection
150:11 - for sharepoint onedrive microsoft teams
150:12 - identifies and blocks malicious files in
150:15 - team sites and document libraries
150:17 - anti-phishing protection so it detects
150:19 - attempts to impersonate your users
150:20 - internal or custom domains real-time
150:23 - detection a real-time report that allows
150:25 - you to identify and analyze recent
150:26 - threats for defender for office
150:29 - p2 i don't know why i didn't highlight
150:30 - that one but that's how it goes includes
150:32 - defender office p1 features so we have
150:34 - threat trackers latest intelligence and
150:36 - cyber security issues takes counter
150:38 - measurements before an actual threat
150:40 - threat explorer so real-time reports
150:42 - that allows you to identify and analyze
150:44 - recent threats automated investigation
150:46 - and response also known as air is a set
150:49 - of security playbooks that can be
150:50 - launched automatically start an
150:52 - automatic investigation provide detailed
150:54 - reports recommend action security teams
150:56 - can can approve i'm describing what a
150:58 - playbook is there so attack simulator so
151:01 - run realistic attack scenarios in your
151:03 - organization to identify vulnerabilities
151:05 - so you can see that p2 is very very good
151:07 - a bit more detail on the eop here
151:10 - is an on is a cloud-based filtering
151:12 - service that protects your organization
151:14 - from spam malware and other evil threats
151:17 - i know we just said it but here is kind
151:18 - of the graphic and so this has features
151:20 - for anti-malware inbound anti-spam uh
151:23 - outbound spam connection filtering
151:24 - anti-fishing anti-spoofing zero outer
151:28 - auto purge zap for delivered malware
151:30 - spam and phishing messages preset
151:32 - security policies
151:34 - 10 allow block list
151:36 - allow block lists for message senders
151:38 - directory based edge blocking so dbeb
151:43 - mail flow rules accepted domains message
151:45 - training and more i just couldn't fit
151:47 - them all on the screen but i just wanted
151:48 - to show you how valuable
151:51 - exchange online protection is and that's
151:53 - one reason why you don't want to be
151:54 - using
151:56 - i mean you could but like this is one of
151:57 - the advantages of
151:59 - exchange over gmail okay
152:01 - [Music]
152:06 - so microsoft cloud app security mcas is
152:09 - a cloud access security broker so casb
152:13 - that sits between the user and the cloud
152:15 - service provider to gateway access in
152:17 - real time to cloud services if you're
152:19 - getting tired of the initialisms so am i
152:22 - because there's just so many uh mcas is
152:24 - built on top of the four principles of
152:26 - the microsoft cloud app security
152:28 - framework discover and control the the
152:31 - use of shadow it so identify cloud apps
152:34 - ias pass
152:36 - services used by your organization
152:37 - investigate usage patterns uh patterns
152:40 - assess uh and risk levels assesses and
152:42 - risk levels and business readiness for
152:44 - more than 16 000 sas apps against more
152:47 - than 80 risks starts managing them to
152:49 - ensure security and compliance then you
152:51 - have protect your sensitive information
152:52 - anywhere in the cloud understand
152:54 - classify protect the exposure of
152:57 - sensitive information at rest leverage
152:59 - out the box policies and automated
153:02 - processes to apply control in real time
153:04 - across all cloud apps protect against
153:07 - cyber threats and anomalies to detect
153:09 - unusual behavior across cloud apps to
153:11 - identify ransomware compromise croppers
153:14 - users or rogue applications analyze high
153:16 - risk usage and remediate automatically
153:18 - to limit the risks to your organization
153:21 - assess the compliance of your cloud apps
153:24 - so assesses if your cloud app meets
153:25 - relevant compliance requirements
153:27 - including regulatory compliance and
153:29 - industry standards prevent data leaks to
153:31 - non-compliant apps and limit access to
153:34 - regulated data more information we're
153:36 - not done
153:38 - cloud app security
153:39 - integrates visibly with your cloud by uh
153:42 - using cloud discovery to map and
153:44 - identify your cloud environment and the
153:46 - cloud apps
153:48 - using your organization so just take
153:50 - note over here
153:52 - okay sanctioning and unsanctioning
153:55 - apps in your cloud
153:57 - using
153:58 - easy to deploy app connectors that take
154:00 - advantage of provider apis for
154:02 - visibility governments of your apps that
154:04 - you connect to
154:05 - using conditional access
154:07 - uh app control protection to gain
154:10 - real-time visibility and control over
154:12 - access and activities within your cloud
154:14 - apps helping you have continuous control
154:17 - by setting and then continually
154:18 - fine-tuning policies office 365 cloud
154:21 - app security is a subset of microsoft
154:24 - cloud app security so there is a variant
154:26 - here for us and this has threat
154:27 - protection based on user activity logs
154:29 - discover shadow it for apps with similar
154:32 - functionality to office 65 offering yeah
154:34 - get this for no extra cost if you have
154:36 - azure premium one okay
154:43 - [Music]
154:48 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
154:49 - and we're going to take a look here at
154:50 - microsoft endpoint manager so microsoft
154:53 - intune and configuration manager were
154:55 - two separate products and they were
154:56 - merged into a single service called
154:57 - microsoft endpoint manager because
154:59 - they're so darn similar but they had
155:01 - different product uh marketing all this
155:03 - stuff and just got really confusing so
155:05 - they just rolled it into one
155:07 - so microsoft intune is used for managing
155:09 - the security of mobile devices
155:10 - configuration manager
155:13 - is used to manage desktop servers and
155:14 - laptops
155:16 - this can all be accessed via the
155:17 - endpoint.microsoft.com
155:20 - that's where the microsoft endpoint
155:21 - manager admin center is
155:23 - we'll just talk about intune
155:24 - configuration manager is pretty similar
155:26 - so we don't need to go into details
155:28 - about that but microsoft intune is a
155:30 - mobile device and mobile application
155:32 - manager so mdm mam found within the
155:35 - microsoft endpoint manager so it can
155:37 - manage devices manage security baselines
155:39 - use policies to manage device security
155:42 - use device compliance policies configure
155:44 - conditional access integration with
155:46 - microsoft defender endpoint role based
155:48 - access controls and it integrates with
155:51 - azure id mobile threat defenders admx
155:54 - templates win32 custom lob apps
155:59 - and more so microsoft intune can be used
156:01 - to manage on-premise infrastructure via
156:03 - intune connectors which i think that's
156:04 - pretty cool intune connectors for
156:06 - active directory intune certificate
156:09 - certificate connector and there we go
156:11 - [Music]
156:16 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
156:17 - and we're looking at the concept of
156:18 - regulatory compliance so what is
156:20 - compliance it's conforming to rules such
156:22 - as a specification policy standard or
156:24 - law and regulatory compliance is an
156:26 - organization that takes an effort to
156:28 - comply with relevant laws policies and
156:30 - regulations so regulatory compliance can
156:32 - vary at the following level so federal
156:34 - state
156:35 - political and economic union and
156:37 - international organization so why do we
156:40 - have regulatory compliance will
156:41 - governments want to protect its citizens
156:43 - data that is collected by companies and
156:45 - organizations what are compliance
156:47 - controls well those are internal control
156:49 - mechanisms that need to be in place to
156:51 - detect prevent and correct compliance
156:53 - issues so public standards and policies
156:56 - document procedures uh training
156:59 - monitoring internal audits so what can
157:02 - uh they do to uh enforce these things so
157:05 - they have or the idea is why like what
157:07 - will the measures of regulatory
157:09 - compliance enforce so citizens get the
157:11 - right to access their data anytime the
157:13 - right to correct or uh or delete their
157:15 - data if needed retention periods that
157:17 - for a minimum or maximum time data
157:19 - should be stored enabling governments
157:21 - and regulatory agencies the right to
157:23 - access and examine data when necessary
157:26 - defining rules for what data can be
157:27 - processed and how
157:29 - that should be done okay
157:31 - [Music]
157:35 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
157:37 - and we're going to take a look here at
157:38 - the m365 compliance center so this
157:41 - provides easy access to data and tools
157:43 - that you need to manage your
157:44 - organizational compliance needs so here
157:46 - is a screenshot and the way you get
157:47 - there is compliance.microsoft.com
157:50 - sometimes these things are hard to find
157:52 - so you got to know what these domains
157:53 - are so some of the features here would
157:54 - be compliance score audits activity
157:56 - alerts solution catalog data
157:58 - classification e-discovery insider risk
158:01 - management records management and that
158:02 - is not the definitive list there's a lot
158:04 - of stuff in here
158:05 - don't worry we are going to spend quite
158:06 - a bit of time around compliance center
158:08 - in this course so you know we're going
158:10 - to dive deeper on some of these things
158:12 - if you want to access compliance center
158:13 - you need to be either a global
158:15 - administrator compliance administrator
158:16 - or a compliance data administrator
158:18 - [Music]
158:22 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
158:24 - and we're taking a look here at the
158:25 - azure trust center and this is a public
158:27 - facing website portal providing easy
158:29 - access to privacy security regulatory
158:31 - compliance information so yeah it's just
158:33 - a simple website but one of the cool
158:35 - features here is audit reports so auto
158:37 - reports is an independent audit report
158:39 - for microsoft cloud services which
158:40 - provides information about compliance
158:42 - with data protection standards and
158:44 - regulatory requirements so you'll get
158:45 - reports for iso sock nist fedramp gdpr
158:49 - and so you've got a big old list there
158:51 - of docs and pdfs you can download you
158:53 - can open them up and then see how
158:55 - microsoft and azure is being compliant
158:57 - [Music]
159:01 - hey it's andrew brown from exam pro
159:03 - we're going to take a look here at
159:03 - compliance manager so this is an at a
159:05 - glance summary for of the shared
159:07 - responsibility model for microsoft and
159:09 - your organization now i got a bit
159:10 - confused because i use it in one place
159:12 - and i found it somewhere else but it
159:13 - turns out there's two versions of this
159:15 - there's one in the microsoft trust
159:17 - center or azure trust center which is
159:18 - the classic compliance manager and then
159:20 - there's the m365 compliance center the
159:23 - compliance manager the screenshots here
159:24 - from the classic but the information is
159:26 - the same okay so risk assessment
159:29 - workflow and management tools is one of
159:30 - the things you get with this so provides
159:32 - task assignment and verification to help
159:34 - governance risk compliance teams and iet
159:36 - departments work together to streamline
159:38 - internal compliance activities you get
159:40 - intelligent tracking this understands
159:42 - common similar compliance activities
159:43 - across multiple standards
159:46 - and regulations to reduce your
159:47 - organization costs and efforts from
159:49 - regulation to audit by applying a single
159:52 - activity to multiple assessments or
159:53 - controls
159:54 - each uh each assessed control will be
159:56 - labeled preventative detective or
159:58 - corrective and will be mandatory or
160:00 - discretionary as assessments for gdpr
160:03 - uh nist and iso for office 365 for azure
160:06 - we have gdbr
160:08 - iso
160:09 - 2718 and then 2701 and hipaa and so this
160:13 - is what it kind of looks like here is
160:15 - the card that shows the compliance you
160:17 - have a compliance score now i imagine
160:19 - and maybe we'll look at this moment but
160:20 - m365 compliance center will be all
160:22 - around uh m365 assets and maybe the
160:25 - classic one combines both azure and
160:27 - microsoft but we'll have to investigate
160:30 - that so clicking into an assessment will
160:31 - give you a detailed list of actionable
160:33 - controls so here you see the controls
160:36 - and it has a score and you can assign it
160:38 - to someone and etc so yeah there you go
160:41 - [Music]
160:45 - okay since compliance manager has two
160:47 - variants i figured just to avoid
160:49 - confusion we should take a closer look
160:50 - at it here i have the
160:53 - microsoft 65 compliance center open at
160:55 - the top here you see compliance manager
160:57 - and so you have an overview improvement
160:59 - action solution so here you can see a
161:01 - compliance score and then here it has
161:03 - the improved actions these are really
161:04 - slow loading so i just opened another
161:06 - tab here so down below you can see the
161:08 - improvement actions um you know they
161:11 - generally look the same you can assign
161:12 - it to a user etc i don't know what we
161:15 - get if we click into it let's take a
161:16 - look
161:17 - again very slow loading um yeah so how
161:20 - to implement and then more information
161:22 - you can make implement implementation
161:24 - notes they have testing standard
161:26 - regulation documents so there's stuff
161:28 - you can do here to
161:29 - collect an audit to make sure that you
161:31 - are doing what you're supposed to be
161:32 - doing over in the service trust center
161:34 - you can drop it down you see classic
161:35 - compliance manager this is where we just
161:37 - were so for classic you'd connect it to
161:39 - your
161:40 - azure account just scroll down you'd see
161:42 - these cards here so you can click into a
161:44 - card
161:46 - and just expand it and see what kind of
161:48 - things you need to do there so there you
161:50 - go that is the two variants of
161:51 - compliance manager
161:52 - [Music]
161:56 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
161:58 - and we're taking a look here at
161:59 - compliance programs and so there's a lot
162:01 - of different ones uh that are for azure
162:04 - but i figured we should go through some
162:06 - of them so you get a bit more
162:07 - familiarity with this same stuff we
162:09 - covered in the az900 but if you didn't
162:12 - take that certification this is a great
162:14 - opportunity to
162:15 - see them firsthand okay so the first one
162:17 - here is the criminal justice information
162:19 - services this stands for uh this
162:21 - initialism here is cjis so any state or
162:24 - local agency that wants access to the
162:26 - fbi's database is required to adhere to
162:29 - the uh cjis security policy then you
162:33 - have the cloud security alliance csa
162:35 - star certification this is an
162:36 - independent third party assessment of a
162:38 - cloud provider security posture then you
162:41 - have the gdpr this is a european privacy
162:43 - law imposes new rules on companies
162:45 - governments agencies non-profits and
162:46 - other orgs that offer goods and services
162:48 - to people in the european union or that
162:50 - collect analyze data tied to eu
162:53 - residents this one is a very well known
162:56 - one because even if you don't live in
162:57 - the eu you still basically have to
162:59 - enforce this on your website this goes
163:01 - for everybody which is if people want to
163:03 - uh delete their data they should be able
163:05 - to they should know what kind of data is
163:06 - being collected etc we have the eu model
163:08 - clauses this is the contractual
163:10 - guarantees around transfers of personal
163:12 - data outside the eu
163:14 - you have hipaa so this is a u.s federal
163:16 - law that regulates patient protected
163:18 - health information you have the iso
163:21 - 27018 this is a code of practice
163:23 - covering the processing of personal
163:24 - information by cloud service providers
163:27 - you have um
163:28 - multi-tier cloud security this is
163:30 - operational singapore security
163:32 - management standard it's a common center
163:34 - that that cloud service providers can
163:36 - apply to address customer concerns about
163:38 - security and confidence confidential uh
163:40 - led of data in the cloud and impact of
163:42 - business of using cloud services then
163:45 - you have socks service organization
163:47 - controls there's sock one two and three
163:50 - so these are independent third-party
163:51 - examination reports that demonstrate how
163:54 - the company achieves key compliance
163:56 - controls and objectives generally
163:58 - uh tech companies are going for sock to
164:00 - compliance um
164:02 - so we'll go into the next section here
164:03 - we have nist cyber security framework
164:05 - this is a voluntary framework that
164:07 - consists of standards guidelines and
164:08 - best practices to manage cyber security
164:10 - related risks then you have like
164:12 - government specific ones so like there's
164:13 - one for canada there's one for all sorts
164:16 - of countries but this is a uk specific
164:18 - one it's called gcloud and it's a cloud
164:20 - computing certification for services
164:22 - used by government entities in the
164:23 - united kingdom and then you have fips so
164:26 - federal information processing standard
164:28 - this is a u.s and canada government
164:29 - standard that specifies the security
164:32 - requirements for cryptographic modules
164:34 - that protect sensitive information
164:36 - [Music]
164:40 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
164:42 - and we're looking at microsoft
164:44 - information protection also known as mip
164:46 - and this is a collection of features
164:48 - within m365 compliance to help you
164:50 - discover classify and protect sensitive
164:52 - information wherever it travels or
164:55 - resides so
164:57 - the idea here is that we have this
164:59 - diagram and we have a four specific
165:02 - domains of
165:03 - things around our data and so the first
165:06 - is know your data the second is protect
165:08 - your data the third is prevent data loss
165:10 - and the fourth is govern your data which
165:13 - will be its own category here is kind of
165:15 - part of it
165:17 - so
165:18 - we'll get into it next okay
165:20 - [Music]
165:24 - all right so let's look at the three of
165:26 - the four domains here for the microsoft
165:28 - information protection these are
165:29 - features
165:31 - found within
165:32 - the microsoft compliance center so the
165:35 - first is know your data understand your
165:36 - data landscape and identify important
165:38 - data across your hybrid environment so
165:40 - one feature would be sensitive
165:42 - information types so identify sensitive
165:44 - data by using built-in or custom regular
165:45 - expressions or a function
165:47 - corroborative evidence includes keywords
165:49 - confidence levels and proximity we have
165:51 - built-in sensitive labels then there's
165:54 - and you have custom ones probably as
165:56 - well yeah so then there's train uh
165:58 - trainable classifiers so these identify
166:00 - sense of data by using examples of the
166:02 - data you're interested in rather than
166:05 - identifying elements in the item so
166:06 - pattern matching and you can use
166:08 - built-in classifiers or train a
166:10 - classifier with your own content so you
166:12 - have trainable classifiers here for data
166:14 - classification this is a graphical
166:16 - identification of items in your
166:18 - organization that have a sensitive label
166:20 - a retention label or have been
166:21 - classified you can also use this
166:23 - information to gain insights into the
166:25 - actions
166:26 - that your users are taking uh taking on
166:29 - these items so that's the content
166:30 - explorer the activity explorer all of
166:33 - these three features we will look at in
166:35 - granular detail okay so don't worry if
166:37 - they don't make sense right now the
166:38 - second part is protect your data so
166:40 - apply flexible protection actions that
166:42 - include encryption access restriction
166:44 - and visual markings so sensitivity
166:46 - labels the azure information protection
166:48 - unified labeling client double key
166:50 - encryption office 365 message encryption
166:54 - uh service encryption with customer key
166:56 - sharepoint information rights management
166:57 - irm rights management connector azure
167:00 - information protection unified labeling
167:02 - scanner microsoft cloud app security
167:05 - microsoft information protection sdk
167:07 - most of these you don't need to know but
167:08 - we will definitely cover sensitivity
167:09 - labels that's for sure then we have
167:11 - prevent data loss so these prevent
167:13 - accidental over sharing of sensitive
167:15 - information so that would be dlps
167:17 - endpoint data loss protection there is a
167:20 - chrome extension that does uh compliance
167:22 - compliance for you so it's built into
167:23 - your browser the m365 data loss
167:26 - prevention for on-premise scanner
167:28 - protection sensitive information in
167:31 - microsoft teams chat channel channels
167:33 - and messages we'll probably look at a
167:35 - more closer look at the last one there
167:36 - okay
167:37 - [Music]
167:41 - all right so out of the
167:43 - four domains the the last one here is
167:46 - for governance
167:47 - and this one particular one is actually
167:48 - more of a subset and so that's why we
167:50 - give it the microsoft information
167:51 - governance title here mig and it is a
167:54 - collection of features to govern your
167:55 - data for compliance or regulatory they
167:57 - have this nice graphic here to kind of
167:59 - show the scope
168:00 - of this here but we'll first talk about
168:02 - information governance so this is
168:03 - retention policies and retention labels
168:05 - import service archive third party data
168:08 - inactive mailboxes and then you have
168:10 - records management this is a single
168:12 - solution for email documents that
168:14 - incorporates retention schedules and
168:15 - requirements in a file plan that
168:17 - supports the full lifecycle of your
168:19 - content with records declaration
168:21 - retention and disposition
168:23 - [Music]
168:27 - so sensitive information types are
168:29 - classifications or categories of data by
168:32 - sensitivity so within the m365
168:34 - compliance data classification feature
168:36 - you can get a breakdown of the
168:38 - distribution of sensitive info types so
168:40 - here imagine you have a bunch of
168:42 - documents and you said hey tell me what
168:44 - you found in these documents and there
168:45 - it gives it kind of a breakdown these
168:47 - types of identified base these are
168:49 - identified based on regular expressions
168:52 - or a function and there's hundreds of
168:54 - built-in uh information types so ip
168:56 - address eu passport number credit card
168:58 - number azure storage account key aba
169:00 - routing number canada health service
169:02 - number latvian driver license number
169:06 - netherlands tax identification number so
169:07 - it's a huge list
169:09 - these are used the sensitive information
169:11 - types are used in data loss retention so
169:13 - dlp policies sensitive labels retention
169:16 - labels insider risk management
169:18 - communication compliance auto labeling
169:20 - policies generally the first thing
169:22 - you're going to do with your data
169:23 - classification is get your sensitive
169:25 - information types okay and you can
169:27 - create your own too so if there's
169:28 - something that doesn't meet your needs
169:29 - you'll have to write your own regular
169:30 - expression but you can have whatever you
169:32 - want okay
169:33 - [Music]
169:37 - another feature found in data
169:38 - classification within the
169:40 - m365 compliance center are trainable
169:42 - classifiers let's talk about what
169:44 - training is and classifiers are so a
169:46 - classifier is a machine learning model
169:48 - that can take records of data and
169:50 - classify categorize by applying a label
169:53 - from a predetermined list of categories
169:56 - then you have training and this is the
169:57 - active teaching and machine learning
169:59 - model how to learn by providing it large
170:01 - amounts of data that is already labeled
170:03 - it uses the labeled data to tell if its
170:05 - predictions are similar to the ones
170:07 - provided so within m365 compliance
170:09 - center there are two kinds of trainable
170:10 - classifiers
170:12 - pre-trained classifiers so ready to use
170:14 - classifiers with five pre-trained
170:16 - classifiers we'll talk about those five
170:17 - in a moment you don't need to provide
170:19 - any data used for training meets any
170:21 - general use cases and you have custom
170:23 - trainable classifiers when you have your
170:25 - own kind of documents when you have
170:27 - specific business requirements
170:29 - but you'll have to provide the training
170:30 - data so the five are resumes source code
170:33 - harassment profanity and threat so here
170:36 - they are in the actual
170:37 - service itself okay
170:39 - [Music]
170:44 - another feature in the data
170:45 - classification within m365 compliance
170:48 - center is content explorer so this is a
170:50 - drill down to find emails or documents
170:52 - that have been labeled based on
170:53 - sensitive information types sensitivity
170:55 - labels or retention labels so the idea
170:57 - here is you have broad categories on the
171:00 - left-hand side where it says sensitive
171:01 - do you see the three categories
171:02 - information types labels and retention
171:04 - labels let me get out my pen here over
171:06 - here all right and then what you'll do
171:09 - is click into one and then they'll have
171:11 - more
171:12 - or specific
171:15 - actual items underneath and you'd click
171:16 - into one of those and then from there
171:18 - you can go and it's on the right hand
171:20 - pane over here which is this you can go
171:22 - and explore
171:24 - different documents and files to
171:26 - identify that kind of information okay
171:32 - the other explorer here is the activity
171:34 - explorer and this helps discover which
171:36 - file labels were changed and which files
171:38 - were modified so monitors label activity
171:40 - cross exchange sharepoint onedrive
171:42 - endpoint devices so here is a great
171:44 - visual just to get an idea so here you
171:47 - have filter so activity location user
171:50 - the type of filter you want
171:52 - and then you can just see so see it says
171:54 - labeled applied here so you can see that
171:56 - these labels were applied
171:58 - this
171:59 - gray is for files created files copy the
172:02 - cloud is a little orange here uh we have
172:04 - the green false copy to removable media
172:07 - is over here in the green
172:08 - so you get an idea of what this does
172:11 - okay
172:12 - [Music]
172:16 - so sensitivity labels allow you to apply
172:19 - a label to your document or email and
172:21 - the most common way is via built-in
172:23 - drop-downs within office 365 products i
172:25 - actually tried
172:26 - using these but i guess i'd have to do a
172:28 - lot of setup to get these and so i just
172:30 - had to grab
172:33 - previously existing screenshots but
172:35 - here's one for word here's one for excel
172:37 - and here's one from outlook so the idea
172:40 - is that you do do your business as per
172:42 - usual but you'd have to go ahead and
172:44 - classify that information into a
172:46 - particular sensitivity okay
172:49 - so sensitivity labeling makes it easy to
172:51 - apply uh or to do content marketing or
172:54 - encryption so content marketing would be
172:56 - like watermarks or warnings that are
172:57 - applied to the header and footer of a
172:59 - document so notice here you know you
173:01 - turn it on
173:02 - and you can say add this watermark with
173:04 - this customized text add this header add
173:06 - this footer i think you can even
173:08 - customize some of the colors very
173:10 - limited but it does the job okay the
173:12 - other one is encryption so apply
173:13 - encryption and specify which users and
173:15 - groups may decrypt and other fine-tuned
173:18 - permissions so the idea is you would
173:20 - turn the encryption on then you would
173:22 - select the users groups or et cetera who
173:24 - could do it then they have these broad
173:25 - categories and so this
173:28 - particular one is for email but here you
173:30 - can see that you know are you allowed to
173:32 - forward the email are you allowed to
173:33 - reply to the email can you save the
173:35 - email are you allowed to view it so it's
173:37 - very fine-tuned it's not just encryption
173:39 - even though that's what it's called
173:41 - so within the m365 compliance center
173:44 - under classifications you can see the
173:46 - distribution of sensitive labels applied
173:47 - to documents and emails or based on
173:49 - location so this gives you a visual as
173:52 - to understanding like where these labels
173:54 - are
173:54 - so here on the left-hand side is what
173:56 - has been applied and then here is where
173:58 - they are all right
174:00 - so sensitive labels can be used in
174:03 - providing protection settings that
174:05 - include encryption and content markings
174:07 - protect content in office apps across
174:09 - different platforms and devices protect
174:11 - content in third-party apps and services
174:13 - protect containers extend sensitive
174:16 - sensitivity labels to power bi extend
174:19 - sensitivity labels to assets in azure
174:21 - extend sensitivity labels to third-party
174:23 - apps and services and classify content
174:26 - without using any protection settings
174:28 - [Music]
174:32 - let's take a look here at label policies
174:34 - for sensitivity labels so in order to
174:36 - use sensitivity labels they need to be
174:38 - published alongside a label policy so a
174:41 - label policy determines who can use the
174:43 - label and other conditions so the idea
174:45 - is you say okay well
174:47 - which users can
174:49 - use these labels and then here are some
174:51 - of the settings here so notice below i'm
174:53 - going to get my pen out here so users
174:55 - must provide justification to remove a
174:57 - label or lower classification requires
174:59 - user to apply a label to the email or
175:01 - document provides user with a link to a
175:03 - custom help page
175:05 - so choose the users and groups that the
175:08 - label can see so labels can be published
175:10 - to specific users distribution groups
175:13 - m365 groups and azure ad and more so you
175:16 - apply default label a label to all the
175:18 - new emails and documents that can be
175:20 - specified
175:21 - for users and groups to create users can
175:24 - always change the default label if they
175:25 - believe the document or email has been
175:27 - mislabeled require justifications for
175:29 - label changes so if a user wants to
175:31 - remove a label or repeat it admins can
175:34 - require the user to provide a
175:36 - valid justification to complete the
175:38 - action the user will be prompted to
175:40 - provide an explanation for why the label
175:42 - should be changed then we have require
175:44 - user to apply a label some mandatory
175:47 - mandatory labeling it ensures a label is
175:50 - applied before users can save the
175:51 - documents send emails or create new
175:54 - sites or groups and we have link users
175:56 - to custom help pages so it helps users
175:58 - to understand what the different
176:00 - different labels mean and how they
176:02 - should be used
176:03 - [Music]
176:07 - let's take a look at retention labels
176:09 - and retention policies so retention
176:11 - labels ensure data is held for a
176:13 - specific duration to meet a regulatory
176:15 - compliance or industry best practice and
176:18 - retention policies are used to assign
176:20 - the same retention settings to content
176:23 - at the site level or mailbox level and
176:25 - we do have some nice visuals uh there
176:27 - the first one at the top just getting my
176:29 - pen out here top retention labels
176:31 - applied to content and then the
176:33 - locations of those labels not too
176:35 - different from sensitivity labels so we
176:37 - didn't have to spend too much time on it
176:38 - but it's pretty clear you're just
176:39 - holding on to data for a particular
176:41 - amount of time
176:42 - [Music]
176:46 - so what is records management well this
176:48 - is when an organization's process of
176:50 - managing uh their information throughout
176:52 - its life cycle and record management
176:54 - helps organization meet regulatory
176:56 - compliance legal requirements uh so a
176:59 - life cycle of a record would look
177:00 - something like identifying classifying
177:03 - storing securing retrieving tracking
177:06 - destroying and preserving and so a
177:09 - record represents labeled information or
177:11 - content and it's life cycle to be
177:13 - managed so uh
177:15 - within the n365 compliance center you
177:17 - have record management and this enables
177:19 - you to do label content as a record
177:22 - migrating managing retention plans and
177:24 - with file plan manager establishing
177:26 - retention and deletion policies within
177:28 - the record label triggering event-based
177:30 - retention reviewing and validating
177:32 - disposition proof of record deletion
177:34 - exporting information about disposed
177:36 - items setting specific permissions for
177:38 - record manager functions and
177:40 - organizations
177:41 - for
177:42 - label content applies to the following
177:44 - so restrictions are put in place to
177:45 - block certain activities activities are
177:47 - logged proof of disposition is kept at
177:50 - the end of the retention period i could
177:52 - not find any screenshots for this and it
177:54 - was so hard to figure out how to even
177:56 - see it myself so i'm sorry but we're
177:59 - gonna have to deal with text for this
178:00 - okay
178:05 - so within m365 compliance center they
178:08 - have data loss protection dlp policies
178:10 - that prevent data loss so dlp policies
178:12 - allow you to identify and monitor and
178:14 - automatically protect sensitive
178:15 - information m365 help users learn how
178:18 - compliance works view dlp reports glp
178:21 - policies are composed of conditions so
178:24 - these are matching content before the
178:25 - rules enforced actions this is what
178:28 - action to take when the condition is
178:30 - found locations where the policy should
178:32 - be applied all right so not too
178:34 - complicated but there you go
178:35 - [Music]
178:40 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
178:41 - and we're taking a look here at insider
178:43 - risk management and so this is another
178:45 - uh service that's underneath the m365
178:48 - compliance center so insider risk
178:49 - management minimizes internal risks by
178:51 - enabling you to detect investigate and
178:53 - act on malicious and inadvertent
178:55 - activities in your organization so
178:57 - define the types of risk to identifying
178:59 - detecting organization including acting
179:01 - on cases and escalating cases to the
179:03 - microsoft advance e-discovery if needed
179:06 - so inside risk management is looking to
179:08 - detect leaks of sensitive data and data
179:10 - spillage confidentiality violations ip
179:14 - theft fraud insider trading
179:17 - regulatory compliance violations and so
179:20 - over here on the right we have the
179:21 - actual workflow for it and notice it is
179:23 - policy alerts triage investigate action
179:26 - the last three being all tied to an
179:28 - insider risk case and so the features
179:31 - we're going to cover literally maps to
179:33 - this workflow here these five things
179:34 - let's jump into it first looking at
179:36 - policies
179:37 - so policies are predefined templates and
179:39 - policy conditions that define
179:41 - what triggering events and risk
179:42 - indicators are examined in your
179:44 - organization so
179:46 - here's the here's the page itself you
179:48 - see you have warnings recommendations
179:49 - and policies and down below are your
179:51 - defined policies and we can drill down
179:53 - into those uh we'll be able to set
179:55 - alerts on them that's when they're
179:57 - talking about triggering events we're
179:58 - talking about alerts and so that's the
180:00 - next step here so alerts automatically
180:02 - generated by risk indicators that match
180:04 - policy conditions and are displayed in
180:06 - the alerts dashboard and so we can
180:09 - identify the status of an existing
180:11 - alerts and new alerts that need actions
180:13 - such as status severity time detected
180:16 - case and case status so down below
180:18 - you'll see the status the activity sense
180:21 - activity severity the case that it's
180:23 - part of the case status all right
180:25 - because these get grouped into case
180:26 - which we'll talk about here in a moment
180:28 - but if we want to uh dig deeper we can
180:30 - click in any into any of these alerts
180:33 - and this is where we're going to get
180:34 - triage so this allows reviewers uh to
180:37 - see detailed information about the
180:39 - activities identified within a policy
180:41 - and the user activity associated with
180:42 - the policy that was matched so you'll be
180:45 - able to see the severity alert and
180:46 - review the user profile information so
180:48 - it's a bit more information here but
180:50 - what's going to be really useful is
180:52 - actually investigate because that is a
180:53 - holistic view of all the alerts and
180:56 - information that have been tied under a
180:59 - case so the case dashboard provides an
181:01 - all-up view of all active cases open
181:03 - cases over time and case statistics for
181:05 - organization reviewers can quickly
181:07 - filter case by study and the date the
181:09 - case was opened and the date the case
181:11 - was last updated cases are created for
181:14 - alerts that require deeper review and
181:15 - investigation of the activity details
181:17 - and the circumstances around the policy
181:19 - match so the primary investigation tools
181:21 - are user activity activity explorer
181:24 - content explorer and case notes so there
181:27 - you go
181:28 - [Music]
181:33 - another service that's within the m365
181:36 - compliance center there's a lot of them
181:37 - in there is communication compliance and
181:40 - that helps minimize communication risks
181:42 - by helping you detect capture and act on
181:44 - inappropriate messages in your
181:45 - organization so you have predefined and
181:48 - custom policies that allow you to scan
181:49 - internal and external communications for
181:52 - policy matches so they can be examined
181:53 - by designated reviewers reviewers can
181:56 - investigate scanned email microsoft
181:58 - teams yammer or third-party
182:00 - communications in your organization and
182:02 - take appropriate action to make sure
182:03 - they're compliant with your
182:04 - organization's message standards so
182:07 - communication compliance can
182:09 - can scan increasing types of
182:11 - communication channels increasing the
182:13 - volume of message data regulatory
182:14 - enforcement of the risk of fines
182:16 - scenarios of communication compliance
182:18 - could be corporate policies so like
182:20 - acceptable use and ethical standards
182:22 - avoiding harassment or use of
182:23 - inappropriate
182:24 - offensive language then there's risk
182:26 - management so manage potential legal
182:28 - exposure and risk under authorized
182:30 - communications and conflicts of interest
182:32 - about confidential projects such as
182:34 - upcoming acquisitions mergers earnings
182:36 - disclosures reorganizations leader
182:39 - leadership team changes regulatory
182:41 - compliance so supervisory or oversight
182:44 - process of messaging that's
182:46 - inappropriate for the industry
182:48 - regulatory authority
182:50 - this one again it's hard to get
182:52 - screenshots of these services because
182:54 - they all require you to have trial and
182:56 - full information and microsoft was
182:57 - pretty sparse on this but this service
182:59 - does a lot but when you look at it
183:01 - doesn't seem like it does okay so it has
183:03 - this little workflow here where we have
183:05 - configure investigate and then there's
183:06 - the continuous monitoring so we'll
183:08 - quickly go through here so configure is
183:10 - identify your compliance requirements
183:12 - and configure application or applicable
183:14 - communication compliance policies so
183:16 - offensive or threatening language
183:17 - sensitive information regulatory
183:19 - compliance conflict of interest custom
183:21 - policy
183:23 - for investigate issues detected as
183:25 - matching your communication
183:26 - compliance policies alerts issue
183:29 - management document review reviewing
183:30 - user activity history filters so for
183:33 - remediate you have remediate
183:35 - communication compliance issues you've
183:37 - investigated to resolve tag a message
183:39 - notify the user escalate to another
183:41 - reviewer mark as a false positive
183:44 - remove messages in team and escalate for
183:47 - investigation then you have monitor and
183:49 - reports of communication compliance
183:51 - dashboard widgets export logs and event
183:54 - events record in the unified audit logs
183:57 - continually evaluate and improve your
183:58 - compliance posture so there you go
184:00 - that's communication compliance
184:01 - [Music]
184:06 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
184:08 - and we're looking at the concept of
184:09 - information barriers so information
184:10 - barriers are policies that admins can
184:13 - configure to prevent individuals or
184:15 - groups from communicating with each
184:16 - other so information barriers can be
184:18 - applied to microsoft teams onedrive for
184:20 - business sharepoint online and more and
184:22 - information barriers only support
184:23 - two-way restrictions so maybe a use case
184:25 - would be like your school but you don't
184:27 - want one student to see the records of
184:29 - another student or a lawyer cannot
184:31 - obtain client data from another lawyer
184:33 - so you know for microsoft teams
184:35 - information barriers policies can
184:37 - restrict the following searching for a
184:38 - user adding a member to a team starting
184:41 - a chat session with someone and starting
184:44 - with a group chat and inviting someone
184:45 - to join a meeting sharing a screen
184:48 - placing a phone call sharing a file with
184:50 - another user uh access to the file
184:52 - through sharing links so there's a lot
184:54 - of restrictions and that's great for
184:55 - microsoft teams where you do this i
184:57 - think it's in the m365 compliance center
185:00 - i really tried hard to find this but
185:01 - it's just like
185:02 - this course like i can't find anything
185:04 - but it's something you need to know so
185:06 - there you go
185:08 - [Music]
185:12 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
185:13 - and we're taking a look here at
185:14 - privileged access management so it
185:17 - protects your organization from breaches
185:19 - and helps to meet compliance best
185:20 - practices by limiting sand limiting
185:22 - standing access to sensitive data or
185:25 - access to critical configuration
185:26 - settings so this gives you just-in-time
185:28 - access rules uh and there are uh that
185:31 - are implemented for tasks that need of
185:33 - elevated permissions and let an
185:35 - organization operate with zero standing
185:36 - access enabling privileged access
185:39 - management for
185:40 - exchange online in microsoft 365 allows
185:43 - your organization to operate with zero
185:45 - standing privileges and provides a layer
185:47 - of defense against standing
185:49 - administrative access vulnerabilities so
185:51 - here you can create approvers group
185:53 - enable privileged access management
185:55 - create an access policy submit approval
185:58 - privilege access requests and that's all
186:00 - the steps there if you just want to see
186:02 - it there again okay
186:03 - [Music]
186:08 - so customer lockbox protects sensitive
186:10 - data when working with microsoft support
186:12 - engineers by enforcing a request system
186:14 - to view custom private information to
186:16 - resolve an m365 related issue so
186:19 - customer lockbox supports requests to
186:21 - access data for exchange online
186:24 - sharepoint online onedrive for business
186:27 - and you need to turn on customer lock
186:29 - box in order for this uh to work and the
186:31 - support engineer must make an email
186:33 - request and a pr and it must be approved
186:35 - by you before they can access it and the
186:38 - support engineer only has access for the
186:40 - minimum amount of time that they need it
186:42 - for and an audit trail of access is
186:44 - maintained so that way you know if there
186:46 - was tampering stuff that evidence is
186:48 - there so here is an example of a request
186:51 - that is pending your approval so the
186:53 - support engineer is saying hey i need to
186:55 - get into
186:56 - whatever it is and and you say accept or
186:59 - deny okay so there you go
187:02 - [Music]
187:06 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
187:08 - and we're taking a look at e-discovery
187:09 - and this is again another service found
187:12 - within the m365 compliance center
187:15 - so e-discovery stands for electronic
187:18 - electronic discovery and this is the
187:19 - process of identifying and delivering
187:21 - electronic information that can be used
187:23 - as evidence in legal cases so
187:25 - e-discovery tools in m365 to search
187:28 - content in exchange online
187:31 - m365 groups and in teams in sharepoint
187:34 - online onedrive for business sites
187:36 - skype for business conversations yammer
187:38 - teams
187:39 - and so there are two uh options we have
187:42 - core in advance we'll definitely walk
187:44 - through those two but m365 provides the
187:46 - following e-discovery tools so content
187:49 - search core e-discovery advanced
187:51 - e-discovery okay so we will get into
187:54 - these now
187:55 - [Music]
187:59 - so core e-discovery in m365 provides a
188:02 - basic e-discovery tool that
188:04 - organizations can use to search and
188:06 - export content in m365
188:09 - and office 365 so you can use query
188:12 - discovery to place an e-discovery hold
188:14 - on content locations such as your
188:17 - mailboxes sharepoint onedrive and
188:19 - microsoft teams so nothing is needed to
188:21 - deploy query discovery but there are
188:24 - some prerequisites that you have to do
188:26 - before you can complete for your
188:27 - organization okay so those would be
188:30 - things like verifying and assigning
188:31 - appropriate licensing assign e-discovery
188:33 - permissions create a core e-discovery
188:35 - case and then from there
188:37 - you can use the holds the search for
188:40 - content and export and download the
188:41 - search results okay
188:43 - [Music]
188:47 - let's take a closer look here at content
188:49 - search and holds for e-discovery
188:51 - workflows so to perform a content search
188:53 - you can create a new search specify the
188:55 - locations provide keywords and
188:57 - conditions and if you leave the keywords
188:59 - blank it will return all the items and
189:00 - conditions i just want you to notice a
189:03 - few things here you can also search by
189:04 - id list
189:06 - here we have our location so we have
189:07 - exchange point sharepoint exchange i
189:09 - think teams is supposed to show up there
189:11 - i'm not sure why it's not there for my
189:12 - use case you could also search within a
189:14 - hold so you have your keyword you can
189:17 - leave that blank and they have a lot of
189:18 - conditions like i cut this off but it's
189:20 - like super long
189:22 - okay
189:23 - so then we have holds and so the
189:24 - difference here is that a whole will
189:26 - preserve content uh for as long as the
189:29 - hold exists okay
189:31 - and so you are being you're able to
189:33 - basically search the exact same things
189:35 - um with the exception i think yammer
189:37 - groups is added there the con is
189:38 - preserved until you remove the content
189:40 - location from the hold or until you
189:42 - delete the hold after you create an
189:44 - e-discovery hold it may take up to 24
189:46 - hours for the hole to take effect okay
189:48 - [Music]
189:53 - so let's take a look here at advanced
189:54 - e-discovery workflow so this workflow
189:57 - builds on the existing core discovery
189:58 - discovery workflow but it's just a lot
190:00 - more advanced it's an end-to-end
190:01 - workflow to preserve collect review
190:03 - analyze and export content that's
190:05 - relevant to your organization's internal
190:07 - external investigation it also lets your
190:09 - legal teams manage the entire legal hold
190:12 - notification workflow to communicate
190:14 - with custodians involved in a case so
190:16 - the built-in workflow for advanced
190:17 - e-discovery just
190:19 - described below
190:22 - [Music]
190:26 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
190:28 - and we're taking a look here at m365
190:30 - audit so what is an audit well that's an
190:32 - investigation uh into a security event
190:34 - forensic investigation internal
190:36 - investigation or compliance obligation
190:38 - an audit would involve capturing
190:39 - recording retaining unified audit log
190:42 - and uh m365 has two solutions so we have
190:45 - a basic audit so enabled by default
190:47 - thousands of searchable audited events
190:49 - 90-day audit record retention expert
190:51 - audit records to a csv
190:53 - and this tool shows up in the compliance
190:56 - center
190:57 - it also comes with the activity api so
190:59 - it's just a way of interacting with it
191:01 - and you can also use it in powershell
191:03 - with the search unified audit log
191:05 - commandlet then there are is the uh
191:08 - advanced audit so this includes all the
191:09 - base basic features of audit features
191:12 - but it has retention policies longer
191:14 - retention periods high value and crucial
191:17 - events and higher bandwidth to the
191:19 - office 365 management activity api okay
191:23 - [Music]
191:27 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
191:29 - and we're taking a look at resource
191:31 - locks so as an admin you may need to
191:33 - lock a subscription resource group or
191:35 - resource to prevent other users from
191:37 - accidentally deleting or modifying
191:38 - critical resources so this is within
191:41 - azure here i have a resource group
191:43 - and i can set it either to read only and
191:46 - so this will allow the authorized users
191:48 - to
191:49 - who can read a resource but they can't
191:51 - delete or update the resource and then
191:53 - you have the delete so authorized users
191:55 - can still read and modify resource but
191:57 - they can't delete the resource if you
191:59 - notice there's a bit of inconsistency
192:00 - with the naming where i have read only
192:02 - and cannot delete it's because this is
192:03 - what they are in the api and this is
192:05 - what they are in the actual portal okay
192:09 - [Music]
192:13 - let's take a look here at resource tags
192:14 - so a tag is a key and value pair that
192:16 - you can assign to azure resources
192:19 - so it's as simple as a name and a value
192:21 - or a key and a value and so some tag
192:23 - examples could be a department so a
192:26 - status a team an environment a project
192:29 - a location
192:31 - and so tags are really important because
192:32 - they allow you to
192:34 - filter your inventory in a lot of
192:36 - different ways so
192:37 - they allow you to organize based on
192:39 - resource management so specific
192:40 - workloads environments like developer
192:42 - environments maybe cost management and
192:44 - optimization so cost tracking budgets
192:46 - alerts operations management so business
192:48 - commitments sla operations mission uh
192:51 - critical services security which is the
192:53 - one we're interested in for this course
192:56 - so a classification of data and security
192:58 - impact governance and regulatory
192:59 - compliance another one we care about
193:01 - automation workflow automation okay
193:04 - [Music]
193:09 - let's take a look here at azure
193:10 - blueprints and this enables quick
193:12 - creation of governed subscription so you
193:14 - can compose artifacts based on common or
193:16 - organizational based patterns into
193:18 - reusable blueprints the service is
193:20 - designed to help with environment setup
193:22 - so blueprints are a declarative way to
193:24 - orchestrate the deployment of various
193:26 - resource templates and other artifacts
193:28 - such as role assignments policy
193:30 - assignments
193:31 - arm templates resource groups and so
193:33 - azure blueprints service is backed by
193:35 - the globally distributed azure cosmodb
193:38 - and blueprint objects are replicated to
193:40 - multiple azure regions a comparison is
193:43 - between arm templates and blueprints
193:45 - because they appear to do the same thing
193:47 - and so nearly everything you'd want to
193:49 - include for deployment in azure
193:50 - blueprint can be
193:52 - accomplished with an arm template but
193:54 - with arm templates they are stored
193:56 - either locally or in source control
193:57 - there's no active connection or
193:59 - relationship to the arm template but
194:00 - with blueprints
194:02 - the relationship between the blueprint
194:04 - definition what should be deployed in
194:05 - the blueprint assignment what was
194:07 - deployed
194:08 - is a huge um advantage here especially
194:11 - if you are care about this from the
194:13 - sense of compliance or security because
194:15 - then we have the exact idea what is
194:17 - going on with their stuff so you can
194:18 - also upgrade several subscriptions at
194:20 - once that are governed by the same
194:21 - blueprint so azure blueprint supports
194:24 - improved tracking and auditing of
194:25 - deployment so that is the difference
194:27 - there okay
194:28 - [Music]
194:32 - so azure policies enforces
194:34 - organizational standards to assess
194:36 - compliance at scale and policies do not
194:39 - restrict access but they only observe
194:41 - for compliance so here's a list of
194:43 - built-in policies that you use right
194:46 - away and if you can squint here i know
194:48 - it's a small screenshot but do we see
194:50 - fedramp nist things like that and notice
194:53 - that they map over to they might map
194:54 - over to specific services or maybe it's
194:57 - regulatory compliance it's going to vary
194:59 - for that stuff okay
195:01 - so the idea is that a policy is actually
195:03 - just a policy definition and this is
195:05 - just a json file users describe business
195:07 - rules to control access resources you
195:09 - have policy assignments so this is the
195:11 - scope of a policy
195:12 - effect so it can be assigned to a user
195:15 - resource group or management group then
195:16 - you have policy parameters these are
195:18 - values you can pass into a policy
195:20 - definition
195:21 - or so or or your policies are flexible
195:24 - for reuse then you have initiative
195:26 - definitions this is an initial
195:28 - definition is a collection of policy
195:29 - definitions that can assign so let's say
195:32 - you want a group of policies to enforce
195:33 - pci
195:34 - dss compliance so notice here the reason
195:37 - i have that arrows because we're looking
195:38 - at whoops we're looking at the policy
195:39 - type over here so that's just these are
195:41 - all just one policy definition files
195:44 - each of these are a single file and then
195:46 - the initiatives over here these are a
195:48 - collection okay
195:50 - now in terms of viewing non-compliant
195:51 - resources once the policy is assigned it
195:53 - will evaluate for the compliance state
195:55 - periodically so here you can see that we
195:58 - have a compliance tab
196:00 - and in this particular case this is the
196:03 - policy that we uh have here and we can
196:05 - see that it's not being compliant okay
196:07 - so it's not super complicated but there
196:09 - you go
196:09 - [Music]
196:14 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
196:16 - and we're taking a look here at the
196:17 - microsoft cloud adoption framework for
196:19 - azure and the idea behind this white
196:22 - paper and i call it a white paper
196:23 - because that's what it is even if it's
196:24 - in this kind of website format but it's
196:27 - here to help organizations
196:32 - utilize a step-by-step process
196:35 - to migrate their workloads over to azure
196:38 - so if you scroll on down here i mean
196:40 - they describe all these uh categories
196:42 - here but this is the visual here so the
196:44 - idea is you're going to define a
196:45 - strategy you're going to create a plan
196:48 - you're going to get ready so ready would
196:50 - be setting up a landing zone then you'd
196:53 - have to adopt either by migrating or
196:55 - innovating and then up between these
196:57 - steps you're gonna govern and manage so
196:59 - where does security fit in this well on
197:01 - the left-hand side you'll notice there's
197:03 - a whole section it's weird that it
197:04 - doesn't show up in here but there's a
197:06 - whole section on security and so there's
197:09 - security and governance and that's
197:10 - generally what we're interested in but
197:12 - we just click into the secure section uh
197:15 - you can see here
197:17 - uh it talks about uh things in the
197:19 - security disciplines like risk insights
197:22 - security integrations business
197:23 - resilience and then the security
197:25 - disciplines that we need to have if you
197:27 - scroll on down and this is what i found
197:29 - the most useful is that this particular
197:31 - graph kind of shows you the type of
197:32 - roles uh in your community that you're
197:34 - gonna need so like uh when in the plan
197:37 - stage like who you're gonna need in your
197:38 - team in order to fulfill this to the end
197:41 - right so i guess you could say security
197:44 - happens throughout the entire
197:47 - cloud.option framework but
197:50 - yeah you're just going to need different
197:51 - kinds of people to help you for
197:52 - different sections okay
197:54 - they do emphasize on three things like
197:56 - the xero trust uh model which we all
197:58 - know about uh i don't know what open
198:00 - group is the security disciplines map
198:02 - closely to the zero trust components in
198:04 - the core principles white paper uh
198:06 - published by the open group where
198:07 - microsoft actively participates okay so
198:10 - it's based it's basically a white paper
198:12 - another white paper
198:14 - uh that is just more about uh zero trust
198:16 - models other than this cyber security
198:18 - framework which is a pretty standardized
198:20 - framework uh used across the board for
198:22 - all csps so you know um you just need to
198:25 - know what the cloud adoption framework
198:27 - is it is uh pretty useful to go through
198:29 - and read this but there's a lot of stuff
198:31 - okay and so we've covered a lot of this
198:33 - in the course so um you know it's up to
198:35 - you if you want to do it it's definitely
198:37 - an auxiliary read but there you go
198:40 - [Music]
198:45 - hey this is andrew brown from exam pro
198:47 - and we're taking a look here at the
198:48 - azure well architecture framework and
198:50 - this describes the best practices for
198:52 - building workloads on azure categorized
198:54 - into five pillars so we have cost
198:55 - optimization operational excellence
198:57 - performance efficiency reliability and
199:00 - security uh if you've ever seen the aws
199:02 - well well-arcaded framework it's pretty
199:04 - similar like the pillars are one-to-one
199:07 - okay so cost optimization is managing
199:09 - costs to maximize the value delivered
199:12 - operation processes that keep a system
199:14 - running in production the ability of the
199:15 - system to adapt changes in the load uh
199:18 - reliability the ability of a system to
199:19 - recover from failures and continue to
199:21 - function and the last pillar security
199:23 - protecting applications and data from
199:25 - threats
199:26 - so for the topics covered security
199:28 - pillar we have role of security security
199:31 - design principles regulatory compliance
199:33 - reduce organizational risk
199:35 - administration application services
199:37 - government risk and compliance identity
199:38 - access management network security and
199:41 - containment security operations and
199:43 - there's a lot in here and i actually
199:45 - went through all of these categories and
199:47 - i did summaries on them uh but like it's
199:50 - just not fun to read through all this
199:52 - stuff and i don't feel that uh the
199:54 - course is gonna test you on it but i
199:55 - just wanted to show you that i actually
199:56 - did do it i went through it all um and
199:59 - so you know maybe i'll include these in
200:01 - the downloadable um lecture notes so if
200:04 - you do want to go through it and you
200:06 - just want a quick summary of all these
200:07 - categories but i just went through it to
200:09 - see if there was something that seemed
200:10 - really really
200:12 - unnecessary
200:13 - but you know it's just it's just
200:15 - information overload so i'm not going to
200:17 - read through all this because we'd be
200:19 - here for like 15-20 minutes uh but i
200:21 - just wanted to know that that resource
200:22 - is available to you and you might want
200:24 - to just skim through it to you know get
200:26 - a
200:26 - general sense of security in azure okay
200:29 - [Music]
200:33 - so the microsoft security best practices
200:36 - is a collection of best practices that
200:37 - provide clear actionable guidance for
200:39 - security-related decisions this was
200:40 - previously known as the azure security
200:42 - compass and so uh the best practices are
200:45 - packaged into a series of videos or you
200:47 - can download the powerpoint slides and
200:49 - so the pro the best practice covers the
200:51 - following governance risk compliance
200:52 - security operations identity and access
200:54 - management
200:55 - network security containment
200:57 - information protection and storage
200:59 - application services and this is about
201:02 - 150 slides now the videos are pretty
201:04 - dull i wouldn't watch them but the
201:05 - slides are amazing and i'm definitely
201:07 - going to show you after this video we're
201:09 - gonna go take a peek at that uh uh
201:11 - slideshow uh but you know there there's
201:13 - the best practices the well architect
201:15 - framework the cloud adoption framework
201:16 - there's a lot of coverage that's in the
201:18 - same place i feel that this one this
201:21 - particular resource should have been on
201:23 - the exam guide
201:25 - but anyway i'm going to show it to you
201:26 - because you're just going to see you're
201:27 - going to go wow i'm going to spend some
201:28 - time reading here and it's going to
201:30 - probably help you solidify all the
201:31 - knowledge you've learned in this course
201:33 - okay
201:36 - [Music]
201:38 - all right so what i did here is i just
201:39 - typed in microsoft security best
201:41 - practices and below you can see that
201:43 - there's these guidance if you click into
201:44 - them here's all the videos
201:47 - it would take forever to watch these
201:48 - things and they're really padded out
201:50 - they're just talking way too much
201:52 - but you know if you're looking to dive
201:54 - in a particular section you can go in
201:55 - there and check it out really good
201:57 - auxiliary resource for this course but i
201:59 - do cover everything so it's not
202:00 - necessary but if you're interested you
202:02 - should do it
202:03 - here you have a downloadable
202:05 - presentational slide that is what i did
202:06 - here i just want to show you
202:09 - how much they've done in this this is
202:10 - crazy like you go through it and so a
202:13 - lot of stuff we covered right but they
202:15 - just have really great visuals for the
202:17 - stuff
202:18 - and even stuff that we didn't covered so
202:20 - but there's like a lot of slides like
202:21 - i'm just going to click through here
202:22 - just to show you what i'm talking about
202:24 - a lot of these show up like you know the
202:26 - responsibility model we covered that uh
202:28 - these things i think i saw them in the
202:30 - cloud adoption framework so they're
202:32 - really pulling resources everywhere and
202:34 - creating very strong visuals for it uh
202:37 - but again you know it's a little bit
202:39 - overkill um for um you know if this was
202:42 - the the main study course material but
202:45 - yeah just browse through it and see what
202:47 - interests you okay
202:48 - [Music]
202:52 - hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and
202:54 - we're taking a look here at shared
202:55 - access signatures so sas is a url that
202:58 - grants restricted access rights to azure
203:01 - storage the share uh
203:03 - you can share the uri to grant client
203:05 - temporary access to specific set of
203:07 - permissions so you have a few different
203:09 - types of access signatures so account
203:11 - level sas so access to resources in one
203:13 - or more of the storage services service
203:16 - level sas so access to the single
203:18 - storage account by using the storage
203:20 - account key user delegated sas
203:22 - these are access to storage accounts
203:24 - using azure 80 credentials limited only
203:27 - to blob and containers microsoft
203:29 - considers this method the best practice
203:31 - for accessing via the sas so you know
203:33 - you use that one if that's the case
203:36 - a shared access signature comes in
203:37 - different formats so you have ad hoc sas
203:40 - the start time expiry time
203:42 - permissions are part of the uri
203:44 - any type of sas can be an ad hoc sas
203:47 - then you have service sas with stored
203:49 - access policies a stored access policy
203:51 - is defined on a resource container
203:53 - limited to the blob container table
203:55 - queues or file shares the stored access
203:57 - policy can be associated to multiple sas
204:00 - to manage constraints i know all these
204:02 - options seem really confusing but that's
204:03 - just what it is it's a lot more clear
204:05 - when you use it because you're just
204:06 - checkboxing stuff right
204:08 - um so the uri format itself is the blob
204:10 - your eye then there's the version number
204:13 - the start time the expiration the
204:15 - storage resources the permissions the
204:16 - signature they're not going to ask you
204:18 - to identify this stuff on the exam i'm
204:20 - just showing you the structure of it
204:21 - because it's a really long string and
204:22 - it's good to know what it looks like and
204:24 - yeah this is all those check boxes i'm
204:26 - talking about so you just go in here and
204:28 - you say i want to generate out a
204:30 - an sas you say what do i want it for
204:32 - what are the resource types what's the
204:34 - lab permissions what's the time frame
204:37 - what protocol do i want do i want
204:38 - particular ips you have your signing key
204:41 - and you generate it and it's that simple
204:43 - [Music]
204:48 - so let's take a look here at cores which
204:50 - stands for cross origin resource sharing
204:53 - it is an http header based mechanism
204:55 - that allows a server to indicate any
204:57 - other origins so whether it be a domain
204:59 - a scheme a report that it's owned from
205:02 - which a browser should permit loading of
205:04 - resources so you have a website and on
205:06 - your website you're going to have a
205:08 - piece of content so maybe it is a
205:10 - embedded script and so the thing is
205:12 - where does that script originate from so
205:14 - if it's from the same domain that's con
205:17 - then it's going to be of same origin as
205:20 - the server now you could also embed
205:22 - let's say an image and that image could
205:23 - come from a different domain and now
205:25 - it's technically cross origin and so
205:28 - unless you permit it using a special
205:30 - header such as access control allowed
205:32 - origin it would be automatically blocked
205:34 - because it's there to protect you right
205:36 - so cores restricts which websites may
205:38 - access data to be loaded onto a page and
205:41 - so the way it does that is through http
205:42 - headers so you'll have request headers
205:45 - like origin or access control request
205:48 - method
205:49 - request headers and for response you'd
205:51 - have access control allowed origin
205:54 - credentials headers max age allowed
205:57 - methods and headers the ones we see most
205:59 - common
206:01 - it'll be
206:02 - this one here the origin so where are
206:04 - you from i'm from domain one and then
206:06 - for the headers it would be like what do
206:08 - you want to allow so here it's a wild
206:10 - card but you could put in uh uh like
206:13 - wild card and then a domain name you
206:15 - could put multiple domain names in there
206:16 - to say these are the ones that are
206:18 - allowed to embed things on my website or
206:20 - be able to be loaded on my particular
206:22 - website and you have methods that's a
206:24 - very common one like is it allowed to do
206:25 - get post put
206:27 - patch
206:29 - options stuff like that okay
206:35 - let's take a look here at the microsoft
206:37 - security development life cycle the sdl
206:40 - and so this is an industry-leading
206:41 - software security assurance process and
206:43 - it's a microsoft wide initiative and a
206:45 - mandatory process since 2004 the sdl has
206:48 - played a critical role in betting
206:50 - security and privacy in microsoft
206:52 - software and culture so building
206:53 - security into each stl phase of
206:56 - development lifecycle helps you catch
206:58 - issues earlier and it helps you reduce
207:00 - your developer development cost so this
207:02 - is all about pushing left we talked that
207:04 - in security it means doing things a lot
207:06 - earlier and so it has the face the
207:08 - phases of training requirements design
207:10 - implementation verification release
207:12 - response probably won't show up your
207:14 - exam but like you should know what stls
207:16 - are we're talking about security so i
207:17 - had included in here okay

Cleaned transcript:

hey this is andrew brown your cloud instructor at exam pro and i'm bringing you another complete study course and this time it's the microsoft security compliance and identity fundamentals made available to you here on freecodecamp so this course is designed to help you pass and achieve microsoft issued certification and the way we're going to do that is via lots of lecture content and cheat sheets so on the day your exam you have a high chance of passing so you can put that certification on your resume or linkedin to prove you have that azure security knowledge and get that cloud job or that promotion you've been looking for so just a bit about me i'm previously the cto of multiple ed tech companies with 15 years industry experience five years specializing cloud i'm an aws community hero i've published many many free cloud uh courses just like this one and i love star trek and coconut water so if you ever meet me and know what to buy me for a drink i just want to take a moment here to say thank you to viewers like you because it's you that make these cloud courses possible if you're looking for ways to support more free cloud courses just like this one the best way to do that is to buy our additional study materials at exam pro dot co for this course in particular it's forward slash sc900 and here you're going to get study notes flash cards quizlets downloadable lectures downloadable cheat sheets uh practice exams and you can even ask questions and get some learning support if you want to know what courses are coming up next uh the best way is to follow me on twitter i love hearing when people have passed their exam or what you want to see next for a free cloud certification course so there we go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are at the start of our journey asking the most important question which is what is the sc900 so it's the microsoft security compliance and identity fundamentals and it provides broad knowledge across microsoft security services so the certification will demonstrate a person can define and understand the xero trust model microsoft privacy m365 defender and azure defender azure active directory and a broad overview of microsoft and m365 security services and the certification is generally referred to by its course code the sc900 and it's an essential certification no matter your azure path this course in particular is very lecture heavy and greatly involves azure active directory so that is something we can look forward to this isn't an easy course to pass and they're great for those new to security and compliance so here's my azure roadmap and there's a lot more azure certifications but we just kept the ones on the board that actually are relevant to our possible paths and so here is some suggestions i have for you and the first thing is that you definitely want to take the ac 900 first the sc900 while being a fundamental certification is much longer than these other ones and how it has a lot of information so it makes it a little bit more digestible if you take the az900 first if you're taking a general pass such as the administrator developer onto your solutions architect or devops engineer this is going to really make it easier at the associate and expert level especially for the administrator because this particular certification has a lot to do with azure active directory now of course the security certifications should be the primary reason why you want to take this path and azure has four at the associate level this is the reason why we don't really do any lab content follow alongs within the fundamental course because if we did we'd just be making these courses because if you were to look into the exam guides for all these four certifications you're just going to be seeing the same information but us applying that knowledge and saying okay how do we do this for real okay so how long does it take to sta how long should you study to pass a certification well if you have one years of azure experience you're looking about six hours if you've passed your az 900 you're looking about 12 hours if you're completely new so you're not taking the a900 going straight for it you're looking at 20 hours okay this one is a longer than any of the other fundamental certifications and i recommend about 30 minutes a day for 14 days all right just keep it within the scope of two weeks if you can so where do you take this exam well you can do it in person at a test center or online from the convenience of your own home so there are two different uh data test centers that are partnered with uh microsoft and azure to uh deliver these the one is psi or pearson vue they both have in person and online uh i strongly recommend that you always do in person because it's a more controlled environment it's less stressful you don't have to worry about the internet going out uh or some other issue that might occur and so these are proctored exams that means that there's a supervisor somebody monitoring your progress as you take the certification so that you aren't cheating or things like that so what does it take to pass this exam well you got to watch the lecture videos you generally have to do handson labs for this one i'm going to cross this out because basically there's next to none in this course so uh you know it's more so watching the lecture videos you probably would like to get some paid online practice exams and if you do need one go to exampro.com and that's a great way to support these free courses that's how i'm able to make these for you at no cost okay for the content outline uh the breakdown is describe the concepts of security compliance and identity describe the capabilities of microsoft identity and access management solutions describe the capabilities of microsoft security solutions describe the capabilities of the microsoft compliant solutions and we will open up the exam guide in the next video here just to give you a more clear view what the contents of the course is for grading you have to get at least 70 percent to pass so around that because it's using scaled scoring the response types uh we're looking at here well first of all there's 40 to 60 questions so you can get about 12 to 18 questions wrong some questions are worth more than one points there is no penalty for wrong questions some questions cannot be skipped and the format of questions could be multiple choice multiple answer drag and drop hot area or case studies the duration of the course just like all the fundamental certifications is one hour so you roughly get about a minute per question uh the exam time is 60 minutes but your seat time is 90 minutes so your seat time refers to the amount of time you should allocate for the exam so this could include the time to review instructions read and accept the nda complete the exam provide feedback at the end and this certification well i normally say two two years because that's pretty much the standard but any fundamental certification just never expires and i i didn't put this in my other fundamental videos because i did not know that but apparently once you have it you have it forever so that's a pretty good benefit there so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and what i've done here is opened up the page where we can find the exam guide outline so if you type in sc900 certification it should bring it to this page you scroll on down to your skills measured and you download the outline now at the top of these documents this is a very new certification it's not even a year old from the time i'm making this but a lot of times you'll see red text in this document the top you'll say there has been changes it scares people because they think that maybe the course is out of date but i'm going to tell you that unless they change the number here unless it becomes the sc901 or 902 this course is going to be mostly relevant okay because they're only ever making my new changes they're never going to change huge sections of a course if they do then they're going to update the numbers so that's how you know whether my course is still relevant or not okay is whether the course number changes not if there's red text but going down below here we'll just quickly go through some of these sections and some of the thoughts i have about this course so we have the zero trust methodology is the first thing they want to learn xero trust model is super important it's the foundation of this entire course and ties over to azure active directory so you're definitely going to know that inside and out the shared responsibility model which we covered in the az900 nothing has changed there defense and depth that's like a sevenlayer thing not super important common threats which are going to lay the foundation for some other services um encryption which is pretty straightforward stuff we covered in the az104 the microsoft privacy principles this is a bit confusing because they have two different pages but i cover both of them here so you know both of them the service trust portal where we can download audit reports so that's a very simple thing there primary security perimeter this is a concept of the zero trust model really should be up in the top section there author authentication authorization ipd so identity providers think facebook google linkedin twitter uh active directory which is a huge component of this course federated services identity attacks uh and so then we have um the notice here it says service identities for azure id capabilities of azure id management capabilities of azure id identity protection and governance capabilities of azure id so there's a lot of azure ad stuff a good chunk of this is actually covered in the az104 so if you're taking that as your natural path like basically like half of this at least half of this is covered is actually the content's coming from there okay so that's going to be really great for you going down below here now we're into microsoft capability i guess still says azure so nsgs ddos azure firewall bastion web application firewall azure azure encryption data a lot of this covered again in the az104 so it was very easy easy for me to bring this over simplified it more to a business use case for you okay the azure security center azure security score azure defender cloud security posture management and there's a lot of these terms uh like a lot of initialisms and we go thoroughly through them in the primer i actually squeezed in a primer a security primer in the front of this course because uh they just lack a lot of that information to uh help you understand the stuff and so i just did that to round out the entire course overall so you have azure sentinel where you have siem soars and xtr's then there's microsoft 365 defender and there's a lot of stuff with defender because there's azure defender and 365 defender and there's all these sub services there's unbelievable amount of stuff in here so identity office 365 endpoints cloud app security uh then you have the microsoft 365 security center so you have a security score there reports dashboards things like that that's actually how you access azure azure defenders through the m365 or sorry through the um uh security center um and then through uh um at my m365 defender it's through uh well actually just go to the security panel that's how you get to it you have microsoft intune that's for managing remote devices that's part of microsoft endpoint manager so you can remotely control or or have security over devices tablets and computers then we have here um uh the microsoft compliant solution so there's the microsoft um or m365 compliance center and there's a ton of stuff in this course like tons and tons i would say like a good quarter of this entire well it says 25 percent here but 25 percent of the course is all about the compliance center there's tons of stuff in here for that and actually that's the end of the course so yeah it's mostly azure id and the compliance center a handful of azure uh services and a bunch of marketing resources okay so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are starting our journey for the sc900 talking about zero trust methodologies or the zero trust model in particular and this is super important because it really lays the foundation of the way we should be thinking about uh all of the security that we're gonna be doing within azure and actually in any cloud service providers because the xero trust model is really uh what is being adopted today and we'll talk about why that is so the zero trust model operates on the principles of trust no one and verify everything so you have malicious actors and they're being able to bypass conventional access controls and demonstrates traditional security measures that's no longer sufficient we need to come up with a new way to protect ourselves and so that's where azure or microsoft in particular has come up with their version of a zero trust model called the microsoft's zero trust model and this is based on three principles and six pillars so in the three principles we have verified explicitly uh least privileged access assume breach for our six pillars we have um identities endpoints uh an easier way of thinking about endpoints is just think of them as devices apps data infrastructure and networks and i would say that if you wanted to put an emphasis on anything it's going to be identities which comes down to azure ad that seems to be the largest focus here in this entire course and to really ensuring the zero trust methodology works the xerotrust model is not unique to microsoft gcp has its own zero trust model aws has its own zero trust model but the one here is just gonna really work for azure okay okay so let's review the three principles we said that are in the microsoft zero truss model the first is verify explicity and so this always authenticates and authorizes based on all the available data points um the next one is lease privilege access so limit user access with just in time and just enough access for riskbased adaptive policies and data protection assume breach so minimize blast radius and segment access verify endtoend encryption and use analytics to gain visibility drive threat detection improve defenses now you see me highlighting things in red and i'm not telling you what they are because we have a whole section on these things so don't worry if you see a bunch of terms and you're just getting overwhelmed uh we're going to cover them multiple times and so you just understand that we're going to front load you with a lot of terms you don't know but you will know them by the end this course okay all right so let's take a look here at the six pillars for the microsoft zero trust model starting with the most important one identities and this verifies and secures each identity with strong authentication across your entire digital estate and so for each of these pillars we're going to talk about some of the related services i'm not going to describe what they do because we're definitely going to be covering them all in this course in great detail but i want you to get some exposure so you see all these names again and again and again okay so the first is iam the next one is azure active directory and this one gets a lot of attention in this course they might as well call this the azure active directory security course we have single signon mfa password list authentication which is a subset of mfa riskbased policies identity secure score and you'll see like three different types of secure score in this course so something that is very useful uh throughout microsoft and azure we have endpoints and it's easy to think of these as devices because their endpoints are used to gain visibility into devices accessing the network ensuring compliance and health status before granting access the endpoint is what grants access for this we have azure ad device manager to register our devices with our identity provider generally the the controls underneath which is mobile device management and mobile application management is managed by intune and this service is now actually part of microsoft endpoint manager and if we want to get a protection around our endpoints then we have microsoft defender for endpoints but we got defender for everything in this course and you'll see that soon enough then you have dlps uh so data loss prevention policies so we do not lose our data so that we like it does not just get disclosed and we can keep our data our sensitive data protected right for apps we have discover shadow i.t so ensure appropriate inapp permissions gate access based on realtime analytics and monitor control user actions so there for this we have policy based access controls we can use the microsoft cloud app security azure 80 application proxy cloud discovery or i suppose that could have been ediscovery uh there's definitely a spelling mistake there so i think it's just supposed to be cloud discovery um we have just in time virtual machine access onto the last three pillars we have data so move from perimeterbased data protection to data driven protection use intelligence to classify and label data encrypt and restrict access based on organizational pro policies so here we can use sensitive sensitivity labels microsoft information protection data classification azure uh information protection so aip scanner decisionbased policies and data loss prevention all of this stuff is in the microsoft at the if you're doing it on the microsoft side it's the m3s can i type text in here no i can't but it's the m365 compliance center this is where all this stuff comes into play uh we'll see later on so infrastructure used telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies automatically block and flag risk behaviors and employ least privileged access principles so here we can use the azure security center azure ad managed identities user and resource segmentation vnets peering rules privileged identity management nsgs asgs azure firewall microsoft defender for endpoint microsoft defender for identity azure sentinel and the last one here is network i hate doing networking but it's a core to cloud you know so ensure devices and users aren't trusted just because they're on an internal network encrypt all internal communications limit access by policy and employ micro segmentation realtime threat detection so here we can do network segmentation azure ddos production service azure firewall the laugh vpn's proxies bastions ssl tls and so there you go that is all the pillars so we just defined what the zero trust uh model is and that's fine and dandy but how do we go ahead and start implementing it well they have a nice tool that can get us started here called uh the zero trust assessment tool and this is a free tool to assess your organization's degree of adoption towards the zero trust model and suggest uh to improve your current security implementations so it's basically a bunch of questions across the six pillars and then it'll give you a recommendations now we just ran over the six pillars and i actually went through this and extracted them all out for you so you basically just saw all them from the tool um but uh if you want to uh see more detailed steps uh that will be really useful okay i wanted to take a moment to actually show you the assessment tool because it's really easy to use you don't even need an account so all i did was i typed in zero trust assessment tool microsoft and i was brought to here and what the what you want to do here is just start at the beginning and we have identities and lasted some questions like have you enabled mfa authentication for internal users so i'll say some users because some of my users might not be good about it which forms of password list authentication are enabled so password list means you don't have to enter a password in so maybe we have phone call text phone microsoft authenticator i definitely use 502 security keys we'll go next which of your user groups are provisioned with single signon and like does anyone use it so maybe my customers are using single signon which of the following security policy engines are you using to make access decisions for enterprise resources and if you don't know any of these names and you wouldn't check box them i know mobile device management so we'll do that have you disabled legacy authentication i'm not sure what they mean here but maybe you have like an old system that's not part of you're not using azure id so we'd say yeah maybe i'm still using a legacy system i haven't migrated to the cloud yet are you using realtime user and sign in risk detection to evaluate request access if you're using azure id and you have it turned on you'd know but we'll say no for using a legacy system what's the following technologies have you integrated with your identity access management solution if you're again a small company you might have not done much or maybe you've only done mobile device management that's usually one that's pretty common which of the following context is used for access policies um so like access policies like access to things so what is the context and i would say most people are going to be doing the user like what user's allowed to use it and a lot of these are never ever thought about so we'll go next are you using identity security score for guidance um actually i do but let's just say you said no and so the idea here is we'll get our results and it will give you like instructions so this is where i extracted all these little details for you in the slides there so you have to go through it but it describes it multifactor helps you protect your applications by requiring requiring users to confirm the identity etc etc so explains them all right you could just answer no on everything it'll give you all the information at the end and it's very useful to read through this and and uh to understand it but again we cover this through the whole course so you don't have to read it here you just got to follow along okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at azure's shared responsibility model all the cloud service providers have a shared responsibility model they're more or less the same and so this is just to tell you like what you are responsible for what azure is responsible for this is covered in the az104 the az204 and the az900 and definitely we need to cover this again even if you know it we should go over it again for the sc900 so that we can think of it in the context of security so for responsibilities we have information data devices account identities identity directories applications network controls operating system physical host physical network physical data center and then we have saas paas iaas and on premise if you forget those terms the first is software as a service the software that uses that you use in the cloud so think 365. so word doc excel skype uh onedrive sharepoint dynamics crm you know if if imagine just allpurpose software but you access it via the cloud then you have platform as a service so deploy apps without worrying about the underlying infrastructure so azure app services you just have an app you put it up there it just works infrastructure is a service so the basic building blocks of cloud i.t so storage compute database is networking i call that the four uh you should always know that no matter what cloud service provider you're using on premise so data center owned and operated maintained by the customer so we'll do is just show you the blocks here and the blue represents the customer's responsibility okay i i know it's like you think like blue would be for azure but they made it blue and i should have really i should have really um uh put a legend on this because i always get confused by that as well but we're going to just do that and this is the customer okay so going down below here look at physical host networks and data center so azure is going to take responsibility if you're using ias paas or sas azure takes responsibility for all the physical stuff and there's a lot of work there if you had to secure that stuff now once you get you go up a bit more so if you're using an operating system at the pass or sas level you're still responsible or sir azure will take more responsibility here um but you know that's generally broadly how this works but if we just kind of break it down into three major categories i'm just going to clear our board here it's getting a little bit messy so and this this lines up to these lines i just didn't have lines in here but the idea here is this this is always the responsibility of the customer everything above here this is going to vary per service type the second tier and the bottom there the sp responsibility transfers by the cloud providers okay a few caveats here is that regardless of the type of deployment the following response responsibilities are always retained by you so data endpoints account access management so just remember those four there at the end okay let's take a look here at defense and depth and so there are seven layers of security that azure wants you to know it kind of maps up to the shared responsibility model a lot of times we see these things when um organizations or or cloud providers are talking about their security centers like the actual data centers and how they're secured but this is more general it doesn't necessarily have to apply to a data center but let's go and work our way through inside out okay so the core we have data so access to business and customer data encryption to protect our data then we have applications so um applications secure and free of security vulnerabilities then you have compute so access to vms ports on premise and cloud the network limit communications between resources using segmentation and access controls the perimeter so distribute denials of service protection to filter large scale attacks before they can cause the denial service for users identity and access so control controlling access to infrastructure and change controls and then you have physical security so limiting access to a data center to only authorize personnel so the idea is that if you really want to like if you want to get to data you got to go through all these steps here these are all the layers of defense um and so i just want to give extra emphasis to um this one here identity and access because this one's like the besides the physical security this one's the outermost one so they they will say like your your your perimeter like the modern perimeter is defined based on your i like your identity okay and we'll see that more here in this course hey it's andrew brown from exam bro we're looking at the cia triad and that stands for confidentiality integrity and availability and this model is used for describing the foundation to security principles and their tradeoffs and relationships uh and so just to look at it here quickly so we have confidentiality so is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers and practices can be using cryptographic keys to encrypt our data and using keys to encrypt our keys so known as envelope encryption you have integrity so maintaining ensuring the accuracy and completeness of your data over its entire life cycle and practice utilizing asset compliant databases for valid transactions utilizing tamper tamper evident or tamper proof uh hardware security modules so hsms or availability information needs to be made available when needed so in practice you want things to be highly available you want to mitigate ddos attacks you want to uh have decryption access that looks like there's a spell of mistake here something looks funny there but um the ca model was or triad was first mentioned in the nist publication in 1977 uh there have been efforts to expand and modernize or suggest alternatives to the cia triad because it is really old right so one was like in 1998 where we have the six atomic elements of information so confidence confidentiality possession integrity authentication availability utility and then 2004 we have this engineering principles for information technology security um and they that that has like 33 security principles so um the thing with this triad is that you kind of get like a tradeoff they say like if you go in full confidentiality you might have to make compromises here or there um to what degree i don't know but this is a very wellknown model and so it's just good for you to note okay let's talk about common threats and these are in particular what azure wants you to know there's definitely a lot more than just four here but these are the four main ones that azure wants you to focus on before we talk about let's just say what is a threat so a threat in cloud security is a potential negative action or event facilitated by the vulnerability that results in an unwanted impact to a computer system or application and so as you're watching you know the following four types so the first is a dictionary tax so attackers attempt to steal identity by brute forcing into a target account by enumerating over a large number of known passwords and i actually put the word numerating in there because it's very common to see this when you are doing uh pen testing enumeration is very common uh but throughout the entire course i never saw them ever use that term so i figured hey i'll insert it there so you get to see it disruptive attack so an attack which attempts to disrupt a computer system or computer network for various reasons so that could be ddos coin miners root kits trojans worms ransomware a type of malicious software that when installed holds data workstations are a network hostage until a ransom has been paid we've heard of entire like cities being ransomed you know what i mean like the mayor has to pay some person somewhere to to get something back you know data breach so when a malicious actor gains unauthorized access to a system in order to extract private data so those are the core four threats they want you to know okay hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at the concept of vulnerabilities so a vulnerability is a whole or weakness in the application that can beat a design flaw or implementation bug that allows an attacker to cause harm to stakeholders or an application the term is used throughout the sc900 course but they never describe it so here i'm describing it for you and i've actually pulled up a bunch of vulnerabilities from owasp owps is the open web application security project if you're in security you want to know what oh wasp is they have a lot of cool things there but i just got their big old list here so here's a big list and this is application focused uh but there's some that you might have seen before like buffer overflow ever heard of stack overflow that's kind of what they're talking about there take advantage of memory leaks least privilege violation so this is a very very common one where um uh the privileges aren't strict enough and that's where they can escalate their privileges uh or maybe we have like using a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm maybe like instead of using uh shaw you should be using bcryp things like that uh you know but i just want you to fundamentally understand what a vulnerability is it's a whole or weakness in an application okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at encryption and to understand this we need to know what cryptography is so this is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties which we'll call adversaries and so encryption is the process of encoding so scrambling information using a key and cipher to store sensitive data in an unintelligible format as a means of protection an encryption takes in plain text and produces a cipher text um and so a very famous example of an encryption machine was the enigma machine used during world war ii uh and the idea was that you'd have to get a daily key and this would set the position of the rotors and these rotors would determine what ciphers would be substituted for that day all right hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and we were just looking at encryption and we saw the word cipher so i want to dive in and describe what that is so a cipher is an algorithm that performs encryption or decryption and cipher is synonymous with code so a lot of times ciphering code just means the same thing notice that this has an i and this has a y both are valid spellings i put both of them in here just so that you're comfortable with it if you're in canada or the uk uh we like to use the y if you're in the states or other places they like to use the i so both are okay when you use a cipher the output is a cipher text and so basically it takes plain text and just looks like scrambled text and so here's an example and this is way back in the day it kind of makes the illustration pretty clear but this was a a code book and it would store different cryptographic codes so if we were to zoom in here if you're given the code 0 2 or 0 4 it could mean uh this or i suppose like the word canoe could also mean has the authority so there's a bit of an encoding there uh or sorry like a cipher there to understand that translation so hopefully that makes it clear so to complete the puzzle for encryption you have a cipher and a key so a cryptographic key is a variable used in conjunction with an encryption algorithm in order to encrypt or decrypt data and so we have two uh types of keys we have symmetric keys and this is when you use the same key for encoding decoding so here is my key right i have my plain text i use that key it turns it into cipher text notice the text is not human readable and then i use the same key to turn it back into plain text and the most common uh symmetric encryption is aes and you'll definitely see that when working with azure aws or any cloud service provider then you have symmetric encryption or say asymmetric encryption this is when you use two keys one key to encode and one key to decode and so very similar process but the keys are separated uh the most popular case here is rsa okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at the concepts of hashing and salting so hashing is a function that accepts an arbitrary size of values and maps it to a fixed size data structure and hashing can reduce the size of the stored value now that is a benefit of hashing but that's not necessarily why we're using hashing so hashing is a oneway process meaning once you turn that text into a hash it's basically unreadable at that point and it's deterministic meaning that um it's a it it's a process where the input will always produce the same output so if you always give it john smith it's always going to produce o2 all right now the hash can be whatever it doesn't necessarily mean john smith will be o2 it's just based on what the hashing function uh uh operates like how it works okay so the use case for hashing is for hashing passwords if you have a database you do not want them to reside in plain text because if a malicious actor gets in they can just see all the passwords so by hashing it it obscures what the password is now the way you would authenticate against the password because if a user inputs a password you have to match it against it you just have to hash the the inputted password and then match it against um the hash password right the hashed values and so popular hashing functions are md5 shot three 356 b b crypt is pretty popular that's what everyone uses because it's very long and good uh if an attacker knows what what function you are using so if it knows uh the hashing function then that's an issue because you know they might not be able to see the password but they can enumerate against uh enumerate means like iterate through a bunch of passwords they have to determine what the password is so a preventative measure so they can't enumerate uh using a dictionary a password dictionary is to salt the password so a salt is a random string not known to the attacker that the hash function accepts to mitigate the deterministic nature of hashing functions okay so that is hashing insulting hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at digital signatures and signings so what is a digital signature it's a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents and a digital signature gives us temper tamper evidence so imagine you had objects on your desk if you took something like baby powder which is a fine grain dust and spread it over your desk if someone were to move your items you would see clearly see that they have been moved because there'd be an outline between the powder and the area that had no powder underneath the objects and that's an example a real world example of tamper evidence so it's going to answer did someone mess or modify the data is this data not from the expected sender that's what these tamper evidence are telling us so there are three algorithms to digital signatures and so there is a visual example that i got from wikipedia i couldn't be bothered to make an image today but the idea is you have key generation so generates a public and private key so there are our two keys public and private and so we have the signing so this is the process of generating a digital signature with a private key and the inputted message so we have our private key and we have our inputted message and then you can see that it's attached to our message here you have signing verification so verify the authenticity of a message with a public key so when it's received by the other person we use the public key to determine that it is from the person we think that it's from and it hasn't been tampered with so a very famous example of this would be ssh so this is used for logging into remote virtual machines and we use a public and private key to authorize remote access to that machine uh and what you do is you'd probably use the ssh keygen command this is a very wellknown command and i haven't memorized because i i've used it so many times and so will you and notice that it has a hyphen t so it says that we want to take rsa as the input that is the type of algorithm that we are using um to generate out uh that okay and remember earlier on when we were talking about asymmetric keys where there was two keys and we mentioned rsa that's the same key here okay one other thing i want to mention is code signing just because when you hear signing you might see code signing what the difference is this is just when you use a digital signature to ensure computer code has not been tampered with all right so if you have a repository uh you know people might try to inject bad code into your repo and this is one way to prevent it okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are comparing in transit versus at rest encryption so encryption and transit is data that is secure when moving between locations and our algorithms that we'll see here is tls and ssl for encryption at rest this is data that's secure when residing on storage or within a database and so algorithms here could be used would be aes or ras all right we've covered aes and res but let's talk about tls and ssl so tls which stands for transport layer security is an encryption protocol for data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications tls is deprecated in favor of ssl that means that we don't use it anymore but every time you know we mention encryption transit or ssl everyone always mentions tls where ssl originates from so even though we don't use it you just see everyone always mentioning it so ssl stands for secure socket layers and it's an encryption protocol for data integrity between two or more communicating computer applications how it's different from tls i can't remember myself but i just want you to know that ssl is the one that is used today so when you connect to a website you see https that is using ssl hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at multifactor authentication also known as mfa and that's how i'll refer to it through the entire course and it's a security control where after you fill in your email and password you have to use a second device such as a phone to confirm that it's you that is logging in so mfa protects against people who have stolen your password mfa is an option in most cloud providers and even social media websites such as facebook so here it is example you see my email my password and that is called one factor so i've confirmed my identity like uh in this one case and then you have the second factor also known as multifactor that's usually what we call it and then that's going to let us get into the system okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at security information event management siem so to understand this we're just going to define a couple things so what is log management well this focuses on simple collection and storage of log messages and audit trails then you have event logs so system and applications generate events which are kept in event logs list of activities that occurred with records of new events being appended to the end of the logs as they occur so when we say what is a security information management sim this is the longterm storage as well as analysis and reporting of log data then you have an sem so this is for security event management so realtime monitoring correlation events and notifications of consoles notice here logs logs events events okay so there's a correlation between these two definitions for you so what is security information event management well it's simply the combination of a sim and a sem to provide realtime analysis of security alerts generated by the network hardware and applications so here we have our siem and we would have features like log collection log analysis uh event correlation log forensic it compliance application log monitoring object access auditing realtime alerting user activity monitoring dashboards reporting file integrity monitoring system and device monitoring or log monitoring and log retention so you can see that this tool does a lot and it's very important in your security tool belt hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at security orchestration and automated response also known as soar and this collects data about security threats and responds to security events without human assistance so the source system will trigger action driven automated workflows these are called playbooks and processes uh the process to run security tasks that mitigate the issue so for security orchestration there's two components here security orchestration and automated response so for security orchestration it connects various internal or external security tools via builtin or custom integration so possible connectors and this is not an exhaustive list but vulnerability scanners endpoint protection and user behavior analytics firewalls intrusion detection protection systems security information and event management so ciem threat intelligence feeds so for the security automation side it analyzes the injected data to create playbooks so these are repeatable automated processes to replace manual processes it'll be replacing things like vulnerability scanning log analysis ticket checking auditing and a sort can use ai and ml to provide recommendations and further automate responses hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at extended detection response of xdr and so this is a crosslayer detection and response security system and xdr uses a holistic approach detect and respond to threats that would normally evade detection in a single vector solution by collaborating multiple data sources into a multivector solution so here is our xcr and what we need is a data lake to store these various data so we get network data fire email endpoints cloud workloads and the xtr is going to allow us to do things like automated detection sweeping hunting root cause analysis and we can use that with our siem or soar so this can be used to uh to augment uh these other solutions here okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at endpoint detection in response to edr and this combines realtime continuous monitoring and collection of endpoint data with rules based on automated response and analysis capabilities i'm sure explained somewhere else in the course but an end point is an entry uh is an entry or gate on your security perimeter it's a way to enter the network okay and so ed edps are designed to detect apt so what is an apt it stands for advanced persistent threat and the idea here is that these threats will breach a security perimeter so through an endpoint and take up residence within a network to steal as much data as it can over a long period of time apts are threat actors so they're not software they're actually people behind them that engineer specific malware uh engineered for a particular target apts are slow acting and stealthy and common targets for apts are tier one manufacturers defense contractors government agencies so how an ed edr is going to help you is it's going to do detection so behavioral analysis advanced uh detection techniques ioc scans for response it has automated response on discovery quick response during the investigation multiple response options and for investigation it has it has root cause attack visualizations uh enriched attack data very similar it seems very similar to an xdr but the edrs are focused all around endpoints and xdrs are a lot more broader so um you know edr's just do a better job with endpoints okay but you can use both hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at cloud access security brokers also known as casb and this system sits between the cloud user and the cloud application and monitors all activity enforces security policies so on the left hand side you'd have your remote workforce maybe they're working from home maybe they're on the job like at a a remote location then you have your corporate office so this is where everyone would be in a very controlled environment but all that traffic is going to pass through the casb and the idea here is you'll get control of monitoring compliance management data security and threat protection for your cloud services whether it's software as a service platform as a service or infrastructure as a service so some of the features to help you think about what csb can do for you uh is it has monitoring user activity warning administrators about potential hazardous actions enforcing security policy compliance automatically preventing malware restricts unauthorized access identify account takeovers uncovers shadow cloud i.t or just shadow i.t is an easy way to say it cloud data loss prevention internal external data access controls records an audit trail of risky behavior cloud phishing malware threats and continuous monitoring of new cloud threats now i would say that if i had to highlight any of them out of here and i really should have put this in red here is i would say uncover shadow i t and if that doesn't make sense don't worry we explain it later hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are exploring the concept of security posture and in order to do that we're just going to have to set up some additional terms here this one is very term loaded so get ready for this the first one here is malicious actors also known as threat actors or attackers i like to call them malicious actors it is a person machine or entity of an event or incident that impacts or has the potential to impact the safety or security of another entity this is the bad person okay inventory so uptodate lists of uh assets software and hardware for your organization that can be accompanied with additional metadata there's a different kinds of assets in our inventory so we have perimeter assets assets exposed to the internet so public facing core assets assets within your private network private facing when we say attack vector this is the method of a malicious attack uses that they use to breach or infiltrate a network they could target infrastructure or a human for weakness and a lot of the cases we're seeing more human engineered attack vectors than going directly for infrastructure the attack surface is the sum of the attack factors the larger the inventory generally increases the amount of attack vectors the larger the attack surface the more difficult it is to mitigate attacks then you have security controls you'll hear this word security controls over and over again in this course controls are safeguards or counter measures to avoid detect counteract or minimize security risks and then we can answer what a security posture is so a formula to determine the overall effectiveness of a company's security overall defense we're talking about azure they call it a security score and it's basically a number and then you can go drill down and look at the security controls and the security controls can map out to your inventory so this is how you kind of see they're all tied together if we wanted to kind of describe how you would evaluate or assess the security posture uh here i got a little quick list here so we collect information by asking common questions so it could be what data do we collect how and where are we storing this data how do we protect uh we protect and document the data how long do we keep the data who has access to the internally external data is the place we are storing the data properly secured wipe that out there that's a bit of a mess um security ratings aka security scores so data driven objective and dynamic measurements of an organization security posture created by a trusted independent security rating platform so that is security posture and we'll definitely see it mentioned about like three times in this course okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at cloud security posture management also known as cspm and this identifies and remediates risks through security assessments and automated compliance and monitoring to give a kind of a visual for what this thing does so you have the cspm in the middle around it you got automation life cycle governance and brokerage and extending that a little bit further you got provisioning orchestration cost management resource optimization cloud migration backup disaster recovery identity security compliance uh packaging and delivery monitoring analytics inventory and classification and service requests so to reiterate you know a cspm assesses your system it automatically alerts security staff in your it departments when a vulnerability is found and so some security tools we can expect to see in here is zero trust based access controls realtime risk scoring threat and vulnerability management that is a very uh very useful cases of the tvms discover uh sharing risks technical policy threat modeling system and architecture teams that would use a ces pm would be your threat intelligence team your information technology your compliance and risk management teams your business leaders your smes uh your security architecture and operations and your audit team okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at just in time and just enough privileges these two terms come up a lot in microsoft and azure documentation but they don't fully explain them to you so i'm taking the time up front here so that you know it when you see the initialism so just in time also known as jit is giving access to resources only during the time when needed reducing the surface attack uh based on the range of time access so someone only needs something for two minutes uh give it to them and take it away right so and and give them access to things near the time that they need it so if they're not gonna use it from an hour from now don't give them give it to them so there's an hour window give it to them exactly when they're using it and when they're and take it away when they exactly aren't using it then you have just enough privilege so known as jep so giving access to only the specific actions reducing the surface attack by providing the least privileged principles this is pretty much uh the principle of least privilege which is another initialism i'm sure we'll see in the course but for some reason they call it this here but these are the two things you'll see throughout microsoft and azure documentation hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at ingress egress so very outdated but very clear graphic of how these two things work so ingress is traffic that's entering a network boundary and anger or egress is traffic exiting a network boundary and you're if you're wondering where these terms came from they're latin so ingressus and i don't i don't speak latin so i'm not pronouncing it properly and there's some variations on how to pronounce latin so who knows but ingress would mean to advance walk walking or an entry whereas egress is the opposite is it's to leave okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at the concept of shadow i.t which is a business agility process where departments can purchase and provision their own i.t resources without the approval of the organization's centralized i.t department so the advantage of shadow i.t systems allows organization to innovate and quickly prototype future solutions but the disadvantage of shadow i.t systems increase risk with organizational requirements for security controls compatibility with compliance programs loss of data or unexpected data exposure documentation reliability so uh you know you get great agility but then you need additional security services which we talked about earlier to make sure that there's no abuse of these shadow it systems hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at automation investigation and remediation so investigation is when you're gathering evidence from a digital system to uncover malicious intent or reduction in a security posture remediation is the action of remedying a as something to prevent or revert a disaster the act of changing a resource back to the desired state or state that does not cause a problem so in the context of cloud security a cloud resource is being remediated to stay compliant with our expected security controls so prevention would be something like turning the virtual machine off if the port 22 was exposed reverting would be turning back on encryption if a disk encryption is disabled so to revert so to put it back in the previous state so for the systems here we have automated investigation this is a service that uses an inspection algorithm that triggers an alert which in turn creates an incident and then we have automated remediation a service which watches for types of incidents uh incidents and matches it with a remediation action so it could be something like shutting off a server and so air so it's just the combination of these two systems so automated investigation and automated remediation okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at threat analysis and this is the practice of mitigating possible threats via threat modeling and threat modeling is a structured process for identifying attackers and cataloging past possible threats and so there's a lot of different methodologies for this and some to point out would be stride which is developed by microsoft uh pasta or pasta yeah i think that's how you'd say it process of attack simulation and threat analysis it's a seven uh seven step riskcentric methodology you have trike which is an open source threat modeling process mal which stands for mel meta attack language a domain specific language used for threat modeling and attack simulations uh and so you know that's that but we'll look at more detail here at stride okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at the stride methodology and so stride is for threat modeling as we just mentioned a moment ago and it can categorize different threats into the following so the first is spoofing so illegally accessing and then using another user's authentication information tampering some malicious modification of data repudiation so illegal operation in a system that lacks ability to trace the prohibited operation information disclosure so exposure of information to individuals who are not exposed to have access to it denial of service deny service to valid users and elevation of privileges unprivileged uh users gain privileged access so if you notice that spells stride all right so if we wanted to use stride we have the microsoft security development life cycle and it provides a tool to assist with this process and i believe they call it the microsoft threat modeling tool and it makes threat modeling easier for all developers through a standard notation for visualizing system components data flows and security boundaries all right so i wanted to actually show off the microsoft threat modeling tool so you get an idea what it can do so i typed in microsoft threat modeling tool and on the left hand side here there's a bunch of releases i actually didn't choose the latest one which i probably should have but if you scroll on down you'll see this thing that says microsoft threat modeling tool and i've opened it up and it looks like this and so they have an example model if we open it up we can see what we have here so basically it's a stenciling tool of generic things and so i mean you don't have to use this you could use something like lucidcharts or something else to do threat modeling but it's nice that this is a free program and it literally was like four megabytes to install if we wanted to see kind of an example that is more particular to azure we have threat model templates here and so um you can see that there are stencils for these particular resources so i guess the idea is that you know we might not have those stencils those azure stencils and so this one i guess adds it to the service so if we expand here we can see some threat modeling for um azure and so you know you have your your boundaries for your corporate net and then if we scroll on over we have our azure trust boundary and then our resource group trust boundary and you can see kind of where information flows between different services so like azure events data factory things like that so you know hopefully that gives you a visual idea what um threat modeling is uh but there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at intrusion detection and protection and so we have two systems here rolled into one so the first is ids intrusion detection system it monitors a network or system for malicious activity or policy violations and the idea is that uh once it detects something it's going to create an incident and so that you can go through an itemized list to take action then you have an ips so intrusion protection system this restricts or reacts to the the detected malicious activity taking action doing something about it if you roll these two into one you get an ids ips and this is how they are often offered in the market you're really going to see these things separated out as separate offerings okay if you're figuring out okay well how does an ids actually detect incidences it has three ways of doing it the first is signaturebased detection this is a simple technique where it uses a signature and a signature is a set of rules that an ids and an ips uses detect typical intrusion activity it compares signatures against observed events to identify possible incidents then you have anomalybased detection this is a more advanced technique and so it compares definitions of what is considered normal activity with observed events in order to identify significant deviations then you have stateful protocol analysis this is a profile technique it compares to predetermined profiles or generally accepted definitions of benign protocol activity for each protocol state against observed events in order to identify deviations no matter which one you're using whatever your provider is you want to turn this stuff on immediately because an ips ids is only useful if you have a baseline a a look at what normal activity looks like within your network so you cannot turn this stuff on late in the game you got to turn it on on day one okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at the mitre attack framework so first of all what is mitre it is a notforprofit organization supporting various us government agencies in the aviation defense healthcare homeland security and cyber security fields and then we have the mitre attack framework and this is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on realworld observations look down below you can see there's a lot of stuff in here if you're thinking about this knowledge base you might say well what is the purpose of it but it's used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector government and cyber security product and service community it has a website it's easy to view you just go to attack.miter.org and i think it's really great because if you look around it gives you kind of an idea of things that you have to be thinking about okay okay so i wanted to get you some exposure to the attack.miter.org just because i know you saw a screenshot but always helps to take a quicker look here if we scroll on down below we have categories across the top that are interested so maybe you're interested in privileged escalation but you know we can drill down here and say okay well what in particular are we interested in so let's say we want to look at exploitation of privileged escalation they have a full description on here and procedure examples of things that you can do so there is a lot of stuff in here okay so uh you know if you're wondering uh what it is that you need to do oh it just keeps on going you really drill down here and and read a lot of stuff but this really really does help you get a a full idea of the type of attacks that can happen on your system so definitely if you have more time check it out hey this is angie brown from exam pro we're going to look at the six microsoft privacy principles so the first being control which is we will put you in control of your privacy with easeofuse tools and clear choices second being transparency we'll be transparent about the data collection and and we use so you can make informed decisions number three we will protect the data you entrust uh to us through strong security encryption number four strong legal protection so we will respect your local privacy laws and fight for legal protection for your privacy as a fundamental human right number five no content based targeting so we will not use your email chat files or personal uh content to target ads that you uh have a hard time believing that fifth one but hey they say they don't do it number six benefits to you so we will uh when we do collect data we will use it to benefit you and make sure your experiences to make your experiences better so it's kind of funny because like it seems like number six could contradict number five but you know if they saw it as a benefit to you but yeah that's the microsoft privacy principle hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're looking at microsoft privacy not to be confused with microsoft privacy principles and the reason why there's privacy again here it's just because microsoft is a big organization and sometimes they have marketing efforts that overlap or conflict and it gets kind of confusing which is which and that's just microsoft being microsoft for you but we're going to go through it anyway because regardless of which one is more important i think it's just good to get good coverage here and it's explained in a slightly different way so helps you understand how these providers think uh you know about your data so starting at the top here we have control your data so you your data belongs to you you can access modify or delete it at any time you're in control of your data it's reinforced by microsoft compliance so gdpr iso 2718 they have independent audit reports data processing only with consent neither shared or mined for market research and advertising subcon subcontractors data restrictions so aka sub processors can perform only the function that microsoft has hired them to provide and they are bound by the same contractual privacy commitments that microsoft makes to you for controlled data location you choose where your data is located so choice of data center data residency residency meaning like the boundaries of a country or a geographic boundary we're talking about securing your data so data at rest they use a aes 256 encryption dating transit ssl and tls encryption keys you have azure key vault for defending your data responding to data requests they will not disclose data to a government or a law enforcement agency unless required by law law enforcement requests so direct the requesting party to seek the data directly from the customer so they're not doing it uh on your behalf okay uh our they have contact contractual commitments so using the courts to challenge governments demands that are inconsistent with the rule of law so they're always fighting on your side they have gdr compliance so disclose their data in response to a government request in violation of uh eu's gdpr disclose their data in response so gdpr compliance that could have been worded better i'm taking it from their content by the way but gdpr is is like if you're a european citizen you can say hey i don't want you to hold on to my data so show me what you have about me and also can you uh delete it okay and that's what that is there hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at primary security perimeter this is a super important concept and has a lot to do with identity and azure id so pay close attention here so what is security perimeter so barriers are built fortifications to either keep intruders out or to keep captives contained within the area the boundary surrounds so when we're talking about a data center we're talking about the physical fence as the security perimeter that's just one mechanism of security perimeter for cloud network we're talking about protocol software hardware as the security perimeter so what is an entry point this is the point of entry to cross a security perimeter and then we have access controls and these are the security mechanisms at the point of access that allow or denies access when we're talking about permission to access a resource this is called authorization and so what is a primary security perimeter so traditional security focused on firewalls vpn since there were fewer employees or workstations outside the office but now that we have bring your own devices remote workstations it is much more common now to access controls via a zero trust model i really should have highlighted that in yellow or red like that support very important and uh zero trust models are being adopted so we see mfa and we see a shift towards user identity management becoming the primary security primary perimeter for security so the primary security perimeter is user identity management and so when we're talking about azure it's going to be azure active directory because this is the most common tool okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're taking a look here at ipd's so identity providers is a system entity that creates uh maintains and manages identity for information four principles and also provides authentication services to applications within a federation or distributed network a trusted provider or of uh your user identity that lets you use authentication to access other services is another way to put it so an ipd could be something like facebook amazon google twitter github linkedin if you've ever used some service that said log in with your facebook account or google account that's what an ipd is so federated identity is a method of linking a user's identity across multiple separate identity management systems so a federation is just a collection of identities uh we have a few different technologies that are involved with ipds so the first is open id this is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol so this allows you to log in with different social media platforms such as google or facebook open id is about providing who you are auth 2.0 or oauth 2.0 is an industry standard protocol for authorization of oauth doesn't share your password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between the consumer and service provider and so oauth is about granting access to functionality so you can use open id and oauth 2.0 together the last is saml security assertion mark markup language it's an open standard for exchanging authentication authorization between identity providers and service provider uh it's a use case for saml which is single signon with web browser whenever using azure id and you want to connect a web app you're going to be looking at using saml okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and this is our introduction into azu of active directory also known as azure ad and it's microsoft's cloudbased identity and access management service which helps your employees sign in and access resources it's going to help us both externally and with internal resources so on the external side we're looking at microsoft 365 the azure portal sas applications and for internal resources so those are apps that reside within your internal network uh access to workstations uh that may reside on premise uh and one of the best features of azure ad is single signon that's what a lot of companies want it for uh in terms of uh the types of azure active directory there are it's broken down to four editions with each uh subsequent tier having all the features of the previous tier and so we have the free tier where you get multifactor authentication single signon basic security usage reports user management you have office 365 apps so that will give you company branding sla to sync between onpremise and cloud and the last two which i want you to notice and take note of because we do mention a lot of the features in this course for these two tiers it's premium one and premium two als commonly abbreviated to p1 and p2 so you have hybrid architecture advanced group access conditional access and for premium two you have identity protection identity governance so again as we move up the tier each of the previous tier has all the features of the prior one so premium one has uh or so premium two has all the features of premium one in terms of uh the use case for azure id it's for uh authorizing and authenticating to multiple sources so whether it's onpremise your active directory to your web app uh to allow for identity like using identity providers or to connect to microsoft 365 or microsoft azure azure id takes care of all this stuff and so when we're looking at hybrid connections we're talking about azure ad connect when we're looking at integrating our applications that is through app registrations where we have uh the b2c service and we'll talk about that in greater detail then you have external identities so that's going to be for your ipds uh and then you can also uh easily integrate with cloud applications there's no particular service like sub service for that it's just azure id naturally does that okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are comparing active directory versus azure active directory because they're not the same thing so active directory has been around for quite a long time it's been around since windows 2000 and it was first introduced as active directory domain services to give organizations the ability to manage multiple onpremise infrastructure components and systems using a single identity per user and so azure ad takes this approach to the next level by providing organizations with an identity as a service so an ida solution for their apps across cloud and onpremise so both are still used today so there's active directory which is used for onpremise and there's azure ad which is the cloud version and so we see a lot of companies might want to migrate over to azure id or they might have a particular legacy licensing that makes it more cost effective or there might be certain security compliances where that's why they're not using azure id so both of these are still valid products just different use cases okay let's take a closer look here at azure ad for app registration so app registrations allow developers to integrate web applications to use azure id to authenticate users and request access to user resources such as email calendar and documents and this allows you to implement single signon into your web applications the way you access it is you just go to your azure id and there's a section under there called app registrations we're definitely going to cover a little bit more about app registrations when we talk about azure 80 b2c because that is the actual way of uh doing authentication and we'll cover more about app registration there but just a quick introduction here okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're taking a look here at azure id external identities and the idea here is that it allows people outside your organization to access your apps and resources while letting them sign in using whatever identity they prefer so whether it's your partners distributors suppliers vendors or other guest users you can bring your own identities so it supports logins like google and facebook there's so many more and i'll show you in a moment but the idea here is you can share your apps with external users develop apps intended for azure ad tenants develop white label apps for consumers and customers and there's two identity external identities so there's b2b and b2c so bw is when you're working with another organization and they probably have their own azure ad or their own identity service that they want to connect to your app or services and b2c is when you're dealing with customers they're not part of an identity service they're just individuals okay and so when we're talking about uh ipd support so identity providers it's a big old list here so you got adfs amazon apple azure id single tenant multitenant uh to b2c ebay facebook generic identity providers github id dot me google linkedin microsoft account qq salesforce salesforce sample protocol twitter wechat and weeboo and this is pretty darn thorough because when you look at amazon cognito which is aws is offering does not have linkedin does not have twitter does not have github i mean one of these might be able to be possible but it's very hard to implement on theirs and so this is where i feel that azure adb to c has a competitive advantage maybe not as great as uh okta uh which is a third party but i think that azure 80 b2c beats them on price for sure and meets most use cases if we're going to just do a quick comparison between the b2b and b2c offering just to really solidify the difference we break it down into scenario intended uh ipd support etc etc so let's just go through here and see what the difference is so looking at the scenario collaboration using microsoft applications this one is an i am for modern sas or custom developed applications for intended use cases uh collaborating with business partners for from external organizations and this is customers of your product for uh identity support you have work accounts school accounts any email address saml wsfed based identity providers gmail facebook and for a b2c you have local applications social identities users with corporate and gov identities et cetera b2c i believe it's more expensive between the two external user management managed in the same directory as employees and then for b2c managed separately from the organization employees and partner directories for sso uh azure the connected app is supported and for uh sso on b2c it's customer owned apps with azure adb 2c tenants is supported for policy and compliance managed by the host inviting organization and for b2c it's managed by the organizations via conditional access identity protection for branding the host inviting organization brand is used and for b2c it's fully customized branding per application or organization for billing models they're both based on monthly active users so m a use and there you go let's take a look here at service principles for azure id and this is a security identity used by applications or services to access specific azure resources so a service principle is created when a user from the tenant has consented to the applications or api use and so what you do is you go over to app registrations uh to be able to set up a service principle so this defines who can access the application and what resources the application can access so down below you can see we have a few different options here so whether it's the organizational directory from the current company or a different one or whether you're allowed to use a personal account so a service principle is created in each tenant where the application is used and references the global unique application object so after you've registered your application you're going to have an object id and an application id that's what i was talking about earlier when i said about application registration we come back to it well this is the part where we're seeing how that works so the application id represents the global applications across all tenants and the object id is a unique value for an application object so there you go so manage identities within azure id are used to manage the credentials for authenticating a cloud application with an azure service so using a managed identity you can authenticate to any service that supports azure id authentication without having credentials in your code that is why we want managed identities remember that there are two types of managed identities system assigns so an identity in an azure id tied to a life cycle for a service instance when the resource is deleted so is the system assigned to the manage identity for user assigned it's an identity assigned to one or more instance of services the identity is managed separately from the resource when a resource is deleted the identity remains i want to drill this in so let's do a quick table here between systems and user assigns so for creation created as part of the azure resource for user assign created as a standalone azure resource for life cycle shared life cycle with the azure resource for user assigned the independent it has an independent life cycle for deletion when you delete the resource so does the identity go with it for user assign it must be explicitly deleted for sharing across azure resources cannot be shared associated with a single azure resource for users assigned can be shared can be associated with more than one azure resource okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at device management for azure id so let's just define what device identity management is it is the management of physical devices such as phones tablets laptops desktops computers that are granted access to company resources such as printers and cloud resources via devicebased conditional access so here's what it would look like if you opened up device manager and you had connected some devices notice on the lefthand side we got ourselves um a whoops i use the highlight tool i want the pen tool but we have some desktops and laptops we could have phones in here as well and there are different types of join types which we'll talk about here in a moment and you can apply mdm and we'll talk about mdm and mam in the upcoming slides but for companies with a distributed workforce that allows remote employees and who are allowed to use their own personal equipment this is what we call bring your own device so you should know byod a company needs a way to protect their organization's assets such as access to cloud resources across the devices where they have less control over the physical securities of the work environment so device management this stuff really ties back to the zero truss model that we talked about all the way at the start of this course um and this really illustrates how the identity is really your your uh the first security perimeter okay for uh getting devices into device management there are three different ways we have azure id registered so this is where you have personally owned or mobile devices you're signed in with a personal microsoft or local account and you'd be using things like windows 10 ios android mac os for azure ad joined it's owned by an organization signed in with an azure id account belong to the organization they exist only in the cloud and you look at windows 10 windows server 2019 for hybrid azure ad joined it's owned by an organization uh you are signed in with azure director active directory not azure sorry active directory domain services accounts belonging to the organization and they exist in the cloud or onpremise you're looking at windows 7 8.110 windows server 2008 or newer they're not going to ask you about all these details in the exam but you should know broadly these three categories and that uh you know the hybrids for hybrid azure id join is for um uh is cloud only for organizations and this one top one here is for personal okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at mdm and mam so mobile device management allows you to control the entire device wipe data from it and also reset it to factory settings where mobile application management allows you to publish push configure secure monitor and update mobile apps for your users and both of these features are found under your azure ad so there you would add an application such as microsoft intune and that's what you'd be using to get mdm and mam features uh microsoft intune uh has to be to get access to it you have to upgrade to azure ad premium two and microsoft intune is now part of microsoft endpoint manager used to be a standalone service but now it's part of this and microsoft endpoint manager and intune are part of the microsoft enterprise mobility security uh ems it's just like a suite of services that work together so i know it's a bit confusing but in tune is is part of endpoint manager which is part of ems okay so windows hello gives windows 10 users an alternative way to log into their devices and application using fingerprint iris scan facial recognition so these are biometrics an authentication type with windows hello would include microsoft account active directory account azure ad identity provider services or something like 502 which is a security key so i think ubiki windows hello pin is backed by a trusted platform module tpm chip it has multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper resistant the windows hello pin is more secure than a standard pin because it is tied to a specific device so the pin is for that device and only for that device okay there's two offerings here we have windows hello windows hello for business there's a lot more details here but i'm just going to give you the the the main difference so windows hello is for individual consumers and windows solo for business is for business uh windows hello uses a pin backed by hashing where windows hello uses a pin backed by an asymmetric public and private key or certificatebased authentication if you're a member or primer you know that a public and private key is just a lot more secure with windows hello for business you can also use group policies so gpo and mdm okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're taking a look here at azure 80 connect which is a hybrid service to connect your onpremise active directory to your azure account azure 80 connect allows for seamless single signon from your onpremise workstation to microsoft azure and it allows you to connect in the in the following ways so we have password hash synchronization which is a sign in method that synchronizes the hash of users on premise 80 password azure id password through authentication this is a signin method that allows users to use the same password on premise and in the cloud federation integration this is a hybrid environment using onpremise adfs infrastructure for certificate renewal these three are the authentication types okay so you want to remember those three some additional features we should cover the synchronization so responsible for creating users groups other objects ensures onprem and cloud data matches and health monitoring robust monitoring and provides a central location in the azure portal to view activity this last one is called azure 80 connect health okay let's take a look here at selfservice password reset also known as sspr this allows users to change or reset their password without the help of an administrator free up your help desk support requests add an additional layer of security and keep users more productive so selfservice password scenarios include password change so when a user knows their password but wants to change it to something new password reset when a user can't sign in such as when they forget the password and want to reset account unlock when a user can't sign in because their account is locked out so authentication methods for ssrp would be like mobile app notifications mobile app codes email mobile phones office phones and security questions okay let's take a look at a feature called azure ad password protection and to understand this we need to know the concept of password spraying and this is a type of brute force dictionary attack uh and uh the idea here is that identity systems mitigate traditional brute force attacks by having lockout and after a lockout would be after a certain amount of attempts the user is locked out and has to wait a short period of time before they can try their password again you've seen this like five attempts and then you're locked out for like 30 minutes so password spraying circumvents lockout by spraying the same password across multiple accounts before trying another password while the lockout time cools down or resets and so azure id password protection is a feature of azure id to protect your passwords from identity tax such as password spray attacks okay the uh the mechanisms here is we have global uh global band password list so this is a password list with known weak passwords that is automatically updated and enforced by microsoft you don't have to do anything you just get that uh as you use the service then you have a custom banned password list this is where you're going to provide a custom list of passwords that are more specific to your business security needs to get banned passwords lists you need azure ad one or two for hybrid security azure id password protection can be integrated to onpremise active directory environments okay so here's just a quick list of azure identity management best practices it's nothing super fun here just a very simple list but it's good for us to go through it so we have where we keep these things in mind so azure identity management access control security best practices starting with treat identity as the primary security perimeter this all comes back to zero trust policies right a centralized identity management manage connected tenants enable single signon turn on conditional access plan for routine security improvements enable password management enable multifactor verification for users use rolebased access controls lower exposure of privileged accounts control locations when resources are located are located and use azure ad for storage authentication so there you go let's talk about the concept of emergency access or break glass so emergency access accounts prevent admins from being accidentally locked out of their azure ad account okay so you might have seen these kind of devices before think of like if there's a fire and there's ax behind it you break the glass so there's a key these are just in the case of emergencies that you can get access so you can mitigate the impact of accidental accidental lack of administrative access by creating two or more emergency access accounts in your organization so emergency access accounts are highly privileged and they are not assigned to a specific individuals they are limited to emergency or break glass scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used recommended to maintain a maintained goal of restricting emergency accounts used to only the times when it's absolutely necessary so these accounts should be cloud only accounts that use the onmicrosoft.com domain not federated or synchronized from an onpremise environment exclude at least one account from a phonebased multifactor authentication exclude one account from a conditional access policies store these account credentials safely and monitor sign in and audit logs all right so azure active directory using mfa allows multiple authentication methods some of them is sms so that's where you have a text message and that's how you get your pin a voice call that has a synthesized voice that speaks your pin we have the microsoft authenticator app where you can use the app and press a button so you can do passwordless login and you have hardware tokens so this is where you touch your security key and authorize it by generating it and it will automatically generate and enter a pin for you so we'll just kind of dive a little bit deeper into these methods okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a quick look here at microsoft authenticator so this is a web application or sorry a mobile application you can download for either your ios or android phone it allows for secure signins for all your online accounts using multifactor authentication passwordless authentication password autofill and it's both available in the apple app store and google play store okay okay so i made my way over to the google play store because i just want to give you a a closer look at this service it's not complicated but if you click into here you can kind of see uh what it allows you to do so here we have a new signin request for your microsoft account so you would just say approve or deny so this is an example of password list right you don't have to put in a password to do the mfa um you can see when there are new signins on your phone it will autofill passwords in so here it's doing for linkedin you can see you can manage uh multiple accounts and it has those um you know those the general mfa codes there it can connect to multiple services so you have your outlook your onedrive and office 65 in general or microsoft 365 so you know nothing too complicated but you should give it an install and go because it's pretty good hey this is andrew brown from exam pro we're taking a look here at the concept of biometrics so biometrics are body measurements and calculations related to the human characteristics and biometric authentication or realistic authentication is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control so we have different kinds of characteristics there's physiological which we'll go through quickly here so like a fingerprint pawn veins face recognition dna palm print uh hand geometry iris recognition retina or odor or scent that last one sounds very interesting i've never heard of a system that can do that but it's on the list here behavioral characteristics so this would be like typing rhythm gait keystrokes signature behavioral profiling and voice so there you go so fido is a fast identity online alliance it's an open industry association whose mission is to develop and promote authentication standards that help reduce the world's over reliance on passwords so fido alliance has published three sets of open specifications for simpler stronger user authentication the first being universal second factor so u2f universal authentication framework so uaf client to authentication protocol so ctap and ctap is complementary to the w3c web authentication so web auth n and together those are known as fido 2. so the reason we're talking about fido 2 is this always comes down to security keys so a security key is a secondary device used as a second step in authentication process to gain access to a device workstation or application a security key can resemble a memory stick when your finger makes contact with a button or exposed metal on the device it will generate an auto filler security token a popular brand of security keys is the ub key it works out of the box with gmail facebook and hundreds more supports 502 auth and u2f and you just noticed we talked about all those things this particular device is waterproof and crest resistant works with usba nfc dual connectors on a single key it's going to vary based on the key you get they all have different features but this is a good baseline to understand security keys let's take a look here at open authentication also known as oath and i want you to know this is not to be confused with oauth very similar in names but not the same thing so oath is an open standard that specifies how timebased onetime passwords so totps codes are generated so timebased onetime passwords is a computer algorithm that generates a onetime password to otp which uses the current time as a source of uniqueness so uh oath totp is implemented using either software or hardware to generate code so for a software oath would be generated for something from like authenticator and hardware oath would be generated from a security key so this is an example actually in microsoft authenticator so just taking up my pen tool here this is the code you've you've seen these before so it's like three nine three eight one three there's a little wheel it spins and then it will reset the time here's more of a physical device i imagine that this is kind of the precursor to uh ubiki's or mobile apps the idea is that you'd have a physical device and it would count down it would change the times here okay so that's pretty much it password list authentication is a less frustrating authentication method than mfa and password list authentication methods are more convenient because the password is removed and replaced with something you have plus something you are or something you know so something you have could be windows 10 device phone security key something you are could be a biometric a biometric such as a fingerprint something you know could be a pin so or a password right so solutions for i guess not a password just be a pin but solutions for a password list authentication include windows hello for business the microsoft authenticator app 502 security key so just looking here we have kind of a four corners here inconvenient high security convenient low security so we put passwords on here generally they're very convenient everyone's used to using passwords however they don't have the highest amount of security from these other options sure you can make a very strong password but these other options are just passwordless authentication is a lot more powerful when you're using ufa or twofactor authentication multifactor authentication it's highly secure but the issue with this is that it can be kind of a pain to pull out your phone to get that otp that onetime password in order to complete that second step so password authentic passwordless authentication is both highly secure and convenient okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at azure ad conditional access which provides an extra layer of security before allowing authenticated users to access data or other assets so conditional access is implemented through conditional access policies and conditional access policy analyzes signals so signal could be user location device application realtime risk we'll talk about that in the next slide all the types of signals there are and the idea is you need to verify every access attempt via access control so you might have require mfa block or allow so just a visual here i got this graphic from the microsoft documentation the idea is you have your signal so user location application realtime risk devices and here we have our verification steps right to get access to our apps and data so let's take a quick or a a closer look at signals so signals is metadata associated with an identity attempting to gain access and so some examples or actually i guess the full list of signals that are possible conditional access starting with users or group memberships so policies target specific users and groups including admin roles giving admins fine grain control over access then you can have signals that are named location or ip location information so that's a range of ips used when making policy decisions so admins can opt to block or allow traffic from an entire country ip range as an example for devices users with devices of specific platforms are marked with a specific state can be used for applications users attempting to access specific applications can trigger different conditional access policies realtime realtime signin risk detection so signals integration with azure ad identity protection allows conditional access policies to identify risk signin behavior and policies can then force users to perform password changes mfa authentication to reduce the risk level or block or they're blocked from access until administrator takes manual action then you're do you have your cloud apps or cloud actions so cloud apps or actions can include or exclude cloud applications or user actions that will be subject to policy then there's user risk so from customers with access to identity protection user risk can be evaluated as part of conditional access policy user user risk represents the probability that a given identity or account is compromised user risk can be configured for high medium or low probability let's talk about common decisions so these define the access control that define what level of access based on the signal information and so this is when we were talking about you said that verifying steps these are those common decisions so we have block access so most restrictive decision then you have grant access and so this is the least restrictive decision but still requires one or more of the following options so require mfa require device to be marked as compliant require hybrid azure 80 join device require approved client app require app uh protection policy okay so there you go let's take a look here at azure 80 roles and these are used to manage azure ad resources in a directory such as create or edit users assign administrative roles to others reset user passwords manage user licenses manage domains so if you're an azure id you'd see roles and administrators on the righthand side and they have a bunch of prebuilt roles of course you can make your custom ones but a few ones that you should absolutely know is the global administrator this gives you full access to everything the user administrator this gives you full access to create and manage users the billing administrator which makes purchases manage descriptions to support tickets and you can create custom custom roles but you're going to need azure p1 or p2 okay let's take a look here at azure role based access controls or rbac so the idea here is that you have a security principle that represents identities requesting access to azure resources so that could be a user who has an individual profile in azure id a group of users uh created an azure id a service principle and this is a security identity used by applications or services to access specific azure resources or manage identity an identity in azure id that is automatically managed by azure so another thing that we that matters when we're talking about rolebased action controls is we have to determine the scope and so the scope is a set of resources that access for the role assignment applies to so scope access controls of the management subscription or group level right so you can apply it at this level a description level or the resource group level um just so you know okay the role definition is a collection of permissions a role definition lists the operations that can be performed such as read write and delete roles can be high level like owner specific like virtual machine reader and azure has builtin roles and you can define your own custom roles so the ones they have built in is owner contributor reader user admin access and these are the four fundamental builtin builtin roles that azure has so identity governance for azure id allows you to balance your organizational security versus employee productivity and that ensures the right people have the right access to the right resources so azure id and enterprise mobility plus security features allow you to mitigate asset access risks by protecting monitoring and auditing access to critical assets so identity governance gives organization the ability to do the following govern the identity life cycle govern the access life cycle secure privileges access for administration identity governance addresses these four questions so which users should have access to which resources what are those users doing with that access are there effective organizational controls for managing the access can auditors verify the controls uh that the the controls are working all right so human capital management also known as hcm is the practice of managing people as resources within an organization so an hcm system is an application that provides administrative and strategic support around human resources so for admins that's payroll benefits employee selfservice portals for strategic we're talking about workflows workforce planning competency management performance management time and expense management education training recruitment onboarding organizational visualizations and so some hcm systems out there would be um success factors from us from sas the sas hcm for some reason they they had original service and then i guess they have a newer version of the service uh workday oracle ebusiness suite oracle peoplesoft same thing we're seeing with uh sap where they have two sage people and i don't know how to pronounce it we'll say uzio so giving a little bit more attention to the different types of life cycles and identity governance we're first going to look at um identify identity life cycle management and this is the foundation of identity governance the goal is to achieve a balance between productivity and security so here we can kind of see an identity where they have no access they get their first job their second job and then they retire so productivity how quickly can a person have access to resources they need such as when they join my organization security how should their access change over time such as due to changes to the person's employment status so azure ad premium automatically maintains user identities for people represented in something like workday or sap success factors in both active directory and azure active directory azure id azure ad premium also includes microsoft identity manager so you can import records from onpremise hcm systems such as sap hcm oracle ebusiness or oracle peoplesoft azure adb2b collaboration enables you to securely share your organization's applications and services with guest users and external partners from an organization while maintaining control over your corporate data so azure ad entitlement management enables you to select which organizations users are allowed to request access and to be added to b2b guests to your organization directory ensure these guests are removed when they're no longer they no longer need access okay now we looked at identity lifecycle now let's take a look here at access lifecycle so access lifecycle is the process of managing user access throughout the life cycle of an organization so here uh you know before we saw that someone changed jobs well this one has uh context because they're accessing something like they have a contract so there's a particular set of things that they have to worry about so azure ad dynamic groups determine group membership based on user or device properties azure 80 access reviews enforce review or on a regular basis to make sure only the right people have continued access azure ad entitlement management enables you to define how users request access across packages of groups and team memberships application roles sharepoint online roles okay so we have one more life cycle here and this one is privileged access life cycle and it is the management of fine grade permissions over the life cycle of a user within an organization so here they might they might start as an admin then they get their first role their second roll and then they leave it so again these are they're also very similar but they're just a different scopes so azure ad privilege identity management so pim provides additional controls to securing access rights for resources across azure ad azure and other microsoft online services and so that's pretty much the only one that really is related to privileged access lifecycle okay so entitlement management is a feature of azure ad and is for identity governance feature that enables organizations to manage identity and access lifecycle at scale by automating access request workflows access assignments reviews and expiration so entitlement management is a feature of azure ad premium two it takes a and just to kind of give it a more simplified uh understanding what the service does you take a bunch of resources bundle them into an access package then apply it to internal or external users that for a specific range of time get just in time access so you accomplish this by creating a project catalog and access package so what is a project inside of entitlement entitlement management well it's a logical container for your catalog and access packages you have a catalog so resources are assigned to the project and resources could be things like groups and teams applications sharepoint sites talking about access packages here an access package is a bundle of all the resources with the access a user needs to work on a project or perform their task access packages are used to govern access for your internal employees and also users outside your organization access packages also include one or more policies a policy defines the rules or guard rails for assignments to access packages for access packages you can manage group memberships cloud app access and access rights sharepoint online sites organizational and technical roles so privileged identity management or pim is an azure ad service enabling you to manage control and monitor access to important resources in your organization you can manage resources from azure id azure 365 intune and more key features here is just in time privilege access to azure id and resources assign timebound access to resources using start and end dates require approval to activate privileged roles enforce mfa to activate any role use justice justification to understand why users activate get notifications when privileged rules are activated conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles download audit history for internal external audits so privilege identity management is a feature of azure 80 premium two but to get kind of an idea like i just pulled out a little screenshot of the interface there and so you can see you have requests and approval requests and review access so those are some of the things you're going to be doing in there okay so identity protection is a feature of azure id at the p2 level that you can use to detect investigate remediate export for future analysis identity based risks so microsoft analyzes 6.5 trillion signals per day to identify protect customers from threats so identity protection notices things like risky users risky signins and risky detections so here's an example i know the image is blurry but it was hard for me to procure an image for you but this example shows newly risky signins detected over a period of time and so then there might be these cards here that will show you um you know who are the high risk users the high resignins the identity score things like that okay let's take a more granular look to see what identity protection can actually detect so it can look for anonymous ip addresses so sign ins from anonymous ip addresses like a tor browser anomalizer vpns atypical travel so sign in from a atypical location based on the user's recent sign ins malware to ip addresses so sign in from a malware linked ip address unfamiliar sign in properties to sign in with properties we've not recently seen for a given user leak credentials site indicates that the user's valid credentials have may have been leaked password spray so multiple user names being attacked using common passwords in a unified brute force manner azure ad threat intelligence so microsoft internal external threat intelligence sources that have identified a known attack pattern so maybe new countries so this detection is discovered by microsoft cloud app security activity from anonymous ip addresses so the detection is discovered by the microsoft cloud app security so mcas suspicious inbox forwarding so this detection is discovered by microsoft cloud app security so mcas and the wrist signals can trigger remediation efforts such as requiring users to use azure 80 multifactor authentication reset their password using selfservice password reset so that's ss pr or blocking or blocking them until an administrator takes action let's take a look here at investigation for identity protection so identity protection categorized risks into three tiers low medium and high so key reports that the admins use for investigation and identity protection are risky users risky signins and risky detection so for risky users those are details about detections history of all risky signins risk history and then for risky risky signins we have which risk signins are classified at risks confirmed compromise confirmed sale dismissed or remediated we have realtime and aggregate risk levels with sign in attempts detection types triggered conditional access policies applied mfa details device apps location information and the last one here is risk detection so that contains filterable data for up to the past 90 days so we have information about each risk detection including the type other risk triggers at the same time sign in attempt location link out to more detail for mcas so admin followup actions reset the user password confirm user compromise dismiss user risk block user from signing in investigate further using azure atp so network security groups filter network traffic to and from the azure resource in a vnet and so an nsg is composed of many security rules and so here's an example of setting an inbound security rule and each security rule has the following properties so you can give it a unique name which is all the way at the bottom there uh you can set the source or destination so you're gonna set an ip address cider block service tag application group things like that then you set the port range so it could just be port 80 it could be all ports where it shows an asterisk it could be a range of ports you can set the protocol so you got tcp udp icmp you set the action whether it's allowed or denied and then you set the priority which is a number between 100 and 4096 and we have two types of security rules we got inbound rules which applies to traffic entering the nsg and outbound rules that apply to traffic leaving the nsg let's take a look at some of the default security rules that nsg sets for you so when you create an nsg you're going to have some created for you by default and that's going to be for outbound rules and inbound rules so for inbound rules uh you're going to be able to accept any virtual networks into your through the nsg uh it's going to allow azure load balancer to make its way in and it's going to deny everything else all right then for your outbound rules it's allowed to go to any other virtual network it's allowed to make its way out to the internet and then everything else is denied so there you go let's take a look here at the logic for security rules and there's a lot of logic here so we'll work our way through it unfortunately there's no fun way to visualize this so we just got to work through the text so you may not create two security rules with the same priority and direction you can have 5000 nsgs per subscription and 1 000 nsg's rules per nsg for priority rules are processed in priority order with lowest number uh processed before the higher number and network security groups uh rules are validated by priority using a five tuple information to allow or deny traffic based on source source ports destination destination ports and protocol honestly i don't know what they mean by that uh and i couldn't make any sense it's in the documentation so i'm just showing it to you here then there's flow records they don't exactly explain what they are but i assume the idea is that uh when a request throws uh flows through the nsg they're attaching additional information to it uh so the flow record allows a network security group to be stateful a flow record is created for existing connections uh communication is allowed or denied based on the connection state of the flow record and so let's talk about statefulness so if you specify an outbound security port you don't need to set the inbound port since it will be set for you you will need to specify an inbound security rule if the communication is initially externally initiated externally and the opposite is also true if inbound traffic is allowed over a port it's not necessary to specify an outbound security rule to respond to traffic over the port uh and the reason i know this when up when another port is set with another one that's when it's stateful if it didn't do that it then would be considered stateless but it's stateful let's talk about interruption so existing connections may not be interrupted when you remove a security rule that enabled the flow and traffic flows are interrupted when connections are stopped and no traffic is flowing in either direction for at least a few minutes so there's the rules uh a lot of stuff there honestly i won't even remember 90 of this stuff but i just wanted to go uh through it with you so there you go so the thing is is that when you have network security groups you can apply them at the subnet and or the nic and that's going to change how the rules work so let's look at these combination of scenarios so here we have the internet and let's set ourselves up with a virtual machine that has a nick but it has no network security group so what's going to happen in this case well when there is no nsg assigned to the subnet or nic then all traffic is allowed uh not something i recommend i think you should always have an nsg there uh but that's what's going to happen our next scenario here is that we have a virtual machine and then we have a neck and the network or the network security group is attached to that neck so when an nsg is assigned to the nick and no energy at the subnet then the rules are predictable based on the allow or deny rule so whatever you set your nsg is what you expect it to be then we have a scenario here where we have two virtual machines with their own nics and one has a security group and the other two uh you know the they have to pass through the security group that supplied the subnet level so let's look at the one the left first so the energy applied to a subnet applies to the rules and all the resources in that subnet and so basically on the left hand side it's going to just act like the the other one there where all the rules you have there are are normal but the last one is the interesting use case because if the first so the first thing is the the first nsg rules are evaluated at the subnet and then the rules in the nick are evaluated so the thing is is that if you want port 80 to be open you actually have to open it on both otherwise it's going to get stuck uh on the first one so if your subnet has port 80 closed and then your your nic has port 80 open it just can't reach it so they both have to be open so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at the azure network security group cheat sheet so nsgs filter network traffic to and from azure resources vnet an nsg is composed of many security rules you have a name a source and destination a port range and a protocol and an action a priority okay you have inbound rules which apply to traffic entering the nsg and then you have outbound rules applying to traffic leaving the nsg by default azure will set a bunch of inbound and outbound rules for you you may uh you may not create two security rules within the same priority and direction you can have 5 000 nsgs per subscription and 1 000 nsgs per rules per nsg that's a lot you have to be pretty big company run out of those rules are processed in priority order with lower numbers processed before higher numbers the flow record allows a network security group to be stateful if you specify an outbound security port you don't need to set the inbound port since it will be set for you the opposite is true if inbound traffic is allowed over a port it's not necessary to specify an outbound security rule to respond to the traffic over the port what i could not fit in this cheat sheet was the scenario where you have multiple nsgs based on whether they're on the nick or the virtual machine or etc there is graphics for that in the in the slides make sure you review those before you set your exam okay azure firewall is a managed cloudbased network security service that protects azure vnet's resources and it's a fully stateful firewall as a service so you're going to get built in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability and what you can do is essentially create enforce and log application network connectivity policies across subscription and virtual networks so azure firewall uses a static public ip address for your vnet resources allowing outside firewalls to identify or originating from your virtual network and the service is fully integrated with azure monitor for logging and analytics so here is a representation of azure firewall and so the idea is that you're going to launch an azure firewall into its own vnet and then other vnets and your onpremise or other things are going to pass through that central vnet onto wherever they want to go and the idea is that we're going to be able to do things like i utilize microsoft threat intelligence this is going to block known malicious ips and fqdns that it stands for fully qualified domain names and by default the traffic is uh set to deny but you can set connectivity policies to filter out traffic in a variety of ways to make sure that you are protected uh there so yeah that's all there is to it hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at ddos so this stands for distributed denial of service attack and it's a malicious attempt to disrupt normal traffic by flooding a website with large amounts of fake traffic so the idea is you have an attacker and a victim and the attacker is utilizing a remote machines and uh with a with some software that's going to generate out traffic uh directed towards your virtual machine over the cloud and the uh problem here is that what it's going to do is it's going to make your website unresponsive or just not work at all for the regular user but by having your compute within the azure network you're going to get free ddos protection and that's going to mitigate these attacks so let's talk about the types of ddos attacks that frequently happen the first is volumetric attacks so these are volumebased attacks that flood the network with legitimate looking traffic these will exhaust the available bandwidth and legitimate users cannot access the website these are measured in bits per second so bps then there are protocol attacks and these are exhausting server resources with false protocol requests that exploit weakness you're looking at udp and tcp flooding on the layer three and four measured in packages per second so psp then you have application layer attacks these are attacks that occur at the application layer uh that's between layer seven so you're looking at http floods sql injection crosssite scripting also known as xss parameter tampering solaris attacks here you're going to be wanting using a waff a web application firewall as a means of protection laughs are generally paired a lot a lot together with ddos services across the cloud service provider offerings okay so azure offers two tiers of ddos protection the first is uh the the basic tier this is free it's already turned on uh it's part of the global network and then you have the standard that starts at about two thousand nine hundred and uh about three thousand usd you get metrics alerts reporting ddos expert support application cost protections sla there's probably a difference in terms of the tier protection i cannot remember off the top my head but you know one will protect more likely against certain types of tax at like like three and four and the other one will do all all the layers three four and seven okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at azure bastion which is an intermediate hardened instance you can use to connect to your target server via ssh or rdp an easy way to think of it it's just a machine that sits between you and your server to give you an additional layer of security so it will provision a webbased rdp client or ssh terminal and some devices just cannot run the rdb client so this is where a google chromebook uh is really great fit for azure bastion because this will be the only way you'd be able to do it is through azure bastion so when you want to make an a bastion you'll have to create its own subnet with a very particular name but some of the key features here of bastion is rdp and ssh directly into azure portal remote session over tls and firewall transversal no public ip required on the azure vm no hassle managing nsgs protection against port scanning protection uh protection against zero day exploits hardening in one place only uh so yeah now if you want to connect to a windows server you would have to use rdp and you have to have the bastion in the same vnet you just enter your username and password as you normally would if you did rdp so rdp is remote desktop protocol and the idea is that you just log in and now it's like you're using a windows machine then you have ssh which is for linux and so the idea here is you'd have your ssh private key and password that you'd set when you create your vm and when you want to hit connect you just provide either your password or the private key and now you're in your server so that's as simple as ask your bastion is hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're going to take a look here at azure web application firewall so uh azure web application firewall also known as waf is a service that protects web application communication on the application layer that's layer seven by analyzing incoming http requests uh waff for cloud providers are generally attached to load balancers api gateways or cdns so here's kind of a visual um that i got from the docs but the idea is you have your your request it's gonna go into your application load balancer the waf is attached to the load bouncer it's going to decide whether it's allowed to go through or not uh so it's kind of a bit of a gatekeeper there okay so azure waff can be attached to the azure application gateway azure front a front door which is a cdn azure con content delivery network which is a different kind of cdn uh and so the idea here is that azure waff uses core rule sets crs by owasp to protect against common vulnerabilities if you've never heard of owasp they stand for open web application security project and basically it's an organization a nonprofit organization and they have all these resources on how to protect against different types of threats and they have basically this top ten a list of vulnerabilities so that's probably what they're using here um but anyway so a waff policy allows you to apply manage rules so the azure manage owasp rules and custom rules so there you go all right let's take a look here at the overview for azure encryption so we have three options here for encryption methods the first is azure storage service encryption also known as ssc and this protects data at rest by automatically encrypting before persisting it to the azure managed disks azure blob storage azure files azure queue storage it also is used to decrypt data on retrieval then you have azure disk encryption this encrypts windows and linux iaas virtual machine disks it can use bitlocker features on windows or dmcrypt on linux then you have transparent transparent data encryption tde which we'll talk about here in a moment all right so there are two available encryption options for azure managed disks the first is server side encryption ssc and azure disk encryption ade so for server side encryption it provides encryption at rest and safeguards your data to meet your organizational security compliance commitments it's enabled by default for all the managed snapshots and images except for temporary disks which are not encrypted by serverside encryption unless you enable encryption at the host level so keys can be managed uh two ways you have platform managed keys azure managers or keys or customer managed keys so you manage your keys then you have azure disk encryption ade this allows you to encrypt the os and data disks used by uh infrastructure as service vms so for windows you're going to be using bitlocker and for linux encryption you're going to be using dmcrypt so there you go so transparent data encryption also known as tde encrypts data rest for microsoft databases tde can be applied to sql server azure sql database azure synapse analytics and tde does realtime io encryption and decryption of data and log files encryption uses a database encryption key also known as a dek database boot record stores the key for availability during recovery the dek is a symmetric key so same cryptographic key uh for both the encryption or plain text cipher just an example there so you understand so the steps to apply to the database create the database master key create a certificate to support the tde create the database encryption key enable tde on the database so you just turn it on and there you go let's take a look here at azure key vault which helps you safeguard cryptographic keys and other secrets used by cloud apps and services so you have secrets management so store and tightly control access to tokens password certificates api keys and other secrets key management create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data certificate management easily provision manage and deploy public and private ssl certificates for use with azure and internal connected resources and hsms so secrets and keys can be protected either by software or a hardware one which would be fips 140 hyphen 2 level 2 validated hsm so when we're talking about hsm this is a hardware security module it's a piece of hardware designed to store encryption keys so there's one and they're really darn expensive you wouldn't want to buy one out right it's a lot better if you just kind of borrow one from the cloud and this all goes along with the federal information processing standard fips this is a us and government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information so hmn's hsms or multitenant are 142 hyphen compliant so the multiple customers virtually isolated on an hsm if you want a single tenant this is this will give you a fips 140 hive and three compliance uh and this is for a single customer dedicated hsm i believe one is temp tamper evident and the other one is tamper proof um but uh yeah so for key vault the the single tenant is just a separate offering okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at azure security benchmarks so these includes a collection of high impact security recommendations you can use to help secure the services you use in azure include security controls and service based lines so azure security benchmark is a holistic security guidance influenced by the cloud adoption framework the azure well architected framework and the microsoft security best practices so we're talking about security controls these are recommendations that are generally applicable across your azure tenant and azure services each recommendation identifies a list of stakeholders that are typically involved in planning approval or implementation of the benchmark then you have service baselines so these apply the controls to individual azure services to provide recommendations on that service uh security configuration let's take a look here at azure security center and this is a unified infrastructure security management system it strengthens the security posture of your data centers provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud so here is what it looks like and the idea here is that you have a regulatory compliance dashboard that shows you your compliance posture for a set of supported standards regulations based on continuous assessment of your azure environment so the compliance policies currently supported are the azure security benchmark ppci dss iso 22701 sock tsp so here you would see um a compliance policy and you can see that it has 32 out of 40 past controls if you drill down you could see those controls in detail uh then there there's the security score so security center continually assesses your resources descriptions and organization for security issues it then aggregates all the findings into a single score so you can tell at a glance your uh your current situation so the higher the score the lower the identified risk level so there you go you can see this one is at uh holding at 80 percent uh the security score helps with understanding your current security situation efficiently and effectively improving your security the security controls within azure security center are used to calculate the overall score so security controls are recommendations of actionable security items that will help improve your overall security score so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look at azure security benchmarks if you feel like you're having deja vu it's because i covered this earlier in the course but i wanted to give it a little bit more attention here so i described it in an alternate way here and digged a little bit deeper all right so before we can answer what the security benchmark is let's describe what a security baseline is so a security baseline is a set of minimum security controls defined for defined for low impact information systems moderate impact information systems and high impact information systems so security baselines for azure focus on cloud sensor control area uh control areas and these controls are consistent with wellknown security benchmarks such as described by the center of internet security cis so azure security benchmark asb is a security baseline for azure and the benchmark is part of a set of holistic security guide guidance that also includes the azure cloud adoption framework azure well architected framework and the microsoft security best practices so the azure security benchmark has the following controls and these are grouped so you have network security identity management privilege access data protection asset management logging threat detection incident response posture vulnerability management endpoint security backup and recovery governance and strategy and this whole thing the azure security benchmark is actually just an excel spreadsheet that you can download uh and what it includes are recommendations with the following fields so azure controls ids recommendations guidance responsibility azure security monitor center whether the azure security center monitors this control which is kind of weird because when i actually opened it up these fields didn't exactly match one to one but i do i did pull out one in particular for us so we can see what it looks like so they'll have general guidance here so notice that they're just kind of like describing it so they're just saying what it can do and then we have some links and notice that it's linking to um i'm not sure which stock this is but when they talked about those three uh resources that's what they talk about when they're saying that they're influenced by those three for azure control this would be the asset management then it has its id uh then there are um uh cis controls so like these or nist controls so the idea is they're saying like yeah we have this control in our system but they map over to these wellknown ones so you know you can trust them uh then there's the benchmark recommendation uh then there's responsibility so here's this customer and then there's customer stakeholders um and that points over to the cloud adoption framework so uh you know you can open it up and give it a read it's not super fun but this pretty much is the gist of it okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are taking a look here at azure defenders so azure defender provides advanced protection for your azure and onpremise workloads and azure defender can be found in the azure security center so with the security center there'll be a tab called azure defender and that's the way you find it so azure defender is composed of coverage security alerts insights and advanced protection so talking about coverage it allows you to see the resource types that are in your subscription and eligible for protection by azure defender so here take note that we can see things like virtual machines kubernetes services container registry app services sql vms vault key vaults sql servers and storage accounts for security alerts they describe details of the affected resources such as remediation steps and in some cases an option to trigger a logic app in response so here you can kind of see security alerts over time uh then there are insights this is a rolling pane of news suggested reading and high priority alerts that give security centers insights into pressing security matters that are relevant to you and your subscription for advanced protection within defender are additional security features that is driven by analytics so vm vulnerability assessments justintime vm access adaptive application control container image scanning adaptive network hardening sql vulnerability assessment file integrity monitoring network map iot security and so down below you can see all these options here whether they're turned on or not let's take a we'll take a look at network map here in a moment so scope of azure defender so it has a lot of different plans for specific azure resources so we have azure defender for servers app service storage sql kubernetes container registry key vault resource manager dns open source relational databases and when you turn on azure defender all plans are activated we saw that under the advanced protection tabs then just to kind of highlight network map because this one's really cool it's a network map that provides a graphical graphical view with security overlays giving you recommendations and insights for hardening your network resources so using the map you can see the network topology of your azure workloads uh connections between your virtual machines and subnets and the capabilities to drill down from the map into a specific resource resources and the recommendations of those resources and then just the last thing i want to touch on here is hybrid cloud protection so azure defender can protect vms residing in other cloud service providers such as aws and gcp via azure arc so azure arc if you've never heard of it is a control plane that can manage compute resources across cloud service providers on premise and at the stage or at the edge and so for infrastructure you'll notice that it can handle vms uh kubernetes clusters sql servers and azure stack hcis hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at azure sentinel so azure sentinel is a scalable cloud native security information event management so siem and security orchestration automated response so soar a soar so azure sentinel delivers intelligent security analytics and threat intelligence across the enterprise providing a single solution for alert detection threat visibility uh proactive hunting and threat response so uh here's the big old wheel that azure sentinel likes to use to describe it and what's cool about this offering is it's both an siem and a source so you don't have to have two separate services talking about collect first so collect data at cloud scale across all users devices applications and infrastructure both on premise and in multiple clouds detect previously undetected threats and minimize false positives using microsoft analytics unparalleled threat intelligence investigate threats with artificial intelligence and hunt for suspicious activities at scale tapping into years of cyber security work at microsoft respond to incidents rapidly with builtin orchestration and automation of common tasks let's take a look at what azure sentinel can actually ingest from other data sources so we have a number of connectors here such as microsoft 365 defender office 365 or microsoft 365. that's how they like to call it now azure ad microsoft defender for identity microsoft cloud app security and common event formats would be syslog rest api windows event logs common event format so cef and trusted automated exchange for indicator information or also known as taxi let's take a look here at azure workbooks and this is really a feature of azure monitor but azure central allows you to create workbooks really easily so workbooks provide a flexible canvas for data analysis and creation of rich visual reports within the azure portal they allow you to tap into multiple data sources from across azure and combine them into unified interactive experiences it tells a story about the performance and availability about your applications and services so here's a big funny graph and uh here's another one but the idea is that these are kind of like living documents where you can uh visualize the monitoring stuff with like written text and visuals so workbooks are temporary workspaces to find a document like format with visualizations intertwined to help investigate and discuss performance if you've ever used jupiter notebooks it's kind of similar but for logging all right so let's take a look at some of the core features of azure sentinel so i'm just going to go through a bunch of them here so let's get to it so azure sentinel uses analytics to correlate alerts into incidents so over here we can see that we have a list of them and incidents are groups of related alerts that together create an actionable possible threat that you can investigate and resolve then there's automation orchestration so with sentinel you have solutions that provide a highly extensible architecture that enables scalable automation as new technologies and threat emerge and this is just using azure logic apps so it's a great way of not having to use any code but you can chain things over into different services and they have over 200 connectors so there's a lot you can do here for investigations uh the investigation tools help you understand the scope and find the root cause of a potential security threat and you can choose an entity on the interaction graph to ask interesting questions for a specific entity and drill down into that entity and its connections to get to the root cause that's root cause analysis should wrote that in there for you for hunting so azure sentinel's powerful hunting search query based tools is based on the miter framework now you know why i covered that earlier which enables you to proactively hunt for security threats across your organizational data sources before an alert is triggered after you discover which hunting query provides high value insights into the possible tax you can create custom detection rules based on your query and service those insights as alerts to your security instance responders while hunting you can create bookmarks from interesting events enabling you to return them later share them with others and group them with other coordinating events to create compelling incident investigations so there you go so just a quick description here of azure sentinel pricing so it has two pricing models capacity reservation this is build a fixed fee based on the selected tier enabling a predictive total cost for azure sentinel and pay as you go so build per gigabyte for the volume of data ingested for analysis in azure sentinel and stored in azure monitored log analytics workspace hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we are looking at microsoft 365 so it was formerly known as office 365 but you'll see me refer to it as office 365 because everyone's used to with that but it is a suite of business software packaged as soft as a sas offering so there are a bunch of services you probably recognize quite a few of them and you can access it at the portal.office.com most notable services would be sharepoint so that's a site collaboration shared company document drive outlook that's an email service word processor which is word powerpoint that's slideshows excel that's spreadsheets teams collaboration app for your organizations similar to slack so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at microsoft 365 defender which is a unified pre and post breach enterprise defense suite the natalie natively coordinates responses such as detection prevention investigation across endpoints identities emails and applications to provide integrated protection against sophisticated attacks so if you're looking for where the service is you'd open up portal.office.com you look at the the side menu and you're clicking on security that is where you will find microsoft 365 defender so defender is composed of the following services it has a secure score endpoint it's for office 365 identity app security and so that's just kind of a graphic to reiterate over those four okay so within microsoft 365 defender you get a secure score and this is a representation of your organization's security posture and your opportunity to improve it via improvement action so uh this is very similar to azure defenders secure score they just have a slightly different terminology to make it a little bit more uh company friendly people that aren't developers but over here we have the secure score and then you see the improvement actions looks very similar to what we saw before so within microsoft 365 we have endpoints and these are a set of destination ip addresses dns domain names and urls for microsoft 365 traffic on the internet so to optimize performance for m365 cloudbased services these endpoints need special handling by client browsers in the devices in your edge network and these devices include firewalls ssl brakes and inspect packet inspection devices and data loss protection dlp system so this is what it looks like again it's just ip addresses and dns domains so endpoints are grouped into four service areas exchange online sharepoint online and onedrive for business skype for business online and microsoft teams and uh m365 common office online so it's just a bunch of these things here on the left hand side but they specialize for those particular areas so now taking a look here at microsoft defender for endpoint is an enterprise endpoint security platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent detect investigate and respond to advanced threats and so defender for endpoint uses the following combination of technology built into windows 10 and microsoft cloud service so we have endpoint behavioral sensors so embedded in windows 10 these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from os and send this sensor data to your private isolated cloud instances of microsoft defender for endpoint then you have cloud security analytics so this is leveraging big data device learning and unique microsoft optic optics across the windows ecosystem enterprise cloud products such as office 365 and online assets behavioral signals are translated into insights detections and recommended responses to advanced threats then we have threat intelligence this is generated by microsoft hunters security teams and augmented by by threat intelligence providers by partners threat intelligence enables defender for endpoint to identify attack attacker tools techniques procedures and generate alerts when they are observed in collected sensor data so within uh microsoft 365 defender you have security reports and these are general security dashboards about security trends for m365 identities device and apps information is organized into cards on the dashboard so you have identities where we'll have users at risk and global admins then you have devices so devices at risk device compliance devices with active malware types of malware on devices malware on devices devices with malware detection users with malware detection then you have apps which have risk levels and so all this information can be reorganized so right now we have identities devices and apps but we could also have risk detection threads and configuration health so just to kind of tell you a little bit more here it's just imagine you have a bunch of these cards and they're broken down by all these categories here so you can have a bird's eye view of what's going on okay uh one particular report that is interesting to show you is the office 625 exchange one so this is email collaboration reports so just kind of gives you statistics over time so that's a viewer to drill down into a particular type of report here um and so you can kind of see things like you know spam detection over time spoof detection things like that okay so m365 defender for identity is a cloudbased security solution that leverages your onpremise active directory signals to identify detect and investigate advanced threats compromise identities and malicious insider actions directed at your organization it detects advanced attacks in hybrid environments to monitor users entity behaviors and activities with learning based analytics protect user identities and credentials and stored in active directory identify investigate suspicious user activities and advanced attacks throughout the kill chain provide clear incident information on simple timeline for fast triage i had the hardest time trying to find any kind of screenshot for this and i just kind of gave up so i mean you have the gist of it but it's nice to have a visual you know so microsoft defender for identity monitors your domain controllers by capturing and parsing network traffic and leveraging windows events directly from your domain controllers then analyzes the data for attacks and threats so here is kind of the architecture of it so you know we have our domain controller over here then we have microsoft defender identity and then it's going to go to our cas mcas so that we can do some analysis and stuff later on and you could pass it off over to your siem or azure sentinel and things like that so utilizing profiling deterministic detection machine learning behavioral algorithms defender for identity learns about your network enables detection of anomalies and warns you of suspicious activities so microsoft defender for office 365 protects against advanced threats by email messages links teams sharepoint onedrive for business and other clients and protection is provided via reports threat investigations thread responses threat protection policies and there's three available subscriptions we have the exchange online protection the defender for office 365 plan one and plan two and office 365 security builds on the core protections offered by eop so eop is present in any subscription where exchange online mailboxes can be found so go in more detail here for eop cloudbased filtering service that protects your organizations against spam malware and other email threats defender office p1 safe attachments checks email attachments for malicious content safe links links are scanned for each click a safe link remains accessible but malicious links are blocked protection for sharepoint onedrive microsoft teams identifies and blocks malicious files in team sites and document libraries antiphishing protection so it detects attempts to impersonate your users internal or custom domains realtime detection a realtime report that allows you to identify and analyze recent threats for defender for office p2 i don't know why i didn't highlight that one but that's how it goes includes defender office p1 features so we have threat trackers latest intelligence and cyber security issues takes counter measurements before an actual threat threat explorer so realtime reports that allows you to identify and analyze recent threats automated investigation and response also known as air is a set of security playbooks that can be launched automatically start an automatic investigation provide detailed reports recommend action security teams can can approve i'm describing what a playbook is there so attack simulator so run realistic attack scenarios in your organization to identify vulnerabilities so you can see that p2 is very very good a bit more detail on the eop here is an on is a cloudbased filtering service that protects your organization from spam malware and other evil threats i know we just said it but here is kind of the graphic and so this has features for antimalware inbound antispam uh outbound spam connection filtering antifishing antispoofing zero outer auto purge zap for delivered malware spam and phishing messages preset security policies 10 allow block list allow block lists for message senders directory based edge blocking so dbeb mail flow rules accepted domains message training and more i just couldn't fit them all on the screen but i just wanted to show you how valuable exchange online protection is and that's one reason why you don't want to be using i mean you could but like this is one of the advantages of exchange over gmail okay so microsoft cloud app security mcas is a cloud access security broker so casb that sits between the user and the cloud service provider to gateway access in real time to cloud services if you're getting tired of the initialisms so am i because there's just so many uh mcas is built on top of the four principles of the microsoft cloud app security framework discover and control the the use of shadow it so identify cloud apps ias pass services used by your organization investigate usage patterns uh patterns assess uh and risk levels assesses and risk levels and business readiness for more than 16 000 sas apps against more than 80 risks starts managing them to ensure security and compliance then you have protect your sensitive information anywhere in the cloud understand classify protect the exposure of sensitive information at rest leverage out the box policies and automated processes to apply control in real time across all cloud apps protect against cyber threats and anomalies to detect unusual behavior across cloud apps to identify ransomware compromise croppers users or rogue applications analyze high risk usage and remediate automatically to limit the risks to your organization assess the compliance of your cloud apps so assesses if your cloud app meets relevant compliance requirements including regulatory compliance and industry standards prevent data leaks to noncompliant apps and limit access to regulated data more information we're not done cloud app security integrates visibly with your cloud by uh using cloud discovery to map and identify your cloud environment and the cloud apps using your organization so just take note over here okay sanctioning and unsanctioning apps in your cloud using easy to deploy app connectors that take advantage of provider apis for visibility governments of your apps that you connect to using conditional access uh app control protection to gain realtime visibility and control over access and activities within your cloud apps helping you have continuous control by setting and then continually finetuning policies office 365 cloud app security is a subset of microsoft cloud app security so there is a variant here for us and this has threat protection based on user activity logs discover shadow it for apps with similar functionality to office 65 offering yeah get this for no extra cost if you have azure premium one okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're going to take a look here at microsoft endpoint manager so microsoft intune and configuration manager were two separate products and they were merged into a single service called microsoft endpoint manager because they're so darn similar but they had different product uh marketing all this stuff and just got really confusing so they just rolled it into one so microsoft intune is used for managing the security of mobile devices configuration manager is used to manage desktop servers and laptops this can all be accessed via the endpoint.microsoft.com that's where the microsoft endpoint manager admin center is we'll just talk about intune configuration manager is pretty similar so we don't need to go into details about that but microsoft intune is a mobile device and mobile application manager so mdm mam found within the microsoft endpoint manager so it can manage devices manage security baselines use policies to manage device security use device compliance policies configure conditional access integration with microsoft defender endpoint role based access controls and it integrates with azure id mobile threat defenders admx templates win32 custom lob apps and more so microsoft intune can be used to manage onpremise infrastructure via intune connectors which i think that's pretty cool intune connectors for active directory intune certificate certificate connector and there we go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at the concept of regulatory compliance so what is compliance it's conforming to rules such as a specification policy standard or law and regulatory compliance is an organization that takes an effort to comply with relevant laws policies and regulations so regulatory compliance can vary at the following level so federal state political and economic union and international organization so why do we have regulatory compliance will governments want to protect its citizens data that is collected by companies and organizations what are compliance controls well those are internal control mechanisms that need to be in place to detect prevent and correct compliance issues so public standards and policies document procedures uh training monitoring internal audits so what can uh they do to uh enforce these things so they have or the idea is why like what will the measures of regulatory compliance enforce so citizens get the right to access their data anytime the right to correct or uh or delete their data if needed retention periods that for a minimum or maximum time data should be stored enabling governments and regulatory agencies the right to access and examine data when necessary defining rules for what data can be processed and how that should be done okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're going to take a look here at the m365 compliance center so this provides easy access to data and tools that you need to manage your organizational compliance needs so here is a screenshot and the way you get there is compliance.microsoft.com sometimes these things are hard to find so you got to know what these domains are so some of the features here would be compliance score audits activity alerts solution catalog data classification ediscovery insider risk management records management and that is not the definitive list there's a lot of stuff in here don't worry we are going to spend quite a bit of time around compliance center in this course so you know we're going to dive deeper on some of these things if you want to access compliance center you need to be either a global administrator compliance administrator or a compliance data administrator hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at the azure trust center and this is a public facing website portal providing easy access to privacy security regulatory compliance information so yeah it's just a simple website but one of the cool features here is audit reports so auto reports is an independent audit report for microsoft cloud services which provides information about compliance with data protection standards and regulatory requirements so you'll get reports for iso sock nist fedramp gdpr and so you've got a big old list there of docs and pdfs you can download you can open them up and then see how microsoft and azure is being compliant hey it's andrew brown from exam pro we're going to take a look here at compliance manager so this is an at a glance summary for of the shared responsibility model for microsoft and your organization now i got a bit confused because i use it in one place and i found it somewhere else but it turns out there's two versions of this there's one in the microsoft trust center or azure trust center which is the classic compliance manager and then there's the m365 compliance center the compliance manager the screenshots here from the classic but the information is the same okay so risk assessment workflow and management tools is one of the things you get with this so provides task assignment and verification to help governance risk compliance teams and iet departments work together to streamline internal compliance activities you get intelligent tracking this understands common similar compliance activities across multiple standards and regulations to reduce your organization costs and efforts from regulation to audit by applying a single activity to multiple assessments or controls each uh each assessed control will be labeled preventative detective or corrective and will be mandatory or discretionary as assessments for gdpr uh nist and iso for office 365 for azure we have gdbr iso 2718 and then 2701 and hipaa and so this is what it kind of looks like here is the card that shows the compliance you have a compliance score now i imagine and maybe we'll look at this moment but m365 compliance center will be all around uh m365 assets and maybe the classic one combines both azure and microsoft but we'll have to investigate that so clicking into an assessment will give you a detailed list of actionable controls so here you see the controls and it has a score and you can assign it to someone and etc so yeah there you go okay since compliance manager has two variants i figured just to avoid confusion we should take a closer look at it here i have the microsoft 65 compliance center open at the top here you see compliance manager and so you have an overview improvement action solution so here you can see a compliance score and then here it has the improved actions these are really slow loading so i just opened another tab here so down below you can see the improvement actions um you know they generally look the same you can assign it to a user etc i don't know what we get if we click into it let's take a look again very slow loading um yeah so how to implement and then more information you can make implement implementation notes they have testing standard regulation documents so there's stuff you can do here to collect an audit to make sure that you are doing what you're supposed to be doing over in the service trust center you can drop it down you see classic compliance manager this is where we just were so for classic you'd connect it to your azure account just scroll down you'd see these cards here so you can click into a card and just expand it and see what kind of things you need to do there so there you go that is the two variants of compliance manager hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at compliance programs and so there's a lot of different ones uh that are for azure but i figured we should go through some of them so you get a bit more familiarity with this same stuff we covered in the az900 but if you didn't take that certification this is a great opportunity to see them firsthand okay so the first one here is the criminal justice information services this stands for uh this initialism here is cjis so any state or local agency that wants access to the fbi's database is required to adhere to the uh cjis security policy then you have the cloud security alliance csa star certification this is an independent third party assessment of a cloud provider security posture then you have the gdpr this is a european privacy law imposes new rules on companies governments agencies nonprofits and other orgs that offer goods and services to people in the european union or that collect analyze data tied to eu residents this one is a very well known one because even if you don't live in the eu you still basically have to enforce this on your website this goes for everybody which is if people want to uh delete their data they should be able to they should know what kind of data is being collected etc we have the eu model clauses this is the contractual guarantees around transfers of personal data outside the eu you have hipaa so this is a u.s federal law that regulates patient protected health information you have the iso 27018 this is a code of practice covering the processing of personal information by cloud service providers you have um multitier cloud security this is operational singapore security management standard it's a common center that that cloud service providers can apply to address customer concerns about security and confidence confidential uh led of data in the cloud and impact of business of using cloud services then you have socks service organization controls there's sock one two and three so these are independent thirdparty examination reports that demonstrate how the company achieves key compliance controls and objectives generally uh tech companies are going for sock to compliance um so we'll go into the next section here we have nist cyber security framework this is a voluntary framework that consists of standards guidelines and best practices to manage cyber security related risks then you have like government specific ones so like there's one for canada there's one for all sorts of countries but this is a uk specific one it's called gcloud and it's a cloud computing certification for services used by government entities in the united kingdom and then you have fips so federal information processing standard this is a u.s and canada government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at microsoft information protection also known as mip and this is a collection of features within m365 compliance to help you discover classify and protect sensitive information wherever it travels or resides so the idea here is that we have this diagram and we have a four specific domains of things around our data and so the first is know your data the second is protect your data the third is prevent data loss and the fourth is govern your data which will be its own category here is kind of part of it so we'll get into it next okay all right so let's look at the three of the four domains here for the microsoft information protection these are features found within the microsoft compliance center so the first is know your data understand your data landscape and identify important data across your hybrid environment so one feature would be sensitive information types so identify sensitive data by using builtin or custom regular expressions or a function corroborative evidence includes keywords confidence levels and proximity we have builtin sensitive labels then there's and you have custom ones probably as well yeah so then there's train uh trainable classifiers so these identify sense of data by using examples of the data you're interested in rather than identifying elements in the item so pattern matching and you can use builtin classifiers or train a classifier with your own content so you have trainable classifiers here for data classification this is a graphical identification of items in your organization that have a sensitive label a retention label or have been classified you can also use this information to gain insights into the actions that your users are taking uh taking on these items so that's the content explorer the activity explorer all of these three features we will look at in granular detail okay so don't worry if they don't make sense right now the second part is protect your data so apply flexible protection actions that include encryption access restriction and visual markings so sensitivity labels the azure information protection unified labeling client double key encryption office 365 message encryption uh service encryption with customer key sharepoint information rights management irm rights management connector azure information protection unified labeling scanner microsoft cloud app security microsoft information protection sdk most of these you don't need to know but we will definitely cover sensitivity labels that's for sure then we have prevent data loss so these prevent accidental over sharing of sensitive information so that would be dlps endpoint data loss protection there is a chrome extension that does uh compliance compliance for you so it's built into your browser the m365 data loss prevention for onpremise scanner protection sensitive information in microsoft teams chat channel channels and messages we'll probably look at a more closer look at the last one there okay all right so out of the four domains the the last one here is for governance and this one particular one is actually more of a subset and so that's why we give it the microsoft information governance title here mig and it is a collection of features to govern your data for compliance or regulatory they have this nice graphic here to kind of show the scope of this here but we'll first talk about information governance so this is retention policies and retention labels import service archive third party data inactive mailboxes and then you have records management this is a single solution for email documents that incorporates retention schedules and requirements in a file plan that supports the full lifecycle of your content with records declaration retention and disposition so sensitive information types are classifications or categories of data by sensitivity so within the m365 compliance data classification feature you can get a breakdown of the distribution of sensitive info types so here imagine you have a bunch of documents and you said hey tell me what you found in these documents and there it gives it kind of a breakdown these types of identified base these are identified based on regular expressions or a function and there's hundreds of builtin uh information types so ip address eu passport number credit card number azure storage account key aba routing number canada health service number latvian driver license number netherlands tax identification number so it's a huge list these are used the sensitive information types are used in data loss retention so dlp policies sensitive labels retention labels insider risk management communication compliance auto labeling policies generally the first thing you're going to do with your data classification is get your sensitive information types okay and you can create your own too so if there's something that doesn't meet your needs you'll have to write your own regular expression but you can have whatever you want okay another feature found in data classification within the m365 compliance center are trainable classifiers let's talk about what training is and classifiers are so a classifier is a machine learning model that can take records of data and classify categorize by applying a label from a predetermined list of categories then you have training and this is the active teaching and machine learning model how to learn by providing it large amounts of data that is already labeled it uses the labeled data to tell if its predictions are similar to the ones provided so within m365 compliance center there are two kinds of trainable classifiers pretrained classifiers so ready to use classifiers with five pretrained classifiers we'll talk about those five in a moment you don't need to provide any data used for training meets any general use cases and you have custom trainable classifiers when you have your own kind of documents when you have specific business requirements but you'll have to provide the training data so the five are resumes source code harassment profanity and threat so here they are in the actual service itself okay another feature in the data classification within m365 compliance center is content explorer so this is a drill down to find emails or documents that have been labeled based on sensitive information types sensitivity labels or retention labels so the idea here is you have broad categories on the lefthand side where it says sensitive do you see the three categories information types labels and retention labels let me get out my pen here over here all right and then what you'll do is click into one and then they'll have more or specific actual items underneath and you'd click into one of those and then from there you can go and it's on the right hand pane over here which is this you can go and explore different documents and files to identify that kind of information okay the other explorer here is the activity explorer and this helps discover which file labels were changed and which files were modified so monitors label activity cross exchange sharepoint onedrive endpoint devices so here is a great visual just to get an idea so here you have filter so activity location user the type of filter you want and then you can just see so see it says labeled applied here so you can see that these labels were applied this gray is for files created files copy the cloud is a little orange here uh we have the green false copy to removable media is over here in the green so you get an idea of what this does okay so sensitivity labels allow you to apply a label to your document or email and the most common way is via builtin dropdowns within office 365 products i actually tried using these but i guess i'd have to do a lot of setup to get these and so i just had to grab previously existing screenshots but here's one for word here's one for excel and here's one from outlook so the idea is that you do do your business as per usual but you'd have to go ahead and classify that information into a particular sensitivity okay so sensitivity labeling makes it easy to apply uh or to do content marketing or encryption so content marketing would be like watermarks or warnings that are applied to the header and footer of a document so notice here you know you turn it on and you can say add this watermark with this customized text add this header add this footer i think you can even customize some of the colors very limited but it does the job okay the other one is encryption so apply encryption and specify which users and groups may decrypt and other finetuned permissions so the idea is you would turn the encryption on then you would select the users groups or et cetera who could do it then they have these broad categories and so this particular one is for email but here you can see that you know are you allowed to forward the email are you allowed to reply to the email can you save the email are you allowed to view it so it's very finetuned it's not just encryption even though that's what it's called so within the m365 compliance center under classifications you can see the distribution of sensitive labels applied to documents and emails or based on location so this gives you a visual as to understanding like where these labels are so here on the lefthand side is what has been applied and then here is where they are all right so sensitive labels can be used in providing protection settings that include encryption and content markings protect content in office apps across different platforms and devices protect content in thirdparty apps and services protect containers extend sensitive sensitivity labels to power bi extend sensitivity labels to assets in azure extend sensitivity labels to thirdparty apps and services and classify content without using any protection settings let's take a look here at label policies for sensitivity labels so in order to use sensitivity labels they need to be published alongside a label policy so a label policy determines who can use the label and other conditions so the idea is you say okay well which users can use these labels and then here are some of the settings here so notice below i'm going to get my pen out here so users must provide justification to remove a label or lower classification requires user to apply a label to the email or document provides user with a link to a custom help page so choose the users and groups that the label can see so labels can be published to specific users distribution groups m365 groups and azure ad and more so you apply default label a label to all the new emails and documents that can be specified for users and groups to create users can always change the default label if they believe the document or email has been mislabeled require justifications for label changes so if a user wants to remove a label or repeat it admins can require the user to provide a valid justification to complete the action the user will be prompted to provide an explanation for why the label should be changed then we have require user to apply a label some mandatory mandatory labeling it ensures a label is applied before users can save the documents send emails or create new sites or groups and we have link users to custom help pages so it helps users to understand what the different different labels mean and how they should be used let's take a look at retention labels and retention policies so retention labels ensure data is held for a specific duration to meet a regulatory compliance or industry best practice and retention policies are used to assign the same retention settings to content at the site level or mailbox level and we do have some nice visuals uh there the first one at the top just getting my pen out here top retention labels applied to content and then the locations of those labels not too different from sensitivity labels so we didn't have to spend too much time on it but it's pretty clear you're just holding on to data for a particular amount of time so what is records management well this is when an organization's process of managing uh their information throughout its life cycle and record management helps organization meet regulatory compliance legal requirements uh so a life cycle of a record would look something like identifying classifying storing securing retrieving tracking destroying and preserving and so a record represents labeled information or content and it's life cycle to be managed so uh within the n365 compliance center you have record management and this enables you to do label content as a record migrating managing retention plans and with file plan manager establishing retention and deletion policies within the record label triggering eventbased retention reviewing and validating disposition proof of record deletion exporting information about disposed items setting specific permissions for record manager functions and organizations for label content applies to the following so restrictions are put in place to block certain activities activities are logged proof of disposition is kept at the end of the retention period i could not find any screenshots for this and it was so hard to figure out how to even see it myself so i'm sorry but we're gonna have to deal with text for this okay so within m365 compliance center they have data loss protection dlp policies that prevent data loss so dlp policies allow you to identify and monitor and automatically protect sensitive information m365 help users learn how compliance works view dlp reports glp policies are composed of conditions so these are matching content before the rules enforced actions this is what action to take when the condition is found locations where the policy should be applied all right so not too complicated but there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at insider risk management and so this is another uh service that's underneath the m365 compliance center so insider risk management minimizes internal risks by enabling you to detect investigate and act on malicious and inadvertent activities in your organization so define the types of risk to identifying detecting organization including acting on cases and escalating cases to the microsoft advance ediscovery if needed so inside risk management is looking to detect leaks of sensitive data and data spillage confidentiality violations ip theft fraud insider trading regulatory compliance violations and so over here on the right we have the actual workflow for it and notice it is policy alerts triage investigate action the last three being all tied to an insider risk case and so the features we're going to cover literally maps to this workflow here these five things let's jump into it first looking at policies so policies are predefined templates and policy conditions that define what triggering events and risk indicators are examined in your organization so here's the here's the page itself you see you have warnings recommendations and policies and down below are your defined policies and we can drill down into those uh we'll be able to set alerts on them that's when they're talking about triggering events we're talking about alerts and so that's the next step here so alerts automatically generated by risk indicators that match policy conditions and are displayed in the alerts dashboard and so we can identify the status of an existing alerts and new alerts that need actions such as status severity time detected case and case status so down below you'll see the status the activity sense activity severity the case that it's part of the case status all right because these get grouped into case which we'll talk about here in a moment but if we want to uh dig deeper we can click in any into any of these alerts and this is where we're going to get triage so this allows reviewers uh to see detailed information about the activities identified within a policy and the user activity associated with the policy that was matched so you'll be able to see the severity alert and review the user profile information so it's a bit more information here but what's going to be really useful is actually investigate because that is a holistic view of all the alerts and information that have been tied under a case so the case dashboard provides an allup view of all active cases open cases over time and case statistics for organization reviewers can quickly filter case by study and the date the case was opened and the date the case was last updated cases are created for alerts that require deeper review and investigation of the activity details and the circumstances around the policy match so the primary investigation tools are user activity activity explorer content explorer and case notes so there you go another service that's within the m365 compliance center there's a lot of them in there is communication compliance and that helps minimize communication risks by helping you detect capture and act on inappropriate messages in your organization so you have predefined and custom policies that allow you to scan internal and external communications for policy matches so they can be examined by designated reviewers reviewers can investigate scanned email microsoft teams yammer or thirdparty communications in your organization and take appropriate action to make sure they're compliant with your organization's message standards so communication compliance can can scan increasing types of communication channels increasing the volume of message data regulatory enforcement of the risk of fines scenarios of communication compliance could be corporate policies so like acceptable use and ethical standards avoiding harassment or use of inappropriate offensive language then there's risk management so manage potential legal exposure and risk under authorized communications and conflicts of interest about confidential projects such as upcoming acquisitions mergers earnings disclosures reorganizations leader leadership team changes regulatory compliance so supervisory or oversight process of messaging that's inappropriate for the industry regulatory authority this one again it's hard to get screenshots of these services because they all require you to have trial and full information and microsoft was pretty sparse on this but this service does a lot but when you look at it doesn't seem like it does okay so it has this little workflow here where we have configure investigate and then there's the continuous monitoring so we'll quickly go through here so configure is identify your compliance requirements and configure application or applicable communication compliance policies so offensive or threatening language sensitive information regulatory compliance conflict of interest custom policy for investigate issues detected as matching your communication compliance policies alerts issue management document review reviewing user activity history filters so for remediate you have remediate communication compliance issues you've investigated to resolve tag a message notify the user escalate to another reviewer mark as a false positive remove messages in team and escalate for investigation then you have monitor and reports of communication compliance dashboard widgets export logs and event events record in the unified audit logs continually evaluate and improve your compliance posture so there you go that's communication compliance hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're looking at the concept of information barriers so information barriers are policies that admins can configure to prevent individuals or groups from communicating with each other so information barriers can be applied to microsoft teams onedrive for business sharepoint online and more and information barriers only support twoway restrictions so maybe a use case would be like your school but you don't want one student to see the records of another student or a lawyer cannot obtain client data from another lawyer so you know for microsoft teams information barriers policies can restrict the following searching for a user adding a member to a team starting a chat session with someone and starting with a group chat and inviting someone to join a meeting sharing a screen placing a phone call sharing a file with another user uh access to the file through sharing links so there's a lot of restrictions and that's great for microsoft teams where you do this i think it's in the m365 compliance center i really tried hard to find this but it's just like this course like i can't find anything but it's something you need to know so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at privileged access management so it protects your organization from breaches and helps to meet compliance best practices by limiting sand limiting standing access to sensitive data or access to critical configuration settings so this gives you justintime access rules uh and there are uh that are implemented for tasks that need of elevated permissions and let an organization operate with zero standing access enabling privileged access management for exchange online in microsoft 365 allows your organization to operate with zero standing privileges and provides a layer of defense against standing administrative access vulnerabilities so here you can create approvers group enable privileged access management create an access policy submit approval privilege access requests and that's all the steps there if you just want to see it there again okay so customer lockbox protects sensitive data when working with microsoft support engineers by enforcing a request system to view custom private information to resolve an m365 related issue so customer lockbox supports requests to access data for exchange online sharepoint online onedrive for business and you need to turn on customer lock box in order for this uh to work and the support engineer must make an email request and a pr and it must be approved by you before they can access it and the support engineer only has access for the minimum amount of time that they need it for and an audit trail of access is maintained so that way you know if there was tampering stuff that evidence is there so here is an example of a request that is pending your approval so the support engineer is saying hey i need to get into whatever it is and and you say accept or deny okay so there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look at ediscovery and this is again another service found within the m365 compliance center so ediscovery stands for electronic electronic discovery and this is the process of identifying and delivering electronic information that can be used as evidence in legal cases so ediscovery tools in m365 to search content in exchange online m365 groups and in teams in sharepoint online onedrive for business sites skype for business conversations yammer teams and so there are two uh options we have core in advance we'll definitely walk through those two but m365 provides the following ediscovery tools so content search core ediscovery advanced ediscovery okay so we will get into these now so core ediscovery in m365 provides a basic ediscovery tool that organizations can use to search and export content in m365 and office 365 so you can use query discovery to place an ediscovery hold on content locations such as your mailboxes sharepoint onedrive and microsoft teams so nothing is needed to deploy query discovery but there are some prerequisites that you have to do before you can complete for your organization okay so those would be things like verifying and assigning appropriate licensing assign ediscovery permissions create a core ediscovery case and then from there you can use the holds the search for content and export and download the search results okay let's take a closer look here at content search and holds for ediscovery workflows so to perform a content search you can create a new search specify the locations provide keywords and conditions and if you leave the keywords blank it will return all the items and conditions i just want you to notice a few things here you can also search by id list here we have our location so we have exchange point sharepoint exchange i think teams is supposed to show up there i'm not sure why it's not there for my use case you could also search within a hold so you have your keyword you can leave that blank and they have a lot of conditions like i cut this off but it's like super long okay so then we have holds and so the difference here is that a whole will preserve content uh for as long as the hold exists okay and so you are being you're able to basically search the exact same things um with the exception i think yammer groups is added there the con is preserved until you remove the content location from the hold or until you delete the hold after you create an ediscovery hold it may take up to 24 hours for the hole to take effect okay so let's take a look here at advanced ediscovery workflow so this workflow builds on the existing core discovery discovery workflow but it's just a lot more advanced it's an endtoend workflow to preserve collect review analyze and export content that's relevant to your organization's internal external investigation it also lets your legal teams manage the entire legal hold notification workflow to communicate with custodians involved in a case so the builtin workflow for advanced ediscovery just described below hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at m365 audit so what is an audit well that's an investigation uh into a security event forensic investigation internal investigation or compliance obligation an audit would involve capturing recording retaining unified audit log and uh m365 has two solutions so we have a basic audit so enabled by default thousands of searchable audited events 90day audit record retention expert audit records to a csv and this tool shows up in the compliance center it also comes with the activity api so it's just a way of interacting with it and you can also use it in powershell with the search unified audit log commandlet then there are is the uh advanced audit so this includes all the base basic features of audit features but it has retention policies longer retention periods high value and crucial events and higher bandwidth to the office 365 management activity api okay hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look at resource locks so as an admin you may need to lock a subscription resource group or resource to prevent other users from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources so this is within azure here i have a resource group and i can set it either to read only and so this will allow the authorized users to who can read a resource but they can't delete or update the resource and then you have the delete so authorized users can still read and modify resource but they can't delete the resource if you notice there's a bit of inconsistency with the naming where i have read only and cannot delete it's because this is what they are in the api and this is what they are in the actual portal okay let's take a look here at resource tags so a tag is a key and value pair that you can assign to azure resources so it's as simple as a name and a value or a key and a value and so some tag examples could be a department so a status a team an environment a project a location and so tags are really important because they allow you to filter your inventory in a lot of different ways so they allow you to organize based on resource management so specific workloads environments like developer environments maybe cost management and optimization so cost tracking budgets alerts operations management so business commitments sla operations mission uh critical services security which is the one we're interested in for this course so a classification of data and security impact governance and regulatory compliance another one we care about automation workflow automation okay let's take a look here at azure blueprints and this enables quick creation of governed subscription so you can compose artifacts based on common or organizational based patterns into reusable blueprints the service is designed to help with environment setup so blueprints are a declarative way to orchestrate the deployment of various resource templates and other artifacts such as role assignments policy assignments arm templates resource groups and so azure blueprints service is backed by the globally distributed azure cosmodb and blueprint objects are replicated to multiple azure regions a comparison is between arm templates and blueprints because they appear to do the same thing and so nearly everything you'd want to include for deployment in azure blueprint can be accomplished with an arm template but with arm templates they are stored either locally or in source control there's no active connection or relationship to the arm template but with blueprints the relationship between the blueprint definition what should be deployed in the blueprint assignment what was deployed is a huge um advantage here especially if you are care about this from the sense of compliance or security because then we have the exact idea what is going on with their stuff so you can also upgrade several subscriptions at once that are governed by the same blueprint so azure blueprint supports improved tracking and auditing of deployment so that is the difference there okay so azure policies enforces organizational standards to assess compliance at scale and policies do not restrict access but they only observe for compliance so here's a list of builtin policies that you use right away and if you can squint here i know it's a small screenshot but do we see fedramp nist things like that and notice that they map over to they might map over to specific services or maybe it's regulatory compliance it's going to vary for that stuff okay so the idea is that a policy is actually just a policy definition and this is just a json file users describe business rules to control access resources you have policy assignments so this is the scope of a policy effect so it can be assigned to a user resource group or management group then you have policy parameters these are values you can pass into a policy definition or so or or your policies are flexible for reuse then you have initiative definitions this is an initial definition is a collection of policy definitions that can assign so let's say you want a group of policies to enforce pci dss compliance so notice here the reason i have that arrows because we're looking at whoops we're looking at the policy type over here so that's just these are all just one policy definition files each of these are a single file and then the initiatives over here these are a collection okay now in terms of viewing noncompliant resources once the policy is assigned it will evaluate for the compliance state periodically so here you can see that we have a compliance tab and in this particular case this is the policy that we uh have here and we can see that it's not being compliant okay so it's not super complicated but there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at the microsoft cloud adoption framework for azure and the idea behind this white paper and i call it a white paper because that's what it is even if it's in this kind of website format but it's here to help organizations utilize a stepbystep process to migrate their workloads over to azure so if you scroll on down here i mean they describe all these uh categories here but this is the visual here so the idea is you're going to define a strategy you're going to create a plan you're going to get ready so ready would be setting up a landing zone then you'd have to adopt either by migrating or innovating and then up between these steps you're gonna govern and manage so where does security fit in this well on the lefthand side you'll notice there's a whole section it's weird that it doesn't show up in here but there's a whole section on security and so there's security and governance and that's generally what we're interested in but we just click into the secure section uh you can see here uh it talks about uh things in the security disciplines like risk insights security integrations business resilience and then the security disciplines that we need to have if you scroll on down and this is what i found the most useful is that this particular graph kind of shows you the type of roles uh in your community that you're gonna need so like uh when in the plan stage like who you're gonna need in your team in order to fulfill this to the end right so i guess you could say security happens throughout the entire cloud.option framework but yeah you're just going to need different kinds of people to help you for different sections okay they do emphasize on three things like the xero trust uh model which we all know about uh i don't know what open group is the security disciplines map closely to the zero trust components in the core principles white paper uh published by the open group where microsoft actively participates okay so it's based it's basically a white paper another white paper uh that is just more about uh zero trust models other than this cyber security framework which is a pretty standardized framework uh used across the board for all csps so you know um you just need to know what the cloud adoption framework is it is uh pretty useful to go through and read this but there's a lot of stuff okay and so we've covered a lot of this in the course so um you know it's up to you if you want to do it it's definitely an auxiliary read but there you go hey this is andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at the azure well architecture framework and this describes the best practices for building workloads on azure categorized into five pillars so we have cost optimization operational excellence performance efficiency reliability and security uh if you've ever seen the aws well wellarcaded framework it's pretty similar like the pillars are onetoone okay so cost optimization is managing costs to maximize the value delivered operation processes that keep a system running in production the ability of the system to adapt changes in the load uh reliability the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function and the last pillar security protecting applications and data from threats so for the topics covered security pillar we have role of security security design principles regulatory compliance reduce organizational risk administration application services government risk and compliance identity access management network security and containment security operations and there's a lot in here and i actually went through all of these categories and i did summaries on them uh but like it's just not fun to read through all this stuff and i don't feel that uh the course is gonna test you on it but i just wanted to show you that i actually did do it i went through it all um and so you know maybe i'll include these in the downloadable um lecture notes so if you do want to go through it and you just want a quick summary of all these categories but i just went through it to see if there was something that seemed really really unnecessary but you know it's just it's just information overload so i'm not going to read through all this because we'd be here for like 1520 minutes uh but i just wanted to know that that resource is available to you and you might want to just skim through it to you know get a general sense of security in azure okay so the microsoft security best practices is a collection of best practices that provide clear actionable guidance for securityrelated decisions this was previously known as the azure security compass and so uh the best practices are packaged into a series of videos or you can download the powerpoint slides and so the pro the best practice covers the following governance risk compliance security operations identity and access management network security containment information protection and storage application services and this is about 150 slides now the videos are pretty dull i wouldn't watch them but the slides are amazing and i'm definitely going to show you after this video we're gonna go take a peek at that uh uh slideshow uh but you know there there's the best practices the well architect framework the cloud adoption framework there's a lot of coverage that's in the same place i feel that this one this particular resource should have been on the exam guide but anyway i'm going to show it to you because you're just going to see you're going to go wow i'm going to spend some time reading here and it's going to probably help you solidify all the knowledge you've learned in this course okay all right so what i did here is i just typed in microsoft security best practices and below you can see that there's these guidance if you click into them here's all the videos it would take forever to watch these things and they're really padded out they're just talking way too much but you know if you're looking to dive in a particular section you can go in there and check it out really good auxiliary resource for this course but i do cover everything so it's not necessary but if you're interested you should do it here you have a downloadable presentational slide that is what i did here i just want to show you how much they've done in this this is crazy like you go through it and so a lot of stuff we covered right but they just have really great visuals for the stuff and even stuff that we didn't covered so but there's like a lot of slides like i'm just going to click through here just to show you what i'm talking about a lot of these show up like you know the responsibility model we covered that uh these things i think i saw them in the cloud adoption framework so they're really pulling resources everywhere and creating very strong visuals for it uh but again you know it's a little bit overkill um for um you know if this was the the main study course material but yeah just browse through it and see what interests you okay hey it's andrew brown from exam pro and we're taking a look here at shared access signatures so sas is a url that grants restricted access rights to azure storage the share uh you can share the uri to grant client temporary access to specific set of permissions so you have a few different types of access signatures so account level sas so access to resources in one or more of the storage services service level sas so access to the single storage account by using the storage account key user delegated sas these are access to storage accounts using azure 80 credentials limited only to blob and containers microsoft considers this method the best practice for accessing via the sas so you know you use that one if that's the case a shared access signature comes in different formats so you have ad hoc sas the start time expiry time permissions are part of the uri any type of sas can be an ad hoc sas then you have service sas with stored access policies a stored access policy is defined on a resource container limited to the blob container table queues or file shares the stored access policy can be associated to multiple sas to manage constraints i know all these options seem really confusing but that's just what it is it's a lot more clear when you use it because you're just checkboxing stuff right um so the uri format itself is the blob your eye then there's the version number the start time the expiration the storage resources the permissions the signature they're not going to ask you to identify this stuff on the exam i'm just showing you the structure of it because it's a really long string and it's good to know what it looks like and yeah this is all those check boxes i'm talking about so you just go in here and you say i want to generate out a an sas you say what do i want it for what are the resource types what's the lab permissions what's the time frame what protocol do i want do i want particular ips you have your signing key and you generate it and it's that simple so let's take a look here at cores which stands for cross origin resource sharing it is an http header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins so whether it be a domain a scheme a report that it's owned from which a browser should permit loading of resources so you have a website and on your website you're going to have a piece of content so maybe it is a embedded script and so the thing is where does that script originate from so if it's from the same domain that's con then it's going to be of same origin as the server now you could also embed let's say an image and that image could come from a different domain and now it's technically cross origin and so unless you permit it using a special header such as access control allowed origin it would be automatically blocked because it's there to protect you right so cores restricts which websites may access data to be loaded onto a page and so the way it does that is through http headers so you'll have request headers like origin or access control request method request headers and for response you'd have access control allowed origin credentials headers max age allowed methods and headers the ones we see most common it'll be this one here the origin so where are you from i'm from domain one and then for the headers it would be like what do you want to allow so here it's a wild card but you could put in uh uh like wild card and then a domain name you could put multiple domain names in there to say these are the ones that are allowed to embed things on my website or be able to be loaded on my particular website and you have methods that's a very common one like is it allowed to do get post put patch options stuff like that okay let's take a look here at the microsoft security development life cycle the sdl and so this is an industryleading software security assurance process and it's a microsoft wide initiative and a mandatory process since 2004 the sdl has played a critical role in betting security and privacy in microsoft software and culture so building security into each stl phase of development lifecycle helps you catch issues earlier and it helps you reduce your developer development cost so this is all about pushing left we talked that in security it means doing things a lot earlier and so it has
