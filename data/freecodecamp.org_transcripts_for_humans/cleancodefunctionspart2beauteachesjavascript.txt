00:00 - clean code functions part two cing code
00:03 - is readable reusable and refactor
00:05 - software in JavaScript this is part two
00:08 - of how to write clean functions in
00:10 - JavaScript special thanks to Ryan
00:12 - dermont for a lot of the code on this
00:13 - video check the description for his
00:15 - original article on the topic you should
00:17 - always avoid side effects a function
00:20 - produces a side effect if it does
00:21 - anything other than take a value in and
00:24 - return another value side of X could be
00:26 - many things including writing to a file
00:28 - or modifying some Global variable
00:31 - here's an
00:32 - example so we have let name equals boars
00:35 - function split name into first and last
00:38 - name name equals
00:40 - name.it if we run the function and if we
00:43 - console.log the name we're going to see
00:46 - um the the split name up here but look
00:51 - it's changing the the global variable
00:54 - name to split up so now we cannot access
00:57 - the initial variable anymore so a better
01:00 - way to do it would be like
01:09 - this and now if we run that you can see
01:12 - it's consoling that log boars and then
01:15 - it's consoling log the split barms here
01:18 - because we still have the original name
01:20 - and now we have the new name because
01:22 - this function did not change a global
01:24 - variable it just gave back one one value
01:27 - okay the next thing is that you don't
01:29 - want to write to GL Global functions uh
01:31 - polluting globals is a bad practice in
01:33 - JavaScript because you could class with
01:34 - another Library so an example of this is
01:37 - if you're trying to extend one of
01:40 - javascript's native array methods so for
01:46 - instance it's not really good to add to
01:49 - this Global function AR raise the global
01:51 - function so we we don't want to to just
01:53 - add diff to the array prototype a better
01:57 - way would to just use classes and extend
02:00 - the array
02:02 - Global so I'm going to make this into a
02:11 - class and there we go we just extended
02:15 - the array
02:16 - Global next thing is that you should
02:18 - favor functional programming over
02:20 - imperative
02:21 - programming now JavaScript is not a
02:23 - completely functional programming
02:25 - language like some languages but
02:28 - functional languages are cleaner and
02:29 - easier to test so let me give you an
02:32 - example of just how you can um change
02:33 - something from imperative to functional
02:36 - so this is an imperative programming
02:39 - section so we have this constant where
02:42 - we are going to have the the name and
02:44 - the lines of code for each for each
02:47 - person and then we have let total output
02:50 - equals zero and then we're going to have
02:51 - a for Loop here for let I equals 0 I is
02:54 - less than programmer output. length i++
02:56 - total output plus equals programmer
02:59 - output
03:00 - um index i. Lin of code so it's it's
03:03 - adding up all the the outputs of lines
03:04 - of code so a way we can change this so
03:07 - it's more functional is we're not going
03:10 - to have a for Loop here we're going to
03:12 - we're going to change this to an initial
03:22 - value and we're going to take out this
03:24 - for
03:28 - Loop
03:34 - okay instead of the for Loop we have
03:35 - just this one line con total output
03:38 - equals programmer output we're going to
03:40 - map this to the lines of code and then
03:44 - we're going to reduce all those lines of
03:45 - Code by putting all together the X Plus
03:49 - lines of code we're going to start at
03:50 - zero so using map and reduce helps make
03:54 - your code more
03:56 - functional next thing is encapsulate
03:59 - condition
04:00 - so here's the bad way to do it where
04:02 - we're just going to have this it's going
04:03 - to say if and there's going to be a
04:05 - conditional here so a better way to do
04:08 - this would be to um take this out and
04:13 - I'm going to make this into a function
04:15 - called
04:24 - should so now the conditional is is a
04:29 - function fun so that makes it easier to
04:31 - read next up avoid negative conditionals
04:34 - here's the bad way to do it we're see is
04:37 - Dom node not present node and then we're
04:40 - going to say is not this means not is D
04:45 - node not present so it makes more sense
04:47 - is just to take out the
04:50 - knot and then you don't have a negative
04:54 - conditional the next one sounds pretty
04:56 - crazy at first but it's just avoid
04:58 - conditionals Al together the way you can
05:01 - do things without an if statement or
05:03 - conditional is to use polymorphism to
05:05 - achieve the same thing and the reason
05:08 - why you want to do that is because
05:10 - functions should really only do one
05:11 - thing so if you have an if statement
05:13 - then you're doing a lot of things with
05:14 - your function so for instance if I have
05:17 - this class airplane uh get cruising
05:19 - altitude we're going to have a switch
05:21 - conditional switch if so if the type is
05:23 - 777 we're going to return
05:26 - um this but if it's Air Force One we're
05:29 - going to return this but if it's the
05:31 - Cessna we're going to return this
05:33 - however there is a way we could do that
05:35 - with polymorphism so I'm just going to
05:38 - leave the the old way of doing it and
05:40 - then put this new way right below it so
05:43 - we're going to have the class airplane
05:45 - but then we're going to extend it class
05:47 - Bo 77 extends airplane class um Air
05:50 - Force One extends airplane class Cessna
05:53 - extends airplane and then we have a
05:56 - different get cruising altitude function
05:58 - for each
06:00 - um each class of airplane so instead of
06:02 - using the switch statement we can use
06:06 - polymorphism and then we don't have to
06:08 - have the switch statement so that's just
06:10 - an example of how you can avoid
06:11 - conditionals to make your code more
06:14 - readable and the last one I'm going to
06:16 - talk about is to remove dead code this
06:17 - is pretty straightforward if there's
06:20 - code that you're not using anymore just
06:21 - remove it so just this example um we're
06:24 - only using this new request module we're
06:27 - not using the old request module so we
06:30 - can just take it out you're always going
06:32 - to have um you're always going to have
06:35 - it in your version history if you still
06:36 - need it so there's no reason just to
06:38 - leave it in there just in case thanks
06:41 - for watching my name is Bo KS don't
06:43 - forget to subscribe and remember use
06:45 - your code for good
