00:00 - hello everyone in this video I will be
00:02 - showing you how to make a flappy bird
00:03 - type game in scratch for those of you
00:06 - who don't know what scratches scratch is
00:08 - a block-based programming language where
00:10 - you can drag and drop blocks to create
00:12 - projects it's more of an educational
00:15 - type of visual programming language to
00:17 - teach children how to code
00:18 - there's also a online community where
00:21 - you can view other people's projects and
00:22 - share your own anyways to get started go
00:25 - to scratch.mit.edu which is the scratch
00:28 - website once you're there you can either
00:30 - create a new account by clicking the
00:31 - join scratch button over here or scroll
00:34 - down and download the offline editor
00:36 - which is the same thing if you're using
00:39 - the online version once you have created
00:41 - an account you can click the create
00:43 - button over here to start a new project
00:46 - so let's start by creating the bird so
00:50 - um I'm gonna go to the costumes of the
00:52 - scratch cat
00:53 - and I'm going to delete the second one
00:57 - and I'm going to clear this one and I'll
01:00 - draw my own bird so I'll start by
01:02 - creating a circle
01:05 - let's see about this size I think now
01:09 - I'm going to add a black outline to it
01:13 - right here to maybe a
01:17 - I think size five is good I'll decrease
01:19 - the circle a little bit though
01:21 - maybe to uh
01:24 - this big
01:26 - all right and since I'm making a bird
01:29 - I'll make it yellow on the inside
01:34 - so about this color
01:35 - all right so let's see now I'll draw the
01:38 - eye
01:39 - so
01:40 - um I'm drawing another Circle
01:45 - um I'll make it this big
01:47 - and I'll position this
01:50 - right over here
01:55 - okay
01:57 - I'll actually make this fill black
01:59 - and I'll
02:00 - keep the outline so yeah now I'm going
02:03 - to draw a beak so I'll draw two lines
02:06 - like this
02:09 - okay
02:11 - and I'll make the fill yellow
02:15 - actually the same color as the bird so
02:17 - this
02:19 - and then I gotta make sure the beak is
02:22 - under the bird so I'm going to shift it
02:25 - backwards
02:26 - like that
02:29 - and I think I'm going to add some legs
02:32 - so I'll just draw some quick lines like
02:34 - this
02:39 - and there
02:41 - so yeah this is a really quick uh
02:43 - drawing um I don't want to spend too
02:45 - much time drawing so that's why I
02:47 - quickly created a bird so yeah anyways
02:50 - now I am done and I'm going to go back
02:52 - to the code
02:55 - and now let's start coding the bird
02:58 - so I want the bird to be able to jump
03:00 - when I press the mouse button
03:03 - so to do that let's go to the events
03:06 - and then drag this windfly clicked onto
03:09 - here
03:10 - and now let's go to control and then
03:13 - grab a forever Loop
03:16 - and I'm going to drag and if then
03:19 - statement
03:21 - and then I'm going to go to sensing
03:23 - that's where the mouse down stuff is
03:25 - then I'll drag the mouse down into the
03:27 - if then so pretty much what happens is
03:30 - that when I press the green flag then
03:32 - this keeps checking if the mouse is down
03:35 - so now we want to actually do stuff when
03:38 - the mouse is down so
03:40 - um first of all we want the bird to be
03:42 - affected by gravity so pretty much when
03:45 - the bird falls it falls faster and
03:47 - faster over time so to do that we
03:49 - actually have to create a variable so
03:51 - let's go to variables
03:53 - and let's create one let's call this
03:57 - um
03:58 - uh y
04:00 - velocity
04:03 - and let's select for the Sprite only
04:06 - so pretty much this variable is only or
04:10 - actually a can only be used by the bird
04:12 - so now let's click ok
04:15 - and what our y velocity variable is
04:18 - going to do is that it's going to be the
04:21 - speed of the bird in the Y position
04:23 - which is up and down so pretty much if
04:26 - our y velocity is going to be 3 then the
04:29 - bird is going to move upwards constantly
04:32 - at uh three units and if our y velocity
04:36 - is let's say negative 10 then our bird
04:39 - is going to move downwards constantly by
04:42 - 10 units however we want the bird to
04:45 - move downwards uh faster and faster
04:48 - right we want the bird to fall faster
04:50 - and faster over time so we're going to
04:52 - actually be changing the Y velocity
04:54 - which means that we're going to be
04:56 - changing the speed in which the bird
04:58 - moves down over time so it's like
05:00 - gravity so let's first
05:02 - um set the Y velocity to zero when the
05:05 - flag is clicked
05:07 - and um okay let's make the birds start
05:09 - over here
05:10 - so that's like
05:12 - let's go to motion so
05:14 - negative 172 and 0 in the Y position
05:19 - um and then
05:20 - let's see so
05:22 - what we want is that we want the Y
05:24 - position of the bird to be always
05:27 - changing by the Y velocity variable or
05:31 - the speed so um actually to make this
05:33 - more clear I'm going to rename the Y
05:35 - velocity variable to uh change in y
05:41 - so I think that's easier to understand
05:43 - but anyways let's go back to the motion
05:45 - blocks and what I'm going to do is drag
05:48 - a change Y block
05:50 - drag it inside of the forever Loop
05:53 - and then I'll go to variables and drag
05:56 - the change in y variable inside of the
05:59 - change y by block
06:02 - so what this is is that the Y position
06:04 - of the bird is always going to change by
06:06 - the change in y
06:08 - so now we have to set the values for the
06:11 - change in y so
06:13 - um if we press the mouse button we want
06:16 - to set the change in y by let's say
06:21 - um nine
06:22 - so pretty much what happens is that when
06:25 - we click
06:26 - then the speed of the bird will be going
06:29 - upwards by nine and it would keep going
06:32 - up so let's try it out
06:34 - when we press then it keeps going up
06:37 - like that
06:38 - so yeah but now of course we want the
06:41 - bird to fall so what we can do is
06:43 - actually just drag a change change in y
06:47 - by block and put it in the forever Loop
06:51 - and let's change it by let's say
06:53 - negative zero point eight
06:56 - sorry negative 0.8
07:00 - so since there is gravity we always want
07:02 - the bird to be going downwards
07:04 - so now let's try it out
07:07 - now as you can see it works
07:11 - um there's gravity because uh the bird
07:13 - keeps going down by negative 0.8
07:16 - and then when we press the mouse button
07:18 - then the speed of the bird changes to
07:22 - nine
07:24 - so um yeah that's a really simple um
07:26 - jumping script we have right here
07:29 - and anyways that'll do it for right now
07:31 - uh for the bird
07:32 - so now let's create our pipes where the
07:36 - bird's gonna go through so let's click
07:38 - the button over here and let's create a
07:40 - new Sprite
07:42 - so um I'm just going to draw some simple
07:45 - pipes uh let's see I'm going to draw a
07:49 - rectangle
07:51 - like this
07:54 - and I'm going to make the pipes green
07:59 - and all right
08:02 - now I'm going to add another rectangle
08:04 - put it right here
08:08 - like this
08:11 - okay I'll make the pipes a bit thicker
08:18 - all right
08:22 - okay
08:26 - cool all right so this is going to be
08:28 - the top pipe and now we want the bottom
08:31 - pipe so let's create a new costume
08:36 - actually um let's duplicate this one and
08:39 - then I'm just gonna flip it so let's
08:41 - select the entire thing and then let's
08:44 - uh flip uh vertically
08:47 - and now we have the bottom pipe all
08:49 - right so we have the top and the bottom
08:51 - pipe so let's first name these I'll name
08:54 - this top pipe
08:57 - and this one bottom pipe
09:00 - and all right let's go back to the code
09:03 - so of course we want a winify clicked
09:08 - and um what we want is that we want this
09:12 - Sprite to be creating copies of the top
09:15 - and bottom pipe because we're going to
09:16 - have more than one pipe on the screen at
09:19 - any given time so just to make it easier
09:21 - to manage we don't want the actual
09:24 - Sprite to show so let's go to looks and
09:27 - then hide the Sprite
09:29 - when the flag is clicked
09:31 - and now
09:32 - um we we want the Sprite to keep
09:34 - creating clones so let's go to control
09:36 - and then drag a forever Loop
09:39 - and let's uh go to events
09:44 - um oh sorry not events of control and
09:47 - let's drag a create clone of myself
09:49 - and put it inside of the forever Loop so
09:52 - I'm just going to keep creating clones
09:53 - of the pipe and um we actually wanted to
09:56 - create two clones of the pipe because we
09:58 - have a top and the bottom pipe
10:02 - so if we try it right now then it's only
10:04 - going to create the Clones of the bottom
10:06 - pipe oh of course the pipes aren't shown
10:09 - but um anyways if we do show the pipes
10:11 - let's just drag it when they start as a
10:13 - clone and also a show
10:17 - then the pipes are there's like tons of
10:20 - clones of the pipes like that
10:22 - but we want the Sprite to simultaneously
10:25 - create the top and bottom pipes
10:27 - so uh let's actually first create a
10:30 - variable
10:32 - and let's name this
10:36 - um
10:37 - bottom
10:39 - or top
10:40 - pipe I guess
10:42 - and make sure to select for the swipe
10:44 - only this is very important otherwise it
10:46 - won't work so select for the Sprite only
10:49 - and then click ok
10:52 - and now uh what we want to do is to set
10:55 - bottom or top pipe and then drag it to
10:58 - the further Loop right before it creates
11:00 - a clone of itself
11:02 - and let's set it to top
11:05 - and then let's uh duplicate this
11:09 - and then put it under here
11:11 - and then we want to set bottom or top
11:14 - pipe to bottom
11:17 - and then it creates clone of itself
11:18 - again
11:19 - so I'll explain to you later what this
11:21 - does but pretty much the Clone is going
11:24 - to use this variable to know whether it
11:26 - is the top or the bottom pipe
11:28 - so anyways
11:30 - um let's add a weight in here so let's
11:33 - go to events actually a control
11:36 - and then let's drag a way to one second
11:38 - and I'll change this to maybe three
11:40 - seconds all right and now in the when I
11:44 - start as a clone we want to show it
11:46 - and now we want to add a if else
11:49 - statement so let's drag that
11:52 - and we want to check if it's the top
11:54 - pipe then it switches its costume to the
11:58 - top pipe costume and if it's the bottom
12:00 - pipe then it's going to switch costume
12:02 - to the bottom pipe costume so that's why
12:05 - we use this variable
12:06 - so um let's do that so let's go to
12:09 - operators
12:10 - grab an equals operator drag inside of
12:13 - here
12:14 - and let's go to variables grab the
12:16 - bottom or top pipe variable put inside
12:18 - here
12:20 - and if the bottom or top pipe variable
12:22 - is equal to bottom make sure it's uh
12:26 - spelled the same as how you spelled it
12:28 - here
12:29 - but if it's bottom then we want it to
12:32 - switch costume
12:34 - to bottom pipe
12:36 - and else if it is top then we switch
12:39 - costume to top pipe
12:42 - so it's as simple as that
12:44 - now let's try this out it's not going to
12:47 - work but let's just see how it is so far
12:50 - so as you can see this actually spawns
12:52 - the top and bottom pipe like that
12:55 - all right so now we want the top and
12:58 - bottom pipes to actually be positioned
13:01 - correctly we want the top pipe right
13:04 - here and bottom pipe right here
13:07 - so to do that
13:08 - uh for now let's just go to motion and
13:11 - grab a go to put it after the switch
13:14 - costume to bottom pipe
13:16 - and for the bottom pipe Let's uh
13:20 - let's see
13:22 - let's make it go like right here for now
13:28 - so we want to spawn at the edge of the
13:31 - screen right because the pipes are going
13:32 - to move from the right to the left so
13:35 - exposition
13:37 - 259
13:39 - and Y position negative two one two
13:42 - all right and for the top pipe
13:47 - um let's see
13:49 - let's make it spawn
13:52 - let's say right here so 259 and Y
13:55 - position 54.
13:58 - all right so let's try that for now
14:01 - so as you can see the top and bottom
14:03 - pipes spawn like this
14:05 - and now we want the top and bottom pipes
14:07 - to move to the left side of the screen
14:09 - right so to do this is to um go to
14:12 - control
14:13 - and grab a repeat until block let's put
14:16 - that after the if else statement
14:18 - so what the repeat until block does is
14:20 - that it keeps doing something as long as
14:23 - the thing in here is true and then after
14:27 - the thing in here is false then it runs
14:29 - the code after so of course since we
14:33 - want the blocks to disappear after
14:36 - reaching the left side of the screen
14:38 - uh we want to grab a operator let's grab
14:42 - a lesser than operator put inside here
14:45 - and let's go to motion grab the
14:48 - X position uh block right here drag it
14:51 - inside of the repeat until operator
14:54 - and we want to check if the X position
14:56 - is less than a certain number then the
15:00 - Clones delete itself
15:01 - so let's see let's first show the
15:03 - initial Sprite and let's see
15:07 - right here so if the X position is less
15:10 - than negative 237 then the Clones should
15:14 - delete themselves so let's go to a
15:16 - control
15:17 - and let's grab a delete this clone and
15:20 - drag it after the repeat until
15:23 - so of course we want the pipes to be
15:25 - moving to the left until the X position
15:28 - is less than negative 237. so let's go
15:30 - to motion and let's grab a change X by
15:35 - block and put it inside of the repeat
15:37 - until
15:39 - and let's change it by let's say
15:41 - negative five
15:43 - so we want the pipes to move towards the
15:47 - left by five units until it reaches the
15:50 - edge here and then it hides
15:52 - so yeah let's try it out
15:55 - and as you can see the pipes work like
15:58 - that
15:59 - and we can like increase or decrease the
16:01 - spawn rate
16:02 - so maybe you can wait like one second
16:04 - and we can see
16:07 - there's the pipes like this
16:09 - and they also disappear
16:11 - um once they touch the left edge of the
16:13 - screen and they appear from the right
16:16 - so yeah the pipes seem to be working
16:18 - however we want spawning in the Y
16:21 - position
16:22 - so to do that we actually have to create
16:24 - a new variable so let's create a new
16:27 - variable
16:28 - let's call it
16:31 - random
16:33 - uh
16:35 - y spawn I guess
16:38 - random y spawn position
16:42 - and
16:43 - let's select uh for this file only
16:47 - and then click ok
16:48 - so um what we want to do is to set a
16:52 - random y position for the blocks to
16:55 - spawn from so to do that let's first
16:58 - drag this um into this forever Loop
17:01 - before it creates clones of the pipes
17:04 - and let's go to operators to grab the
17:08 - pick random and put it inside of the set
17:11 - random y spawn position
17:13 - and
17:15 - um let's see let's maybe okay let's deal
17:18 - with this later but let's see the range
17:21 - in which the pipes can spawn so I'm
17:24 - going to show the original Sprite
17:27 - and I'm going to do some testing
17:29 - so let's see
17:32 - um I think the top pipe should be right
17:33 - here around
17:35 - this would be the highest point it can
17:38 - spawn
17:39 - so that's why position 153
17:42 - and
17:44 - the lowest position for the bottom pipe
17:47 - is going to be let's say right here so
17:50 - negative 284.
17:53 - so for now let's just put in uh one what
17:56 - was it again 153 I think
18:00 - yeah 153 to negative 284 I think
18:07 - let's just double check
18:12 - yeah something like that all right so
18:14 - this is going to be the range in which
18:16 - the pipes can spawn
18:17 - but oh yeah one important thing I think
18:20 - to make this easier let's go do the
18:22 - costumes
18:23 - and make sure that the pipes are
18:25 - actually positioned where we want them
18:27 - so
18:29 - let's say uh let's copy this bottom pipe
18:32 - and put it into the top pipe for now
18:36 - and let's say we want our space to be
18:39 - this big right
18:41 - then we want to make sure that the top
18:44 - pipe and bottom pipe are positioned like
18:47 - this in each of their costumes so I'm
18:49 - going to move this to the middle
18:51 - right here
18:54 - okay I think this is the middle
18:57 - all right
18:58 - so right here
18:59 - so now I'm going to delete the bottom
19:01 - pipe
19:04 - or actually not yet I'm going to first
19:07 - duplicate this
19:08 - and then I'm going to delete the bottom
19:10 - pipe
19:12 - and now I'm gonna go to my duplicate
19:16 - and then I'm going to delete the top
19:17 - pipe
19:19 - and now we don't need this extra bottom
19:22 - pipe costume so yeah
19:25 - anyways now we have the top pipe and
19:28 - bottom pipe uh where we want them
19:31 - and I'm going to first rename this to
19:33 - bottom pipe
19:34 - all right cool
19:36 - so of course you can change the space in
19:39 - which is between the top and bottom pipe
19:41 - so that's up to you but yeah let's go
19:44 - back to the code now
19:46 - and let's see let's find our range in y
19:50 - positions again now so
19:54 - um let's see for the top pipe I'd say
19:57 - y position 79
20:00 - and for the bottom pipe I'd say y
20:03 - position
20:04 - negative 79. all right that works well
20:09 - so now because I repositioned these two
20:12 - pipes to where I want them it's now
20:15 - super easy so all you have to do is to
20:18 - go to variables and then drag the random
20:21 - y spawn position into the go to
20:24 - x y and in the Y so let's drag that into
20:27 - here for both the top and the bottom
20:30 - pipe
20:31 - and now let's try it out
20:34 - so
20:36 - as you can see it works however the
20:39 - pipes are
20:40 - um entirely on the screen like there's
20:44 - some empty space
20:45 - but of course we can go to the costumes
20:47 - and change that but at least the random
20:50 - y position works
20:52 - so as you can see they're spawned
20:54 - randomly
20:55 - so to change or actually to fix the
20:58 - problem let's go to costumes
21:01 - and all we need to do is to increase
21:05 - this length of the rectangle so let's
21:08 - drag this entire rectangle
21:09 - down here
21:12 - and I'm going to
21:14 - drag this rectangle upwards like this
21:18 - all right now I'm going to select the
21:20 - entire thing
21:21 - and then drag it back up
21:24 - I think it was right around here
21:28 - uh
21:29 - okay maybe a bit more downwards
21:34 - yeah about right all right and now let's
21:36 - do the same for the bottom pipe
21:38 - move it up here
21:40 - drag the rectangle down here
21:43 - and then drag the entire thing back down
21:46 - so right around here I think
21:50 - so yeah all right looks good
21:53 - um okay I think this one's positioned a
21:55 - bit to the left so I'll move it back
22:01 - maybe this one a bit to the left
22:06 - all right cool
22:08 - so now let's run it
22:10 - and as you can see the pipes now spawn
22:13 - like this they're in a random y position
22:15 - and the entire pipe uh covers like
22:19 - both the top and the bottom edges of the
22:22 - screen so awesome
22:25 - um I think I'm going to increase the Gap
22:27 - a bit because I don't think the bird can
22:29 - go through like very easily
22:32 - or uh if it's possible at all so
22:36 - let's increase the Gap and to do that
22:38 - it's really simple you just move the top
22:40 - and the bottom pipe upwards and
22:42 - downwards so the top pipe upwards like
22:45 - this
22:46 - and the bottom pipe downwards like this
22:50 - all right and make sure your Gap is
22:53 - equal on both the top and the bottom
22:55 - compared to the middle like over here
22:57 - versus over here
22:59 - so yeah it looks about right now let's
23:01 - try it
23:02 - and now the Gap is much larger so
23:05 - awesome
23:08 - um I'll make the bird a bit smaller I
23:09 - think so I'll go back to the bird
23:12 - I'm gonna go to looks and change the
23:15 - size or set the size to maybe 80.
23:19 - okay I think that's better
23:21 - so yeah
23:23 - now I think for the bird
23:25 - it looks a bit like too still when it
23:29 - jumps so I think I'm going to rotate it
23:31 - when it jumps so it looks like it's
23:33 - actually flapping
23:35 - so to do that let's um just go to motion
23:38 - and drag a point in Direction and drag
23:41 - it under the if Mouse down
23:44 - and I'm going to change it to
23:47 - um let's say 45 degrees
23:50 - and what this does is that it's going to
23:52 - change it to like this when it drops but
23:55 - of course we want the bird to rotate
23:57 - back to its original position which was
24:00 - 90 degrees
24:01 - so let's just grab an if statement
24:06 - and then put it inside of the forever
24:08 - Loop
24:09 - and let's go to operators grab a lesser
24:12 - than operator
24:14 - and we want to check if the direction
24:17 - which is in the motions
24:19 - is less than 90
24:22 - which was its starting Direction then we
24:25 - want it to turn uh clockwise
24:28 - let's say three degrees
24:32 - so pretty much if the bird is like this
24:35 - then it's Gonna Keep rotating until it
24:37 - faces the right so let's try it out
24:40 - now as you can see there is some motion
24:42 - with the bird
24:43 - so when it flaps it sort of moves back
24:46 - like that
24:48 - so I think it looks better like this
24:50 - and I might change it to maybe turn four
24:52 - degrees
24:54 - so let's try it all right
24:57 - I think that looks much better
25:00 - so yeah
25:01 - um now
25:02 - let's make a simple lose state so when
25:06 - the bird touches the pipes then let's
25:08 - just stop the game for right now so uh
25:11 - let's see
25:12 - let's drag a if statement inside of the
25:16 - forever Loop
25:18 - and let's go to sensing
25:20 - and it's detect
25:22 - if touching Sprite 2 or the pipes
25:26 - then it's going to stop all so let's go
25:29 - to control
25:30 - and let's stop everything
25:33 - so let's try it out
25:37 - and yeah when it touched a pipe then the
25:40 - entire game stopped all right
25:42 - so okay I'm going to first hide all of
25:44 - my variables
25:46 - all right
25:48 - so now let's try it again
25:52 - okay and when it touched the pipe then
25:55 - the entire game stopped all right cool
26:00 - okay
26:02 - and it's like this
26:05 - okay
26:06 - um I think I'm going to add a simple
26:08 - background so I'll go to backdrops here
26:10 - go to costumes or backdrops and then I'm
26:13 - going to
26:15 - fill it
26:16 - or actually I'll convert to bitmap
26:18 - and then I'll fill this maybe to a light
26:21 - blue
26:24 - let's see
26:29 - like this
26:30 - and all right
26:32 - now we have some simple backdrop
26:35 - so um yeah this is our completed game
26:39 - we're actually not completed but a
26:41 - completed working game
26:43 - so all right cool
26:45 - let's see
26:46 - yeah this is a bit hard right now but
26:48 - you know you can tweak it
26:50 - to change the difficulty to make it
26:53 - easier maybe so yeah
27:01 - this is part two on how to make a Flappy
27:03 - Bird game in scratch in this tutorial I
27:06 - will be creating an infinite scrolling
27:08 - background and a scoring system so the
27:11 - first thing I wanted to add that I
27:13 - didn't do in the last video was to make
27:15 - the bird
27:16 - uh be able to lose when it reaches the
27:18 - bottom of the screen over here
27:21 - so to do that it's actually really
27:23 - simple let's go to operators
27:24 - and then grab an or statement
27:28 - and let's put it over here
27:30 - so
27:31 - if the bird is touching Sprite two which
27:34 - are the pipes or if the bird's y
27:36 - position
27:37 - is less than a certain value
27:42 - um let's see if it's less than
27:45 - negative 171
27:49 - then we want to stop the game
27:52 - so let's try it out if the bird goes to
27:54 - the bottom here then the Game Stops all
27:57 - right so now that we're done with that
27:59 - I'm going to start creating the
28:01 - scrolling background so I was thinking
28:03 - of maybe adding some hills in the
28:06 - background and then making them moving
28:08 - slowly to the left to make it look like
28:10 - the bird is you know moving
28:12 - so let's do that so let's first create a
28:15 - new Sprite
28:17 - and now I'm going to draw my Hills
28:25 - all right so I'm done with my hill and
28:28 - what I did was that I just made a
28:30 - rectangle across the entire drawing area
28:32 - and then I used this v-shape tool to you
28:36 - know add a few points and then I just
28:38 - moved these points around to make it
28:41 - curvy
28:42 - all right so make sure that the width of
28:46 - your Hill is exactly the same width as
28:48 - the drawing area no more no less as you
28:52 - can see I made this very exact
28:55 - so yeah and also make sure that the
28:58 - height of the left Edge over here is the
29:01 - exact same height as the height of the
29:03 - right Edge over here anyways uh this
29:06 - will do for now and let me go back to
29:09 - the code
29:11 - uh so first off I'm going to grab a one
29:14 - fly clicked in the events
29:16 - and then I'm going to make the hills go
29:19 - to zero zero
29:22 - so now it's in the center of the screen
29:23 - and what I want is that I want this hill
29:26 - to constantly move towards the left so
29:29 - to do that let's go to control grab a
29:32 - forever Loop
29:34 - and then let's go to motion
29:36 - grab the change X by block put it inside
29:39 - of the further Loop
29:41 - and let's say let's change X by negative
29:45 - three
29:47 - all right so if we try right now
29:49 - then the hill as you can see always
29:51 - moves towards the left by three units
29:54 - all right so um since I'm going to be
29:57 - testing this hill a lot I'm going to
29:59 - disconnect the code from the chicken and
30:02 - and the pipes
30:06 - so you know it's only the hill and I'm
30:08 - also going to hide the chicken
30:10 - all right
30:12 - so now this is just a hill
30:15 - so yeah all right cool
30:17 - so now that the hill moves now we want
30:20 - the hill to go from the left edge of the
30:22 - screen to the right edge of the screen
30:24 - once it reaches the end over here so to
30:28 - do that let's grab an if statement
30:31 - and let's put this inside of the forever
30:33 - Loop
30:35 - and we want to check if the X position
30:37 - of the hills are less than a certain
30:40 - value
30:41 - so let's go to operators
30:43 - grab a less than operator go to motion
30:45 - grab an X position
30:48 - and let's check if the X position is
30:50 - less than
30:52 - um negative
30:56 - 464. so what I did was that I found the
30:59 - smallest possible value for this right
31:01 - which is a negative 465 and then I just
31:05 - added one so yeah so once the X position
31:08 - of the hills is less than negative 464
31:12 - then we want it to move to the right
31:14 - side of the screen
31:16 - so since I made this hill the exact
31:19 - width of the screen which is 480 pixels
31:23 - or units then what I can do is just
31:26 - simply uh set X to its current X
31:30 - position over here multiplied by
31:32 - negative one
31:34 - so let's go to operators grab the
31:36 - negative one operator
31:38 - drag it inside of the set X2
31:40 - and then go to motion grab the X
31:42 - position
31:43 - and type in negative one
31:46 - all right so let's try it out
31:48 - once the hill reaches the left side of
31:51 - the screen
31:52 - then it teleports to the right side
31:55 - all right so it works
31:57 - it's infinite like this
32:01 - let's see it again
32:03 - and all right it works
32:05 - so uh oh yeah one thing I noticed was
32:07 - that it's not very smooth
32:09 - as you can see here
32:12 - you can see that it sort of gets cut off
32:14 - early before it teleports to the right
32:17 - side so I don't really want that to
32:19 - happen let's say it again as you can see
32:22 - it doesn't completely go off the screen
32:25 - so that's sort of something that scratch
32:28 - has and to actually fix the issue I'm
32:31 - just going to go to looks and grab a set
32:34 - size to block and right before it
32:38 - changes X by negative three and checks
32:41 - if the X position is less than negative
32:43 - 464. I'm going to set size to 150
32:48 - percent
32:50 - and right after the hill moves and
32:53 - checks for all the stuff then I'm going
32:56 - to set the size back to 100 percent
32:59 - so like this before all of your code put
33:01 - in set size to 1 to 50 and then right
33:04 - after put set size to 100 percent
33:08 - so this is sort of complicated to
33:10 - explain but pretty much what this does
33:12 - is that
33:14 - um the set size makes the hills bigger
33:17 - then it's actually supposed to be which
33:19 - is 100 percent
33:20 - so right before it moves it can
33:23 - technically go off screen
33:25 - but then right after it moves it changes
33:28 - back to its original size
33:30 - so you wouldn't even notice that it's
33:33 - 150 of its normal size
33:36 - so let's try it out
33:38 - and let's see
33:42 - now oh oops okay I forgot to change this
33:45 - to if the X position is less than
33:48 - negative 480 or actually a negative 479
33:52 - so since the left edge of the screen is
33:56 - negative 240 and the entire size of this
33:59 - costume is 480 then half of the costume
34:02 - size is going to be 240 and then once
34:06 - you subtract
34:07 - 240 from negative 240 then that is the
34:11 - rightmost edge
34:13 - of the Sprite at the leftmost edge
34:16 - so yeah um that was again sort of
34:18 - confusing uh sorry but it should make
34:20 - sense visually so now let's try it out
34:22 - again
34:26 - and
34:28 - as you can see now the hill smoothly
34:31 - goes from the left side to the right
34:33 - side
34:34 - so let's see it again
34:37 - and all right so it works cool and I'm
34:41 - actually going to quickly add a uh dark
34:43 - green outline
34:45 - because I think the light green uh is
34:47 - sort of too close to the light blue
34:50 - color of the sky so yeah I'm just going
34:52 - to quickly add a line over here
34:58 - all right so I'm done with my outline I
35:01 - just pretty much added a line and then I
35:04 - just reshaped it using this tool to fit
35:06 - the hill
35:07 - all right so now I think it looks better
35:10 - let's try it again
35:12 - and as you can see there's the hill
35:15 - and then teleports back
35:17 - so now we need to add the second Hill
35:19 - because once the hill is moving then
35:22 - there's a lot of empty space and we
35:24 - don't want that
35:26 - so to add a second Hill all we need to
35:28 - do is to go to control and then create
35:31 - clone of myself
35:33 - all right
35:34 - and
35:36 - um we want to make the Clone do the
35:38 - exact same thing as the original Sprite
35:41 - however the only difference will be that
35:43 - the Clone is shifted to the right of the
35:46 - Sprite so let's grab a1sr as a clone
35:50 - then let's go to motion and then let's
35:53 - drag this go to x480 and then y0 and
35:57 - make sure to go to looks grab the set
36:00 - size to 150 put it before the go to XY
36:03 - and then grab the set size 100 and then
36:05 - put it after
36:07 - since uh we want the Clone to go
36:09 - completely off screen so yeah
36:12 - anyway since the Clone is going to have
36:14 - exactly the same code as the original
36:16 - Sprite we're going to create a block so
36:19 - let's go to my blocks and then make a
36:21 - block let's call this uh
36:24 - move
36:25 - then let's click ok
36:28 - all right now we have move and now we
36:31 - want to drag this
36:33 - um set size to 150 and stuff like that
36:37 - into the move and now we can drag our
36:40 - move block inside of the forever Loop
36:43 - and okay so my move block did not appear
36:47 - um that sometimes happens so I'm just
36:49 - going to refresh the page
36:51 - there we go so now there is the move
36:54 - block
36:55 - and let's put this inside of the fur
36:57 - Loop
36:59 - and for the Clone let's just duplicate
37:01 - this forever Loop and then put it under
37:03 - the stuff over here
37:05 - all right so now the original Sprite and
37:08 - the Clone both follow the same uh code
37:10 - in the move block so it's sort of
37:12 - simpler because if I want to change
37:14 - something all I need to do is change
37:16 - this one move block instead of you know
37:19 - changing to separate uh blocks like this
37:22 - so all right
37:24 - now let's see how it looks so as you can
37:27 - see there is now a infinite scrolling
37:30 - Hill background
37:31 - and it looks very smooth and uh yeah
37:36 - all right so I think there's a tiny
37:39 - um difference in the line I just drew so
37:43 - I'm just going to fix it real quick
37:45 - let's see
37:46 - it's over here
37:49 - [Music]
37:52 - okay let's try it again
37:55 - uh yeah you can barely tell that I have
37:58 - two Hills
38:00 - so yeah
38:02 - all right so now that we're done with
38:04 - the hill background we can add the
38:05 - chicken and the pipes back
38:07 - so let's
38:09 - um show the chicken
38:11 - then reconnect the blocks
38:13 - then go to the pipes
38:15 - reconnect the blocks also
38:18 - and now we can try it out and okay the
38:22 - hills are in front of both the chicken
38:24 - and the pipes so we want them to go back
38:27 - so let's go to looks and grab a um
38:31 - go backwards
38:34 - let's say 10 layers to make sure that it
38:37 - actually goes back
38:39 - and now let's drag this
38:41 - um in the when flag clicked before it
38:43 - creates a clone of itself
38:45 - and now it works like this
38:48 - all right cool
38:49 - now we have sort of some Parallax going
38:52 - on which is pretty much um the hill
38:54 - moves to the left slower than the pipes
38:57 - do
38:58 - so uh yeah
39:01 - um
39:03 - now we have our infinite background and
39:06 - now we're going to make a simple scoring
39:08 - system
39:09 - so let's go to the pipes
39:12 - and let's see
39:14 - we want to First create a score variable
39:17 - so let's go to variables
39:19 - then create a variable let's call this
39:22 - score then for all Sprites and then
39:24 - click ok
39:26 - all right so what we want to do is that
39:29 - if the bird goes past the middle of the
39:33 - pipes then we want the score to increase
39:35 - by one
39:37 - so um to do that we have to go into
39:40 - pipes and then we want to check
39:43 - if the X position of the bird is greater
39:47 - than the X position of the pipes
39:50 - so let's go to operators
39:52 - and grab a greater than operator
39:55 - and let's go to sensing
39:58 - grab the backdrop number of stage block
40:02 - and change the stage to Sprite one
40:05 - which is the bird
40:07 - and now we have our X position of Sprite
40:10 - 1. so if the X position of the bird is
40:14 - greater than
40:15 - the pipe X position so motion and then X
40:19 - position
40:20 - then we want to go to variables and then
40:23 - change score by one
40:26 - all right now we want to put this inside
40:28 - of the repeat until
40:31 - and now as the pipes are moving to the
40:33 - left it's going to constantly check
40:37 - so now there's uh one problem though
40:40 - whenever the bird is past the pipes the
40:43 - score goes up by a lot because it keeps
40:46 - checking and the score keeps going up
40:47 - but we only want the score to go up once
40:51 - so um to fix that we can just simply
40:54 - create a variable
40:56 - let's name this already scored
40:59 - so already
41:03 - scored
41:04 - and we want to select for the Sprite
41:06 - only
41:07 - this is very important for the Spy only
41:10 - then let's click ok
41:12 - and
41:14 - let's see where is my variable
41:17 - hmm
41:20 - all right so there it is already scored
41:22 - so
41:24 - um what we're going to do is to first
41:26 - set already scored to no
41:29 - because uh when the pipes spawn then the
41:32 - bird hasn't gone through them yet so of
41:35 - course the bird has not scored so let's
41:37 - set this to no put it um before
41:40 - everything in the uh if and repeat until
41:43 - loops
41:45 - and now we want to check if the bird has
41:47 - not yet already scored then we want to
41:50 - change score by one
41:52 - so let's go to operators grab an and
41:55 - and let's grab an equal
41:57 - and let's go to variables grab already
42:00 - scored
42:01 - and let's check if already scored is
42:04 - equals to no
42:06 - now let's drag this over here into the
42:09 - left side
42:10 - and let's put it back
42:12 - so of course it also checks
42:15 - if the bird has already scored and if
42:18 - it's no then it changes score by one
42:21 - but of course once it changes the score
42:23 - by one then it has scored so we don't
42:26 - want this to call again
42:28 - so we just set already scored
42:31 - to yes
42:34 - so now it's only going to call once so
42:37 - let's try it out
42:41 - all right
42:42 - and it doesn't quite work
42:46 - um the score goes up by two
42:48 - so let's see I think to fix this I'm
42:51 - going to make this
42:53 - um set before the score changes by one
42:55 - now let's try it again
42:59 - okay still does not work
43:02 - um let's see
43:04 - um
43:07 - oh yeah that is because we have both the
43:10 - top and the bottom pipe so it acts as
43:13 - two clones and they both check so what
43:16 - we want to do is either only make the
43:18 - top or the bottom pipe check
43:20 - so let's only make the top pipe check
43:23 - so to do that let's grab another
43:25 - operator grab an and
43:27 - grab an equals and let's see check if
43:32 - the bottom or top pipe is equal to top
43:37 - now let's drag this into the left side
43:40 - and I'll check the entire thing back in
43:45 - let me zoom out a bit
43:47 - all right
43:49 - and now it should work so first it
43:52 - checks if the X position of the bird is
43:55 - greater than the current pipe exposition
43:58 - which means that the bird went past it
44:00 - also checks if the bird already scored
44:04 - and also checks if the bottom or top
44:07 - pipe is equal to top
44:08 - then if all of these are true
44:11 - then it sets already scored to yes and
44:14 - then it changes score by one now let's
44:16 - try it out
44:18 - um first of all I'm going to set the
44:21 - score to zero whenever the five is
44:23 - clicked
44:24 - and now we should be good
44:26 - so
44:28 - as you can see the score changes by one
44:30 - every time
44:33 - so yeah all right it works cool
44:37 - let me try it again
44:42 - and yeah
44:45 - um now I have both my scrolling
44:47 - background and the score counter the
44:50 - game also ends when the bird touches the
44:52 - bottom of the screen like this
44:58 - this is part three on how to make a
45:00 - Flappy Bird game in scratch in this
45:02 - video I will be making the pipes go on
45:04 - screen and off screen more smoothly add
45:06 - a number counter for the score and add a
45:09 - simple blue screen anyways let's get
45:12 - started with the pipes so if you see the
45:14 - pipes right now they sort of suddenly
45:16 - appear at the edge of the screen and
45:19 - they don't really smoothly appear and
45:21 - they also disappear before they can
45:24 - completely go off screen like that
45:26 - so I'm going to fix that so let's first
45:29 - go to the pipes and then let's do the
45:32 - same thing we did for the background so
45:34 - in the last video I made the background
45:36 - be able to go on screen and off screen
45:38 - smoothly by first setting its size to a
45:41 - larger size than the actual size we want
45:43 - and then we uh position the background
45:47 - to where we want it and then we set the
45:49 - size back to its original size
45:51 - so let's do the same thing for the pipes
45:53 - so let's go to the pipes
45:55 - and then um right before it spawns Let's
45:59 - uh go to looks and then grab a set size
46:03 - two
46:04 - and let's change this to like 150
46:06 - percent
46:07 - and then drag it right before go to x y
46:11 - and then let's drag a set size to 100
46:14 - right after the go to XY
46:18 - and now let's change the uh X to like
46:21 - maybe 270 to completely make sure that
46:24 - the pipe is starting off screen
46:27 - and um for the top pipe let's do the
46:29 - same thing so set size to 150 put it
46:34 - before and then set size to 100 put it
46:37 - after
46:38 - so let's try it out
46:41 - and they still don't entirely start off
46:46 - screen so
46:48 - um okay I think it should work after we
46:51 - also set size to 150 percent and 100
46:56 - um before and after it changes X by
46:58 - negative five
46:59 - so let's try it out so let's drag this
47:02 - before we change X by negative five and
47:04 - then drag this after the change X by
47:06 - negative five so now let's try it again
47:10 - and
47:11 - yeah I think that works
47:13 - um the pipes as you can see
47:14 - um Spawn from the right side of the
47:16 - screen uh smoothly
47:18 - they don't you know sort of randomly
47:19 - appear from The Edge so yeah
47:22 - and now let's uh fix the
47:26 - um pipes leaving the screen
47:28 - so right now it's still a bit choppy
47:30 - when they leave the screen like that
47:32 - let's see it again
47:34 - yep so still a bit choppy
47:37 - so to fix that
47:39 - all we need to do is to change this x
47:41 - position to a smaller number
47:44 - so maybe let's say if x position is less
47:47 - than 200 and I mean negative 260.
47:52 - now let's try it out
47:54 - oops okay
47:56 - let's try it again
47:58 - let me first reattach this
48:01 - and all right
48:02 - so let's see
48:05 - and cool they also leave the screen
48:07 - smoothly
48:09 - so yeah I think we uh fixed the pipes
48:13 - and all right now that we have the pipes
48:17 - fixed
48:18 - um now I'm going to make a number
48:19 - counter for the score so instead of
48:22 - using this variable I'm going to use
48:24 - actual numbers and that just makes the
48:26 - game look a bit better so yeah let's
48:29 - first create a new Sprite
48:31 - and just paint 10 costumes with the
48:34 - numbers zero through nine so yeah
48:37 - [Music]
48:41 - and yeah so now I have the numbers one
48:44 - two three four five six seven eight nine
48:46 - and then zero so the uh costume names
48:49 - don't matter but the order matters so
48:51 - make sure it's one through nine and then
48:53 - zero at the end so all right now let's
48:55 - go back to the code
48:57 - and let's first grab a win flag clicked
49:00 - then let's hide the original Sprite
49:02 - because we're going to be using clones
49:04 - for this
49:06 - and then let's create a variable
49:09 - uh let's name this I guess uh digits
49:13 - and then select for the Sprite only
49:15 - remember this is very important for the
49:17 - Sprite only because each clone is going
49:20 - to have a different value for the
49:21 - variable so if we do for all Sprites
49:24 - then it's not going to work because
49:26 - whenever the variable changes in value
49:29 - then all of the Clones are going to have
49:31 - the same value for that variable so we
49:34 - want the Clones to have separate values
49:36 - for the digits variable so select for
49:39 - this file only and then click ok
49:42 - all right
49:44 - by the way if your variable doesn't show
49:46 - up immediately after you created it then
49:48 - you can just refresh the page and it
49:50 - should show up
49:51 - but anyways
49:53 - um let's grab a set digits to block
49:55 - and let's set the digits to one
49:59 - and let's drag this after the hide
50:02 - now uh let's go to control
50:05 - grab a repeat Loop
50:07 - and then let's grab a create clone of
50:10 - myself
50:11 - and then go to variables and let's grab
50:14 - a change digits by one and this just
50:17 - creates 10 clones each with a different
50:20 - value of the digits so anyways now we
50:23 - want the Clones to do stuff right so
50:25 - let's go to events actually a control
50:27 - sorry
50:28 - and then let's drag a 1sr as a clone
50:33 - then we want the Clone to show
50:39 - um or actually uh not show yet but yeah
50:42 - so let's go to control grab a forever
50:45 - Loop
50:47 - put it under the when it starts to clone
50:49 - and then we want the Clones to go to a
50:53 - specific position based on its digits
50:55 - variable so let's go to motion
50:59 - and then drag a go to Y position sorry a
51:02 - go to XY position and then let's go to
51:06 - variables grab the digits variable
51:08 - and then go to operators grab the
51:11 - multiplication operator let's drag the
51:13 - digits variable inside of the left side
51:15 - of the operator
51:17 - and let's say uh
51:20 - let's multiply this by 10.
51:24 - now let's drag this inside of the X
51:28 - position of the go to XY
51:30 - and let's place this inside of the
51:33 - forever Loop
51:34 - so if I just run this
51:36 - what this does is that oops okay I need
51:39 - to show the clones for now so yep
51:43 - all right so if I run this then what
51:45 - this does is that it creates 10 clones
51:48 - and they are all spaced apart by 10
51:51 - pixels and this is because each clone
51:53 - has a different digits value because
51:56 - when I first set digits to one and then
51:58 - created a clone the Clone I created the
52:01 - first time had the digits value set to
52:03 - one but then since I changed digits by
52:06 - one the next clone I created has the
52:09 - value of digits to two now
52:11 - and if I change it again and then create
52:13 - another clone then the third clone I
52:16 - created has the value of digits to three
52:18 - so that's how it works each clone I
52:20 - create has a different value of digits
52:24 - but yeah um anyways now we want the
52:28 - Clones to show or hide based on the
52:30 - score so let's say right now the score
52:33 - is two then we only want the uh ones
52:37 - place clone to show or uh this one and
52:40 - then we want all the other ones to hide
52:43 - so to do that let's grab an if else
52:46 - statement in the control drag that in
52:49 - the further Loop
52:51 - and then we want to check
52:53 - um if the length of the score is less
52:56 - than its own variable of digits so let's
53:00 - grab a lesser than operator
53:03 - and then let's grab a length of
53:07 - and let's go to variables
53:10 - and then drag the score variable inside
53:13 - of the length of
53:15 - drag this into the left side
53:17 - and check if a length of score is less
53:19 - than digits
53:21 - so if it is that means we don't need
53:25 - that number
53:26 - and then we just hide it
53:29 - otherwise we want it to show
53:32 - so now as you can see
53:34 - um since the score was two now only one
53:37 - of the digits to show so let's say the
53:40 - score was maybe uh
53:43 - like 270
53:47 - now all three of them show so yeah now
53:50 - we want these clones to show the correct
53:52 - number
53:53 - so um to do that let's go to looks
53:57 - and if you want them to switch costume
54:00 - based on their uh digit in the score
54:04 - so to do that let's go to operators
54:07 - grab the letter operator or actually
54:11 - letter one of Apple
54:12 - and then let's replace the one with
54:15 - digits
54:16 - and then Apple with score
54:20 - now let's drag this inside of the switch
54:22 - costume tube then let's drag this under
54:25 - the show
54:28 - So based on their own digits uh one two
54:31 - and three they're going to show the
54:33 - letter of the score so one two and three
54:36 - so yeah as you can see this shows the
54:39 - correct score
54:40 - now let's reposition this to the top so
54:43 - um just change this y value to maybe uh
54:46 - 150
54:48 - Maybe
54:50 - 155 and I think that's fine and now we
54:54 - can hide the score variable
54:56 - now um I think I'm going to want my
54:58 - score to be in the middle but however
55:01 - there is a problem
55:02 - so since the score is in the middle when
55:05 - the length of the score increases I
55:07 - still want my score to stay in the
55:09 - middle so right now it's not going to
55:11 - work let's say I set the score to
55:16 - um a really high number
55:17 - let's say like this
55:19 - and this score has a one two three four
55:23 - seven digits so let's set it and as you
55:26 - can see this number is not in the middle
55:28 - because it's still in the same X
55:31 - position
55:32 - so um I want to fix that so that this
55:35 - number is in the middle no matter how
55:37 - many digits the score is
55:39 - so to do that uh let's grab a length of
55:43 - score so length of and then score
55:48 - and we want this to move back based on
55:50 - the length of the score right so
55:53 - um now let's go to operators
55:54 - grab a multiplication operator
55:57 - drag this on the left side
55:59 - and make sure to multiply this by the
56:01 - same number you multiplied the digits by
56:03 - so in my case it would be 10
56:07 - and now we want to subtract this from
56:10 - the original X position so let's grab a
56:13 - minus operator drag this on the left
56:16 - side drag this on the right side
56:18 - and oh yeah one more thing since we want
56:21 - the score to stay in the middle we want
56:23 - to divide this by two
56:27 - so let's put this on the left side
56:29 - and then divide by two all right now
56:34 - let's drag this inside of the minus
56:36 - operator and drag this back
56:39 - so as you can see the number is now in
56:42 - the middle let's try it out so
56:45 - let's say the score is zero
56:49 - then into the middle
56:51 - now let's try uh a hundred
56:53 - still in the middle let's try a thousand
56:56 - and it's still in the middle all right
56:59 - um and just to make this more clear like
57:01 - uh these numbers here I'm just going to
57:03 - create a variable
57:05 - and I'll just name this space
57:08 - between
57:11 - digits I guess
57:13 - then I'll click ok
57:15 - and
57:16 - um
57:18 - I'll just set this to
57:21 - 10
57:23 - and then drag this to replace the tens
57:27 - all right now it's more clear
57:28 - and it's also easier to change because I
57:31 - can just change this variable to
57:33 - increase or decrease the space
57:35 - so I think I'm going to increase it to
57:37 - maybe 12.
57:39 - and all right I think that looks good so
57:42 - yeah now let's try it out
57:45 - and let's see how the score variable
57:46 - works
57:48 - all right it looks pretty good
57:51 - so I'm going to try to get to 10
57:54 - oops okay let me try again
57:57 - so we have zero right now
57:58 - one two three
58:01 - four
58:02 - dang it okay let me try again
58:07 - okay um I don't think I'm gonna get to
58:09 - 10 but uh
58:11 - let's just assume that the score
58:12 - variable Works based on my testing so
58:15 - yeah now that we fix the pipes and added
58:19 - a number counter
58:21 - um now I'm going to add a loose screen
58:23 - so right now when the bird touches the
58:26 - pipes
58:27 - then the Game Stops and that's sort of
58:30 - boring I want the player to be able to
58:32 - maybe have an option to restart the game
58:35 - so to do that
58:37 - um let's create a new Sprite
58:40 - and
58:42 - I'm just going to create a simple loose
58:44 - screen
58:50 - all right so now I have my loose screen
58:52 - and this is going to show up when the
58:54 - game ends so let's go to the code
58:58 - and I actually want this to be
59:00 - transparent so
59:02 - um let's just grab a winfide clicked
59:05 - then let's go to looks
59:08 - um grab this set color effect to zero
59:11 - and change this to Ghost and let's
59:14 - change this to maybe a 50.
59:17 - okay maybe less so 20.
59:20 - and all right maybe a 15 actually
59:23 - and now this blue screen is sort of
59:26 - transparent so now I'm going to create
59:29 - another Sprite
59:31 - and this is going to be for the retry
59:34 - button
59:34 - [Music]
59:39 - all right so now I am done with the
59:42 - retry button and I also changed the
59:44 - loose screen by adding a crying bird so
59:48 - yeah
59:49 - anyways um let's start with the loose
59:51 - screen
59:52 - or actually oh yeah for the retry button
59:54 - I want it to be transparent too so let's
59:58 - also grab a set ghost effect to 15.
60:04 - let me change that to maybe a 25
60:08 - or 30
60:09 - all right so let's go to the loose
60:11 - screen
60:12 - so um we want to First hide this when
60:16 - the flag is clicked
60:17 - however we want this to show when the
60:20 - bird loses
60:21 - so let's go to the bird
60:24 - and
60:26 - right here in the if touching Sprite 2
60:28 - or Y position is less than negative 171
60:32 - we want to broadcast a message to tell
60:35 - the loop screen that the bird lost so
60:38 - let's go to control
60:40 - or actually uh events and then broadcast
60:44 - a new message
60:46 - let's just call this um
60:49 - lose
60:51 - and let's put this in the if touching
60:55 - Spike 2 or Y position is less than
60:58 - negative 171
60:59 - and instead of stop all let's just stop
61:03 - this script so the bird would just um
61:06 - stop all of this and stop moving so yeah
61:10 - all right now in our loose screen we
61:12 - want to grab a when I receive lose then
61:15 - we want the loose screen to show so we
61:18 - just grab a show
61:21 - and this should be good let's also do
61:24 - the same thing for the retry button
61:27 - so when I receive lose then show
61:32 - otherwise when the flag is clicked then
61:34 - hide
61:35 - so yeah let's try it out right now
61:38 - so when the bird crashes into the pipe
61:42 - then there's a you lose
61:43 - and we see that the birds stop moving
61:46 - however the pipes are still moving so to
61:49 - fix that let's just go to the pipes
61:51 - and then grab a when I receive lose
61:55 - then let's uh
61:58 - stop all and change this to stop other
62:02 - scripts in Sprite
62:04 - so by doing that it just stops this
62:06 - block over here and this block over here
62:09 - so now let's try it again
62:11 - when the bird falls let's say
62:12 - then everything stops
62:14 - oh yeah except for the background so
62:16 - let's go to the background
62:18 - and drag a
62:20 - uh when I receive lose
62:23 - then stop other scripts in the Sprite
62:25 - all right let's try it out
62:28 - and now as you can see everything stops
62:30 - now we want this replay button to
62:32 - actually work because right now this
62:35 - doesn't do anything
62:36 - so let's go to the retry button
62:39 - and then let's see
62:42 - um inside of the when I receive lose we
62:44 - want to drag in a further Loop
62:47 - and let's drag in if else statement
62:51 - and then let's go to sensing
62:54 - let's detect if Mouse is down
62:58 - then let's say let's make the retry
63:00 - button a bit darker
63:02 - so let's go to looks
63:05 - and then
63:06 - grab the set color effect to zero drag
63:09 - this inside of the if Mouse down
63:11 - let's change this to brightness
63:14 - and
63:16 - let's set this to
63:18 - maybe negative 10. so this makes it
63:21 - darker let's try it out
63:24 - oh yeah sorry I meant if touching Mouse
63:27 - pointer not if Mouse down so let's
63:29 - actually change that
63:31 - let's go to sensing
63:32 - grab a touchy Mouse pointer and let's
63:36 - replace the mouse down
63:38 - and now let's try it out
63:40 - so as you can see it's now darker
63:43 - however if the mouse pointer is not
63:46 - touching the button anymore
63:47 - we want it to go back to its original
63:50 - brightness
63:51 - so let's go to looks
63:54 - grab the set brightness effect to
63:58 - and let's change it back to zero
64:01 - all right let's try it out
64:03 - and as you can see there's a bit of a
64:06 - button touching effect
64:08 - all right so now we want it to detect if
64:12 - the mouse pointer is down and then we
64:14 - want to restart the entire game
64:16 - so let's go to control
64:19 - grab an if statement
64:21 - put this inside of the if touching Mouse
64:23 - pointer
64:25 - and now we drag the mouse down inside of
64:27 - the if statement
64:29 - and if the mouse is down
64:31 - then we want to let's say broadcast a
64:34 - new message
64:36 - so let's go to events
64:38 - and broadcast a new message let's just
64:41 - say uh
64:43 - play
64:46 - now let's drag this inside of the if
64:48 - Mouse down
64:49 - let's also stop this entire script after
64:52 - it broadcasts play so that it doesn't
64:56 - keep on broadcasting play so let's just
64:59 - drag a stop all and change this to South
65:03 - despite or stop the script
65:05 - so right now it's not going to do
65:08 - anything
65:08 - and that's because we need the Sprites
65:11 - to restart all of their actions when the
65:13 - play is broadcasted
65:15 - so let's first go to the chicken
65:19 - and instead of the win flag clicked
65:22 - let's replace that with the when I
65:24 - receive play
65:27 - like this
65:28 - all right let's do the same for the
65:31 - pipes so instead of the win flag clicked
65:34 - we want the when I receive play
65:38 - then it does all of that and for the
65:41 - background
65:42 - let's replace the win flag clicks
65:47 - and for the number counter
65:51 - replace the win flag clicked
65:56 - and then for the you lose
66:01 - replace the one fly clicked
66:06 - and also for the retry button
66:11 - all right so now that we've replaced all
66:14 - of the windfly clicked with plays that
66:16 - means that now all of this is replayable
66:19 - so as long as we call the play message
66:23 - then all of this is going to restart
66:26 - however uh when we click the flag we
66:29 - still want to broadcast play right
66:31 - because we want to start the game when
66:33 - we click the flag so yeah I'm just going
66:35 - to put this inside of the chicken
66:37 - and now it should work
66:40 - so it starts the game
66:43 - everything works as normal until we lose
66:45 - and then we start
66:47 - and everything restarts however as you
66:51 - can see there are some problems so let's
66:53 - go to the pipes
66:55 - and I think the problem is because the
66:59 - Clones don't get deleted when um the
67:02 - lose message is broadcasted so let's
67:05 - grab a delete this clone after I receive
67:08 - loose so all of the clones from the
67:11 - previous game should get deleted now
67:13 - let's try it again
67:15 - so when the bird crashes the pipe and
67:18 - then restarts
67:19 - then it works
67:21 - all right cool
67:23 - and one thing for the number counter
67:26 - it's actually better to probably add a
67:29 - when flag clicked
67:31 - then um do all this stuff because we
67:35 - only need to do this once when the green
67:37 - flag is clicked so yeah
67:40 - now this should be good so oh yeah since
67:45 - there's also a clone for the background
67:48 - to make sure there aren't any extra
67:50 - clones on the screen when I restart then
67:53 - we want to delete the Clone
67:56 - so yeah
67:58 - uh
68:01 - now I think this should be good
68:04 - oh yeah okay I forgot to stop other
68:07 - scripts in the Sprite for the number
68:09 - counter so let's just do that just in
68:11 - case
68:12 - so when I receive lose then
68:15 - stop other scripts in this Sprite
68:18 - all right and we don't want to delete
68:21 - these clones because we're only creating
68:23 - them once when the flag is clicked so
68:26 - yeah now let's try it again
68:28 - so everything works as normal
68:31 - then when we lose then there's the loose
68:34 - screen and then if we retry
68:37 - then everything works as normal
68:41 - oops okay except for the number counter
68:43 - so let's see
68:46 - okay actually let me just still add a
68:49 - delete this clone after lose and then
68:52 - let's replace the winfly clicked with
68:56 - um when I receive
68:58 - play
69:00 - all right now I think this should work
69:02 - let's try it out
69:04 - so everything works
69:06 - as normal
69:08 - then we try
69:10 - and
69:12 - it works all right cool
69:15 - so now we have a replayable game
69:21 - and okay what happened here
69:23 - that's weird oh yeah that was because my
69:25 - mouse pointer was on the retry button
69:28 - so uh yeah
69:31 - but
69:33 - yeah this works
69:35 - all right let's see
69:40 - and you lose and then we try
69:44 - and then it restarts
69:47 - all right cool
69:52 - this is part four on how to make a
69:54 - Flappy Bird game in scratch
69:56 - in this tutorial I will be making some
69:58 - improvements to the loose screen adding
70:00 - a countdown text and adding a menu
70:02 - screen
70:03 - so first off our clones of the pipe and
70:06 - the hills don't show up when the game is
70:08 - over and that's because we delete the
70:11 - Clones when the game is over since we
70:13 - don't want the Clones to reappear when
70:15 - the game restarts however we still want
70:18 - them to show when the you lose screen
70:20 - pops up but we can't really put the
70:23 - delete this clone after the when I
70:26 - receive play because it wouldn't really
70:28 - work so let's just say um for the pipes
70:30 - for example
70:31 - I move the delete this clone from the
70:34 - when I receive lose to when I receive
70:37 - play
70:39 - then if you try it
70:40 - then we lose and then we start
70:42 - then there's these clones of these pipes
70:45 - and it still doesn't work so to fix this
70:48 - we need to broadcast a message after the
70:52 - when I receive lose but before the when
70:54 - I receive play and this way we can
70:56 - safely delete our clones in between the
70:59 - losing and the play
71:01 - so I'm going to first put this back
71:04 - and all right this also ties in
71:06 - perfectly with making the countdown text
71:09 - because the countdown is going to happen
71:12 - after the you lose but before the game
71:15 - starts so what I was thinking for the
71:17 - countdown is that when the game starts
71:19 - it's going to show up like a three two
71:21 - one start and then the game is going to
71:23 - actually start like this so when the
71:26 - countdown is happening the game's gonna
71:27 - actually be paused but yeah
71:31 - so let's make the countdown text uh
71:34 - let's first create a new Sprite
71:36 - and I'm just going to type in the number
71:39 - three
71:42 - all right
71:43 - I'll make this a bit larger
71:46 - like this
71:47 - and then I'll duplicate this
71:49 - I'll type in two
71:52 - duplicate this again type in one and
71:55 - then duplicate this again
71:57 - then I'll type uh go
72:02 - then I'll make sure to Center this in
72:04 - the middle
72:06 - all right so on the screen over here
72:08 - it's going to be three two one go so
72:12 - this is going to be our countdown text
72:14 - all right so currently when the green
72:17 - flag is clicked we broadcast play
72:20 - however we don't want to do that because
72:22 - we want to broadcast our countdown text
72:24 - to start instead
72:26 - so let's create a new message and I'll
72:29 - just call this
72:31 - um start
72:32 - countdown
72:34 - all right click ok
72:36 - and then when the green flag is clicked
72:38 - we want to actually broadcast start
72:40 - countdown
72:41 - so let's go to our countdown Sprite
72:44 - in our countdown Sprite we want to
72:46 - receive the start countdown
72:50 - and then when it receives it we want to
72:52 - first show it
72:56 - and then let's go to motion
72:58 - make sure it goes to X Y zero zero so
73:01 - it's in the center like this
73:05 - and then we want to go to looks and then
73:08 - switch costume to costume one which is
73:11 - the number three
73:13 - and then go to control
73:16 - let's wait maybe 0.5 seconds
73:20 - and then let's actually duplicate this
73:23 - switch costume and wait
73:25 - so duplicate this and then put it under
73:29 - then we want to switch costume to
73:32 - costume two
73:33 - which is the number two
73:35 - and then wait 0.5 seconds
73:38 - and then duplicate this again
73:40 - switch costume to costume one
73:43 - or actually three sorry
73:45 - and then switch costume to costume four
73:47 - which is the go
73:50 - so it's going to be like this three two
73:52 - one go and then at the end we actually
73:55 - want to hide this so go to looks
73:58 - and then hide it
74:00 - so it's like this three two one go and
74:03 - then hide
74:04 - right so if we try it right now
74:06 - then we have our countdown
74:09 - but we actually want the countdown to
74:11 - start the game after it's finished
74:14 - so at the end over here let's go to
74:16 - events and then broadcast
74:20 - play after it finished counting down
74:24 - so let's try it again
74:25 - three two one go and then the game
74:28 - starts all right cool however we still
74:31 - want the game to initialize when the
74:34 - green flag is clicked because right now
74:36 - there's like nothing right and then when
74:38 - the game starts then everything is put
74:40 - into place but we want everything to be
74:42 - ready when the countdown is counting
74:44 - down like this
74:46 - so to do that it's actually pretty easy
74:47 - we have to just go to Every Sprite and
74:50 - then make sure it's in the correct place
74:52 - when it receives the countdown message
74:54 - so for example in the chicken we want it
74:57 - to set its change in y to zero so that's
75:00 - not moving and then go to this position
75:03 - and then set size to 80. and that's
75:06 - going to be under when I receive start
75:09 - countdown
75:10 - so just change that and then for the
75:12 - rest of the actual moving script let's
75:15 - just drag a when I receive play
75:18 - so by doing this the chicken's actually
75:21 - in its starting position when the
75:24 - countdown happens like this
75:26 - all right cool so now time to do the
75:28 - pipes
75:30 - so let's see
75:33 - um
75:34 - I think for the pipes it's fine because
75:36 - when the countdown is happening we don't
75:38 - want any pipes to spawn so the pipes are
75:40 - okay
75:41 - but let's see the Hills
75:44 - so of course when it receives the
75:46 - countdown
75:48 - we want the hill to be in the middle so
75:52 - go to zero zero and then go backwards 10
75:55 - layers so it's on the very back
75:58 - and I think this is fine and then we can
76:01 - just drag this back inside of the
76:03 - winning receive play
76:05 - and let's see how it looks
76:08 - so the hills in the correct position
76:10 - all right
76:12 - and now I think the only thing missing
76:14 - is the number counter or the score
76:16 - counter
76:17 - so let's go to the score counter
76:20 - and let's see
76:22 - let's change the winner received play to
76:25 - when I receive start countdown
76:27 - so pretty much the score counter creates
76:30 - all of its clones and then the Clones
76:31 - show and stuff like that when the score
76:33 - starts counting down or the countdown
76:36 - Sprite starts counting down sorry so
76:38 - yeah let's try it out now oh yeah and we
76:41 - also need to hide our you lose screen
76:44 - and retry button when the countdown
76:46 - starts so let's go to our you lose
76:48 - Sprite
76:50 - and change the play to start countdown
76:54 - and do the same thing for retry button
76:57 - change the whenever receive play to when
76:59 - I receive start countdown
77:02 - all right let's try it again now there's
77:04 - the countdown
77:05 - and then the game starts
77:07 - all right cool let's try it again
77:11 - there's the countdown
77:12 - and then the game starts
77:15 - all right so the countdown now works
77:18 - when the green flag is clicked however
77:20 - the countdown does not work yet when the
77:22 - retype button is clicked and that is
77:25 - because for the retry button
77:27 - when the button is clicked it broadcasts
77:30 - play but we need to change that to
77:32 - countdown or start countdown so
77:35 - when the mouse is down then broadcast
77:37 - start countdown all right let's try it
77:39 - again
77:40 - so countdown and then let's just say we
77:43 - lose the game then we try
77:45 - and then there's the countdown
77:47 - all right cool so we added the countdown
77:51 - and the countdown seems to work
77:54 - all right but however we still need to
77:56 - fix the problem with the loose screen
77:58 - because the Clones are disappearing so
78:01 - to prevent the clones from deleting when
78:03 - the loose screen starts up let's move
78:04 - the delete this clone into the when I
78:08 - receive start countdown not after when I
78:10 - receive lose
78:12 - so let's first go to our pipes
78:14 - and then where it says delete this clone
78:18 - inside of the when I receive lose let's
78:20 - change this to
78:22 - when I receive start countdown
78:24 - and then delete this clone
78:27 - and same thing for the Hills
78:30 - so instead of the delete this clone
78:32 - inside of the window receive lose we
78:35 - drag a we're actually in here whenever C
78:38 - star countdown then delete this clone
78:42 - all right let's try it now
78:44 - so there's a countdown
78:45 - then let's lose the game
78:48 - and now as you can see the pipes show up
78:50 - and the hill shows up and for some
78:52 - reason our retry button is in the back
78:54 - over here so I'm just going to make it
78:58 - go to the front layer
79:01 - when the lose is received all right
79:05 - let's try it again
79:07 - countdown and then lose the game
79:09 - and then there we go now we have a fully
79:13 - functioning loose screen
79:14 - cool so let me just try it out
79:17 - it's like this
79:20 - and then when the game is lost then
79:22 - essentially everything pauses and it's
79:24 - all good all right so now I sort of
79:27 - wanted to add a bird knockback animation
79:30 - when the game loses for example when the
79:33 - bird crashes into the pipe the bird sort
79:35 - of jumps backwards like that so I'm
79:38 - going to add that let's uh go to the
79:41 - bird Sprite
79:42 - and then since we want the bird to do
79:45 - its animation when the game is lost
79:47 - let's grab a when I receive lose
79:51 - then uh let's make the bird sort of jump
79:54 - so we want to of course
79:57 - change the or actually set the change in
80:00 - y
80:02 - a to let's say seven
80:04 - now we want to go to control and then
80:07 - grab a repeat until block
80:10 - put it after the change in y to seven
80:13 - and then let's repeat until the bird is
80:16 - lower than the bottom edge of the screen
80:18 - so repeat until
80:21 - the Y position is less than
80:24 - uh what is it I think I have it over
80:26 - here oh yeah negative 171
80:31 - all right
80:32 - drag this inside of the repeat until
80:35 - and then after the bird is lower than
80:38 - negative 171 in the Y position
80:41 - then it's going to hide so drag the hide
80:43 - after the repeat until
80:46 - and then while it's still greater than
80:48 - negative 171 then we want it to
80:52 - um just duplicate this so change y by
80:55 - change in y drag inside of the repeat
80:58 - until
80:59 - and then we want to also make sure the
81:02 - change in y is decreasing
81:04 - so also copy this one
81:06 - change change in y by negative 0.8
81:10 - and then drag this inside of the
81:12 - repeating two
81:14 - all right so let's try it out
81:16 - so when the bird crashes into the pipe
81:20 - then it sort of jumps like that all
81:23 - right I think I'm gonna make the bird
81:25 - also go backwards a bit so let's go to
81:28 - motion and then drag a change X by let's
81:33 - say
81:34 - negative one
81:37 - that's drag it in there
81:39 - and let's try it out
81:41 - oops okay and our bird is hidden that is
81:44 - because I hit it over here but then I do
81:47 - not show it again when the game starts
81:49 - so let's go to looks and then grab a
81:51 - show
81:52 - drag it after the when I receive start
81:55 - countdown
81:56 - all right let's try it again
81:58 - there's the bird
82:01 - when it hits the pipe
82:03 - then it does that all right cool let's
82:06 - see it again
82:09 - the bird when it hits the pipe let's say
82:11 - here
82:12 - it sort of jumps backwards
82:14 - all right
82:15 - um and I'm also going to make sure that
82:17 - the bird points in direction of 90
82:20 - degrees when the game starts all right
82:23 - and I think it works
82:29 - so let's see um oh yeah I realized that
82:32 - the score does not reset until the start
82:35 - countdown finishes but we want the score
82:37 - to reset when you start countdown begins
82:40 - so let's see where the score is set oh
82:43 - right here all right and let's actually
82:46 - set the score
82:47 - when I receive start countdown all right
82:51 - now the score resets to zero when the
82:54 - start countdown begins and it should be
82:55 - fine
82:58 - all right cool
82:59 - like this
83:03 - okay
83:06 - and now I sort of remember seeing some
83:08 - bugs when I was play testing this game
83:11 - so let me just try to find them
83:13 - um let's see
83:18 - um oh yeah
83:20 - right there um when you press retry
83:23 - before the bird is finished falling
83:26 - it sort of doesn't work like that
83:27 - because the bird is still falling so
83:30 - let's go to our bird
83:32 - and let's see
83:35 - it stops all other scripts in the Sprite
83:38 - so let's put it before everything over
83:40 - here and that is because when the game
83:42 - restarts while the bird is still falling
83:45 - then the bird is going to keep on
83:47 - falling so we need to make sure that we
83:49 - stop the falling bird Sprite or script
83:52 - and then it should work all right let's
83:55 - try it again
83:57 - so when the bird is falling and then
83:59 - click retry
84:01 - then it works
84:05 - let's see I remember seeing something
84:07 - else that was a problem
84:09 - um I think it was the pipes so let's see
84:16 - um
84:21 - okay I don't see anything right now
84:29 - hmm
84:34 - okay that's a problem so I think when
84:37 - you press retry right after the bird
84:39 - dies then it doesn't work so let's try
84:42 - it
84:43 - oops okay it's right here so I'm just
84:46 - gonna spam click this
84:49 - and then yeah the game doesn't really
84:51 - work
84:52 - so let's see how I can fix this
84:55 - um
84:57 - see it again
85:00 - all right
85:01 - so that just stops working
85:05 - so I think the best way to fix this is
85:09 - to just go to the retry button
85:11 - and then adding a weight let's say 0.1
85:16 - seconds
85:17 - before it runs the code about the
85:20 - touching the mouse pointer and stuff
85:21 - like that
85:22 - so I think this should fix it let me
85:25 - just try it again
85:29 - all right that fixes it
85:31 - so when I click it super rapidly
85:33 - there's no more
85:35 - um weird pipe issues
85:37 - so that's fine
85:40 - all right cool so I think I fixed all of
85:43 - the bugs for now
85:45 - um now I'm going to create a simple menu
85:47 - screen so first of all I need to create
85:49 - a menu button so let's
85:52 - um just duplicate this retry button
85:56 - and then let's go to costumes
86:00 - and I'm going to change this to menu
86:05 - and that should be fun
86:07 - all right so now I'm going to position
86:09 - this
86:11 - downwards a bit
86:13 - maybe right here
86:19 - all right so I'm just going to drag this
86:22 - go to x y
86:24 - let's say after the when I receive lose
86:28 - and for the retry button
86:30 - I'm going to do the same
86:32 - so
86:34 - go to zero zero
86:36 - all right
86:37 - so now I have the retry and menu button
86:40 - so when I click the menu button
86:43 - I want it to broadcast a new message
86:46 - and let's just name this menu
86:49 - when we click the menu button we want it
86:52 - to actually go to the menu so let's go
86:55 - to stage
86:57 - and then I'm going to create a new
86:59 - backdrop
87:02 - and this is going to be my menu backdrop
87:05 - and for now I'm just going to create a
87:08 - rectangle
87:09 - that's
87:11 - the color white
87:13 - or actually a light blue works too
87:17 - it's like this
87:19 - all right
87:23 - a bit wider
87:26 - okay
87:27 - and then I'm just gonna add some text
87:30 - saying menu
87:37 - and
87:39 - this should be fine for now
87:42 - all right so now in our stage we want to
87:46 - make sure that when it receives menu
87:49 - so an event when I receive menu
87:53 - then we want to switch backdrop to
87:55 - backdrop 2 which is the menu backdrop
87:58 - and then when I receive
88:03 - um start countdown which is the game
88:06 - starting with the countdown text
88:09 - then we want to switch backdrop to
88:10 - backdrop one which is our game
88:12 - background
88:14 - so yeah right now it should work with
88:16 - just the background change
88:21 - all right and then menu
88:22 - and like that the menu changes however
88:25 - if we go to the menu we want everything
88:27 - else to disappear so let's go to the
88:31 - Sprites one by one and then make sure
88:32 - the High when they receive menu
88:34 - so let's first go to the bird
88:38 - all right so let's go to events
88:42 - when I receive menu
88:44 - then you want to hide
88:47 - and then
88:48 - go to control or actually events or
88:51 - sorry control and then
88:54 - stop other scripts in Sprite
88:57 - all right so this ensures that nothing
88:59 - else in the chicken Sprite is going to
89:01 - run
89:02 - and that should be fine
89:04 - now let's drag this into also our pipe
89:07 - Sprite
89:10 - and let's add a delete this clone at the
89:13 - end
89:13 - to make sure all the Clones are gone and
89:17 - then drag this into our Hill Sprite
89:20 - all right drag this into our number
89:23 - counter Sprite
89:26 - also our loose screen
89:29 - however we don't need this delete this
89:31 - clone since there are no clones in this
89:33 - blue screen
89:35 - and we also don't need this stop other
89:38 - scripts in Sprite since there are no
89:40 - Loops in here so it's fine
89:43 - and let's go to let's say our number
89:46 - counter and then drag this into our
89:49 - retry buttons right
89:51 - let's take out the delete this clone
89:53 - because there are no clones in this
89:55 - Sprite
89:57 - and
89:58 - I think this should be fine oh yeah also
90:01 - the menu button
90:03 - all right
90:05 - and it should be good let's try it out
90:08 - count down and then lose the game then
90:10 - menu
90:11 - oh yeah this is another bug when you
90:13 - lose the game right win a pipe is
90:16 - spawned then the pipe still uh moves
90:20 - because the stop other scripts in Sprite
90:23 - is called right before the pipe starts
90:26 - moving so yeah I am going to fix this in
90:30 - the next part of the series though but
90:32 - anyways let's go back to
90:35 - looking at the menu so let's try it
90:37 - again
90:39 - when the bird loses then menu
90:42 - then as you can see everything hides and
90:44 - we are at the menu so now on the menu
90:46 - screen we want a play button so to do
90:49 - that let's just copy the menu button
90:53 - and let's go to costumes change this to
90:56 - play
90:58 - or actually start
91:02 - and then let's go to the code
91:04 - and let's see
91:06 - in the when I receive menu we want the
91:09 - button to show
91:12 - and actually do all this stuff so we
91:15 - just take this out and then change the
91:18 - loose to menu
91:19 - and it should be fine
91:21 - and then when the mouse is down
91:24 - we want the start button to broadcast
91:27 - play or actually start countdown
91:30 - and then that should be fine
91:32 - um let's see
91:35 - all right and when I receive start
91:37 - countdown we want the start button to
91:39 - hide
91:41 - and also
91:43 - to
91:44 - stop
91:46 - other scripts in the Sprite
91:49 - oh actually oh we already have it here
91:50 - so it's fine yep that's good
91:54 - and I think we should be good
91:57 - so let's try it out
92:00 - oops okay everything is gone
92:02 - or actually the hills and that's because
92:04 - I need to make sure
92:06 - I show The Hills when the start
92:09 - countdown is received like that all
92:13 - right let's try it out
92:14 - okay
92:17 - then when the bird crashed the pipe and
92:20 - then menu
92:21 - then there's our start button all right
92:24 - and then when we press start
92:26 - then there's our countdown
92:28 - okay everything seems normal
92:32 - and everything seems to work
92:36 - now I'm just going to reposition the
92:37 - start button to maybe the middle over
92:40 - here
92:42 - so right here
92:44 - that is y position 23
92:48 - all right and
92:51 - this should be good
92:54 - menu and then menu all right now since
92:57 - we have a menu when the green flag is
92:59 - clicked we don't want it to start the
93:01 - game but we want it to go to the menu
93:04 - so instead of broadcasting start
93:06 - countdown we want to broadcast menu
93:10 - and now it should be fine so when the
93:13 - green flag is clicked
93:14 - it shows a menu
93:16 - and then we can start
93:18 - all right and our game works like normal
93:23 - and then when the bird crashes it shows
93:26 - the animation and then we can retry
93:31 - and we can also go to the menu
93:34 - all right so there we have it we have
93:36 - our basic menu we have a working retry
93:39 - button and blue screen and we also added
93:42 - some countdown text
93:47 - this is part five on how to make a
93:49 - Flappy Bird game in scratch and in this
93:51 - video I am going to make the menu look
93:53 - better at some sound effects fix some
93:55 - bugs and re-explain all the code in the
93:58 - project anyways let's get started so the
94:01 - first thing I want to fix before I do
94:02 - anything else is that I forgot to make
94:05 - it so that you can't hold the mouse
94:07 - button because right now
94:09 - when you hold the mouse button the bird
94:11 - sort of floats up and we don't want that
94:14 - because we only want the bird to jump
94:17 - once when you tap the button and if you
94:20 - hold the button the bird still only
94:21 - jumps once so that's what we want so to
94:24 - do that we just actually have to go to
94:26 - control
94:27 - and then grab a wait until block go to
94:30 - operators grab a knot
94:33 - and then go to sensing
94:36 - and then grab a mouse down
94:38 - and let's drag this after the set change
94:41 - in y and point in Direction inside of
94:43 - the if Mouse down
94:45 - and now what this does is that after you
94:47 - hold the mouse button down it runs the
94:50 - set change in y and point in Direction
94:52 - and then you have to release the mouse
94:54 - pointer before running this again so now
94:57 - this prevents the player from holding
94:59 - down the mouse button however we can't
95:01 - put this if Mouse down inside of this
95:03 - forever Loop anymore because while it's
95:06 - waiting for not Mouse down then nothing
95:08 - else would run so we want to separate
95:10 - this if Mouse down from the forever Loop
95:13 - and then let's just go to events
95:16 - grab a separate when I receive play and
95:20 - then grab a further loop from the
95:21 - control
95:23 - and then drag this if Mouse down stuff
95:25 - inside of the forever Loop
95:28 - all right now let's try it out
95:32 - all right
95:33 - and then if I try holding
95:36 - then the bird still jumps like normal
95:39 - let me try it again
95:41 - like this if I hold then the bird still
95:44 - only jumps once
95:46 - all right cool
95:48 - so we fixed that problem
95:52 - and something else that may happen when
95:54 - you play the game is that when you lose
95:56 - the game right when another clone of the
95:59 - pipe spawns the cloned pipe keeps moving
96:02 - normally across the screen instead of
96:05 - freezing so let's go to the pipes to see
96:08 - what's wrong
96:10 - um
96:12 - let's see what can we fix in here
96:16 - okay let me first try to recreate the
96:18 - bug so I have to crash into the pipe
96:21 - right when a new pipe spawns
96:24 - okay that was a bit too late
96:26 - let me try it again
96:30 - okay A bit too early now
96:33 - uh let me see
96:37 - okay still a bit too early
96:40 - um
96:43 - okay A bit too late now
96:50 - all right so I managed to get the bug
96:53 - and as you can see the newly spawned
96:55 - pipe keeps scrolling through the screen
96:57 - and we don't want that so let's go to
97:00 - our pipes now
97:02 - and I think what happens is that
97:06 - um
97:07 - the pipe creates a clone at the exact
97:10 - same time that the bird loses and then
97:14 - it's supposed to stop all other scripts
97:16 - in the Sprite
97:17 - but it doesn't stop the create clone of
97:20 - myself because it's the exact same time
97:22 - and then that ends up the newly created
97:25 - clone not stopping all of its scripts
97:28 - and then keep on going
97:30 - so that's the problem I think so to fix
97:33 - that we have to create a new variable
97:37 - and then I'll just call this
97:41 - uh
97:42 - lost
97:45 - and then yep click ok
97:49 - and when the flag is clicked
97:52 - or actually when I receive
97:56 - um play
97:59 - or actually start countdown
98:01 - let's set lost to no
98:05 - and then once the bird crashes into the
98:08 - pipe then we want to set loss to yes
98:11 - so let's go to the bird
98:15 - and then right here in the if touching
98:18 - Sprite 2 which is the pipe
98:20 - then we want to
98:22 - set lost to yes
98:25 - and then do all this all right now let's
98:28 - go back to our pipe
98:30 - and in the Clone over pipe we want to
98:33 - make sure that the pipe only moves if
98:36 - lost is equal to no otherwise we want
98:38 - the pipe to pause so let's go to control
98:41 - grab an if statement
98:43 - and then go to operators grab an equals
98:46 - and then go to variables grab a lost
98:49 - and then check if lost is equal to no
98:53 - then do all of this stuff inside of the
98:55 - repeat until
98:57 - oops I'm going to make sure that I also
98:59 - get the set size to 150 in there
99:04 - all right
99:05 - so let's try it out
99:07 - I'm going to try to make sure the bird
99:09 - loses right when the pipe spawns to see
99:11 - if the problem is fixed
99:14 - all right I'm gonna go to Project view
99:16 - so it's a bit easier
99:17 - and let's try it
99:19 - so
99:21 - let me make sure that the pipe just
99:23 - spawns
99:25 - okay that was a bit too late I think
99:30 - okay A bit too early now
99:36 - okay A bit too early again
99:39 - I think I need to be like one frame
99:41 - later
99:42 - okay that was too late
99:47 - okay so I can't recreate the exact
99:50 - problem that we used to have but I'm
99:52 - pretty sure the problem is fixed so
99:54 - let's go back inside of the project
99:58 - and okay
99:59 - let me first reposition the loose screen
100:02 - I think I accidentally dragged it so
100:04 - I'll just drag it go to zero zero
100:08 - um after the when I receive moves
100:11 - all right
100:12 - and now that I think all of the bugs are
100:16 - fixed I'm going to create a better
100:18 - looking menu
100:21 - [Music]
100:33 - all right so I am done with the menu and
100:37 - I separated the title into a new Sprite
100:41 - so instead of putting it inside of the
100:43 - backdrop I made it its own separate
100:46 - Sprite and that's because I want the
100:48 - title to maybe move around a bit so yeah
100:51 - and I also added some
100:53 - um sun rays and I made these a separate
100:56 - Sprite also because I'm gonna add some
100:58 - ghost effect because I want the Rays to
101:01 - be transparent so yeah anyways I made
101:04 - the button look a bit better and added
101:07 - some hills in the background and yeah
101:09 - all right so I'm gonna first go to the
101:12 - Sunbeam Sprite and then I'm going to go
101:15 - to a control or actually event and then
101:17 - drag a when I receive menu
101:21 - then I'm going to go to looks
101:23 - and then I'm going to set the ghost
101:26 - effect to maybe let's try 50.
101:31 - all right
101:33 - um let's try 40.
101:35 - maybe 30
101:38 - not like 40 better all right and then
101:40 - I'm also going to make them go
101:43 - to the back so go to back layer
101:47 - all right and I think they look better
101:50 - and now for the title
101:53 - I am also going to drag a when I receive
101:56 - menu
101:59 - then I think I'm going to make the title
102:01 - go up and down by a tiny bit so I'm
102:04 - going to
102:07 - um I guess grab a repeat
102:09 - and then I'm going to repeat maybe 10
102:11 - times
102:12 - and I'm going to change y by let's say
102:19 - 0.5
102:21 - and then I'm going to duplicate this
102:24 - and then change y by negative 0.5
102:28 - and let's see how this looks
102:30 - all right so it goes up and down like
102:32 - that
102:34 - okay so I think we can repeat this
102:38 - so let's go to control and then grab a
102:40 - farther Loop and put this around the two
102:43 - repeats
102:44 - and the C
102:47 - and it jumps up and down like that all
102:49 - right
102:51 - um also I'm going to grab a win I
102:54 - receive
102:56 - uh start countdown
102:58 - then I am going to
103:03 - hide the Sprite and then stop all other
103:06 - scripts in the Sprite so in control
103:10 - and then stop other scripts in Sprite
103:13 - and also for my uh sunbeams I'm going to
103:17 - do the same thing so when I receive
103:19 - start countdown
103:20 - then hide
103:22 - and we don't need the stop other scripts
103:25 - in the Sprite because there are no Loops
103:28 - in here so we're fine
103:29 - all right let's see
103:31 - and okay our title is gone and we have
103:35 - to reshow it so let's drag a show after
103:38 - the when I received menu
103:41 - and also a show for the sun beams
103:45 - that should be good
103:46 - all right let's try it out
103:49 - so there's the bouncing title and when
103:51 - we press start
103:53 - then the game starts as normal
103:56 - all right cool
104:00 - so I think this is going to be our title
104:03 - screen now
104:04 - and let's see
104:06 - okay and now I'm going to make some
104:09 - changes to the you lose screen
104:14 - [Music]
104:24 - all right so this is going to be our you
104:26 - loose screen and for the retry and menu
104:29 - buttons I am going to take out the ghost
104:32 - effect so I'm going to set it back to
104:34 - zero so it's fully visible all right
104:38 - and that should look better
104:41 - okay
104:42 - so now we have our updated loose screen
104:47 - so let's see it again
104:51 - and our loose green right here
104:55 - and lastly I am going to now add some
104:57 - sound effects
104:59 - so let's see of course we want a
105:02 - flapping sound effect for our bird
105:04 - so let's go to our bird and then let's
105:06 - go to sounds
105:08 - and now let's create a new sound
105:10 - we can actually choose the sound
105:13 - so the scratch 3.0 editor has a great
105:15 - selection of sounds you can choose from
105:17 - like all of these so I'm going to try to
105:20 - find some maybe flapping sound let me
105:23 - search it up
105:24 - flap okay nothing let me go to effects
105:28 - all right so low whoosh sounds pretty
105:31 - good it sounds like this
105:35 - so let's select this
105:37 - and I'm going to first trim this so
105:40 - let's click this trim tool over here
105:42 - and I'm just going to trim
105:44 - this much of it
105:46 - and then click save
105:48 - and now let's see
105:51 - I might make it slower
105:54 - okay A bit slower
105:59 - okay I think that's fine for now
106:02 - so let's go back to our code
106:04 - and to add the sound it's really easy
106:07 - all we need to do is in our if Mouse
106:10 - down
106:11 - we just want to go to sound and then add
106:14 - a play sound low whoosh so let's put
106:17 - this right after
106:19 - and that should be fine so let's try it
106:21 - out
106:23 - now when the bird flaps
106:26 - there's the low whoosh sound
106:31 - all right cool
106:33 - so I think that sounds pretty good and
106:35 - oh yeah we don't want the sound to play
106:37 - when we're selecting a button though
106:40 - like
106:43 - if we click retry then the sound still
106:45 - plays and we don't want that so let's
106:48 - see
106:51 - um
106:53 - I think in our when I received lose
106:58 - we can go to control and then grab a
107:01 - stop other scripts in the Sprite
107:04 - and let's put it right after it receives
107:06 - lose
107:07 - so this is where the bird sort of jumps
107:09 - back when it like hits a pipe or
107:11 - something so yeah now let's try it out
107:16 - okay
107:18 - and then when it loses
107:21 - there is no more sound
107:23 - and all right it works
107:27 - so our flapping sound works for the bird
107:30 - oops
107:31 - and that should be fine
107:33 - all right so I think I also want a
107:36 - button sound so when we hover over it
107:38 - there's the sort of button click sound
107:41 - effect or something like that
107:43 - so let's see
107:45 - um let's go to sounds again
107:47 - and let's try to find the sound alright
107:49 - so I found a good sound it's called wood
107:52 - tap
107:53 - sounds like this
107:57 - so I think this is going to be when we
107:59 - hover over the button
108:02 - let's see I might make it slower
108:10 - actually this is fine so yeah let's
108:12 - leave it like that okay this is fine now
108:15 - let's go back to the code
108:17 - and in all of our buttons we want to add
108:21 - that would tap sound
108:22 - and okay I think I accidentally added
108:24 - that to the loose screen so oops
108:27 - but we can just drop this sound into our
108:30 - buttons like that
108:32 - so let's do that
108:34 - and in our buttons
108:37 - we can now add this when it's touching
108:39 - the mouse pointer so let's go to sound
108:42 - and then add the start sound
108:46 - would tap
108:48 - let's place this after the if touching
108:50 - Mouse pointer or actually let's not do
108:53 - that because it won't work because since
108:55 - this if statement is constantly checking
108:58 - if it's touching the mouse pointer the
109:00 - sound would constantly play so we don't
109:02 - want that we only want the sound to play
109:04 - once when the mouse enters the button
109:06 - area
109:07 - so let's grab a separate event when I
109:11 - receive lose
109:13 - and then let's grab a forever Loop
109:16 - and we can just grab an if statement and
109:20 - then check if it's touching the mouse
109:22 - pointer
109:23 - then we want to start the sound wood tap
109:26 - and then let's go to control
109:28 - and wait until
109:31 - it's not touching the mouse pointer
109:35 - and now that should be fine so this
109:37 - ensures that the sound only plays once
109:39 - when the mouse pointer enters
109:41 - so let's try it out that is for the
109:44 - retry button so let's go to the retry
109:46 - button
109:50 - and then as you can see
109:52 - the button sound plays
109:57 - all right so let's do the same thing for
110:01 - the menu button let's just drag this
110:03 - inside of the menu Sprite or menu button
110:06 - Sprite
110:08 - and then that should be fine because the
110:11 - menu button Sprite has almost the same
110:13 - code as the retry button Sprite so we're
110:15 - good now let's drag this into our start
110:17 - button
110:19 - okay and then instead of when I receive
110:22 - lose we want this to be when I receive
110:24 - menu
110:25 - now let's try it out
110:29 - okay there's your start button Sprite
110:34 - and okay
110:36 - [Laughter]
110:40 - so this works fine like that
110:43 - however first thing I noticed was that
110:46 - the countdown Sprite showed on the menu
110:49 - so we want to go to events drag a winner
110:52 - receive
110:54 - menu
110:55 - then we want to hide the countdown
110:56 - Sprite
110:58 - all right
111:00 - and a second thing that I noticed was
111:02 - that when the game starts
111:04 - you can still hover over the menu button
111:07 - Sprite because it's still there
111:10 - so let's go to our start button in our
111:13 - menu
111:15 - and let's see
111:17 - oh yeah we have to make sure that when
111:20 - the start button is clicked we want to
111:22 - also
111:24 - um stop other scripts in the Sprite
111:27 - including the button sound effect so
111:31 - yeah that's why this was playing because
111:33 - this forever Loop was still going
111:36 - so now that we added the stop other
111:38 - scripts in Sprite it stops everything in
111:41 - the start button Sprite all right let's
111:43 - try it again
111:45 - so there's our sound effect
111:47 - and okay
111:49 - um let's see
111:51 - oh yeah okay so the stop other scripts
111:54 - in Sprite also stopped this
111:56 - so let's just drag this hide inside of
111:58 - the if Mouse down
112:01 - and that should be fine all right
112:04 - and there we go
112:09 - okay
112:13 - oh and I think the same thing for the
112:15 - mini button
112:16 - so we want to stop other scripts in the
112:19 - Sprite
112:20 - for the menu button and let's also drag
112:24 - the hide inside of the if Mouse down
112:27 - instead of the start countdown
112:31 - and let's check the retry button
112:34 - okay same thing so drag a stop I'll
112:37 - description Sprite
112:40 - and that should be fine oh yeah let's
112:43 - drag the hide inside of the if Mouse
112:46 - down
112:47 - and let's try it again
112:50 - okay
112:54 - all right
112:57 - okay our menu button is still there
112:59 - so let's see oh yeah we still have to
113:02 - include the when I receive start
113:04 - countdown because when we restart the
113:07 - game we still have to hide the menu
113:09 - button so yep my bad let's drag this
113:12 - back
113:13 - let's also drag this inside of the retry
113:15 - button Sprite
113:17 - just in case
113:18 - and that should be fine all right
113:27 - okay
113:29 - the money button is still
113:31 - running okay to fix this we have to go
113:35 - to
113:37 - um control
113:39 - and then stop other scripts in the
113:41 - Sprite win start countdown is received
113:45 - and that should be fine
113:47 - let's do the same thing for the retry
113:49 - button
113:50 - so stop other scripts in Sprite
113:52 - when start countdown is received and now
113:55 - let's try it again
113:57 - okay
114:01 - all right no more
114:03 - button tapping sound effects in the game
114:07 - I mean when the game starts
114:15 - all right
114:24 - and I think that works Okay cool so we
114:27 - have the button sound effect down
114:31 - and now I think I'm going to add a sound
114:34 - effect to when the bird passes a pipe
114:37 - maybe some like
114:38 - high pitched ding sound effect or maybe
114:41 - a bell or something
114:42 - so let's try to find that
114:44 - um let's see
114:46 - let's go to our
114:48 - uh pipe
114:51 - let's see
114:54 - yep so let's go to sounds now and I'm
114:58 - going to find the sound okay I found the
115:01 - sound effect and it's this sort of coin
115:04 - sound effect
115:05 - like that
115:07 - so let's add this
115:10 - and I'm just going to trim this to here
115:14 - and I might make this higher pitched
115:17 - let's see
115:20 - foreign
115:23 - yeah I think a higher pitch sounds
115:25 - better
115:29 - okay and now this is going to be our
115:32 - score increase sound effect so let's go
115:36 - to our code
115:38 - and right in here when the bird passes
115:41 - the position of the pipes
115:43 - then we want to go to sounds and then
115:46 - start the sound of the coin
115:49 - all right let's try it out
115:57 - all right there it is
116:02 - okay
116:04 - that seems pretty good let's try it
116:06 - again
116:11 - all right and one more sound effect I
116:13 - think I will add is uh when the bird
116:17 - crashes into the pipe
116:19 - we sort of need some bump sound effect
116:21 - so let's go to our bird Sprite and then
116:25 - I will find a sound
116:28 - alright so there weren't any small
116:30 - bumping sound effects but I think
116:32 - beatbox one will do so it's like this
116:40 - so I think I'm gonna only use the first
116:43 - part of the sound effect
116:45 - so when it does this
116:48 - okay so right around here so I'm going
116:51 - to trim about this much of it let's try
116:53 - it
116:55 - okay A bit more
116:58 - or here
117:11 - all right so I think this much is fine
117:13 - I'm going to save this
117:17 - all right
117:18 - and let's drag the sound into when the
117:22 - bird crashes into the pipe
117:25 - so right here
117:27 - let's drag the start sound
117:31 - of beatbox one inside of the if touching
117:34 - Sprite 2 which is the pipe or if the Y
117:37 - position is less than negative 171.
117:40 - all right let's try it out
117:48 - okay that sounds pretty good let's try
117:51 - it again
117:52 - when it falls off
117:54 - okay I think that's good and of course
117:57 - you can record your own sound effects if
117:59 - you want you can also find them online
118:01 - there's some good sites where you can
118:03 - download some free sound effects but
118:06 - anyways that's pretty much it so I'm
118:09 - just going to do some more playthroughs
118:11 - of the game
118:12 - so does the menu
118:15 - okay I'm going to go to the project page
118:18 - all right
118:19 - so this is the menu
118:21 - we have our start
118:25 - this is our gameplay
118:37 - all right
118:45 - let's crash into the pipe
118:48 - foreign
118:51 - okay
118:53 - let me retry
118:59 - okay
119:01 - let's go back
119:02 - and let's start again
119:13 - of course you can make the game Harder
119:15 - by decreasing the space between the
119:17 - pipes
119:19 - all right
119:26 - oops that was some lag right there
119:31 - but yeah anyways that's the entire game
119:33 - anyways that's it for this video and
119:36 - that's it for this entire series

Cleaned transcript:

hello everyone in this video I will be showing you how to make a flappy bird type game in scratch for those of you who don't know what scratches scratch is a blockbased programming language where you can drag and drop blocks to create projects it's more of an educational type of visual programming language to teach children how to code there's also a online community where you can view other people's projects and share your own anyways to get started go to scratch.mit.edu which is the scratch website once you're there you can either create a new account by clicking the join scratch button over here or scroll down and download the offline editor which is the same thing if you're using the online version once you have created an account you can click the create button over here to start a new project so let's start by creating the bird so um I'm gonna go to the costumes of the scratch cat and I'm going to delete the second one and I'm going to clear this one and I'll draw my own bird so I'll start by creating a circle let's see about this size I think now I'm going to add a black outline to it right here to maybe a I think size five is good I'll decrease the circle a little bit though maybe to uh this big all right and since I'm making a bird I'll make it yellow on the inside so about this color all right so let's see now I'll draw the eye so um I'm drawing another Circle um I'll make it this big and I'll position this right over here okay I'll actually make this fill black and I'll keep the outline so yeah now I'm going to draw a beak so I'll draw two lines like this okay and I'll make the fill yellow actually the same color as the bird so this and then I gotta make sure the beak is under the bird so I'm going to shift it backwards like that and I think I'm going to add some legs so I'll just draw some quick lines like this and there so yeah this is a really quick uh drawing um I don't want to spend too much time drawing so that's why I quickly created a bird so yeah anyways now I am done and I'm going to go back to the code and now let's start coding the bird so I want the bird to be able to jump when I press the mouse button so to do that let's go to the events and then drag this windfly clicked onto here and now let's go to control and then grab a forever Loop and I'm going to drag and if then statement and then I'm going to go to sensing that's where the mouse down stuff is then I'll drag the mouse down into the if then so pretty much what happens is that when I press the green flag then this keeps checking if the mouse is down so now we want to actually do stuff when the mouse is down so um first of all we want the bird to be affected by gravity so pretty much when the bird falls it falls faster and faster over time so to do that we actually have to create a variable so let's go to variables and let's create one let's call this um uh y velocity and let's select for the Sprite only so pretty much this variable is only or actually a can only be used by the bird so now let's click ok and what our y velocity variable is going to do is that it's going to be the speed of the bird in the Y position which is up and down so pretty much if our y velocity is going to be 3 then the bird is going to move upwards constantly at uh three units and if our y velocity is let's say negative 10 then our bird is going to move downwards constantly by 10 units however we want the bird to move downwards uh faster and faster right we want the bird to fall faster and faster over time so we're going to actually be changing the Y velocity which means that we're going to be changing the speed in which the bird moves down over time so it's like gravity so let's first um set the Y velocity to zero when the flag is clicked and um okay let's make the birds start over here so that's like let's go to motion so negative 172 and 0 in the Y position um and then let's see so what we want is that we want the Y position of the bird to be always changing by the Y velocity variable or the speed so um actually to make this more clear I'm going to rename the Y velocity variable to uh change in y so I think that's easier to understand but anyways let's go back to the motion blocks and what I'm going to do is drag a change Y block drag it inside of the forever Loop and then I'll go to variables and drag the change in y variable inside of the change y by block so what this is is that the Y position of the bird is always going to change by the change in y so now we have to set the values for the change in y so um if we press the mouse button we want to set the change in y by let's say um nine so pretty much what happens is that when we click then the speed of the bird will be going upwards by nine and it would keep going up so let's try it out when we press then it keeps going up like that so yeah but now of course we want the bird to fall so what we can do is actually just drag a change change in y by block and put it in the forever Loop and let's change it by let's say negative zero point eight sorry negative 0.8 so since there is gravity we always want the bird to be going downwards so now let's try it out now as you can see it works um there's gravity because uh the bird keeps going down by negative 0.8 and then when we press the mouse button then the speed of the bird changes to nine so um yeah that's a really simple um jumping script we have right here and anyways that'll do it for right now uh for the bird so now let's create our pipes where the bird's gonna go through so let's click the button over here and let's create a new Sprite so um I'm just going to draw some simple pipes uh let's see I'm going to draw a rectangle like this and I'm going to make the pipes green and all right now I'm going to add another rectangle put it right here like this okay I'll make the pipes a bit thicker all right okay cool all right so this is going to be the top pipe and now we want the bottom pipe so let's create a new costume actually um let's duplicate this one and then I'm just gonna flip it so let's select the entire thing and then let's uh flip uh vertically and now we have the bottom pipe all right so we have the top and the bottom pipe so let's first name these I'll name this top pipe and this one bottom pipe and all right let's go back to the code so of course we want a winify clicked and um what we want is that we want this Sprite to be creating copies of the top and bottom pipe because we're going to have more than one pipe on the screen at any given time so just to make it easier to manage we don't want the actual Sprite to show so let's go to looks and then hide the Sprite when the flag is clicked and now um we we want the Sprite to keep creating clones so let's go to control and then drag a forever Loop and let's uh go to events um oh sorry not events of control and let's drag a create clone of myself and put it inside of the forever Loop so I'm just going to keep creating clones of the pipe and um we actually wanted to create two clones of the pipe because we have a top and the bottom pipe so if we try it right now then it's only going to create the Clones of the bottom pipe oh of course the pipes aren't shown but um anyways if we do show the pipes let's just drag it when they start as a clone and also a show then the pipes are there's like tons of clones of the pipes like that but we want the Sprite to simultaneously create the top and bottom pipes so uh let's actually first create a variable and let's name this um bottom or top pipe I guess and make sure to select for the swipe only this is very important otherwise it won't work so select for the Sprite only and then click ok and now uh what we want to do is to set bottom or top pipe and then drag it to the further Loop right before it creates a clone of itself and let's set it to top and then let's uh duplicate this and then put it under here and then we want to set bottom or top pipe to bottom and then it creates clone of itself again so I'll explain to you later what this does but pretty much the Clone is going to use this variable to know whether it is the top or the bottom pipe so anyways um let's add a weight in here so let's go to events actually a control and then let's drag a way to one second and I'll change this to maybe three seconds all right and now in the when I start as a clone we want to show it and now we want to add a if else statement so let's drag that and we want to check if it's the top pipe then it switches its costume to the top pipe costume and if it's the bottom pipe then it's going to switch costume to the bottom pipe costume so that's why we use this variable so um let's do that so let's go to operators grab an equals operator drag inside of here and let's go to variables grab the bottom or top pipe variable put inside here and if the bottom or top pipe variable is equal to bottom make sure it's uh spelled the same as how you spelled it here but if it's bottom then we want it to switch costume to bottom pipe and else if it is top then we switch costume to top pipe so it's as simple as that now let's try this out it's not going to work but let's just see how it is so far so as you can see this actually spawns the top and bottom pipe like that all right so now we want the top and bottom pipes to actually be positioned correctly we want the top pipe right here and bottom pipe right here so to do that uh for now let's just go to motion and grab a go to put it after the switch costume to bottom pipe and for the bottom pipe Let's uh let's see let's make it go like right here for now so we want to spawn at the edge of the screen right because the pipes are going to move from the right to the left so exposition 259 and Y position negative two one two all right and for the top pipe um let's see let's make it spawn let's say right here so 259 and Y position 54. all right so let's try that for now so as you can see the top and bottom pipes spawn like this and now we want the top and bottom pipes to move to the left side of the screen right so to do this is to um go to control and grab a repeat until block let's put that after the if else statement so what the repeat until block does is that it keeps doing something as long as the thing in here is true and then after the thing in here is false then it runs the code after so of course since we want the blocks to disappear after reaching the left side of the screen uh we want to grab a operator let's grab a lesser than operator put inside here and let's go to motion grab the X position uh block right here drag it inside of the repeat until operator and we want to check if the X position is less than a certain number then the Clones delete itself so let's see let's first show the initial Sprite and let's see right here so if the X position is less than negative 237 then the Clones should delete themselves so let's go to a control and let's grab a delete this clone and drag it after the repeat until so of course we want the pipes to be moving to the left until the X position is less than negative 237. so let's go to motion and let's grab a change X by block and put it inside of the repeat until and let's change it by let's say negative five so we want the pipes to move towards the left by five units until it reaches the edge here and then it hides so yeah let's try it out and as you can see the pipes work like that and we can like increase or decrease the spawn rate so maybe you can wait like one second and we can see there's the pipes like this and they also disappear um once they touch the left edge of the screen and they appear from the right so yeah the pipes seem to be working however we want spawning in the Y position so to do that we actually have to create a new variable so let's create a new variable let's call it random uh y spawn I guess random y spawn position and let's select uh for this file only and then click ok so um what we want to do is to set a random y position for the blocks to spawn from so to do that let's first drag this um into this forever Loop before it creates clones of the pipes and let's go to operators to grab the pick random and put it inside of the set random y spawn position and um let's see let's maybe okay let's deal with this later but let's see the range in which the pipes can spawn so I'm going to show the original Sprite and I'm going to do some testing so let's see um I think the top pipe should be right here around this would be the highest point it can spawn so that's why position 153 and the lowest position for the bottom pipe is going to be let's say right here so negative 284. so for now let's just put in uh one what was it again 153 I think yeah 153 to negative 284 I think let's just double check yeah something like that all right so this is going to be the range in which the pipes can spawn but oh yeah one important thing I think to make this easier let's go do the costumes and make sure that the pipes are actually positioned where we want them so let's say uh let's copy this bottom pipe and put it into the top pipe for now and let's say we want our space to be this big right then we want to make sure that the top pipe and bottom pipe are positioned like this in each of their costumes so I'm going to move this to the middle right here okay I think this is the middle all right so right here so now I'm going to delete the bottom pipe or actually not yet I'm going to first duplicate this and then I'm going to delete the bottom pipe and now I'm gonna go to my duplicate and then I'm going to delete the top pipe and now we don't need this extra bottom pipe costume so yeah anyways now we have the top pipe and bottom pipe uh where we want them and I'm going to first rename this to bottom pipe all right cool so of course you can change the space in which is between the top and bottom pipe so that's up to you but yeah let's go back to the code now and let's see let's find our range in y positions again now so um let's see for the top pipe I'd say y position 79 and for the bottom pipe I'd say y position negative 79. all right that works well so now because I repositioned these two pipes to where I want them it's now super easy so all you have to do is to go to variables and then drag the random y spawn position into the go to x y and in the Y so let's drag that into here for both the top and the bottom pipe and now let's try it out so as you can see it works however the pipes are um entirely on the screen like there's some empty space but of course we can go to the costumes and change that but at least the random y position works so as you can see they're spawned randomly so to change or actually to fix the problem let's go to costumes and all we need to do is to increase this length of the rectangle so let's drag this entire rectangle down here and I'm going to drag this rectangle upwards like this all right now I'm going to select the entire thing and then drag it back up I think it was right around here uh okay maybe a bit more downwards yeah about right all right and now let's do the same for the bottom pipe move it up here drag the rectangle down here and then drag the entire thing back down so right around here I think so yeah all right looks good um okay I think this one's positioned a bit to the left so I'll move it back maybe this one a bit to the left all right cool so now let's run it and as you can see the pipes now spawn like this they're in a random y position and the entire pipe uh covers like both the top and the bottom edges of the screen so awesome um I think I'm going to increase the Gap a bit because I don't think the bird can go through like very easily or uh if it's possible at all so let's increase the Gap and to do that it's really simple you just move the top and the bottom pipe upwards and downwards so the top pipe upwards like this and the bottom pipe downwards like this all right and make sure your Gap is equal on both the top and the bottom compared to the middle like over here versus over here so yeah it looks about right now let's try it and now the Gap is much larger so awesome um I'll make the bird a bit smaller I think so I'll go back to the bird I'm gonna go to looks and change the size or set the size to maybe 80. okay I think that's better so yeah now I think for the bird it looks a bit like too still when it jumps so I think I'm going to rotate it when it jumps so it looks like it's actually flapping so to do that let's um just go to motion and drag a point in Direction and drag it under the if Mouse down and I'm going to change it to um let's say 45 degrees and what this does is that it's going to change it to like this when it drops but of course we want the bird to rotate back to its original position which was 90 degrees so let's just grab an if statement and then put it inside of the forever Loop and let's go to operators grab a lesser than operator and we want to check if the direction which is in the motions is less than 90 which was its starting Direction then we want it to turn uh clockwise let's say three degrees so pretty much if the bird is like this then it's Gonna Keep rotating until it faces the right so let's try it out now as you can see there is some motion with the bird so when it flaps it sort of moves back like that so I think it looks better like this and I might change it to maybe turn four degrees so let's try it all right I think that looks much better so yeah um now let's make a simple lose state so when the bird touches the pipes then let's just stop the game for right now so uh let's see let's drag a if statement inside of the forever Loop and let's go to sensing and it's detect if touching Sprite 2 or the pipes then it's going to stop all so let's go to control and let's stop everything so let's try it out and yeah when it touched a pipe then the entire game stopped all right so okay I'm going to first hide all of my variables all right so now let's try it again okay and when it touched the pipe then the entire game stopped all right cool okay and it's like this okay um I think I'm going to add a simple background so I'll go to backdrops here go to costumes or backdrops and then I'm going to fill it or actually I'll convert to bitmap and then I'll fill this maybe to a light blue let's see like this and all right now we have some simple backdrop so um yeah this is our completed game we're actually not completed but a completed working game so all right cool let's see yeah this is a bit hard right now but you know you can tweak it to change the difficulty to make it easier maybe so yeah this is part two on how to make a Flappy Bird game in scratch in this tutorial I will be creating an infinite scrolling background and a scoring system so the first thing I wanted to add that I didn't do in the last video was to make the bird uh be able to lose when it reaches the bottom of the screen over here so to do that it's actually really simple let's go to operators and then grab an or statement and let's put it over here so if the bird is touching Sprite two which are the pipes or if the bird's y position is less than a certain value um let's see if it's less than negative 171 then we want to stop the game so let's try it out if the bird goes to the bottom here then the Game Stops all right so now that we're done with that I'm going to start creating the scrolling background so I was thinking of maybe adding some hills in the background and then making them moving slowly to the left to make it look like the bird is you know moving so let's do that so let's first create a new Sprite and now I'm going to draw my Hills all right so I'm done with my hill and what I did was that I just made a rectangle across the entire drawing area and then I used this vshape tool to you know add a few points and then I just moved these points around to make it curvy all right so make sure that the width of your Hill is exactly the same width as the drawing area no more no less as you can see I made this very exact so yeah and also make sure that the height of the left Edge over here is the exact same height as the height of the right Edge over here anyways uh this will do for now and let me go back to the code uh so first off I'm going to grab a one fly clicked in the events and then I'm going to make the hills go to zero zero so now it's in the center of the screen and what I want is that I want this hill to constantly move towards the left so to do that let's go to control grab a forever Loop and then let's go to motion grab the change X by block put it inside of the further Loop and let's say let's change X by negative three all right so if we try right now then the hill as you can see always moves towards the left by three units all right so um since I'm going to be testing this hill a lot I'm going to disconnect the code from the chicken and and the pipes so you know it's only the hill and I'm also going to hide the chicken all right so now this is just a hill so yeah all right cool so now that the hill moves now we want the hill to go from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen once it reaches the end over here so to do that let's grab an if statement and let's put this inside of the forever Loop and we want to check if the X position of the hills are less than a certain value so let's go to operators grab a less than operator go to motion grab an X position and let's check if the X position is less than um negative 464. so what I did was that I found the smallest possible value for this right which is a negative 465 and then I just added one so yeah so once the X position of the hills is less than negative 464 then we want it to move to the right side of the screen so since I made this hill the exact width of the screen which is 480 pixels or units then what I can do is just simply uh set X to its current X position over here multiplied by negative one so let's go to operators grab the negative one operator drag it inside of the set X2 and then go to motion grab the X position and type in negative one all right so let's try it out once the hill reaches the left side of the screen then it teleports to the right side all right so it works it's infinite like this let's see it again and all right it works so uh oh yeah one thing I noticed was that it's not very smooth as you can see here you can see that it sort of gets cut off early before it teleports to the right side so I don't really want that to happen let's say it again as you can see it doesn't completely go off the screen so that's sort of something that scratch has and to actually fix the issue I'm just going to go to looks and grab a set size to block and right before it changes X by negative three and checks if the X position is less than negative 464. I'm going to set size to 150 percent and right after the hill moves and checks for all the stuff then I'm going to set the size back to 100 percent so like this before all of your code put in set size to 1 to 50 and then right after put set size to 100 percent so this is sort of complicated to explain but pretty much what this does is that um the set size makes the hills bigger then it's actually supposed to be which is 100 percent so right before it moves it can technically go off screen but then right after it moves it changes back to its original size so you wouldn't even notice that it's 150 of its normal size so let's try it out and let's see now oh oops okay I forgot to change this to if the X position is less than negative 480 or actually a negative 479 so since the left edge of the screen is negative 240 and the entire size of this costume is 480 then half of the costume size is going to be 240 and then once you subtract 240 from negative 240 then that is the rightmost edge of the Sprite at the leftmost edge so yeah um that was again sort of confusing uh sorry but it should make sense visually so now let's try it out again and as you can see now the hill smoothly goes from the left side to the right side so let's see it again and all right so it works cool and I'm actually going to quickly add a uh dark green outline because I think the light green uh is sort of too close to the light blue color of the sky so yeah I'm just going to quickly add a line over here all right so I'm done with my outline I just pretty much added a line and then I just reshaped it using this tool to fit the hill all right so now I think it looks better let's try it again and as you can see there's the hill and then teleports back so now we need to add the second Hill because once the hill is moving then there's a lot of empty space and we don't want that so to add a second Hill all we need to do is to go to control and then create clone of myself all right and um we want to make the Clone do the exact same thing as the original Sprite however the only difference will be that the Clone is shifted to the right of the Sprite so let's grab a1sr as a clone then let's go to motion and then let's drag this go to x480 and then y0 and make sure to go to looks grab the set size to 150 put it before the go to XY and then grab the set size 100 and then put it after since uh we want the Clone to go completely off screen so yeah anyway since the Clone is going to have exactly the same code as the original Sprite we're going to create a block so let's go to my blocks and then make a block let's call this uh move then let's click ok all right now we have move and now we want to drag this um set size to 150 and stuff like that into the move and now we can drag our move block inside of the forever Loop and okay so my move block did not appear um that sometimes happens so I'm just going to refresh the page there we go so now there is the move block and let's put this inside of the fur Loop and for the Clone let's just duplicate this forever Loop and then put it under the stuff over here all right so now the original Sprite and the Clone both follow the same uh code in the move block so it's sort of simpler because if I want to change something all I need to do is change this one move block instead of you know changing to separate uh blocks like this so all right now let's see how it looks so as you can see there is now a infinite scrolling Hill background and it looks very smooth and uh yeah all right so I think there's a tiny um difference in the line I just drew so I'm just going to fix it real quick let's see it's over here okay let's try it again uh yeah you can barely tell that I have two Hills so yeah all right so now that we're done with the hill background we can add the chicken and the pipes back so let's um show the chicken then reconnect the blocks then go to the pipes reconnect the blocks also and now we can try it out and okay the hills are in front of both the chicken and the pipes so we want them to go back so let's go to looks and grab a um go backwards let's say 10 layers to make sure that it actually goes back and now let's drag this um in the when flag clicked before it creates a clone of itself and now it works like this all right cool now we have sort of some Parallax going on which is pretty much um the hill moves to the left slower than the pipes do so uh yeah um now we have our infinite background and now we're going to make a simple scoring system so let's go to the pipes and let's see we want to First create a score variable so let's go to variables then create a variable let's call this score then for all Sprites and then click ok all right so what we want to do is that if the bird goes past the middle of the pipes then we want the score to increase by one so um to do that we have to go into pipes and then we want to check if the X position of the bird is greater than the X position of the pipes so let's go to operators and grab a greater than operator and let's go to sensing grab the backdrop number of stage block and change the stage to Sprite one which is the bird and now we have our X position of Sprite 1. so if the X position of the bird is greater than the pipe X position so motion and then X position then we want to go to variables and then change score by one all right now we want to put this inside of the repeat until and now as the pipes are moving to the left it's going to constantly check so now there's uh one problem though whenever the bird is past the pipes the score goes up by a lot because it keeps checking and the score keeps going up but we only want the score to go up once so um to fix that we can just simply create a variable let's name this already scored so already scored and we want to select for the Sprite only this is very important for the Spy only then let's click ok and let's see where is my variable hmm all right so there it is already scored so um what we're going to do is to first set already scored to no because uh when the pipes spawn then the bird hasn't gone through them yet so of course the bird has not scored so let's set this to no put it um before everything in the uh if and repeat until loops and now we want to check if the bird has not yet already scored then we want to change score by one so let's go to operators grab an and and let's grab an equal and let's go to variables grab already scored and let's check if already scored is equals to no now let's drag this over here into the left side and let's put it back so of course it also checks if the bird has already scored and if it's no then it changes score by one but of course once it changes the score by one then it has scored so we don't want this to call again so we just set already scored to yes so now it's only going to call once so let's try it out all right and it doesn't quite work um the score goes up by two so let's see I think to fix this I'm going to make this um set before the score changes by one now let's try it again okay still does not work um let's see um oh yeah that is because we have both the top and the bottom pipe so it acts as two clones and they both check so what we want to do is either only make the top or the bottom pipe check so let's only make the top pipe check so to do that let's grab another operator grab an and grab an equals and let's see check if the bottom or top pipe is equal to top now let's drag this into the left side and I'll check the entire thing back in let me zoom out a bit all right and now it should work so first it checks if the X position of the bird is greater than the current pipe exposition which means that the bird went past it also checks if the bird already scored and also checks if the bottom or top pipe is equal to top then if all of these are true then it sets already scored to yes and then it changes score by one now let's try it out um first of all I'm going to set the score to zero whenever the five is clicked and now we should be good so as you can see the score changes by one every time so yeah all right it works cool let me try it again and yeah um now I have both my scrolling background and the score counter the game also ends when the bird touches the bottom of the screen like this this is part three on how to make a Flappy Bird game in scratch in this video I will be making the pipes go on screen and off screen more smoothly add a number counter for the score and add a simple blue screen anyways let's get started with the pipes so if you see the pipes right now they sort of suddenly appear at the edge of the screen and they don't really smoothly appear and they also disappear before they can completely go off screen like that so I'm going to fix that so let's first go to the pipes and then let's do the same thing we did for the background so in the last video I made the background be able to go on screen and off screen smoothly by first setting its size to a larger size than the actual size we want and then we uh position the background to where we want it and then we set the size back to its original size so let's do the same thing for the pipes so let's go to the pipes and then um right before it spawns Let's uh go to looks and then grab a set size two and let's change this to like 150 percent and then drag it right before go to x y and then let's drag a set size to 100 right after the go to XY and now let's change the uh X to like maybe 270 to completely make sure that the pipe is starting off screen and um for the top pipe let's do the same thing so set size to 150 put it before and then set size to 100 put it after so let's try it out and they still don't entirely start off screen so um okay I think it should work after we also set size to 150 percent and 100 um before and after it changes X by negative five so let's try it out so let's drag this before we change X by negative five and then drag this after the change X by negative five so now let's try it again and yeah I think that works um the pipes as you can see um Spawn from the right side of the screen uh smoothly they don't you know sort of randomly appear from The Edge so yeah and now let's uh fix the um pipes leaving the screen so right now it's still a bit choppy when they leave the screen like that let's see it again yep so still a bit choppy so to fix that all we need to do is to change this x position to a smaller number so maybe let's say if x position is less than 200 and I mean negative 260. now let's try it out oops okay let's try it again let me first reattach this and all right so let's see and cool they also leave the screen smoothly so yeah I think we uh fixed the pipes and all right now that we have the pipes fixed um now I'm going to make a number counter for the score so instead of using this variable I'm going to use actual numbers and that just makes the game look a bit better so yeah let's first create a new Sprite and just paint 10 costumes with the numbers zero through nine so yeah and yeah so now I have the numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine and then zero so the uh costume names don't matter but the order matters so make sure it's one through nine and then zero at the end so all right now let's go back to the code and let's first grab a win flag clicked then let's hide the original Sprite because we're going to be using clones for this and then let's create a variable uh let's name this I guess uh digits and then select for the Sprite only remember this is very important for the Sprite only because each clone is going to have a different value for the variable so if we do for all Sprites then it's not going to work because whenever the variable changes in value then all of the Clones are going to have the same value for that variable so we want the Clones to have separate values for the digits variable so select for this file only and then click ok all right by the way if your variable doesn't show up immediately after you created it then you can just refresh the page and it should show up but anyways um let's grab a set digits to block and let's set the digits to one and let's drag this after the hide now uh let's go to control grab a repeat Loop and then let's grab a create clone of myself and then go to variables and let's grab a change digits by one and this just creates 10 clones each with a different value of the digits so anyways now we want the Clones to do stuff right so let's go to events actually a control sorry and then let's drag a 1sr as a clone then we want the Clone to show um or actually uh not show yet but yeah so let's go to control grab a forever Loop put it under the when it starts to clone and then we want the Clones to go to a specific position based on its digits variable so let's go to motion and then drag a go to Y position sorry a go to XY position and then let's go to variables grab the digits variable and then go to operators grab the multiplication operator let's drag the digits variable inside of the left side of the operator and let's say uh let's multiply this by 10. now let's drag this inside of the X position of the go to XY and let's place this inside of the forever Loop so if I just run this what this does is that oops okay I need to show the clones for now so yep all right so if I run this then what this does is that it creates 10 clones and they are all spaced apart by 10 pixels and this is because each clone has a different digits value because when I first set digits to one and then created a clone the Clone I created the first time had the digits value set to one but then since I changed digits by one the next clone I created has the value of digits to two now and if I change it again and then create another clone then the third clone I created has the value of digits to three so that's how it works each clone I create has a different value of digits but yeah um anyways now we want the Clones to show or hide based on the score so let's say right now the score is two then we only want the uh ones place clone to show or uh this one and then we want all the other ones to hide so to do that let's grab an if else statement in the control drag that in the further Loop and then we want to check um if the length of the score is less than its own variable of digits so let's grab a lesser than operator and then let's grab a length of and let's go to variables and then drag the score variable inside of the length of drag this into the left side and check if a length of score is less than digits so if it is that means we don't need that number and then we just hide it otherwise we want it to show so now as you can see um since the score was two now only one of the digits to show so let's say the score was maybe uh like 270 now all three of them show so yeah now we want these clones to show the correct number so um to do that let's go to looks and if you want them to switch costume based on their uh digit in the score so to do that let's go to operators grab the letter operator or actually letter one of Apple and then let's replace the one with digits and then Apple with score now let's drag this inside of the switch costume tube then let's drag this under the show So based on their own digits uh one two and three they're going to show the letter of the score so one two and three so yeah as you can see this shows the correct score now let's reposition this to the top so um just change this y value to maybe uh 150 Maybe 155 and I think that's fine and now we can hide the score variable now um I think I'm going to want my score to be in the middle but however there is a problem so since the score is in the middle when the length of the score increases I still want my score to stay in the middle so right now it's not going to work let's say I set the score to um a really high number let's say like this and this score has a one two three four seven digits so let's set it and as you can see this number is not in the middle because it's still in the same X position so um I want to fix that so that this number is in the middle no matter how many digits the score is so to do that uh let's grab a length of score so length of and then score and we want this to move back based on the length of the score right so um now let's go to operators grab a multiplication operator drag this on the left side and make sure to multiply this by the same number you multiplied the digits by so in my case it would be 10 and now we want to subtract this from the original X position so let's grab a minus operator drag this on the left side drag this on the right side and oh yeah one more thing since we want the score to stay in the middle we want to divide this by two so let's put this on the left side and then divide by two all right now let's drag this inside of the minus operator and drag this back so as you can see the number is now in the middle let's try it out so let's say the score is zero then into the middle now let's try uh a hundred still in the middle let's try a thousand and it's still in the middle all right um and just to make this more clear like uh these numbers here I'm just going to create a variable and I'll just name this space between digits I guess then I'll click ok and um I'll just set this to 10 and then drag this to replace the tens all right now it's more clear and it's also easier to change because I can just change this variable to increase or decrease the space so I think I'm going to increase it to maybe 12. and all right I think that looks good so yeah now let's try it out and let's see how the score variable works all right it looks pretty good so I'm going to try to get to 10 oops okay let me try again so we have zero right now one two three four dang it okay let me try again okay um I don't think I'm gonna get to 10 but uh let's just assume that the score variable Works based on my testing so yeah now that we fix the pipes and added a number counter um now I'm going to add a loose screen so right now when the bird touches the pipes then the Game Stops and that's sort of boring I want the player to be able to maybe have an option to restart the game so to do that um let's create a new Sprite and I'm just going to create a simple loose screen all right so now I have my loose screen and this is going to show up when the game ends so let's go to the code and I actually want this to be transparent so um let's just grab a winfide clicked then let's go to looks um grab this set color effect to zero and change this to Ghost and let's change this to maybe a 50. okay maybe less so 20. and all right maybe a 15 actually and now this blue screen is sort of transparent so now I'm going to create another Sprite and this is going to be for the retry button all right so now I am done with the retry button and I also changed the loose screen by adding a crying bird so yeah anyways um let's start with the loose screen or actually oh yeah for the retry button I want it to be transparent too so let's also grab a set ghost effect to 15. let me change that to maybe a 25 or 30 all right so let's go to the loose screen so um we want to First hide this when the flag is clicked however we want this to show when the bird loses so let's go to the bird and right here in the if touching Sprite 2 or Y position is less than negative 171 we want to broadcast a message to tell the loop screen that the bird lost so let's go to control or actually uh events and then broadcast a new message let's just call this um lose and let's put this in the if touching Spike 2 or Y position is less than negative 171 and instead of stop all let's just stop this script so the bird would just um stop all of this and stop moving so yeah all right now in our loose screen we want to grab a when I receive lose then we want the loose screen to show so we just grab a show and this should be good let's also do the same thing for the retry button so when I receive lose then show otherwise when the flag is clicked then hide so yeah let's try it out right now so when the bird crashes into the pipe then there's a you lose and we see that the birds stop moving however the pipes are still moving so to fix that let's just go to the pipes and then grab a when I receive lose then let's uh stop all and change this to stop other scripts in Sprite so by doing that it just stops this block over here and this block over here so now let's try it again when the bird falls let's say then everything stops oh yeah except for the background so let's go to the background and drag a uh when I receive lose then stop other scripts in the Sprite all right let's try it out and now as you can see everything stops now we want this replay button to actually work because right now this doesn't do anything so let's go to the retry button and then let's see um inside of the when I receive lose we want to drag in a further Loop and let's drag in if else statement and then let's go to sensing let's detect if Mouse is down then let's say let's make the retry button a bit darker so let's go to looks and then grab the set color effect to zero drag this inside of the if Mouse down let's change this to brightness and let's set this to maybe negative 10. so this makes it darker let's try it out oh yeah sorry I meant if touching Mouse pointer not if Mouse down so let's actually change that let's go to sensing grab a touchy Mouse pointer and let's replace the mouse down and now let's try it out so as you can see it's now darker however if the mouse pointer is not touching the button anymore we want it to go back to its original brightness so let's go to looks grab the set brightness effect to and let's change it back to zero all right let's try it out and as you can see there's a bit of a button touching effect all right so now we want it to detect if the mouse pointer is down and then we want to restart the entire game so let's go to control grab an if statement put this inside of the if touching Mouse pointer and now we drag the mouse down inside of the if statement and if the mouse is down then we want to let's say broadcast a new message so let's go to events and broadcast a new message let's just say uh play now let's drag this inside of the if Mouse down let's also stop this entire script after it broadcasts play so that it doesn't keep on broadcasting play so let's just drag a stop all and change this to South despite or stop the script so right now it's not going to do anything and that's because we need the Sprites to restart all of their actions when the play is broadcasted so let's first go to the chicken and instead of the win flag clicked let's replace that with the when I receive play like this all right let's do the same for the pipes so instead of the win flag clicked we want the when I receive play then it does all of that and for the background let's replace the win flag clicks and for the number counter replace the win flag clicked and then for the you lose replace the one fly clicked and also for the retry button all right so now that we've replaced all of the windfly clicked with plays that means that now all of this is replayable so as long as we call the play message then all of this is going to restart however uh when we click the flag we still want to broadcast play right because we want to start the game when we click the flag so yeah I'm just going to put this inside of the chicken and now it should work so it starts the game everything works as normal until we lose and then we start and everything restarts however as you can see there are some problems so let's go to the pipes and I think the problem is because the Clones don't get deleted when um the lose message is broadcasted so let's grab a delete this clone after I receive loose so all of the clones from the previous game should get deleted now let's try it again so when the bird crashes the pipe and then restarts then it works all right cool and one thing for the number counter it's actually better to probably add a when flag clicked then um do all this stuff because we only need to do this once when the green flag is clicked so yeah now this should be good so oh yeah since there's also a clone for the background to make sure there aren't any extra clones on the screen when I restart then we want to delete the Clone so yeah uh now I think this should be good oh yeah okay I forgot to stop other scripts in the Sprite for the number counter so let's just do that just in case so when I receive lose then stop other scripts in this Sprite all right and we don't want to delete these clones because we're only creating them once when the flag is clicked so yeah now let's try it again so everything works as normal then when we lose then there's the loose screen and then if we retry then everything works as normal oops okay except for the number counter so let's see okay actually let me just still add a delete this clone after lose and then let's replace the winfly clicked with um when I receive play all right now I think this should work let's try it out so everything works as normal then we try and it works all right cool so now we have a replayable game and okay what happened here that's weird oh yeah that was because my mouse pointer was on the retry button so uh yeah but yeah this works all right let's see and you lose and then we try and then it restarts all right cool this is part four on how to make a Flappy Bird game in scratch in this tutorial I will be making some improvements to the loose screen adding a countdown text and adding a menu screen so first off our clones of the pipe and the hills don't show up when the game is over and that's because we delete the Clones when the game is over since we don't want the Clones to reappear when the game restarts however we still want them to show when the you lose screen pops up but we can't really put the delete this clone after the when I receive play because it wouldn't really work so let's just say um for the pipes for example I move the delete this clone from the when I receive lose to when I receive play then if you try it then we lose and then we start then there's these clones of these pipes and it still doesn't work so to fix this we need to broadcast a message after the when I receive lose but before the when I receive play and this way we can safely delete our clones in between the losing and the play so I'm going to first put this back and all right this also ties in perfectly with making the countdown text because the countdown is going to happen after the you lose but before the game starts so what I was thinking for the countdown is that when the game starts it's going to show up like a three two one start and then the game is going to actually start like this so when the countdown is happening the game's gonna actually be paused but yeah so let's make the countdown text uh let's first create a new Sprite and I'm just going to type in the number three all right I'll make this a bit larger like this and then I'll duplicate this I'll type in two duplicate this again type in one and then duplicate this again then I'll type uh go then I'll make sure to Center this in the middle all right so on the screen over here it's going to be three two one go so this is going to be our countdown text all right so currently when the green flag is clicked we broadcast play however we don't want to do that because we want to broadcast our countdown text to start instead so let's create a new message and I'll just call this um start countdown all right click ok and then when the green flag is clicked we want to actually broadcast start countdown so let's go to our countdown Sprite in our countdown Sprite we want to receive the start countdown and then when it receives it we want to first show it and then let's go to motion make sure it goes to X Y zero zero so it's in the center like this and then we want to go to looks and then switch costume to costume one which is the number three and then go to control let's wait maybe 0.5 seconds and then let's actually duplicate this switch costume and wait so duplicate this and then put it under then we want to switch costume to costume two which is the number two and then wait 0.5 seconds and then duplicate this again switch costume to costume one or actually three sorry and then switch costume to costume four which is the go so it's going to be like this three two one go and then at the end we actually want to hide this so go to looks and then hide it so it's like this three two one go and then hide right so if we try it right now then we have our countdown but we actually want the countdown to start the game after it's finished so at the end over here let's go to events and then broadcast play after it finished counting down so let's try it again three two one go and then the game starts all right cool however we still want the game to initialize when the green flag is clicked because right now there's like nothing right and then when the game starts then everything is put into place but we want everything to be ready when the countdown is counting down like this so to do that it's actually pretty easy we have to just go to Every Sprite and then make sure it's in the correct place when it receives the countdown message so for example in the chicken we want it to set its change in y to zero so that's not moving and then go to this position and then set size to 80. and that's going to be under when I receive start countdown so just change that and then for the rest of the actual moving script let's just drag a when I receive play so by doing this the chicken's actually in its starting position when the countdown happens like this all right cool so now time to do the pipes so let's see um I think for the pipes it's fine because when the countdown is happening we don't want any pipes to spawn so the pipes are okay but let's see the Hills so of course when it receives the countdown we want the hill to be in the middle so go to zero zero and then go backwards 10 layers so it's on the very back and I think this is fine and then we can just drag this back inside of the winning receive play and let's see how it looks so the hills in the correct position all right and now I think the only thing missing is the number counter or the score counter so let's go to the score counter and let's see let's change the winner received play to when I receive start countdown so pretty much the score counter creates all of its clones and then the Clones show and stuff like that when the score starts counting down or the countdown Sprite starts counting down sorry so yeah let's try it out now oh yeah and we also need to hide our you lose screen and retry button when the countdown starts so let's go to our you lose Sprite and change the play to start countdown and do the same thing for retry button change the whenever receive play to when I receive start countdown all right let's try it again now there's the countdown and then the game starts all right cool let's try it again there's the countdown and then the game starts all right so the countdown now works when the green flag is clicked however the countdown does not work yet when the retype button is clicked and that is because for the retry button when the button is clicked it broadcasts play but we need to change that to countdown or start countdown so when the mouse is down then broadcast start countdown all right let's try it again so countdown and then let's just say we lose the game then we try and then there's the countdown all right cool so we added the countdown and the countdown seems to work all right but however we still need to fix the problem with the loose screen because the Clones are disappearing so to prevent the clones from deleting when the loose screen starts up let's move the delete this clone into the when I receive start countdown not after when I receive lose so let's first go to our pipes and then where it says delete this clone inside of the when I receive lose let's change this to when I receive start countdown and then delete this clone and same thing for the Hills so instead of the delete this clone inside of the window receive lose we drag a we're actually in here whenever C star countdown then delete this clone all right let's try it now so there's a countdown then let's lose the game and now as you can see the pipes show up and the hill shows up and for some reason our retry button is in the back over here so I'm just going to make it go to the front layer when the lose is received all right let's try it again countdown and then lose the game and then there we go now we have a fully functioning loose screen cool so let me just try it out it's like this and then when the game is lost then essentially everything pauses and it's all good all right so now I sort of wanted to add a bird knockback animation when the game loses for example when the bird crashes into the pipe the bird sort of jumps backwards like that so I'm going to add that let's uh go to the bird Sprite and then since we want the bird to do its animation when the game is lost let's grab a when I receive lose then uh let's make the bird sort of jump so we want to of course change the or actually set the change in y a to let's say seven now we want to go to control and then grab a repeat until block put it after the change in y to seven and then let's repeat until the bird is lower than the bottom edge of the screen so repeat until the Y position is less than uh what is it I think I have it over here oh yeah negative 171 all right drag this inside of the repeat until and then after the bird is lower than negative 171 in the Y position then it's going to hide so drag the hide after the repeat until and then while it's still greater than negative 171 then we want it to um just duplicate this so change y by change in y drag inside of the repeat until and then we want to also make sure the change in y is decreasing so also copy this one change change in y by negative 0.8 and then drag this inside of the repeating two all right so let's try it out so when the bird crashes into the pipe then it sort of jumps like that all right I think I'm gonna make the bird also go backwards a bit so let's go to motion and then drag a change X by let's say negative one that's drag it in there and let's try it out oops okay and our bird is hidden that is because I hit it over here but then I do not show it again when the game starts so let's go to looks and then grab a show drag it after the when I receive start countdown all right let's try it again there's the bird when it hits the pipe then it does that all right cool let's see it again the bird when it hits the pipe let's say here it sort of jumps backwards all right um and I'm also going to make sure that the bird points in direction of 90 degrees when the game starts all right and I think it works so let's see um oh yeah I realized that the score does not reset until the start countdown finishes but we want the score to reset when you start countdown begins so let's see where the score is set oh right here all right and let's actually set the score when I receive start countdown all right now the score resets to zero when the start countdown begins and it should be fine all right cool like this okay and now I sort of remember seeing some bugs when I was play testing this game so let me just try to find them um let's see um oh yeah right there um when you press retry before the bird is finished falling it sort of doesn't work like that because the bird is still falling so let's go to our bird and let's see it stops all other scripts in the Sprite so let's put it before everything over here and that is because when the game restarts while the bird is still falling then the bird is going to keep on falling so we need to make sure that we stop the falling bird Sprite or script and then it should work all right let's try it again so when the bird is falling and then click retry then it works let's see I remember seeing something else that was a problem um I think it was the pipes so let's see um okay I don't see anything right now hmm okay that's a problem so I think when you press retry right after the bird dies then it doesn't work so let's try it oops okay it's right here so I'm just gonna spam click this and then yeah the game doesn't really work so let's see how I can fix this um see it again all right so that just stops working so I think the best way to fix this is to just go to the retry button and then adding a weight let's say 0.1 seconds before it runs the code about the touching the mouse pointer and stuff like that so I think this should fix it let me just try it again all right that fixes it so when I click it super rapidly there's no more um weird pipe issues so that's fine all right cool so I think I fixed all of the bugs for now um now I'm going to create a simple menu screen so first of all I need to create a menu button so let's um just duplicate this retry button and then let's go to costumes and I'm going to change this to menu and that should be fun all right so now I'm going to position this downwards a bit maybe right here all right so I'm just going to drag this go to x y let's say after the when I receive lose and for the retry button I'm going to do the same so go to zero zero all right so now I have the retry and menu button so when I click the menu button I want it to broadcast a new message and let's just name this menu when we click the menu button we want it to actually go to the menu so let's go to stage and then I'm going to create a new backdrop and this is going to be my menu backdrop and for now I'm just going to create a rectangle that's the color white or actually a light blue works too it's like this all right a bit wider okay and then I'm just gonna add some text saying menu and this should be fine for now all right so now in our stage we want to make sure that when it receives menu so an event when I receive menu then we want to switch backdrop to backdrop 2 which is the menu backdrop and then when I receive um start countdown which is the game starting with the countdown text then we want to switch backdrop to backdrop one which is our game background so yeah right now it should work with just the background change all right and then menu and like that the menu changes however if we go to the menu we want everything else to disappear so let's go to the Sprites one by one and then make sure the High when they receive menu so let's first go to the bird all right so let's go to events when I receive menu then you want to hide and then go to control or actually events or sorry control and then stop other scripts in Sprite all right so this ensures that nothing else in the chicken Sprite is going to run and that should be fine now let's drag this into also our pipe Sprite and let's add a delete this clone at the end to make sure all the Clones are gone and then drag this into our Hill Sprite all right drag this into our number counter Sprite also our loose screen however we don't need this delete this clone since there are no clones in this blue screen and we also don't need this stop other scripts in Sprite since there are no Loops in here so it's fine and let's go to let's say our number counter and then drag this into our retry buttons right let's take out the delete this clone because there are no clones in this Sprite and I think this should be fine oh yeah also the menu button all right and it should be good let's try it out count down and then lose the game then menu oh yeah this is another bug when you lose the game right win a pipe is spawned then the pipe still uh moves because the stop other scripts in Sprite is called right before the pipe starts moving so yeah I am going to fix this in the next part of the series though but anyways let's go back to looking at the menu so let's try it again when the bird loses then menu then as you can see everything hides and we are at the menu so now on the menu screen we want a play button so to do that let's just copy the menu button and let's go to costumes change this to play or actually start and then let's go to the code and let's see in the when I receive menu we want the button to show and actually do all this stuff so we just take this out and then change the loose to menu and it should be fine and then when the mouse is down we want the start button to broadcast play or actually start countdown and then that should be fine um let's see all right and when I receive start countdown we want the start button to hide and also to stop other scripts in the Sprite oh actually oh we already have it here so it's fine yep that's good and I think we should be good so let's try it out oops okay everything is gone or actually the hills and that's because I need to make sure I show The Hills when the start countdown is received like that all right let's try it out okay then when the bird crashed the pipe and then menu then there's our start button all right and then when we press start then there's our countdown okay everything seems normal and everything seems to work now I'm just going to reposition the start button to maybe the middle over here so right here that is y position 23 all right and this should be good menu and then menu all right now since we have a menu when the green flag is clicked we don't want it to start the game but we want it to go to the menu so instead of broadcasting start countdown we want to broadcast menu and now it should be fine so when the green flag is clicked it shows a menu and then we can start all right and our game works like normal and then when the bird crashes it shows the animation and then we can retry and we can also go to the menu all right so there we have it we have our basic menu we have a working retry button and blue screen and we also added some countdown text this is part five on how to make a Flappy Bird game in scratch and in this video I am going to make the menu look better at some sound effects fix some bugs and reexplain all the code in the project anyways let's get started so the first thing I want to fix before I do anything else is that I forgot to make it so that you can't hold the mouse button because right now when you hold the mouse button the bird sort of floats up and we don't want that because we only want the bird to jump once when you tap the button and if you hold the button the bird still only jumps once so that's what we want so to do that we just actually have to go to control and then grab a wait until block go to operators grab a knot and then go to sensing and then grab a mouse down and let's drag this after the set change in y and point in Direction inside of the if Mouse down and now what this does is that after you hold the mouse button down it runs the set change in y and point in Direction and then you have to release the mouse pointer before running this again so now this prevents the player from holding down the mouse button however we can't put this if Mouse down inside of this forever Loop anymore because while it's waiting for not Mouse down then nothing else would run so we want to separate this if Mouse down from the forever Loop and then let's just go to events grab a separate when I receive play and then grab a further loop from the control and then drag this if Mouse down stuff inside of the forever Loop all right now let's try it out all right and then if I try holding then the bird still jumps like normal let me try it again like this if I hold then the bird still only jumps once all right cool so we fixed that problem and something else that may happen when you play the game is that when you lose the game right when another clone of the pipe spawns the cloned pipe keeps moving normally across the screen instead of freezing so let's go to the pipes to see what's wrong um let's see what can we fix in here okay let me first try to recreate the bug so I have to crash into the pipe right when a new pipe spawns okay that was a bit too late let me try it again okay A bit too early now uh let me see okay still a bit too early um okay A bit too late now all right so I managed to get the bug and as you can see the newly spawned pipe keeps scrolling through the screen and we don't want that so let's go to our pipes now and I think what happens is that um the pipe creates a clone at the exact same time that the bird loses and then it's supposed to stop all other scripts in the Sprite but it doesn't stop the create clone of myself because it's the exact same time and then that ends up the newly created clone not stopping all of its scripts and then keep on going so that's the problem I think so to fix that we have to create a new variable and then I'll just call this uh lost and then yep click ok and when the flag is clicked or actually when I receive um play or actually start countdown let's set lost to no and then once the bird crashes into the pipe then we want to set loss to yes so let's go to the bird and then right here in the if touching Sprite 2 which is the pipe then we want to set lost to yes and then do all this all right now let's go back to our pipe and in the Clone over pipe we want to make sure that the pipe only moves if lost is equal to no otherwise we want the pipe to pause so let's go to control grab an if statement and then go to operators grab an equals and then go to variables grab a lost and then check if lost is equal to no then do all of this stuff inside of the repeat until oops I'm going to make sure that I also get the set size to 150 in there all right so let's try it out I'm going to try to make sure the bird loses right when the pipe spawns to see if the problem is fixed all right I'm gonna go to Project view so it's a bit easier and let's try it so let me make sure that the pipe just spawns okay that was a bit too late I think okay A bit too early now okay A bit too early again I think I need to be like one frame later okay that was too late okay so I can't recreate the exact problem that we used to have but I'm pretty sure the problem is fixed so let's go back inside of the project and okay let me first reposition the loose screen I think I accidentally dragged it so I'll just drag it go to zero zero um after the when I receive moves all right and now that I think all of the bugs are fixed I'm going to create a better looking menu all right so I am done with the menu and I separated the title into a new Sprite so instead of putting it inside of the backdrop I made it its own separate Sprite and that's because I want the title to maybe move around a bit so yeah and I also added some um sun rays and I made these a separate Sprite also because I'm gonna add some ghost effect because I want the Rays to be transparent so yeah anyways I made the button look a bit better and added some hills in the background and yeah all right so I'm gonna first go to the Sunbeam Sprite and then I'm going to go to a control or actually event and then drag a when I receive menu then I'm going to go to looks and then I'm going to set the ghost effect to maybe let's try 50. all right um let's try 40. maybe 30 not like 40 better all right and then I'm also going to make them go to the back so go to back layer all right and I think they look better and now for the title I am also going to drag a when I receive menu then I think I'm going to make the title go up and down by a tiny bit so I'm going to um I guess grab a repeat and then I'm going to repeat maybe 10 times and I'm going to change y by let's say 0.5 and then I'm going to duplicate this and then change y by negative 0.5 and let's see how this looks all right so it goes up and down like that okay so I think we can repeat this so let's go to control and then grab a farther Loop and put this around the two repeats and the C and it jumps up and down like that all right um also I'm going to grab a win I receive uh start countdown then I am going to hide the Sprite and then stop all other scripts in the Sprite so in control and then stop other scripts in Sprite and also for my uh sunbeams I'm going to do the same thing so when I receive start countdown then hide and we don't need the stop other scripts in the Sprite because there are no Loops in here so we're fine all right let's see and okay our title is gone and we have to reshow it so let's drag a show after the when I received menu and also a show for the sun beams that should be good all right let's try it out so there's the bouncing title and when we press start then the game starts as normal all right cool so I think this is going to be our title screen now and let's see okay and now I'm going to make some changes to the you lose screen all right so this is going to be our you loose screen and for the retry and menu buttons I am going to take out the ghost effect so I'm going to set it back to zero so it's fully visible all right and that should look better okay so now we have our updated loose screen so let's see it again and our loose green right here and lastly I am going to now add some sound effects so let's see of course we want a flapping sound effect for our bird so let's go to our bird and then let's go to sounds and now let's create a new sound we can actually choose the sound so the scratch 3.0 editor has a great selection of sounds you can choose from like all of these so I'm going to try to find some maybe flapping sound let me search it up flap okay nothing let me go to effects all right so low whoosh sounds pretty good it sounds like this so let's select this and I'm going to first trim this so let's click this trim tool over here and I'm just going to trim this much of it and then click save and now let's see I might make it slower okay A bit slower okay I think that's fine for now so let's go back to our code and to add the sound it's really easy all we need to do is in our if Mouse down we just want to go to sound and then add a play sound low whoosh so let's put this right after and that should be fine so let's try it out now when the bird flaps there's the low whoosh sound all right cool so I think that sounds pretty good and oh yeah we don't want the sound to play when we're selecting a button though like if we click retry then the sound still plays and we don't want that so let's see um I think in our when I received lose we can go to control and then grab a stop other scripts in the Sprite and let's put it right after it receives lose so this is where the bird sort of jumps back when it like hits a pipe or something so yeah now let's try it out okay and then when it loses there is no more sound and all right it works so our flapping sound works for the bird oops and that should be fine all right so I think I also want a button sound so when we hover over it there's the sort of button click sound effect or something like that so let's see um let's go to sounds again and let's try to find the sound alright so I found a good sound it's called wood tap sounds like this so I think this is going to be when we hover over the button let's see I might make it slower actually this is fine so yeah let's leave it like that okay this is fine now let's go back to the code and in all of our buttons we want to add that would tap sound and okay I think I accidentally added that to the loose screen so oops but we can just drop this sound into our buttons like that so let's do that and in our buttons we can now add this when it's touching the mouse pointer so let's go to sound and then add the start sound would tap let's place this after the if touching Mouse pointer or actually let's not do that because it won't work because since this if statement is constantly checking if it's touching the mouse pointer the sound would constantly play so we don't want that we only want the sound to play once when the mouse enters the button area so let's grab a separate event when I receive lose and then let's grab a forever Loop and we can just grab an if statement and then check if it's touching the mouse pointer then we want to start the sound wood tap and then let's go to control and wait until it's not touching the mouse pointer and now that should be fine so this ensures that the sound only plays once when the mouse pointer enters so let's try it out that is for the retry button so let's go to the retry button and then as you can see the button sound plays all right so let's do the same thing for the menu button let's just drag this inside of the menu Sprite or menu button Sprite and then that should be fine because the menu button Sprite has almost the same code as the retry button Sprite so we're good now let's drag this into our start button okay and then instead of when I receive lose we want this to be when I receive menu now let's try it out okay there's your start button Sprite and okay [Laughter] so this works fine like that however first thing I noticed was that the countdown Sprite showed on the menu so we want to go to events drag a winner receive menu then we want to hide the countdown Sprite all right and a second thing that I noticed was that when the game starts you can still hover over the menu button Sprite because it's still there so let's go to our start button in our menu and let's see oh yeah we have to make sure that when the start button is clicked we want to also um stop other scripts in the Sprite including the button sound effect so yeah that's why this was playing because this forever Loop was still going so now that we added the stop other scripts in Sprite it stops everything in the start button Sprite all right let's try it again so there's our sound effect and okay um let's see oh yeah okay so the stop other scripts in Sprite also stopped this so let's just drag this hide inside of the if Mouse down and that should be fine all right and there we go okay oh and I think the same thing for the mini button so we want to stop other scripts in the Sprite for the menu button and let's also drag the hide inside of the if Mouse down instead of the start countdown and let's check the retry button okay same thing so drag a stop I'll description Sprite and that should be fine oh yeah let's drag the hide inside of the if Mouse down and let's try it again okay all right okay our menu button is still there so let's see oh yeah we still have to include the when I receive start countdown because when we restart the game we still have to hide the menu button so yep my bad let's drag this back let's also drag this inside of the retry button Sprite just in case and that should be fine all right okay the money button is still running okay to fix this we have to go to um control and then stop other scripts in the Sprite win start countdown is received and that should be fine let's do the same thing for the retry button so stop other scripts in Sprite when start countdown is received and now let's try it again okay all right no more button tapping sound effects in the game I mean when the game starts all right and I think that works Okay cool so we have the button sound effect down and now I think I'm going to add a sound effect to when the bird passes a pipe maybe some like high pitched ding sound effect or maybe a bell or something so let's try to find that um let's see let's go to our uh pipe let's see yep so let's go to sounds now and I'm going to find the sound okay I found the sound effect and it's this sort of coin sound effect like that so let's add this and I'm just going to trim this to here and I might make this higher pitched let's see foreign yeah I think a higher pitch sounds better okay and now this is going to be our score increase sound effect so let's go to our code and right in here when the bird passes the position of the pipes then we want to go to sounds and then start the sound of the coin all right let's try it out all right there it is okay that seems pretty good let's try it again all right and one more sound effect I think I will add is uh when the bird crashes into the pipe we sort of need some bump sound effect so let's go to our bird Sprite and then I will find a sound alright so there weren't any small bumping sound effects but I think beatbox one will do so it's like this so I think I'm gonna only use the first part of the sound effect so when it does this okay so right around here so I'm going to trim about this much of it let's try it okay A bit more or here all right so I think this much is fine I'm going to save this all right and let's drag the sound into when the bird crashes into the pipe so right here let's drag the start sound of beatbox one inside of the if touching Sprite 2 which is the pipe or if the Y position is less than negative 171. all right let's try it out okay that sounds pretty good let's try it again when it falls off okay I think that's good and of course you can record your own sound effects if you want you can also find them online there's some good sites where you can download some free sound effects but anyways that's pretty much it so I'm just going to do some more playthroughs of the game so does the menu okay I'm going to go to the project page all right so this is the menu we have our start this is our gameplay all right let's crash into the pipe foreign okay let me retry okay let's go back and let's start again of course you can make the game Harder by decreasing the space between the pipes all right oops that was some lag right there but yeah anyways that's the entire game anyways that's it for this video and that's it for this entire series
