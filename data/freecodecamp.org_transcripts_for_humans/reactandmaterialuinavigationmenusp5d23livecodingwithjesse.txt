00:03 - hey everybody welcome to live coding
00:05 - with jesse i'm jesse and today we're
00:08 - going to do some
00:10 - work with our navigation
00:13 - so this will be more proper front-end
00:15 - work
00:16 - i know we've been doing some back-end
00:18 - work lately
00:21 - but
00:22 - today we're going to get back to the
00:23 - front end
00:25 - and i think i finally sorted out all the
00:28 - issues that i've been having uh with
00:31 - stream quality
00:33 - so i should be running now assuming that
00:36 - your internet connection is fast enough
00:38 - it should run
00:39 - at 1080p 60 frames
00:42 - frames per second
00:45 - the problem uh didn't have anything to
00:47 - do with my settings in obs uh it was
00:50 - with my computer so
00:53 - uh what i found was
00:55 - depending on what i had running
01:00 - i would drop a lot of frames uh so
01:04 - i've turned off
01:07 - all the programs that i don't need
01:09 - and i've closed out
01:12 - most of the tabs that i could
01:15 - and i tested out i'd i'd close
01:17 - everything and it would work i'd open
01:18 - more stuff and it didn't work so
01:21 - so far this works i tested earlier for a
01:23 - little while and it worked the whole
01:25 - time i tested it just this past half
01:27 - hour and only for a few seconds did it
01:30 - drop frames so i think we're good
01:34 - and
01:35 - i don't know really what changed the
01:37 - only thing i did differently on my
01:38 - computer other than close out a lot of
01:40 - things which we already tried before
01:42 - was uh i downloaded the latest update
01:45 - uh for the mac os
01:48 - so there was when i came in this morning
01:49 - there's an update available so i just
01:51 - went ahead and did that
01:53 - straight off and
01:57 - that that seemed to do something because
01:59 - my fan wasn't running
02:02 - you know
02:03 - basically it's been running
02:05 - really hard
02:07 - the whole time i've been using it for
02:08 - the last week
02:10 - so that's all
02:12 - all sorted out hopefully
02:15 - and
02:17 - so we'll get started i don't have
02:20 - anything going on so depending on how
02:22 - the stream goes you might be able to do
02:24 - a longer stream today uh we'll just see
02:29 - uh so let me check the live chat
02:32 - here for a second
02:34 - um
02:38 - not sure i'll see this one live
02:41 - all right so if you you are gonna be
02:43 - able to watch live that's cool
02:45 - thanks for uh for stopping in and saying
02:47 - hi
02:48 - and um as you all know you can always
02:51 - check out the recording later
02:53 - um
02:54 - savage banana says howdy complete noob
02:57 - here done a few bits on free code camp
02:59 - about to do a boot camp looking forward
03:01 - to watching you this evening even though
03:03 - i probably won't understand now i'll be
03:05 - soaking it in all right awesome thanks
03:07 - for watching and feel free to ask as
03:09 - many questions as you want don't worry
03:11 - if you think it's a noob question or
03:13 - something
03:14 - i'm i'm happy to explain something and
03:16 - go over anything that you need
03:19 - all right john said the stream's going
03:20 - well peter says it's looking clean too
03:23 - awesome
03:24 - the ninja says this channel is dope
03:26 - thank you i appreciate that
03:30 - uh abu says will you start coding now
03:33 - i will i will start coding and um
03:36 - as always i know there's some of you
03:37 - that don't like the talking part and you
03:39 - just like the coding part
03:40 - so if that's the case i mean i really
03:43 - love when you can watch live that's
03:44 - awesome
03:45 - but if if it does bother you all the
03:48 - talking uh then
03:50 - feel free to watch the recording
03:52 - and you can just skip ahead
03:54 - and um
03:56 - basically anytime you see just my face
03:58 - and no code then you're safe to skip
04:00 - that
04:02 - and that's totally fine i understand
04:04 - there's not really enough time in the
04:05 - day to listen to me go on and on anyway
04:08 - all right so let's get started
04:12 - and let's change my screen
04:16 - so
04:17 - i'll explain what we're going to do
04:20 - briefly
04:21 - and then we'll we'll get to it
04:24 - so we already talked about
04:26 - what we want to do with this navigation
04:27 - in previous streams
04:29 - in case you've forgotten or you didn't
04:31 - catch that stream here's what's going to
04:33 - happen when we click on one of these
04:35 - links
04:37 - it's going to open up this side
04:40 - drawer
04:41 - and we're gonna have the same links as
04:43 - top level navigation here so it'll say
04:46 - it won't say inbox it'll say about
04:48 - academics admissions faith and life
04:50 - and they'll all be
04:53 - expandable
04:55 - so open up this side navigation with the
04:58 - correct item expanded and all the
05:00 - options shown
05:02 - for instance if i clicked about
05:04 - the about option would be expanded
05:07 - everything else
05:08 - would be not expanded
05:12 - uh so
05:13 - that's the goal what i want to do now
05:15 - the reason i decided to switch and do
05:17 - this today instead of working on some of
05:18 - the stuff we have been working on is
05:20 - well two-fold one
05:22 - the stuff that we've been working on
05:24 - lately is going to get real repetitive
05:26 - we've worked out a lot of the
05:28 - you know kind of tough problems that
05:30 - we've had
05:31 - mostly to do with routing and bringing
05:32 - data over now it's just a matter of
05:35 - taking the time to actually do that i
05:37 - don't want to make boring streams of me
05:39 - just constantly doing the same thing
05:41 - over and over again
05:42 - and the second reason is i'm starting to
05:44 - show people this site so i showed my
05:46 - boss's site last week and
05:49 - one of the things that we went over is
05:51 - the menu and i went to click these and i
05:53 - i remembered oh we never made that work
05:57 - and he had asked it was a bit
06:00 - uh we had i discussed it before my boss
06:02 - but it was a long time ago so i had to
06:04 - go over again
06:05 - when we click this then it's going to do
06:07 - that so i think it would be a lot easier
06:09 - when i start to show it to more people
06:11 - to just have it working even if the
06:12 - links don't even go anywhere yet
06:15 - which they won't because we haven't
06:17 - built out you know most of the site yet
06:20 - but i want the functionality to work i
06:21 - think it'll be a lot easier to show
06:23 - people than to explain it
06:25 - so that's what we're going to do
06:28 - and
06:30 - let's see
06:32 - yeah let's check out the component it's
06:34 - been a while since we've even worked on
06:36 - these so i don't remember what we set up
06:38 - in the components
06:40 - and i'm going to be looking at them
06:42 - with fresh eyes basically
06:45 - so we have our app bar component
06:48 - which
06:49 - [Music]
06:51 - is where we'll have
06:55 - all right the wrap bar and our drawer
06:56 - are going to be the two components we're
06:58 - going to be working in today the most
07:00 - i already have this running let me get
07:02 - ngrok started for you all
07:15 - and i'm going to paste the link here in
07:16 - the live chat and you all can click on
07:19 - that link go to it
07:21 - and
07:25 - um
07:27 - let's see
07:30 - all right it looks like it is working
07:33 - great
07:35 - so anyway
07:37 - if you're not familiar with ngrok just
07:39 - click the link you'll be able to see
07:40 - this site
07:41 - as we're working on it and test out the
07:43 - changes you can inspect it in dev tools
07:47 - so it'll be a lot more interactive if
07:50 - you're able to to do that
07:55 - all right so let's check out
07:57 - if we have anything set up already so
07:59 - here's all our font icons now this
08:02 - component could definitely use some
08:03 - refactoring to clean it up a bit that's
08:05 - going to happen at some point but
08:09 - my opinion is
08:10 - if you have a deadline you have to meet
08:13 - you get everything working first you can
08:15 - always go back and refactor later but if
08:17 - you spend all your time refactoring and
08:19 - you don't get the project done
08:21 - nobody's gonna care the user's not gonna
08:23 - care when you try to explain to him
08:25 - about refactoring ah the stream's
08:27 - lagging again isn't it
08:30 - no
08:31 - why is it lagging maybe ngrug
08:33 - all right you know what let me shut down
08:35 - ngrok for a second
08:37 - and see if that made a difference
08:41 - because that was really the only
08:43 - different thing that we did right
08:45 - i've changed nothing else
08:59 - wow the video is lagging again
09:06 - have i
09:14 - try to think did i do anything else
09:16 - i don't think i did anything
09:19 - no
09:39 - why
09:40 - why
09:41 - why does it happen now what else is
09:43 - running on my machine
09:45 - it's nothing
09:49 - i guess i could turn off spotify
09:51 - let's turn spotify off
09:56 - um
09:57 - i'm not gonna have my music
09:59 - alright so spotify's off
10:04 - i guess that wasn't it i'm going to turn
10:06 - chrome canary off
10:09 - oh was that what i was using
10:13 - i didn't realize that was a canary
10:14 - window
10:15 - um
10:18 - and that's it i can't
10:20 - i can't turn anything else off
10:42 - um
10:47 - all right i guess i could draw
11:01 - all right am i back
11:10 - let me know if you can hear me
11:13 - obs is saying that everything's fine
11:18 - all right cool
11:21 - all right looks like this will work now
11:23 - and
11:26 - i'm gonna turn my spotify back on
11:29 - because
11:31 - that was not the problem
11:46 - all right cool
11:48 - i really thought i had that figured out
11:50 - this time
11:52 - oh well try again tomorrow
11:58 - unless i really like figure out
12:00 - something significant that fixes this
12:02 - i'm just gonna stream at 720p again
12:06 - tomorrow and not not risk it
12:09 - savage banana says try streaming at 30
12:12 - frames per second
12:13 - um yeah maybe i'll maybe i can try 1080p
12:17 - but at 30 frames per second
12:19 - see if that'll work
12:22 - i actually didn't even see a setting
12:23 - though for the frames per second which
12:25 - was weird
12:29 - it's possible i'm just looking
12:33 - in the wrong place
12:38 - oh well
12:39 - um
12:44 - all right
12:48 - so let's go
12:50 - let me start a timer
12:52 - so i can know when to come back
12:55 - and
12:56 - answer some questions
13:01 - see
13:12 - i'm gonna go i think this is harsh it
13:14 - right hard [ __ ] this is yours right
13:17 - the
13:17 - essays or pompom.now
13:23 - let's start this one
13:24 - i was using using three different
13:26 - pomodoro timers
13:28 - and uh two of them from that you all
13:31 - made and one of them that i had been
13:34 - using
13:35 - using for years
13:39 - i don't actually i don't know about
13:40 - years how long i've been to a pomodoro
13:41 - definitely more than a year
13:44 - potentially not longer than two though
13:49 - all right
13:53 - let's see
13:57 - all right let me make this a bit bigger
13:59 - so you all can see
14:01 - especially now that we've dropped the uh
14:03 - the video quality a little bit
14:07 - so hopefully that's
14:09 - large enough for you let me know if it's
14:11 - not
14:13 - so let's find our
14:18 - our menu
14:19 - see if we have any click handlers
14:21 - already on here that we can work with
14:22 - otherwise we'll make some
14:25 - let's see svg this is a search
14:32 - all right great so here's where we have
14:34 - this
14:37 - so it looks like
14:42 - all right it looks like we're using uh
14:44 - the typography component that comes with
14:46 - material ui
14:47 - to create an a tag
14:51 - and
14:57 - all right so right now just has an href
15:05 - okay
15:10 - i suppose we don't even really need it
15:12 - to be a link
15:16 - but for now
15:18 - let's
15:24 - let's see where the
15:26 - oops let me bring this
15:28 - back up
15:29 - i forgot we shut it down
15:32 - localhost
15:33 - 3
15:34 - 000.
15:36 - and let me try to bring ngrog back up
15:40 - because i don't think that was actually
15:42 - the problem
15:48 - all right so the links now
15:51 - um
15:52 - in the live chat
16:08 - all right i was just inspecting
16:11 - the this uh this is the li and this is
16:14 - just the a
16:16 - uh the a tag
16:18 - so i was wondering what would be better
16:21 - to put the link on
16:26 - or to you know have the click area
16:39 - hmm
16:42 - all right let me know what you all think
16:45 - uh
16:47 - i guess it would be
16:50 - either way it really doesn't matter i
16:52 - suppose
16:54 - except we may have a slightly larger
16:57 - area would we
16:59 - no we wouldn't
17:01 - i think it would be the same
17:08 - alright so it doesn't matter
17:18 - so let's try to do a
17:22 - an on click
17:30 - should we do an on click or non-touch
17:32 - [Music]
17:41 - anything
17:43 - untouched
17:45 - i was looking at a project that i did
17:47 - earlier and we were using on touch tap
17:49 - instead of
17:52 - on click but i can't remember why
17:56 - so i'm just going to go with on click
17:58 - and
18:02 - what we can always change it back if we
18:03 - want
18:06 - video section
18:09 - oh okay uh savage banana found the
18:11 - settings
18:12 - for the frames per second and it's on
18:14 - the
18:17 - um
18:18 - it's in the video section you know that
18:21 - that makes sense now i remember a while
18:23 - ago i had to go to the video section to
18:25 - change some stuff and i
18:27 - i remember because i thought it was it
18:29 - was weird that it was in there instead
18:30 - of the streaming
18:33 - all right harshit says that was mature
18:35 - ui uh 0.26 it's fixed
18:39 - with uh with one okay so
18:42 - we had to use it
18:44 - in a previous version but you don't have
18:46 - to use it now awesome
18:49 - uh thanks for that hardship
18:51 - all right so let's say
18:54 - um
19:08 - open side drawer
19:10 - this
19:12 - dot open side drawer all right so we
19:15 - haven't made it yet but
19:16 - we need to make it and we need to have
19:20 - we're going to pass it something huh
19:27 - yeah we have to pass it something
19:40 - all right so
19:45 - this dot open side drawer
19:47 - and
19:50 - passion
20:08 - hmm
20:22 - um
20:39 - all right so i'm just going to use the
20:40 - name
20:43 - which in this case is faith in life
20:46 - i'm gonna pass that in as a string
20:55 - we'll have to figure out maybe a better
20:57 - way to do this so we don't have to
20:58 - manually type it out but just to
21:01 - get it working first
21:04 - this should work for us
21:09 - so obviously i'd rather have a lot of
21:11 - this stuff in data files
21:14 - and then bring it in instead of having
21:17 - it all hard-coded
21:26 - i would have thought we already had some
21:28 - things built out for this
21:37 - uh all right i was thinking for some
21:39 - reason we had to have some type of click
21:41 - handler to open up the side drawer but
21:48 - we're pulling it in
21:54 - pulling that in from
22:06 - somewhere else i guess
22:13 - um
22:34 - okay
23:07 - i um think if we're going to need to
23:12 - what's this for sorry i'm trying to
23:15 - think out how this works uh we need
23:20 - so we need to be able to share what's
23:22 - going on with two components the app bar
23:24 - and the drawer so i'm assuming they're
23:25 - both tied together in the layout
23:28 - for drawer so i'm just wondering if this
23:30 - should all live in the layout
23:32 - which is where we're getting toggle
23:34 - drawer from
23:35 - so that's
23:37 - as expected i suppose
23:42 - yeah so maybe this is where the um
23:48 - where that should live
23:55 - yeah that makes sense
23:57 - um
24:02 - actually we already have an expansion
24:06 - for the drawer
24:11 - change handle click so the handle click
24:13 - we have in the drawer already expands
24:15 - the items so this is really what we want
24:17 - to use anyway
24:20 - let's pull this up into layout
24:26 - and then from app bar we should be able
24:28 - to just call this
24:30 - function and at the same time uh
24:34 - so we'll call
24:36 - this function and we'll call
24:40 - um
24:41 - the drawer toggle
24:43 - so we'll basically use what we already
24:45 - have
24:50 - i think that'll be the best way to do it
24:56 - all right john has some so faith in life
24:58 - link text should have white space no
25:02 - wrap
25:04 - all right cool thank you um
25:07 - i'll add that in
25:10 - i want to do this first why it's in my
25:11 - mind so i don't lose what i just
25:14 - what i just thought of
25:19 - all right so let's grab
25:21 - our handle click state open items the
25:24 - state open items
25:39 - all right so let me see how we need to
25:44 - pull this out i'm going to try to go
25:50 - i don't know if i could put these two
25:52 - side by side maybe if i close this it
25:54 - would work
25:58 - let me try it out
26:02 - oops
26:04 - this one's
26:08 - layout
26:10 - okay
26:28 - okay uh john has a question that has to
26:31 - do with what we're about to attempt says
26:33 - is it the best practice for a stateful
26:36 - uh furthest up container to control any
26:39 - actions below it pass with props
26:41 - if you need to share
26:46 - if you need to share the state
26:48 - then yes it should be in the parent uh
26:51 - but you you
26:52 - shouldn't get crazy with it so you
26:54 - shouldn't be passing things up like five
26:57 - components
26:58 - like five parent components
27:00 - and that's where things like redux come
27:02 - in and help simplify things so that you
27:05 - don't have to pass everything up
27:08 - from child to parent several levels up
27:10 - because then it can be really confusing
27:14 - and difficult especially if you're going
27:15 - to change something
27:17 - it trying to remember and and go in in
27:21 - every component and make sure
27:23 - you're still passing things down
27:24 - properly is can be difficult
27:28 - uh so i guess
27:30 - so we're not really using redux we're
27:32 - using
27:35 - what is it har should help me out here
27:36 - because harsh is the one was telling me
27:38 - about it
27:39 - so apollo
27:42 - now handles state in a similar way to
27:44 - redux so i guess we could do some of
27:47 - that i haven't worked with it exactly
27:50 - yet but i know that there was
27:52 - some significant update to where you can
27:55 - handle stuff but for now we only need to
27:57 - go up one
27:59 - component just to the parent so
28:02 - i'm totally fine with that
28:08 - if there's some reason why you all think
28:10 - that we should try to use something else
28:12 - to manage state
28:13 - instead of you know just passing it with
28:16 - with props then
28:18 - i'm definitely open to suggestions but i
28:20 - think this should work out in this case
28:22 - all right so here's our layout component
28:24 - this is our parent
28:26 - so what we want to do is add
28:28 - our handle click
28:32 - yeah our handle click
28:35 - we're going to add this over here i'm
28:37 - going to briefly keep the handle click
28:39 - here
28:40 - so that way
28:42 - i can see the original uh and if we edit
28:45 - this
28:46 - i can just go back quickly but then
28:47 - eventually we'll just remove this
28:51 - so what we want to do is pass down
28:53 - uh the handle click
28:55 - so
28:56 - just like we're we're handling we're
28:58 - passing down this toggle drawer
29:02 - so we have this
29:04 - toggle drawer and we're also passing
29:06 - down the state
29:10 - of this so we have this drawer uh true
29:13 - or false whether it's open or close
29:15 - we're gonna do the same thing
29:18 - we need to
29:21 - i'm gonna say handle click
29:29 - i guess we call it
29:35 - let's make this a little bit more
29:36 - descriptive
29:39 - because that's
29:41 - we're gonna have multiple click events
29:42 - going on
29:44 - uh so let's call it
29:49 - expand
29:50 - menu
29:53 - yeah that works
29:58 - expand menu
30:00 - and
30:01 - for expand menu
30:05 - this set state
30:14 - so let's make open
30:18 - open items
30:30 - that's odd how does this
30:32 - sorry i want to see how this behaves now
30:35 - we only have one item
30:41 - all right what i'm worried about here is
30:42 - our open items is just a true or false
30:45 - so i'm wondering if that works with
30:47 - multiple items
30:49 - so let's
30:53 - let's try that
30:55 - check that out quickly
31:08 - list item
31:21 - this class
31:32 - all right let's throw this in here just
31:34 - to see
31:45 - uh okay
31:47 - it's
31:48 - as i thought
31:50 - uh right now this is opening and closing
31:57 - everything
32:02 - which is not what we want
32:06 - we need to change that
32:18 - all right that's fine it's going to be a
32:19 - little bit more complex
32:24 - all right here's
32:26 - so we can do
32:38 - hmm
32:46 - all right what i'm thinking is
32:48 - so number one i want to separate this
32:51 - out
32:52 - into its own component this is way too
32:55 - much to have all of this in this
32:57 - component
32:58 - so the entire
33:01 - for sure we'll grab this whole list item
33:03 - and then the collapse
33:07 - component that comes with it
33:13 - and then we may even want to separate
33:15 - out
33:20 - this collapse as well
33:30 - yeah
33:31 - all right let's do that
33:33 - this is already
33:36 - a bit of a mess
33:41 - all right so let's open up a new
33:43 - tab here
33:59 - list item
34:02 - down to
34:08 - oops
34:15 - labs
34:17 - all right now here's what i
34:20 - we're gonna have to wrap this
34:23 - in a div
34:25 - hopefully it doesn't mess up how this
34:27 - works
34:29 - or how it looks
34:35 - yeah i don't i don't see how we could do
34:37 - that differently
34:40 - um so let's
34:42 - let's make
34:47 - we're gonna call this
35:18 - and
35:21 - render
35:26 - see how we do it
35:28 - yeah
35:29 - return
35:41 - all right great now we can
35:48 - copy and paste this down
35:57 - draw item
35:59 - and
35:59 - let's give it
36:01 - we need react
36:07 - and
36:09 - with styles
36:14 - and
36:16 - link
36:17 - for sure we need link
36:22 - wait are we using link i thought we were
36:24 - but now that i see it
36:27 - we're not all right we're not
36:30 - we need lists
36:33 - yeah we do need list and list item
36:38 - collapse
36:45 - expand less explain more
37:01 - and
37:06 - we need the divider
37:08 - i don't think so
37:11 - at least not yet
37:17 - all right now let's save this
37:22 - our components
37:23 - i'm going to call this
37:28 - drawer item
37:32 - dot js
37:35 - yay all right
37:41 - what did i mess up
37:43 - something
37:48 - oh that's right i need to put this in a
37:50 - div
38:02 - oh i think this is just indentation
38:07 - which
38:10 - all right
38:16 - fix in that problem six all in problems
38:20 - yeah let's see that all right great
38:23 - um
38:26 - classes is not defined so we need to
38:29 - make sure we bring
38:30 - that over
38:34 - classes
38:44 - oops all right the timer went off so let
38:46 - me stop here
38:48 - i'm gonna take five minutes i'm gonna
38:49 - answer any questions uh that you all
38:51 - have and then we'll come back and
38:54 - finish this up as much as we can
38:59 - also when i come back from the
39:00 - five-minute break maybe i'll take time
39:02 - to explain a little bit of what just
39:03 - happened if you're not familiar with
39:05 - react
39:06 - then this was probably
39:09 - confusing
39:14 - there we go there's a timer
39:16 - all right i'm gonna scroll up to the top
39:18 - and and try to get through as many
39:19 - questions and comments as i can if i
39:22 - don't get your question or comment
39:23 - during this five minute break i will uh
39:26 - most likely get to it in the next one
39:28 - at the end of the stream i'll get to all
39:30 - the comments and questions so just be
39:32 - patient if you can't stick around you
39:34 - can always check out the recording of
39:35 - this uh later on it'll be available on
39:38 - this channel the free code camp youtube
39:40 - channel
39:45 - um
39:47 - samir asks uh hi jesse i'm new to react
39:50 - where can i start
39:53 - um you can always check out the official
39:55 - react documentation like on the react
39:58 - website
39:59 - uh it's not bad i remember when i was
40:01 - first just new and started reading it it
40:03 - was over my head but they do have some
40:05 - beginner
40:06 - tutorials on there
40:09 - so depending on how good you already are
40:10 - with javascript you may do better with
40:13 - that than i did
40:16 - free code camp has a beta curriculum
40:18 - that you can preview and work on
40:21 - they have some react lessons on there i
40:23 - have not gone through them myself
40:25 - but i see other people on twitter have
40:28 - you know talked about going through them
40:31 - so they seem to be good
40:33 - uh
40:34 - code academy has an in-browser react
40:37 - course
40:39 - and i'm trying to think what else
40:44 - i think those are the main resources if
40:46 - you want to spend money on a course i
40:48 - did go through the
40:51 - udacity react nanodegree
40:53 - if you want to know more about that
40:55 - check out my channel i did do a short
40:57 - video of what my review of that
41:00 - nanodegree program so
41:02 - i'm not going to go over it again since
41:04 - i already have that available but you
41:05 - you can check that out the link to my
41:07 - channel is in the description for this
41:09 - video
41:11 - uh so that's where i would start out now
41:14 - uh if there are also some videos on this
41:16 - channel
41:18 - that go over you know react basics
41:20 - so you could check those out as well and
41:22 - you're more than welcome to watch these
41:24 - streams and i'll do my best to explain
41:26 - everything be sure to ask a lot of
41:28 - questions uh because i'll
41:31 - answer as much as i i possibly can
41:48 - let's see
41:50 - viconius says why programmers haven't
41:53 - got girls
41:55 - i
41:57 - i i have a wife so
42:00 - i'm a programmer and i have a wife so
42:02 - i'm not sure i'm not sure why other
42:04 - programmers might not have them i don't
42:06 - really know i mean
42:08 - i don't know that there's anything
42:10 - inherent to programmers that would make
42:11 - them not have growth i think it's just
42:13 - like a joke
42:15 - um
42:17 - i guess if you spend all your time
42:19 - inside programming then
42:22 - you might be a lot more pale than people
42:24 - like maybe i don't know
42:27 - i'm just messing around now i don't
42:28 - really know
42:29 - um the ninja says in reply says who
42:32 - jesse has a house full of hot shakes
42:35 - that's not
42:37 - i would say singular one hot chick my
42:40 - wife is very hot so
42:42 - i don't have a household i just have one
42:45 - and then uh
42:46 - i do have daughters but
42:48 - uh
42:49 - nobody say that they're they're hot
42:51 - don't talk about my daughters like that
42:54 - my daughters
42:56 - are six and one and a half so
42:59 - uh there's still
43:01 - tiny little people right now
43:05 - um
43:07 - let's see
43:14 - all right there's a lot of comments
43:16 - about the stream whenever it was lagging
43:20 - king mobile says hi to all hey how's it
43:22 - going thanks for watching
43:36 - uh superman says can you give me your
43:38 - opinion on vue.js
43:41 - i i have not used view
43:44 - i haven't even really seen tutorials
43:46 - about vue
43:47 - but i've seen a lot of people who i
43:50 - developers who i do respect that respect
43:52 - their opinion i think they're good
43:53 - developers and they really like vue
43:56 - so
43:57 - my opinion on it now
44:00 - is just
44:01 - i've heard good things about it it seems
44:03 - like it's a good framework
44:06 - so if you want to give it a shot i say
44:07 - go for it
44:09 - i'd like to try it out at some point but
44:10 - i don't have any plans to do it right
44:12 - now i i think that i'm still not
44:15 - where i want to be with my skills and
44:17 - react so the limited time that i have to
44:19 - be able to
44:21 - you know put into
44:23 - kind of training and studying more
44:25 - i'm going to put into react right now
44:28 - and you know maybe one day i'll go with
44:30 - you
44:30 - but i don't have anything against you i
44:32 - haven't to be honest with you i haven't
44:33 - heard anything negative about view it's
44:35 - all been good stuff
44:38 - so if anybody has used view uh would
44:41 - like to put your opinion in uh please
44:44 - put in the live chat now if you're
44:45 - watching the recording later on uh go
44:47 - ahead and put it in the comments and i
44:50 - think that would be helpful for anybody
44:51 - that's you know wondering about you if
44:53 - somebody who's actually used it would
44:55 - weigh in
44:56 - preferably somebody that's use you and
44:58 - react to give uh maybe a comparison
45:02 - all right so my five minute timer is up
45:04 - i'm going to jot down quickly where i
45:06 - left off in the live chat help me get
45:08 - back to it after our
45:10 - our next session
45:26 - all right
45:34 - oh hey i just noticed
45:36 - like 10 minutes ago quincy stopped in
45:39 - i'm not sure if he's still here so
45:42 - but if you are hey quincy thanks for the
45:44 - retweet
45:46 - i appreciate that
45:50 - yo if you don't know who quincy is he's
45:52 - the the founder and head of free code
45:54 - camp so
45:56 - i wouldn't be doing this stream here if
45:57 - it weren't for quincy
45:59 - and uh so i always appreciate when
46:02 - quincy stops in it's always exciting
46:05 - and go ahead and follow quincy on on
46:07 - twitter if you want to find out
46:09 - everything that's going on with free
46:10 - code cam uh he's always
46:12 - always tweeting about all the different
46:14 - things they're doing so that's so much
46:16 - going on here free code camp now
46:18 - um you know we've had the forum for a
46:20 - long time
46:21 - we have the youtube we have two youtube
46:23 - channels now one for talks and one you
46:26 - know this channel that we're on
46:28 - and um
46:30 - have a medium publication with blogs of
46:33 - a podcast now
46:35 - the new beta curriculum is being worked
46:37 - on and is going to come out soon
46:40 - i'm probably missing some other things
46:42 - that we're doing but there's just so
46:43 - much with free code cam uh so if you if
46:47 - you haven't checked out the rest of what
46:49 - is there then
46:50 - you know please please check it out
46:52 - there's so much more
46:54 - and better stuff than than just what i'm
46:56 - doing here on the stream
47:02 - all right so
47:04 - one problem that we had before we
47:06 - stopped is that when we put more than
47:08 - one collapsible item in here
47:10 - right now the way we have it set up they
47:12 - both
47:14 - open and close the same time
47:16 - so we need to fix that but first we're
47:18 - going to clean some stuff up
47:20 - so we've extracted out
47:23 - all the the code we need to make one of
47:26 - these these elements click and
47:29 - everything below it included
47:32 - and we've extracted that out into its
47:33 - own component
47:36 - and
47:37 - we're not
47:38 - we don't have everything uh ready yet we
47:40 - see we still have some little red
47:41 - squiggly lines which means we have
47:43 - errors mainly these aren't defined
47:46 - so we need to define
47:52 - let's see
47:59 - a stylus theme
48:04 - i'm wondering if any of these had to do
48:06 - with your image form control nested
48:13 - i think nested
48:17 - yeah we need to pull the nested clasp
48:19 - but i don't think we'll need any of the
48:21 - other ones
48:25 - so let's bring this in now
48:28 - and then we'll remove what we don't need
48:42 - let's double check
48:47 - yeah that was the only place we were
48:49 - using classes
48:53 - and we need to bring in also
49:02 - dance classes
49:03 - we're open
49:16 - oops
49:17 - a new version of java is available i do
49:20 - not want java
49:22 - run me later
49:24 - why do i still have a java on my
49:25 - computer anyway
49:27 - anyway it popped up on my other screen
49:31 - um
49:39 - i think the open
49:40 - referred to the drawer yeah it did so we
49:43 - don't need open
49:44 - we don't need toggle drawer
49:46 - let's just bring in classes
49:49 - wonderful and style so all right so now
49:52 - we have everything that we need
49:56 - and we may be able to get rid of this
50:02 - let's get rid of this
50:05 - and see
50:10 - that's this in that list item
50:15 - all right great we can get rid of this
50:19 - this was just that
50:21 - that second one we brought in
50:36 - okay
50:37 - so that shortened up our component a
50:39 - little bit
50:45 - nice we may even pull this out at some
50:47 - point i'm okay with it there for now
50:52 - this is that
50:53 - search uh so this is our logo at the top
50:56 - and this is that search input
51:01 - so that's what we're talking about so
51:02 - you see everything below it now has been
51:04 - taken out
51:06 - so first let's just try to put this back
51:09 - in and see
51:11 - if it
51:12 - if it works oh no we didn't have
51:15 - we need this toggle drawer
51:27 - all right we will have to pass toggle
51:29 - drawer down
51:32 - so let's put that back in here
51:37 - toggle drawer and
51:40 - what we call the other one
51:47 - right now it's handle click but we don't
51:49 - want it to be called handle click right
51:50 - we want it to be
51:54 - open
51:56 - item
52:04 - all right yeah we're going to call it
52:06 - open item
52:34 - all right so we have
52:36 - our handle click is now going to be
52:43 - actually our handle click is going to
52:44 - get passed down as a prop from our
52:46 - layout
52:47 - right i'm you know i'm going to check
52:49 - the live chat so i i
52:52 - if you have any questions put them in
52:53 - the live chat i'm going to do a better
52:55 - job of checking back in there to make
52:57 - sure that i'm not losing you feel free
53:00 - to ask questions i'm just gonna really
53:04 - quickly scan through
53:05 - the last few comments
53:16 - turn
53:28 - okay rook says uh that handle click
53:31 - function please change that set state
53:33 - call to the function version
53:42 - uh okay so rooker we're talking about
53:46 - this handle click
53:51 - just to be sure if it's this one uh just
53:54 - let me know that i have the right one
53:56 - this this may be the only one that we've
53:58 - seen
54:00 - but we're actually going to take this
54:02 - out completely from here
54:05 - and we're going to move it up to layout
54:09 - let me grab that we may have done it did
54:11 - we do it already
54:14 - i think we did
54:17 - x
54:18 - expand menu
54:20 - is that what we did
54:22 - we did i went over here and i called it
54:24 - expand menu
54:46 - all right so rook is saying
54:49 - there's a
54:51 - recommended way to update the state
54:53 - based on previous state
54:55 - and so let's
54:58 - let's do that
55:02 - let's set states
55:06 - let's do that here
55:09 - just to show um
55:11 - if you can't see the live chat now
55:13 - i'll kind of type it out for you
55:16 - so
55:17 - this is our previous state
55:22 - and
55:24 - so we can
55:26 - we're going to pass in our previous
55:28 - state
55:31 - and
55:33 - we can
55:35 - update our object so then we would put
55:38 - what open
55:44 - let's see if we've called previously
55:46 - this parameter you can say so our open
55:48 - items is going to be
56:04 - this would be the same name
56:12 - so we do it like this open items equals
56:32 - would need to be something like this
56:35 - and rook's explaining
56:39 - this avoids issues with set state being
56:42 - asynchronous and batching
56:45 - set state calls by default
56:50 - okay great
56:52 - open item preview save on all right
56:54 - awesome so this was uh
56:56 - the correct yeah this is the correct way
56:59 - thanks rook
57:00 - uh i appreciate
57:02 - i appreciate you pointing that out
57:04 - that's cool yeah i um
57:08 - i knew that we could get the previous
57:10 - state i'd never used it before
57:12 - i didn't realize that there was
57:14 - a better performance with this
57:17 - so i'm glad i'll try to keep this in
57:19 - mind and use it it'll probably take me a
57:20 - while before i'm used to this way
57:23 - but i will try to use it
57:26 - uh would it would this way be the best
57:28 - way just by default
57:30 - oh no what did i do
57:33 - would this be the best way by default
57:35 - or should i stick with kind of the
57:37 - normal way unless i
57:41 - i was already using it up here
57:43 - i i probably didn't write this uh one of
57:45 - you probably wrote this and
57:47 - i just merged the pull request but
57:50 - i didn't realize i was already using it
57:54 - uh also i don't need these parens
57:57 - parentheses here
58:10 - same thing just avoids issues when you
58:12 - change database on previous date okay
58:14 - cool
58:15 - um so i will
58:18 - do my best to learn this way and keep
58:20 - using it
58:23 - all right so
58:24 - let me say this expand menu
58:30 - you know what i want to say expand item
58:34 - i think i like that better
58:40 - because really it's a menu item it
58:42 - happens to have a sub menu inside it but
58:46 - i think i like item better since we're
58:48 - calling this a drawer item
58:51 - all right x
58:53 - expand
58:55 - expand item
59:12 - um
59:34 - let's see
59:46 - oh okay rook says you also get access to
59:48 - props in that function as a second
59:50 - argument uh it's not used in a handler
59:52 - right now all right cool that's useful
59:59 - all right so right now
60:02 - the expanding
60:05 - uh and collapsing is was handled
60:09 - in our drawer
60:11 - by
60:12 - state
60:12 - we had open items
60:15 - so what we're going to do now is
60:18 - all right let's do it like this
60:21 - state
60:23 - equals
60:29 - open items
60:33 - why is that defaulted to true
60:44 - you think you'd want it to be defaulted
60:46 - to false right
60:48 - i wanted false
60:51 - maybe just for an example we had it
60:52 - defaulted to true all right so i'm going
60:54 - to put that in here
60:56 - but then
60:58 - i'm going to do a um
61:10 - yeah
61:11 - that's how we'll do it
61:17 - wait a second
61:37 - i just confused myself okay
61:41 - let me explain what i was what i'm
61:43 - thinking here why just confuse myself
61:47 - so our problem was we had both opening
61:49 - at the same time both items would open
61:52 - and close at the same time so my
61:54 - solution i was thinking is let's
61:56 - separate it out into another component
61:58 - let's handle state and that component
62:00 - and then each component
62:02 - each expandable menu would handle its
62:04 - own state and that would work but
62:07 - the problem is that we also need to be
62:09 - able to change the state of that item
62:11 - from another component
62:13 - it's going to be
62:16 - our our app bar component
62:21 - so that that was the issue
62:44 - so it's easy to do it in here if all the
62:46 - states internal the hard part is getting
62:48 - the click to work
62:56 - all right we'll take it one step at a
62:58 - time let's break it down first let's
63:00 - just get this to work
63:02 - we're going to pretend right now like we
63:04 - don't have to do the other step and
63:05 - that'll just simplify things we'll get
63:07 - it to work
63:08 - then we can go to step 2 and figure out
63:12 - how to
63:13 - change the state
63:15 - from outside this component
63:20 - all right so
63:22 - what we'll do then is
63:32 - drawer
63:45 - all right so for now we know we're not
63:46 - going to keep it in here but for now
63:48 - let's just put this in here just to make
63:50 - sure that
63:52 - uh we haven't messed anything up when we
63:55 - move this component over so we should
63:57 - save that that should work
64:00 - and then
64:07 - here we're going to
64:12 - add in
64:14 - let's see
64:16 - bringing in components oops
64:19 - yeah and drawer we are right
64:31 - sorry i'm thinking out loud a bit
64:35 - i've been working so much with the
64:37 - importing data and things i haven't
64:39 - actually worked with react components
64:41 - like this for
64:43 - for a while probably like definitely
64:45 - before before christmas
64:48 - all right so we're going to import
64:51 - drawer item
64:55 - and
64:56 - it's in the same folder
64:58 - so we just need to do
65:01 - dot slash
65:03 - drawer item
65:05 - and then down here we can add a few
65:10 - drawer items to the bottom of our list
65:16 - draw item
65:18 - oops
65:27 - all right so we'll add three of them in
65:28 - there
65:29 - so you save that save that
65:31 - and
65:32 - let's see
65:33 - oops
65:38 - i guess those colors are right
65:41 - i think my colors are a little off from
65:43 - what i used to use in my other editor
65:47 - so sometimes i think i have errors and i
65:49 - really don't
66:00 - all right let's see
66:02 - oops
66:04 - i didn't want to save this yet
66:08 - all right
66:12 - i gotta accidentally save that
66:18 - no
66:33 - all right cool
66:36 - all right so it still opens
66:41 - no
66:43 - all right so our clicks don't
66:44 - work all right i'm glad we um we tried
66:48 - this out
66:49 - first because
66:52 - we did something and the clicks don't
66:54 - even work
66:58 - all right so let's take a look
67:00 - at our drawer item
67:03 - so we do have a state the state's open
67:05 - items
67:08 - oops pretty state open
67:12 - items that's probably our problem
67:20 - no
67:23 - okay so i thought that was the problem
67:25 - because we
67:26 - were trying to change something in state
67:30 - this thing previously open items
67:32 - all right that looks fine
67:38 - let's try out
67:40 - expand item
67:48 - oh expand
67:50 - yeah expand item
67:55 - oh that's right we don't
67:57 - this isn't in props right now and then
68:03 - where's our on click
68:11 - yeah our on click should say this
68:18 - expand item
68:29 - all right so there we go now it works
68:32 - and since each component
68:34 - is handling its own state
68:38 - then they open
68:42 - independently
68:43 - awesome
68:44 - okay so that works uh the reason it
68:46 - didn't work
68:47 - at first was because
68:51 - one i wasn't even changing the right
68:54 - state i was
68:55 - i just had the word open here i didn't
68:57 - have open items so that was a problem
68:59 - and then also our on click
69:02 - was trying to call a function called
69:04 - handleclick which didn't even exist
69:07 - because we changed the name to expand
69:08 - item so those are the
69:10 - the two issues
69:15 - alright so now that that works
69:19 - let's take the next step
69:22 - and see if we can
69:25 - when we click one of these have this
69:27 - open and then have a change so i'd say
69:29 - the first step is
69:30 - let's just
69:32 - make it so that when we click one of
69:33 - these
69:34 - the drawer opens
69:36 - we'll try to do that we'll test that if
69:38 - that works then we'll move on and try to
69:40 - do this and we'll see how much time we
69:42 - have i want to commit this right now
69:45 - since we've kind of got to a point where
69:48 - things are stable and they work
69:50 - and it is an improvement over what we
69:52 - had we're not all the way there yet but
69:54 - i think this is a good point to commit
69:58 - um
70:00 - i'm going to do a git add
70:04 - so what i just did was i added any new
70:07 - files
70:08 - um
70:10 - and basically added any files
70:13 - uh
70:14 - to be ready to be committed and then i'm
70:16 - going to do git commit m which means
70:19 - just i'm going to put my commit message
70:21 - in that's what the m
70:22 - does
70:24 - and i'm going to say
70:27 - create
70:39 - create your item component
70:42 - that's pretty much what we did
70:44 - all right now it's going to run through
70:46 - all our tests so if you want to
70:48 - contribute to the project
70:51 - we got hit with these this is i'm glad
70:53 - this kind of hap this happened like this
70:55 - so if you want to contribute to the
70:56 - project when you go to commit
70:59 - which i encourage anyone who wants to
71:01 - contribute please do especially if you
71:02 - haven't contributed to a project before
71:04 - in github
71:05 - the projects we do on the stream i think
71:07 - are a great chance for you to just get
71:09 - started so i'm not going to get upset if
71:11 - you
71:12 - do a pull request and it's
71:14 - it doesn't work
71:16 - i'll try to help you through it if you
71:18 - have any questions let me know
71:20 - i've had
71:21 - a handful of people submit their first
71:24 - pull request
71:25 - on the things that we work on in the
71:27 - stream and i'm always really happy when
71:29 - that happens so if you want to submit a
71:31 - pr
71:32 - let me know if you need help i'm here to
71:34 - help you but if you do on pretty much
71:37 - all our projects we have some automated
71:39 - testing and linting and formatting
71:42 - so
71:43 - a lot of what you see here is is that
71:45 - going on
71:46 - but i messed up so it's not going to let
71:49 - me commit until i fix this
71:51 - so let's fix it and run it again and
71:54 - it's going to check everything and make
71:55 - sure i did it right
71:57 - this is kind of a good like safety net
72:00 - so that
72:01 - code that obviously doesn't work doesn't
72:04 - get into the project it makes it a
72:06 - little bit easier for me to review the
72:08 - pull requests because there's certain
72:10 - things i know are already going to be
72:12 - there and i don't have to check on
72:15 - so
72:16 - let's see where we're at so it tells us
72:18 - now it's eslint has found some errors so
72:20 - these are basically um
72:23 - like
72:24 - errors that break the rules of es land
72:26 - so obviously these errors haven't caused
72:29 - our application to crash
72:31 - but we don't want this kind of stuff in
72:33 - our code we want it cleaned up
72:35 - so we have some
72:37 - some things that we've defined but never
72:39 - used so we don't want to do that
72:42 - so let's find out where it's at
72:44 - they're all in this drawer.js component
72:47 - so we only have to look in one place
72:49 - which is good and it tells us exactly
72:51 - exactly where
72:52 - they all are
72:54 - so let's check it out line by line i'm
72:56 - going to shrink this a little bit so we
72:57 - can see
72:58 - this is our drawer.js component let's go
73:01 - up here and we have lines 6 seven eight
73:03 - and nine
73:05 - so on line six
73:07 - and it's actually highlighting it here
73:08 - in red
73:10 - so if i would have been more careful and
73:11 - checked before i tried to commit we
73:13 - would have seen it
73:14 - but let's get rid of that list item
73:16 - since we're not using it anymore
73:18 - and these are all things that we took
73:20 - out and moved over to this component
73:22 - that's why we don't need them anymore
73:25 - and now i'm just going to get rid of
73:27 - all these lines
73:30 - and
73:30 - save okay i can verify that everything's
73:34 - still working by going back to my
73:35 - project
73:38 - all right great it still works and now
73:41 - i don't have to type everything in again
73:43 - i'm just going to hit the up arrow key
73:44 - on my keyboard and it brings up that
73:47 - last message that git commit message
73:49 - this will save you a lot of time i was
73:51 - talking to somebody yesterday who didn't
73:53 - know about that on the command line and
73:55 - it's always great when you first learn
73:57 - about that
73:58 - and also the autocomplete
74:01 - like if you hit tab it auto completes
74:03 - when you first learn about that it like
74:05 - changes your world it was so cool to see
74:07 - somebody
74:08 - like learn that
74:10 - for the first time
74:12 - so i'm gonna hit enter again it's going
74:13 - to run through our tests
74:15 - let's make it a bit bigger
74:18 - there we go so
74:19 - i made it through
74:21 - prettier which auto formats i made it
74:23 - through eslint which that's what i got
74:25 - caught at the last time now it's
74:27 - actually running tests so it's opening
74:29 - up
74:30 - a browser it's loading the page and
74:32 - checking to make sure certain elements
74:34 - are actually on the page so you can't
74:36 - see it now the browser opened up on my
74:38 - other screen
74:40 - but it actually i just saw all these
74:42 - tabs open in the browser and different
74:44 - pages in the site load you don't have to
74:46 - have it open up uh there's some options
74:49 - you can run it so you don't see it
74:51 - but
74:52 - you can see it checked our faculty page
74:54 - we don't have tests for all our pages
74:56 - yet
74:57 - that's one of the areas where maybe i
74:59 - should make some issues in the github
75:01 - repo anybody that really wants to write
75:03 - the test feel free
75:05 - but we did test we tested three pages
75:08 - our faculty
75:09 - and it says uh
75:11 - this page can be seen at
75:14 - this ura faculty sum id
75:17 - so whatever id we want to test
75:19 - and it displays the correct data
75:22 - the index can be seen at the correct url
75:24 - which is the root
75:26 - and then page two can be seen at slash
75:28 - page
75:29 - right so
75:31 - we passed all our tests
75:34 - now we're ready to commit or ready to
75:36 - push this so we're going to get push
75:39 - origin
75:41 - and we could type in master here since
75:43 - we want to push it to the master branch
75:45 - but we don't have to we can just use the
75:46 - shorthand hit enter it'll automatically
75:49 - push to master i do need to put in my id
75:52 - since i restarted my computer earlier
75:55 - so let me
75:56 - on my other screen here i'm going to
75:57 - open up
75:59 - lastpass
76:00 - if you're not using a password manager
76:02 - like lastpass i do recommend it
76:05 - that way you can use super long
76:07 - ridiculous passwords and you don't have
76:09 - to remember them you have to remember
76:11 - one your super long ridiculous lastpass
76:13 - password
76:15 - but then
76:16 - all your other ones are covered
76:18 - hmm for some reason
76:23 - lastpass is not opening
76:31 - what did i do
76:36 - all right let me try to open in a
76:37 - different window
76:39 - no
76:51 - all right let me go to this
76:57 - last
77:12 - okay rook says you don't even have to
77:14 - use get push origin you can just use get
77:17 - push and that will work that's really
77:19 - cool i didn't know that
77:21 - um
77:22 - i'm gonna have to log into the desktop
77:24 - version of lastpass since my
77:26 - extension isn't working my chrome
77:28 - extension
77:31 - when i was shutting down clone chrome
77:33 - windows before uh from the task manager
77:36 - in chrome
77:38 - maybe i accidentally did something that
77:40 - messed up lastpass i don't know
77:43 - um
77:44 - actually
77:49 - maybe i just go to the chrome extensions
77:51 - page
77:54 - after i just gave this big uh
77:56 - deal on
77:59 - everybody used lastpass and now it
78:00 - doesn't work
78:20 - hmm
78:25 - i can open up the options for lastpass i
78:27 - just can't open last
78:47 - oh well
78:56 - uh harshit says are you in lastpass
78:57 - premium i am in lastpass premium i could
79:00 - just open it on my phone and type in the
79:02 - password i guess
79:05 - let me do that
79:06 - i was just trying to get out of typing
79:08 - in that big password but
79:11 - hello um
79:36 - all right
79:38 - let me type this in now
80:05 - all right that should work
80:07 - what
80:15 - no
80:17 - all right well let's try to just type
80:18 - get push
80:22 - let me try to type it again maybe i did
80:24 - it wrong
80:44 - yeah it worked this time
80:47 - awesome
80:50 - sorry for the uh the delay okay
80:53 - so
80:56 - that's that's there and that's push to
80:57 - get up so you all can see all the code
80:59 - that we just did you can check it out
81:00 - yourself
81:02 - you can clone the project
81:04 - contribute use it for whatever you want
81:08 - everything's totally
81:10 - open source
81:12 - we use the mit license you can do
81:14 - whatever you want
81:15 - uh i will say like the obviously the
81:18 - logo doesn't fall under that right
81:21 - that's the university's logo um and then
81:23 - like university images but
81:26 - the code itself is mit
81:30 - all right let me
81:31 - let me set my five minute timer i'm
81:33 - gonna go through some questions and then
81:35 - figure out whether or not we want to
81:36 - continue with this and try to get some
81:38 - more to work or maybe we want to save
81:40 - that for tomorrow's stream
81:43 - so if you have an opinion about that let
81:45 - me know
81:47 - i know
81:48 - it can be a long time to watch a stream
81:51 - we've been going for almost an hour and
81:53 - a half now
81:54 - so let me know if you'd rather have me
81:56 - split it up and do some today and some
81:57 - tomorrow or just do it all today
82:18 - uh let's see dinesh asks are you a react
82:22 - developer
82:24 - i guess so
82:25 - um
82:27 - i mean officially i'm a front end
82:29 - developer and i do a lot of react stuff
82:32 - so i think it would be accurate to say
82:34 - i'm a react developer
82:37 - if anyone disagrees with that let me
82:38 - know
82:39 - i'm not really sure what qualifies i'm
82:41 - going to be a react developer but i
82:43 - develop things with react
82:49 - all right john hanson says so i should
82:51 - mostly pass up with props in the
82:54 - functional uh dumb components
82:57 - uh if a component view container needs
83:01 - state to make it standalone component
83:03 - then let them hold their own functions
83:07 - um let me read that again
83:11 - that's props
83:15 - yeah so your your stateless functional
83:17 - components definitely just do props
83:20 - right they're not going to have state
83:32 - yeah so if you need a
83:36 - if you need something to have its own
83:38 - state you can put the functions in there
83:40 - like we did with these list items all
83:42 - right now obviously
83:43 - either later today or tomorrow we're
83:45 - gonna have to deal with the other things
83:46 - that we wanted to do
83:48 - and it may need to change but for now
83:50 - that was the simplest way to get the
83:52 - behavior that we wanted that each
83:54 - component handles its own state
83:58 - john hanson says jesse is a react king
84:02 - i don't know about that
84:04 - uh i'd be happy if i was like
84:07 - i don't know a react duke what are all
84:10 - the titles of royalty right maybe i'm
84:12 - down a little lower
84:14 - um
84:16 - dinesh says
84:18 - as i can
84:20 - see on both the screens you might be
84:22 - working on html and some js framework is
84:26 - that correct which framework is of
84:28 - javascript is it uh it is react so we
84:31 - are using react
84:36 - all right
84:51 - all right let me uh so quincy was in the
84:53 - chat a little while ago and uh quincy
84:55 - did say we're just getting started
84:56 - exciting things in the pipes for
84:59 - 2018. so that's cool i'm excited to see
85:03 - what what happens
85:05 - so i'm not in the loop with all the
85:06 - secret free code camp new stuff coming
85:09 - out so i'm just as excited as any of you
85:11 - might be
85:13 - um
85:14 - let's see
85:18 - let's see
85:24 - let me know if i mispronounced that but
85:26 - anyway they say hey i was making a
85:28 - twitter clone with react.js and material
85:31 - you lie but i couldn't get the twitter's
85:34 - navigation icons like home icon etc how
85:38 - do i get those icons
85:40 - hmm
85:45 - with an ad like
85:47 - icon is like for twitter no
85:50 - i accidentally closed out my
85:53 - my youtube window
86:17 - so i always wondered if my stream would
86:18 - still work if i closed out of youtube
86:22 - and it looks like it did still work
86:27 - let me know did the stream stop at all
86:30 - like a few seconds ago
86:47 - see
86:57 - all right i'm trying to look at the the
86:58 - bottom of the live chat and see if it
87:01 - stops
87:10 - all right cool
87:11 - that was really weird uh so i
87:13 - accidentally closed the tab and now it
87:15 - says that it looks like my stream has
87:17 - restarted
87:18 - from my
87:20 - admin screen
87:23 - because it's saying i've only been
87:24 - streaming for one minute
87:26 - but based on what you are telling me i
87:29 - guess it didn't stop at all
87:31 - i'm just worried because i don't want
87:32 - there to be two videos
87:35 - of this this stream later on
87:38 - uh so as long as that doesn't happen i
87:39 - think it's it's okay uh so anyway the
87:42 - question was about the icons for twitter
87:45 - so the reason i accidentally closed my
87:46 - windows because i was going to open a
87:47 - new tab and look at the twitter icons
87:50 - so i could better answer the question
87:52 - and i accidentally closed out
87:55 - youtube
87:57 - um
87:58 - i don't know where you would get the
88:00 - icons for twitter
88:02 - they may not be available for public use
88:05 - so i would just be careful about that
88:07 - uh you could certainly get some icons
88:10 - that would
88:11 - do that like you have a there's a home
88:12 - icon right you could probably find a
88:15 - little icon of a house somewhere it
88:17 - might not be exactly what's on twitter
88:19 - but i would just be careful
88:21 - to find out if you're allowed to use the
88:23 - twitter icons or not
88:26 - and i mean you may be able
88:31 - i don't know if you'd be able to check
88:33 - in the code if they would
88:35 - have a comment somewhere in there or
88:36 - even
88:39 - i don't know if these are svgs or what
88:45 - i just
88:46 - just opened devtools to see
88:51 - oh it looks like a font icon
88:57 - all right so
88:58 - twitter's using i guess their own font
89:00 - icon set for that
89:04 - so maybe do a search for twitter font
89:06 - icons
89:12 - all right
89:13 - um
89:15 - my time's up i'm just i'm going to go
89:17 - down through
89:19 - how about we'll do this i'm going to go
89:20 - down through i'm going to answer all the
89:21 - questions and everything once we get to
89:23 - the end
89:24 - i'm gonna see how i feel how tired i am
89:27 - streaming takes a lot out of you um it
89:30 - really realistically i'm just sitting
89:32 - here talking and typing but like
89:34 - mentally
89:35 - it's draining to try to focus on the
89:38 - code and the live chat and talk
89:40 - so i might not be up for doing more code
89:43 - after this but there's a lot in the live
89:44 - chat so i want to make sure i get to all
89:46 - your questions we can always finish what
89:48 - we're doing here tomorrow
89:54 - let me check
90:06 - all right stephen says uh jesse just a
90:09 - quick question having a hard time
90:10 - learning javascript any ideas on what i
90:12 - should do i get the concepts just not
90:14 - how to use it
90:16 - um maybe
90:18 - if you need a little help about how to
90:19 - use it maybe check out some
90:22 - like practical projects that use it
90:25 - maybe where they walk you through some
90:27 - of it
90:28 - so
90:29 - maybe like a video where it walks
90:31 - through making a or an actual project
90:33 - would be good
90:35 - and then
90:37 - maybe you could go along with the video
90:39 - like type things out along with the
90:40 - video
90:42 - or
90:43 - you know then go from watching the video
90:45 - to trying to do it on your own in your
90:47 - own way something like that might help
90:49 - you make the connection between
90:51 - you know being able to do like some of
90:53 - the algorithm challenges to actually
90:55 - being able to build things on your own
90:57 - so i know there are some videos
91:00 - on this channel
91:02 - i know beau has some videos and some
91:04 - other people have videos on actually
91:06 - making projects step by step uh that use
91:09 - javascript
91:11 - so maybe try one out
91:13 - some of them might be too advanced so
91:15 - just you know try a few of them out and
91:17 - see what you can do with it
91:20 - i that's probably the best way uh to do
91:23 - things right i think that's like natural
91:25 - learning for people
91:27 - even when we're little we learn by
91:29 - watching other people doing things and
91:30 - then we try it out ourselves so
91:33 - i think that's that's
91:35 - everybody's different but that might be
91:37 - a more natural way is to watch somebody
91:39 - else do it and then try it out as you
91:42 - get confident then you can do your thing
91:45 - and and be more creative with it
91:49 - so anyway i hope that advice works
91:51 - steven uh try it out if it doesn't you
91:54 - know come on back ask me again maybe
91:56 - something specific i could help you out
91:58 - with
91:58 - if if you need it
92:08 - let's see
92:15 - savage
92:17 - savage banana said pics of life or riot
92:21 - i said earlier
92:24 - let's talk about my wife earlier in the
92:26 - stream so
92:27 - um
92:31 - it wouldn't be that hard to figure out
92:32 - who my wife is um
92:35 - we uh follow each other and like each
92:38 - other's stuff on twitter and instagram
92:40 - and facebook
92:42 - so um
92:45 - if you really wanted to figure out who
92:46 - my wife is and find pictures you could
92:48 - find it i'm not going to share them with
92:50 - you but
92:51 - it's not like it's it's a secret
93:01 - let's see
93:08 - uh rick says catch you later have a
93:10 - meeting uh see you rick thanks for
93:12 - joining us good luck with your meeting
93:22 - oh okay we have a little bit more
93:23 - context on stephen's question earlier so
93:26 - um steven's working on the
93:29 - wikipedia viewer in the free code camp
93:32 - challenges and um just
93:35 - not getting it all to work together the
93:37 - right way
93:40 - um
93:42 - great and angel had an idea of um maybe
93:45 - ask someone in the free code camp
93:47 - community to do some peer programming it
93:50 - could help i i think that's a great idea
93:52 - that's even better than watching a video
93:55 - uh if you really need some some help you
93:57 - know one-on-one help
94:00 - i'm sure there's a there's some videos
94:02 - out there people actually building the
94:03 - wikipedia viewer
94:05 - i always have mixed feelings about that
94:07 - when i go through
94:08 - the free code camp challenges or
94:10 - anything like that i always like to try
94:13 - to do it on my own before i look at how
94:16 - anyone else did it uh especially i don't
94:19 - mind as much looking at the ui but
94:21 - looking at the code
94:23 - i'd rather not do it
94:26 - i suppose if i'm stuck on the same
94:28 - problem for a really long time it makes
94:30 - more sense to just look at how someone
94:32 - else did it but
94:35 - but having somebody else there with you
94:37 - to just help when you need it i think
94:39 - would be preferable
94:48 - um someone asked about my code editor it
94:51 - is visual studio code
94:55 - oh i do want to share some good news i
94:56 - don't know if this person wants this
94:58 - announced so i'm not going to say a name
95:00 - but somebody who frequently is in the
95:02 - live chat
95:04 - for these streams
95:05 - just got a developer job
95:07 - uh and told me about it
95:10 - within the last few days
95:12 - so really excited about that uh
95:15 - congratulations you know who you are
95:18 - uh if you're cool with me saying your
95:20 - name just let me know
95:21 - uh but anyway really excited that has
95:24 - happened you know several times now
95:26 - where you know someone who's watched the
95:27 - live chat
95:29 - uh was able to get a job
95:32 - it's always really cool when that
95:33 - happens so any good news like that you
95:36 - know if if you
95:37 - if you're comfortable sharing i'd love
95:39 - to hear about it as i get really excited
95:42 - about about stuff like that
95:44 - i think it's cool when like we all
95:47 - develop in our coding and you know our
95:49 - careers develop
95:51 - so
95:53 - anyway again congratulations just
95:55 - thought i'd share that with you all
95:58 - you know a little little inspiration if
95:59 - you are looking for a job now
96:02 - people are getting jobs i'm not saying
96:05 - that it has anything to do with my
96:06 - stream it'd be cool if it did but
96:10 - probably not
96:12 - but
96:12 - people are getting hired it happens
96:15 - keep at it and
96:17 - if you're looking for a job it'll happen
96:19 - just keep keep trying
96:27 - is
96:43 - uh stephen says do so how much
96:45 - javascript do i need to know before i
96:47 - should move to react my ultimate
96:50 - goal is to jump into react
96:54 - uh
96:55 - let's see
96:59 - and
97:00 - in response john says i went from jquery
97:03 - to javascript in about three months i'm
97:06 - doing fairly well with react after four
97:08 - months time
97:09 - yeah i would say
97:13 - i've heard people say that you should
97:16 - get really good with javascript before
97:18 - you go to react and i respectfully
97:21 - disagree with that opinion
97:23 - i think
97:24 - once you know enough javascript to
97:26 - understand the basics of react you're
97:28 - okay to go and do react
97:31 - you will get better with javascript as
97:33 - you do react you'll use different parts
97:35 - of javascript that you never use before
97:37 - when you do react
97:39 - the only thing i would warn against is
97:41 - don't just do react and forget about the
97:43 - rest of javascript actively try to learn
97:46 - more javascript because one day
97:49 - no one will use react
97:51 - probably not going to be anytime soon
97:53 - but at some point your career there'll
97:54 - probably be some other thing
97:56 - and it'll be a lot easier for you to go
97:58 - from react to the other thing
98:01 - assuming the other thing's javascript
98:02 - based which probably will be
98:05 - but it'll be a lot easier for you to go
98:07 - from react to the other thing if you
98:09 - have a good foundation in javascript
98:11 - so
98:13 - just to sum up my advice is
98:15 - go for react as soon as you can start
98:17 - understanding it
98:18 - but keep up your learning of vanilla
98:20 - javascript along the way
98:24 - all right let's see john hanson says
98:26 - awesome jesse a good example of
98:28 - troubleshooting and react thinking
98:30 - ah thanks i appreciate it i felt like
98:35 - i felt like i was in trouble there for a
98:37 - little bit
98:38 - and
98:39 - i kind of looked over and saw how many
98:41 - people are watching it's like ah
98:43 - all these people are gonna think i don't
98:44 - know what i'm doing
98:48 - but that's kind of the draw of the
98:49 - stream right uh to see me struggle
98:52 - through
98:54 - but i was rusty i felt really rusty
98:56 - doing react stuff i was just forgetting
98:58 - like simple things so
99:00 - that long like winter break just
99:03 - uh i i guess i forgot a lot more than i
99:06 - thought i did
99:08 - but that through it we did it helped
99:10 - once i try to break it up into smaller
99:12 - steps
99:14 - so that's
99:15 - good a good tip break things up into
99:17 - small steps one at a time
99:20 - you'll have
99:22 - logical places to do a commit and break
99:26 - it up
99:27 - and
99:29 - you feel less overwhelmed
99:35 - uh
99:38 - miss
99:40 - miss alex says i didn't understand
99:44 - um i'm not sure what you didn't
99:46 - understand if you're still watching
99:48 - could you let me know
99:50 - like more specifics about what you
99:51 - didn't understand i'd be happy to go
99:53 - back and explain something
99:55 - or you know go through a part of the
99:57 - code or anything you need
100:09 - uh rook says those error messages are
100:11 - nice they tell you the file the line and
100:13 - the character spot the column yeah for
100:16 - sure they're they're really nice saves a
100:19 - lot of time rook says is that link
100:21 - clickable the error link let's see
100:25 - uh
100:26 - where's this
100:28 - checker terminal
100:36 - so these aren't clickable but maybe
100:37 - you're talking about the error that
100:39 - comes up here
100:41 - let's try let me do something
100:43 - [Music]
100:45 - that gives me an airline
100:49 - i can't click on that pop-up
100:52 - maybe
100:56 - let me try to do
101:03 - do something like this
101:13 - all right it doesn't look like anything
101:15 - in here is clickable
101:18 - whoa
101:20 - oh that was the get i've never typed
101:23 - clicked on the the get thing all right
101:25 - i'm just going to get out of there
101:26 - because
101:28 - it's confusing me
101:30 - um
101:32 - change 101 let's get out of here
101:34 - it was just showing me the changes that
101:36 - i made all right cool
101:40 - anyway rook
101:41 - i don't know if i was trying to click
101:42 - the right thing but it didn't look like
101:44 - any of that stuff was was clickable
101:53 - you know what all this calculating stuff
101:56 - is not working right i wonder if
101:59 - some of my plugins in visual studio code
102:01 - are what's causing my computer
102:06 - to run
102:09 - maybe
102:13 - this plug-in is cool but i really don't
102:15 - need it maybe i should go in and shut
102:17 - off some of the stuff i don't really use
102:22 - all right i'll have to check on that
102:25 - just a thought
102:33 - so harsh it said
102:35 - yeah rook that's amazing so it is
102:37 - clickable i must have just been trying
102:38 - to click the wrong thing then huh
102:48 - uh
102:59 - how to get the terminal on visual studio
103:01 - code to look like in the video
103:04 - you know what
103:05 - i got these colors from udacity's
103:09 - intro to get in github
103:11 - course it's a free course check it out
103:14 - um
103:15 - i think they have two get courses now
103:18 - the older one was taught by two women
103:21 - so do that one if you want to know these
103:23 - colors
103:24 - and they gave some an example
103:27 - file to change all your colors for your
103:29 - terminal
103:30 - and i just took the example i didn't
103:31 - even really change it i just like the
103:33 - colors
103:34 - so that's where i got it from
103:36 - the git and github
103:39 - areas i think it's called intro to get
103:40 - in github
103:41 - on udacity it's one of their free
103:44 - courses
103:58 - so earlier i was talking about tests and
104:01 - writing tests for this and harshit says
104:03 - jesse you also haven't written a test
104:06 - yet with a little winking smiley face
104:09 - oh [ __ ] you are right
104:13 - oh man i just got called out
104:16 - yeah i have not written a test yet i i
104:18 - will say this i have slightly modified
104:21 - some existing tests
104:23 - not for this project but for previous
104:26 - ones
104:27 - but i haven't written one a test on my
104:29 - own so
104:31 - horseshit keeps me honest
104:33 - i didn't i didn't say i wrote a test i
104:36 - just encouraged everyone to write tests
104:41 - yeah so i need to learn more about
104:43 - writing tests myself
104:47 - and uh yeah harshit has i've done all
104:49 - the tests for this project so thank you
104:51 - for that
105:11 - okay oh um
105:13 - i guess so we used get push earlier that
105:15 - only works if you have set the tracking
105:18 - branch already
105:20 - so thanks uh harshit and angel for
105:24 - clarifying that
105:36 - my phone got the oreo update i hate
105:38 - these new emoji
105:44 - i don't remember what the emoji were
105:45 - like was like before the oreo update
105:49 - maybe that's better
105:52 - uh
105:53 - then i won't be bothered by the new ones
106:20 - uh all right so um
106:22 - o o u s s uh os
106:26 - let me know if i'm pronouncing that
106:28 - wrong i'm not really sure how to
106:29 - pronounce that but anyway
106:30 - they say can i tell you something i
106:32 - subscribe to your channel but i never
106:33 - watch your videos this is mainly because
106:35 - they look too advanced
106:38 - uh and the thumbnails do
106:40 - and uh miss a lot of fundamental stuff
106:42 - in my opinion
106:45 - um
106:47 - uh when i watch some of your tutorials
106:49 - uh you go too fast but i still watch
106:51 - some of your videos though i'm not
106:53 - really hating on your channel i respect
106:54 - what you do alright cool i appreciate um
106:57 - the constructive criticism uh yeah so
107:02 - i will say this
107:04 - if if i ever go too fast you're welcome
107:06 - to ask some questions ask me to go back
107:09 - i'm i'm happy to do that
107:10 - but also
107:12 - so the different videos on this channel
107:14 - on free code camp channel serve
107:16 - different purposes
107:17 - if you maybe want a more fundamental
107:19 - tutorial check out some of bose
107:22 - javascript videos
107:24 - i mean it depends on what you want to
107:25 - learn but for instance beau has a lot of
107:28 - basic level javascript all the way up to
107:30 - more advanced stuff
107:32 - this particular series live coding with
107:35 - jesse is not really a tutorial it's more
107:38 - of just showcasing my everyday work so i
107:41 - think the biggest benefit to this aside
107:43 - from the awesome community that we now
107:45 - have you know around this the show is
107:49 - that i mess things up frequently
107:52 - and then we get to work through them
107:54 - live so you kind of get an idea that
107:56 - usually in tutorials you don't have that
107:58 - happen they're well organized and things
108:00 - work
108:01 - whereas with this stream things don't
108:03 - work
108:04 - and we have to work at them often or
108:07 - sometimes we just have to make things
108:08 - work and it's like this is as good as
108:10 - it's going to get right now when we have
108:12 - to
108:13 - you know think of the trade-offs between
108:16 - doing it one way or another
108:18 - so not everything is perfect
108:20 - so
108:22 - that's it it makes sense that sometimes
108:25 - it seems like it goes too fast or we
108:27 - miss you know go skip over fundamental
108:29 - things
108:32 - uh so
108:33 - i still appreciate you saying that and
108:35 - like i said
108:36 - if you ever want me to explain anything
108:38 - more
108:39 - or go back and do something again let me
108:42 - know i'm happy to do that
108:44 - uh but again i i really appreciate you
108:46 - saying that and the way you said it was
108:48 - very respectful i
108:50 - i definitely appreciate that uh so thank
108:52 - you
109:01 - kamal says
109:03 - uh hey jesse you're doing great work
109:05 - please organize this tutorial in an
109:06 - organized manner react part and material
109:09 - ui part uh would be a great help
109:17 - um
109:20 - kamal says i mean make the react and
109:22 - material ui part uh combined playlist in
109:25 - an organized way
109:26 - uh okay um
109:31 - yeah let me
109:36 - i can probably separate out the
109:37 - tutorials in a better way
109:40 - right now
109:41 - i have like i say what project it's from
109:44 - so the title will say like this this one
109:46 - i think was
109:48 - p5d23 so it's project five day 23.
109:51 - what i will do
109:53 - and i know i've been saying i'm gonna do
109:54 - this and i just haven't really taken the
109:56 - time to is go through and separate every
109:58 - project out into its own playlist
110:01 - i hadn't thought about doing anything
110:02 - like this before but it's a possibility
110:05 - that potentially i could separate out
110:07 - certain topics into their own playlists
110:10 - as well
110:11 - i don't know
110:12 - that might be more confusing but i could
110:14 - do something like
110:16 - here's where we do just all back end
110:18 - stuff here's where we everything where i
110:21 - handle like
110:22 - sending emails from a server or file
110:25 - uploads so there are some things that we
110:27 - seem to be doing like every project
110:31 - that could be i don't know let me know
110:33 - what
110:34 - what do you think would be the best way
110:35 - to organize these i'm still going to
110:36 - have the one big playlist that's just
110:38 - live coding with jesse so you can see
110:40 - everything in one spot
110:42 - but i definitely think it would be good
110:43 - to have playlists for each project is
110:46 - there any other way that i should try to
110:48 - organize these as well
110:50 - i pro i can't go crazy with it because
110:51 - it's not my channel i share it so i
110:53 - don't want to make a million playlists
110:55 - but
110:56 - you know if there's any reasonable way
110:57 - to organize it i'm i'm definitely um
111:01 - open to suggestions
111:17 - okay
111:41 - all right blake's here hey blake how's
111:42 - it going
111:52 - oh okay so kamal said please make a
111:55 - playlist for react.js material ui
111:57 - combined i don't know where to start
111:59 - it's all messed up uh wordpress react
112:02 - node i want react.js only please make a
112:05 - specific playlist for that
112:07 - hmm
112:09 - all right yeah i'll have to think about
112:11 - how to do that
112:13 - because there are times when we switch
112:15 - back and forth so it may be a little bit
112:17 - hard to just isolate
112:19 - react because there are some streams
112:21 - where we'll do node react wordpress all
112:24 - of it in one stream
112:27 - uh sometimes it's hard to just stick to
112:29 - one one thing
112:32 - i'll keep that in mind and i'll i'll try
112:34 - to think about how i could organize them
112:36 - there are definitely some videos that
112:38 - are like obviously one thing or the
112:40 - other
112:41 - they could maybe go into a playlist
112:56 - john hanson says a pinch of clothes is
112:58 - great when making a slow cook stew yum
113:01 - i don't know where that
113:03 - i guess are you cooking john i don't
113:06 - maybe i missed something in the chat
113:09 - um
113:12 - oh says did i did he answer my question
113:14 - i was gone for a second i did answer
113:16 - your question
113:18 - i'm not sure you can always check the
113:20 - recording
113:25 - uh let's see
113:34 - oh umberto says i found out recently
113:36 - that our contract is getting renewed
113:38 - i have no idea for how long yet but
113:40 - hopefully that means i get to keep my
113:42 - job for a while longer umberto that's
113:44 - awesome
113:45 - really awesome
113:47 - um
113:50 - yeah so i mean i guess
113:53 - let me know
113:54 - let me know if you do get to keep it and
113:56 - if you're back in the market looking for
113:58 - job let me know too uh i'd be happy to
114:00 - like
114:01 - i don't know retweet stuff for you help
114:04 - you get some exposure
114:09 - savage banana says becca yeah that's
114:13 - uh yeah my wife's name is becca so i
114:15 - guess you did go and look it up on
114:17 - social media
114:20 - um
114:28 - all right cool
114:31 - harshit says all right we might be on to
114:33 - something now harshit said that that
114:35 - import cost plug-in is cpu intensive uh
114:39 - and it crashed um
114:42 - it crashed his computer once so remove
114:44 - import cost
114:45 - all right cool
114:46 - so uh either today or tomorrow i'm gonna
114:49 - try to run on 1080p
114:52 - with that plug-in gone and then see if
114:55 - it makes a difference
115:04 - let's see
115:14 - hershey said i messed up pronunciation
115:16 - of kamal sorry about that let me know
115:18 - how i'm supposed to pronounce it
115:19 - properly
115:20 - uh i really i do care about pronouncing
115:23 - uh everyone's name right so
115:25 - uh let me know don't be afraid to
115:27 - correct me if i if i ever say your name
115:29 - wrong
115:43 - all right so uh oh says
115:46 - um i think kamal is right when you
115:49 - organize your projects in their own
115:50 - playlist it would be more attractive and
115:52 - more inviting
115:53 - uh the thing is i'm a software engineer
115:55 - and worked with javascript a lot
115:58 - with but with the new es6 and the new
116:00 - things like babel and import and export
116:03 - and how that stuff works uh like
116:06 - that freaks me out
116:07 - sometimes or the observed thingies
116:10 - it's not that i don't understand
116:11 - javascript just the new things that
116:13 - javascript frameworks offered
116:15 - but if you have videos or tutorials
116:18 - where you group them in playlist they
116:20 - would be so much better in my opinion
116:23 - so i work mainly with c sharp and php
116:26 - okay cool that's good that's good to
116:28 - know thanks for the clarification
116:30 - um yeah so
116:32 - i would say
116:34 - probably it would be more
116:36 - like i can still look at maybe
116:38 - organizing things differently but
116:41 - i would
116:42 - i would say trying to maybe find some
116:44 - specific videos maybe in like bose
116:47 - javascript playlist
116:49 - that have to do do with es6 and some of
116:52 - the newer things might be more helpful
116:53 - to you
116:54 - and then if you want to still watch the
116:56 - stream which is awesome if you do
116:59 - it will help you to understand more of
117:00 - it and i'm still open answering any
117:02 - questions that you have as well
117:08 - nikola says it's it's kind of hard to
117:11 - give a name to a live stream because you
117:13 - don't know exactly what you will finish
117:15 - at the end yeah for sure
117:18 - the hardest part about live streaming is
117:20 - figuring out what title to give the
117:21 - videos
117:22 - no lie that's the hardest part
117:25 - because you're right i just never know
117:27 - sometimes i title a stream and then i
117:30 - don't even get it to work at all or
117:33 - we end up having like some bug and we
117:35 - fix that so
117:38 - that is the hardest part
117:42 - even if i did organize them in the
117:44 - playlist i'd probably still have some
117:45 - things that weren't right
117:48 - because of that because sometimes we
117:50 - just don't actually do what the title
117:51 - says we do and then i never go back and
117:53 - change it which i should
117:58 - uh all says i study now as a software
118:01 - architect and
118:03 - my sequel
118:04 - database and stuff anyways yeah
118:07 - that was that was it i think one more
118:10 - thing my pronoun my name is pronounced
118:12 - like
118:13 - us
118:14 - okay cool
118:16 - thank you for the pronunciation i'll do
118:18 - my best to try to remember that us
118:20 - us
118:22 - okay
118:23 - awesome
118:24 - uh john says yes cooking painting and
118:27 - thinking code soon off to the gym
118:29 - wow that's impressive cooking painting
118:31 - and thinking about code
118:34 - that's that's really impressive i um
118:38 - uh
118:39 - i don't know if i can handle all that at
118:41 - once and still
118:42 - you know not burn the food
118:49 - all right harsh it says to paste and see
118:53 - the pronunciation and translate
118:55 - all right cool let me do that right now
119:23 - come on
119:30 - all right
119:32 - i'm trying
119:33 - i'm trying to listen and get it right
119:37 - it's really like subtle
119:52 - all right i don't know i'm trying my
119:54 - best to get it right i'm having trouble
119:55 - with that one though
119:59 - um
120:00 - let's see
120:09 - let's see
120:10 - harshad said uh
120:12 - to john hanson i looked at your website
120:14 - your oil paintings are awesome they are
120:16 - awesome uh check out john's website if
120:19 - you're into artwork uh he's a really
120:21 - good artist
120:23 - and if you still haven't checked out his
120:24 - light bright react app on codepen check
120:28 - that out as well
120:29 - i tweeted about it
120:31 - last week or something so check out my
120:33 - twitter and scroll down a bit and you'll
120:35 - see a link to it
120:38 - um
120:44 - says thank you for answering my
120:45 - questions jesse you're welcome thanks
120:47 - for watching the stream and being so
120:48 - active in the chat i really appreciate
120:51 - it
120:51 - all right so i've gotten to the end of
120:53 - the live chat and
120:55 - i tell you what
120:57 - i think i'm gonna wait till tomorrow to
120:58 - finish up with with what we're doing
121:01 - uh cause i'm a little bit tired i'd like
121:03 - i'd like a little break like to get
121:05 - something to eat
121:06 - and
121:07 - also
121:08 - now it gives me a good title for the
121:11 - stream tomorrow because i can use the
121:13 - same title and just put part two
121:16 - so that
121:18 - that makes it a lot easier for me
121:21 - um oh yeah one more question vivek says
121:24 - bro tell me how
121:26 - can i do my best in python
121:29 - uh well i don't know a lot about python
121:32 - specifically i do like python i've used
121:34 - it a little bit
121:36 - but i can give you some general advice
121:39 - on how to how to do your best
121:41 - and uh i should make a video about this
121:43 - because i think i've said this
121:45 - you know a few times now in the stream
121:48 - at different times but
121:51 - when you're trying to learn any coding
121:52 - stuff
121:53 - python included
121:55 - uh when you your strategy for for
121:57 - learning more i think should be
122:00 - if you can break it up and learn a
122:02 - little bit every day
122:03 - that's so much better than maybe like
122:06 - let's say every saturday just doing all
122:08 - day on saturday
122:10 - your brain will when your brain's trying
122:12 - to learn something new it's trying to
122:13 - make these little pathways and
122:15 - connections right with with the neurons
122:17 - in your brain i'm not a scientist so if
122:20 - i'm not using the correct terms
122:23 - i mean it is what it is but
122:25 - uh
122:26 - the more you make pathways like think of
122:28 - um
122:29 - if you're taking a hike in the woods
122:31 - right
122:32 - if you walked over the grass every
122:34 - single day a little bit every day
122:37 - the the grass and everything would get
122:39 - beat down and there'd be a path
122:41 - if you only did it once a week it
122:43 - probably wouldn't wouldn't happen the
122:45 - grass would have enough time to grow up
122:47 - and so you wouldn't have that nice path
122:49 - it's the same way with your brain
122:51 - so that will help if you can do a little
122:52 - bit every day if you can do a lot every
122:54 - day it'll help even more
122:56 - but that's my my number one piece of
122:58 - advice when you're trying to learn
123:00 - something you'll retain the knowledge so
123:02 - much better and try to build on it right
123:04 - so when you learn one thing
123:06 - don't just move on to another concept
123:08 - and never use it again try to
123:10 - immediately apply what you learned to a
123:12 - project
123:14 - so do your tutorials but then try to
123:16 - have a project going at the same time
123:17 - and apply it that helps so much when i
123:20 - was learning react with udacity
123:23 - i would immediately use what i learned
123:25 - in udacity
123:26 - on my projects at work and the stuff we
123:28 - did in the stream
123:30 - and so i remembered it so much better so
123:32 - then when i actually got to the point in
123:34 - the udacity course where i had to build
123:35 - my own project
123:37 - i had retained a lot of the knowledge
123:39 - from the lectures and and the little
123:42 - exercises that we had done along the way
123:44 - because i'd already used it
123:46 - so
123:47 - that's just kind of my general advice
123:51 - i think it can be applied safely to a
123:53 - lot of different things in programming
123:56 - and probably to other fields as well
124:00 - um
124:01 - i mean i don't know if if you have like
124:03 - any specific areas about python i don't
124:05 - know how much i can help because i
124:07 - i don't know that much about python
124:10 - [Applause]
124:12 - um harshit says here's some more
124:14 - specific advice this is good so harsh it
124:15 - says make servers or learn ai
124:18 - says there's a huge scope for python
124:21 - nikola says which time tomorrow will you
124:23 - stream uh in your time um
124:27 - i'm trying to stream
124:30 - i've been trying to stream earlier
124:31 - around noon it seems like a better time
124:33 - for um
124:35 - for time zones that are like
124:37 - in india and in
124:39 - that area of the world
124:41 - so
124:43 - maybe noon or one
124:45 - p.m eastern time in my time
124:50 - so sometimes i have things going on and
124:52 - i can't stick to a time
124:54 - but
124:55 - expect it sometime around there
125:01 - uh vivek says which field is more
125:03 - appropriate in the future ai or
125:04 - networking
125:06 - i don't know ai just it seems like it's
125:09 - really cool these days uh so harsha's
125:11 - answer is good says ai is really hot
125:13 - these days but there's always need of
125:15 - networking
125:17 - yeah
125:18 - yeah i mean i tend to agree it does
125:24 - i i think they'll both still be
125:26 - you know useful and around for a long
125:28 - time
125:28 - if i had to pick honestly
125:32 - assuming that i could safely get a job
125:34 - in either one and support my family i'd
125:36 - pick ai because that just seems
125:39 - it seems really cool to work on
125:44 - harshad also says you should be good at
125:46 - math and math for ai okay it's cool it's
125:48 - good to know
125:50 - that's some good specific advice there
125:55 - harshad also says networking is easier
125:57 - to learn
126:02 - uh abby schick says
126:04 - ionic or react native for android i
126:07 - recommend react native
126:09 - i think react native has some advantages
126:11 - over using ionic uh it lets you use like
126:15 - some more of like the lower level stuff
126:18 - um that you know
126:20 - won't necessarily have access to if
126:22 - you're using ionic now i haven't checked
126:24 - into ionic for years so maybe it's it's
126:28 - different now but as far as i know
126:30 - i think react native gives is is the
126:32 - better way to go
126:39 - uh vivek says what time do you stream in
126:42 - india
126:43 - um
126:44 - i don't know for sure there might be
126:46 - multiple time zones in india but
126:49 - for harsh it's time zone
126:51 - um
126:53 - which i need harsh it's in the himalayas
126:55 - but
126:56 - for that time zone
126:58 - noon would be like 11 p.m
127:01 - right
127:03 - let me know horizon uh is 12
127:06 - my 12 p.m my time 11 p.m for you
127:13 - it's somewhere around there it might not
127:15 - be exactly 11
127:16 - uh but i think it's that's close
127:22 - vivek says i'm stuck in many things so i
127:25 - can't decide my my future
127:28 - uh yeah that's tough vivek i mean right
127:30 - now just do what you can with what you
127:31 - have and don't worry about what you
127:33 - can't control you know
127:35 - um
127:37 - that way at least you can make progress
127:39 - with with what you do if it turns out
127:41 - you can end up doing more and have you
127:43 - know some more freedom in your decisions
127:45 - at some point then you'll be prepared
127:51 - uh
127:51 - [Music]
127:53 - let's see xavier says any way to
127:56 - contribute to your projects there used
127:58 - to be an option in free code camp to
127:59 - make websites for charities like for
128:01 - free
128:02 - um yeah i'm not sure how that works with
128:05 - the charities thing in free code camp
128:08 - but you can definitely contribute to
128:09 - these projects
128:12 - check out the repositories that we have
128:16 - and
128:17 - you know
128:18 - go to the link check out that whole
128:20 - github organization
128:22 - and any of the repositories just look at
128:25 - the
128:27 - uh look at the issues that are open and
128:30 - you can take one of those and work on it
128:31 - or if you notice some glaring flaw
128:34 - you can open your own issue and you'll
128:37 - work on that if you want
128:39 - if you need any help or ideas just just
128:41 - let me know
128:47 - oh cool good to know vivek says there's
128:49 - only one time zone in india it's gmt
128:53 - all right very good to know
129:01 - that's cool that's nice there's one time
129:02 - zone in the in the u.s we have so many
129:05 - time zones sometimes it's
129:07 - when you're traveling
129:09 - in within the country like it can be
129:11 - confusing um sometimes
129:15 - as you pass through time zones it's like
129:18 - depending on which way you're going it
129:20 - either seems like you gained a lot of
129:21 - time or you lost a lot of time
129:31 - um
129:32 - abby scheck says which library should be
129:34 - used for employing
129:36 - machine learning and web apps
129:39 - uh i i really don't know i don't know
129:41 - enough about that
129:44 - i know
129:45 - there is some uh machine learning
129:48 - javascript libraries out there
129:51 - i'll i don't remember offhand what
129:53 - they're called though uh but they do
129:55 - exist if you're gonna use them in web
129:56 - apps you may as well use javascript
130:00 - because you're going to be using it
130:01 - anyway since it's a web app
130:04 - so that would be my recommendation i
130:06 - don't know if you could run machine
130:07 - learning stuff client-side i assume
130:10 - you'd have to run it server side with
130:12 - node
130:13 - um
130:14 - i don't know it it would kind of be cool
130:16 - if there's a really something really
130:18 - lightweight that you could do basic
130:19 - machine learning stuff in the client but
130:21 - i i don't think that exists i think it's
130:23 - too resource intensive
130:40 - oh wow vivek says it's 1 15 a.m
130:44 - uh
130:45 - it is
130:46 - it is 2 46 p.m
130:49 - right now where i am
130:57 - abby
130:58 - asks is it advisable to learn two
131:00 - javascript frameworks at the same time
131:03 - um
131:05 - i wouldn't try to do it myself
131:08 - i'd rather focus on one and learn it
131:10 - really well the only way i would do that
131:12 - is if i um i wasn't sure whether i
131:14 - wanted to do one or the other and i just
131:16 - wanted to learn the basics of both to
131:18 - make a decision
131:20 - uh but i think it's better to choose
131:23 - i always i i think i mentioned this
131:24 - before in a stream but i i read it
131:26 - really like an old book once uh but it
131:29 - was about
131:32 - basically like ways to live your life to
131:34 - help like improve your brain um and your
131:37 - intellect and
131:40 - uh it was one of the things that it had
131:42 - said
131:43 - was was basically and this is in my own
131:45 - words
131:46 - was
131:47 - if you really want to be good at
131:49 - something you have to say no to
131:50 - everything else
131:52 - so
131:53 - right if you really want to be good at
131:55 - react you say no to angular and view if
131:58 - you really want to be you know and it
131:59 - works with anything in life not just
132:01 - programming it doesn't mean you can't do
132:03 - those other things but you can't do it
132:05 - at the same level right you have to
132:07 - focus there are some people who can be
132:09 - good at a lot of different things
132:12 - but if they would just pick one they
132:13 - could be great at it
132:15 - so if you want to really be great and
132:17 - like one of the best at something you're
132:19 - gonna have to pick other things
132:21 - um
132:22 - which is like
132:24 - i mean that that's kind of freeing and
132:26 - restrictive in the same time because it
132:29 - almost gives you license to be able to
132:31 - focus and you'll be okay with that um
132:34 - but but you do have to decide
132:37 - uh so i guess just think about that some
132:39 - people would may rather just be kind of
132:41 - good at a lot of things
132:43 - or even really good at a lot of things
132:45 - but to get to that best level you do
132:48 - have to choose and so that's why i would
132:51 - say
132:52 - learn one framework well
132:55 - and be really awesome at it
132:59 - that's what i would do
133:01 - but lisa it does depend a little bit on
133:03 - your goals and what your intention is
133:05 - for learning both of them
133:08 - all right i mean
133:09 - if you're in a a company that uses both
133:11 - obviously you have to learn both if
133:13 - you're a freelancer and you want to open
133:15 - yourself up to more clients yeah learn
133:17 - both but if you have the freedom to be
133:19 - able to pick one and stick with it
133:22 - i i would do that
133:30 - oh vivec says for machine learning
133:32 - tensorflow is good it's uh developed by
133:34 - google that's right yeah i
133:37 - i do remember hearing good things about
133:39 - tensorflow haven't used it yet but i've
133:41 - just heard good things
133:44 - uh hardship says javascript is terrible
133:46 - in machine learning use python
133:49 - it says 95 percent uses tensorflow
133:53 - hardship is making an ai chat bot
133:56 - vivec asks where i lived in america i
133:58 - live in ohio
133:59 - i actually live right on the border of
134:01 - ohio and pennsylvania and west virginia
134:04 - like they all meet at one place
134:06 - so i live the the big city that i'm
134:09 - closest to is pittsburgh
134:11 - so i'm pretty close to pittsburgh
134:14 - and
134:16 - so i'm in the eastern time zone so like
134:18 - new york city is in the same time zone
134:21 - that i'm in the whole east coast of the
134:22 - united states is in that time zone
134:31 - all right
134:33 - hey har [ __ ] harshest said stephenville
134:35 - ohio you remembered yes
134:37 - stephenville was a small city uh like i
134:41 - don't know like sixteen thousand people
134:43 - in steubenville i think
134:48 - vivek says uh ohio have their own
134:51 - university yeah so
134:52 - ohio has um
134:55 - a lot of universities so there's a
134:57 - university here in stephenville and
134:59 - that's what that's the university i work
135:01 - for it's uh franciscan university of
135:02 - steubenville there's a and it's so it's
135:05 - an independent
135:07 - school but there are state schools that
135:09 - are like government funded so ohio state
135:13 - is the big state school i believe it's
135:15 - the largest university in the state of
135:16 - ohio
135:18 - and then there's there's a lot of other
135:20 - small universities
135:25 - so
135:26 - small and there are some other state
135:28 - universities as well so there's there's
135:30 - a lot but
135:32 - [Music]
135:34 - ohio is one of the more important states
135:37 - in the united states
135:38 - uh several like major cities and things
135:43 - i'm not originally from ohio though i'm
135:45 - from west virginia which is one of the
135:46 - least important states
135:50 - but i i love it i love my home state
135:53 - um
135:54 - vivek says what job do you do i am a i'm
135:57 - officially a front end developer but
135:59 - realistically i i do a lot of back end
136:01 - stuff as well
136:04 - but my title is front and developer and
136:06 - if you'd like to know more about what i
136:07 - do just check out the stream because i'm
136:09 - streaming this from my job
136:12 - so this is my my actual work that i'm
136:14 - doing each day on the stream
136:18 - stuff you don't see are basically me
136:19 - sitting in meetings
136:21 - answering emails and uh sending messages
136:24 - on slack
136:26 - but like my real work is is exactly the
136:29 - same as what i stream
136:36 - let's see
136:38 - um
136:39 - here's another question and wow all
136:41 - right i'm gonna have trouble with this
136:42 - name i'm gonna do my best
136:44 - red jesh rajesh khannan
136:49 - really sorry if i messed that up um says
136:51 - how to improve my web design skill
136:54 - if you want to know more about design i
136:55 - recommend
136:56 - read through some the material design
136:59 - documentation just to get an idea of
137:01 - like the the logic behind design which
137:04 - you have to think about
137:06 - uh and then check out
137:07 - some other designs um so
137:12 - like there are websites that like give
137:14 - awards for the best website designs like
137:16 - check those out just kind of look at
137:19 - what's new and design things you like
137:21 - and don't like
137:22 - um and and then just try things out
137:27 - um
137:28 - you'll get a feel once you look at
137:30 - enough
137:32 - design and work with it enough you'll
137:33 - start to get a feel for what works and
137:35 - what doesn't just by looking at it
137:37 - you'll be able to look and say no those
137:39 - colors don't work i need more white
137:41 - space uh this needs to be a few pixels
137:43 - one way or the other like it takes a
137:46 - while to get that but eventually like
137:49 - you'll get it and i'm not saying i'm the
137:50 - best at design but you know i'm
137:52 - definitely at the point where i can look
137:54 - at something and say this will look
137:55 - better if it were adjusted a few pixels
137:57 - or those colors definitely don't work
138:00 - um
138:01 - and
138:02 - at that point and then you know even
138:04 - beyond i'm sure there are people that
138:06 - are even so much better at that and can
138:08 - come up with an awesome design like
138:10 - you know right off just off the top of
138:13 - their head on a piece of paper or
138:14 - something but that would be my advice
138:16 - just kind of check out the designs that
138:19 - are prominent now
138:21 - read about like why they do it and check
138:24 - out some of the websites that are really
138:26 - getting
138:28 - like recognized for having good design
138:40 - uh
138:40 - let's say
138:42 - yes
138:45 - abby six says how to make svg responsive
138:48 - and web pages
138:51 - um harshad said media queries yeah media
138:53 - queries so
138:55 - i'll tell you what check out some of the
138:57 - videos by sarah drazner
139:00 - um
139:02 - she's really good with svg's
139:04 - and
139:05 - so check out some of her stuff i've
139:07 - heard some of her talks before where she
139:09 - covers like responsiveness and svg's and
139:12 - it's actually a lot better to use svg's
139:15 - as opposed to normal images if you want
139:17 - things to look great on different
139:18 - screens because there's
139:21 - i don't know there's really cool stuff
139:22 - that you can do
139:25 - there's so much you can do with svg so i
139:27 - check out some of her stuff if you want
139:28 - to learn more about it but
139:30 - essentially yes like media queries work
139:32 - a lot using like percentage widths
139:36 - instead of
139:37 - um
139:39 - like a fixed width
139:41 - you know helps a lot
139:44 - uh but i think was sarah drazner yeah
139:46 - that's d-r-a-s-n-e-r
139:53 - uh vivek says bro you live in america
139:56 - it's great but i live in india it's also
139:58 - great but i want to get a job in google
140:00 - california
140:02 - yeah um
140:04 - it'd be great to work at google uh they
140:06 - have
140:07 - you make a lot of money there's um
140:10 - like a great a lot of like perks to
140:12 - working at google like you most likely
140:14 - have access to a lot of awesome
140:16 - technology
140:18 - they also have a lot of different
140:19 - locations worldwide as well so
140:22 - i mean it'd be cool to live in
140:23 - california i wouldn't want to live there
140:25 - though because it's really really
140:26 - expensive to try to find a house or an
140:28 - apartment in california but google does
140:30 - have other locations like they actually
140:33 - have a location in pittsburgh which
140:35 - would be really cool to work at i could
140:37 - i could live in the same house i live in
140:39 - now and just commute into pittsburgh and
140:41 - work at google there
140:43 - if they'll they'll have me if anybody
140:44 - from google is watching
140:47 - i mean
140:49 - give me a call
140:50 - maybe we'll see
140:54 - uh i like my job right now and where i'm
140:56 - at but i probably would not turn down
140:58 - something from google it's just a great
141:00 - opportunity
141:02 - um
141:03 - assuming i would even good enough to
141:04 - work there i don't know about that
141:08 - um
141:10 - let's see
141:17 - whoa
141:18 - uh all ozos just
141:21 - put a lyric up from country roads which
141:24 - is basically like the the theme song of
141:26 - my home state of west virginia
141:29 - so
141:30 - you you just made my heart feel like
141:34 - longing for my homeland right now just
141:36 - from that lyric so i'm gonna like be
141:39 - singing that song all day every true
141:41 - west virginian knows all the words to
141:43 - that song and can sing it whenever it
141:45 - comes on
141:47 - so
141:50 - how did you know about that
141:52 - song um
141:55 - well i really i appreciate that that's
141:57 - awesome you put that in there
142:00 - um
142:05 - let's see
142:21 - oh yeah so they're saying sarah drazner
142:23 - works at microsoft yeah yeah she works
142:26 - at microsoft she's really active on
142:28 - twitter as well uh you check out her
142:29 - twitter stuff she has she's spoken at a
142:32 - ton of different conferences so she's on
142:34 - a lot of different youtube channels
142:36 - for different things she i think she has
142:39 - a talk on free code camps talk channels
142:42 - so free codecam has two different
142:43 - channels if you check out their talk
142:45 - channel
142:46 - um
142:48 - then uh i think she's on there
142:53 - but yeah everything i've ever seen her
142:54 - do with svg's is just amazing
143:11 - i should say jesse they will probably
143:13 - not hire a react engineer
143:15 - as facebook yeah i don't
143:17 - i assume i'd be doing other things and
143:19 - and not react i don't does google use
143:21 - react for anything i don't know maybe
143:23 - they do
143:24 - um
143:26 - yeah so maybe i'd be doing other stuff
143:27 - but
143:28 - i mean they gotta have people writing
143:30 - javascript right they have a lot of
143:32 - websites so i'd probably be doing
143:33 - something with javascript
143:36 - i do use a lot of material design
143:39 - and google uh
143:41 - google invented that so
143:44 - maybe maybe there's a show for me
143:46 - um
143:49 - john hanson says it's for you google's
143:51 - calling yeah
143:54 - be crazy if they actually did call me
143:56 - during a stream at some point
143:59 - um
144:01 - all right
144:03 - i've gotten to the end of the live chat
144:05 - finally
144:06 - all right so i think i'm going to stop
144:07 - for real this time
144:10 - uh thanks everyone for watching
144:12 - uh we
144:16 - we did some good stuff
144:18 - uh didn't get everything done that i
144:20 - wanted to but
144:22 - um the work that we did it worked so
144:25 - that's that's a plus
144:27 - so i'll be back tomorrow i'm going to
144:29 - try to stream sometime around like noon
144:32 - or 1pm
144:34 - uh
144:36 - another question
144:37 - um
144:39 - says would you recommend for me to go to
144:41 - into app academy
144:44 - um
144:46 - i'm not sure exactly what app academy is
144:48 - but
144:49 - my recommendation for any type of thing
144:51 - like that or boot camp or something is
144:53 - check it out to make sure that they're
144:54 - legitimate and see like do people really
144:57 - get jobs from this
145:00 - check on the price if you can afford it
145:02 - and you can take the time and it seems
145:04 - like it's a reputable thing
145:06 - then go for it
145:08 - i've never done anything like that
145:11 - uh so i can't tell you personally but
145:13 - like my wife's doing a boot camp right
145:15 - now and she seems to be really happy
145:16 - with it so
145:19 - um without knowing more details that's
145:21 - just kind of my general advice
145:26 - uh
145:27 - all right so now
145:29 - let me get out of here i'm really hungry
145:31 - at this point so i actually do want to
145:33 - end the stream
145:34 - uh and get something to eat so
145:38 - thanks so much everyone for watching
145:40 - i'll be back tomorrow until then have a
145:42 - great day

Cleaned transcript:

hey everybody welcome to live coding with jesse i'm jesse and today we're going to do some work with our navigation so this will be more proper frontend work i know we've been doing some backend work lately but today we're going to get back to the front end and i think i finally sorted out all the issues that i've been having uh with stream quality so i should be running now assuming that your internet connection is fast enough it should run at 1080p 60 frames frames per second the problem uh didn't have anything to do with my settings in obs uh it was with my computer so uh what i found was depending on what i had running i would drop a lot of frames uh so i've turned off all the programs that i don't need and i've closed out most of the tabs that i could and i tested out i'd i'd close everything and it would work i'd open more stuff and it didn't work so so far this works i tested earlier for a little while and it worked the whole time i tested it just this past half hour and only for a few seconds did it drop frames so i think we're good and i don't know really what changed the only thing i did differently on my computer other than close out a lot of things which we already tried before was uh i downloaded the latest update uh for the mac os so there was when i came in this morning there's an update available so i just went ahead and did that straight off and that that seemed to do something because my fan wasn't running you know basically it's been running really hard the whole time i've been using it for the last week so that's all all sorted out hopefully and so we'll get started i don't have anything going on so depending on how the stream goes you might be able to do a longer stream today uh we'll just see uh so let me check the live chat here for a second um not sure i'll see this one live all right so if you you are gonna be able to watch live that's cool thanks for uh for stopping in and saying hi and um as you all know you can always check out the recording later um savage banana says howdy complete noob here done a few bits on free code camp about to do a boot camp looking forward to watching you this evening even though i probably won't understand now i'll be soaking it in all right awesome thanks for watching and feel free to ask as many questions as you want don't worry if you think it's a noob question or something i'm i'm happy to explain something and go over anything that you need all right john said the stream's going well peter says it's looking clean too awesome the ninja says this channel is dope thank you i appreciate that uh abu says will you start coding now i will i will start coding and um as always i know there's some of you that don't like the talking part and you just like the coding part so if that's the case i mean i really love when you can watch live that's awesome but if if it does bother you all the talking uh then feel free to watch the recording and you can just skip ahead and um basically anytime you see just my face and no code then you're safe to skip that and that's totally fine i understand there's not really enough time in the day to listen to me go on and on anyway all right so let's get started and let's change my screen so i'll explain what we're going to do briefly and then we'll we'll get to it so we already talked about what we want to do with this navigation in previous streams in case you've forgotten or you didn't catch that stream here's what's going to happen when we click on one of these links it's going to open up this side drawer and we're gonna have the same links as top level navigation here so it'll say it won't say inbox it'll say about academics admissions faith and life and they'll all be expandable so open up this side navigation with the correct item expanded and all the options shown for instance if i clicked about the about option would be expanded everything else would be not expanded uh so that's the goal what i want to do now the reason i decided to switch and do this today instead of working on some of the stuff we have been working on is well twofold one the stuff that we've been working on lately is going to get real repetitive we've worked out a lot of the you know kind of tough problems that we've had mostly to do with routing and bringing data over now it's just a matter of taking the time to actually do that i don't want to make boring streams of me just constantly doing the same thing over and over again and the second reason is i'm starting to show people this site so i showed my boss's site last week and one of the things that we went over is the menu and i went to click these and i i remembered oh we never made that work and he had asked it was a bit uh we had i discussed it before my boss but it was a long time ago so i had to go over again when we click this then it's going to do that so i think it would be a lot easier when i start to show it to more people to just have it working even if the links don't even go anywhere yet which they won't because we haven't built out you know most of the site yet but i want the functionality to work i think it'll be a lot easier to show people than to explain it so that's what we're going to do and let's see yeah let's check out the component it's been a while since we've even worked on these so i don't remember what we set up in the components and i'm going to be looking at them with fresh eyes basically so we have our app bar component which is where we'll have all right the wrap bar and our drawer are going to be the two components we're going to be working in today the most i already have this running let me get ngrok started for you all and i'm going to paste the link here in the live chat and you all can click on that link go to it and um let's see all right it looks like it is working great so anyway if you're not familiar with ngrok just click the link you'll be able to see this site as we're working on it and test out the changes you can inspect it in dev tools so it'll be a lot more interactive if you're able to to do that all right so let's check out if we have anything set up already so here's all our font icons now this component could definitely use some refactoring to clean it up a bit that's going to happen at some point but my opinion is if you have a deadline you have to meet you get everything working first you can always go back and refactor later but if you spend all your time refactoring and you don't get the project done nobody's gonna care the user's not gonna care when you try to explain to him about refactoring ah the stream's lagging again isn't it no why is it lagging maybe ngrug all right you know what let me shut down ngrok for a second and see if that made a difference because that was really the only different thing that we did right i've changed nothing else wow the video is lagging again have i try to think did i do anything else i don't think i did anything no why why why does it happen now what else is running on my machine it's nothing i guess i could turn off spotify let's turn spotify off um i'm not gonna have my music alright so spotify's off i guess that wasn't it i'm going to turn chrome canary off oh was that what i was using i didn't realize that was a canary window um and that's it i can't i can't turn anything else off um all right i guess i could draw all right am i back let me know if you can hear me obs is saying that everything's fine all right cool all right looks like this will work now and i'm gonna turn my spotify back on because that was not the problem all right cool i really thought i had that figured out this time oh well try again tomorrow unless i really like figure out something significant that fixes this i'm just gonna stream at 720p again tomorrow and not not risk it savage banana says try streaming at 30 frames per second um yeah maybe i'll maybe i can try 1080p but at 30 frames per second see if that'll work i actually didn't even see a setting though for the frames per second which was weird it's possible i'm just looking in the wrong place oh well um all right so let's go let me start a timer so i can know when to come back and answer some questions see i'm gonna go i think this is harsh it right hard [ __ ] this is yours right the essays or pompom.now let's start this one i was using using three different pomodoro timers and uh two of them from that you all made and one of them that i had been using using for years i don't actually i don't know about years how long i've been to a pomodoro definitely more than a year potentially not longer than two though all right let's see all right let me make this a bit bigger so you all can see especially now that we've dropped the uh the video quality a little bit so hopefully that's large enough for you let me know if it's not so let's find our our menu see if we have any click handlers already on here that we can work with otherwise we'll make some let's see svg this is a search all right great so here's where we have this so it looks like all right it looks like we're using uh the typography component that comes with material ui to create an a tag and all right so right now just has an href okay i suppose we don't even really need it to be a link but for now let's let's see where the oops let me bring this back up i forgot we shut it down localhost 3 000. and let me try to bring ngrog back up because i don't think that was actually the problem all right so the links now um in the live chat all right i was just inspecting the this uh this is the li and this is just the a uh the a tag so i was wondering what would be better to put the link on or to you know have the click area hmm all right let me know what you all think uh i guess it would be either way it really doesn't matter i suppose except we may have a slightly larger area would we no we wouldn't i think it would be the same alright so it doesn't matter so let's try to do a an on click should we do an on click or nontouch anything untouched i was looking at a project that i did earlier and we were using on touch tap instead of on click but i can't remember why so i'm just going to go with on click and what we can always change it back if we want video section oh okay uh savage banana found the settings for the frames per second and it's on the um it's in the video section you know that that makes sense now i remember a while ago i had to go to the video section to change some stuff and i i remember because i thought it was it was weird that it was in there instead of the streaming all right harshit says that was mature ui uh 0.26 it's fixed with uh with one okay so we had to use it in a previous version but you don't have to use it now awesome uh thanks for that hardship all right so let's say um open side drawer this dot open side drawer all right so we haven't made it yet but we need to make it and we need to have we're going to pass it something huh yeah we have to pass it something all right so this dot open side drawer and passion hmm um all right so i'm just going to use the name which in this case is faith in life i'm gonna pass that in as a string we'll have to figure out maybe a better way to do this so we don't have to manually type it out but just to get it working first this should work for us so obviously i'd rather have a lot of this stuff in data files and then bring it in instead of having it all hardcoded i would have thought we already had some things built out for this uh all right i was thinking for some reason we had to have some type of click handler to open up the side drawer but we're pulling it in pulling that in from somewhere else i guess um okay i um think if we're going to need to what's this for sorry i'm trying to think out how this works uh we need so we need to be able to share what's going on with two components the app bar and the drawer so i'm assuming they're both tied together in the layout for drawer so i'm just wondering if this should all live in the layout which is where we're getting toggle drawer from so that's as expected i suppose yeah so maybe this is where the um where that should live yeah that makes sense um actually we already have an expansion for the drawer change handle click so the handle click we have in the drawer already expands the items so this is really what we want to use anyway let's pull this up into layout and then from app bar we should be able to just call this function and at the same time uh so we'll call this function and we'll call um the drawer toggle so we'll basically use what we already have i think that'll be the best way to do it all right john has some so faith in life link text should have white space no wrap all right cool thank you um i'll add that in i want to do this first why it's in my mind so i don't lose what i just what i just thought of all right so let's grab our handle click state open items the state open items all right so let me see how we need to pull this out i'm going to try to go i don't know if i could put these two side by side maybe if i close this it would work let me try it out oops this one's layout okay okay uh john has a question that has to do with what we're about to attempt says is it the best practice for a stateful uh furthest up container to control any actions below it pass with props if you need to share if you need to share the state then yes it should be in the parent uh but you you shouldn't get crazy with it so you shouldn't be passing things up like five components like five parent components and that's where things like redux come in and help simplify things so that you don't have to pass everything up from child to parent several levels up because then it can be really confusing and difficult especially if you're going to change something it trying to remember and and go in in every component and make sure you're still passing things down properly is can be difficult uh so i guess so we're not really using redux we're using what is it har should help me out here because harsh is the one was telling me about it so apollo now handles state in a similar way to redux so i guess we could do some of that i haven't worked with it exactly yet but i know that there was some significant update to where you can handle stuff but for now we only need to go up one component just to the parent so i'm totally fine with that if there's some reason why you all think that we should try to use something else to manage state instead of you know just passing it with with props then i'm definitely open to suggestions but i think this should work out in this case all right so here's our layout component this is our parent so what we want to do is add our handle click yeah our handle click we're going to add this over here i'm going to briefly keep the handle click here so that way i can see the original uh and if we edit this i can just go back quickly but then eventually we'll just remove this so what we want to do is pass down uh the handle click so just like we're we're handling we're passing down this toggle drawer so we have this toggle drawer and we're also passing down the state of this so we have this drawer uh true or false whether it's open or close we're gonna do the same thing we need to i'm gonna say handle click i guess we call it let's make this a little bit more descriptive because that's we're gonna have multiple click events going on uh so let's call it expand menu yeah that works expand menu and for expand menu this set state so let's make open open items that's odd how does this sorry i want to see how this behaves now we only have one item all right what i'm worried about here is our open items is just a true or false so i'm wondering if that works with multiple items so let's let's try that check that out quickly list item this class all right let's throw this in here just to see uh okay it's as i thought uh right now this is opening and closing everything which is not what we want we need to change that all right that's fine it's going to be a little bit more complex all right here's so we can do hmm all right what i'm thinking is so number one i want to separate this out into its own component this is way too much to have all of this in this component so the entire for sure we'll grab this whole list item and then the collapse component that comes with it and then we may even want to separate out this collapse as well yeah all right let's do that this is already a bit of a mess all right so let's open up a new tab here list item down to oops labs all right now here's what i we're gonna have to wrap this in a div hopefully it doesn't mess up how this works or how it looks yeah i don't i don't see how we could do that differently um so let's let's make we're gonna call this and render see how we do it yeah return all right great now we can copy and paste this down draw item and let's give it we need react and with styles and link for sure we need link wait are we using link i thought we were but now that i see it we're not all right we're not we need lists yeah we do need list and list item collapse expand less explain more and we need the divider i don't think so at least not yet all right now let's save this our components i'm going to call this drawer item dot js yay all right what did i mess up something oh that's right i need to put this in a div oh i think this is just indentation which all right fix in that problem six all in problems yeah let's see that all right great um classes is not defined so we need to make sure we bring that over classes oops all right the timer went off so let me stop here i'm gonna take five minutes i'm gonna answer any questions uh that you all have and then we'll come back and finish this up as much as we can also when i come back from the fiveminute break maybe i'll take time to explain a little bit of what just happened if you're not familiar with react then this was probably confusing there we go there's a timer all right i'm gonna scroll up to the top and and try to get through as many questions and comments as i can if i don't get your question or comment during this five minute break i will uh most likely get to it in the next one at the end of the stream i'll get to all the comments and questions so just be patient if you can't stick around you can always check out the recording of this uh later on it'll be available on this channel the free code camp youtube channel um samir asks uh hi jesse i'm new to react where can i start um you can always check out the official react documentation like on the react website uh it's not bad i remember when i was first just new and started reading it it was over my head but they do have some beginner tutorials on there so depending on how good you already are with javascript you may do better with that than i did free code camp has a beta curriculum that you can preview and work on they have some react lessons on there i have not gone through them myself but i see other people on twitter have you know talked about going through them so they seem to be good uh code academy has an inbrowser react course and i'm trying to think what else i think those are the main resources if you want to spend money on a course i did go through the udacity react nanodegree if you want to know more about that check out my channel i did do a short video of what my review of that nanodegree program so i'm not going to go over it again since i already have that available but you you can check that out the link to my channel is in the description for this video uh so that's where i would start out now uh if there are also some videos on this channel that go over you know react basics so you could check those out as well and you're more than welcome to watch these streams and i'll do my best to explain everything be sure to ask a lot of questions uh because i'll answer as much as i i possibly can let's see viconius says why programmers haven't got girls i i i have a wife so i'm a programmer and i have a wife so i'm not sure i'm not sure why other programmers might not have them i don't really know i mean i don't know that there's anything inherent to programmers that would make them not have growth i think it's just like a joke um i guess if you spend all your time inside programming then you might be a lot more pale than people like maybe i don't know i'm just messing around now i don't really know um the ninja says in reply says who jesse has a house full of hot shakes that's not i would say singular one hot chick my wife is very hot so i don't have a household i just have one and then uh i do have daughters but uh nobody say that they're they're hot don't talk about my daughters like that my daughters are six and one and a half so uh there's still tiny little people right now um let's see all right there's a lot of comments about the stream whenever it was lagging king mobile says hi to all hey how's it going thanks for watching uh superman says can you give me your opinion on vue.js i i have not used view i haven't even really seen tutorials about vue but i've seen a lot of people who i developers who i do respect that respect their opinion i think they're good developers and they really like vue so my opinion on it now is just i've heard good things about it it seems like it's a good framework so if you want to give it a shot i say go for it i'd like to try it out at some point but i don't have any plans to do it right now i i think that i'm still not where i want to be with my skills and react so the limited time that i have to be able to you know put into kind of training and studying more i'm going to put into react right now and you know maybe one day i'll go with you but i don't have anything against you i haven't to be honest with you i haven't heard anything negative about view it's all been good stuff so if anybody has used view uh would like to put your opinion in uh please put in the live chat now if you're watching the recording later on uh go ahead and put it in the comments and i think that would be helpful for anybody that's you know wondering about you if somebody who's actually used it would weigh in preferably somebody that's use you and react to give uh maybe a comparison all right so my five minute timer is up i'm going to jot down quickly where i left off in the live chat help me get back to it after our our next session all right oh hey i just noticed like 10 minutes ago quincy stopped in i'm not sure if he's still here so but if you are hey quincy thanks for the retweet i appreciate that yo if you don't know who quincy is he's the the founder and head of free code camp so i wouldn't be doing this stream here if it weren't for quincy and uh so i always appreciate when quincy stops in it's always exciting and go ahead and follow quincy on on twitter if you want to find out everything that's going on with free code cam uh he's always always tweeting about all the different things they're doing so that's so much going on here free code camp now um you know we've had the forum for a long time we have the youtube we have two youtube channels now one for talks and one you know this channel that we're on and um have a medium publication with blogs of a podcast now the new beta curriculum is being worked on and is going to come out soon i'm probably missing some other things that we're doing but there's just so much with free code cam uh so if you if you haven't checked out the rest of what is there then you know please please check it out there's so much more and better stuff than than just what i'm doing here on the stream all right so one problem that we had before we stopped is that when we put more than one collapsible item in here right now the way we have it set up they both open and close the same time so we need to fix that but first we're going to clean some stuff up so we've extracted out all the the code we need to make one of these these elements click and everything below it included and we've extracted that out into its own component and we're not we don't have everything uh ready yet we see we still have some little red squiggly lines which means we have errors mainly these aren't defined so we need to define let's see a stylus theme i'm wondering if any of these had to do with your image form control nested i think nested yeah we need to pull the nested clasp but i don't think we'll need any of the other ones so let's bring this in now and then we'll remove what we don't need let's double check yeah that was the only place we were using classes and we need to bring in also dance classes we're open oops a new version of java is available i do not want java run me later why do i still have a java on my computer anyway anyway it popped up on my other screen um i think the open referred to the drawer yeah it did so we don't need open we don't need toggle drawer let's just bring in classes wonderful and style so all right so now we have everything that we need and we may be able to get rid of this let's get rid of this and see that's this in that list item all right great we can get rid of this this was just that that second one we brought in okay so that shortened up our component a little bit nice we may even pull this out at some point i'm okay with it there for now this is that search uh so this is our logo at the top and this is that search input so that's what we're talking about so you see everything below it now has been taken out so first let's just try to put this back in and see if it if it works oh no we didn't have we need this toggle drawer all right we will have to pass toggle drawer down so let's put that back in here toggle drawer and what we call the other one right now it's handle click but we don't want it to be called handle click right we want it to be open item all right yeah we're going to call it open item all right so we have our handle click is now going to be actually our handle click is going to get passed down as a prop from our layout right i'm you know i'm going to check the live chat so i i if you have any questions put them in the live chat i'm going to do a better job of checking back in there to make sure that i'm not losing you feel free to ask questions i'm just gonna really quickly scan through the last few comments turn okay rook says uh that handle click function please change that set state call to the function version uh okay so rooker we're talking about this handle click just to be sure if it's this one uh just let me know that i have the right one this this may be the only one that we've seen but we're actually going to take this out completely from here and we're going to move it up to layout let me grab that we may have done it did we do it already i think we did x expand menu is that what we did we did i went over here and i called it expand menu all right so rook is saying there's a recommended way to update the state based on previous state and so let's let's do that let's set states let's do that here just to show um if you can't see the live chat now i'll kind of type it out for you so this is our previous state and so we can we're going to pass in our previous state and we can update our object so then we would put what open let's see if we've called previously this parameter you can say so our open items is going to be this would be the same name so we do it like this open items equals would need to be something like this and rook's explaining this avoids issues with set state being asynchronous and batching set state calls by default okay great open item preview save on all right awesome so this was uh the correct yeah this is the correct way thanks rook uh i appreciate i appreciate you pointing that out that's cool yeah i um i knew that we could get the previous state i'd never used it before i didn't realize that there was a better performance with this so i'm glad i'll try to keep this in mind and use it it'll probably take me a while before i'm used to this way but i will try to use it uh would it would this way be the best way just by default oh no what did i do would this be the best way by default or should i stick with kind of the normal way unless i i was already using it up here i i probably didn't write this uh one of you probably wrote this and i just merged the pull request but i didn't realize i was already using it uh also i don't need these parens parentheses here same thing just avoids issues when you change database on previous date okay cool um so i will do my best to learn this way and keep using it all right so let me say this expand menu you know what i want to say expand item i think i like that better because really it's a menu item it happens to have a sub menu inside it but i think i like item better since we're calling this a drawer item all right x expand expand item um let's see oh okay rook says you also get access to props in that function as a second argument uh it's not used in a handler right now all right cool that's useful all right so right now the expanding uh and collapsing is was handled in our drawer by state we had open items so what we're going to do now is all right let's do it like this state equals open items why is that defaulted to true you think you'd want it to be defaulted to false right i wanted false maybe just for an example we had it defaulted to true all right so i'm going to put that in here but then i'm going to do a um yeah that's how we'll do it wait a second i just confused myself okay let me explain what i was what i'm thinking here why just confuse myself so our problem was we had both opening at the same time both items would open and close at the same time so my solution i was thinking is let's separate it out into another component let's handle state and that component and then each component each expandable menu would handle its own state and that would work but the problem is that we also need to be able to change the state of that item from another component it's going to be our our app bar component so that that was the issue so it's easy to do it in here if all the states internal the hard part is getting the click to work all right we'll take it one step at a time let's break it down first let's just get this to work we're going to pretend right now like we don't have to do the other step and that'll just simplify things we'll get it to work then we can go to step 2 and figure out how to change the state from outside this component all right so what we'll do then is drawer all right so for now we know we're not going to keep it in here but for now let's just put this in here just to make sure that uh we haven't messed anything up when we move this component over so we should save that that should work and then here we're going to add in let's see bringing in components oops yeah and drawer we are right sorry i'm thinking out loud a bit i've been working so much with the importing data and things i haven't actually worked with react components like this for for a while probably like definitely before before christmas all right so we're going to import drawer item and it's in the same folder so we just need to do dot slash drawer item and then down here we can add a few drawer items to the bottom of our list draw item oops all right so we'll add three of them in there so you save that save that and let's see oops i guess those colors are right i think my colors are a little off from what i used to use in my other editor so sometimes i think i have errors and i really don't all right let's see oops i didn't want to save this yet all right i gotta accidentally save that no all right cool all right so it still opens no all right so our clicks don't work all right i'm glad we um we tried this out first because we did something and the clicks don't even work all right so let's take a look at our drawer item so we do have a state the state's open items oops pretty state open items that's probably our problem no okay so i thought that was the problem because we were trying to change something in state this thing previously open items all right that looks fine let's try out expand item oh expand yeah expand item oh that's right we don't this isn't in props right now and then where's our on click yeah our on click should say this expand item all right so there we go now it works and since each component is handling its own state then they open independently awesome okay so that works uh the reason it didn't work at first was because one i wasn't even changing the right state i was i just had the word open here i didn't have open items so that was a problem and then also our on click was trying to call a function called handleclick which didn't even exist because we changed the name to expand item so those are the the two issues alright so now that that works let's take the next step and see if we can when we click one of these have this open and then have a change so i'd say the first step is let's just make it so that when we click one of these the drawer opens we'll try to do that we'll test that if that works then we'll move on and try to do this and we'll see how much time we have i want to commit this right now since we've kind of got to a point where things are stable and they work and it is an improvement over what we had we're not all the way there yet but i think this is a good point to commit um i'm going to do a git add so what i just did was i added any new files um and basically added any files uh to be ready to be committed and then i'm going to do git commit m which means just i'm going to put my commit message in that's what the m does and i'm going to say create create your item component that's pretty much what we did all right now it's going to run through all our tests so if you want to contribute to the project we got hit with these this is i'm glad this kind of hap this happened like this so if you want to contribute to the project when you go to commit which i encourage anyone who wants to contribute please do especially if you haven't contributed to a project before in github the projects we do on the stream i think are a great chance for you to just get started so i'm not going to get upset if you do a pull request and it's it doesn't work i'll try to help you through it if you have any questions let me know i've had a handful of people submit their first pull request on the things that we work on in the stream and i'm always really happy when that happens so if you want to submit a pr let me know if you need help i'm here to help you but if you do on pretty much all our projects we have some automated testing and linting and formatting so a lot of what you see here is is that going on but i messed up so it's not going to let me commit until i fix this so let's fix it and run it again and it's going to check everything and make sure i did it right this is kind of a good like safety net so that code that obviously doesn't work doesn't get into the project it makes it a little bit easier for me to review the pull requests because there's certain things i know are already going to be there and i don't have to check on so let's see where we're at so it tells us now it's eslint has found some errors so these are basically um like errors that break the rules of es land so obviously these errors haven't caused our application to crash but we don't want this kind of stuff in our code we want it cleaned up so we have some some things that we've defined but never used so we don't want to do that so let's find out where it's at they're all in this drawer.js component so we only have to look in one place which is good and it tells us exactly exactly where they all are so let's check it out line by line i'm going to shrink this a little bit so we can see this is our drawer.js component let's go up here and we have lines 6 seven eight and nine so on line six and it's actually highlighting it here in red so if i would have been more careful and checked before i tried to commit we would have seen it but let's get rid of that list item since we're not using it anymore and these are all things that we took out and moved over to this component that's why we don't need them anymore and now i'm just going to get rid of all these lines and save okay i can verify that everything's still working by going back to my project all right great it still works and now i don't have to type everything in again i'm just going to hit the up arrow key on my keyboard and it brings up that last message that git commit message this will save you a lot of time i was talking to somebody yesterday who didn't know about that on the command line and it's always great when you first learn about that and also the autocomplete like if you hit tab it auto completes when you first learn about that it like changes your world it was so cool to see somebody like learn that for the first time so i'm gonna hit enter again it's going to run through our tests let's make it a bit bigger there we go so i made it through prettier which auto formats i made it through eslint which that's what i got caught at the last time now it's actually running tests so it's opening up a browser it's loading the page and checking to make sure certain elements are actually on the page so you can't see it now the browser opened up on my other screen but it actually i just saw all these tabs open in the browser and different pages in the site load you don't have to have it open up uh there's some options you can run it so you don't see it but you can see it checked our faculty page we don't have tests for all our pages yet that's one of the areas where maybe i should make some issues in the github repo anybody that really wants to write the test feel free but we did test we tested three pages our faculty and it says uh this page can be seen at this ura faculty sum id so whatever id we want to test and it displays the correct data the index can be seen at the correct url which is the root and then page two can be seen at slash page right so we passed all our tests now we're ready to commit or ready to push this so we're going to get push origin and we could type in master here since we want to push it to the master branch but we don't have to we can just use the shorthand hit enter it'll automatically push to master i do need to put in my id since i restarted my computer earlier so let me on my other screen here i'm going to open up lastpass if you're not using a password manager like lastpass i do recommend it that way you can use super long ridiculous passwords and you don't have to remember them you have to remember one your super long ridiculous lastpass password but then all your other ones are covered hmm for some reason lastpass is not opening what did i do all right let me try to open in a different window no all right let me go to this last okay rook says you don't even have to use get push origin you can just use get push and that will work that's really cool i didn't know that um i'm gonna have to log into the desktop version of lastpass since my extension isn't working my chrome extension when i was shutting down clone chrome windows before uh from the task manager in chrome maybe i accidentally did something that messed up lastpass i don't know um actually maybe i just go to the chrome extensions page after i just gave this big uh deal on everybody used lastpass and now it doesn't work hmm i can open up the options for lastpass i just can't open last oh well uh harshit says are you in lastpass premium i am in lastpass premium i could just open it on my phone and type in the password i guess let me do that i was just trying to get out of typing in that big password but hello um all right let me type this in now all right that should work what no all right well let's try to just type get push let me try to type it again maybe i did it wrong yeah it worked this time awesome sorry for the uh the delay okay so that's that's there and that's push to get up so you all can see all the code that we just did you can check it out yourself you can clone the project contribute use it for whatever you want everything's totally open source we use the mit license you can do whatever you want uh i will say like the obviously the logo doesn't fall under that right that's the university's logo um and then like university images but the code itself is mit all right let me let me set my five minute timer i'm gonna go through some questions and then figure out whether or not we want to continue with this and try to get some more to work or maybe we want to save that for tomorrow's stream so if you have an opinion about that let me know i know it can be a long time to watch a stream we've been going for almost an hour and a half now so let me know if you'd rather have me split it up and do some today and some tomorrow or just do it all today uh let's see dinesh asks are you a react developer i guess so um i mean officially i'm a front end developer and i do a lot of react stuff so i think it would be accurate to say i'm a react developer if anyone disagrees with that let me know i'm not really sure what qualifies i'm going to be a react developer but i develop things with react all right john hanson says so i should mostly pass up with props in the functional uh dumb components uh if a component view container needs state to make it standalone component then let them hold their own functions um let me read that again that's props yeah so your your stateless functional components definitely just do props right they're not going to have state yeah so if you need a if you need something to have its own state you can put the functions in there like we did with these list items all right now obviously either later today or tomorrow we're gonna have to deal with the other things that we wanted to do and it may need to change but for now that was the simplest way to get the behavior that we wanted that each component handles its own state john hanson says jesse is a react king i don't know about that uh i'd be happy if i was like i don't know a react duke what are all the titles of royalty right maybe i'm down a little lower um dinesh says as i can see on both the screens you might be working on html and some js framework is that correct which framework is of javascript is it uh it is react so we are using react all right all right let me uh so quincy was in the chat a little while ago and uh quincy did say we're just getting started exciting things in the pipes for 2018. so that's cool i'm excited to see what what happens so i'm not in the loop with all the secret free code camp new stuff coming out so i'm just as excited as any of you might be um let's see let's see let me know if i mispronounced that but anyway they say hey i was making a twitter clone with react.js and material you lie but i couldn't get the twitter's navigation icons like home icon etc how do i get those icons hmm with an ad like icon is like for twitter no i accidentally closed out my my youtube window so i always wondered if my stream would still work if i closed out of youtube and it looks like it did still work let me know did the stream stop at all like a few seconds ago see all right i'm trying to look at the the bottom of the live chat and see if it stops all right cool that was really weird uh so i accidentally closed the tab and now it says that it looks like my stream has restarted from my admin screen because it's saying i've only been streaming for one minute but based on what you are telling me i guess it didn't stop at all i'm just worried because i don't want there to be two videos of this this stream later on uh so as long as that doesn't happen i think it's it's okay uh so anyway the question was about the icons for twitter so the reason i accidentally closed my windows because i was going to open a new tab and look at the twitter icons so i could better answer the question and i accidentally closed out youtube um i don't know where you would get the icons for twitter they may not be available for public use so i would just be careful about that uh you could certainly get some icons that would do that like you have a there's a home icon right you could probably find a little icon of a house somewhere it might not be exactly what's on twitter but i would just be careful to find out if you're allowed to use the twitter icons or not and i mean you may be able i don't know if you'd be able to check in the code if they would have a comment somewhere in there or even i don't know if these are svgs or what i just just opened devtools to see oh it looks like a font icon all right so twitter's using i guess their own font icon set for that so maybe do a search for twitter font icons all right um my time's up i'm just i'm going to go down through how about we'll do this i'm going to go down through i'm going to answer all the questions and everything once we get to the end i'm gonna see how i feel how tired i am streaming takes a lot out of you um it really realistically i'm just sitting here talking and typing but like mentally it's draining to try to focus on the code and the live chat and talk so i might not be up for doing more code after this but there's a lot in the live chat so i want to make sure i get to all your questions we can always finish what we're doing here tomorrow let me check all right stephen says uh jesse just a quick question having a hard time learning javascript any ideas on what i should do i get the concepts just not how to use it um maybe if you need a little help about how to use it maybe check out some like practical projects that use it maybe where they walk you through some of it so maybe like a video where it walks through making a or an actual project would be good and then maybe you could go along with the video like type things out along with the video or you know then go from watching the video to trying to do it on your own in your own way something like that might help you make the connection between you know being able to do like some of the algorithm challenges to actually being able to build things on your own so i know there are some videos on this channel i know beau has some videos and some other people have videos on actually making projects step by step uh that use javascript so maybe try one out some of them might be too advanced so just you know try a few of them out and see what you can do with it i that's probably the best way uh to do things right i think that's like natural learning for people even when we're little we learn by watching other people doing things and then we try it out ourselves so i think that's that's everybody's different but that might be a more natural way is to watch somebody else do it and then try it out as you get confident then you can do your thing and and be more creative with it so anyway i hope that advice works steven uh try it out if it doesn't you know come on back ask me again maybe something specific i could help you out with if if you need it let's see savage savage banana said pics of life or riot i said earlier let's talk about my wife earlier in the stream so um it wouldn't be that hard to figure out who my wife is um we uh follow each other and like each other's stuff on twitter and instagram and facebook so um if you really wanted to figure out who my wife is and find pictures you could find it i'm not going to share them with you but it's not like it's it's a secret let's see uh rick says catch you later have a meeting uh see you rick thanks for joining us good luck with your meeting oh okay we have a little bit more context on stephen's question earlier so um steven's working on the wikipedia viewer in the free code camp challenges and um just not getting it all to work together the right way um great and angel had an idea of um maybe ask someone in the free code camp community to do some peer programming it could help i i think that's a great idea that's even better than watching a video uh if you really need some some help you know oneonone help i'm sure there's a there's some videos out there people actually building the wikipedia viewer i always have mixed feelings about that when i go through the free code camp challenges or anything like that i always like to try to do it on my own before i look at how anyone else did it uh especially i don't mind as much looking at the ui but looking at the code i'd rather not do it i suppose if i'm stuck on the same problem for a really long time it makes more sense to just look at how someone else did it but but having somebody else there with you to just help when you need it i think would be preferable um someone asked about my code editor it is visual studio code oh i do want to share some good news i don't know if this person wants this announced so i'm not going to say a name but somebody who frequently is in the live chat for these streams just got a developer job uh and told me about it within the last few days so really excited about that uh congratulations you know who you are uh if you're cool with me saying your name just let me know uh but anyway really excited that has happened you know several times now where you know someone who's watched the live chat uh was able to get a job it's always really cool when that happens so any good news like that you know if if you if you're comfortable sharing i'd love to hear about it as i get really excited about about stuff like that i think it's cool when like we all develop in our coding and you know our careers develop so anyway again congratulations just thought i'd share that with you all you know a little little inspiration if you are looking for a job now people are getting jobs i'm not saying that it has anything to do with my stream it'd be cool if it did but probably not but people are getting hired it happens keep at it and if you're looking for a job it'll happen just keep keep trying is uh stephen says do so how much javascript do i need to know before i should move to react my ultimate goal is to jump into react uh let's see and in response john says i went from jquery to javascript in about three months i'm doing fairly well with react after four months time yeah i would say i've heard people say that you should get really good with javascript before you go to react and i respectfully disagree with that opinion i think once you know enough javascript to understand the basics of react you're okay to go and do react you will get better with javascript as you do react you'll use different parts of javascript that you never use before when you do react the only thing i would warn against is don't just do react and forget about the rest of javascript actively try to learn more javascript because one day no one will use react probably not going to be anytime soon but at some point your career there'll probably be some other thing and it'll be a lot easier for you to go from react to the other thing assuming the other thing's javascript based which probably will be but it'll be a lot easier for you to go from react to the other thing if you have a good foundation in javascript so just to sum up my advice is go for react as soon as you can start understanding it but keep up your learning of vanilla javascript along the way all right let's see john hanson says awesome jesse a good example of troubleshooting and react thinking ah thanks i appreciate it i felt like i felt like i was in trouble there for a little bit and i kind of looked over and saw how many people are watching it's like ah all these people are gonna think i don't know what i'm doing but that's kind of the draw of the stream right uh to see me struggle through but i was rusty i felt really rusty doing react stuff i was just forgetting like simple things so that long like winter break just uh i i guess i forgot a lot more than i thought i did but that through it we did it helped once i try to break it up into smaller steps so that's good a good tip break things up into small steps one at a time you'll have logical places to do a commit and break it up and you feel less overwhelmed uh miss miss alex says i didn't understand um i'm not sure what you didn't understand if you're still watching could you let me know like more specifics about what you didn't understand i'd be happy to go back and explain something or you know go through a part of the code or anything you need uh rook says those error messages are nice they tell you the file the line and the character spot the column yeah for sure they're they're really nice saves a lot of time rook says is that link clickable the error link let's see uh where's this checker terminal so these aren't clickable but maybe you're talking about the error that comes up here let's try let me do something that gives me an airline i can't click on that popup maybe let me try to do do something like this all right it doesn't look like anything in here is clickable whoa oh that was the get i've never typed clicked on the the get thing all right i'm just going to get out of there because it's confusing me um change 101 let's get out of here it was just showing me the changes that i made all right cool anyway rook i don't know if i was trying to click the right thing but it didn't look like any of that stuff was was clickable you know what all this calculating stuff is not working right i wonder if some of my plugins in visual studio code are what's causing my computer to run maybe this plugin is cool but i really don't need it maybe i should go in and shut off some of the stuff i don't really use all right i'll have to check on that just a thought so harsh it said yeah rook that's amazing so it is clickable i must have just been trying to click the wrong thing then huh uh how to get the terminal on visual studio code to look like in the video you know what i got these colors from udacity's intro to get in github course it's a free course check it out um i think they have two get courses now the older one was taught by two women so do that one if you want to know these colors and they gave some an example file to change all your colors for your terminal and i just took the example i didn't even really change it i just like the colors so that's where i got it from the git and github areas i think it's called intro to get in github on udacity it's one of their free courses so earlier i was talking about tests and writing tests for this and harshit says jesse you also haven't written a test yet with a little winking smiley face oh [ __ ] you are right oh man i just got called out yeah i have not written a test yet i i will say this i have slightly modified some existing tests not for this project but for previous ones but i haven't written one a test on my own so horseshit keeps me honest i didn't i didn't say i wrote a test i just encouraged everyone to write tests yeah so i need to learn more about writing tests myself and uh yeah harshit has i've done all the tests for this project so thank you for that okay oh um i guess so we used get push earlier that only works if you have set the tracking branch already so thanks uh harshit and angel for clarifying that my phone got the oreo update i hate these new emoji i don't remember what the emoji were like was like before the oreo update maybe that's better uh then i won't be bothered by the new ones uh all right so um o o u s s uh os let me know if i'm pronouncing that wrong i'm not really sure how to pronounce that but anyway they say can i tell you something i subscribe to your channel but i never watch your videos this is mainly because they look too advanced uh and the thumbnails do and uh miss a lot of fundamental stuff in my opinion um uh when i watch some of your tutorials uh you go too fast but i still watch some of your videos though i'm not really hating on your channel i respect what you do alright cool i appreciate um the constructive criticism uh yeah so i will say this if if i ever go too fast you're welcome to ask some questions ask me to go back i'm i'm happy to do that but also so the different videos on this channel on free code camp channel serve different purposes if you maybe want a more fundamental tutorial check out some of bose javascript videos i mean it depends on what you want to learn but for instance beau has a lot of basic level javascript all the way up to more advanced stuff this particular series live coding with jesse is not really a tutorial it's more of just showcasing my everyday work so i think the biggest benefit to this aside from the awesome community that we now have you know around this the show is that i mess things up frequently and then we get to work through them live so you kind of get an idea that usually in tutorials you don't have that happen they're well organized and things work whereas with this stream things don't work and we have to work at them often or sometimes we just have to make things work and it's like this is as good as it's going to get right now when we have to you know think of the tradeoffs between doing it one way or another so not everything is perfect so that's it it makes sense that sometimes it seems like it goes too fast or we miss you know go skip over fundamental things uh so i still appreciate you saying that and like i said if you ever want me to explain anything more or go back and do something again let me know i'm happy to do that uh but again i i really appreciate you saying that and the way you said it was very respectful i i definitely appreciate that uh so thank you kamal says uh hey jesse you're doing great work please organize this tutorial in an organized manner react part and material ui part uh would be a great help um kamal says i mean make the react and material ui part uh combined playlist in an organized way uh okay um yeah let me i can probably separate out the tutorials in a better way right now i have like i say what project it's from so the title will say like this this one i think was p5d23 so it's project five day 23. what i will do and i know i've been saying i'm gonna do this and i just haven't really taken the time to is go through and separate every project out into its own playlist i hadn't thought about doing anything like this before but it's a possibility that potentially i could separate out certain topics into their own playlists as well i don't know that might be more confusing but i could do something like here's where we do just all back end stuff here's where we everything where i handle like sending emails from a server or file uploads so there are some things that we seem to be doing like every project that could be i don't know let me know what what do you think would be the best way to organize these i'm still going to have the one big playlist that's just live coding with jesse so you can see everything in one spot but i definitely think it would be good to have playlists for each project is there any other way that i should try to organize these as well i pro i can't go crazy with it because it's not my channel i share it so i don't want to make a million playlists but you know if there's any reasonable way to organize it i'm i'm definitely um open to suggestions okay all right blake's here hey blake how's it going oh okay so kamal said please make a playlist for react.js material ui combined i don't know where to start it's all messed up uh wordpress react node i want react.js only please make a specific playlist for that hmm all right yeah i'll have to think about how to do that because there are times when we switch back and forth so it may be a little bit hard to just isolate react because there are some streams where we'll do node react wordpress all of it in one stream uh sometimes it's hard to just stick to one one thing i'll keep that in mind and i'll i'll try to think about how i could organize them there are definitely some videos that are like obviously one thing or the other they could maybe go into a playlist john hanson says a pinch of clothes is great when making a slow cook stew yum i don't know where that i guess are you cooking john i don't maybe i missed something in the chat um oh says did i did he answer my question i was gone for a second i did answer your question i'm not sure you can always check the recording uh let's see oh umberto says i found out recently that our contract is getting renewed i have no idea for how long yet but hopefully that means i get to keep my job for a while longer umberto that's awesome really awesome um yeah so i mean i guess let me know let me know if you do get to keep it and if you're back in the market looking for job let me know too uh i'd be happy to like i don't know retweet stuff for you help you get some exposure savage banana says becca yeah that's uh yeah my wife's name is becca so i guess you did go and look it up on social media um all right cool harshit says all right we might be on to something now harshit said that that import cost plugin is cpu intensive uh and it crashed um it crashed his computer once so remove import cost all right cool so uh either today or tomorrow i'm gonna try to run on 1080p with that plugin gone and then see if it makes a difference let's see hershey said i messed up pronunciation of kamal sorry about that let me know how i'm supposed to pronounce it properly uh i really i do care about pronouncing uh everyone's name right so uh let me know don't be afraid to correct me if i if i ever say your name wrong all right so uh oh says um i think kamal is right when you organize your projects in their own playlist it would be more attractive and more inviting uh the thing is i'm a software engineer and worked with javascript a lot with but with the new es6 and the new things like babel and import and export and how that stuff works uh like that freaks me out sometimes or the observed thingies it's not that i don't understand javascript just the new things that javascript frameworks offered but if you have videos or tutorials where you group them in playlist they would be so much better in my opinion so i work mainly with c sharp and php okay cool that's good that's good to know thanks for the clarification um yeah so i would say probably it would be more like i can still look at maybe organizing things differently but i would i would say trying to maybe find some specific videos maybe in like bose javascript playlist that have to do do with es6 and some of the newer things might be more helpful to you and then if you want to still watch the stream which is awesome if you do it will help you to understand more of it and i'm still open answering any questions that you have as well nikola says it's it's kind of hard to give a name to a live stream because you don't know exactly what you will finish at the end yeah for sure the hardest part about live streaming is figuring out what title to give the videos no lie that's the hardest part because you're right i just never know sometimes i title a stream and then i don't even get it to work at all or we end up having like some bug and we fix that so that is the hardest part even if i did organize them in the playlist i'd probably still have some things that weren't right because of that because sometimes we just don't actually do what the title says we do and then i never go back and change it which i should uh all says i study now as a software architect and my sequel database and stuff anyways yeah that was that was it i think one more thing my pronoun my name is pronounced like us okay cool thank you for the pronunciation i'll do my best to try to remember that us us okay awesome uh john says yes cooking painting and thinking code soon off to the gym wow that's impressive cooking painting and thinking about code that's that's really impressive i um uh i don't know if i can handle all that at once and still you know not burn the food all right harsh it says to paste and see the pronunciation and translate all right cool let me do that right now come on all right i'm trying i'm trying to listen and get it right it's really like subtle all right i don't know i'm trying my best to get it right i'm having trouble with that one though um let's see let's see harshad said uh to john hanson i looked at your website your oil paintings are awesome they are awesome uh check out john's website if you're into artwork uh he's a really good artist and if you still haven't checked out his light bright react app on codepen check that out as well i tweeted about it last week or something so check out my twitter and scroll down a bit and you'll see a link to it um says thank you for answering my questions jesse you're welcome thanks for watching the stream and being so active in the chat i really appreciate it all right so i've gotten to the end of the live chat and i tell you what i think i'm gonna wait till tomorrow to finish up with with what we're doing uh cause i'm a little bit tired i'd like i'd like a little break like to get something to eat and also now it gives me a good title for the stream tomorrow because i can use the same title and just put part two so that that makes it a lot easier for me um oh yeah one more question vivek says bro tell me how can i do my best in python uh well i don't know a lot about python specifically i do like python i've used it a little bit but i can give you some general advice on how to how to do your best and uh i should make a video about this because i think i've said this you know a few times now in the stream at different times but when you're trying to learn any coding stuff python included uh when you your strategy for for learning more i think should be if you can break it up and learn a little bit every day that's so much better than maybe like let's say every saturday just doing all day on saturday your brain will when your brain's trying to learn something new it's trying to make these little pathways and connections right with with the neurons in your brain i'm not a scientist so if i'm not using the correct terms i mean it is what it is but uh the more you make pathways like think of um if you're taking a hike in the woods right if you walked over the grass every single day a little bit every day the the grass and everything would get beat down and there'd be a path if you only did it once a week it probably wouldn't wouldn't happen the grass would have enough time to grow up and so you wouldn't have that nice path it's the same way with your brain so that will help if you can do a little bit every day if you can do a lot every day it'll help even more but that's my my number one piece of advice when you're trying to learn something you'll retain the knowledge so much better and try to build on it right so when you learn one thing don't just move on to another concept and never use it again try to immediately apply what you learned to a project so do your tutorials but then try to have a project going at the same time and apply it that helps so much when i was learning react with udacity i would immediately use what i learned in udacity on my projects at work and the stuff we did in the stream and so i remembered it so much better so then when i actually got to the point in the udacity course where i had to build my own project i had retained a lot of the knowledge from the lectures and and the little exercises that we had done along the way because i'd already used it so that's just kind of my general advice i think it can be applied safely to a lot of different things in programming and probably to other fields as well um i mean i don't know if if you have like any specific areas about python i don't know how much i can help because i i don't know that much about python um harshit says here's some more specific advice this is good so harsh it says make servers or learn ai says there's a huge scope for python nikola says which time tomorrow will you stream uh in your time um i'm trying to stream i've been trying to stream earlier around noon it seems like a better time for um for time zones that are like in india and in that area of the world so maybe noon or one p.m eastern time in my time so sometimes i have things going on and i can't stick to a time but expect it sometime around there uh vivek says which field is more appropriate in the future ai or networking i don't know ai just it seems like it's really cool these days uh so harsha's answer is good says ai is really hot these days but there's always need of networking yeah yeah i mean i tend to agree it does i i think they'll both still be you know useful and around for a long time if i had to pick honestly assuming that i could safely get a job in either one and support my family i'd pick ai because that just seems it seems really cool to work on harshad also says you should be good at math and math for ai okay it's cool it's good to know that's some good specific advice there harshad also says networking is easier to learn uh abby schick says ionic or react native for android i recommend react native i think react native has some advantages over using ionic uh it lets you use like some more of like the lower level stuff um that you know won't necessarily have access to if you're using ionic now i haven't checked into ionic for years so maybe it's it's different now but as far as i know i think react native gives is is the better way to go uh vivek says what time do you stream in india um i don't know for sure there might be multiple time zones in india but for harsh it's time zone um which i need harsh it's in the himalayas but for that time zone noon would be like 11 p.m right let me know horizon uh is 12 my 12 p.m my time 11 p.m for you it's somewhere around there it might not be exactly 11 uh but i think it's that's close vivek says i'm stuck in many things so i can't decide my my future uh yeah that's tough vivek i mean right now just do what you can with what you have and don't worry about what you can't control you know um that way at least you can make progress with with what you do if it turns out you can end up doing more and have you know some more freedom in your decisions at some point then you'll be prepared uh let's see xavier says any way to contribute to your projects there used to be an option in free code camp to make websites for charities like for free um yeah i'm not sure how that works with the charities thing in free code camp but you can definitely contribute to these projects check out the repositories that we have and you know go to the link check out that whole github organization and any of the repositories just look at the uh look at the issues that are open and you can take one of those and work on it or if you notice some glaring flaw you can open your own issue and you'll work on that if you want if you need any help or ideas just just let me know oh cool good to know vivek says there's only one time zone in india it's gmt all right very good to know that's cool that's nice there's one time zone in the in the u.s we have so many time zones sometimes it's when you're traveling in within the country like it can be confusing um sometimes as you pass through time zones it's like depending on which way you're going it either seems like you gained a lot of time or you lost a lot of time um abby scheck says which library should be used for employing machine learning and web apps uh i i really don't know i don't know enough about that i know there is some uh machine learning javascript libraries out there i'll i don't remember offhand what they're called though uh but they do exist if you're gonna use them in web apps you may as well use javascript because you're going to be using it anyway since it's a web app so that would be my recommendation i don't know if you could run machine learning stuff clientside i assume you'd have to run it server side with node um i don't know it it would kind of be cool if there's a really something really lightweight that you could do basic machine learning stuff in the client but i i don't think that exists i think it's too resource intensive oh wow vivek says it's 1 15 a.m uh it is it is 2 46 p.m right now where i am abby asks is it advisable to learn two javascript frameworks at the same time um i wouldn't try to do it myself i'd rather focus on one and learn it really well the only way i would do that is if i um i wasn't sure whether i wanted to do one or the other and i just wanted to learn the basics of both to make a decision uh but i think it's better to choose i always i i think i mentioned this before in a stream but i i read it really like an old book once uh but it was about basically like ways to live your life to help like improve your brain um and your intellect and uh it was one of the things that it had said was was basically and this is in my own words was if you really want to be good at something you have to say no to everything else so right if you really want to be good at react you say no to angular and view if you really want to be you know and it works with anything in life not just programming it doesn't mean you can't do those other things but you can't do it at the same level right you have to focus there are some people who can be good at a lot of different things but if they would just pick one they could be great at it so if you want to really be great and like one of the best at something you're gonna have to pick other things um which is like i mean that that's kind of freeing and restrictive in the same time because it almost gives you license to be able to focus and you'll be okay with that um but but you do have to decide uh so i guess just think about that some people would may rather just be kind of good at a lot of things or even really good at a lot of things but to get to that best level you do have to choose and so that's why i would say learn one framework well and be really awesome at it that's what i would do but lisa it does depend a little bit on your goals and what your intention is for learning both of them all right i mean if you're in a a company that uses both obviously you have to learn both if you're a freelancer and you want to open yourself up to more clients yeah learn both but if you have the freedom to be able to pick one and stick with it i i would do that oh vivec says for machine learning tensorflow is good it's uh developed by google that's right yeah i i do remember hearing good things about tensorflow haven't used it yet but i've just heard good things uh hardship says javascript is terrible in machine learning use python it says 95 percent uses tensorflow hardship is making an ai chat bot vivec asks where i lived in america i live in ohio i actually live right on the border of ohio and pennsylvania and west virginia like they all meet at one place so i live the the big city that i'm closest to is pittsburgh so i'm pretty close to pittsburgh and so i'm in the eastern time zone so like new york city is in the same time zone that i'm in the whole east coast of the united states is in that time zone all right hey har [ __ ] harshest said stephenville ohio you remembered yes stephenville was a small city uh like i don't know like sixteen thousand people in steubenville i think vivek says uh ohio have their own university yeah so ohio has um a lot of universities so there's a university here in stephenville and that's what that's the university i work for it's uh franciscan university of steubenville there's a and it's so it's an independent school but there are state schools that are like government funded so ohio state is the big state school i believe it's the largest university in the state of ohio and then there's there's a lot of other small universities so small and there are some other state universities as well so there's there's a lot but ohio is one of the more important states in the united states uh several like major cities and things i'm not originally from ohio though i'm from west virginia which is one of the least important states but i i love it i love my home state um vivek says what job do you do i am a i'm officially a front end developer but realistically i i do a lot of back end stuff as well but my title is front and developer and if you'd like to know more about what i do just check out the stream because i'm streaming this from my job so this is my my actual work that i'm doing each day on the stream stuff you don't see are basically me sitting in meetings answering emails and uh sending messages on slack but like my real work is is exactly the same as what i stream let's see um here's another question and wow all right i'm gonna have trouble with this name i'm gonna do my best red jesh rajesh khannan really sorry if i messed that up um says how to improve my web design skill if you want to know more about design i recommend read through some the material design documentation just to get an idea of like the the logic behind design which you have to think about uh and then check out some other designs um so like there are websites that like give awards for the best website designs like check those out just kind of look at what's new and design things you like and don't like um and and then just try things out um you'll get a feel once you look at enough design and work with it enough you'll start to get a feel for what works and what doesn't just by looking at it you'll be able to look and say no those colors don't work i need more white space uh this needs to be a few pixels one way or the other like it takes a while to get that but eventually like you'll get it and i'm not saying i'm the best at design but you know i'm definitely at the point where i can look at something and say this will look better if it were adjusted a few pixels or those colors definitely don't work um and at that point and then you know even beyond i'm sure there are people that are even so much better at that and can come up with an awesome design like you know right off just off the top of their head on a piece of paper or something but that would be my advice just kind of check out the designs that are prominent now read about like why they do it and check out some of the websites that are really getting like recognized for having good design uh let's say yes abby six says how to make svg responsive and web pages um harshad said media queries yeah media queries so i'll tell you what check out some of the videos by sarah drazner um she's really good with svg's and so check out some of her stuff i've heard some of her talks before where she covers like responsiveness and svg's and it's actually a lot better to use svg's as opposed to normal images if you want things to look great on different screens because there's i don't know there's really cool stuff that you can do there's so much you can do with svg so i check out some of her stuff if you want to learn more about it but essentially yes like media queries work a lot using like percentage widths instead of um like a fixed width you know helps a lot uh but i think was sarah drazner yeah that's drasner uh vivek says bro you live in america it's great but i live in india it's also great but i want to get a job in google california yeah um it'd be great to work at google uh they have you make a lot of money there's um like a great a lot of like perks to working at google like you most likely have access to a lot of awesome technology they also have a lot of different locations worldwide as well so i mean it'd be cool to live in california i wouldn't want to live there though because it's really really expensive to try to find a house or an apartment in california but google does have other locations like they actually have a location in pittsburgh which would be really cool to work at i could i could live in the same house i live in now and just commute into pittsburgh and work at google there if they'll they'll have me if anybody from google is watching i mean give me a call maybe we'll see uh i like my job right now and where i'm at but i probably would not turn down something from google it's just a great opportunity um assuming i would even good enough to work there i don't know about that um let's see whoa uh all ozos just put a lyric up from country roads which is basically like the the theme song of my home state of west virginia so you you just made my heart feel like longing for my homeland right now just from that lyric so i'm gonna like be singing that song all day every true west virginian knows all the words to that song and can sing it whenever it comes on so how did you know about that song um well i really i appreciate that that's awesome you put that in there um let's see oh yeah so they're saying sarah drazner works at microsoft yeah yeah she works at microsoft she's really active on twitter as well uh you check out her twitter stuff she has she's spoken at a ton of different conferences so she's on a lot of different youtube channels for different things she i think she has a talk on free code camps talk channels so free codecam has two different channels if you check out their talk channel um then uh i think she's on there but yeah everything i've ever seen her do with svg's is just amazing i should say jesse they will probably not hire a react engineer as facebook yeah i don't i assume i'd be doing other things and and not react i don't does google use react for anything i don't know maybe they do um yeah so maybe i'd be doing other stuff but i mean they gotta have people writing javascript right they have a lot of websites so i'd probably be doing something with javascript i do use a lot of material design and google uh google invented that so maybe maybe there's a show for me um john hanson says it's for you google's calling yeah be crazy if they actually did call me during a stream at some point um all right i've gotten to the end of the live chat finally all right so i think i'm going to stop for real this time uh thanks everyone for watching uh we we did some good stuff uh didn't get everything done that i wanted to but um the work that we did it worked so that's that's a plus so i'll be back tomorrow i'm going to try to stream sometime around like noon or 1pm uh another question um says would you recommend for me to go to into app academy um i'm not sure exactly what app academy is but my recommendation for any type of thing like that or boot camp or something is check it out to make sure that they're legitimate and see like do people really get jobs from this check on the price if you can afford it and you can take the time and it seems like it's a reputable thing then go for it i've never done anything like that uh so i can't tell you personally but like my wife's doing a boot camp right now and she seems to be really happy with it so um without knowing more details that's just kind of my general advice uh all right so now let me get out of here i'm really hungry at this point so i actually do want to end the stream uh and get something to eat so thanks so much everyone for watching i'll be back tomorrow until then have a great day
