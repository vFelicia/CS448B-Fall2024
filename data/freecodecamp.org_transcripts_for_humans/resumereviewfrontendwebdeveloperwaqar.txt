00:00 - hey guys benjamin's back here again
00:03 - doing another resume review this time
00:05 - we're taking a look at wakara mohammed's
00:08 - resume and
00:10 - i'm also going to do a portfolio review
00:13 - that someone else had provided
00:15 - but i'm going to put that in a separate
00:16 - video and probably put that on my own
00:18 - channel i'm going to reserve the resume
00:20 - reviews
00:21 - directly for
00:22 - my channel and for re-syndication on
00:25 - free code camp
00:26 - okay so i have this basic intake form
00:31 - set up
00:32 - you guys can find the link to this in
00:33 - the description as well and basically i
00:36 - just have a little disclaimer saying hey
00:38 - make sure you're removing phone numbers
00:40 - uh your address email address from your
00:42 - resume unless you're comfortable with
00:43 - the email address being
00:45 - included and required did that so that's
00:48 - great you know he does have his email
00:49 - address and he's comfortable sharing
00:51 - that
00:52 - uh let's see and then he also wanted to
00:54 - share his twitter profile github
00:56 - what he's interested in and which
00:58 - industry is interested in okay didn't
01:00 - fill out an industry but that's fine uh
01:02 - let's see wants to be a junior web
01:04 - developer
01:05 - and okay we have his
01:08 - social media profile here for twitter so
01:11 - i'm just going to go ahead and
01:13 - open all these up we also got github
01:17 - so we're going to do a resume review
01:20 - going to take a quick look at his
01:22 - portfolio site but not really focus on
01:24 - it
01:25 - because that's not the the focus of this
01:27 - video and then that's just a link to our
01:29 - resume
01:31 - cool just going to take a look i do like
01:33 - that the the contact info is up here i
01:36 - dig the layout nice thick
01:39 - horizontal lines uh same thing with the
01:42 - text used
01:44 - and great contrast of text colors as
01:47 - well
01:48 - you know definitely with the orange
01:49 - getting all of the
01:50 - pertinent details popping out
01:53 - and
01:54 - different font faces love that great
01:56 - design
01:58 - overall really dig the layout
02:01 - uh let's see
02:03 - yeah so overall i love the layout let's
02:05 - let's just go from the top so let's see
02:07 - as a highly motivated and result
02:09 - oriented manager within the tech field i
02:12 - have a proven track record of providing
02:14 - exemplary levels of service along with
02:17 - high quality technical
02:19 - and digital content strategy yeah i
02:22 - think that that's a solid intro one
02:24 - thing i think i would
02:27 - maybe focus on a little bit more is
02:30 - highlighting
02:32 - some examples of high technical quality
02:34 - um
02:36 - you know you mention a proven track
02:38 - record so
02:40 - perhaps put in some metrics there but
02:42 - i'll continue reviewing
02:44 - uh the resume and then we'll get back to
02:46 - that
02:47 - same thing let's see digital content
02:48 - strategy i would recommend maybe some
02:51 - digital content projects that you've
02:53 - worked on
02:54 - listing those
02:55 - or perhaps listing different types of
03:00 - let's say digital marketing like search
03:01 - engine optimization for example or
03:04 - conversion rate optimization or
03:07 - analytics
03:08 - something a little bit more specific to
03:10 - include concrete details
03:13 - again i think a lot of people may
03:15 - disagree with me on this but
03:17 - i definitely think that you should have
03:19 - longer than just a one pager
03:21 - i think you should have and this is just
03:23 - personal opinion have your
03:25 - relevant skills kind of near the top
03:27 - relevant projects near the top
03:29 - especially if you're a junior dev uh you
03:32 - don't really want to be leading in with
03:34 - experience that doesn't necessarily tie
03:36 - into
03:37 - the web development job that you're
03:38 - seeking
03:39 - ideally i would
03:41 - you know like in this publish article
03:43 - section have a few of your github
03:45 - repositories or projects and have those
03:48 - kind of near the top
03:49 - maybe under the overview in between
03:51 - experience
03:54 - yeah probably in between experience and
03:56 - then maybe moved articles up a little
03:57 - bit because honestly in my experience
04:00 - a lot of
04:01 - uh recruiters that i've worked with
04:04 - and hiring managers haven't really ever
04:06 - asked about my education or skills the
04:09 - only exception to that is
04:11 - they'll just say hey do you have a
04:12 - four-year degree but they never ask
04:14 - where's the four-year-degree degree from
04:16 - they never ask what's your gpa
04:19 - so one thing to keep in mind there
04:21 - i would recommend putting your education
04:24 - and skills near the bottom and
04:25 - highlighting your projects because
04:27 - essentially you want to be saying to the
04:29 - hiring manager
04:31 - look this is the work that i've done
04:33 - i can complete projects and here are the
04:37 - um
04:39 - the projects that i've completed so
04:40 - definitely you know check them out and
04:44 - you know showcase your work that way
04:46 - anyway i feel like i've kind of covered
04:47 - that quite a bit
04:49 - uh so let's see we have signature design
04:51 - consultants ltd uh company director
04:56 - okay providing
04:57 - consultancy and technical support to sme
05:01 - i'm not sure what that means
05:03 - on
05:04 - digital and web strategy for web and
05:07 - mobile applications and digital
05:08 - marketing
05:10 - um okay well out of curiosity this isn't
05:13 - something a hiring manager or anyone
05:14 - like that is probably going to do again
05:16 - i mentioned they only
05:19 - review a resume for probably about i
05:21 - would say 30 seconds or so if you're
05:23 - lucky
05:24 - um okay so this probably stands for
05:27 - small and medium-sized enterprises or
05:29 - small and medium-sized businesses
05:31 - cool cool got that instead of putting
05:34 - sme i would recommend
05:35 - maybe listing a couple of clients
05:37 - they're proud of working with you know a
05:38 - couple maybe say two medium-sized
05:41 - businesses and one small size business
05:43 - you know i just use that general rule of
05:46 - three to really market to um
05:50 - you know people's mindset and kind of
05:51 - short term memory uh so that those few
05:54 - clients that you've worked with stick in
05:56 - their memory i would also elaborate on
05:57 - consultancy and technical support like
06:00 - what sort of projects did you consult on
06:02 - uh what kind of technical support did
06:05 - you provide and i know you mentioned web
06:07 - and mobile applications and digital
06:09 - strategy but i would recommend
06:11 - mentioning one some of the clients that
06:13 - you worked with as i mentioned and two
06:16 - some of the projects that you worked on
06:17 - for those clients so again you're just
06:20 - really highlighting the projects and
06:21 - work that you've done like i said i
06:23 - really do like the layout i really do
06:25 - like the use of fonts and i really do
06:26 - like the
06:28 - color contrast that i've used okay and
06:30 - then total airport marketing consultant
06:32 - you know make it make it past tense and
06:34 - kind of uh break this up because this is
06:36 - just kind of one
06:38 - like run-on sentence
06:39 - you could either break it out into
06:42 - a couple different ways to display it
06:43 - you could break it down into say bullet
06:44 - points like say there's a bullet point
06:46 - and then you know that next part is a
06:48 - bullet point for training and then the
06:50 - other one is you know the amount of
06:52 - sales that you did then boom you got
06:54 - three solid bullet points you're using
06:56 - the rule at three and uh then you're
06:58 - also providing your facts and figures
07:00 - it's easy to read and it's in past tense
07:03 - um so yeah overall i think good content
07:06 - in there can be rewarded a little bit
07:08 - and instead of doing these uh kind of
07:11 - like run-on sentences where you're
07:12 - trying to smush everything together
07:14 - just break them out into bullet points
07:16 - it'll be easier for people to skim uh
07:18 - let's see
07:20 - stansberry supermarkets department
07:22 - manager okay cool so i imagine here
07:26 - you're trying to highlight some of your
07:27 - managerial experience i'm looking at it
07:29 - now this is october 2013 was the end
07:31 - point and it we're already in november
07:34 - of 18. typically i wouldn't uh list
07:37 - anything
07:38 - later than you know five years ago in
07:40 - the past
07:42 - so honestly i would recommend just
07:44 - removing this uh adding a little bit
07:47 - more
07:48 - allowing it to free up a little bit more
07:49 - space and then as i mentioned earlier uh
07:51 - providing some of those projects that
07:53 - you've worked on and listing that there
07:55 - you know as you as you can notice you
07:58 - can probably spot a trend here i'm
08:00 - just trying to highlight projects
08:02 - projects projects skim ability okay cool
08:04 - and then you have some of your skills
08:06 - web related skills
08:08 - now i understand probably why you kept
08:10 - it this way you wanted to make it
08:12 - clean and skimmable yeah honestly i
08:14 - would recommend adding in more skills
08:17 - here strike that balance between keyword
08:19 - stuffing now if you're not familiar with
08:21 - the phrase keyword stuffing is basically
08:24 - just that taking these keywords or these
08:26 - phrases and putting in things that are
08:28 - relevant to
08:29 - the audience that you want to get in
08:30 - front of and then just kind of peppering
08:33 - a bunch of those in putting putting a
08:34 - bunch of those in
08:37 - so i would recommend writing down some
08:39 - other technologies that you've worked
08:40 - with like css great but maybe put css
08:44 - and then css3
08:46 - if you've worked with sas i would also
08:48 - put in sas you know a css preprocessor
08:52 - if you worked with html i would also put
08:54 - in html5
08:56 - uh also anything that goes along with
08:58 - laravel
08:59 - since that is a php framework i would
09:01 - recommend putting in php
09:04 - uh putting in any package managers that
09:06 - go with that i believe that's symphony
09:08 - if i'm not mistaken
09:10 - uh same thing with javascript if you've
09:12 - messed a little bit with uh node you
09:15 - messed a little bit with react go ahead
09:16 - and list those you want to be
09:18 - transparent and you don't want to lie
09:19 - about the amount of experience that you
09:21 - have with a particular technology you
09:23 - also though want to make sure that
09:25 - you're giving yourself a running start
09:28 - you're making sure that you're giving
09:29 - yourself a decent chance of getting in
09:31 - front of the right people listing every
09:33 - technology especially when you're
09:35 - starting out listing every technology
09:37 - that you've touched it's marketing cool
09:40 - and this is where you highlight on ppc
09:42 - seo sem and digital content okay so
09:45 - that's what you alluded to up here
09:47 - um
09:48 - yeah so let's let's go back to the the
09:50 - overall uh overview here so as i
09:53 - mentioned you may want to put in uh pick
09:56 - one or two of these that you feel that
09:58 - you're the strongest with
09:59 - and pepper those in and kind of put
10:02 - those about your
10:03 - your overview i feel like we we've
10:05 - covered the the resume pretty
10:07 - pretty well i'm just going to go ahead
10:08 - and pull up these articles yeah this is
10:11 - good i mean it does show your kind of
10:13 - political slant
10:15 - as it mentions down here
10:17 - business models politics also shows your
10:19 - interest in entrepreneurship and
10:22 - kind of by proxy your interest in
10:24 - the entertainment sector which is
10:26 - fantastic i think though as i mentioned
10:28 - i would probably save this
10:30 - for your cover letter because on your
10:33 - cover letter that's where you really
10:34 - want to showcase your personality and
10:37 - other aspects of what make you up as an
10:40 - individual whereas the resume is more so
10:42 - just kind of the down and dirty uh
10:45 - here's what i can do here's what i have
10:47 - done
10:48 - um
10:49 - you know that sort of thing your
10:50 - experience your skills your projects
10:53 - like a few
10:54 - uh different articles that
10:57 - i think kind of show your personality in
10:59 - general so i would say one about kind of
11:02 - startup culture one about
11:04 - um social media and then one about say
11:07 - security
11:09 - uh then that will kind of give a decent
11:12 - holistic view of the things you're
11:14 - interested in and with those you just
11:16 - pick the best ones and present those at
11:18 - the top of your cover letter but
11:20 - since you have two profiles you have
11:22 - this one here this one's political
11:24 - politics religion i would
11:26 - just avoid that in general
11:28 - and go with this you know this looks
11:30 - like a
11:33 - solid you know code related profile
11:35 - you know you're saying you're a lawyer
11:36 - previously and
11:38 - now you're focused on software
11:40 - engineering you like javascript and
11:41 - laravel
11:42 - perfect this is what hiring managers
11:44 - really like to see and you can even
11:46 - include this in your cover letter and
11:48 - you can elaborate on that a little bit
11:49 - with a couple more sentences if you want
11:51 - because people people love that they
11:53 - know that lawyers are
11:55 - diligent they know that you have to be
11:57 - focused you have to study hard
12:00 - i'm not sure if you had to pass some
12:01 - sort of a bar exam or some sort of a
12:04 - you know like entry level exam
12:06 - but that's also another thing you can
12:08 - kind of put out there there's usually a
12:10 - good
12:11 - connotation associated with lawyers
12:14 - this is good you have a sense of humor
12:17 - if i were a hiring manager i'd want to
12:18 - see that i think you had shared this
12:20 - with me today
12:22 - this is you on dev2
12:26 - and you're basically talking about the
12:29 - frustration between learning a i think
12:31 - was a solid language and learning a
12:33 - framework and you also have decent
12:36 - engagement here
12:38 - with uh some of the commenters which is
12:41 - fantastic
12:43 - this would be an article honestly that i
12:45 - would
12:46 - also put on your on your cover letter
12:48 - the hr professional isn't going to
12:50 - probably look at that the hiring manager
12:53 - is more than likely going to be looking
12:55 - at
12:56 - tech related content that you do share
12:58 - especially on twitter okay and you're
13:00 - also staying culturally relevant to the
13:02 - overall developer community you're
13:04 - talking about hacktoberfest could be
13:06 - part but felt like i couldn't this year
13:09 - not only did i take part when i bagged a
13:11 - t-shirt oh okay so you did actually
13:13 - complete it yeah dude so highlight that
13:15 - too i mean like that that keeps you
13:18 - relevant that helps tell a story it
13:20 - shows that you're interested in open
13:22 - source that again goes to some of the
13:24 - projects like highlight some of those
13:27 - open source projects
13:28 - on your resume the the hr professionals
13:31 - may not fully understand what you're
13:33 - working on but if they see those
13:35 - projects they'll at least have a general
13:37 - idea okay this guy
13:39 - can do something let's get this in front
13:41 - of a hiring manager and get a second
13:42 - opinion get an informed opinion and then
13:44 - when a hiring manager sees it and he
13:46 - sees that you contribute to open source
13:48 - and he sees that you're culturally
13:49 - relevant to digital ocean and
13:52 - hacktoberfest and you're overall in the
13:55 - larger ecosystem of development and
13:57 - you're engaged that's gonna earn you a
13:59 - lot of brownie points but yeah all
14:02 - together man love this twitter account
14:04 - definitely highlight the open source
14:06 - projects that you worked on definitely
14:08 - highlight your sense of humor and i
14:10 - would say definitely highlight your
14:14 - your accomplishments with oktoberfest
14:15 - because
14:16 - that's that's no easy task so great job
14:19 - with that
14:19 - you have your portfolio we're just going
14:21 - to take a quick look at this okay so you
14:24 - have your social media links i'm not
14:25 - going to
14:26 - click through those click on here
14:29 - awesome that's
14:43 - about your focus okay cool
14:45 - credit apis in laravel framework and
14:47 - then you're talking about creating three
14:49 - applications
14:50 - uh crud and apis
14:53 - yeah there you go dude like that's
14:55 - that's some of your summary that's
14:57 - that's some of your project bullet
14:58 - points like seriously
15:00 - boom you got a highlight right there you
15:02 - know that's your that's your highlight
15:04 - reel man you gotta put that on the
15:06 - display front and center on your resume
15:08 - um
15:10 - okay cool and you're also talking about
15:12 - doing blogging and basic video tutorials
15:15 - um
15:16 - yeah then you can basically use this as
15:19 - your highlight reel to kind of start off
15:21 - the section for your articles on your
15:23 - cover letter
15:26 - okay and then you're also talking about
15:28 - your work with free code camp
15:31 - uh you're talking about your future
15:33 - goals
15:34 - fantastic as a junior developer people
15:36 - are really going to want to see that you
15:39 - still have plans to continue to grow and
15:41 - continue to improve yourself and that
15:43 - you're worth the investment of time and
15:46 - money that they're putting into hiring
15:47 - you as a junior asset
15:49 - definitely include something like that
15:50 - in your cover letter
15:52 - and i know this is controversial i would
15:55 - recommend including the photo
15:57 - in your cover letter or in your
16:00 - resume
16:02 - some people will strongly disagree with
16:03 - me on that but i think it's it's
16:05 - worthwhile uh you know maybe get one
16:07 - that's facing directly towards the
16:09 - camera and you know maybe wear like
16:12 - something relatively uh professional but
16:14 - overall this would be a fine photo as
16:16 - well
16:17 - okay but again yeah highlight reel men
16:20 - projects you've worked on but i'm front
16:21 - and center on that resume
16:25 - okay and
16:27 - yep you also have a
16:28 - portfolio looks like all of this is
16:31 - pertaining to
16:32 - the free code camp challenges cool
16:36 - but yeah i would definitely recommend
16:38 - putting in some highlights of
16:41 - the open source projects that you
16:43 - contributed to for hacktoberfest
16:46 - okay and then you have the contact me
16:49 - cool and that's nice and simple
16:51 - yeah in terms of the
16:53 - layout of this love it man nice and
16:55 - responsive
16:56 - you know this is definitely something
16:59 - i would also highlight in your
17:02 - resume
17:03 - probably near the top with some social
17:05 - media links and if you want to double
17:07 - down on that also highlight that on your
17:10 - cover letter because you want to get
17:12 - uh you know the these projects and these
17:15 - um
17:16 - bullet points that you
17:18 - you know that you've
17:20 - worked hard on in front of the the
17:21 - hiring manager and the hr professional
17:23 - cool it looks like you are uh
17:26 - highlighting things that you actually
17:27 - have worked on here and making use of
17:29 - the popular repositories
17:31 - so that's great
17:33 - you do have a fairly active graph here
17:35 - that's nice to see
17:37 - and cool and then here are some of the
17:40 - pull requests that you're working on for
17:41 - hacktoberfest with free code camp

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys benjamin's back here again doing another resume review this time we're taking a look at wakara mohammed's resume and i'm also going to do a portfolio review that someone else had provided but i'm going to put that in a separate video and probably put that on my own channel i'm going to reserve the resume reviews directly for my channel and for resyndication on free code camp okay so i have this basic intake form set up you guys can find the link to this in the description as well and basically i just have a little disclaimer saying hey make sure you're removing phone numbers uh your address email address from your resume unless you're comfortable with the email address being included and required did that so that's great you know he does have his email address and he's comfortable sharing that uh let's see and then he also wanted to share his twitter profile github what he's interested in and which industry is interested in okay didn't fill out an industry but that's fine uh let's see wants to be a junior web developer and okay we have his social media profile here for twitter so i'm just going to go ahead and open all these up we also got github so we're going to do a resume review going to take a quick look at his portfolio site but not really focus on it because that's not the the focus of this video and then that's just a link to our resume cool just going to take a look i do like that the the contact info is up here i dig the layout nice thick horizontal lines uh same thing with the text used and great contrast of text colors as well you know definitely with the orange getting all of the pertinent details popping out and different font faces love that great design overall really dig the layout uh let's see yeah so overall i love the layout let's let's just go from the top so let's see as a highly motivated and result oriented manager within the tech field i have a proven track record of providing exemplary levels of service along with high quality technical and digital content strategy yeah i think that that's a solid intro one thing i think i would maybe focus on a little bit more is highlighting some examples of high technical quality um you know you mention a proven track record so perhaps put in some metrics there but i'll continue reviewing uh the resume and then we'll get back to that same thing let's see digital content strategy i would recommend maybe some digital content projects that you've worked on listing those or perhaps listing different types of let's say digital marketing like search engine optimization for example or conversion rate optimization or analytics something a little bit more specific to include concrete details again i think a lot of people may disagree with me on this but i definitely think that you should have longer than just a one pager i think you should have and this is just personal opinion have your relevant skills kind of near the top relevant projects near the top especially if you're a junior dev uh you don't really want to be leading in with experience that doesn't necessarily tie into the web development job that you're seeking ideally i would you know like in this publish article section have a few of your github repositories or projects and have those kind of near the top maybe under the overview in between experience yeah probably in between experience and then maybe moved articles up a little bit because honestly in my experience a lot of uh recruiters that i've worked with and hiring managers haven't really ever asked about my education or skills the only exception to that is they'll just say hey do you have a fouryear degree but they never ask where's the fouryeardegree degree from they never ask what's your gpa so one thing to keep in mind there i would recommend putting your education and skills near the bottom and highlighting your projects because essentially you want to be saying to the hiring manager look this is the work that i've done i can complete projects and here are the um the projects that i've completed so definitely you know check them out and you know showcase your work that way anyway i feel like i've kind of covered that quite a bit uh so let's see we have signature design consultants ltd uh company director okay providing consultancy and technical support to sme i'm not sure what that means on digital and web strategy for web and mobile applications and digital marketing um okay well out of curiosity this isn't something a hiring manager or anyone like that is probably going to do again i mentioned they only review a resume for probably about i would say 30 seconds or so if you're lucky um okay so this probably stands for small and mediumsized enterprises or small and mediumsized businesses cool cool got that instead of putting sme i would recommend maybe listing a couple of clients they're proud of working with you know a couple maybe say two mediumsized businesses and one small size business you know i just use that general rule of three to really market to um you know people's mindset and kind of short term memory uh so that those few clients that you've worked with stick in their memory i would also elaborate on consultancy and technical support like what sort of projects did you consult on uh what kind of technical support did you provide and i know you mentioned web and mobile applications and digital strategy but i would recommend mentioning one some of the clients that you worked with as i mentioned and two some of the projects that you worked on for those clients so again you're just really highlighting the projects and work that you've done like i said i really do like the layout i really do like the use of fonts and i really do like the color contrast that i've used okay and then total airport marketing consultant you know make it make it past tense and kind of uh break this up because this is just kind of one like runon sentence you could either break it out into a couple different ways to display it you could break it down into say bullet points like say there's a bullet point and then you know that next part is a bullet point for training and then the other one is you know the amount of sales that you did then boom you got three solid bullet points you're using the rule at three and uh then you're also providing your facts and figures it's easy to read and it's in past tense um so yeah overall i think good content in there can be rewarded a little bit and instead of doing these uh kind of like runon sentences where you're trying to smush everything together just break them out into bullet points it'll be easier for people to skim uh let's see stansberry supermarkets department manager okay cool so i imagine here you're trying to highlight some of your managerial experience i'm looking at it now this is october 2013 was the end point and it we're already in november of 18. typically i wouldn't uh list anything later than you know five years ago in the past so honestly i would recommend just removing this uh adding a little bit more allowing it to free up a little bit more space and then as i mentioned earlier uh providing some of those projects that you've worked on and listing that there you know as you as you can notice you can probably spot a trend here i'm just trying to highlight projects projects projects skim ability okay cool and then you have some of your skills web related skills now i understand probably why you kept it this way you wanted to make it clean and skimmable yeah honestly i would recommend adding in more skills here strike that balance between keyword stuffing now if you're not familiar with the phrase keyword stuffing is basically just that taking these keywords or these phrases and putting in things that are relevant to the audience that you want to get in front of and then just kind of peppering a bunch of those in putting putting a bunch of those in so i would recommend writing down some other technologies that you've worked with like css great but maybe put css and then css3 if you've worked with sas i would also put in sas you know a css preprocessor if you worked with html i would also put in html5 uh also anything that goes along with laravel since that is a php framework i would recommend putting in php uh putting in any package managers that go with that i believe that's symphony if i'm not mistaken uh same thing with javascript if you've messed a little bit with uh node you messed a little bit with react go ahead and list those you want to be transparent and you don't want to lie about the amount of experience that you have with a particular technology you also though want to make sure that you're giving yourself a running start you're making sure that you're giving yourself a decent chance of getting in front of the right people listing every technology especially when you're starting out listing every technology that you've touched it's marketing cool and this is where you highlight on ppc seo sem and digital content okay so that's what you alluded to up here um yeah so let's let's go back to the the overall uh overview here so as i mentioned you may want to put in uh pick one or two of these that you feel that you're the strongest with and pepper those in and kind of put those about your your overview i feel like we we've covered the the resume pretty pretty well i'm just going to go ahead and pull up these articles yeah this is good i mean it does show your kind of political slant as it mentions down here business models politics also shows your interest in entrepreneurship and kind of by proxy your interest in the entertainment sector which is fantastic i think though as i mentioned i would probably save this for your cover letter because on your cover letter that's where you really want to showcase your personality and other aspects of what make you up as an individual whereas the resume is more so just kind of the down and dirty uh here's what i can do here's what i have done um you know that sort of thing your experience your skills your projects like a few uh different articles that i think kind of show your personality in general so i would say one about kind of startup culture one about um social media and then one about say security uh then that will kind of give a decent holistic view of the things you're interested in and with those you just pick the best ones and present those at the top of your cover letter but since you have two profiles you have this one here this one's political politics religion i would just avoid that in general and go with this you know this looks like a solid you know code related profile you know you're saying you're a lawyer previously and now you're focused on software engineering you like javascript and laravel perfect this is what hiring managers really like to see and you can even include this in your cover letter and you can elaborate on that a little bit with a couple more sentences if you want because people people love that they know that lawyers are diligent they know that you have to be focused you have to study hard i'm not sure if you had to pass some sort of a bar exam or some sort of a you know like entry level exam but that's also another thing you can kind of put out there there's usually a good connotation associated with lawyers this is good you have a sense of humor if i were a hiring manager i'd want to see that i think you had shared this with me today this is you on dev2 and you're basically talking about the frustration between learning a i think was a solid language and learning a framework and you also have decent engagement here with uh some of the commenters which is fantastic this would be an article honestly that i would also put on your on your cover letter the hr professional isn't going to probably look at that the hiring manager is more than likely going to be looking at tech related content that you do share especially on twitter okay and you're also staying culturally relevant to the overall developer community you're talking about hacktoberfest could be part but felt like i couldn't this year not only did i take part when i bagged a tshirt oh okay so you did actually complete it yeah dude so highlight that too i mean like that that keeps you relevant that helps tell a story it shows that you're interested in open source that again goes to some of the projects like highlight some of those open source projects on your resume the the hr professionals may not fully understand what you're working on but if they see those projects they'll at least have a general idea okay this guy can do something let's get this in front of a hiring manager and get a second opinion get an informed opinion and then when a hiring manager sees it and he sees that you contribute to open source and he sees that you're culturally relevant to digital ocean and hacktoberfest and you're overall in the larger ecosystem of development and you're engaged that's gonna earn you a lot of brownie points but yeah all together man love this twitter account definitely highlight the open source projects that you worked on definitely highlight your sense of humor and i would say definitely highlight your your accomplishments with oktoberfest because that's that's no easy task so great job with that you have your portfolio we're just going to take a quick look at this okay so you have your social media links i'm not going to click through those click on here awesome that's about your focus okay cool credit apis in laravel framework and then you're talking about creating three applications uh crud and apis yeah there you go dude like that's that's some of your summary that's that's some of your project bullet points like seriously boom you got a highlight right there you know that's your that's your highlight reel man you gotta put that on the display front and center on your resume um okay cool and you're also talking about doing blogging and basic video tutorials um yeah then you can basically use this as your highlight reel to kind of start off the section for your articles on your cover letter okay and then you're also talking about your work with free code camp uh you're talking about your future goals fantastic as a junior developer people are really going to want to see that you still have plans to continue to grow and continue to improve yourself and that you're worth the investment of time and money that they're putting into hiring you as a junior asset definitely include something like that in your cover letter and i know this is controversial i would recommend including the photo in your cover letter or in your resume some people will strongly disagree with me on that but i think it's it's worthwhile uh you know maybe get one that's facing directly towards the camera and you know maybe wear like something relatively uh professional but overall this would be a fine photo as well okay but again yeah highlight reel men projects you've worked on but i'm front and center on that resume okay and yep you also have a portfolio looks like all of this is pertaining to the free code camp challenges cool but yeah i would definitely recommend putting in some highlights of the open source projects that you contributed to for hacktoberfest okay and then you have the contact me cool and that's nice and simple yeah in terms of the layout of this love it man nice and responsive you know this is definitely something i would also highlight in your resume probably near the top with some social media links and if you want to double down on that also highlight that on your cover letter because you want to get uh you know the these projects and these um bullet points that you you know that you've worked hard on in front of the the hiring manager and the hr professional cool it looks like you are uh highlighting things that you actually have worked on here and making use of the popular repositories so that's great you do have a fairly active graph here that's nice to see and cool and then here are some of the pull requests that you're working on for hacktoberfest with free code camp and these these other profiles i'm not too familiar with but yeah definitely as i mentioned highlight those i think we've covered all the bases i just want to thank you for sharing this resume i know it's uh can be a bit nervewracking to not only share your resume with someone else and not only share your social media presence with someone else but to share it with my audience and and everyone on free code camp so hey big shout out to akar muhammad for sharing his um some of his contact info guys definitely reach out to him his social media links are in the description below give him some kudos if you really like his portfolio as much as i did give him some kudos on this layout he did a great job same thing with the the color contrast and font use solid men i really dig it um so yeah you got a few things that you can punch up make this a little bit more skimmable add in some more skills maybe push these articles to your cover letter highlight some of the other uh work that you've done but i did do a deep dive and it looks like you've put in the work you you have solid content out there and you have a decent head for design and for layout you just need to make it pop and showcase those skills and projects a little bit more and i think you'll be a shoein for landing your first junior developer position or maybe one of your first if you if you've already landed a junior dev role so yeah thanks again uh my name is benjamin spack if you'd like me to review your resume review your portfolio a link is in the description to sign up the signup form will look pretty much just like this and you put in your email address your name uh social media links what you're looking for what industry you want to work in and the more info you provide the more info i can uh you know tailor this video to and the more value i can try to provide you all right guys well this video is running long thank you for hanging in if you watch to the end thanks for checking out free code camp and also check out my channel uh benjamin's back on youtube thanks guys have a good one
