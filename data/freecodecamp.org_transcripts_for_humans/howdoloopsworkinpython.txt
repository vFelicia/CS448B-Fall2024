00:00 - Loops are one essential part of
00:02 - programming and in Python we have two
00:05 - kinds of Loops while loops and for Loops
00:08 - while Loops are defined using the while
00:11 - keyword and they repeat their block
00:14 - until the condition is evaluated as
00:17 - false so here's a while loop with a
00:20 - counter so you you start the counter at
00:23 - zero and then while count is less than
00:26 - 10 we're going to print this count
00:28 - equals count plus one so it's going to
00:30 - increment the counter every time until
00:33 - we get to the end and other type is the
00:36 - for Loop so using four Loops we can tell
00:39 - python to execute a block for a
00:41 - predetermined amount of times up front
00:43 - and without the need of a separate
00:45 - variable and conditional to check its
00:48 - value or items here and then four item
00:50 - and items for each item in the list
00:52 - we're going to print the item pretty
00:54 - straightforward
